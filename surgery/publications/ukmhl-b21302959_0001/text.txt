Tpie favour with which successive Editions of this Work have been received not only b}’’ the Profession in this country and its colonies, but by means of Reprints in the United States of America, and through the medium of translations on the Continent of Europe, gratifying as it necessarily is to the Author, has in no small degree increased his responsibilities. The Author feels that a responsibility, weighty in proportion to the very extent of the diffusion of his Instruction, is incurred by him who takes upon himself the task of teaching others that Science which underlies the Art, and that Art, the exercise of which constitutes the application to Practice of a great branch of Medical Knowledge, which more directly than any other department of Medicine involves the physical well-being, and more immediately affects the life of those on whom it is exercised. It is not sufficient for the Teaching of a Scientific Art, such as Surgery, to be sound in those General Laws that constitute its Principles. It ^ must also be accurate in those minute details that are necessary to its successful Practice, and, above all, just in its estimate of the labours of others. A leaclier of Surgery, who seeks to give a true and impartial view of the subject of his tuition, is placed in much the same position as a Judge who is summing up a great cause. He must endeavour to divest himself of the trammels of the Schools to free himself alike from the partisanship of individual bias and the antagonism of professional prejudice.PREFACE. T1 He must lay down clearly the broad General Principles on which the L/ase rests; detail its facts in an orderly and succinct manner, draw those deductions which legitimately flow therefrom, and guide his Pupils to arrive at just conclusions by the light of his own more matured and extended experience. Feeling deeply the responsibilities that thus attach themselves to him as a Teacher, the Author has spared no exertion in endeavouring to render the Seventh Edition of “ The Science and Art of Surgery ”■ worthy of the continued confidence of the Profession. With this view the whole Work has been carefully revised, and much new and important matter has been added. The additions thus made have not been confined to any one particular part, but have been widely distributed through the various subjects of which the Work treats. They are not to be measured merely by the increased bulk of the Work, being, in reahty, far more extensive than may at first appear, as they often take the place of old matter that, having become obsolete, has been cancelled. One Hundred and Fifty new Illustrations have been added to the Text, and many of the old ones have been redrawn in an improved style. Whenever a Woodcut has been copied from another Work, the name of the Author of the Work whence it has been taken has been appended to it. When no such acknowledgment is made, the Figure is original, belongs exclusively to this Work, and, except in the case of Diagrams, has been drawn from Nature. To his friend and former Pupil, Mr. R. J. Godlee, the Author is indebted for a series of Microscopical Illustrations of Pathological Sub- jects, which have been drawn expressly for this Work. They are alike true to nature and admirable in execution, and will, it is hoped, be found of much use to the Student of Surgical Pathology. The Book has been printed in a bolder and more legible type than was employed in former Editions. But no change has been made in the general arrangement of the various subjects of which it treats. Throughout the Work it has been the object of its Author to place before the Student and Practitioner the Science and the Art of Surgeiy, not as consisting merely in the observation of such Injuries, Diseases, and Malformations, as are met with in Surgical Practice, or in thePREFACE. dexterous application of manual or operative means for tlieir relie ; but as demanding an exercise of general medical knowledge,^ an a thorougli acquaintance with all those conditions, whether intrinsic to the patient, or surrounding him, that favour or prevent his restoration to health. The remarks in the earlier part of the First Chapter, ivill, it is trusted, sufficiently indicate to the Student what is re- quired of him in order that he may become a successful Practitioner of Surgery. In every instance an endeavour has been made to give as full anc clear a description of Symptoms, Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment, as the importance of each demands, and the present state of burgical knowledge permits. The various new Operations practised in modern Surgery have been carefully described, the difficulties and dangers attending their per- formance pointed out, and the cases requiring them detailed. The growing importance of Surgical Hygiene has led to special attention being paid to it in the Chapters on Operations, Wounds, and Septic Disease. With respect to Diagnosis it may be remarked that, as accuracy in this branch is an all-important requisite for success in Treatment, the signs and symptoms by which the injury or disease under consideiatioii may be recognised, have not only been described in each case, but caie has been taken, even at the risk of occasional repetition, to point out the several conditions with which it may be confounded, and the means of distinguishing it from each of them. The Author has appended to each Volume some Addenda on subjects which have suggested themselves during the progress of the Work ^ through the Press. In order to facilitate reference to the veiy varied subjects of which the Work treats, each Volume has been furnished with a Table of Contents, a List of Illustrations, and an extended Etymological Index. It only remains for the Author to record his acknowledgments to his friends, Messrs. Beck and Tweedy, who have given him their valuable services in his endeavour to bring this Edition to the level of modern scientific Surgery. To Mr. Beck the Author is deeplyvm HE FACE. indebted for much valuable assistance througbout tbc Work but more especially in those Chapters that relate to general Sumcal Pathology. ^ In conclusion the Author can but hope that this Edition of the “Science and Art of Surgery” may not be found uncleservin» of the continued confidence of the Surgical Profession, as a g„ide° to the Practitioner, and a Text-Book for the Student in Surgery JOHN ERIC ERICHSEN. 6, Cavendish Place, London, October, 1877.CONTENTS OF THE FIKST VOLUME.

FIKST PEINCIPLES. CHAPTEE I. —*— GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON OPERATIONS. By a Surgical Operation is meant a Manual or Mechanical Process under- taken by the Surgeon for the remedy of Deformity, congerntal or acquired, or for the cure or rehef of a patient suffering from those effects of Injury or Disease, that are incurable by constitutional or ordinary local treatment, or in Avhich such treatment would be too slow in effecting the desired result. A Surgical Operation may be necessary for the following objects : 1. Remedying or Re^novmg Congenital Defects and Malformations: as Hare- lip, Club-foot, or Supernumerary Fingers or Toes. 2. Remedying Acquired Defects and Deformities : as in the Closure of Fis- tulae, the Restoration of Lost Parts, and the Correction of Distortions of the Limbs. 3. The Removal of Foreign Sulstances from the Body : as in the Extraction of a Bullet or a Calculus. 4. The Repair of the Effects of Injuries: as in the treatment of certain Fractures and Dislocations. 5. The Removal of Parts that haye been so disorganised by the effects of Injury that their vitality is lost, or that their continued connection udth the rest of the body would be a source of danger : as in Amputation for Frost-bite or Mangled Limbs. 6. The Removal^ of Diseased Structures that interfere with the utility of an organ or part: as in the Extraction of a Cataract. 7. The Removal of Diseased Structures that seriously incom’enience the patient or that remotely threaten hfe : as in the Extirpation of Tiunoius, bimple or Malignant. ’ 8.

Operative Surgery is but the application of manipulative methods to the relief and cure of injury and disease. Like every other art, he it manipida- tive, plastic, or imitative, it can only be earned to a certain definite point of excellence. An art may be modified—it may be varied—but it cannot be perfected beyond certain attainable hmits. And so it is, and indeed must be, with that of Surgery. There cannot always be fresh fields for conquest by the knife. There must be portions of the human frame that Avill CA'er remain sacred from its intrusion—at least, in the Surgeon’s hand. That AA^e haA'e nearly, if not quite, reached these final limits there can be little question. When Ave reflect that every large artery in the human body up to the aorta itself has been repeatedly ligatmcd—that each of the six large articulations and many of the smaller bones have been resected—that the am- putation of each limb up to the shoulder and hip-joints is a matter of ordinary surgical occurrence—that large tumours haAuug the most intricate anatomical comiections have been removed from every sm-gical region in the body, from the base of the brain to the lowest organ in the peMc caA'ity—when Ave reflect on triiunphs of the Surgeon’s art that are expressed by operations such as these, Ave can scarcely believe otherwise than that httle remains for the daring of the boldest to deAuse, or the skill of the most dexterous to accomplish, in the extension of that art in the direction of its operative department, and that the Siu'geon must in future be content to repeat, though possibly in a modified and improved manner, those operations that have been inaugmated by the genius and perfected by the skill of his predecessors. It is true that there are yet regions that have rarely been successfully in- vaded by the scalpel, though they haA-e been contemplated as possible seats of future surgical operations. But it has yet to be determined whether some operations recently performed for the remoAral of important organs are more than bold experiments on the power of endiu’ance of the human fr’ame ; Avhether they are surgical triumphs or operative audacities. To my mind, it appears as if we had already reached something like finahty in the mere manipulative art of Siu’gery ; though I hesitate much to use that word “ finality,” for I know weU hoAA^ apt a man is to suppose that art to the prosecution of AA'hich he has deA’oted his life to haA’e attained its final limit of perfectness. Yet, looking at the question as dispassionately as possible, Ave cannot but come to the conclusion that we can scarcely hope to pass far beyond the line at which we have arrived, in the direction of extreme precision and almost absolute certainty in the mechanical performance of the operations of siu’gery, and that in this direction the progress of modem Singeiy is nearly baiTecl. At the same time, we may reasonably exqrect that the details of the methods of practising operations may fr-om time to time be materially modified and improved by the skill of indiAidual operators, by the ingenuity of sm-gical mechanicians, or possibly by the introduction of ucav agents, such as electricity, as aids to oru- art. e >.■ Brrt if modern operatiA’e Sm-gcry has attairred to so high a pitch o per ec ion in all that relates to boldness of conception ami to precision of execution, so that we can scarcely hope to see any further progress in these directions ; and indeed, if the most adA’anced modern Surgery is seeking to lay aside the scalpel and the bistoury for milder methods of treatment—if, m fact, the practicalJiEQUISTTES FOR SUCCESS. 3 department of Surgery has, so far as our present means and onr present know- ledge are coneerned, readied, or nearly so, its final development, the case is wiefely different with the other great branch of Surgery—the scientific. For here, truly, so far from hai'ing approached the final limits of our subject, we arc but as yet halting on the threshold. And whether ive regard the science of Surgery in its relation to the essential nature, the character, the recognition, and the pathology of surgical diseases and injuries, or ivhether we consider it in reference to all those circumstances ivhich, independently of the mechanical skill of the operator, influence for good or for ill the results of his procedures, we have a field before ns as vast as it has hitherto been little cultivated. And here I do not sjieak of the mere local results ; so far as they are con- cerned, there is but little to bo desired. The results of most plastic, conserva- tive, and ophthalmic operations are as satisfactory as the most sanguine could hope for or the most critical expect. So also noth respect to that multitude of minor operations that are practised for the relief of various distressing maladies, and which are followed by the happiest consequences. But when we come to consider the issues of those gTeater and graver operations by which the life of a patient is directly imperilled, Ave are constrained to admit that success in results has lagged far behind and borne no relation to the perfection in the execu- tion of the operation, and that in this respect the highly polished Art of modern Surgery far outshines its Science. But success in the residts is, after aU, the thing to aim at, and no amoiuit of manual dexterity can compensate for its want. Dexterity is oidy one element of success, and, however important it is to be dexterous operators, it is better still to be successful ones. But it must not be supposed, that manual dexterity is to be ruidervalued—far from it. Manual dexterity is necessarily of the first adr'antage in the performance of any operation, and the Surgeon should diligently endear’diu’ to acquire the Ai-t of using his instruments Avith neatness, rapidity, and certainty. In many cases of minor moment, no other requisite is needed by the Singeon than this. But it Avould, indeed, be a fatal error to suppose that, in the majority of cases requiring surgical interference, this is the only or indeed the chief require- ment on the part of the operator. Manual dexterity must not be mistaken for surgical skill; and, desirable as it doubtless may be to be able to remoA'c a limlA, or to cut out a stone, Avith rapidity,—important, in a Avord, as it is to become a dexterous operator—it is of far greater importance to become a successful Surgeon. The object of CA’cry operation is the remoA’al of some condition that either threatens life, or interferes AA'ith the comfort and ntility of existence ; and the more safely as Avell as certainly a Singeon can accoui- plish this object, the better Avill he do his duty to his patients, and the more successful Avill he be in his practice. Success^then, in the result of an opera- tion, Avhether that result be the preserAvatioii of life or the remo\-al of a soince of discomfort, is the thing to aim at. To this, dexterity and rapidity in opera- ting are in a high degree conducive ; but there are various other considerations equally or still more necessary, the solution of Avhich can only be afforded by an intimate general acquaintance Avith the Science of Surgery and of Medicine. The Diagnosis of the nature of the local disease, and of the extent of its con- nections, has to be made ; lurking A'isceral affections must be detected and if possible, removed. The Constitution of the patient must be prepared ; he4 GENERAL REA[ARKS ON OPERATIONS. must, as far as possible, be placed in those hygienic conditions which are most faA oni able to recovery ; the best time for the performance of the operation must be seized ; and, after its completion, the general health must be attended to in such a Avay as shall best cany the patient through the difficulties he has to encounter, and any sequelfe or complications that arise must be subjected to appropriate treatment. These, as well as the simple perfonnance of the opera- tion, are the duties of the Sm'geon ; and on the manner in which they are per- foiToed, as much as, or even perhaps more than, on the mere manual dexterity displayed in the operation itself, AviU the fate of the patient depend. It is well known that the result of operations differs much in the practice of different Sm-geons of acknowledged dexterity ; and this variation in the proportionate number of recoveries cannot be accounted for by any difference in the degree of manual skill displayed in the operation itself, but must rather be sought in the greater attention that is paid by some Surgeons to the constitutional treat- ment of their patients before and after operation, and to their more perfect acquaintance mth those general laAvs that influence the success of aU the opera- tions of Siu’gery. Indeed, success in Operative Sm-geiy mainly depends on two conditions ; 1. The selection of proper cases ; that is to say, of cases in which alone an operation will probably be followed by a successful result ; and 2, The a'\'oidance or the combating of those deleterious influences, hygienic and others, to Avhich a patient may be exqDOsed after an operation, and which may directly mar its success. Two requisites are thus essentially needed to constitute a successful operator. The first is, the possession of that mechanical skill that is required for the safey efficient, and speedy performance of an operation ; the second, of at least equal importance, is the scientific knowledge requisite to determine the cases in which operation has become necessary, in which it may be practised with a reasonable prospect of benefit and success, and to decide on the means to be adopted to place the patient in the most fa^-ourable circumstances for recovery. The practice of operating in notoriously hopeless cases nfith the view of giving the patient what is called “ a last chance ” is much to be deprecated, and should never be followed. It is by operating in such circumstances, especially in cancerous diseases, that much discredit has resulted to Surgery ;■ for in a great niunber of instances the patient’s death is hastened by the pro- cedure, rrffiich, instead of giving him a last chance, only causes him to be des- patched sooner than would otheiUAUse har’e happened. It may truly be said that a great siu’gical operation, in its conception, its performance, and its com- pletion, tests the Surgeon’s medical knowledge as much and in as varied a manner as it taxes his manual skill; and that, taken as a Avhole, it is the- highest development of the medical art. CONDITIONS INFLUENCINO THE SUCCESS OF OPERATIONS. The circimrstances that mainly influence the result of an operation, so far as the recovery of the patient is concerned, may be arranged under three heads : 1 d’hose that are connected with the State, of the Patiwfs General. Health before and at the time of its performance ; 2. The Hmjiemc Comhttons by which he is sm-rounded after it is done ; and 3. The Special Dangers connected -with the operation itself.INFLUENCE OF GENERAL HEALTH. 5 1, All other circumstances being alike, the condition of a patient that principally determines the result of an operation is the State of the General Health. Indeed, success is influenced tar more by the state of the patient’s constitution than by the severity of an operation itself, or even by the mecha- nical dexterity udth vliich the Surgeon performs it. Veiy often we sec a patient carried olf by fatal disease supervening on some extremely trifling- operation, (such as the removal of a small encysted tumour,) which in itself ought in no way to endanger life, were it not that the patient’s constitu- tion was at the time of its performance in so mihealthy a state that the slightest exciting cause has been sufficient to call into activity fatal disease. So, also, it is no uncommon circumstance to , see one patient sink after the most dexterously performed operation for hernia, or stone, the ligatm-e of an artery, &c., owing to some morbid condition of the blood or of the system that disposes to low or diffuse inflammation; whilst another may possibly make the most remarkable and rapid recovery after he has been mutilated with but httle skill. Independently of actual organic disease of the viscera, of which I shall hereafter speak, there are certain conditions of the body with respect to the condition of the nervous system, the circulation, and the general physical state, that exercise an injiu’ious influence. Thus, persons of an iiritable and amxious mind do not bear operations so well as those of a more tranquil mental constitution. Those also of a feeble and iiritable habit of body, especially nervous and hysterical women, with but little strength of circulation, cannot bear up against severe siu'gical procedures, and often sink after comparatively slight ones ; being apt to become depressed and exhausted, and to sink vdthout rallying. Persons who are overloaded vdth fat are not good subjects for sm-gical operations. In them the circulation is usually feeble ; the womid heals slowly and is apt to become sloughy ; and intercinrent disease of a low type often sets in. Short of actual structin-al disease of impor- tant organs, as the liuigs, heart, or kidneys, I know no condition more mi- favomable to success after operations than premature or excessive obesity. In some states of the system the patient, although apparently in his usual health and not affected by any recognisable disease, may yet have the blood in so bad a state so charged, perhaps, udth morbid matters, that the least physical or even mental disturbance may call into activity the latent elements of mischief. It is in such conditions of the system as this that tri-vdal operations, in themselves unattended by danger, such as the extirpation of a sebaceous cyst or the removal of a pile, may be followed by severe, dangerous, and possibly fatal constitu- tional disturbance. The operation is the act that puUs the trigger and finally detemiiues the explosion of previously stored-up materials of mischief. Patients with a high temperatin-e should ne^'er be operated on except for the lelief of that vei-y condition which occasions the elevation of temperature, such as the accumulation of pus, or in one of those four great surgical emergencies that demand under all and every circumstance immediate operation ; viz. : 1, dangerous haemon-hago ; 2, impcnchng asphyxia ; 3, strangulated hernia ; and 4, over-chstended bladder. The urgency of these conditions, which may be emed the four classes of primary surgical ingency, overrides all other con- siderations. An individual of a sound constitution, that has never been impaired by6 QEXEHAL llEMAEKE ON OEEIiATlONS. excesses ot any kind, n'liosc habits have been temperate and sober, Avhose diet has been sufficient and of good quality, whoso mind has never been o^-er- stramed by the anxieties of bushiess or the labours of a professional life, and ■whose existence has been spent in rural occupations and in the pure air of the couiiti}, is neccssaiily placed in a far more faA'ourable jiosition to bear the effects of any mutilation, whether it be the result of injury, or be inflicted by the^ Hurgeon’s knife, than the man Avhose physical powers are Avorn out by actiA'c and unceasing business avocations or professional Avork, Avhose nervous system is exhausted by his anxious labours ; and infinitely more so than the poor inhabitant of a large and densely peopled toAvn, Avho has from earliest childhood inhaled an impime and fetid atmosphere, Aihose scanty diet has consisted ot the refuse of the shops, or the semi-decomposed offal of the stalls, and AAhose nervous system has been irritated and at the same time exhausted in the daily struggle for a precarious livelihood, or o\'er-stimulated by habitual excesses in strong drinks, by which he has hoped to piu’chase temporary forgetfulness of the cares of a sordid life. Though individuals AAuth such different antecedents be placed under exactly the same hygienic circum- stances afirr the perfonnance of an operation, yet the results will probably be very dissimilar, influenced as they must be by their past rather than by their iwesent condition. In the one case, the inflanmiation resulting from the incision, and I’equisite for the cure of the Avound, aaIU not OA'erstep the nomial degree necessary for the healing process. In the other it may not attain to this, but, assuming a Ioav and diffuse form, may teiminate in some of those secondary affections Avhich Avill presently be adA'erted to as occasioning death under imfiiA ourable hygienic conditions. Besides the general state of the patient’s health, the Gondition of Imjiortanf, Organs must be taken into consideration before an operation is decided on. The state of the patient’s Heart should be carefully looked to. ValA’ular disease of this organ, if early or slight, need not be an obstacle to most operations, especially those of expediency. But fatty degeneration of the heart, as indicated by its feeble action, by inegularity and want of power in the circulation, by breathlessness, and by a distinctly marked arcus senilis, should make the Surgeon careful in undertaking any operation attended Avith much loss of blood or shock to the nervous system. Such a condition of heart is liable to occasion great depression of strength, syncope, and death —often sudden—some days after the operation. In cases of chronic disease that it would otherwise be proper to submit to operation, this condition of the heart becomes a serious obstacle. But it need not be a bar to opera- tion in acute cases that Avould be speedily fatal if left to themselves, and certainly not in one of the four conditions of primary sm-gical urgency. Disease of the Lungs, of a tuberculous chai’acter, AA'hen actiA'c or adA’auced, is incompatible Avith the success of an operation; but under certain circimAstances, as AA'ill be explained Avhen speaking of diseases of the joints and fistula in ano, an operation is justifiable and proper, CA'en though the patient be consumptive. If the Liver be diseased organically, if it be in a state of amyloid degenera- tion, or affected by cinhosis, and more especially if any symptoms of ascites have supervened, no operation but for the relief of disease that instantly threatens life should be undertaken.7 DIET AFTER OFEEATIOF. Perhaps the most serious constitutional affections, and these that more than any others militate against the success of an operation, are diseased Kidneiis, Avith albuminuria and diabetes; in these conditions, the local inflam- matory action that is set up is apt to run into a Ioav, diffuse, and sloughing form, and this is especially the case in all operations about the pelvic and genito-urinary organs. The contamination of the patient’s system by Malignant Disease must always prevent our operating, as a speedy return of the affection mil most certainly take place. And, lastly, no operation, save of the most urgent neces- sity, in cases that tall within the category of one of the four classes of prmiary surgical lu-gency, and tlms intended to rescue the patient from impending death, should eA-e'i- be performed whilst he is labouring under Pya3mia, Septiemmia, Erysipelas, Phlebitis, or any Diffuse Inflammation ; and even during the epidemie jireA’alence of these affections, operations that are not of immediate necessity should be postponed until a more favourable season. Operations in A'eiy old people, if severe and attended by much shock to the system, are commonly fatal; amputations in individuals above the age of seventy, are very rai’ely successful. 2. The Hygienic Conditions to which a patient is exposed both before and after an operation, will most materially influence its results. These conditions are of two kinds 1. As regards the diet of the patient, and 2. As concerns his exposure to a A'itiated atmosphere contaminated by the emanations from the sick and wounded, such as is commonly met with in the wards of an over- croAvded or ill-constructed hospital.* The proper regulation of the patient’s Diet before and after an operation is of gTeat consequence. On this point it is impossible to lay doAvn any very definite rule, as much depends not only on the patient’s preAious habits of life, but on the natiu’c of the operation itself; and, as this subject AAflU be discussed at the end of the Chapter, it need not detain us here. It is not, hoAvever, often that in ciAul practice the insufficient quantity or the bad quality of the patient’s food, AAith AA'hich he is supplied after the performance, influences materially the result of an operation. But in military and naval practice in time of war the case is far different. The soldier or the sailor on active serAuce is often exposed to serious injuries that necessitate the more important operations at a time Avhen his constitutional poAvers have already been broken doAAii by scuny, dysentery, or some other similar affection, resulting as much from the deficient quantity as from the uuAA’holesome character of the food AAuth Avhich alone he ban be supplied. And after the operation his only available nutriment may be of the coarsest character, possibly salted, and imperfectly cooked. In such circmnstaucos operation-Avounds do not heal, or they assmne a peculiar gangre- nous character ; or the patient sinks from ulceration of the intestinal mucous membrane. The mortality of operations becomes enormously increased ; and there can be little doubt that thousands of deaths AA’hich haA’e occiuTed in Avars betAveen the most ciA’ilised nations and the best appointed armies may be attributed to these causes. The Hygienic Conditions to Avhich the patient is subjected after an operationS GENERAL REALARKS ON 0PERA2L0AIS. • f ■'“T’,'"® cii-cumBtanccs mito iihicli, IB pertormcd-whethcr it is dcio in a private lioiK, where the patient may bo isolated, fined il-om the ohaiice of all eoiitamiiiatioii, and BuiTomided by every military precaution; or in a hospital, where he must necessarily be exposed to emanations possibly of a septic and infections character from other patients, where the building may be impregnated by the exhalations fr-om generations of sick and injiu-ed, and where sanitary measiu-es may be neutralised by the conditions generated by a A-ast assemblage of sick under one roof. Then, again, the circumstances in Avhich a patient is placed after an operation for an accident of civil life are necessarily very different from those that sm-round one Avho is exposed to the peculiar perils that are necessaiily connected vdth mih'tary hospitals and ambulances in time of active war, and which Avill be more frilly described in the chapter on Gunshot-wounds. Ill private practice, ill residts may follmv operations fr-om thi-ee different causes, viz.: self-infection of the patient, in consequence of the retention of decomposing and putrescent secretions in the wound ; comcyauce of infection by the Surgeon ; and general faulty sanitary aiTangements of the house. In hospital practice these different somces of danger must necessarily exist to the same if not to a gTeater extent than in priA'ate. In hospital, however, just as in jlrivate practice, these particular dangers are all preventable, and disease of a septic character ought not to be allowed to generate itself thi’oiigh their medium. The frequency of such an occiuTence is in the direct ratio of the want of hygienic attention bestowed upon the patient. But in addition to these causes of disease, there exists in hospitals one special som’ce of danger Avhich leads to the excessive mortality that up to a recent period has iirevailed in most of these institutions, and ivhich unfortiuiately is still alloived to be prevalent in some. This danger results from the accumulation of large numbers of sick and injured people in one building. Tyndall has shown that the atmosphere is loaded with minute particles of organic matter in a state of suspension. Other observers have proved microscopically that these particles A'ary under different conditions, and consist of the detritus of the solid materials that frmu’sh them—neces- sarily varying in its composition according to the source whence it is de- rived. Parkes, who has examined the air of crowded buildings, such as militaiy hospitals, baiTacks, &c., finds that it contains large quantities of epithelium from the skin and i^erhaps the mouth. He states that all the specific diseases may be caused by the presence of organic impurities floating in the air, and that whether these exist in the form of impalpable powder of moist or dried epithelium, or pus-ceUs, is a matter for futine inquiry.* These are either absorbed by the liuigs and skin, or the pulmonary and cutaneous sinfaces are luiable to set free their excreta in an atmosphere ah-eady surcharged ; the blood becomes thereby vitiated, and Ioav, difPuse, or erysipelatous inflannnations of all kinds, with pytemia, sej)ticcemia, or sloughing phagedtena, are the necessary consequences. In fact, these diseases may, if the term is allowable, be manufactured in any hospital or house, howcA'cr clean and well situated, by the accumulation Avithin it of too large a number of patients suffering fr-om suppurating wounds. * “ Maimal of Practical Hygiene,” pp. 88, 00, 100. 1809.OVERCROWDING TO BE AVOIDED. 9 This fact is abundantly proA'cd Ijy the experience of all military sm-geons ; and I have had occasion to notice it in ordinary hospital practice. It has been found in the wards of University College Hospital that, if the number ot patients suttering from suppurating wounds exceeds a certain proportion of the cases, septic disease will inevitably be engendered. Overcroivding of patients after operations is thus one of the most fertile causes of disease and death; for the over-crowding of wounded people,^ whether the wounds be accidental or sm-gical, Avill inexhtably produce one of the four septic diseases — phagedaena, septicemia, pyemia, or erysipelas. AVhen the word “ overcrowding ” is used in connection with sm-gical hygiene, it does not mean the heaping together of the sick and wounded in one building beyond what it is intended to hold ; but it means the accumulation in one ward or luider one roof of a gi-eater number of patients than is compatible Avdth such purity of air as to render the septic poison incapable of development or of propagation in it. The two great conditions to be attended to in the prevention of o^■cr- crowding are :—(1) Sufficient cubic space for each patient: and (2) an efficient system of ventilation. Both conditions are equally necessary. The s^acc afforded to each patient in the siu'gical ward of an hospital where l^atients with suppurating wounds are mixed with others suffering from such iujiu'ies as simple fractures, unattended by breach of siu’face, should be at least 1500 cubic feet, and this should be changed by ventilation, once, if not twice, in the hour. If the proportion of simple cases be great, less than this may be safe ; but if the majority of the patients have suppm-ating wounds, more s]Dace, as much as 2000 cubic feet, must be allowed. Whenever we have had an outbreak of the low sm-gical diseases—of erysipelas, sloughing phage- dasna, or pyaemia—in the wards at University College Hospital, it has been owing to the accidental and, perhaps, unavoidable accumulation of a large number of serious injm-ies or of operation-cases in one ward, so that, although the cubic space for each patient remained the same as usual, it became inadequate owing to the peculiar gravity of the cases. It is then the natiu-e of the injuries and diseases rather than the mere number of the patients that vitiates the air of a ward. Hot only, however, is space required, but change of air, by proper ventilation, is equally needful. For, however large the cubic space for patients, the air, if not changed rapidly enough, soon becomes loaded with animal exhalations, and highly insalubrious. Hence care should be taken that a fr-ee cmTcnt of pm-e air through the ward be maintained dayaild night. It is fr-om w'ant of this precaution during night especially that much mischief often results. Ihe importance of maintaining efficient ventilation during night, and the little danger to be apprehended from the admission of cold night air, have been so forcibly pointed out by Miss Nightingale in her Notes on Nursing, and are now so imiversally admitted, that I need not do more than add the testimony of my experience to the truth of her obser\-ations. In cold weather, also, there is so gi-eat a disposition on the part of nm-ses and patients to shut up wards and rooms, that the air becomes close, oppressive, and contaminated ; and hence it is that the erysipelatous and miasmatic diseases are so rife uring winter and early spring. The “ East Wind ” is commonly accused of .being the cause of these ; and no doubt it is so, but only indirectly, by causingGENERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. lO Aviudo^re ami doors to be shut, so as to exclude the cold tlmt usuaUy accom- panies that wind, amUhus rendering the atmosphere impiue. It is impossible 0 o\ er-estimate the importance of a free supply of pure air in lessem’ng the mortality after operations, not only in hospitals, but equally in private dwellings. ^ e fact has often been observed in military practice, and the recent Franco- :<eimau 1 ai biought it into strong relief^—that those Avounded fare best Avho arc treated in open huts or tents, whilst those Avho arc placed in the apparently more favourable conditions afforded by regular houses become decimated by those scoiuges of military siugical practice, pyaemia and hospital gangTene. It is the difference in the hygienic aiTangements in dilfereut hospitals that more than any other condition influences the varying rate of mortality in difiereut institutions ; and it is obAvous that, ccuteris parilus, those ]jatients AA'iU haA’e the best prospect of recoA’ery who are most scrupulously attended to in this respect; that no cases of operation shoifld be placed ill ill-A eiitilatcd Avards, or in those that contain more than a certain percentage of patients AA'ith siipjairating wounds ; and that the performance of operations ill close and ill-ventilated rooms, or in houses situated in overcroAA^ded neigh- bom-hoods, should, as far as possible, be aA'oided. The mortality arising from inattention to these A*arious hygienic conditions is not a necessity of the operation, but rises or falls according as the circum- stances in AA'hich the jiatient is placed depart more or less Aiddely from those conditions that are necessary to the maintenance of health. It is by the induction of iiyaemia and of the erysipelatous inflammations, AAuth fcA’er of a low tyqie, that the neglect of the hygienic conditions of ojxirated patients destroys life. The pre\-alence of these diseases in an institution is the measiue of, and in direct proportion to, the neglect of the sanitary arrangements in it. These diseases are preA'entable and ought to be prevented. Surely the first and more essential requisite of a hospital should be that it is not a source of disease to its inmates—that those Avho are compelled to seek its aid do not suffer fr’om its effects. The exposiue of a patient after an operation to the contagious mnanations of septic diseases fr’oni other sick or AA'oimded patients, is attended by the most fatal consequences. WheiieA'er it is practicable, CA'ery case of septic disease, such as pytemia, erysiiielas, inflamed absorbents or veins, or hospital gangrene, should be rigorously excluded from the ward or room in AA'hich other patients Avith operation-Avounds happen to be lying ; and, if possible, the same nurses, dressers, or surgeons shoidd not be alloAved to go fr’om the infected to the healthy, nor should the same appliances, di’essings, or sponges be used for both. Great care also should be taken in the pirrification of the bedding tliat has been used by patients suffering from septic disease ; the blankets especially are apt to harbour infection long, and must be thoroughly pm'ified. EA’ory hospital Siugeon must haA’e had abundant occasion to deplore many deaths after oiAeration, arising from preA'entable causes due to AA'ant of attention to these simple precautions. 3. The Special Conditions directly excited by the Operation itself, predisposed to by the cii’ciunstances that Ave haA’c just been considering, and AA'hich commonly lead to a fatal result, of Avhich they are the inunediate occasion, are the folloAving :—Shock, Exhaustion, Hinmorriiage, Gangrene, Tetanus,11 CAUSES OF DEATH AFTER OFERATIOX. Py®raia, Scpticiemia, and the various Low, DifRrsc, and Erysipelatous luflom- Illations. These causes of death are so various, and comprise so many distinct diseases, that I shall do Uttlo more here than mention them; referring the reader to the ditferent chapters in the body of the Avork, m Aidiich each is specially treated. „ The Shoch of an Operation may prove fatal in various ways : tvom cue severity of the mutilation, as in a case of double amputation ; fi-om the nervous centres lieing- implicated, as in the removal from the face of large timiom-s that have connections ivith the base of the skull ; from fear, oi’ the state of nervous depression, into which the patient has previously fallen, causing him to feel the influence of an operation disproportionately to its severity. These various effects of shock have, howeA'er, been much lessened since amesthetics have been generally administered in oixirative simgery. Aiuesthesia, however, does not remove the physical impression produced on the system by a seA'ere mutilation; hence the influence of a serious and prolonged operation is still manifested in the production of shock, of collapse, and of sloAV recovery, even though the patient hav'e suffered no actual pain. Certain operations appear to exercise a peculiar depressing effect on the nervous system, even though no pain be experienced. Thus, in castration, at the moment of the dfrision of the spermatic cord, the pulse A\ill sink markedly, even though the patient have been fully auEesthetised. So much is this the case, that it is well at that moment to suspend the administration of the anEesthetic. Exhaustion, mthout any tangible local or constitutional disease, is an occa- sional cause of death after severe operations ; more particularly in delicate females, in feeble or debilitated subjects, in those Avho have lost much blood, or who have become Aveakened by protracted suppuration. Hcemorrhage, if very copious, may destroy the patient by inducing sjmeope that may be immediately fatal; or by increasing the influence of the shock so that he camiot rally ; or it may be folloAved by serious after-consequences, such as the supervention of hEemorrhagic or irritative fever, and a disposition to the occiuTence of low and erysipelatous inflammations. During the performance of an operation, hEBinorrhage should, as much as possible, be prevented ; the operation itself is a cause of depression, and any great loss of blood not only seriously aggvaA'ates this, but disposes to the after-occuiTence of pyiAsmia and loAV inflammations. It is in these secondary and indirect effects that the great danger of excessive hEemorrhage lies. Blood is a very complex fluid ; if once bst it is not easily replaced, more especially in advanced years. At any period of life, its excessive loss may permanently impair the constitutional l)OAvei-s. Patients Avho have lost much blood make sloAV recoveries, often inter- luptcd by intercuiTent diseases ; and not unfrequently die at the end of tAVO or three Aveeks, from some asthenic visceral complication. In fact, it is in this *Avay, rather than from its immediately dangerous consequences, that the loss of a large quantity of blood at an operation proA'OS injurious to the patient. When luEmoiThagc occurs a fcAV hours, or a dfiy or tAVO, after an operation, it usually proceeds from imperfect ligature of the Aussels, or froin arteries bleeding aftei' the setting-in of reaction, Avhich had not fuiuishcd blood Avhilst the patient Avas under the influence of the shock of operation. On recoA'cry from ana3sthesia also, it not unfrequently happens that arteries begin to spout, AA'hich yielded12 GENERAL BEMAEKS ON OPERATIONS. little or no blood whilst the patient was in a state of nncesthesia. In these circnmstances, hajmorrhage is of far less moment, and lees freqncntly fatal, than Mheu it occurs at a later period, m consequence of some morbid condition of the wound or system, and usually in association with an asthenic state, by which the proper formation of plastic matter is interfered Avith. Gamjremx^ not a common cause of death after operations, except in the phagedtemc form in militery practice in time of wai-. When it occurs in cn-il hospital practice, it is the result, in most cases, of faulty but prevent- able hygienic conditions, and its frequency in any institution is the direct measure of, and of itself a conclusive proof of; neglected or defective sanitary arrangements. In the local form it may, however, occiu- without being the result of want of hygienic precautions, but from pm-ely local conditions, as in a limb fr’om excessive traiunatic violence, or in a strangulated hernia in conse- quence of excessive strangulation of the gut before operation. Tetanus but rarely occasions death after operations in this coimtry. When it does occiu', it is more fr-equently after the lesser than after the gi-eater opera- tions that it developes itself. Internal Inflammations of an acute and active character may carry off the jiatient after an operation in two ways. Inflammation of this kind may have existed antecedently to the operation, being the disease for which it is per- formed ; and, being luichecked by the ojieration, may continue its course and destroy life. Thus, when a child dies after tracheotomy for croiqi, death is not in general occasioned by the operation, but by the extension into the lungs of the disease for which it has been performed. Or the inflammation may be the necessary and direct consequence of the operation ; as when peritonitis occurs after the operation for strangulated hernia, or arachnitis after the skull has been trephined. But it is not by the action of any of these direct results that an operation usually proves fatal. In the gxeat majority of instances, death is occasioned in a more indirect manner by the development of pyeemic or eiy- sipelatous inflammations, to which a neglect of hygienic laws acts as a jDOwerfol predisposing cause. Septic disease, in one or other of its forms, is certainly the most frequent cause of death after operations, more particularly in large tomis. It is especially and directly predisposed to by the neglect of hygienic laws by the jDatient previously to the operation, and by the unfa'S'Oiu’able sanitary conditions by which he may be siuTounded after its performance. Closely allied to pyiBmia and septicaemia, frequently co-existing ndth them, having the same pre- disposing causes, and associated ndth febrile disturbance of an asthenic type, are the various loiv and diffuse inflammations, whether assumuig the form of ery- sipelas, of phlebitis, or of inflammation of the absorbents, which are the di’ead of siu’geons and the scourge of hospitals. It is to pyasmia, and to these vai-ious allied erysipelatous and low inflammations, nith their attendant asthenic con-' stitutional disturbance, that at least three-fourths of the deaths after operations are due. It is in the production of these diseases that an impure blood, loaded with efiete materials retained through habitual disregard of the ordinary rules of health, or through defective elimination by the kidneys and skin, acts as a i:)otent predisposing cause, requiring but some injury or womid to call into activity a most dangerous amount of local infliimmation and of constitutionalPREPARATION- FOR OPERATION. 13 disturbance. In these circumstances, it is not the extent or size of the n'ouncl that determines the dangerous results. The mere fact of a breach of sm-face, howcTcr trivial, is sufficient to excite these morbid processes, the materials for which have been previously stored up in the system. In such conditions of tlie system, the amputation of a toe may be as fatal as that of the thigh, or the removal of a small atheromatous cyst of the scalp as the ablation of the breast; the additional danger essentially connected with the greater operations being the only increased risk fi'om shock and hasmonhage. Diphtheritic Inflammation may develope in a wound with or without con- comitant throat-atfection. It may be developed by direct contagion, or under the influence of those local epidemics or constitutional influences that cause diphtheria to appear in the fauces. IVhen a womid becomes affected in this way, the edges and the integument for some little distance around are swollen, bravmy, and of a deep red colour ; the surface of the woimd is covered Avith a greyish Avhite exudation Avhich caimot be cleaned off; the skin nearest to the Avoimd also becomes besmeared AAith tenacious creamy-looking exudation matter ; and febrile symptoms of a low ty^De develope themselves. PREPARATION FOR OPERATION. The Slugeon, being cominced of the necessity of having recourse to operation, should fully and mn'eservedly lay before his patient the state of the case, and, if necessary, give the reasons that render an operation imperativ'e, in order to obtain his consent and that of his family. In the event of the patient refusing to submit, Avhat coiuse should the Siugeon piusue ? In this he must be guided partly by the nature of the proposed operation ; and partly by the state of the patient, and his capabihty of forming a correct judgment of his case. If the operation be one of expediency, merely for the relief of an infirmity or the- removal of an ailment AAhich does not directly jeopardise life, most certainly no Surgeon Avould think of undertaking it AAithout the full consent of his patient. If, on the other hand, it be an operation that is imperatively necessary for the preseiwation of life, in which the delay of a few minutes or hours may be fatal to'the patient, as in one of the four cases of extreme siugical urgency, viz., dangerous hemorrhage, asphyxia, over-distended bladder, or strangulated hernia, and Avhere the patient, unaware of, or incapable of being made to understand, the necessity for immediate action, is nuAA'illing to assent to the proposal, the Surgeon Avill truly be placed in a dilemma of anxious responsibility ; betAveen alloAving the patient to fall a sacrifice to his obstinacy, if^orance, or timidity, and attempting, perhaps unsuccessfully, to rescue him from inevitable death against his oaa'ii consent. I belicA’C the proper course for the Surgeon to pursue under such circumstances, is to judge for the patient in a matter on Avhich he is clearly unable to form an opinion, and to compel him, so far as is legal and practicable, to submit to the necessary steps for the- preservation of his life, or to put him under anmsthetics, and, Avhen he is> unconscious, to perform any operation that may be necessary. In the event of the patient being insensible, as after an injiuy of the head, the Surgeon must necessarily take upon himself to act as the case requires. Children "cannot be considered capable of giAung an opinion as to the propriety of an operation • the consent of the parents is here necessary, and quite sufficient ; and, in their14 OEXERAL REMARKS OX ORERATIOXS. absence, the ease being an nrgent one, the Surgeon must stand in loco parentis and take all responsibility npon himself. ’ Ihese points then having been determined, the patient should, if possible, be Piepaieclfoi the Ojperahon. In a great number of cases reejuiring operation, as in strangulated heinia, bad compound fracture, &c., no time is allowed for preparation, but the Singeon must at once sulmiit the patient to the knife, whatever the state of his constitution may be. But in the more chronic cases' time is given for improwng the constitution. This preparation must not consist in any routine system of purging and star^dng, which is ill calculated to support the constitution against the call that ivill be made upon its powers ; nor, on the other hand, in blindly adopting a tonic or stimulating regimen,' which may produce fever, and ii-ritate the constitution ; but in adapting our means to the condition of the patient and the nature of the operation'to be performed. The tendency to erysipelas, pyaimia, and low and diffuse inflam- mations generally, is materially lessened by supporting the patient’s strength, by means of a nutritious diet, previously to the performance of the operation. Indeed, in many of the more severe injimies and surgical diseases, it is only by the use of a nutritious diet, and by the administration of tonics, quinine, or iron, and stimnlants, often in large quantities, that the patient can be brought into a condition to bear the shock and consequent depression of the operation. This is more particularly the case with hospital patients of bad constitution, who have met uith serious accidents, attended by much suppuration and irritafrh'c fever. In the more chronic cases, the time should be seized for the operation when the temperature of the body is not too high, the secretions are free, the tongue clean, and the action of the skin and kidneys in a healthy state ; and, above all, the mind shordd be kept tranquil and hopeful, being allowed to dwell as little as possible upon the impending e'S'ent. In many operations, as those on the rectum and urinary organs, or in those of a plastic character, special modes of preparation are required, Avhich unll be discussed when we come to treat of the operations in detail. The Immediaie Preparations for the operation shoxdd ahvays be super- intended by the Surgeon himself. He must see that the table is solid, and of a convenient height, well coA’ered vdth blankets, and iwovided Avith pillows ; and that the light of the room is good. There must be a sufficient supply of sponges and of basins, AAith hot and cold Avater ; and, if the operation be likely to be attended by much htemorrhage, a tray filled AAuth sand or saAV-dust shoidd be proA'ided, in order to catch the blood. The Surgeon must then look over his instruments, comparing them, if the operation be complicated, AA'ith a list preA'iously made out ; he must see that they arc aiTanged in the order in AA'hich they are AA'anted, and properly coA'ered Avith a tOAvel. Much of the successful performance of an operation depends on the attention and steadiness of the assistants. Of these there should be enough, but not too many. In all capital oj)crations three or four Avill be required ; one tor the administration ot the anoBsthetic, another to command the artery, a third immediately to assist the Siu’geon, and the fourth to hand sponges, instruments, &c. The duties of the assistants should be performed in silence, and each man must carctully attend to his OAvn business, and not neglect this, as is too often done, in his anxiety to crane oA'er and see Avhat the Surgeon is about. There should be no mine-15 EMPLOYMENT OF ANjESTJIETIGS. ccssaiy talking Avlien once the patient is on the table ; the Surgeon’s directions ought to be conveyed by a brief word or two, by a look, or by a sign with the hand. The Siu-geon himself must always feel the heavy responsibility that hangs over him dm-ing the performance of a great operation—‘‘ at that moment when,” as Dr. Grant has elegantly said, “Death everywhere surrounds his knife as he is endeavouring to com-ey all his knowledge to its point.” But having carefully considered each successive step of the operation, provided for every emergency that can by any possibility arise in the course of it, and trusting in Him, from whom all knowledge is derived, to strengthen his judg- ment and guide his hand ai-ight, he will proceed to the performance of his duty with self-reliance, and in the full confidence of being able to effect all that Art can accomiilish. EMPLOYMENO? OP AN.2ESTHETICS. It is reasonable to believe that the prevention of pain in siu’gical operations has been an object of solicitude to Surgeon as well as to patient from the earliest ages: and there can be little doubt that narcotics of curious kinds have at different times been employed -with this ^iew. But the effect of these was so uncertain— their after-consequences perhaps so injurious—that no permanent reliance was placed upon thein. The first endeavoiu- to induce anaesthesia by the inhalation of vapoiu-s is stated to have leeen made in the thirteenth centiuy by Theodoric, who recommended that a “ Spongia Somuifera,” impregnated with sinrituous extracts of various narcotic substances, should bo held to the nostrils till sleep was induced ; and that after the operation the patient should be roused by the use of Hnegar or fenugreek. It was not, however, till the commencement of this century that any serious attempts were made in this direction. The discovery of the remarkable properties exercised on the nervous system by the inhalation of nitrous oxide, then led Sir Humphiy Davy and others to entertain hopes that it might be used as a means of relieving pain dining singical operations. Experiments were made with the gas vith this liew, but they did not prove altogether satisfactoiy, audit was abandoned, except as a means of amusement. It is needless to do more than allude to such means as the compression of the nerves of the limb, as recommended by Moore—the employment of exces- sive venesection, as adopted by Wardrop—or the production of insensibility by mesmerism by Esdaile and others. These means of inducing anassthesia were either inefficient, dangerous, or chimerical. It was not until 1841 that a serious attempt was again made to introduce insensibility by inhalation during operations : and to the Americans is un- doubtedly due the honour of having established the practice of Ana3sthesia in Surgery. In that year Horace AVells, a dentist of Hartford, Connecticut, inhaled the nitrous oxide gas with a vieiv of rendering himself insensible during the extraction of a tooth • and, finding the experiment succeed, re- peated it on severa,! of his patients. Its success was not, howei'cr, permanent ; and hanng faded ]ii several cases, he seems to have given up the attempt. In 1846 Dr. Morton, a dentist, and a pupil of Wells, used the vapom of ether mstrad of the nitrous oxide gas ; and, having succeeded in extracting several teeth painlessly, applied to the authorities of tlic IMassachusctts General16 OEN'ERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. Hospital at Boston for permission to administer it to a man from whom Dr. J. C. WaiTon wtis about to remoA'e a tumour of the neck. The result was most successful. The news of this great discovery was innnediatcly sent to England, where the first operations on patients antesthetised by the inhalation of the vapour of ether, were perfonned at the University College Hospital by Tiiston, who amputated a thigh and tore out an ingrowing toe-nail 'without any suffering to the patient. At these operations I was present; they were performed on Dec. 22, 184G ; and from that time the use of antesthetics has been established in surgical practice in CA'ery civilised country. For more than a year, sulphuric ether was the only agent habitually used for inducing anaesthesia. But during the whole of this period many professional men Avere busy -wfith experiments on the anaesthetic influence of various kinds of vapours ; and in November, 1847, Professor Simpson, of Edinbiu-gh, pub- lished an account of the anaesthetic properties of chloroform. In this country this agent soon came to be generally employed, although ether held its ground with the American sin-geons, by many of whom it is preferred to chloroform at the present time. The employment of AncRsthdks in Simgery is undoubtedly one of the greatest boons ever conferred upon mankind. To the patient it is invaluable in pre- venting the occiUTence of pain, and to the Surgeon in relieving him fr-om the distress of inflicting it. Anaesthesia is not, hoAvever, an unmixed good. E^’ery agent by AA^hich it can be induced produces a powerful impression on the system, and may occasion dangerous consequences Avhen too fr’eely or carelessly given ; and eA'en Avith eA’ery possible care, it appears certain that the inhalation of any anmsthetic agent is in some cases almost ineAutably fatal. We cannot purchase immimity fr'om suffering without incurring a certain degree of risk from the A'ery agent Avhich gives us ease. There can, however, be little doubt that many of the deaths that haA'e followed the inhalation of Anaesthetics have' resulted from Avant of knowledge or of due care on the part of the administrators. Yet, AvhateA’er precautions be taken, there is reason to fear that a fatal result must occasionally happen. This immediate risk, Avhich is but very small, is more than coimterbalanced by the immunity from other dangers which used formerly to occiu’ during operations. There is, however, another question in relation to Anaasthetics AA’^hich deserves' the most serious consideration on the part of the Simgeon ; yiz., Do they in- fluence the rate of mortality after operations ? On this point there is conflicting- testimony. Simpson has published statistics to shoAV that the mortality- after operations has lessened since the introduction of chlorofoim J. Arnott, on the other hand, adduces figin-es to prove that it has materially increased, in amputation by 12, in lithotomy by as much as 28 per cent. I am inclined to believe that the rate of mortality has increased since the use of Ana3sthetics in operative surgeiy. But is this increase altogether, or indeed to any degree, due to any effect produced on the system by the inhalation of Anaesthetics ?' Is it not in reality rather the indirect than the direct results of the employnmnt of Antesthetics ? May it not, in some measure at least, be OAAung to operations being often performed in very doubtfid or extreme cases, noAV that they can be done painlessly, AA'hen formerly the suffering inflicted Avould have deterred the Surgeon from proposing, or the patient from acceding to, their pcrfomance ?ADMINISTRATION OF CHLOROFORM. 17 A sm-gical operation was formerly, from the pain attending it, looked upon as a jnore serions aflair than it is at the present day, and surgeons were not wlhng to inflict suffering unless there were a good prospect of a successful issue. Now, however, that the most serious operations can be performed ^^^thout any consciousness of suffering, the Surgeon, in his anxiety to give his patient a chance of life, may not unfrequently operate for disease or injury that would otherwise necessarily and speedily be fatal, and which formerly would have been left without an attempt at relief. But there is another cause that may account for this increased rate of mortality. Dm-ing the last thirty years, the actual number of operations performed in hospitals has enoi'mously increased, and probably in a great measure owing to the employment of anesthe- tics. Hence hospital wards have become more crowded than formerly urth .severe operation-cases, and the causes of septic diseases have become much more rife, those diseases more fi'equent, and the mortality proportionately augmented. Making, however, all allowance for the extension of operative Surgery to extreme cases that were formerly not thought to come within its range, I cannot but thinlc that chloroform does exercise a noxious influence on the ■constitution, and does lessen the prospect of recovery in certain states of the system, more esjiecially when the blood is in an unhealthy state. In such circumstances, the depressing influence of chloroform appears to me to act injiu-iously ; the patient does not rally well after the operation, and inmiunity from suffering is pmehased by a lessened chance of recovery. Anaesthesia by the Administration of Chloroform is best commenced before the patient leaves his bed. The chloroform should never be given but by a person accustomed to its use, and on whose capability the Surgeon has full rehance ; as nothing is more embarrassing during an operation, than to have any doubt about the chloroform being properly administered. Chloroform may be .administered in many different ways, either on lint or on a handkerchief, or through an inhaler of some kind. The follovdng is the way in which chlorofoim may most safely be given on lint or a handkerchief, Anthout apparatus of any kind. On a piece of folded lint, about two inches square, and consisting of three doubles, about a di'achm of chloroform is poiu’ed ; and the lint is then held at a distance of about three inches from the nose of the patient, so as to permit a very fi-ea admixture of air Avith the first few inhalations of the vapoiu-. After the lapse of about half a minute, the lint is brought nearer to the patient’s i\ose, to AAithin a distance of perhaps an inch, being ncA'cr alloAvcd to touch ; at the same time a porous tOAvel, not doubled, is lightly laid OAnr the face of the patient and the hand of the operator, so as to preA'ent the escape of the chloroform-A'apour, but not to interfere AAoth the admission of air. During the whole time, it is the duty of the administrator to keep his hand on the pulse, to Avatch the breathing, and occasionally to examine the pupils of the patient. The method just described ansAvers Avell enough in most cases, but it affords no means of ascertaining the proportion of chloroform in the air Avhich is being in- haled by the patient. The administrator can judge only by the effects prodimed. There is a danger of the patient’s lungs being filled Avith a A'ery strong mixture • at the moment when the signs of an oA'erdose ai’o first perceived. IiUhe most VOL.

Various inhalers have been contrived for the pur[iosc of regulating the pro- portion of chlorofoiTu m'th accimacy. The simplest kind consists of a maslv coA'ering the nose and mouth, with a box for sponge or blotting- paper on Avhich the chloroform is poiu’ed, and mth i-ah^es to prei'ent the expired air fi-om glassing through the chloroform- chamber. The objection to this form is, that it yields a very strong mixture at &st; and, when the chloroform has half evaporated, the remainder is so cooled that it evaporates too slowly to yield enough chloroform to insime the quietude of the patient, especially Fig. l._Clover’s Chloroform Appmatus._ pg gp^ldd mOA'C his head about so as to get a small quantity of air betiveen his face and the mouth- piece. Snow improved this apparatus by siuTounding the chloroform-chamber- Avith water, and also making the upper valve movable, so that at the beginning of the inhalation only a portion of the inspired air should pass over the chloroform. This was a great improvement; but accinacy Avas not secured, because the proportion of chloroform given up varies with the temperatine of the room, Avith the sloAniess or rapidity of the patient’s breathing, and Aidth the cooling of the chloroform, which is not entirely jireA-ented by the- Avater-jacket. Clover has deA'ised an ajDparatus, consisting of a bag holding 8000 cubic inches of air, which is sus- pended from the coat-collar at the back of the administrator, and con- nected Avith the face-piece by a flexible tube (Fig. '•>). The bag is charged by means of a belloAVS (Fig. 1, 1) measming 1000 cubic inches ; and the air is passed through Fig. 2.—Ailmiiiisti'iitioii of Cliloiofonii by Clover’s a boX Alarmed Alith hot AVatCl, illto Apparatus. AA'liich is introduced, at each filling of the belloAVS, as much chloroform as is required for 1000 cubic inches of air. This is done Avith a graduated glass syringe (Fig. 1, 2) adjusted by a19 EFFECTS OF CHLOROFORM. scrcAV on the piston-rod to take np no more than the quantity determined on, which is usually from 30 to 40 minims. When the bag is full enough, the tube is removed from the evaporating vessel, and the mouthpiece (Fig. 1, 3) adapted to it. The patient cannot get a stronger dose than the bag is charged Avith ; but the proportion can be made any degree weaker, by regulating the size of an opening in the mouthpiece, which admits addi- tional air. The result of Clover’s experience with this instrument is of the most favourable character. He has administered this anesthetic in many thousand cases Avithout an accident of any kind. The principal points to be attended to dxu’ing the inhalation of this potent agent are, that it be not gix'en too suddenly, or in too concentrated a form ; and that, Avhilst under its influence, the patient be not raised into the erect or sitting position. If hut be used, it may be too much saturated, and be held too closely applied to the mouth and nostrils ; and the patient A\dll not be able to get sufficient air, and may speedily become partially asphyxiated, choking violently, strugghng to get free, and becoming purple in the face, with a full slow pidse. Care should be taken not to compress the abdomen in holding the patient; for, as the respiration becomes chiefly or. AvhoUy diaphragmatic, it may be seriously interrupted by any pressure on the abdominal wall. 'V\Tiilst under the influence of chloroform, the patient should neA’er be raised up, as has just been stated ; for, as this agent exercises a poAVcrful sedath’e action on the heart, sudden and perhaps fatal syncope may ensue from putting the patient into the erect position. Hence, also, it is dangerous to administer it in those operations that require to be performed Axffiilst the patient is erect. It is weU to caution the patient not to take anything to eat for three or foim hours before its administration, lest it induce vomiting of the partially digested meal. With due caution, it may be given with perfect safety to individuals of all ages. I have operated on infants less than a Aveek old, as AA^ell as on octo- genarians, under its iiffiuence. In administering it to young children. Snow recommends its dilution Avith rectified spirit, but this is unnecessary. The first influence of chloroform appears to be exercised upon the neiwous system. The patient becomes excited and talkative, and a state of uncon- sciousness is induced, the muscular system at the same time being rendered rigid and tense. At this time the heart’s action is usually quickened, and more forcible than natural. As the administration of the chloroform continues, hoAveAer, complete paralysis of sensation and motion is induced. The patient becomes altogether unconscious to all external impressions, the muscles become relaxed, and the action of the heart sIoaa’’ and feeble. This diminution in the power of the heart’s action is well marked in the lessened force of the jet of blood from cut arteries. The respirations become shalloAV and feeble, in pro- portion as the sensibility of the nervous system and the energy of the muscular movements are lessened, and the blood in the arteries becomes dark ; in fact, a semi-asphyxial state sets in. When thus fully anarsthetised, the patient is undoubtedly on the very verge of death, and requires the most careful Avatchiuo- by the person Avho administers the chloroform ; his fingers should iieA'er bo off the pulse, nor his eyes taken aAvay from the countenance of the patient. The Jreathmg should be very carefully observed : when it becomes cmbaiTassedGENERAL RE2IARKS ON OPERATIONS. 20 chlorofoiin must be given sparingly, and when it beeomes stertorous it should be discontinued entirely. In this state, the inhalation of a small additional quantity of this potent agent, the application of the vapour in too concentrated a state, or the sudden raising up of the patient, might occasion death from paralysis of the heart. If the inhalation of chloroform have been suspended, great care should be taken when its administration is recommenced, lest the already enfeebled heart be entirely overpowered by the influence of too large a volume of vapour suddenly given in a concentrated form. It should be borne in mind tliat it is not necessary in all operations to administer chloroform to the same extent. In all the greater operations, as amputations, lithotomy, and the hgatime of arteries, enough should be given to completely paralyse muscular movement, as well as to suspend seusibihty and consciousness. In operations for hernia, also, and aU other proceedings implicating the abdominal walls, if complete muscular relaxation be not induced, great inconvenience and not a httle danger may result. So, also, in very painfid operations about the anus and genital organs, a full dose of chloroform should be given. But for the removal of many tumours about the trunk, or in many of the minor operations on the extremities and about the head and face, mhscular relaxation is not so necessary ; and it udU be snffi- cient to give enough chloroform merely to suspend seusibihty and consciousness to pain. In certain diseased conditions of the system the administration of chloroform requires much care ; but, as a general rule, it may be stated that, whenever the constitutional disease has not advanced to such a degree as to contraindicate an operation, chloroform may be given. In the early stages of phtliisis it may usually be safely inhaled ; but in some cases of bronchial iiritation, the vapoim is apt to produce troublesome cough. When the heart is diseased, great caution is necessary, more particularly Avhen its muscular substance has undergone fatty degeneration ; the sedatnu mfluence of the chloroform being apt, in these circumstances, to produce a sudden depression or airest of the heart’s action. In many, perhaps the majority, of the cases of death from chloroform, the fatal event has been traced to this cause. In valvular disease of the heart, I believe that it may be more safely given. In persons who are epileptic, and in those who suffer from congestion of the brain, it requires to be cautiously adminis- tered, as in the early stages of anaesthesia much cerebral excitement is apt to be evinced. In hysterical subjects, chloroform is said to induce a tendency to laryngeal spasm. The most dangerous condition in uhich to administer ■chloroform is that in Avhich, in consequence of renal disease, the blood is loaded Avith urea ; in such cases epileptiform couAudsions are readily induced, with hvidity of the face, and a tendency to stertor and coma. Should chloroform, or any anassthetic, be given in operations rendered neees- sary by severe injiu’ies, duriny the period of the continuance of the shock of the accident, as in primary amputations ? In such circumstances, its use has been objected to on the ground that it would act injuriously by still further loA\er- ing the already depressed vital powers ; and that the paiir ol the operation, if performed Avithout it, Avould prove a good stimulant, and thus serve to rouse the patient. But Avould this really be so ? Is the pain of an operation a21 SECOXDAllY EFFECTS OF CHLOROFORM. stimulant ? In order to answer this question, let ns observe the condition ot a patient immediately after the performance of a severe operation as an amputation—^vithont his having been amesthetised ; and we shall find that, so far from having been restored or stimulated, he mil have been seriously depressed by it. The pulse will be small, feeble, and slow ; the_ s^face cold ; and the mind, perhaps, scarcely conscious : in fact, though a slight degree o pain, as a pinch or a prick, may act as a stimulant, very severe suffering is a most powerfrd depressing agent, capable in itself of destroying hfe._ ihe pain of an operation performed soon after the occurrence of a severe injuiy, so ^ ai fr-om ronsincr the patient, appears to me to act most injuriously, by infiicting a second shock upon the system before, perhaps, it has fairly recovered from the depressing effects of the fii-st; and it is by preventing this that chlorofonn is of such inestimable advantage. In these cases, it is not necessary to gn e chloroform to an extreme degvee of anaesthetisation. It is only requisite to give it to a moderate extent, chiefly so as to benumb sensation dining the incisions made through the skin. After this, and during the later stages of the operation, the inhalation may be suspended entirely, or nearly so. It is an interesting physiological fact, that the physical effect of shock is produced on the system even though the patient be completely anaesthetised. This is particularly noticeable in cases of castration in which, at the moment when the cord is cut, the pulse wiU be found to fall several beats or to stop momen- tarily, even though the patient be quite insensible. Hence, it may be argued that, although anaesthesia saves the patient that amount of shock which arises from pain, it does not relieve him of that which results from the physical impression produced on the system by a severe mutilation. Secondary Effects of Chloroform may develope themselves in connection ■with the head, the lungs, or the stomach. The liability to inconvenient secondary effects depends chiefly on two conditions : 1, on the mode of administration of the chloroform, especially on the care taken that there is an adequate supply of air admitted at the time Avhen the vapoiu is inhaled ; and 2, on the state of the patient as to age, habit, temperament, and digestion. Old people, habitual spirit-drinkers, and those of a bihous and sanguine temperament, are apt to suffer most. The condition of the digestion is of great importance. If chloro- form be given too soon after a meal, injurious results are sure to follow; hence, it is best administered on an empty stomach. Head-Complications chiefly follow the administration of chlorofoim in the aged. In them headaches and stupor not unfrequently supervene, and occa- sionally paralytic or apoplectic symptoms will develope themselves some days after the anesthesia. In young and nervous women hysterical symptoms often appear, and continue for some hours or even days ; but they need not excite uneasiness. The Inings probably always become slightly congested diu’ing the adminis- tration of chloroform. But, as recovery takes place, and the respiratory process is naturally re-established, the pulmonary vessels unload themselves, and no inconvenienee results. The process is greatly facilitated, and the effects of chloroform are readily got rid of, by desiring the patient to breathe several times fully and deeply after consciousness returns. In some cases the lungs do not unload themselves of the accumulated blood ; and a processGENERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. 22 ot blow asphyxia or a low iorni of pneumonia may set in, and may prove fatal m a period varying from twenty-four hours to four or six days. This is cspeeiaUy apt to happen m those cases in which it becomes necessaxy to bandage the chest, or ill which deep respiration is attended by pain, as after ampiitation of the breast. Great care must, therefore, be employed not to adopt too much constriction of the chest-walls after such operations. IrritaUlity of the Stomach, attended by continual nausea and vomiting, is sometimes a very distressing after-effect of chloroform, and may be pro- ductive of most serious and even of fatal results. In many instances it fs developed by the patient taking the chloroform too soon after a meal, and is then purely gastric. In other instances it aixpears to be sympathetic with cerebral disturbance of some kind ; in other instances, again, it is connected with kidney-disease. But in any case, and fi’om whatever cause arismg, it is a very serious symptom, and, if it continue, often tiums the scale against the patient by the exhaustion to which it gives rise. It is best treated by ice and opium. Death from Chloroform may occur in three different ways ; viz., by Coma, by Asphyxia, or by Syncope; thi-ough the brain, the Imigs, or the heart. When death occm’s by Coma, the patient is heard suddenly to breathe ster- torously; he becomes liAud in the face, and is commlsed; the heart beats until the last moment of life, and death appears to result primarily from the circulation of dark blood through the nervous centres. This form of death chiefly occm’s in individuals who are epilejxtics, or whose blood is loaded with urea. Death by Asphyxia may be produced in one of two ways. 1. It may be the fault of the administratoi’, sufficient air npt being admitted xvith the chloroform-vapour to maintain the respiratory function. This is especially apt to happen when a patient, being semi-narcotised, has a piece of lint saturated with chloroform suddenly apixlied to the mouth and ixose, the heat of the operator’s hand and of the patient’s body rapidly raising a large volume of vapoiu’. 2. Lister describes the production of asphyxia as being due to spasmodic closure of the upper opening of the larynx, the folds of mucous membrane above the apices of the arytaenoid cartilages being carried forwards till they are in contact "with the base of the ej)iglottis, which remains erect and unchanged in position. This theory -was fomided on observations of the larynx dining the production of that peculiar laryngeal stertor which usnaUj^ precedes the stoppage of the respiration. On iDulling the tongue forcibly for- ward, the arytaenoid cartilages ivere seen to be drami backward, and the opening of the larynx made perfectly free again ; and this seemed to be due to reflex action and not to mechanical causes. This is quite possible dining anaesthesia, as the reflex functions of deglutition and respiration ai’e not affected by chloroform as administered for a surgical operation. This state of things may often pass unnoticed till the pulse stops, as the healing of the chest may go on for some time after air has ceased to enter ; the only signs of the state of the patient being the gradually increasing liiidity of the face, and the fact that no air is entering or coming out during respiration, which can be ascertained by feeling with the hand oi'er the mouth. Lister is of opinion that many of the deaths from chloroform, in ivhich the heart has been said to stop first, were cases of this kind.23 ETHER AND CHLOROFORAL In death from Cardiac Sijncojic, the patient, after a few inspirations, sud- denly becomes pale and faint ; the pulse beats in a flickering manner a tew times and then ceases, though respiration may continue : the fatal event being evidently duo to pai-alysis of the heart. This is an accident that may occui’ to individuals who ai-e depressed either by mental emotion or by physical debility before taking the chloroform; and it is not mifrequeiitly connected with, a fatty heart. It is best guarded against by giving the patient a little stimulant, as brandy or ammonia, before commencing the inhalation. Lister’s rules for the administration of chloroform are, to watch the respira- tion in preference to the pulse ; to cease administration at once when the peculiar laryngeal stertor is produced ; and if this pass on to complete obstiuc- tion of respiration, to pull the tongue forcibly forwards so as to cause retraction of the arytamoid cartilages by reflex action, and not merely to bring the tip just in front of the teeth as is usually done, under the impression that the obstruction is due to the faUiiig back of the tongue. The Administration of Ether is effected by the application over the mouth and nostrils of a hollow sponge saturated with the best washed sulphinic ethei. This mode is preferable to the use of any of the complicated inhalers ; inas- much as, by the admixtiu'e in the sponge of a sufiicient quantity of atmospheric ah* ivith the ethereal vapoin*, all danger of asphyxia is avoided. To prevent the pungent effects of ether on the cutaneous siu’face, Warren has pro- posed the anointing of the face ivith some protective imguent. The first effects of the inhalation are resistance on the part of the patient, and some slight irritation of the air-passages ; the pulse is increased in rapidity, rising to a himdred or more; the face becomes flushed, and the movements and speech of the patient excited. This stage of excitement soon passes, and fifll etherisation is then effected ; the pulse falls to sixty or se's’eiity, the countenance becomes pale, insensibility to pain is produced, and the whole muscular system is relaxed. The indications of this state are the dropping of the upper eyelid, and the inability of the patient to sustain liis arm when raised. This is the period most favourable to the performance of operations, and especially for the reduction of dislocations and of fractiu’es attended nith shortening of the limb. The time required for the induction of the antesthetic state Anries; averaging, perhaps, about five minutes, a longer period than is required in the administration of chloroform, and it is attended Avith more excitement. The same precautions that ha\'e been described as being necessary'' dm-ing the administration of chlorofonn, must be attended to AA'hen ether is given. The direct and immediate effects of ether appear to be exercised more on the nervous and respiratory systems and less on tlie heart than of those of chloroform. There are often much dehrimn, bronchial irritation, and laryngeal spasm during its administration; and the bronchial irritation may dcA’clope into a serious and persistent after-effect. But ether does not appear to act, as chloroform undoubtedly sometimes does, as a direct sedatiA'e to the heart’s action. Comparison betAveen Ether and Chloroform.—The history of Anaesthetics fiu*nishes an additional illustration of the mutability of professional opinion. Ether Avas almost the only anassthetic used for tlie first year after the discoA'ery24 GEN Eli AL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. of its use as an amnstlietic. It then rapidly gave vay to chloroform ; and so conipletely was this agent substituted for ether in this country and generally loughont Europe, that a coufusion arose in the public mind as to the real discoi-erer of Antesthesia, and Sir James Simpson, who was one of the first to employ chloroform and to ivhosc energy its general adoption was mainly due, Avas A'ery conunonly considered to be the discoverer of Amesthetics. In- some hospitals, howcA'er, and more especially in those of Boston, the birth- place of surgical Anaesthesia, the faith in Ether has ueA’er been shaken, nor its use abandoned for that of any other agent. In this country a change of pro- fessional opinion has to some extent set in, and strenuous efforts have been made since the death of the illustrious discoverer of the anesthetic properties of chloioform to decry that agent, arid to re-introduce ether' as a general anesthetic. That ether and chloroform are equally effecthe in the production of Anes- thesia, is undoubted. But the adA'ocates of the first allege that it is the safer agent of the tAvo ; whilst those of the latter assert that, admitting the greater■ safety of ether, it is equally certain that it is less convenient and less generally applicable as an Anmsthetic. This question, then, has to be examined from three aspects ;—1. As to the apiAhcability ; 2. As to the convenience ; and 3. As to the safety of the tivo Anesthetics. 1. As to AiJijlicabiiity.—There can be no doubt that in the A'ast majority of cases both are equally applicable. But there are certain cases in which ether and others in which chloroform ajApear to possess superior adA'antages. Ether is preferable in those cases in Avhich from severe shock the nerA’Ous powers are greatly depressed, and in those in AA’hich there is atony of the heart, whether fr’om fatty degeneration or from an enfeebled and dilated state of the ventricles. Chloroform appears to be more applicable in all those cases in Avhich it is necessary to maintain the anmsthcsia for a great length of time—for many hours—as in the compression of an arteiy in the treatment of anemism, and- in aU those cases in which the galA'anic cautery is used in the neighboinhood of the mouth or air-passages; the Anpoin of ether under these circumstances being liable to ignite Avith explosiA'e violence, as I haA'e seen happen. 2. As to Convenience.—In this respect, chloroform luidoubtedly possesses a A'ast superiority OA'er ether, and indeed it Avas its superiority in this respect that led so rapidly to its substitution for that agent. Snow formerly compared the two agents to a lucifer-match and a tinder-box respectively, and also to an express and a slow train, in which Ave regard convenience rather than safety. Chloroform is infinitely more convenient than ether in many Avays. By it the aneesthesia is more rapidly induced, with less struggling and mental excitement. When once induced, it is more easily maintained complete and' imbrokcn. The quantity required to produce anesthesia is far smaller. This is a most important adA'antage in midwifery and in military and naval prac- tice, Avhcre the larger bulk of the ether that is cousiuned in inducing anesthesia Avould often render its employment A'cry difficult. So also iu ordinary country practice, where Surgeons have to Avork single-handed or Avith imperfect assist- ance, the readiness Avitli Avhich anesthesia is induced by chloroform, and the25 NITROUS OXIDE GAS. absence of violent excitement, is a very important consideration in its fa^om. The penetratimr and long peraistent odour of ether, though of minor import, is not without its disad\-antage to many who are delicate or susceptible. .S. As to Safety.—^0 amesthctic is absolutely safe. It is impossible to annihilate, even temporarily, mental consciousness and physical sensibility mth- oiit some risk. With ordinary care and some degree of experience, this risk is capable of being reduced to very trifling proportions. So small is the risk that many a Surgeon goes through a lengthened hospital experience without meeting iidth a fatal case. But, slight as is the danger from the administration of aiiEesthetics bv competent persons, there is still luidoubtedly a certain deh- nite peril attendant on their use. That this is somewhat greater when chloroform is used than when ether is employed is probable—how much gi-eater is uncertain. There are no data before the profession from which a compara- tive estimate of the relative danger of these tivo agents can be dra^ni. That many fatal accidents have occiuTed from the administration of chloro- foim diu’ing the twenty-five years in which it was almost the exclusive amesthetic used ill this country, is unfortiuiately too true. How many of these were ineHtable—due to causes beyond the control of the administrator and solely referable to the toxic action of the amesthetic—is uncertain. That but few fatal accidents have as yet followed the administration of ether is certain. How far this is due to this ansesthetic being actually safer—ie., less toxic than chloroform—is uncertain ; and the comparison is at present scarcely just. For, since the re-introduction of ether into practice, it has chiefly been employed by professed and experienced amesthetisers, and much greater skill in the management of aiiEesthetics has been acquired by the profession than could or did exist in the earlier days of the practice. In conclusion, I would say that, with reasonable care and in fairly skilled hands, both chloroform and ether are agents that may safely be administered in the vast majority of cases requiring siu’gical operations: that in most cases they are equally applicable: that in some chloroform, in others ether, is the preferable agent: that in midwifery, mihtary, naval, and single-handed coimtry practice, chloroform, being far less bulky, more portable, and more easy of administration, is preferable to ether; but that, so far as we can at present judge, ether less frequently than chloroform produces a direct toxic infliience on the heart, and is consequently so far the safer agent of the- two. Nitrous Oxide Gas was the first antesthetic used. Its employment was,. lidwcN'er, soon discontinued, ether, and subsequently chloroform, taking its place. It was, howcA'er, re-introduced a few years ago as an anassthetic by the American dentists. It is an admirable antesthetic, capable of producing com- plete insensibility; rapid in its action ; safe in administration, and seldom gi\ iug rise to any impleasant after-effects. It has, however, one drawback which prevents its applicability to prolonged operations. The class of cases to' Avhich the nitrous oxide is applicable as an anaesthetic is restricted, owing to- the shortness of the duration of the anaesthesia produced by it, and the sud- den ness and completeness of the return to consciousness, leaving the after- smart of the operation almost as severely felt as the sting of the cut itself coiild have been. Nitrous oxide is chiefly of use in operations iTuattended by26 GENERAL REALARKE ON OPERATIONS. as in the forcible flexiu-c of stiffened joints, the av ulsion of toe-nails, ex lac ion o teeth, &c. ; or in those cutting operations which are completed j a single strake of the scalpel or bistoury, as the opening of an abscess or the division of a fistula. Nitrous Oxide aud Ether.—As has already been stated, each of these agents popcsses certain disadvantages—the auaisthesia jiroduced by nitrous oxide not being sufficiently persistent to admit of the performance of prolonged opera- tions, that of ether being slow of production and often attended by a species of delirious excitement. By the successive administration of the two ames- thetics, these uiconveiiiences are removed, aud the advantages of the two secured. ^ The plan adopted by Clover consists hi the rapid induction of .anassthesia by the nitrous oxide, and the maintenance of this hisensibility by the use of the vapoiu- of ether. In this way one anesthetic supplements the ■othei, and the safety of the one is combined with the persistence of the ■other. Bichloride of Methylene, originally suggested as an anesthetic by Dr. Bichardson, has lately been extensively used, especially at Guy’s Hospital and at the Moorfields Ophthahmc Hospital. Its adi'antagcs over chloroform are said to be greater rapidity of action, complete and rapid recovery, and the absence of muscular rigidity during administration, and of unpleasant after- symptoms. ^ Over nitrous oxide it has the advantage, that the amesthesia can be maintained for any length of time. Though said to be safer than chloro- form, its use is not perfectly free from danger, more than one fatal case having afready occiUTcd ; aud if used for operations lasting more than two minutes, it seems quite as liable to cause ’vomiting. , To produce rapid ansesthesia, it is necessary that the vapour be inhaled in as concentrated a state as possible, all luinecessary admission of air being avoided. For this piupose an apparatus has been devised by Mr. Eendle of Guy’s Hospital, consisting of a leather ■cylinder, open at one end and shaped so as to fit closely over the mouth and nose, the other end being dome-shaped and perforated so as to admit sufficient air for respiration. In the interior of this cylinder is a loosely fitting flannel bag, which overlaps the open end and is secured by an elastic band. The administration is performed as follows. One drachm of the bichloride of methylene is spruikled on the mside of the flannel bag, and the leather cylinder is immediately placed over the face of the patient ; at first it must not fit accurately to the nose and mouth, but, as soon as the patient can bear it, it must be pressed firmly down so as to exclude all air, except such as passes through the bag. By these means anassthesia sufficient for opening an abscess is, usually produced under one minute, passing off" as rapidly as it Avas induced. If the administration be prolonged xmtil the drachm of the bichloride is com- qiletely exlxausted, the amesthesia usually lasts about fix'e minutes ; the patient on recoA’cring being able to AvaUv away Axith only a slight feeling of giddiness. If necessary, a second drachm may be used to prolong the effect ; but the after- S3mptoms then resemble those of chloroform, though iu a someAvhat minor ■degree. The signs of danger during administration are liA'idity of the face, •and cessation of the pulse and respiration. If they occur, it is best, according to Dr. Bader’s adA’ice, to ]fiace the patient at once iu the reemnbeut position on the left side, AA'ith the tongue Avell pulled forward, Avhen the symptoms Avill27 LOCAL AXyESTlIESIA. oTacIually pass off. Dr. Richardson has concluded from experiments on animals, that in fetal cases respiration and the heart’s action cease at the same time. In hospital practice, where time is of considerable impoidance, it has been found to be a eonvenient plan to induce amesthesia m the fu-st instance by means of bichloride of methylene, and to maintain it afterwards as long as may be necessary by chloroform. 4.,, The Treatment of the Effects arising from an Overdose of Ansesthetics is conducted on two principles 1, the establishment of respiration either natural or ai-tificial, so as to empty the lungs of the A'apom contained in the afr-cells,and to aid the oxygenation of the blood; and 2, the stmuilation of the heart’s action, and the maintenance of the circulation. The first principle of treatment—that of re-establishing respiration—is mosc serviceable in the asphyxial fonn ; the other—that of stimulating the heart— when the syncopal symptoms are present. But in all cases they may most advantageously be employed in combination. The treatment to be adopted on the occmTence of dangerous symptoms, or of aiipai-ent death from chloroform, is as follows. 1. The administration of the vapour must be at once discontinued. 2. The tongue should be seized with the fingers, or inth a hook or forceps, and drawn out of the mouth ; and the larynx pushed up so that the glottis may be opened. 3. Fresh air should be admitted to the patient by opening doors and windows, and by preventing bystanders or spectators from crowding round. 4. All constrictions should be removed fr’om the patient’s thi’oat and chest, and these parts should be freely exposed. 5. Artificial respiration must at once and without delay be set up, whilst these other measures are being canied out, either by the Siu’geon applying his mouth to the patient’s lips, and thus breathing into the chest; or, what is preferable, by the alternate and steady compression and relaxation of the walls of the patient’s chest. 6. Electricity may be applied fr’eely over the heart and diaphragm through to the spine, by means of the electro-magnetic or other convenient apparatus. 7. As aceessory means, friction of the extremities may be employed ; a little brandy rubbed inside the mouth ; and cold water dashed on the face. The nitrite of amyl would appear, from the experiments of Dabney on animals and from recent observations on man, to be an antidote to chloroform-poisoning, both in its syncopal and asphyxial forms ; the inspiration of the vapoiu’ of ten to fifteen drops of the nitrite miloading the vessels and restoring the heart’s action. Local Anaesthesia may be induced by freezing a part. This is done in two ways : 1, by the application of a freezing mixture ; 2, by the rapid evaporation of very pure ether. The application of a frigorific mixture of ice and snow, as introduced by Dr. J. Amott, may A’ery conveniently be employed in many cases in which the internal administration of anaisthetics is either inadmissible or inconvenient. It can only be produced with certainty, however, in those cases in which the incisions merely implicate the skin and subcutaneous structures, as in opening abscesses, slitting up sinuses, awdsion of toe-nails, orGENERAL REMARKS ON' OPERATIONS. 28 removing small and superficial tumours, extremely valuable. For all such purposes, however, it is he mode of using t]\c frigorific mixture is as follov's. About a tumblerful of rough ice is put into a strong canvas bag, and finely powdered with a mallet. It is then poured out on a sheet of paper, and half its bulk of salt is ciuickly mixed with it by means of an ivory or wooden paper-knife. The mixture is. then put into a muslin or gauze bag, suspended from a wooden ring, and applied to the part for from five to ten minutes. So soon as the skin becomes Avhite, opaque, and hard, anesthesia is produeed, and the incisions may be made- Avithout any pain being experienced. The frozen part speedily recovers itself no inconA'enience resultimr. ’ The rapid evaporation of higlilg rectified ether has been A'ery ingeniously and successfully applied by Dr. Eichardson in the production of cold sufficient to fr-eeze a part, and thus render it temporarily insensible. A fine spray-jet of ether of a low specific gravity is throAra upon the part to be amesthetised. The skin rapidly becomes Avhite and hard—is, in fact, fr’ozen. This method of iiidncing local insensibility to pain is more exact and efficacious than that by the fr-igorific mixtime, and is generally preferred. It is applicable in the same class of cases. PERFORMANCE OF AN OPERATION. The Incisions for the operation itself should be carefully and properly planned, so as to giA'e sufficient space with as little mutilation as jiossible; and in some cases they must be aiTanged with the Aiew of subsec|uent extension, should the state of things be discoA'ered to require it. They should be made freely, AAuthout tailing ■ the ^Aoint of the knife being entered and withdraAAOi perpendicularly, and made to cut Avith a rapid saving motion, due attention being at the same time paid to the resistance of the tissues,, so that the Surgeon may not, by using too much force, plunge or jerk his scalpel or bistomy into the part. The scalpel should be set on a smooth ebony handle, aaEIcIi is less sb’iqAery than an iA’ory one when Avetted Avith blood, and admits greater delicacy of touch ; it should be light in the blade, nearly straight-backed, and slightly bellied on the cutting edge. When very free and extensive incisions are required, as in the removal of large tumours, &c., Liston’s spring-backed bistoury, of proper size and shape, is a most convenient instrument. Whilst the incisions are being made, care must be taken that too much blood is not lost. This may be prevented most conveniently by the- use of the tourniquet, or by an assistant compressing the main artery of the- limb. Many operations may be rendered comparatively bloodless by raising the part or limb before the artery is comj)re8sed or a tomniquet is applied, so as to empty the A'essels of their contents. If the seat of the ojDeration be such as not to admit of this, the assistant must compress the bleeding vessels, as- they are divided during the operation ; and as soon as it is concluded he must remoA'e his fingers fr’om them, one by one, to admit of their being ligatured, or twisted. Bloodless Methods.—Various devices have been employed for many yearn past to diminish the loss of blood. The oldest of these is bandaging the lim)A firmly to the Ica'cI at AAEich the tomniquet is applied, before tightening the29 ESMAKCU'S METHOD. wthonfc a pad. A piece of card slioidd be inserted beneath the screw of the tourniquet to save the skin from being pinched. The most perfect n^ethod, however, that has yet been invented, is that of Esmarch, of Kiel, which is tPus caiTied out. An elastic bandage is applied spirally from the lower extremity of the hmb upwards to the point at which the tourniquet is to be put on.^ ihe toiu’iiiquet consists of a stout piece of India-i’ubbei tubing about 4 in. in diameter and 2 ft. in length, having a hook fixed to one end and an eye to the other. This is stretched and wound firmly round the limb two or three times. It often happens that the hook does not meet the eye exactly as it is wanted to, so that either an extra tium of the tube must be put roimd the limb, or the former tons imduly relaxed. This may be obviated by replacing the hook and eye by two pieces of stout tape bound on to the end of the India-rubber tube. The tube can then be apphed with exactly the amount of force required, and seciu-ed by tying the two pieces of tape together. On removing the elastic bandage fi’om below the tommiquet, the limb will be found to be absolutely bloodless, even the bones very frequently yielding no blood on being cut. With the exception of the elasticity of the skin and the retraction of the muscles, the operation exactly resembles one on a dead body. In this state, all vessels of any size can be seen and tied before the tourniquet is removed. On removing the tourniquet, when the blood retimis to the wounded part, very free oozing will set in, which often takes some time to arrest by means of cold and exposure to the air. Thus it may happen that the patient loses as much blood as if Esmarch’s method had not been employed. Various objections have been raised to Esmarch’s bloodless method. It has been stated that it causes sloughing of the flaps and increases the tendency to secondary ha3morrhage ;after large amputations, by umiatiually augmenting the proportion of blood in the body, and so giving rise to increased arterial tension. Neither of these statements is supported by experience. A more rational objection against it is that when the limb is infiltrated with the products of inflammation, or when perhaps clots exist in the veins, these may be driven on into the circulation by the application of the elastic bandage. Although no case of such an accident Fig. 3.—Esinaroli’s Jletliod.GENERAL REAL ARKS ON OPERATIONS. n '’f “"dittons oxist to empty the lesciibocl. riio same plan is also better employed in cases of cancer or sarcoma, m which the danger of dislodging- particles and driving them ito the cncnlation would be very considerable. It must be remembered n applying the India-rnbber band that enormous pressm-e is easily obtained by a few turns one over the other, so much so, that in situations in ivhich the chief nerves lie very close to the bones, as in the aim, symptoms of paralysis lasting some weeks are recorded by Langenbeck as ha^n’iig resulted from its use. The advantages of the bloodless method in operations on diseased bones and joints and in the removal of tumours are even greater than in amputations. Whatever form of tourniquet is employed, it is to be taken off as soon as all the vessels which can be- seen have been tied ; the assistant, however, if oozing continue after all jetting vessels have been tied, may arrest it by exposure to the air, or by poming a stream of cold water upon the woimd. In some cases the pressure of a pad and bandage, and in others that of a sand- bag, unll arrest this bleeding ; but in the ma- jority of instances the position and coaptation of the flaps ivill sulflce. The Sutures, if any are needed, should be introduced at the time of the operation, whilst the patient is still imder chlorofoim. If the wound be dressed at once they are tied in the usual way, and the edges thus brought neatly together. If the dressing of the wound be deferred for a few hoins, they should be left to hang loose, and not be di-aivn tight until the wound is dressed. In this ivay the patient Fia. 4.-Lister’.s jiethod. is savcd the pain, which is always much com- plained of, of introducing the sutines at the time of the dressing. They are generally best made of dentist’s tudst, of moderate thickness, so as not to cut out readily. Silver or unoxydisable iron wire forms an excellent material for sutures in the plastic operations, and in many other cases in Avhich the silk thread is apt to in-itate. In some cases, Avhcre much tension is exercised, or great accm-acy required, hare-lip j)ins are jncferable to ordinary sutines. Dressing of the Wound.—There is a local as ivell as a constitutional hygiene. For the proper healing of a ivound it is not enough that the general sanitary conditions of the patient be scrupulously attended to. There is a hygiene of the ivound as Avell as of the body that requires scrupulous care. If this be neglected, not only ivill the healing of the wound be retarded, but theDRESSING OF THE WOU^'E. 3T licalth of the body and the life of the patient will be endangered by con- tamination from a fold sore or a fetid abscess half filled with putrescent pus and swarming with filth-begotten organisms. This local or wound-hygiene consists in the prevention of the retention, and consequent decomposition of discharge, whether of blood, serum, or pus, by the use of drainage, frequent ablutions, or injections with antiseptic washes, and protection from the air. The dressing of an operation-wound presents- nothing peculiar, or that in any way differs from what is adopted in ordinaiy incised\ounds. As a general rule, the wound should bo dressed before the patient leaves the table ; should there be any reasons for departing from this^ the plan that was recommended by Liston, and which was invariably adopted in former years at XJnivei’sity College Hospital, is a very excellent one, nz., to leave the ivound open with a piece of wet lint interposed between its lips, for two or thi-ee hoims, imtil its siu’faces have become glazed ; the lint is then care- fully removed, any small coagula are gently taken aAvay, and the sides of the incision brought into apposition, the sutures being drawn tight and tied. Long- strips of plaster of moderate width should now be applied ; these may be either- of the isinglass or the common adhesive kind, each having advantages that i*econmiend" it in particular cases, -with corresponding disadvantages that exclude it in others. The isinglass plaster is clean, uniiTitating, and, being- transparent, allows a good view of subjacent parts ; but it has the disadvantage of loosening and stripping off when moistened by the discharges or dressings, which often renders it a very inefficient support. The conxmon adhesive plaster is more in-itating and dirty, but it is much stronger, and holds more tightly, not loosening so readily when moistened. Should the Surgeon prefer “ anti- septic ” efressings, he must employ them in accordance with the rules laid do-uui in the Chapter on the Treatment of Wounds. But in any case he must not omit, especially if the operation wound be deep and extensive, to use a “ drain- age-tube,” in order to prevent the retention in it of the serous fluid that oozes from the cut sm-faces, and the retention of which in the wound is in many ways most in jurious. In some cases, in which the woimd is in such a situation as to admit of it, and more particularly if it be a deep though clean cut—as after the extii-pation of a tumom-—gveat advantage "will be found, after the sutures ha-\'e been introduced and the plasters applied, in padding the part externally vith a firm compress of dry hnt, and then applying a roller tightly but evenly over all, so sis to compress the sides against the bottom of the wound an^ the edges firmly one against the other. In this way will not only all oozing be prevented, but direct coalescence and union of the opposed surfaces may be secured. This dry compress may be left undisturbed for forty-eight hours, when it should ]jc removed and another applied, or, if it appear more desiraljle, the part covered -with water-dressing. The of the part should be carefully attended to, so that the edges and surfaces of the incision be brought into proper contact; more maybe done in this way, without pain or uneasiness to the patient, than by any amount of ti-action and pressure that can be exercised. The part should be so arranged that one end of the incision may be the more dependent, so as to facilitate the escape of discharges. One end of each ligature should be cut oft' short, the other being left of a moderate length to hang out of the loAvcst part of the3- GENERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. wound, provided that the thread do not lie aloin? its whole line. A nan-ow .strip ol water-dressing should then be applied along the edge of the incision ihefu-st dressings need not be changed until about the third day after the ■operation, unless they become loose or have been too tightly applied, when they may be snijiped across. If the sutimes do not interfere uith the <3scape of the discharges, and do not produce undue in-itation or excessive traction, they may be left in for a few days longer. In amputations, especially ill cachectic subjects, they may frequently be left undisturbed for six or ei<^ht ■days, with much advantage, ' “ If union do not take place by adhesive mflammation, and suppuration have commenced, with much tension and heat about the part, the substitution of a poultice for the water-di-essing be advantageous. When suppm-ation has fairly set in, the appheations should be changed at least twice or thrice in the twenty-four hoiu’S, and the woiuid may with advantage be washed out twice a<lay with injections of carbolised water. The neglect of this precaution often giies lise to much iiritation, and retards the healing process by the accumula- tion of discharges in and around the wound. Care shoidd also be taken that there is a free escape for the pus, which may sometimes be pent up by the too uarly cohesion of the edges, without a coiTesponding agglutination of the deeper .surfaces of the wound. As granidations siting up, it may become necessary to substitute astringent dressings for the emollient ones ; and the parts must be weU supported by bandages, especially hi amputations, and in all cases where there is a tendency to bagging of matter. The Constitutional After-treatment of operations demands as much •attention on the part of the Surgeon as the management of the wound itself. Immediately after the operation, and before the effects of the amesthetic have passed off, the patient should be comfortably arranged in bed, with the clothes supported by a cradle, or other contrivance, away from the part implicated, an opiate should then be administered, or a little vine and water if there be faintness, and the patient kept as quiet as possible. With regard to the Diet after the oim-ation, this must depend entirely on the patient’s constitutional powers, his previous habits, his age, and upon the severity of the operation. But, as a general rule, it may be stated that, as an operation is a shock to the system, the constitutional powers require to be maintained after its performance. This is more particidarly the case, if the mutilation be severe, or the subsequent suppmation abundant. If the patient’s strength be good, not having been broken by previous disease or suffering, and if the operation be a slight one, as the amputation of a finger, or the removal of a small tumour, he may have half his usual diet allowed for a few days, but >vith little, if any, stimulants. If the operation have been more severe, but not capital, no solids shoidd be allowed, but broths and noiuishing liquids alone given for the first few days. If the operation have been a capital one, the patient’s health and strength being otherwise good, he may be restricted to fm-inaceous slops and beef-tea until suppuration has come on ; indeed, up to this time, the febrile reaction will usually prevent the patient from taking solids. Some light pudding may then be added ; and the diet may, as the case progi’esses, be gradually improved by the successive addition of fish and the lighter kinds of meat, ivith a moderate quantity of stimulants, as required,.33 DIET AFTER THE OFERATIOH. until it reach the normal standard. It not nnfi-cquently happens however, that a totally different course must be pursued. It is not my intention to enter upon the great question of the use and abuse of alcohol as an article of diet. But as a medicinal agent in severe smgical cases there can be no doubt of the gi-eat utility, indeed the indispensable necessity, of alcohol in some shape. If the patient have been much reduced by long-continued suppuration, or other depressing causes before the operation ; if he be old and weakly in constitution, or have been in the habit of taking a very considerable quantity of stimulants, it mil be absolutely necessary to adopt a tonic and stimulating mode of treatment. Indeed, in hospital practice especially, this is by ‘fm’ the most successful mode of treating patients after severe opeia- tions without it, many would have sunk, whom I have seen saved by the free administration of large quantities of brandy, vdne, porter, eggs, and beef-tea from the very time of the operation ; that stimulant being given to which the patient is accustomed in a state of health. This plan of treatment is also one of the best preventives of those low and diffuse forms of inflammation that are so commonly fatal in these cases ; and when they come on, I know no better remedy than the brandy-and-egg mixtine, freely administered. In all this, however, the Sm'geon must be guided by the patient s pulse, his pre'sdous habits, and the strength of his constitution ; and nothing requires greater iudgment than the administration of stimulants, according to these particulars. The great importance of attendiiig scrupulously to the general cleanliness of the patient, and to the ventilation of the ward or room in which he is lying, as the best means of preventing the occurrence of the lower forms of inflammatory mischief, need scarcely be insisted on, as these hygienic pre- cautions arc universally recognised as being of the first importance mider such circumstances. The remote effect of the major operations is a subject that requires investi- gation. Do people Avho haA'e undergone any of the greater operations, and Avho have recovered from the immediate effects, as a rule, live as long as those Avho have not sustained a mutilation ? I am disposed to think that they do not. When Ave reflect on the enormous number of persons who suffer amputa- tion of one of the limbs from injiuy, under the age of thirty, it is remarkable hoAv seldom one sees an old person in a hospital or elsewhere, who has lost a limb in early life. I am, of coinse, only speaking of amputations for injiuy. Those Avho haA'e undergone this operation for strumous or malignant disease, ngcessarily frequently die eaidy from rccuiTence of the constitutional vice in other parts of the body. So also with respect to lithotomy. Very many boys :arc cut for stone every year and recoA'er, but I scarcely recollect to haA'e ever met Avith a middle-aged adult aa'Iio had been operated on in childhood. The various Special Operations will be considered AA’hen treating of the several Injuries and Diseases for Avhich they are required ; but, as Amputations do not readily fall under any special head, being required for a vast variety of different conditions, it Avill be more convenient to consider them here. VOI,. T. c34 AMPUTATIONS. CHAPTEE II. —»— AMPUTATIONS AND DISARTICULATIONS. The tcnn AmjmtaUon means the separation or removal of a part of the body. It is most commonly applied to the removal of a limb, but sometimes also to that of other parts, as the breast or penis. The fre(juency of amputation of the limbs has much lessened of late years ; other and less se^'ere modes of treatment being now successfully followed in many cases of diseased joint, of aneurism, and of compound fractiu'e. Still amputations are among the most frequent operations in siu’gery, and uiU con- tinue to be so as long as the human body is hable to severe mutilations, to gangrene of the limbs, and to malignant and other incurable diseases of the- bones and joints. It has been somewhat the fashion to decry amputation ; and to speak of this operation as an opprobrium to curative surgery. Biit, though no Surgeon can deprecate mmecessary amputations more strongly than I do, yet I caimot admit that the removal of a limb is an operation of less merit than any other proceeding adopted when all other means have failed in ciu’ing- the diseased part, or in saving the patient’s life finm danger. And, smely, it is rather a subject of just pride than the reverse, for the Siu’geon to be able to- save the whole of the body by sacrificing by a simple operation a limb that has been utterly disorganised or spoilt by disease or injiuy. In the perfoimance of an amputation, also, much dexterity may frequently be displayed ; and there is conunonly gveat scope for surgical skill in the constitutional treatment of the patient both before and after the operation. The amputation of a limb is generally perfoimed through the continuity of a bone ; when done at a joint, it is called a Bisartimlatimi. THE PERFORMANCE OP AN AMPUTATION. In performing an amjmtation there are several distinct steps which must be considered separately. They consist in—1. The prevention of heemorrhage during the operation; 2. The mode of forming the flaps or of cutting' through the soft parts ; 3. Sawing the bone ; 4. The arrest of hasmon’hage after the removal of the limb ; and 5. The dressing of the stiunp. 1. Prevehtioh op H^bmoerhage.—The loss of blood during the operation is the great primary danger which must be careftiUy guarded against. As a general rule, it is better to prevent this by the apj)lication of a tourniquet than by trusting to the compression of the artery by an assistant’s fingers; the toimiiquet arrests the flow of blood through the collateral vessels as well as through the main trunk, whilst the finger can only stop the cmvent of blood that passes thi’ough the latter. When the tom-niquet is applied, the pad should be carefully placed OA'cr the artery, and the baud buckled rather tight but the instnunent should not be screwed up until the moment of the opera- tion. It should then be tightened rapidly, so as to lessen the liability tO' congestion of the lower pai’t of the limb that always occurs when a tourniquetMODES OF AMPUTATING. 35 is applied, but which is especially apt to ensue when the instrument is slowly screwed up. The fimt effect of the tightening of the tourniquet is to compress Fig. 5.—Pressiu’e with Thiimhs. Application of Tourniquet to Femoral Arterj'. the large veins of the limb ; the second, to arrest the flow of blood through the arteries : hence the more slowly it is caused to act, the greater vdll be the venous engorgement of the limb. The blood that flows from the limb during an amputation is almost entirely venous, coming from the lower part of the member. In those cases, as of chronic disease, in which it is of great import- ance to save blood as much as possible, it is a good precaution either to keep the limb raised for a few minutes before the application of the tommiquet, or to bandage it tightly from below upwards immediately before the tourniquet is apphed ; thus not only iireventing aU the venous congestion, but emptying the vessels of their contained blood. When this is done, the tourniquet should be applied ■without a pad. In this Avay the amputation may be rendered almost bloodless, or Esmarch’s method, described at page 29, may be adopted. So soon as the main arteries have been tied after the removal of the hmb, the tourniquet may be unscrewed and taken off"; the assistant, however, keej)ing his finger on the artery aboA’e the stimip, lest any vessels have been left untied, or a ligature slip. If the band be left only half loosened, it will often happen that venous haemon'hage continues abundantly from the stinnp, in consequence of the pressure of the instrament being still sufficient to prevent the retimi of the blood through the \'eins. This will at once cease on taking the tourniquet comjfletely off, and elevating the cut surfaces. 2. Mode of CuTTiifa through the soft farts.—In amputations and dis- articulations, the Surgeon has the choice of four Ojm'ative Procedures: (1) The circiflar method ; (2) the oval method ; (3) flaps of various sizes and shapes ; and (4) a combination of skin-flaps with a circular cut through the muscles. It is not my intention to enter into a discussion as to the relative merits of the circular and flap methods, for which I would refer to the Avritings of Liston36 AirPUTATIONS. and Velpeau. I belie\-e that by either the eircnlar or the flap method an equally good stinnp may nlthnately be formed; but that much will depend upon the speeial dexterity whieh the Surgeon may have acquired by the habitual performance of one or other of these operations. Educated in the doctrines of Liston, who invariably amputated by the flap method, and who certainly did this ndth wonderful rapidity and jDrecision, I have been in the habit of performing this operation in preference to the circular, over which it certainly possesses the special advantages of greater celerity in perfomiance, more perfect coaptation and smoothness of the opposite sides of the wound, and a greater tendency to union of the stump by the first intention. But, though giving the preference as a general rule to the flap amputation, I would not by any means wish it to be understood that I lu’ge its adoption in all cases, or would ^vish to exclude entirely other methods of operating. In iujui'ies, especially, no one method can always be adopted, the Surgeon often being obliged to fashion his stump as best he may in accordance nfith the conditions to which the limb has been reduced by the injury inflicted on it. Many other points have to be considered, such as the best covering for the bones, the best pad for an artificial limb, and the best drainage for the stump during the healing process. But it is interesting to observe how the method of amputating has been materially modified in consequence of the general employment of Anaesthetics. In the pre-autesthetic days, the only means of saving pain was by rapidity of operating. Hence rapidity became an important element in the performance of so severe an operation as an amputation ; and this was secured by the flap method, the process of transfixion and of^ rapid cutting outwards bemg much less painftil than that of a slow cutting iiiwai'ds. But ■pig. G.—Amputation of Ann by the Circulw Method.

Hence many inethod^ ot amputating that wore discarded a quarter of a century ago have regained then- ascendancy, and Surgeons now deliberately carve out flaps by cutting h’oni ivithoiit inwards, regardless of the gi-eater length of time reqmred, provided the result is more satisfactory. . Amputation by the Circular Method.—In this amputation, the slau and tat are fli-st diHdod by a single sweep of the knife and dissected up for a distance equal to half the diameter of the limb ; the muscles are then divided by another circular sweep of the knife and retracted for a distance varying fl’om one to two inches, according to the thickness of the limb ; and the bone is saivn as high up as possible. In the thigh and leg it vas recommended by Hey to cut the posterior muscles longer than the anterior, to allow for their greater contraction. The edges of the skin are brought together in the trans- vei-se diameter of the limb, and a stump is formed with abundant covering for the bones, but necessarily vdth some puckering and projection at each angle. Diu-ing the late Franco-Priissian war, the circular was - the method almost universally adopted by the German sm-geons ; the advantages they claim for it ”•—Amimtatlou of the Ann by the Circular Method.

In some cases of malignant disease, also, when it is desirable not to approach too nearly to the diseased portion of the limb, the circular may be found a safer operation than the flap method, so far as the ultimate condition of the patient is concerned, in lessening the liability to recurrence. The oval method is especially applicable to certain amputations and disarti- culations of the bones of the hand and foot. It presents no advantage in the larger amputations. riap Amputation.—In performing flap amputations by transfixion, the Simgeon should stand so that he may support and grasp the limb to be removed ; the left hand being placed on the outer side in amputations of the left limbs, on the inner side in those of the right. When the flaps are cut from-without inwards and raised by a process of dissection, the Siu’geon wfll find it more convenient to stand on the right-hand side of the limb, so that rig. 8.—Amputation of tlie Tliigli. Autero-posterior Flap Operation. Flaps cut by Transli.'cion. he may take the flaps himself while he leaves the limb to the care of an assistant. He will commence to cut the flap at the side farthest from him. The Amputating Instruments must be in proper order, and of good con- struction. For the smaller amputations the Surgeon ttnll require straight spring-backed bistomles, narroAV or broad in the blade, according to the size of the part to be removed. Scalpels, also, not too broad in the blade, are useful in cases in which the bistoury, from its length, might be inconvenient. Cutting-pliers, with long and strong handles and short blades, either straight or curved, as may be most convenient, are especially required in amputations39 DOUBLE FLAP AMPUTATIONS. ftboufc the hands and feet. The knives for the larger amputations should have smooth ebony handles, and be veil balanced. The back ot the blade should run straight to the point and be well rounded. The edge should taper oil towards the point, with a good convexity. The breadth of the blade should A-ary from | to f of an inch, and its length should be proportioned to the thick- ness of the limb to be remo\-ed. As a general rule, in order to make a good sweeping cut, so as to form a well-rounded and smooth hap, the blade should be in length equal to about double the thickness of the limb. The saiv shonld bo strong in the blade and back, so as not to bend in cutting. The blade must be of good breadth, and, in order not to hang as it works its way through the bone, must be somewhat thicker at the cutting edge than elsewhere. The teeth should not be too fine, and must be set crossivays. The artery-forceps may either be of the ordinary “ bulldog ” make, or may be broad toAvai’ds the point, so as to allow the knot more readily to be slipped over the vessel to be tied. Amputations by fiaps fashioned from the soft parts so as to cover the bone and form a AA'ell-cushioned stump may be performed in several different ways : by double flaps, by one long rounded flap, or by one long and one short square flap. The Double Flap AmpiitaHon is that which is usully practised, and that Avhich we shall fii’st consider. The two flaps may be made either by cutting fr’om without imvards, or by transfixion—cutting from within outwards. I generally prefer transfixion in fleshy parts, as the thigh or arm ; but cutting fr-om Avithout inwards will be found to afford the best result, and is indeed the only mode of forming the flap, in some situations m which the bones are natiu'ally thinly covered, as on the outer side of the fore-arm, the anterior part of the leg, or just above the ankle- joint, or where the soft parts have been AVasted by chronic disease. The flaps should be made by a steady SAA'eeping cut, so that the soft parts may be evenly and smoothly dfrided. Their length must of com'se be proportioned to the thickness of the limb ; and on this point no positive direction can be given, except that care be taken that they be not cut too long nor too short. If they be cut too long, too much muscle AAdll be left on the stump, and the flap itself is usually badly fashioned and pointed. Should the Siu’geon feel that he has made this mistake, the Aviser plan will be at once to round off the ends of the flaps. Should they haA'e been cut too short, the soft parts must be forcibly retracted, and the bone cleared by cfrcular SAveeps of the knife, and saAAUi as high up as possible. The flap farthest fr’om the A'essels, as that on the outer side of the thigh or ahn, should be cut first. In making the imier flap, great care must be taken to wind the point of the knife Avell romid the bone, so as not to transfix and split down the vessels, but to cut them as long as possible. As a general rule, the less loose muscle that is left on a stump, the better : hence, Avhere there is an equal thickness of soft parts round the bone, as in the arm and thigh, the flaps should be cut short, Avell retracted, and the bone cleared by circnlar SAveeps of the knife as high as Jiecessary. The bone thus lies at the bottom of a conical holloAV beyond the angle of junction betAveen the flaps, and there is less chance of a conical stump bcijig left. In cutting a flap fr’om Avithout iiiAvards, it is of the greatest importance to remember that the edge of the knife must never be turned tOAvards the underAMPUTATIONS. 40 surface of the flap, hut always towards the parts to be remo'S'cd. After marking- out the flap with the point of the knife, the Surgeon takes the edge of the skin lightly between the finger and thmnlj of his left hand, and raises it fi-om the parts beneath. The portion of the flap Avhich is thus raised is therefore at right angles to its former position on the limb, and the knife must also be kept in a similar direction, or its edge AA'ill be turned towards the base of the flap, and by scoring its under surface Avill greatly increase the dangers of sloughing. There should be no hiury about raising a flap by dissection, as under the influence of auccsthetics the lengthening of the operation by two or three minutes is a matter of but little importance. It is better to spend one or tAvo minutes more OA'er the operation, than to haA'C to re-amputate on account of sloughing of the flaps. In 1839, Liston proposed a combination of the double flap and circular ojAeratioiis, which greatly improved the shape of the stiunp of the circidar method, and somewhat increased the ease of the operation. Taa'o semilunar incisions, AAdth their conA'exities doAnmards, are made through the skin from side to side of the limb : the flaps are then dissected up so as' to expose the muscles somcAyhat higher than the angles of union of the flaps : and the operation is completed as in the ordinary circular method. This method of operating is especially indicated in muscular parts, such as the arm, thigh, or leg. This is more pai’ticularly the case AALere the amputation is primaiy, as then the muscles often retract to so great an extent that it is difficidt to judge of the 2)rbper length at AA'hich to cut them. The adA’antage] of this proccdime over the ordinary flap or the circular operation is very great in certain circum- stances. In both cases, but more especially in flap-operations on stout muscular subjects, a large pad of muscle is apt to be left in the stnmp. This, which at first sight might appear an advantage, as an additional covering to the bones, is a decided disadA'antage, inasmuch as it often projects through the retraction of the skin coA'ering it, and is apt to slough and interfere Avith the proper union of the flaps. This pad is also disadvantageous after cieatrisation is completed, as at fii-st it foims a soft, flabby, and bulbous end to the stiunp, instead of a firm hard cicatrix ; and eventually it must Avaste and midergo fibro-cellular transformation, before the stiunp is finally consolidated. Hence, a stump that at first appears to be covered by a good cushion of soft pads, Avill, if these be chiefly muscidar, gradually shrink and Avaste, and may at last become41 AMPUTATION BY TEALE'S AIETHOD. conical. If the limb hare been the seat of much and long-continued suppura- tive action, the muscles do not retract -when cut, but hang soft and flaccid, as in a dead body. The flaps, therefore, need not be made so long as in primary amputation for injmy. And hero, also, too much muscle is disadvantageous, getting between the skin-flaps, and occasioning trouble and delay in the healing of the stump. If, howe’^'er, the flaps be themseh'cs much infiltrated by inflam- matory products, they must be cut so as to look somewhat long at the time of the operation, or else, as cieatrisation advances and the inflammatory products become absorbed, they will be found to be too short, and a conical stump will result. Ampidaiion hy the Rectanyular Flap.—The late Mr. Teale, of Leeds, for some yeai’s practised amputation by a long and short rectangular flap, with the '^dew of jjrociu-ing a more useful stump, and in the hope of somewhat diminishing the mortahty of the operation. In j)erfonning I amputation by this method, the I long flap is cut from that side of the limb where the parts are generally devoid of large blood-vessels and nerves; whilst the short flap is made to in- clude those structimes, which are cut across transversely, as sho'wn in the annexed figime from Teale. The long flaj) is perfectly square ; and the rule for its formation given by Teale is, that its length and breadth should each be equal to the half of the ciremnference of the limb at the place where the bones are to be sami. If the circumference be 9 inches, the length and the breadth of the flap should be each 4^- inches. Both flaps should in- clude all the soft parts of the limb. The short flap, which is always cut so as to contain the chief vessels and nerves, is one-fourth of the length of the long- one. The bones are sawn exactly at the angle of union of the flaps, udthout any pre\dous retraction of the soft parts. The vessels are then tied, and the long flap is folded over the end of the bone, and attached by sutures, as in the accompanying figure, to the short flap. Teale directs that the stump should be laid on a pillow lightly co-N’cred with gauze or linen, and protected from pressui-e by a cradle ; but in the early treatment he says that no dressings are required. The Results of amputation by this method were very satisfactory in Teale’s hands ; but more abiuidant evidence is required in order to show whether the mortality of amputations generally is dependent on the particular method adopted, rather than on constitutional causes and external influence's that operate equally in all cases. The rectangular method undoubtedly possesses one very gi-eat ad's'antage over the circular or ordinary flap, in gi\dng a soft and loose covering to the ends of the bones, admitting of direct bearing upon tliem ; especially advan- tageoijs after the amputation of the thigh or leg, when direct pressure can scarcely be dispensed with, and when a solid firm stiunp admitting it is of Fig. 10.—Lines of Incision in Teale’s Amputation.42 AMPUTATIONS. ^ eiy essential service to the patient. Teale advises, howcA-er, that the whole pressure be not borne by the stmnp, bnt that it be reduced to one-half the remainder being distributed in the usual way on the upper part of the limb and trunk : thus not only relieving the stump, but securing gi-eater steadiness of gait and firmness of step. In the upper extremity, howe’i'er, no direct lU’essurc is made upon the end of the stump in the adaptation of artificial limbs ; hence, in amjmtations of the fore-arm or arm, a thickly covered stump is not so much the object of the Siu-geon as in the leg and thigh. In the former instances, therefore, the rectangular appears to possess no advantage over the double flap method, so far as the after-utihty of the stump is concerned. Teale also claims as advantages of his method that there is provided a free de- pendent opening for the exit of discharges, and that when healed the cicatrix is far removed from the ends of the bones, being drawn up above and behind them. But, whilst fully admitting the advantage possessed by the rectangular method in the formation of a well-cushioned stump, especially in the lower extremity, we must not close our eyes to certain disadvantages Avhich appear to me to be inseparable from it. The disadvantage consists in the necessity of sawing the bone at a higher point when one long flap only is made, than when two shorter ones of more equal length are fashioned. Thus, for instance, in an amputation of the thigh for injiuy or disease of the knee-joint, the long rectangular flap in an adult woidd require to be about eight inches in length, and the femur must consequently be sawn at least as far as this above the patella; whereas, in the ordinary double-flap amputation, two shorter flaps, each about four inches in length, ^vill be fomid sufficient to cover in the bone, which may consequently be sami at a proportionately lower point. Thus the rectangular method contravenes one of the best-established principles in amputation, viz., not to remove the limb at a higher point than is absolutely necessary, the danger to life increasing with every inch that is removed : nor can it be considered to be advantageous in those cases in which length of stump is essential to the after-comfort and utility of the patient. Moreover in many injinles of the hmbs requiring amputation, the soft parts are often torn in such a way that a good covering may be got for the stump below the knee or elbow by short double flaps, or even by the circular method, Avhen there would be no possibility of fashioning a long flap fr’om uninjm’ed soft parts below' those joints; and the increased risk of high amputation woidd have to be encoimtered. In amputations for malignant disease, also, the long flap, which has to be cut in close proximity to the morbid growth, w'ould run a far greater risk of infiltration than would tw'o shorter ones taken higher up in the limb : the bone in both cases being sawm at the same level. Should imioii by the first inteution fail, and suppuration set in, in the rectangular amputation, the thick fleshy mass which enters into the conformation of the long flap becomes a soimce of great inconvenience, bulging out fr-om under the skin, and requiring considerable management in the after-treatment, Spence has devised a modification of Tcalc’s method, by wfiich he obtained aU its advantages by a much simpler operation. He docs not make a posterior flap, but compensates for it by retracting the soft parts fr'om the bones to an extent equal to its length. The anterior flap is made a little longer than the43 SAWING THE BONE. diameter of the limb ; and its angles being rounded, it is allowed simply to bam-- over the end of the stimip, without being folded upon itselt as in Teale’s operation. The posterior parts are divided from without inwards by a single sweep of the kniie. Equally good results may be obtained, as sugg;estea by^Lister, with still shorter flaps, by the following operation. An anterior roiuided flap, equal in length to two-thirds of the diameter of the hmb, is raised by cutting fi-om unthout inwards, taking with it as much muscle as may be required to form a good cushion over the bone ; a posterior skin-flap is then made rather more than half the length of the anterior, also rounded in shape. The posterior muscles are cut as short as possible, so as to set the flap free from the effects of their contraction. The soft parts are then retracted for about two inches and the bone sawn. By these means all the advantages claimed by Teale for his method, \iz., a good covering, a dependent opening for discharges, and a cicatrix fi-ee from the pressure of the end of the bone, are obtained with the smallest possible sacrifice in the length of the limb. As by all these methods the cicatrix is some way posterior to the end of the bone, the patient is capable of bearing a certain portion of his weight directly on the end of the stump, which gives greatly increased steadiness and power in the use of the artificial limb. Amputation hy one Long Flap.—In some amputations, as at the shoulder and hip-joints, owing to the anatomical configuration of the parts, only one long flap can be made. And in others, as in the removal of the fingers through a phalangeal articulation, or of the metatarsal bone of the gi-eat toe, it is fomid more convenient to make but one long flap, cutting through the soft parts transversely on the opposite side of the limb. This method has been extended by some Sm-geons to aU amputations, but it appears to me to possess no ad- vantage over the double flap, and to be attended by the same inconvenience as that which accompanies Teale’s method. 3. Sawing the Bone.—So soon as the incisions have been made thi-ough the soft parts, the bones must be cleared for the application of the saw. This is best done, when there is only a single bone, by a firm circular sweep of the knife fi-om heel to point round the mider segment of the bone, and then another round the upper surface in the opposite direction. If there be two bones, care must be taken in clearing them not to direct the edge of the knife upwards into the interosseous space higher than the line to which the saw is to be apphed, lest any ai-teiybe cut where it viU, on account of its retraction, be difl&cult to secine it. The bone hai-ing been properly cleared, the flaps must be firmly retracted by^an assistant, in order to allow the saw to be applied opposite the highest point of the incision through the soft parts. For the pinpose of retraction, the assistant’s hands are quite sufficient, though some Sm-geons still use “ retrac- tors,” made of split pieces of linen cloth or of wash-leather. But, although “ retractors ” may not be required for the pm-pose of di’a-wing back the soft jiarts, they are of great use in protecting the muscles fi-om the teeth of the saw and fi-om the bone-dust produced : for the laceration of the deep muscles by the saw, and the imbedding of particles of bone-dust in their substance, inter- fere seriously with union. In order to saw the bone quickly and steadily, there are several points deserving attention. The first cut should be made so as to foi-m a deep groove to receive the teeth : to do this, the heel of the saw is steadied against the left thumb, Avhich is pressed on the bone ; and the instru-44 amputations. nicnfc is clra^vn fairly and sharply along the whole line of its teeth from heel to. point. Ihe groove thus formed recei^■es the edge of the saw ; and the bone may then he quickly cut through by long, light, and sweeping movements of the instrmuent from point to heel, the position being gradually changed from the hoi izontal to the a ertical as progress is made. The Surgeon must, with his left hand, support carefully the part to bo removed ; neither depressing it, so as to snap the bone as it is weakened by samng ; nor raising it so as to run the risk of locking the saw. When the Surgeon takes charge of the flaps him- self, the care of the hmb must be left to an assistant. When there are two bones in the limb of equal strength, as in the fore-arm, they should be cut through at the same time ; but in the leg, the fibida, being the weakest, shoidd always be first divided. Shoidd the division be made irregularly, and splinters of bone project, these must be snipped off ivith cutting-pliers. 4. Aerest oe H.a:MOREE:AGB.—After the limb has been remoi'ed, the first thing to be done is to restrain arterial haemoiThage. This may be effected by one of three methods :—hgatiu’e, acupressure, or torsion. If ligatiu-es be used, the main and larger arteries must first be tied. For this purpose, fine com- ]iressed tvhipcord is the best material. The ends of these ligatures, knotted together, must be left long, so that they may be distinguished. Usually from two to four or six smaller i-essels require to be tied, and they should be secured with ordinary ligatiu'e-thread ; but sometimes, either from the existence of malignant disease, or of extensive siqipimative action in the limb, the stump is excessively vascular, and a very large number of ligatures may be required. I have, in these circumstances, more than once had occasion to apply between twenty and thirty ligatures to vessels in the arm and thigh. As union always takes place by gTanulation in such cases, it signifies little how many ligatiu’es are put on, the smaller ones separating early. One half of each hgatiwe should be cut off close to the knot, and the single threads thus left must be brought out at the lower angle of the Avonnd, through Avhich any discharge that may form may drain away. Silver or iron wire may be used for ligatiu’ing the arteries, Avith the AueAV of preventing the suppuration that residts from the initation of the ordinary silk or thread ligatures, and thus facihtating miion by the fii’st intention. I haA'e employed AAore in several instances, l^nt haA’e foimd that it does not cut through the artery as the thread does, and consequently does not detach itself, but requires to be pulled or tAvisted off—a procediu-e Avhich may be attended by htemorrhage. The practice of cutting the ends of ligatures short, whether hempen or metallic, is most objectionable ; for, although the stump may heal over them, they eventually become sources of irritation, and set up suppiuation or deA’elope neuralgia. During the last few years carbolised catgut ligatiues have been extensiA'ely used, being cut short and left in the Avoiuid. Their use has been foimd to be attended by no ca il consequences, eA’en AA'hen the antiseptic mode of dressing is not adopted. Acupressure, and torsion of the ends of ent arteries, are often employed instead of the ligature by the adA'oeates of these methods. For a detail of the mode of arresting luemoiThage by these means, and tor a comparison of their merits Avith those of the ligatiue, I must refer to Chapter XIV. Free arterial bleeding Avill sometimes take place fi'om a pohit in the cut siu’facc of the bone, in consequence of the diA’ision of the trunk of the nu-DJIESSIXG THE STUMP. 45 tritious artery. This hfcmorrhage is best an-ested by pressing a small wooden plug into the bleeding bone. To this a piece of m're shoidd be attached, so that it may be di-ami out when loosened by suppuration at the end of a few days. The mode of union of the flaps of a stump, the dressing required, and the gene- ral management of the part after an amputation, differ in no respect from what takes place in the healing of primary incised wounds, to be hereafter described. 5. DRESSixa THE Stump.—An amputation leaves a clean cut wound, which must be treated on those principles that guide the Surgeon in the management of all incised woimds, and which will be fully described in Chapter IX. They may be sunnned up briefly thus 1. Eemo^-al of all coagulum, bone-detritus, or other foreign body ; 2. Close and accurate coaptation of flaps ; 3. Efficient drainage to allow escape of sero-sanguineons fluid; 4. Perfect rest of the part ; o. Scrupulous attention to cleanliness, and to avoidance of decomposition of fluids. Callender’s method of treating stumps seems to combine these requisites more perfectly than any other. It consists essentially in the use of a di’ainage- tube for from twenty-foim to thirty-six hom-s, so as to allow the escape of bloody serum, placing the stump on a well-padded splint, to Avhich it is bandaged, so as to prevent all voluntary movement and distimbance by involuntary tmtehings, and dressing the cut edges with lint soaked in carbolic acid and oil and cleansing them Avhen necessary with a glass brush dipped in a strong spirituous solution of carbolic acid. Sutures may be either of well waxed silk or of metallic AA’ire. They should be introduced through the lips of the incision at inteiwals of an inch : care being taken to leave the most dependent angles of the stump open, and to draw out the ligatiu-es through them. In cases of primary amputation for injmy, or in any case in Avhich oozing is expected, the sutimes should be intro- duced whilst the patient is under chloroform, and left loose. When this is done, silken sutimes must be employed, and wet lint applied between the surfaces and over the outside, the dressing of the Avound being deferred for a feAV horns, pmtil the smffaces are glazed ; a slip of lint, Avet Avith carbolised Avater, being interposed betAA'een the flaps, and this removed and the stiunp dressed in six homs. But in amputations for disease, when patients are in a low and imtable condition, it is better to apply the dressings immediately after the performance of the amputation, before the effects of the chloroform are recoA'ered from. In these cases metallic sutures should be employed ; they are less in-itating, and may be retained longer. Before di-essing the stump, it is desirable that all oozing should haA'e ceased, lest a coagulum form between the flaps, and so interfere with union ; AAuth this vieAV, a jug or tAA’O of cold AA'ater may be poured OA^er the face of the stump. The dressings should then be applied. They should be as light and unirritating as possible. The object that Ave have in Aiew is the union of the flaps as speedily as possible—not only along their edges, but throughout the deeper portion of the stump. Strips of adhesive plaster, about fifteen inches long, should be applied between the points of suture, and the stump bandaged from the upper part of the limb as far as the line of incision, so as to bring together and steady the deeper parts of the AA’ound, more particularly Avhere the bone intei’A'enes betAA'een the flaps. xV piece of wet lint, kept constantly moist Avith cold carbolised AA\ater, should then be laid over the line of incision, the stump comfortably supported on pilloAvs,amputations. 46 mid fclic ivcio'lit of the Ijcdclothes taken off by a cradle. After this, it should he disturbed as little as possible for a feiy days. The carbolised lint, which n ill become soiled by a reddened sero-sanguinolent discharge, must be changed e^ ciy lew hoiu’s. Should the flaps be muscular and heavy, the stimip may advantageously be supported on a well-padded wire splint. Union by the first intention ” can only be expected to take place in certain amputations, and even in them not wholly and entirely. When the hone is ^•ery large, as the femur, an angle is apt to be left between the flaps at the apex of the stmnp, Avhich, by preA'enting complete coaptation at this point, renders direct union impossible ; so also, if a cavity exist in the bone, as the glenoid or cotyloid, in amputation at the shoulder and hip, there vill necessarily he suppuration. Then, again, muscle will not adhere directly to synovial mem- brane or to cartilage in disarticulations, and in many cases not even to the cut smfacc of bone. In fact, for all these reasons, independently of any consti- tutional causes, complete inimary union, or that by the “ first intention,” is much more rare than is commonly supposed, and is more frequently talked about than seen in amputations. However, whatever portion of the stump unites directly and primarily is so much gained, and no effort should be left untried to secure so desirable a result. When suppuration sets in, warm-water dressings should be substituted for the cold lint, and every possible attention should he paid to cleanliness by a frequent change of the dressings, more especially in waim weather. When suppuration is subsiding, and cicatrisation going on, the bandage may advantageously be brought over the face of the stump. As a general nde, it will be found that a naiTow roller will adapt itself better than a hroad one. After cicatrisation is completed, the patient should be allowed to go about oii crutches, but must not wear an artificial limb for several months, luitil the- parts have become finnly consolidated ; during the whole of this time the- stump should be kept carefully bandaged, and not exposed to injuiy. SiMULTAlfEOUS OE EaPIDLY CONSECUTIVE AMPUTATION OP TwO LiMBS,. requiriug removal for severe injury or for gangrene, has occasionally been successfully practised, either by two Surgeons perfoiming the two amputations at the same time ; or by the same Sm-geon doing first one and then the other,, the vessels of the first limb being secured by an assistant whilst the second limb is being removed. The circulation through both lower extremities may be completely arrested by compressing the aorta by means of Lister’s tourniquet. By means of this valuable instrument, I have amputated both thighs in close- succession vdthout waiting for the ligature of the arteries iii that which was first removed. The object in two simultaneous amputations is to lessen the- contiuuance of shock to the system, by throwing, as it were, that of the two operations into one. In doing this, however, the Surgeon must necessarily be- guided by the circumstances of the case. If the patient were very gveatly depressed, the infliction of so severe an injmy as a double amputation might probably extinguish life at once ; and, if it were possible to wait after the removal of the first limb, until the shock of the operation had passed oft; before the second was amputated, it might be desirable to do so ; but if the- patieut were not too much depressed, the simultaneous or rather rapidly consecutive double amputation would probably be the safer coiu’se.MOlililD CONDITIONS OF STUMPS. 47 or two have -Arteiy of Tliigli-Stiuni) laid oiien.

On examining the Structure of a Shmij), after a year elapsed from the time of its formation, it will he found to lie composed of a mass of fibro-cellular tissue, the muscular and tendinous structures that enter into its fomation ha^■ing become thus trans- formed. The ends of the bones will be foimd to bo rounded, and the medullary canal filled up, the vessels being obliterated up to the netuest collateral branch (Fig. 12). The ends of the nerves are thickened, and commonly assume a bulbous appearance (Fig. 13). On examining these rounded or oval tumoiu’s, they will be found to be fibro- cellular masses, having nervous fibrillm thiuly scattered throughout. The luoper adaptation of Artificial Limbs is a matter of considerable consequence ; and the ingenious mechanical contrivances that are at the present day adapted to stumps, leave little to be desired. The Siugeon had better leave the details of these mechanical con- trivances to the instrument-maker; but he should see that they are made light, consistently with sufficient strength and support, and that the end of the stump is never pressed upon by them. Thus, after amputation of the thigh, the artificial limb should take its bearing point from the lower part of the peh'is and hip. In amputation im- mediately below the knee, this joint should be bent and received into the socket of the instrument ; and, if the amputation be at a loAver point than this, and the stump be extended into the artificial limb, its end must be protected from injiuious pressiue. Ea-cii in the case of disarticulation at the ankle-joint, where the soft tissues of the heel are left, pressure can seldom be borne upon the end of the stump. Morbid Conditions of Stumps.—Necrosis.—It not un- freqnently happens that the end of the bone in a stimip dies. Most commonly this is the consequence of inflammation (osteo-myelitis) set up in that portion of the bone which is left'in the stimip, as the residt of Avhich its vitality is lost, and necrosis sets in; or it may occiu* in consequence of the injiny inflicted by the saw. This is especially apt to happen in persons of feeble constitution, in AAdiom the limb has, prcAdously to the operation, been the seat of abscess that has denuded the bone or otherAvise injured its \itality. In these cases a fistulous opening A\ill be lefo leading doAAii to the necrosed bone, AA'hich usually se- parates three or four months after the operation in the shape of a complete ring, Avith iiTcgnlarly spiked pro- longations stretching ft-om its upper part (Fig. 14); after this has been Fig. 14 .—Necrosed end of Femur from Stump.48 A21FUTATI0NS. jiit.f'iudi, uccomiiig gTadiially tmimer. In some cases the spiciilafced jDart is very sharp-edged; in others, as in Fig. Id, it is somev-hat smoothed by long contact mth ’the pus that has sim-oimded it. Conical or Siujar-loaf" SkmjJs, as they are called, commonly foma either in consequence of the flaps having origmally been cut too short, or from the bone iiothaAing been sawn off snfiicientlyhigh above the angle of the flaps • but in other cases they may occim, though the stmnp has been skilfully flxshioned in ■consequence of the soft parts, which have been the seat of inflammatory action mid snppiu-ation before the amputation, retracting dining the granulating pro- cess so as to denude the bone. In such cases as these, great retraction and contraction of the flaps are apt to go on during cicatrisation, so that the bone may never be covered at all, but be exposed at the bottom of an iiritable ulcer ; or, if the soft parts do coalesce, the cicatrix udll be unable to support the slightest pressure without becoming idcerated. In these circumstances, the only remedy consists in laying open the stimip, and cutting off about three inches of the bone. If the stump be too long and projecting, so as constantly to be in the patient’s way, there is no remedy but to perform a second amputation higher up. This is especially re- qiu’red in badly fashioned stimips of the leg, where c the limb has been re- the patient uses a wooden pin. But these reductions of badly fashioned stumps •should not be lightly undertaken, for the mortality is great after such operations. Amarismal Enlargement of the arteries of a stump is extremely rare. The only case with which I am acquainted is one described by Cadge, in which an aneiu'ismal varix between the posterior tibia! artery and veins formed in a stump after disarticidation of the ankle-joint (Fig. 15, a). Painful and Sjmsmodic Stumps.—The nerves in a stump natm-ally become somewhat expanded and bulbous ; and no material inconvenience results from this condition. But it occasionally happens that a distinct tuberose enlarge- ment forms in connection with one of them, and attains the size ot a cheriy or •a walnut; and, this being pressed against the end of the bone, the stimip Becomes the seat of intense pain of a neuralgic character, more particularly whenever it is touched, ivhen a sensation like an electric shock is felt. In •such circumstances, excision of this bulbous extremity of the nerve, or resection moved too far below the knee, so that it jirojects backwards in an awkward manner, and is constantly liable to accident when Fig. 15.—Aiicurismal Varix in a Stump.AMPUTATION. AFTER 49 MORTALITY of the stump so as to i-cmovc the end of the hone and the whole of the cicatrix, is necessary, and will effect a cure. Sometimes a nervous twig may become implicated in, and compressed by, the cicatrix. Here a more limited excision will remove the pain. Besides this form of painfid stimip, which may happen in the strongest and healthiest subjects, and is entirely dependent on local causes, there is another condition in which the stump becomes not only the seat of intense pain, but of continuous convulsive twitchings. This form of painful stimip arises fi’om constitutional causes, and most frc(][ucntly occuis in females, more particularly in those who are of the hysterical temperament, and are or liaA'c been subject to nem'algic pains elscAvhere. In these cases the general cutaneous sensibility of the stump is increased; it is the seat of coinudsive jerkings or twitchings, and the pain is more oi less intermittent, being inci’eased under the influence of various emotional and constitutional causes. In such cases, the treatment should be conducted on the general principles that will be fidly discussed when we come to speak of neuralgia. Xo excision of the nerves of the stump, or even amputation higher up, is of any avail; the disease, being constitutional, will certainly retiu’ii in each suc- cessive stump, until at last the shoulder or the hip may be reached without any pennanent benefit to the patient. Occasionally after amputation a condition of chronic or subacute neuritis, ■with sclerosis of the nerve, is setup, which has a tendency slowly but steadily to extend itself upwards, invol'ving new nerves as it goes, and finally, iDerhaps, leading to changes in the spinal cord itself. The symptoms and treatment are those of chronic neuritis, which will be fully described mider Injm-ies of Xerves. Strumous or Malignant Degeneration may occm* in a stump, presenting the ordinary characters of these affections met vith elsewhere. In the strumous stump, secondary amputation may advantageously be performed ; but on the recurrence of malignant disease it is seldom justifiable, as there is probably deposit in internal organs or contamination of the lymphatics. Fattg Degeneration of the muscles of a limb, arising from their disuse, gives rise to a peculiar appearance in the stump. During the amputation, the muscles look like pieces of yellow wax, and are firm : no atrophy, so far as size is concerned, has taken place ; the fat being deposited between the musculai- fibres, producing atrophy of them by its pressure, and occupying their place, so that the general size of the limb and fulness of the stump are preserved. Union takes place in these circimistances, though somewhat slowly ; at least, this has occiuTcd iu several cases in Avhich I have observed this condition. In one of these I amputated the leg for disease of the foot of nine years’ standing, and in another the thigh for disease of the knee of fomteen years’ standing. MORTALITY AFTER AMPUTATION. The general causes of death after operations have already been considered but we must now examine some special points connected with the relativ( mortality after amputations of different kinds, and the cause of the differ ■once that exists. The principal causes of death after amputation are tin influence of shock, the occun-ence of secondary hmmonhage, pymmia, sep ticaimia, erysipelas, phlebitis, and congestive pneumonia ; besides these, hos pital gangi’ene and sloughing of the stump occasionally caiTy off the patient VOL. 1. K5° AMPUTATIONS, <jxhaustion and the other minor and more A'ariod causes that I have mentioned. Pyremia is the most frequent cause of death after amputations, nearly one half of the patients that die perishing from this disease. Bryant has shown that, at Guy s Hospital, it is fetal in ten per cent, of all amputations, and in forty-two per cent, of fatal cases, and that it is most frequent after am- putations through limbs, the tissues of Avhich are in a nonnal condition, and where a large sm-fece of healthy hone is exposed, as in amputations for injury, and in the remoA'al of limbs for tumours, talipes, ankylosis, &c. It is not so common after amputations performed for chronic joint-disease. Shock is a frequent cause of death after primary amputations of the larger limbs. The circumstances AA’hich more specially influence the general result of amputa- tions, as weU as the particular cause of death after the operation, maybe divided into two classes ;—a. Those that have reference to the general constitutional condition of the patient. (3. Those that are connected with the operation itself. a. To the fii'st class may be referred 1, Acje2, General Health ; and 3, Ilijfjimik Conditions. 1. Age exercises a material influence on the result of amputations. As a general rule it may be stated that, the younger the patient, the greater the likelihood of a successful result. At early periods of life, also, there is a great exemption from low secondary diseases of the septic type ; and if death occur, it is usually from exhaustion or intercuri'ent Aisceral mischief. At advanced periods of life, amputations, whether for accident or disease, are amongst the most fatal operations in Surgery, more especially Avhen the loAver extremity is> the seat of operation. Then, indeed, recovery can scarcely be looked for. 2. The General Health of the patient preA'ious to the operation exercises necessarily a most poAverful influence on the chances of recoA'ery. The state of the kidneys, more especially, is of gi’eat importance in this respect; for no con- dition tends more certainly to a fatal tennination, than a chronically diseased state of those organs. The results of amputation are also necessarily Awdely different, according as the operation is practised on the healthy inhabitant of a country district, or on the cachectic and debilitated denizen of a large toum. The causes of death also differ in these cases. In the coimtry, haemoiThage or acute inflammation ; in towns, exhaustion and septic diseases, commonly lead to the fatal result. And imdoubtedly shock and septic diseases are the tAA’o- principal causes that determine death after amputation. The influence of Slioch and of Se^tk Disease is very differently felt in different amputations. The greater the portion of body that is removed the more severely is shock felt. In these cases, also, the influence of septic agencies becomes more marked. This is om’ug to two causes : 1. The depression of the nervous system consequent on the shock, and on the loss of blood that is the frequent accomiDaniment of a gueat operation, tending to loAver the resist- ing poAver of the system to all noxious influences, and thus predisposing to septic absoiqAtion, constitutional or local; and, 2. The large siufacc of Avound exposed, rendering local contamination more likely to occur. The influence of shock and septic disease in amputations is Avell marked. Out of 80 consecutive cases occiuTing at UniA'ersity College Hospital, Avhich form the basis of these obsen'ations, there Avere 3 deaths fr’om shock (all primary), and 10 from pytemia and erysipelas ; leaving only 8 deaths to be accounted lor byE 2 INFLUENCE OF SHOCK. Oufc of a total of 031 amputations occun-ing in metropolitan hospitals, in which 239 deaths occnrred, 110 died from shock and pymmia together, being 17-0 per cent, of the whole operated on, or 40 per cent, of the total deaths— and this is iiTespectire of those that are reported as dying of “ exhaustion,” which is closely allied to shock, or fi’om “ erysipelas,” “ low celluhtis,” and fonns of septic disease other than pymmia. This ten-ible disease proved fatal in as nearly as possible 30 per cent, of all the deaths, and shock in about 10 per cent, of the deaths, or in 3’8 per cent, of all the amputations. But the respective influences of these tivo great causes of death after ampu- tations will be found not only to vaiy greatly, according as the operation is primary, secondai'y, or foi’ disease, but also to exercise very different degrees of influence in different hospitals. Shock was most felt in primary amputations, in the proportion of 25 per cent, of the deaths ; was but little fatal in secondary amputations, 6 per cent. ; and was entirely absent as a cause of death in pathological amputations. Pyrnmia was fatal in about one-third, or 33 per cent., of the primary ampu- tations, and in 44’4 per cent, of the secondary; and in those for disease it again acquired nearly the level of the primary—viz. 34’6 per cent, Pymmia is proportionately more fatal after amputations of the upper than of the lower extremity, occasioning about 40 per cent, of the deaths in the former, against 34 per cent, of the latter, after amputations for all causes. In primary amputations the disparity is more marked, being about 50 per cent, of all deaths in the upper, against about 32 in the lower hmb ; shock, on the other hand, being more fatal by far after primary amputations of the lower than of the upper extremity, owing doubtless to the larger mass removed. The influence of shocJc is necessarily most felt in primary amputations. Indeed, its fatal results are almost entirely confined to amputations performed within twenty-four hours of the infliction of the injiuy. I have never known a case of intermediate or secondary amputation, or amputation for disease, in which the patient died from this cause. Fatal shock, in fact, is the result of the combined depressing influence of the uijm-y and of the operation. It occurs in exact proportion to the severity of the injmy, the amount of loss of blood, and the age of the patient. It is often rather referable to the injury than to the operation ; and it becomes a question whether, in many cases of serious and almost hopeless smash of a limb, it might not be better to let the patient expire in peace, than subject him to the repetition of a shock which his nervpus system ■will l)e utterly unable to endure. This is more especially the case in extensive crush and disorganisation of the lower extremity up to or above the middle of the thigh, such as are not unfrequent at the present day from railway accidents, in which the mangling of the limb rather resembles that produced by cannon-shot than by an ordinaiy injury of civil life. In these cases amputation through the upper third of the thigh, or at the hip-joint, is the only available operation. It is usually done in such cases. But is it ever successfifl in the full-grown adult ? That is a question which deserves the serious consideration of hospital surgeons. I am not acquainted with a single case in which such an operation has succeeded in general hospital practice in men who have airivcd at full maturity. In children and yoimg adults it has proved successful. The three cases in Avhich it was done, out of the eightyAMPUTATIOXS. 52 Uni\ crsifcy College cases, all died ol shock. The same catastrophe has happened ill every other case on record vdth which I am accpiaiiitcd. It is an operation that has been abandoned by military surgeons in cases of compound com- minuted fi'acture of the femur from bullet-wound in this situation ; ought it not to be equally discontinued by civil surgeons in those more hopeless cases of utter smash of the limb that occiu’ in their practice ? For my own part, I shall never again, except in children and young people, amputate in that situation for such injimies—hopeless alike, Avhether left or subjected to the knife ; but siu'ely better for the patient to be left to die in peace than to be again tortured by amputation, which all experience has shown to be useless. It is of importance to observe, in reference to these cases of death from shock after primary amputations, that the fatal result happens in a feiv hours, usually Avithin twenty-four, of the performance of the operation. Hence, although it may be disposed to by the previous condition of the patient, and the influence exercised upon his powers of endmance by the seA'erity of the injmy, the loss of blood, his age, &c.—for death from shock necessarily ocems more fr-equently mider similar conditions of injmy at advanced than at early periods of life—or even by season of year, yet it cannot in any Avay be affected by the conditions to which the patient is exposed subsequently to the performance of the opera- tion, so far at least as hospitals or other external influences are concerned. We must, therefore, look upon death from shock as a part of the general accident to which the patient has been exposed and of the injmy that he has sustamed, aggravated, doubtless, by the further depressing influence exercised by so serious an operation as an amputation possibly high up in one of the limhs. It is interesting to observe that season exercises an influence on the liabihty to death fr’om shock after primary amputations. According to Hewsou, of Phila- delphia, it is most fatal in AAunter. The reason is obAdous : the cold, to Avhich the sufferer has been exposed at the time of the occurrence of the accident for which he has to midergo an amputation, is an additional cause of Autal depression. If, therefore, Ave want to lessen the mortahty consequent on these opera- tions, the first point to look to is not to amputate needlessly in hopeless cases of smash of the thigh high up, in order to give “ a last chance ” to a patient whose Autal powers haA'e already been depressed to the loAA'cst ebb by a fearful mutilation. Such amputations, which sometimes consist in little more than the severance of a hmb still attached to the trmik by shreds of muscle, ought scarcely to find theii’ way into a statistical table professing to gfr e the general results of operations the majority of which are more deliberately performed, and Avith a better prospect of success. They ought, in point of fact, to consti- tute a class of cases apai-t, in Avhich the operation is sirbsidiary to the injury ' that has preceded and that leads to it; the more so, as they are frequently com- plicated with the internal injuries which are not detected until after the death of the patient. Shock, as has already been shoAAUi, exercises its influence chiefly in primary amprrtations ; far less in secondary ones ; and disappears entirely, as a cause of death, in pathological amputations. There, howcA-er, it is replaced by « exhaustion.” This condition stands in the same relation to amputations for disease that shock does to those that are practised for injury. Death byINFLUENCE OF EE AT OF OPERATION. 53 “exhaustion ” or “collapse ” is, in feet, an indication that the impression pro- duced by the operation on the nervous system has been gi-eater than the already enfeebled powers of the patient were able to endui-e ; and the frequent occniTence of these terms, as indicating the cause of death in any table of amputation statistics, may be taken as evidence of the operation having been practised too often, when the patient was already so enfeebled by long-con- tiiined disease, or so exhausted by discharges and suffering, as to be unable to support the additional depressing influence of a serious sni’gical operation. In the retiu-ns of Dr. Chadwick of the results of amputations in the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, “exhaustion is stated to be by fai the most frequent cause of death. Out of the 180 fatal cases, it is retui-ned as the cause of death in 98, or ol'-l per cent.; whilst “ collapse ” is stated to have been fatal in 21, or 11’8 per cent., and “shock” in only 2 cases. I cannot but think that these terms are here used in a somewhat different sense from that in which we cmjiloy them, and that they rather represent what we should call “ shock.” However this may be, the fact is certain that in these Boston cases no fewer than 122 deaths out of 180, or 67 per cent., ocem-red from causes that were altogether independent of any septic hospital influence, a state of things that speaks highly for the sanitaiy condition of the hospital. The next and by far the most important of aU the causes of death after operations in hospitals, is undoubtedly the development of se]3tic disease. The importance of this is obvious, from a consideration of the following statistics. Out of the 21 deaths that occimred in the 80 University College amputations, no fewer than 10, or nearly one-half, arose from this cause ; and, out of a grand total of 239 deaths ocemTing in foim metropolitan hospitals, 86 died from pymmia alone, without including other septic diseases and secondary septic visceral inflammations ; there being nearly four times as many deaths from pyaemia as from shock. Dr. Chadwick, in the report of the Massachusetts General Hospital, retiuns 42 deaths fr’om pyremia out of the 180 fetal cases that occurred in 692 ampu- tations of all kinds, being in the proportion of 23'3 per cent, on the deaths, and only of o'7 per cent, on the whole number of amputations—a most remarkably low percentage of septic mortality, of which it may be taken as the whole and sole representative, there being no deaths returned from erysipelas or any other hospital disease. The circumstances coimected with the operation itself that influence materially its residt are, 1—The Seat of the amputation. 2. The Structure of Ihe Bone sawn. 3.

With regard to the influence of the Seat of amputation on the result of the operation, it may be stated as a general rule, that the risk is greater in proportion as tlie size of the part that is amputated increases, and as the line ol amputation approaches the tnmk ; in fact, the nearer it is to the trmik, the greater is the danger. In the larger limbs, more especially in the thigh, every additional inch that is removed appears to make a difference in this respect.

It needs no formal argimient to shoAv that the amputation of the toe or 0 the loot is less hazardous than that of the leg or the thigh. The subjoined table, derived from the examination of statistics of amputation in civil practice, collected fr’om various British, Continental, and American sources, shows clearly the increase in the ratio of mortality as the operation approaches the trunk.* SEAT.

Thus, ill the British army in the Crimea the percentages of death were, after amputation of the foreaim, 7 ; of the upper arm, 19 ; of the shoulder- joint, 35 ; of the foot, IG ; of the leg, 37 ; of the knee, 57 ; of the thigh, 64 ; and of the hip, 100 ; figures most creditable to the skill of the surgeons employed, but showing the progi’essive tendency to increase with the size of the limb removed. In the French army in the Crimea, the percentage of mortality after amputation of the fore-arm was 45 ; of the arm, 55 ; of the shoulder-joint, 61 ; of the foot, 76 ; of the leg, 72 ; of the knee-joint, 91 ; of the thigh, 92 ; and of the hip, 100. In the Italian campaign of 1859, the percentages of the mortality in the French army—including in some cases operations on ivoiuided Austrians—were : fore-arm, 42 ; arm, 56 ; shoulder- joint, 55 ; foot, 55 ; leg, 70 ; knee-joint, 75 ; thigh, 78 ; hip-joint, 57. In the war of the American rebellion the percentages of mortality were as follow, showing markedly how rapidly it runs up in accordance mth the size of the part removed : fingers and hand, 1-6 ; wist, 5'5 ; forearm, IG‘5 ; arm, 21-2 ; shoulder, 39'2 ; partial of foot, 9'2 ; ankle-joint, 13‘4 ; leg, 26 ; knee, 55 ; thigh, 64‘4 ; hip, 85*7. Not only is there this increase in the rate of mortality as the operation approaches the trunk, but in the larger limbs, more especially in the thigh, every additional inch that is removed appears to make a difference in this respect. Thus, in oiu- army in the Crimea, of 178 amputations of the thigh, 44 were in the upper third, and of these 38, or 86 per cent., proved fatal ; 68 were in the middle third, and of these 41, or 60 per cent., died ; whilst in the lower third the mortahty out of 66 cases was 37, or 56 per cent. In the French army in the Crimea, according to Chenu, of 81 amputations of the thigh at the upper third, 37, or 60 per cent., died ; in 91 amputations at the middle third, there were 63 deaths, or 69 per cent. ; and in the lower third there were 101 cases, wth 59 deaths, or 58'4 per cent. In the Italian * The numbers referred to in this Chapter have been derived in great part pom the Tables pubUshed by Mr. James Lane in the first volume of the last edition of Cooper's Surgicnl Jiiciioiiarn: Sir J.

Again, among 21 amputations of the hiunerus at the neck in the French army in the Crimea, the mortality was 9 or 43 per cent. ; in 229 at the upper third, it was G2, or 27 per cent.; in 145 at the middle third it was 27, or 18 per cent.; and in 55 at the lower third it was G, or 11 per cent. _ i Not only do the size of the part remoYcd, and its proximity to the ti-unS:, influence materiaUy the general mortahty after amputation; but these conditions also influence the particular cause of death. Thus after the smaller amputations, as of a toe, for instanee, death ocem-s only in imhealthy states of the constitution, from the occun’ence of erysipelas, or of some of the various forms of diffuse inflammation. Death after the larger amputations more fr-equently results from causes eonneeted -with the operation itself, as, for instance, secondai-y htemon-hage, shock, or exhaustion by the abstraction of the large quantity of blood contained in the limb, as well as by that lost during the operation. After the removal of the whole of a limb, as in the case of amputation at the hip-joint, it is possible that the cause suggested by Cox, viz., the remoA’al of a limb in which the blood undergoes changes of importanee to the rest of the economy, may materially affect the lesult. 2. The Part of the Bone that is sawn through may influence the result. Amputations through the eancellous ends of long bones are less dangerous, in one respect, than those through their shafts, in consequence of the medullary canal not being opened when the section is made near the articular end ; so that the liabihty to diffuse suppuration of this caAuty, and consecutive phlebitis and pytemia, is diminished. 3. The mortality resulting from amputations is perhaps more directly in- fluenced by whether the operation is done for Injury or Disease, than by any other cause, being far greater in corresponding limbs after injury than disease, except as regards amputation of the fore-arm. In the following table may be seen the results of 307 eonsecutfr'e cases of amputation performed at University College Hospital up to May, 1871. Of these 307 cases, 79 died, yielding as 3ieai-ly as possible a mortality of 25 per eent. Since the publication of these, 80 additional amputations have been performed up to May, 1873. Of these 387, exactly 100 have died, being at the rate of 25'8 per cent. The rate of mortality has throughout, under many different modes of treatment, been .singularly steady, ranging betAveen 23*5 and 25'5 per cent. RESULTS OF AMPUTATION IN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL.

After amputation for injury, also, there is a greater liability to the occun’ence of gangrene of the stumj), and pyeemia and its secondary effects, than in the case of the removal of a limb for disease ; in which the principal causes of death usually appear to be exhaustion, and the supervention of disease of the limgs. In amputation in cases of disease, it AviU be found that those patients do best in whom the disease is most chronic. This is especially observable in cases of disease of bones and of the joints. 4. The Nature of the Disease for Avhich the amputation is performed influences its mortality. Thus amputations for malignant disease are more fatal than those for caries of bone or diseased joints. In cases of diseased joint, there is a greater tendency to recover Avhen the afiection is of a simple than AA'hen it is of a tuberculous natime. Birkett has pointed out that disease of internal organs, often of the same natm-e as that for which the operation is performed, is foiuid after death in a large j)roportion of j)atients AA'he die after amputation. When suppiu'ative disorganisation of a joint is very acute, amjAutation, more particularly if the affected articulation be ot large size, as the knee, is attended by A’ery mifaA'omable results. The tendency to pycBmia is A'ery strong in such cases, the blood being loaded Avith effete materials, the products of the inflammatory action, AA’hich are specially apt toAMRUTATIONS. 57 riilMARY AXn SECONDARY run into suppuration, both in it and m the tissues g-eneiaUy. ^ disease has once become chronic, the precise period at which performed exercises but little influence on the mortality, provided it be not le- fen-ed to too late a stage, when the patient’s constitution is worn out by hectic Amputations of expediency—those performed for the coiiveuieiice of the patient, as in cases of talipes or ankylosis, but not necessary, so far ^ me is concerned-are especially fatal. Bryant has shomi that, at Guys Hospital, death has followed in 40 per cent, of these amputations of the lower extremity. 5. In amputation in cases of injmy an important question has to be detei-mined, viz., the influence exercised by the Time that has elapsed from the infliction of the iiijiuy to the performance of the amputation. Aot oidy the rate of mortahty, but the conditions that immediately occasion the fatal event, are infliieneed by the period at which the operation is performed. Amputations for injury are commonly divided by siu’geons into Pt immy and Secondary; the fTimary being those that are performed during the first BESULTS OF PBIMAEY AND SECONDABY AMPUTATIONS IN CASES OF INJUEY, AT UNIVEESITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL.

I think, however, that this distinction is somewhat trivial, and not very easily applied in practice ; and that it is better to include under the term secondary, all amputations performed after inflammatory action has been set up in the injured part. ^he subjoined table, collected fr’om various sources, shows the relative results of primaiy and secondaiy operations in civil practice.

While the percentage of deaths after primary amimtation of the thigh exceeds that after secondary amputation, the rate of mortality in amputations of the leg, fore-ai-m, and arm is gi-eater after the secondary than after the primary operation, especially iu the upper limb. Primary amputation of the thigh is, indeed, one of the most fatal operations in Smgery. Thus of 40 cases of primaiy amputation recorded by Malgaigne, 34 perished ; of 18 cases in the Massachusetts Hospital at Boston diu’ing the fi^•e yeai’s 1863— 1868, lo died ; 9 cases out of ten died at the London Hospital dining the years 1863 1866 ; and of 24 cases recorded by South, Lawi'ie, and Peacock, as occuiTing at St. Thomas’s Hosjiital, the Glasgow Infhmary, and the Edinbiu’gh Infhmary, every one pierished. The danger of amputation of the thigh for injiuy is increased in proportion to the height at which the limb is severed. It is least in those cases where the operation is done for injury of the leg or knee-joint, and greatest when it is performed for compound fi’acture of the femiu’, recovery ft’om which is very rare. This excess of mortality after primary amputation of the thigh must be referred mainly to the intensity of the shock, whether produced by the operation itself, or, more often, by the injiuy which has rendered its performance necessary. The sudden distiu’bance of the balance in the supply of blood, caused by the removal of so large a portion of the body, may also contribute to the danger. In primary amputations of the leg, arm, and fore-arm, howei'er, the influence of these causes is relatively less, while in secondary amputations of these parts, as well as of the thigh, shock is much less intense. In these, the chief danger arises from py®mia, gangrene, diffuse inflammation, secondary htemoirhage, and all those morbid conditions that are favom'ed by defective hygienic circumstances, and which apj)ear to exercise a more luiifoimly unfavourable influence over the secondary amputations than shock does over the primary. The foUomng are the main causes of death after amputations, as pubhshed in the Beports of four Metropolitan Hospitals up to 1871. In 187 primary amputations, 90, or 48'6 per cent., died ; of these 90 deaths, 21 occiured from shock, and 30 from pyasmia. In 84 secondary amputations, 50, or 59*5 per cent., and of these oidy 3 perished from shock, wliilst 22 were the victims of lyiemia. In 350 amputations for disease, 98, or 27'4 per cent., died ; of these none were destroyed by shock, but 34 by pytemia.* In military practice, secondary amputation is, in general, more fatal than primary. Thus, Faiu'e saved only 30 out of 300 secondary ampntatioiis, whilst LaiTey saved thi'ee-foiu’ths of those in which he amputated primarily. In the Peninsular war, the mortality after secondary amputation of the upper extremity was tivelve times, and after secondary amputation of the lower limb, three times, as great as after primary amputation of these parts. In the British army in the Crimea, fr'om the 1st of'April to the close of the war, the relative rates of mortality per cent, after primary and secondary amputations were as follow:—after primary amputations at the shoidder, 26 ; of the arm, 17 ; of the fore-arm, 3 ; of the thigh, 62 ; of the leg, 30 ; and of the foot, 17 ; after secondary amputations at the shoulder, 66 ; of the arm, 31 ; ot the fore-arm, 28 ; of the thigh, 80 ; and of the log, 76. Or, for the upper extremity, the whole rate of deaths after primary was 15, against 41 after * “Hns)iit«lism,’’ &c., p. 20.59 GENERAL REVIEW OF CAUSES OF DEATH. secondary amputations ; whilst, for the lower extremity, excluding the foot, it was 46 for the primary, against 78 per cent, for the secondaiy. In the American army during the war of the rebellion, the mortahty after primaiw amputation of the thigh was 54-13 per cent.; and after secondary amputation, 74-70. In the French ai-my in the Crimea, on the other hand, the mortality after primary amputation of the thigh and arm—amounting in the foi-mer limb to above 90 per cent.—was greater than that after the secondaiy operation. • As has already been observed, not only does the rate of mortahty differ in primary and secondary amputations, but also the cause of death. Piimaiy amputations are most frequently fatal from shock, hmmon-hag-e, and exhaus- tion, although death from pyrnmia and secondary diseases of a low tyiie is by no means rare in these cases. Secondary amputations for injiuy most commonly cany off the patient by the supervention of septic diseases. Amongst these secondary affections that are of most fi-equent occunence, gangrene of the stump stands in the first place, especially after traumatic ^putation of the thigh, and more particularly if the limb have been in a similar condition before the amputation. Then, again, erysipelas, phlebitis ■\rith pycemia, secondary haemorrhage, and some of the low forms of visceral inflammation or congestion, as pneumonia, plem-isy, and diarrhoea, often produce death. Pyaemia, complicated by congestive and suppurative pneu- monia, is the most fi-equent cause of death after secondary amputation of the leg and arm. Secondaiy haemorrhage to such an extent as to prove fatal is of very rare occiurence ; when it happens, it is usually associated with some diseased state of the blood interfering \rith the formation of a plastic plug in the ai’tery. SnxrMARY.—On revieAviug the whole subject of the cause of death after- amputations, we cannot but come to the conclusion that the mortality after- amputations is influenced more directly and distinctly than that of any other- operation, except perhaps ovariotomy, by the hygienic conditions to which the patient is subjected after the operation. The evil influences arising fi’om exposure to a\dtiated atmosphere—to those various conditions and combinations of conditions that are summed up under the one general term “ Hosjntalism,” —exercise so important a bearing upon the death-rate after amputation, that, in order to ai-rive at a just estimate of the probable chances of recovery after any given amputation, it becomes necessary not only to consider whether the operation be done for injiu-y or disease—whether it be primary or secondary -^whether the disease be simple or malignant—Avhether the patient be aged or yoimg, healthy or diseased ; but, above all, to consider Avhether, after the removal of the hmb, the patient will be exposed to those conditions that result ft-om the aggregation of the sick and Avounded. For it is on them almost more than on any others that the ultimate result will depend. Whatever explanation Ave may gh'e of the fact, it remains certain and incontrovertible that the rate of mortality after amputation of all limbs in the large city hospitals of Great Britain up to a very recent period has been at least 1 in 3 {vide Table). In those of Paris, out of 1,056 amputations, the statistics of Avhich Avere collected by Malgaigne and Trclat (Simpson), 803 died, or nearly 1 in 2 {vale also Table). The GoA'ernment statistics collected6o AMPUTATIONS. by Bristowe and Holmes_ show that in 18G1 the amputation death-rate in iaiisian hospitals was 3 in 5, and moi’e recently Le Fort gives the mortality at 58 per cent. In Germany matters were not much better. Billroth’s pub- lished amputation-mortality has been from 43 to 4G per cent. In the United States the death-rate is much smaller, however ; the mortality in the Pennsyl- ■\ania Hospital being only about 24 per cent., and that of the Massachusetts General Hospital 26 per cent. In military pi’actice, the result of the experience deduced from the mor- tality following amputations dining the great modem wars is at least equally nntavoinable. But here there are so many modifying and distinbing elements, that it may be well to exclude these cases from consideration. In fact, then, on taking the average mortality after amputation of aU foin limbs in the largest hospitals in the great centres of civilisation, we come to this result, that it commonly varied fi-om GO to 35 per cent., and did not fall beloAv 24 per cent. ; and that in certain of the larger amputations, as in the upper third of the thigh and at the hip-joint, it ran up to from 70 to 90 per cent. Widely extended statistical returns have shown but too plainly that these figin-es are trustworthy and constant, when founded on sufficient num- bers and carried over a sufficient length of time to eliminate the mfluence of accidental circumstances operating for or against the patient. So constantly do these figmes come out in hospital retmns, that Surgeons had almost come to regard them as representing the necessary, or, so to speak, the natural rate of mortality after amputations. But is this so in reality ? Is this frightful rate of mortality the necessary result of the opera- tion, and thus beyond our control ? oi- is it dependent on causes that are preventable, and that may in great part, if not wholly, be removed ? That it is not necessary—that it is dependent on preventable causes and will eventually be more materially diminished is eiddent from the admirable results that have of late years been obtained by Callender, Lister, Spence, and others, by different methods of treatment, but all ha'ving in view attention to the hygienic condi- tions of the woimd and of the patient. Up to a recent period, Sm’geons have had no opportimity of obtaiuing a knoAvledge of the results of amputations on a large scale, except such as have been furnished by the statistical results obtained from hospitals. It was not until Sir James Simpson collected a large mass of statistics from small country hospitals—fi’om private practice in manufactiu’ing and mining districts espe- cially, where amputations are of common occmrence—that the important fact has been most incontestably and satisfactorily proved, that the high rate of mortahty above given is not by any means the necessary and luiavoidable result of amputation, but that it arises fi'om causes independent of and beyond the operation itself ; that, in fact, it is greatly dependent on the con- ditions to Avhich the patient is exposed after its performanee. Simpson collected the particulars of 2,098 amputations of all kinds ocemTing in country and prfrate practice in tornis ; of these 229 died, or 1 in 9.2; Avhilst of an almost equal number, viz., 2,089 amputations, performed in the large city hospitals of Great Britain, 855 died, or 1 in 2.4. It is quite possible that Simpson’s figmes are not absolutely but only approximately coiTect, aud that certain soiu’ces of fallacy ham intruded them-6i EFFECT OF SEPTIC INFLUENCES. selves more especially regard to the condition ot the patient ipfore the operation, to whieh undoubtedly gi-eat importance must he attached {vide p 50) But stiU, making full allowauee for all this, the difference is so pe Ltween the tivo sets of cases, that the material result, viz., that the mortality after amputation in hospital practice was nearly fom- times as great as when the same operations are perfoi-med out of hospital, caimot very mateipdly he affected, and we cannot escape from the conclusion that the high hospi al mortality was gveatly influenced hy the exposm-e of the patient to those septic conditions existing in the air of large hospitals, which have been so ably and graphically described by Parkes, and which exercise the most in3unous toxic effect on patients ^vith large Avouiids who are exposed to theni. That those septic influences which are generated ^ in, and winch may even- tually saturate hospitals, exercise a most important influence in causing fatal pyemia, septiciemia, and osteo-myelitis after amputations, fiom vhich, as has already been shown, a large proportion of the amputated die, is evident from the following considerations. 1. Fi'om the commencement of this ceiitiny up to a comparatively recent period—dining what, in fact, may be termed the pre-sanitary age no improve- ment had taken place in amputation-mortality in hospitals. 2. The prevailing high rate of mortality varied greatly in different hos- pitals in the same town, in Avhich the patients AA'cre of the same class of society, foUoAAnd pretty much the same occupations, and were subjected to the same kinds of injuries and diseases ; the hospitals beuig officered by Surgeons of equal professional skill, and the only inequality existing being in the different sanitary conditions to which the patients were exposed in different hospitals. 8. The difference in the amputation mortality in different London hospitals A-aried from 18 and 25 to 47 per cent. In Calcutta, the death-rate after thigh amputations varied in different hospitals from 42 to 80 per cent. (DoAA'iiie). 4. Of late years, this excessL'e amputation-mortality has been materially reduced in some hospitals. 5. This reduction is contemporaneous with, and, as all the other conditions continue as heifore, dependent upon, the greater attention paid to hospital hygiene and the employment of antiseptics, under the improved sanitary Anews that are now entertained by Siu’gcons. 6. In mihtary practice, the rate of mortality after amputation has been found to be in the direct ratio of the aggregation of the Avoinided ; and death from septic influences may almost, if not entirely, be averted by their isolation.SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. 62 CHAPTEK III. —*— SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. There are, as has already been stated at p. 85, three distinct methods of amputating limbs, viz., the flap, the circular, and the oval. The choice of the method mfluences the shape, and to a certain degree, perhaps, the utility of the residting stump. But it in no way affects the safety of the patient, which is dependent on far different and far more important conditions than the manner in which the Surgeon shapes his incisions for the removal of the diseased or injiu-ed limb (p. 49). A skilful Surgeon will be able to produce a satisfactory stmnp by auy one of the three methods, and it is desirable that he shoidd be able to practise all. For although, as a general rule, one method may be more apj)licable than another, yet exceptional cases occur at times in which it may be advantageous to depart from the method usually adopted, and employ one of the others. In fact, a Surgeon should be eclectic in his method of ampu- tating, and select that which is most suitable to the circiunstances of the case before him. As a general rule, the flap method is that to which Surgeons give the preference in this country ; it is- that which I generally employ, and if.is, therefore, that which, noth few exceptions, I consider most useful. It is the method, therefore, Avhich I shall describe in this chapter. In describing this or any other method of amputating, precise rules may be laid doA\Ti for its performance through sound structiu’es. But it often hap- pens, especially in cases of injmy, that the destruction of tissue is so UTegular as to compel the Surgeon to depart from deflnite rules of practice, and to shape his flap as best he may from the uninjimed soft parts. There he must rely on his own judgunent. But so efficient is the moulding process of natin-e, that provided sufficient integumental covering be left on the muscles and bones, a stump that at first looks very in-egular and perhaps somewhat unsm’gical, will in a short space of time acquire a regular outfine and smooth surface, and will be eventually in all respects as useful as one that may fr’om the first have been fashioned more artistically. Amputations of the Hand.—The Fingers often require amputation for injury or disease, more especially as the result of bad whitlow. In many cases the ungual phalanx becomes necrosed, and may usually most readily be removed without amputation, by making an incision through the pulp of the finger and then extracting the diseased bone, thus saving the nail and pulp, which will form an excellent end to the finger ; and, if the operation be done in early childhood, a new and movable phalanx may form. In other cases, amputation will bo required. This may either be done by cutting into the joint from its dorsal aspect with a naiTow-bladed bistoury, nuining across it lightly, touching* the latoi’al ligaments, and making the flap fr’om the palmar txspect (Fig. IG); or the flap may conveniently be made fr'oin the palmar surface by transfixion.63 AMPUTATION OF FINGER. and then cutting across the joint (Fig. 17).* In doing this, care must he taken to avoid cutting too for backwards, and so mistaking the depression Fig. le.—Amputation of Part of a Finger by Cutting from Above. above the head of the second phalanx for the articulation, which would lead to Fig. 17.—Amputation of a Finger.

In operating from the palmar aspect, the finger should be forcibly extended as soon as the flap is made, when, it the knife be applied to the lateral ligaments, the synoAial siu-face will show itself. Amputation is performed between the proximal and second phalanges m the same way ; but, as a general rule, it should not be done here ; because, as no flexor tendon is attached to the proximal phalanx, it is apt to remain pciina- nently extended, and a good deal in the patient’s way. In the case ot the index finger, however, it will be better to leave the proximal phalanx, the stump of which forms an usefril opponent to the thumb.65 21 ETA GA RPO-PHA LA NGEA L A RTIC ULA TIOK. Amputation is frequently required at the Metacarpo-plialangeal Articu- lation. Here it may be done in two ways : either by lateral flaps, or by the oval I'ig. 19.—Araputation of tlie Imlex Finger Removing the Head of the Metacarpal Bone method.

This same process is performed upon the opposite side, the flaps are dissected down by a few touches of the knife, the extensor tendon is divided, the joint opened, and disarticulation performed. The oval method, which I think is the best, as it does not wound the palm, consists in entering the bistoury at the same point as in the last case, carrying it as far as the web, di’aAving it across the palmar aspect of the finger, and then obliquely backwai’ds to join the starting point of the incision. By a fcAv touches of the point of the knife the oval flap is turned back, and the ai-ticulatiou opened. Fig. 23.—Amputation of Left Tliumb and Metacaipal Bone. As a general rule, it is better to remove the head of the metacarpal bone, together mth the finger ; as othervdse a wide gap aaoU be left in the situation of the finger that has been amputated, and much deformity of the hand Avill result. This may be done by cutting the metacarpal bone across beyond its head with bone-forceps in a transA’erse direction, if it be either the middle or the ring finger that is removed (Fig. 18). If it be the index or the little fingei, the bone should be cut obliquely irom without inwards, so as to shape it to the tapering form of the hand (Fig. 19). This may be done either with the bone- forceps or Avith a siunll saAV. The saw has the advantage ot making a smoother section and of leaving no splinters. If it be cut directly across, an ugly and incouA'cnient square protuberance, liable to constant injury, A\dll be left. II hen, hoAvever, the patient’s employment is one in Avhich great strength and bieadth of hand are required, and where appearauce is ot little consequence, the head of the bone may advantageously remain.AMPUTATION OF THE THUMB. 67 The affcci’-trcafcmeiit of tlieso cases is extremely simple. The hand should be ]nit upon a splint, the u'ound covered with a piece of water-dressing, and the ends of the fingers, until small pieces of lint interposed, tied together by means of a tape, care being taken, however, that they do not overlap. The shaft of the metacarpal bone that is left will gTadually atrophy, and thus a very taper jind shapely hand eventually be left (Figs. 20, 2.1, 22). In disease or injury of the Thumb as little as possible should be removed by Fig. 2-i.—Amputation of Riglit Tlmmli by Transfixion.

When the whole thumb requires amputation, it may most conveniently be removed by Liston’s method. The mode of proceeding must A ary according to the side operated on. When the Jpft thumb requires amputation, the jioint of a long narrow bistoiuy shoidd be introduced well on the palmar aspect of the carpo- metacarpal articulation, carried* over this, which it opens (Fig. 2u), and the dorsum of the hand as far as the Aveb of the index finger ; the point of the knife shordd then be pushed downwards through the ball of the thumb, transfixing this and issuing AAdrere the incisiorr commenced.

The Metacarpal Bones, with or Avithont the fingers supported Ijy thenv oc«asionally require remoA al for disease or injury. For these operations, Avhich are not of a A'ery regular kind, it is difficult to lay doAvn definite rules ; in perfonning them, care should be taken to make good square flaps of sufficient size, but to aA'oid cutting into the palm if possible. It is Avell not to dis- articulate the lower end of the bone, so as to open the Avrist- joint, but rather to cut it off AAlth bone-forceps a little aboA'e this. In injuries from the exiAlosiou of poAvder-flasks or gun-baiTels,when the hand is much shattered, it is of gToat consequence to aA’oid cutting up the palm to too great an extent; and it is AA'ell in these cases to saA'O a finger if possible, AAdiich will be of more use to the patient than any artificial limb, however ingeniously constructed (Figs. 20 and 27). When only one finger is left, as the index or little finger, AAdth the thmnb, in cases of partial amputation of the hand after injury or for disease, the digit that remains not only becomes more mobile than tonnerly, but gTeatly increased in size and much stronger’, so that its ntihty is materially augmented. The mortahty after amputation of the fingers and metacarpal bones is A'ery trifling. Should death rmfortunately occirr after such a slight operation, it woidd probably be by the accidental occruT-ence of some general disease, such as erysipelas, pyaemia, or tetanus, to which eA'ei’y wound renders a patient liable. An excellent strmrp may in some cases be obtained by amputating betAA'eeu the carpus and metacarpus. All the movements of the AA iist-joint remaining perfect, a A'ery rrsefrd artificial hand carr be easily applied. Amputation at the Wrist is not very ofteir reqrrired. In performing: disarticrrlatiorr at this joint, its pecrrliar shape, AA-itlr the corrAexity looking upwards, must be borne in mind. The operation may be performed in two Avays, the chief flap being errt either from the dorsal or palmar srrrfiice. In the first case, it is best performed by Teah's method (Fig. 28). A perfecHy square flap, whose form sides are equal in length to half the circimrference ot the limb at the level of the AA-r’ist-joint, is raised irom the back of the hand. It mrrst consist of skin arrd fat only, the extensor tendons being left on the hand. A short palmar flap, also composed of skin and fat only, and eqrral m length to one-qrrarter of the dorsal flap, is now raised. The extensor tendons may now be diA'idcd at the level of the Avrist, and the joint opened and dis- articulated. Lastly, both flaps being held Avell back, the flexor tendons aic smoothly diA'ided with a single SAveep of the knife. The flaps must be brong iAMPUTATION AT THE WRIST. 69 Accurately together in the way described on p. 41, Fig. 11. By this metliod the dorsal flap is somewhat long and thin, and is consequently liable to slough, unless Fig. 2S.—Ainxmtatiou of tlio Wrist ty Tealc's JletUoil. it be very caicfully raised, care being taken not to turn the edge of the knife to the flap, but to keep it constantly directed towards the parts to be removed. In amputation by the long palmar flap, the operation has been performed, -either by cutting the flap from within ■or by shaping the flap from the pahn first and disarticulating afterwards. The former method is objectionable, as the prominence of the pisiform bone and the hook of the unciform ■on the inner side render its per- formance extremely difficnlt. In the latter method (Fig. 29) a large flap, almost square in shape, but having its angles rounded off, is marked out in the palm by an incision, com- mencing at one styloid process and terminating at the other. The flap should extend as far as the trans- verse fold in the pahn opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones. The flap liaA'ing been thus marked out, it is carefully raised ftom the palm, and is made to include e\-erything down to the flexor tendons. When the pahnar flap has been raised to tlie level of the wrist-joint, a curved incision, with its convexity slightly dowmivards, is made, so as to connect the two extremities of the previous incision. The joint is now opened. pards alter opening the wrist-jomt. Fig. 29.—Amputiitioii at tlie Wrist by Long Falninr Fl.ap and the ligaments divided. The hand70 SPECIAL AMPUTA TIG NS. is attached now only by the flexor tendons, which may be di\-ided by a snu-le sweep of the knife—the palmar flap being carefully held out of tlie w^y. he palmar flap will be found usually to contain the median and ulnar nerves and the superficial palmar arch, with portions of the muscles of the thumb and little finger. It is better to cut the two nerves short, in order to pre^-ent their implication in the cicatrix. A-MPUTATlOlf OF THE AEjM.—Amputation of the Pore-arm is not un- frequently required for disease or injury of the wrist or hand. In perfonning: this operation, as long a stump should be left as possible, so as to giA’e the patieut more power o-s'cr any artificial limb that may be fitted to it. The flaps should be about a couple of inches in length, and well rounded, the hand being placed in a mid-state between pronation and supination. The dorsal flap is best made by cutting from without in- wards ; the line of incision com- mences just at the pahnar aspect of the ulna, is carried forward for a little distance parallel to this bone, and then across the back of the aim in a slightly cunud manner, until it Fig. 30.-Amimtation of the Fore-arm. Transfixion I’e^l^heS the palmar aspect of the of the ^Interior Flap. I’achus ; it then passos along this. until it reaches a point opposite to that at which it commenced, and the flap thus made is dissected back. The pahnar flap is next made by transfixion (Fig. 30). As soon as it is cut, the bones are cleared by a couple of sweejis. of the knife, and the interosseous membraue is dmded; the bones are then sa^ni together. The vessels are cut long at the end and on each side of the- pialmar flap. When the pahnar flap is formed by transfixion in amputation of the fore-ami, considerable inconvenience is often caused by the protrusion of the mass of tendons and muscles included in it. To avoid this, both flaps may bo made by cutting from ivithout inwards. It is advisable to make the dorsal flap a little- longer than the pahnar, so that the line of the cicatrix may fall iveU away from the ends of the bones. The operation may be thus peifomied (Fig. 31). The Sm-geon, standing so as to take the flaps in his left hand, and holding tho arm Avith its dorsal surface upwards, enters the knife at the pahnar edge of the- bone fru'thest from him. He then marks out a flap from the dorsal surface, equal in length to two-thirds of the antero-posterior diameter of the limb at the point Avhere it is intended to saw the bones. The flap must be sufficiently broad, and rounded at its corners. After raising this, taking only the skin and fat, a flap similar in shape, but half the length, may be raised from the palmar sirnface in the same way. The knife is noAV fiiTuly sivept round the bones at the level of tho- angle of the flaps (Fig. 31), so as to divide the muscles circularly at this point. The soft parts are noAV to be retracted from the bones by a process of carefulAMPUTATIOX OF THE FORE-ARM.

It may be found, ni retracting the muscles from the bones, that the anterior interosseous72 HFECIAL AMPUTA TIDES. artery lias been cut in more than one jilace. Tins may cause some trouble in securing it. Great care should therefore be taken to avoid the accident, by keeping the edge of the knife constantly turned towards the part to be re- moved. If the median and ulnar nerves are seen to be cut somewhat long, they should be pulled out udth forceps, and cut short, so as to avoid if possible their implication in the cicatrix near the end of the bone. Amputation of the Arm is most readily performed by lateral flaps made by transfixion from before backwards ; the bone is then well cleared by a couple of sweeps of the knife, and saum across. In clearing the bone, care must be taken fairly to divide the musculo-spiral nerve by a firm sweep of the knife round the back of the bone (Fig. 32), if the amputation be performed in that part of the arm where this nerve winds round the humerus. If the limb be very muscular, skin-flaps and circular section of the muscles will probably gi^-c the best residt. Amputation at the Shoulder-joint may be required for injury of the arm or for disease of the humerus ; in the first case it is best performed by transfixion; in the other, by cidtimj from loitlmd inwards. Hiemon-hage during the operation may be prevented effectually by compressing the sub- clavian artery as it passes ov’er the first rib; though, if the assistant be steady and well acquainted with his duties, this even may be dispensed with. The precautions above described for iireventing loss of blood dming the operation, are quite sufficient in most cases. But if the Siu-geoii have no assistants on whom he can rely, Esmarch’s India-rubber compressor may be applied. After bandaging the limb uith an elastic bandage, a large pad should be put in the hollow above the clavicle so as to press on the subclavian artery. The compressor is then jiassed under the axilla and crossed once over the shoulder, and its two ends pulled on strongly by two assistants. It is difiicult to keep it in place after disai’ticulation, but this is possible if it be put on sufficiently high up, so as to embrace the scapula. In operating by transfixion, a long narrow-bladed knife should be used. One assistant must have charge of the limb ; another should raise the flap ; and a third must follow the knife as it cuts behind the humerus, and gxasp the inner flap with the axillary artery, so as to prevent hmmonhage frnm this vessel. An assistant holding the arm away from the body, so as to relax the deltoid somewhat, the knife, instead of being entered by a punctiue, should make a small cross-cut, about an inch in extent, at the point at which trans- fixion is to be made, so as to prevent that jaggmg of the integuments by the heel of the instrument which would otherwise occur. If the operation be on the rifjht side, the Sm-geon stands before the patient, and the point of the knife should be entered about au inch in front of the acromion, or midway between the acromion and the coracoid process (Fig. 33) ; and being canled directly across the joint and capsule, should pass out at the posterior border of the axilla. If on the hft side, the Surgeon stands behind, and the iioint of the knife must be entered well behind the spine of the scapula, at the postei’ior Ijorder of the axilla, carried across the anterior aspect of the joint, and brought out to the outer side of the coracoid process. In either case, tlie^ large flap containing the deltoid muscle must then be cut by a sweep oi the knife73 AMFUTATIOX at the SHOULDER-JOINT. (lowinvards, and, as soon as made, raised by the assistant. The heel of the knife is }io\v to be laid on the head of the bone, the capsule of the joint cut across, and the attachments of the muscles to the tuberosity dinded. In order Fig. 33.—Amputatiou at tlie Shoulder-joint hy Transfixion. to facilitate this part of the operation, it is generally recommended that the arm should be carried forcibly Inwards across the chest. This may readily be done in the dissecting-room, or in actual practice where the limb is removed for disease of the humerus, the bone being entire ; but in the case of com- minuted fractine of the humerus, Avith extensiA'e laceration of soft parts, it is useless to attempt this manoeuATe. In cases of this kind, the head and upper end of the humerus being broken off from the shaft, the lever-like action of the bone cannot be put in force, and it is sometimes not such an easy matter as might at fii’st appear, to detach its head from the glenoid caAity. In order to do this, I liaA’e in cases of comminuted fr'acture of the humerus, in Avhich I A\as amputating at the shoulder-joint, found it necessary, after opening the capsule, to seize hold ol the upper fragment and to draAV it forcibly doAviiAvards and outAvards by inserting the fingers betAA’een the head and the glenoid cavity, in order to divide the muscles inserted into it. After the head of the bone has been turned out of the glenoid caA'ity, the knife must be passed behind it, and cari'icd doAvn for a distance of about three inches close to the bone at its inner side (Fig. 34). The Singeon then cuts across the soft parts, so as to ioim the inner flap. In doing this, the assistant, to AAdiom this part is entrusted, must folloAV the knife with his hands, grasping firmly the aa’IioIo thickness of ttie inner flap, so as to compress the axillary artery, and thus prevent theSPECIAL AMPUTA TIONS. 74 occuiToncG of hfomorrhage (Fig. 35).

Am^ndation at Shoulder hi/ Oval Blethod.—In cases in which, from the state of the bone, the mam'pulations necessary for amputation by transfixion arc im- possible, the method originally invented by Lan-ey, or some modification of it, must be adopted. Larrey commenced his operation by a vertical incision doum to the bone, about two inches in length, commencing immediately below the acromion j^rocess. From the end of this he made a cmwed incision on each side, reaching to the coiTesponding fold of the axilla. The two flaps thus Fig. 34.—Amputation at the Shoulder-joint.

The operation was completed by dividing the tissues in the axilla, between the ends of the ttvo cimved incisions preA'iously made to its bordem. The most important modification of this method is that of Spence, vhich is specially adapted for gun-shot u’ounds of the upper end ot the hmnerus. It consists in canying the A'ertical incision fimther fonvards, and commencing it just extenially to and below the tip of the coracoid process, as in excision otAMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER-JOINT. 75 the slioulcTer-joiiit.

The outer flap is then dissected up, so as to enable the Sm’geon to get his knife internal to the head of the bone, between it and the axillaiy arteiy (Fig. 37). The assistant follows the knife with his hands, and grasps the I'essels, and the operation is finished by dividing the tissues left imcut at the ini\er side. In those cases in Avhich this operation is peiformed for disease, especially for timionr of the humenis, by which the soft parts arc thinned or condensed, it may very conveniently be done liy making tlie anterior flap by dis- secting it up fr’om without inwards, using of course for this pmiiose a short knife ; a broad bistoury is most convem’ent.

In the Crimea, amputations of the fore-arm were fatal in the ratio of 5, and those of the arm ot per cent. The table at p. 50, in the last chapter, gives a mortality of Fig. 37. —Amputation at Shoulder hy Spence’s Metliod. S4'4 per cent, for traumatic amputations of the upper arm, and of 10’5 per ■cent, for amputation of the fore-arm. At Guy’s Hospital, Bryant states that traumatic amputations of the fore-arm were fatal in the ratio of 10, and those •of the upper arm of 22 per cent. At University College, in Liston’s and my practice, of 12 traumatic amputations of the upper arm, there ivere 5 deaths ; whilst of 8 in ivhich the fore-arm was removed, all recovered. The cause of ■death is usually pymmia, erysipelas, or congestive pneumonia. Amputations of the fore-arm and ai’m for disease, more particularly for sti’umous affections of the bones and joints, are A'cry successtul operations. ■When they are done for malignant disease, the risk is greater. In the table already refeiTed to, the mortality after amputation of the arm for disease is 26 per cent., and of the fore-arm 15’9 per cent. Amputation.at the shoulder-joint for injury, although necessarily moic fatal, is very successful for so severe a procedure. In 46 recorded^ cases in ciUl practice, there were 26 deaths, or 56’5 per cent., Avhile of 607 cases in military surgery, 294, or 48'4 per cent., died. In the drench aimy in theAMPUTATION OF THE GREAT TOE. 77 Crimea, of 222 cases, 137 died, or Cr7 per cent. ; while in the English anny during the same war, the mortality was only 35 per cent., and m the war of the \merican rebellion, it was 39-2 per cent. At University College Hospital, I have done the operation six times nitli one fatal result. When this operation proves fatal, the patient usually sinks from exhaustion, or is earned off by tlio extension of erysiiielas or gaiigi'one to the stump and tiTuik. Amputation at the shoulder-joint for disease of the humerus is a very successful procedure, considering the size of the part removed, and its proximity to the trunk.

Ill removing a bone at the Metatarso-plialangeal Articulation, the oval method shoidd always be practised, so that the sole of the foot may not be cut into. In doing this it must be remembered that the articulation is situated considerably above the web of the toes, and the incision must therefore be com- I'ig. 38. - Incision and Position of Joint in Ainputation of a Toe. menced proportionately far backwards (Fig. 38). As a general rule, it will be found that the articulation is about tlie same distance abo\'e the web as the point of the toe is beloAV it. The Metatarsal Bone of the Great Toe occasionally requires removal in whole or in part. The whole of the bone may be readily removed by one of two methods : f, by the flap ; 2, by an oval amputation. ]. The is done as follows. The iioint of a strong broad bistomy is entered on the dorsmn of the foot over the interapace between theSPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. 7S fli-st and second motatol to f„v b„nk as possiUo ; it is then can-ied 011\aids upon the ball ol the great toe, to a point opposite to the ivcb between the toes, and thence made to sink into the sole of the foot in a line parallel to the outer margin of the bone j the flap thim formed is dissected back, its plantar aspect being kept as thick and fleshy as possible (Fig. 30). The Sm-- geon next passes the luiife betM'een the first and second metatarsal bones, and cuts directly forwards through the centre of the angle between the great and the second toes. In doing this, care must be taken that the edge of the knife is not directed too much toM'ards the metatarsal bone of the great toe, lest it hitch against one of the sesamoid bones. The Surgeon next seizes the extremity of the toe, and, pulling ifc well inwards, passes the point of the bistoury deeply into the angle of the wound (Fig. 39), where, by the dbision ■of some tendinous and ligamentous fibres that constitute the key of the joint, he opens the articulation, and detaches the bone by lightly touching its ligamentous attachments. By keeping the edge of the knife well against the side of the bone, he may a^'oid Avomiding the dorsal artery of the foot, the bleeding from which would be troublesome. When the bone is to be partially removed, the operation must be performed in the same way ; the in- cisions, however, not being carried so far backwards. 2. In Amimtation hy the Oval Mefliocl, the point of the bistoury is errtered in the dorsrmr of the foot, just behirrd the tarsal errd of the borre.

The same process is carried on at the outer side, the79 AMPUTATION OF THE MET AT AREAL BONES. blade made to sweep uudcr the bone from Avithout inward, and the tarsal joint opened as described in the flap operation. This process has the ad\'antage of leaving the sole uninjured. It has the disadvantage of lii\-onring an accumulation of sanies and pus at the deeper part of the Avound. 3. If the disease be limited to the anterior part, the shaft of the bone should be cut across Avith a pair of bone-nippers, and its base left; for, as this giA'cs insertion to the pei’oneus longus, its removal Avill materially Aveaken the foot. Tlie Metatarsal Bone of the Little Toe may conveniently be removed by an oval incision, so as to aAmid Avounding the sole of the foot. This is best done by entering the point of the knife just behind the tubercle of the bone, canying it for- Avards and inwards in the hne of its articulation Avith the cuboid, to the centre of the foiu’th digital interspace, and thence forwards to the web of the toe ; the knife is next car- ried round the plantar sinface of this, the incision bemg con- tinued obliquely into that Avhich has been made on the dorsum of the foot (Fig. 41). The small flap thus formed is weU dissected doAvu, the knife passed Toiuid the under sinface of the bone, and the joint opened by the toe lieing forcibly draAvn outwards, and its ligamentous connections lightly divided. The middle metatarsal bones, when diseased, do not admit of separate remoA'al so as to leave a foot that would be useful to a patient. Fig. 41.—Removal of Metatarsal Bone of Little Toe Flap Formed: Boue being cleared. Amputation of the Metatarsus.—When the metatarsus aud anterior part of the foot are extensiA’ely diseased or injured so as to require removal, the amputation may be effected by one of two methods ; auz., 1. By making a flap from the sole and a transverse incision across the dorsum, aud then saAAiug across the metatarsus as a whole aboA'e the seat of injmy or disease ; or, 2. By dis- articulating the metatarsus from the tarsus. The first operation that of saAving through the metatarsus—is usually called Lisfranc s ; but in reality it AA^as practised and described by Hey long before Lisfrauc s time. The operation by disarticulation is that to which Key’s narne is generally attached. He describes the fii’st case as having been peffomied in 1797, and speaks of it as “ a ncAV mode of ojierating, AiBich after repeated trial has fully ansAvered my expectations.” The whole of the Metatarsal Bones may then be remoA'cd from the tarsal by the operation originally planned aud executed by Hey. This consists in first of all making a large comox flap in the sole of the foot, one horn of AAdiich commences at the tubercle of the fifth metatarsal bone, whilst the other terminates at that of the first, or rather one inch in front of the tubercle of the scaphoid. ^ A small flap is then made on the dorsum of the foot and the articulations are exposed. These must then be opened AAuth some especially, being sunk into a kind of pit between the inner and outerSPEC I A L A MP UTA TIONS. cuneiform bones, and the artienlation of the fifth with the cuboid bein<? ACiy oblique. Ihis operation is seldom practised, disease being rarely limited to the metatarsal bones, but usually impheating the joints as well. Their disarticulation also from the tarsus is Tery troublesome, on account of the irregularity of the line of ai’ticulation; hence it is better to saw through the metatarsus just in front of the tareal articulations, than to attempt to disjoint the bones. A combination of these two iDrocedm-es may sometimes be advantageously adopted. In several of those severe crashes of the anterior part of the foot, that are not imfrequently the result of tram or railway injury, and in whiclr the bones and soft parts are- iiTegidarly crashed and torn, I have made a veiy excellent- stump by disarticulating the- first and the fifth metatamal bones, and sawing across the three middle ones almost an inch aaiterior to their articula- tions with the tarsus, or by simply dissecting back the sole of the foot, clearing the bones, and sawing them across at a convenient line.

In operating on the left foot, the knife, a stout bistoury, should be entered well behind the tubercle of the scaphoid, and can’ied forwards for at least three inches to about the head of the metatai'sal bone of the great toe, then right across the sole, and down the outer side of the foot, as far as half an inch behind the metatarsal bone. On the ruiM foot this line of incision is reversed, Fig. 45.—Chopart s Operation. Flap formed after Disarticulation. Fig. 40. 1. Line of Amputation of Great Toe. ‘2. Line of Cliopart’s 0])eration. 3.

This flap should be made long, especially at the hiner side, but well rounded at the angles, and should consist of the Avhole thickness of parts in the sole of the foot, Avhich must be well dissected out fr-om the concaAdty under the metatarsal bones. But in children and young adults, in Avhom the foot is otten long and the tarsus thin, the flap need not be made so long. A convex incision is then made along the dorsum fr-om one horn to the other of the plantar flap ; the parts are well retracted, and the articulations opened by the Surgeon bearing firmly upon the anterior part of the foot, and lightly touching the ligamentous structures Avith the point of his bistoury. In this stage of the operation, care must be taken that the edge of the bistoury be not in- clined too much backAvards, lest it slip over the astragalus and open the ankle- joint ; or too far forwards, lest it pass anterior to the scaphoid—betAA^een it and the cuneiform bones. After disarticnlation has been produced, the pro-SPECIAL AMPUTA TIG NS. 82 jectiiig head of the astragalus and the articular surface of the os calcis should be sami oli. In more than one instance, I have found firm osseous anlcylosis existing in the line of articidations, so as to require the use of the saw for the separation of the anterior j>art of the foot. When this complication occurs, the tarsus should be treated as a Avholc, and sawn through, iiTespective of articula- tions, behind the limits of the disease. The result of this operation is ex- tremely fa's Durable, the patient, by the aid of a properly constructed boot, being able to 'ss alb, and even dance, ■with very little appearance of lameness. In some cases, where the muscles of the calf are very strong, and the calcaneum projects, the heel becomes di-a-svn up, and the end of the stump made to point down in such a way that the patient is rendered lame by walkmg on the anterior sharp edge of the calcaneiun, which imtates the flap. This condition is best removed by division of the tendo Achillis. Disarticulation of the Foot at the Ankle-joint was first reduced by Syme to a regular operation. By its performance amputation of the leg may often be avoided, the patient being left -ssuth an exceed- ingly useful stump, which, as its covering is in- geniously taken from the heel, constitutes an excellent basis of support. Syme’s words as to the direction of the incision are : “ The foot being held at a right angle to the leg, the point of the knife is introduced immediately below the malleolar lu’ojection of the fibula, rather nearer its ijosterior than anterior edge, and then carried across the bone, slightly inclining back- wards, to the iimer side of the ankle, where it terminates at the point exactly opiJOsUe its. commencement ” (that is, a little below and behind the internal malleolus). “ The extremi- ties of the incision thus formed are then jouied by another passmg in front of the joint. The operator next proceeds to detach the flap from the bone” (Fig. 47). The object of carrying- the incision so far back is, that the dissection of the flap may commence from the most pro- minent point of the plantar surface of the os calcis, that is to say, from the anterior paid of the two tuberosities of that bone. Every eighth of an inch in front of this point increases thp difficulty of raising the flap. The lateral ligaments should be touched Avith the point of the bistoiuy, and the tendo Achillis dn'ided by pressing the foot forcibly downwards and cutting from before backAvards. By twisting and dissecting at the same time the os calcis is completely separated ft’om its soft attachments, and the foot remoAcd(Fig. 4h); the Wo malleoli must then be saAAui off (Fig. 50), the arteries tied, and the flaj) brought up. A Avell-formed rounded stump Avill thus be left. In performing this operation, care must be taken that no button-hole apei tines be made through the posterior part of the heel flap. This may commonly ic Fig. 47. —Syine’s Ainiiutiition of tlie Foot.

It is also of importance that the incision across the heel should be canied Avell back over its pomt (Fig. 49). Unless this be done, a large cup-shaped flap ■will be left, in ■which blood and pus -will accumulate, and the cicatiisation of the stump ■will be much retarded. As imion takes place by granulation, there ■will be a tendency to bagging in the stump ; but this may be prevented by proper bandaging. The tendency to sloughing and to undue sup- piu’ation chiefly occurs in those cases in ■ft'hich the amputation has been performed .. „ , „ fig. 48.—Sjmie’s Amputation of tlie foot, as a prnuary operation for a crush of the Anterioi' incision and flisarticAation. foot. In one case in ■which I had occasion to perform it for an injuiy of this kind, a good deal of trouble resulted from this cause, though eventually the case did perfectly well, and the j)atient now walks with scarcely any difficulty. It has been frequently stated that it is necessary, in order to ensure the vitality of the flap, to cut the posterior tibial artery “ as long as possible,” and it is this as much as anything that has led to the production of the huge cup-shaped flaps which are so difiicult to dissect off the os calcis and which so often slough. A careful Anide-joint. examination of the vascular supply of the flap ■^rill show at once that the posterior tibial artery may be cut close to the base of the flap, ■\rfthout in the least interfering mlh the chief vessels supplying it. The distribution of vessels to the part is as follows. On the outer side, the peroneal arteiy, after giving off the an enor peroneal, is eontinued do^wn along the posterior aspect of the fibula to the outer side of the os calcis. On the inner side a branch of considerable s^e anses from the postenor tibial artery, about one-and-a-half to two inches aboxe the ankle-]omt, and passes down to the inner side of the os calcis running behind the inner malleolus and accompanying the small cutanemis nerve from the posterior tibial to the sldn of the heel.

It IS upon these anastomosing loops that the \-itality of the flap depends more than upon anything else ; and as they lie much nearer the bone than the skin it is evident that, imless the knife be kept hard upon the bone during the whole dis- section of the flap, they will be divided in large numbers, gTeatly endangeidng its vitality. In the operation as j>er- formed by Syme, the dissection of the flap is commenced from the most prominent part of the tuberosi- ties of the os calcis, and the knife can be kept in constant con- tact "with the bone vuth the greatest ease. If, on the contrary, the flap extend far into the sole of the foot in front of the tuberosities of the os calcis, it is almost impossible to dissect it back without the point of the knife being directed into the under surface of the flap and the vascular loops being divided. All the above-mentioned vessels can be readily <lissected out in any well injected foot in the dissecting-room. This operation is a most useful one in all cases requiring removal of the whole foot. The mortahty attending it is but small. I ha^s'e never known a fatal case. The stump that is left admits of good pressiue being exercised directly upon it, without tenderness or fear of ulceration. Various modifications of Syme’s amputation may at times be practised with advantage, in consequence of the soft parts covering the heel being more or less ulcerated or disorganised, so as not to admit of forming a good basis of support. In these circumstances, the fiaps may be fashioned fr’om the sides instead of fr-om behind ; and in this way I have more than once formed an excellent covering to the end of the stump. These lateral flaps should not, hov er ei, be made in any case that admits of disarticulation at the ankle in the oidinaiy way. They never afford so good a basis of support as the integuments of the heel, which are far more dense and elastic. Pirogoff’s Amputation is characterised by the preservation of the posterior portion of the os calcis. The operation is performed in the following way. An in- cision is can’ied across the sole of the foot fr’om the tip of the external malleolus to the corresponding point on the other side. This incision should not be made Fig. 50.—Syiiie’s Amputation of tlie Foot.

Disarticulation of the astragalus is then effected in the usual way, by an inci- sion across the front of the foot. The foot is now forcibly extended to the greatest possible extent, and a common saw is applied immedi- ately behind the astragalus, and the bone cut obliquely downwards and forwards, so that the saw should come out immediately behind the articulation of the os calcis with the cuboid (Fig. 52) ; the malleoh are then removed, and a thin shoe of the tibia noth the articular cartilage taken olf (Fig. 53). The ojDposed osseous siu’faces must then be accimately ad- justed, the movable flap w'ell supported by a broad strip of plaster, and the limb laid on the outer side, -with the knee placed so as to take off' the tension of the teiido Achillis. The advantages O of the long oblique section of the os calcis over the shorter almost vertical cut originally made by Pirogoff are, as Busk has pointed out, that a larger sm-face of bone is brought into contact with the sawn ends of the bones of the leg, that the remaining piece of bone does not require to be tilted so much on its own axis, and that consequently the tendo Achillis is not put so much on the stretch, and that the thick skin of the heel, naturally in contact with the groinid, still serves as the basis of sup- port instead of the thin skin of the back of the heel, which is turned downwards in the other method. The advantages of this operation over the ordinary mode of disarticulation consist in the stump being longer, to the extent of the thick- ness of the portion of the os calcis left in it, and being better- adapted for pressLU’e (Fig. 54) ; in the readiness of the union of the two apphed osseous sm-faces ; and in the less likelihood of the supply of blood to the j)Osterior flap being iutemrpted, as its vascular communications are not much distm’bed. These p1ro7otf'T’inuputa^ advantages are not, however, always real, and are in some degree counter-balanced by the liability to recurrence of disease in the portion of the os calcis left in those cases in rvhich the amputation is done for disease. T^Tren it is practised for iujiuy, however, this objection does not hold good. Another objection which has been raised against this operation, consists in the supposition that the section of two osseous siufaces exiroses the patient to increased risk of osteophlebitis and pyaemia. In the first case in Avhich I peribrmed this amputation the patient, a healthy lad, whose foot was removed for injm-y, died from this cause. But subsequent and extended experience has convinced me that there is no special liability to pyaemia after Pirogoff’s amputation. After its perfoi-mance, jeatients can run ; which they cannot do after amputa- tion of the leg in any part. Fig. 53.—Pirogoff’s Amputation. Ap- jiearance of Paits after Eemoval of nalleoli.87 AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. The Subastragaloid Amputation is another mode of disarticulating the foot. In it the heel-flap is made as in Symo’s operation, and, the articulation between the astragalus and scaphoid being opened (the aukle-]Oint lett intactj, the bistoury is passed under the astragalus, between it and the calcauemn, which together with the rest of the foot is removed. In this amputation a good, long, useful stump results ; but the cases requiring it must be tew as it does not often happen that there is disease of the calcaneum toge ei with the anterior range of tarsal bones, without the astragalus also being involved. . . In cases of caries of the tai-sus requiring amputation, it occasionally hap- pens that the Surgeon cannot determine with certainty whether the morbid action is limited to the anterior range ot tarsal bones, or extends so fai back- wards as seriously to implicate the astragalus and calcaneum ; and he is consequently unable to decide whether the condition of the foot admits^ ot removal by Chopart’s operation, or requires disarticulation at the ankle-joint. In these circumstances all doubt will be cleared, and the proper operation per- formed, by making an incision across the dorsum of the foot in the hue of the iistragalo-scaphoid and calcanco-cuboid articidatioiis ; these are then opened, and the state of the bones is examined. If the astragalus and calcaneum be .sound, or but slightly diseased on their anterior aspect, Chopart’s operation may be done, and any carious bone left behind gouged away. It^ on the con- trary, these bones be found to be deeply implicated, the flap may be dissected back for about an inch, and disarticulation at the ankle-joint proceeded with. It may also be well to bear in mind that the tarsal articulations may have become so ankylosed, as the result of old disease, as to require the application of the saw, instead of opening the joints by the knife. Results.—The amputation of a toe, of a metatarsal bone, or even of a portion of the metatarsus, is but very seldom attended by fatal consequences. Should death occiu, it must be the result of an accidental attack of tetanus, erysipelas, or of pyaemia. Disarticulation at the ankle-joint, though neces- sarily somewhat more dangerous, is yet one of the most successful operations in Siugery, the mortality attending it being but very small. Ajiputatiox of the Leg- may be performed in three situations: either just below the knee, in the middle, or in the lower third of the limb. The selection of the line of amputation must depend in a great degree upon the extent of the disease or injury, but, whenever practicable, the operation should be performed low down ; the mortahty diminishing in proportion as the limb is'removed neai- to the ankle. Of 100 amputations in this situation done in Paris, there were only 13 deaths. Siugeoiis used formerly, even where the disease or injury Avas limited to the foot, to amputate immediately below the knee, in all those cases in Avhich the patient Avould be obliged to wear a com- mon Avooden pin, the long leg-stimip being highly inconvenient when the patient rested on his bent knee ; Avhereas, in those individuals Avho could afford the expense of a Avell-constructcd artificial limb, the amputation, Avhen inacticable, Avas done in the loAver part of the log. But this difficulty has been remoA’cd by the introduction of a short Avooden pin, iu the socket of AAhich the stump may be fixed in the extended position; and amputation in all admissible cases should consequently, even amongst the poorer classes, beSPEC I A L AMPUTA TIONS. 88 done just below the calf, at the junction of the lower and middle thirds of the limb ; nearer the ankle than this, it is not easy to get a good coA'cring for the bones. Ihe number of arteries divided will dejDcnd upon the situation of the amputation. Holden lays do'wn as a general rule in amputations one inch below the head of the fibula, one main artery only—the popliteal—is divided. At two inches two arteries, the anterior and posterior tibial, are cut. At three inches three arteries, the peroneal, in addition to the two tibials beins? divided. riap Amputation of the Leg may be performed in the following way. Eig. 55.—Amputation of tlie Eiglit Leg. Transfixion of the Posterior Flap. The toiu’uiquet hamng been applied to the artery in the pojiliteal space, the assistant, whose duty it is to retract the flap, takes his stand in this, as in all amputations of the lower extremities, ojjposite to the Smgeon. In the left limb, the point of the knife is entered at the j)osterior edge of the tibia, carried forwards for a distance of one inch and a half to two inches, then across the anterior part of the leg to the posterior border of the fibula, up which the incision is made to extend to a coiTesponding distance. In the right leg the same incision commences on the fibular side of the limb, and terminates on the tibial. The flap thus formed, which should be broad and well rofuided, is next dissected up by a few touches of the point of the knife, and transfixion of the limb is made by passing the blade across behind the bones, from one angle of the incision to the other (Fig. fjo). 1’he iwsterior flap is tlien formed by cutting obliquely downwards and backwards, and should be about three inches long. The bones are next cleared by a double sweep of the knife, and theFLAP AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. 89 interosseous soft parts divided by canying tlie instrument in a ^ Ijctween the bones. In doing this, especial care must be taken not to dnect the edo-e upwards, so as to split either of the tibial arteries, more particularly the aiftcrior • for, as this vessel retracts above the membrane, its ligature, when divided too high, is no easy matter. If the amputation be peiioimed iust below the knee, it is possible that the popliteal trunk may be divided before its bifurcation, and thus one artery only recpiire the ligature. In sawing the bones, the fibula should always be cut first, as otherwise it will be neai^ sme to be splintered. This bone may be best divided on the left side, by sink- ing the hand below the level of the limb, and using the heel of the saw ; and on the rio-ht by holding the hand above the limb, and cutting Avitli the end of the instriment (Fig. 56).

If the limb be vciy muscular, a large pad of the muscles of the calf wiU be left in the posterior flap ; this Avill usually be a good deal in the ivay during treatment; it may slough, and thus interfere Avith proper nnioii. In some cases, I have advantageously removed at one SAveep the greater part of the muscular mass thus left, leaving little more than a skin-flap. In order to avoid redmidaiice of muscle, the best operation consists in forming skin- flaps on the anterior and posterior aspects of the limb, and then making a circular cut through the muscles. This may be done in various Avays accord- ing to the seat of the amputation and the amount of skin available for the formation of flaps.9° SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. ■ In cases of injury immediately above tlie ankle, Teale’s operation (Fis?. 57 a so Figs. 10 and 11, p, 41) can be readily perfoi-med, according to the rules laid Fig. 57.—Teale’s Amputation in the Lower Third of the Log. clown on p. 41. If the soft parts be retracted from the bones for a distance of from an inch to an inch and a half or two inches above the angle of the flaps, all the advantages of Teale’s method can be obtained by making an anterior flap equal in length to the diameter of the hmb almost rectangular in shape, but having the angles rounded off. A very short posterior flap may be cut to meet this by carrying the knife behind the limb somewhat obliquely from one end of the first incision to the other. The soft parts ai'e then retracted and the bone saAvn as high as possible. As in Teale’s method, the flaps should contain all that can be taken from the bones, as in this situation they are someAA'hat liable to slough. Lister reconmiends that the incision should be earned, on the fibular side, as high as the point at which the bone is to be saAvn, as this gi’eatly facilitates the separation of the soft parts. In order to aA'oid unneces- sary Avounding of the anterior tibial artery, Teale recommends that the soft parts shoidd be raised from the interosseous membrane by the finger or thumb nail. In the middle and upper thirds of the leg,-the bones lie more towards the anterior aspect of the limb, and consequently it is not necessary to provide so long an anterior flap in order that the cicatrix may be placed AA^ell behind them. In these situations the anterior flap may bo made equal in length to two-thirds of-the diameter of the limb, and the posterior flap one-half the length of the anterior. The anterior flap should consist, at its lower edge, of skin and lat only, but it should be gradually deepened as it is raised, till at its base it contains almost all the muscle that can be obtained from the front of the limb (Fig. 58). In dissecting up the posterior flap, the limb should be raised so that the Siu'geon can more conveniently see AALat he is doing. It should contain only skin and fat. Both flaps being held AveU out of the Avay, the muscles ain91 TEALE'S AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. „o»- divided circularly, and the soft parts i-aisod from the bones for “ ^taneo of from one and a half to two inches. In doing this, care must be taken not Fig. 58.—Amputation of tlie Leg by Long Anterior and Short Posterior Shin flaps, witli Circular Division of the Muscles. again to wound the anterior tibial artery. Finally, the bones are cleaned and sawn as high as possible. The sharji point of the tibia must be rounded off. In doing this it is well carefully to raise the periosteum with a knife or perios- teal elevator before applying the saw or bone-forceps, as by so doing the tendency to necrosis is somewhat diminished, the periosteum not being torn away to a higher point than that at Avhich the bone is actually sawn. If from any cause there shoidd not be sufficient skin available to form the long anterior flap, the circular operation or the modification of it recom- mended by Liston, as described on p. 40, may be employed instead (see Fig. 0, p. 40). All these operations have the great advantage of getting rid of the hea>7 mass of the muscles of the calf, and that by the long anterior flap secures in addition that the cicatrix shall be well behind the cut ends of the bones, and that there shall be a dependent opening for the exit of the discharges. The long anterior flap tends to keep itself in position by its o^vn weight, and no strapping is required as in the amputation by the long posterior flap, and so a great source of pain to the patient and disturbance to the sUimp92 SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. is avoided. The tendency to'protrusion of the bone is also much less, as the weight of the flap is hardly suflicient to cause ulceration, if the end of the tibia has been carefully rounded. Results. Amputation of the log is, upon the whole, a successful opera- tion. ^ The niortahty, however, varies not only according to the situation at which the limb is removed, but also according as it is done for injury or disease, and the nature of that disease. So far as situation is concerned, it may be stated, as a general rule, that the nearer the knee the greater is the danger. In amputation of the leg for injiuy, the rate of mortality is, upon the whole, lather high. In the Crimea, 37 per cent, of the cases were lost. The table at p. 50 shows an average mortahty in civil practice of 4GT per cent.; the death-rate, however, varies greatly in the records of different hospitals. Thus, at the Edinburgh and Glasgow Infirmaries, and Guy’s Hospital, in an of 224 cases, there were 116 deaths ; while in 353 cases in country hospitals, the number of deaths was 99, and in 60 cases at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, there were 20 deaths. At University College Hospital, the mortality has been 31‘8 per cent. Secondary amputation is more fatal than primary ; the deaths from the former, aecording to the table at p. 57, being 48, and from the latter, 43*9 per cent. After amputation of the leg for disease, the mortality is much smaller ; amounting, on a calculation based on 1281 cases, to 23'5 per cent. The chief causes of death are pyasmia, gangrene of the stump, and exhaustion. Amputation through the Knee-joint, originally recommended in the last centm’y by Hoin, and reintroduced by Velpeau, Markoe, and Brinton, has for some years found favoim in this coimtry and in America. Amputation through the knee-joint may be performed in three different ways : 1, with a long posterior and a short anterior flap ; 2, with a long ante- rior and a short posterior flap ; 3, by lateral flaps. 1. The operation vdth the Long Pos- terior and Short Anterior Flap may be readily performed in the following- way. An incision is made directly across the knee-joint, just below the patella. The skin-flap thus formed is dissected back ; and, the joint being opened above the patella, and the ligaments divided by a few touches of tlie knife, a long posterior flap is cut from the upper j)art of the calf of the leg, by passing the knife behind the tibia, and carry- ing it dovmwards for a suitable distauce (Fig. 59A). 2. The operation by means of a Long Anterior and Short Posterior Flap is thus performed. A long square flap, rounded at the cornel’s, is made by entering the point of a short broad-bladed amputating-knife towards the pos- terior part of one condyle, carrying the incision downwards in a straight line Fig. 59a.—Amputation tlii’ougli the Coiidylos by Long Posterior Flap.amputation through the knee-joint. 93 for four or five indies, then across the limb, and cutting upwards to a point on the opposite side con-esponding to that of entry. The integuments and the patella are then dissected from the front of the joint (Fig. 59). The ai-ticulation is thus opened; the ligaments ai-e then successively didded, the limb being forcibly bent; and a posterior flap is formed by cutting with a determined sweep fr-om behind forwards, or by dis- secting down behind the bones and then cutting backwards. The flap should be about 2^ to 3 inches long. If made shorter than this, it is apt to retract up the back of the thigh. Indeed, in aU cases there is a great tendency to this, even when the flap is of the length above given. The popliteal artery is divided, and, vith the ex- ception of the articular vessels, is the only one requiring ligatui-e. The management of the patella is an important question ; some Siu’geons advocating its removal, and others its preservation. I think that it is decidedly better to leave than to remove this bone. If left, it forms an important addition and protection to the end of the stump. If it be removed, not only are these advantages lost, but the flap be- comes so thinned and weakened as to incm- danger of gangrene. I have practised the operation both Avays, and have from my experience found it most advantageous to leave the patella. There is ouly one objection to this ; and that is the chance of the patella being drawn up, as occasionally happens, upon the anterior part of the thigh. This is best prevented by turning up the. flap, and cuttuig across the tendinous insertion of the quadriceps extensor. About the management of the cartilaginous surface of the femur in these amputations, there is a difference of practice. Some Siu’geons prefer leaAing it; others, again, saw it off. If the articular siu-face be sound, the cartilage had better be left, as thus the cancellous structui’e is not opened, and one source of pya;mia is avoided. It the cartilages be eroded or otherwise diseased, they should be removed. This I generally do, after the disarticulation has rig. 09b.—Aiiixnit.itiou tlivmigli the Kiico, hy Long Anterior Flap.94 SPECIAL AATPUTATIONS. been completed, by means of a fine-bladcd Bntclier’s saw, cnttiiur round and not across the end of the bone; thus not shortening the stump, but simplv remoAung the cartilage, which would othcnvisc necrose or disintegrate and thus interfere with ready union. If the cartilage be left on the' femur it should also be allowed to remain imdisturbed on the patella. But if it^be removed from the femur so as to expose the cancellous bone, then the inner surfece of the iiatella should be removed in a similar mamier, before the flap is laid down. This null be found to furnish an excellent covering to the bone ; the patella, and the thick, tough, and extensile integuments of the knee, forming a good basis^ of support for the limb to bear upon, and one well adapted for pressime. The cut smface of the patella wiU apply itself to and unite nith the cauceUons surfaces of the condyles, and thus add to the solidity of the end of the stump. 3. S. Smith, of New York, amputates at the knee by Lateral Flaps in the following way. The incision is commenced about an inch below the tubercle of the tibia, and is carried downwards and forwards over the most prominent part of the side of the leg, until it reaches the under surface, where it is directed Figi GO.— Anijiutation at Knee by Lateral Flap. towards the median line. When this point is reached, it is cairied directly upwards to the centre of the articulatiou. A second incision begins at the same point as the first, and inmsues a similar direction on the opposite side of the limb ; the two incisions meeting in the median line behind. The inner flap should be rather the larger ; and the patella is left. After this amputation, the stump presents the aiipearance represented in Fig. 60. Amputation through the Condyles may be done by a long posterior or a long anterior flap, including the patella or not; or by a modification of the cir-95 AMPUTATION TIIItOUGlI TUB CONDYLES, cnlar method. Of these, that l)y the long posterior flap should never be employed, nnless, from exceptional circmnstances, no other flap can be obtained. Carden of Worcester was the fh’st to employ the method of amputation by the long anterior flap in this situation. He took away the patella and made no postenor flap but subsequent operators have found that without a postenor flap the coverino- is frequently insufficient. The operation is therefore usuaUy performed as follows. The finger and thmub of the left hand arc placed on the two con-^ dyloid eminences of ffie femur, wffich serve as guides for the starting points of the incision. A long anterior flap is then marked out, well roimded m shape, and reaching as low as the tuberosity of the tibia. This is dissected up either with or without the pateUa. In cases in which the Surgeon is hesitatmg between excision and amputation, the joint may be examined before proceeding further and the operation deteimined on. When the anterior flap has been raised, the knife is passed behind the femur, and a posterior flap, nearly equal in length to the anterior, is cut from within outwards. This flap contains the hamstring tendons, and usually a part of the muscles of the calf. It conse- quently retracts considerably after being cut. The flaps being held back, the knife is swept round immediately above the cartilage-covered siuTaces, and the saw carried through the bases of the condyles parallel to the articular siu’face of the femim, that is to say, slightly obliquely to the axis of the shaft. Stokes of Dublin has recommended that the patella should be left in the flap, and its cartilaginous surface sawn off so as to form a raw bony surface to be applied to the cut end of the femm. As a modification of these operations. Lister has recommended an amputation by a modified circular method, which is thus performed. “The Surgeon first cuts transversely across the front of the limb, fr-om side to side, at the level of the anterior tuberosity of the tibia, and joins the horns of this incision by can-yuig the knife at an angle of forty-five degrees to the axis of the leg through the skin and fat. The limb being ele'S’ated, he dissects up the posterior skin flap, and then proceeds to raise the ring of integument as in a circular operation, taking due care to avoid scoring the subcutaneous tissue ; and, dividing the hamstrings as soon as they arc exposed, and bending tlie knee, he finds no difficulty in exposing the upper border of the patella. He then sinks the knife through the insertion of the quadriceps extensor (Fig. Gl), and, having cleared the bone immediately abo^'e the articular cartilage and holding the limb horizontally, he applies the saw vertically aird at the same tiirre transversely to the axis of the limb (not of the bone) so as to ensme a horizontal surface for the patierrt to rest oir.” Wherr the'soft parts are much thickerred, as in disease of the knee-joint, the patella may Ire raised in the flap and the leg removed by cutting the errreial aird lateral ligaments. Ho groat difficulty will therr be found in exposing and sawing off the corrdyles of the femur. The admirtage of this operation is that, if it be carefully perfonned, the chance of sloughirrg is reduced to a mirrimrmr. All these amputations require very carefrrl drainage, as the pouches of the synovial membrane of the knee are very liable to fill with accumirlatiorrs of serous fluid. The advantages of this operation over arrrputatiorr of the thigh higher up are rrudoubtcdly great. The limb being removed at a greater distance from the trunk, the shock to the system Avill be less, and the rate of9 6 SPECIA L A MP UTA TIO NS. inortHlity climinislicd ; the Il^edullal7 canal of tlic femnr not being opened, there will be less likelihood of osteomyelitis ; fewer ligatures will be required, Jind, if a long posterior flap have been made, these may be brought out through an opening made in the centre of it, as Blaiidiu recommends; and lastly, a longei stimip will be left, the movements of Avhich Avill be more under the control of the patient than those of a shorter one, owing to the proper muscles of the femiu not being dndded, and all the movements of that bone being thus preserved in their integrity.

He is provided with a long thigh-stump, which gives increased leverage in using an artificial limb. 3. When the ampu- tation is practised with the long anterior flap containing the patella, the end of the stump will be protected by the dense and tough integumental and aponeurotic structures naturally situated in fi’ont of the knee-joint, which admit of pressure being made upon them without fear of excoriation : the cicatrix being ebawn up behind the end of the stump, and altogether away fi’om its surface. Aju’UTATions of the Thigh are commonly reqnhed both for accident and for disease. They may be performed in three situations : immediately above the knee, in the middle of the limb, or in its upper third. Amputation just above the knee is best done by lateral flaps ; for this reason, that the mass of muscle in this part of the thigh lies on each side of the limb, the central portion being occupied in front by the tendinous and aponeurotic structures connected with the patella, and behind by the upper triangle of the popliteal space : hence, if antero-posterior flaps be made here, they will be thin and tendinous in the middle ; whereas the lateral flaps are imiformly thick and Fig. 62.- Amputation of the Lowev Third of the Thigh hy Lateral Flaps. fleshy. In the middle and upper thirds of the thigh, the soft parts are so distrilnited that the antero-posterior flaps leave the best result, and give the best covering to the bone. If lateral flaps be made in these situations, the end of the bone is apt to be drawn up into the angle of the Avound between the flaps, Avhich fall away behind it. In amputation in the loAver or middle third, a tourniquet may be applied high on the limb ; but AA'^hen the operation is done in the upper third, there is no space for the application of this instru- ment, and the Surgeon must then use the abdominal tourniquet or trust to an assistant compressing the artery as it passes over the brim of the pelvis (Fig. 0, p. 35). Compression is best made by grasping the great trochanter Avith the fingers of one hand, and then applying the thumb firmly over the artery; upon this ttie other thumb is then pressed as firmly as possible, and thus all chance of letting the vessel slip is prevented In Avhatever situation A"OL. I. HSPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. 98 tlie Surgeon amputates, he must be careful to cany the knife so as to cut clean and transversely, and not to split the femoral artery or vein. Amputation above the Knee, or Vermale’s Operation, is done ly lateral flaps. In perfoiming this operation, the outer flap should always be made first. The point of the knife, being entered in the middle of the thigh, about three inches above the upper border of the patella, is earned close round the bone and brought out through the centre of the ham; the flap is then cut downwards and outwards ; the knife, being entered again in the uj^per angle of the incision, is carried close round the bone to its inner side, and the inner flap made by a sweeping cut (Fig. 62). Unless the blade be kept in contact with the bone in this situation, the femoral artery is very apt to be split. The flaps being then retracted, the bone is cleai’ed by two sweeps of the knife, and sawn about foim inches above its articular sm’face. In the Middle or Upfer Third of the Thigh, the Antero-posterior Flap Operation is to be preferred. In ordinary cases, the anterior flap may fii-st be made, and the posterior one subsequently fashioned by transfixion (Fig. 63, see also Fig. 8, p. 38). If, however, the patient be very much emaciated, it is difiicidt to get a good cushion from the anterior part of the thigh in this way ; and it is consequently preferable to follow the plan recom- mended by Mr. Luke of making the posterior flap fli’st by transfixion, and the anterior one afterwards by cutting from ■without iiiw'ards (Fig. 64.) In some instances in which the tissues at the posterior part of the thigh are much diseased or injm-ed, whilst those on the anterior aspect of the limb are sound, a very good stump may be fa- shioned by making a long square an- terior flap by transfixion, and then cut- ting at one stroke of the knife through the soft parts at the posterior aspect of the limb, in a somewhat oblique direction from below iqiwards. The anterior flap, when laid down, 'will form the cushion at the end of the stiuup. If the patient be excessively muscular, the operation may be performed as foUows. The Siu-geon, standnig on the right side of the patient, enters the knife mid-way between the anterior and posterior siu-face of the thigh on the side opposite to himself, and marks out a rectangular flap, with the right angles rounded off, equal in length to two-thirds of the dumieter of the limb at the'point at which the bone is to be saivn. He next sweeps the knife roimd the back of the thigh, so as to mark out a lounded flap equal in length to half the anterior flap. The limb is now raised, and the posterior flap, consisting of skin and fat only, is dissected up to the ang e of the flaps. The anterior is now raised, only skin and fat being taken for the first inch or so, after which the Siu’geon takes as much muscle as he thiidvs Fig. 63.—Amputation of the Thigh ; Antero- posterior Flap Operation.AMPUTATION THROUGH THE TROCHANTERS. 99 ^ulvisable to ensure the Titality of the flap (Pig.

It may be performed equally well at any part of the thigh Irom the trochanters to the lower end, where the skin of the patella is included in the anterior flap. Amputation through the Trochanters may sometimes be advantageously practised, either in severe compound fractm-es of the lower part of the thigh, or in cases of maligmant, cartilaginous or osseous tumoim of the lower and middle thirds of the femiu'; and thus the more severe and dangerous operation of disarticulation at the hip may be avoided. Indeed should it bo found, after section of the bone, that it is so much injimed or diseased as to require removal at the joint, this may readily enough be c one y dissecting the head out of the acetabulum with a strong scalpel or J * u-bof‘'imputation of the thigh is very considerable frac n-o oftr'? for compound < ue of the femur itselt.

In some hospitfils primary amputation of the thigh seems almost invariably to have been a fatal procedm’c ; whilst in other institutions the- mortality has not exceeded 50 or (10 per cent. At Guy’s Hospital and at University College, secondary amputation of the thigh has been more fatal than the primary. Tlie result of amputation of the thigh for disease of the knee-joint depends entirely upon whether the affection is acute or chronic. In acute snppuratn'e disorganisation of the knee, amputation of the thigh is most fatal ; indeed, so- high is the rate of mortality, that it is doubtful whether it is proper to perform the operation in that stage of the affection. In chronic knee-joint disease, on the other hand, the operation is most satisfactory and successful ; death seldom resulting unless the operation has been defeiTed too long. The general percentage of mortahty after amputation for disease is about 32-5. The causes of death vary according to the condition for which the operation is performed. In primary traumatic amputation, the fatal event is chiefly brought about by exhaustion, traumatic gangrene of the stump, or secondary hsemon-hage. In secondary amputations, and in those for disease pyaemia,, erysipelas, and exhaustion are the usual causes of death. Amputatiobt at the Hip-joiitt.—This formidable operation is of com- paratively recent introduction into surgery. During the early part and middle of the past century, its practicability was warmly canvassed in France. It was performed on animals expeiimentally. It was found that patients •affected Avith ergotism, whose lower extremities had become gangTenous, and had separated at the hip-joint, siuAuved ; and, at last, in the year 1773, the first successfid amputation of the kind was performed by Perrault of St. Maure. In the next year, the operation was done in England by Kerr of Northampton, on a girl aged 12, affected with coxalgia and lumbar abscess. The operation was unjustifiable in such a case, but the patient hA-ed 17 days,, and thus its practicability Avas demonstrated. Larrey performed it in 1793 for the first time for gmi-shot injmy; and since that time the operation has become an established one in surgical practice, civil as Avell as military. The operation was first performed successfully in England in 1812, by BroAAmrigg, of Plymouth, on a man whose thigh had been broken in the Peninsular war a year preA'iously. Amputation at the hip-joint may be and has been performed in a A'ariety of ways, which it is not necessary to detail. The most convenient methods are those by ant^o-]]osterior and by laleral flaps. Of these, that by antero-posterior flap is the simplest and speediest, and leaves the best stump. It consists in making a large and thick anterior flap by transfixion, and a short posterior one from the gluteal region and back part of the thigh. In order to perform this operation properly, the patient’s body must be brought well forward upon the edge of the table, so that the nates project beyond it, and be steadied by strong- bandages. One of these must be passed between the sound thigh and the perinanun, and attached to the upper end of the table ; another should be carried across the pelvis to the lower end ; and the sound hmb must be tied ta the leg of the table. The circulation through the hmb should then be arrested by the application of liister’s compressor to the abdominal aorta (Fig. Go).lor AMPUTATION AT THE JlIF-JOINT. i across the joint; its point being made to issue just in front of the tuberosity This is a most iiivalaablo instrument, completely restraining the circulation through the lower extremities, depriving this operation of its great clanger- undue loss of blood, and enabling the Singeon to complete it ivithout hurry or anxiety on this account. It should be applied a little aliovc and to the left of the lunbihcus. The Singeon must have tlnee assistants on whom he can fully rely. Assistant No. 1 takes chaige of the flap, compressing the femoral vessels ; and, in the absence of the ab- I dominal compressor, on his trustworthi- ness the patient’s life is mainly de- jiendent.

These prehminaries having been arranged, and the duty of each |! assistant assigned to, and distinctly understood by him, the operation is to be ; performed in the foUoiving way. The Surgeon, standing on the left side of the limb to be removed, feels for ' the bony points which guide his knife, idz., the tuber ischii and the anterior ' superior spine of the diiim. The knife, which must have a blade twelve ' inches long, requires to be entered, and the flap to be made, in different ways, according to the side of the body on which the operation is performed. If it ! be on the left side, the knife should be entered about two fingers’ breadth ' below the anterior superior spine of the ilium, or midway between it and the j trochanter major, and cairied deeply in the limb behincl the vessels, directly ' of the ischium or immediately behind the prominent ridge formed by the tendon of the adductor longus (Fig. GG). In transfixing on this side, care must bo taken not to wound the scrotum or the opposite tliigh ; the back of ,the knife must run parallel to, but not against the pelvis, and the point must not be held too high, lest it enter the obtiuator foramen. The anterior flap must then be rapidly cut downivards and forwards, about six inches in length. The limb, which has, during this stage of the operation, been raised and slightly flexed upon the abdomen, must now be forcibly, abducted and everted ; the capsule of the joint is then to be opened by a firm cut with the point of the knife. So soon as this is done, the head of the femur must be pushed up by forcibly depressing and abducting the limb, so that it may start out of the acetabulum (Fig. G8); the heel of the knife is then passed behind it, the remainder of the capsule cut across, and the posterior flap rapidly fashioned by Fig. 65.—Lister’s Aorta Compressor apiilied.102 SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. carrying the knife downwards and backwards through the thick muscles in- this situation. In doing this, the thigh should be extended and rotated' inwards, so as to clear the trochanter. 'The posterior flap may be about four' Fig. 66.—Amputation at the Hip-joint: Formation of Anterior Flap in Left Limh. inches in length ; but this must of course xary according to the length of the- anterior flap. When the amputation is performed on the right side, tho anterior flap is made by entering the knife just above the tuberosity of the ischium, and bringing it out two fingers’ breadth below the anterior superior spine of the ihnm (Fig. 67) ; the remaining steps of the operation being- performed as in the last case. In consequence of the extent to which the hmb that is about to be removed may have been injimed, or have been encroached upon by disease, it is not always easy to make the anterior flap of the size or shape described. A little management on the part of the Surgeon will however enable him to take the requisite amount of covering from the outer or iimer parts, by inclining the point or the heel of the knife downwards, as the case may require ; or he may make the anterior flap by incision from Avithout imyards, instead of by trausfix:ion. When the femur is entire and unbroken. Assistant hio. 2 uses it as a lever, bringmg the loAA'er end of it in the second stage of the opeiation downwards and ourivards, thus causing the head of the bone to press against the anterior part of the capsule, and to start out vnth a peculiar sucking noise as soon as that is opened. Should, hoAA'eA'cr, the bone haye been fractured high up, this movement cannot be given to it; and then the Surgeon must grasp the upper end of the femur beloAi" the trochanteis, so as to steady and push it back as he is disarticulating its head.

This fractnied Fig. 07.—Amputation at the Hip-joint: Formation of Anterior Flap in Eight Limb. condition of the femiu’ necessarily makes the operation somewhat more difficidt, as the Siu’geon is deprived of the long lever afforded by the limb in its sound state, by which the head is tilted upwards and forwards, and the capsule put on the stretch so as to be brought directly against the point of the knife as it is draivn across it. In amputation at the hip-joint, the great immediate danger to be appre- hended is excessive hiemon-hage, the incisions being made so high up that no ordinary tourniquet can be applied. By means of Lister’s compressor, the circulation through the abdominal aorta may be arrested, and thus the danger obviated. It is of great importance to perform the operation with as much rapidity as possible, and the disarticulation ought to be effected in at most thirty or forty seconds ; and it may be done in much less time than this. The an-est of the hiemorrhage during the operation must be intrusted to an assistant who can be fully relied on. After the abdominal compressor has been applied, and the floAV of blood through the aorta aiTcsted, liis business should be to compress the artery above the brim of the pelvis, and then to follow the knife in the first incision, and, as the anterior flap is being made, slip his fingers under it and gi-asp it firmly above and below, so as to compress the femoral artciy in it, Avhich is divided as the knife cuts its way out104 SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. (Fig. G8). By grasping the flap tightly, there will be but little risk of ha3niorrhage from the femoral artery, even when the abdominal aorta has not been compressed by the application of the tourniquet; but lest this should shp, or the assistant whose duty it is to grasp the flap by any chance should fail in holding it properly, it may be well to direct one of the assistants, whose business it is to steady the trunk, to have his thumb well pressed dovm into the ihac fossa, so as to compress the artery against the brim of the pehas. As the posterior flap is being made, the bleeding from the gluteal and sciatic vessels, which is often very free, may be arrested by two assistants who should be ready to cover and compress them Avith the fingers or dry sponges. Ihc arteries may then be ligatined one by one, as the assistant raises Ins fingers fr-om them If the other assistant haA^e good hold of the femoral, the vessels in the posterior flap may be tied first; but if the femoral be insecurely held, it must be first tied. The femoral arteries, both superficial and deep, will be found to be cut long, and to project fr’om the muscles, by Avhich they are surrounded, so as A’ery readily to be seized by the ingcis oi puUed out, and ligatimed.

This we should natm-ally expect from the size of the part removed and the”consequent shock to the system. The rate of recovery varies gveatly according to the condition of the limb that necessitates the operation. Thus, amputation at the hip-joint has been performed, so far as I can ascertain fr’om published cases, 120 times up to the year 1804 ; of these 70 died. But in 47 instances it was for injury : of these 85 proved fatal ; whilst in 42 cases in which it was done for chronic disease, 24 recovered and only 18 died. Frimanj emputation at the hip-joint in cases of severe injury of the thigh, by gunshot or otherwise, with comminution of the femur, is one of the most fatal operations in siu’gery. In all the 12 cases in which, it was done in the Crimea it proved fatal; and Legouest has collected 30 cases of this amputation, for gimshot injmy, in all of which the operation terminated in death. Indeed, up to the time of the war of the rebellion in America, there was no authentic instance of recovery under these circumstances. But in an elaborate and most able surgical history of that great Avar, published by the Singeon-G-eueral, 11) cases of primary amputation at the hip-johit for gunshot injury of the femin are related. Of these 11 died from the immediate shock of the opera- tion ; 5 died betAveen the 2nd and the 10th day ; one, a man 28 years of age, Avho had amputation at the hip jierformed by Surgeon Shippen seven horns after the receipt of his AAnund, Avas in perfect health four years. after the operation ; and the remaming two cases had been cured, so that one was alfre and well tAVO, and the other six months, after the amputation. Intermediate operations, or those done dining the inflammatory period, are A'ciy inisuccessful: 18 cases that occurred in the American Avar were all fatal. Secondary emendation, in cases of attempted preserA^ation of the limb after seA'erc injuries and gunshot-wounds, has been far more successful. Four cases in which J. Boux practised it in the French campaign of 1859 in Italy all 3-ecoA*ered, as did tAvo out of nine in Avhich it Avas practised in America. Re-amputation cd the hip-joint for diseased thigh-stumps has also been a successful operation : 4 out of 7 American cases recovered. Amputcdion at the kip-joint for disease of the femur has undoubtedly become less fatal of late years than formerly. This is OAving to the operation being submitted to at an earlier stage of the disease ; to a better selection of cases; possibly to improAnd methods of after-treatment; but maiifly to the influence of anaesthetics, by which the shock to the system necessarily resulting from so A'ery seA'erc a mutilation is materially lessened. The employment of Lister’s aorta-compressor Avill probably still further leduce the mortality by lessening the loss of blood, and thus proportionately diminishing those risks of low secondary disease that are induced by serious haemoiThage. •io6 INFLAMMATION. CHAPTER IV. INFLAMMATION. The study of tLe inflammatory process is one of the most difficult on which the Surgeon can enter; but the labour required to master its details is well bestowed, inasmuch as an acquaintance Avith its nature, symptoms, and progress, giA'es an insight into a greater part of the Science of Surgeiy. The Management of inflammation as it affects different tissues and organs, and as it in retinm is affected by A'arious concomitant circmnstances, comprises a gi’eat part of the duties of a Surgeon. The Theory of Inflammation is a pimely physiological and pathological study ; and, howeA'er interesting its investigation may be, yet, as the discussion of this subject belongs rather to the domain of General Pathology than to that of Practical Surgery, it cannot consistently be entered upon here otherwise than in mere outline. To gain a full acquaintaiice with the present state of our knowledge regardmg the intimate natru’e, origui, and progress of the inflammatory process, the student must consult such books as the works of Sir James Paget and of BiUroth on “ Surgical Pathology,” and the essays of Drs. Burdon Sanderson and Simon, and those observers in this countiy and abroad Avho have made inflammation the subject of special investigation. . , n . Before describing inflammation, it will be necessary to notice briefly tAvo forms of disturbance of the circulation Avhich, Avhile they always attend the inflammatory process, may exist independently of it. These are the two foms of local hypermmia, knowm as Congestion and Determination of Blood ; the former consisting essentially in retardation and the return of blood fmn a part: the latter, in increased flow of blood to a part. COHGESTIOH plays an important part in surgery : it occasions serious striic rural changes, and may run into inflammation. It is a true hjp.eramna, an excess of blood. The blood in the affected part is not only greatly incieased in quantity, but it circulates languidly and is of a darker colour than natiira The arteries are, at most, of their normal size, perhaps even contiacted t veins and capillaries are greatly distended by the . the circulation in the congested part becomes completely an-rested, stagn Symptom!—Congestion of an external part may be the changes it induces in the colour, the size, the feel the J pcratiire, and the functions of the part. The colour o a conges c from purplish red to a dusky broAvn ; its size is increased ; it pits uiidir the pressure of the Anger. The patient ^iten cons ous a heavy, dull, aching sensation in it, scarcely amounting o ^ teiuM with uneasiness. The temperature is never above, but often below, natural standard, and the functions are lessened in actiA-ity.CONGESTIOK 107 The oxistonco of congestion in an internal organ may be ascertained by finding its size increased, and its functions modified, wth a sensation of weight in it. The symptoms of internal congestion are often, however, very obscure. Effects.—These are of much surgical importance. The first change that nsnally takes place is an effort in the vessels of the part to relicA’e themselves, l)y a transudation of the more watery constituents of the blood into the sur- rounding areolar tissue. Hence the intei’spaccs of this tissue are distended by the eifused fluid, giving rise to mlema. If the turgidity of the vessels be gveat, and tbeir walls at the same time weakened, rupture null occur, and hasmorrhage to the surface, or into the substance of the part, wiU ensue. In consequence of the infiltration of the areolar tissue, softening takes place, nutrition becomes less and less perfectly performed, and ulceration at last occiu’s. These changes we not unfrequently see in the integuments of the' legs of old people. In other cases, the vessels becoming permanently dilated, the part assimies habitually a redder or darker tint, becomes swollen, and, if it be a mucous surface, it may be roughened and papiUated, as is often observed in a congested conjunctiva. Fih-oul induration is not unfrequent in congestion of long duration, and is due to the gradual increase of the connective tissue around the distended blood A'essels. But although the affected part may be increased in bulk, the normal tissue is really atrophied by the presence of the new growth. The liver affords, perhaps, the best illustration of this process, in the nutmeg atrojpMj that is frequently found associated vdth obstructive disease of the heart. Canses.—Congestion is always a passive and mechanical condition : and hence the term “ active congestion ” is not a proper one. What has been described as active congestion is merely a stage of inflammation. The causes of congestion, always mechanical, may be dmded into two gveat. classes, which we often find conjoined : 1. Those causes that act by obstructing the return of the venous blood ; 2. Those that act by enfeebling the walls of the capillai’ics and veins, so that they are no longer able to withstand the out- ward pressure of the contained blood. ^ 1. Amongst the first set of causes, may be specified any condition that, ^directly and immediately interferes with the proper retiun of blood through a ■\ein ; in this way the pressure of a tumour upon such a vessel produces, congestion of the part fi-om which it caivies off the blood. Venous obstruction does not always act in so direct a maimer as this ; for it not unfrequently happens, that obstruction to the return of blood from one organ will be attended by a congestive condition of the A'essels in a distant one. riius Ave find some fonns of congestion of the eye-ball connected Anth obstruc- tion in the branches of the portal veins. A long-continued dependent position of a part may occasion congestion, owing to the blood mechanically gravitating into it, and retarding, by tlie pressure thus brought to bear upon the vessels, the omvard moA'ement of the uid within them. Thus Ave see congestion of the legs from long-continued Btanding ; of the hremoiThoidal A'eins from an habitually sedentaiA life • and ot tlie posterior part of the lungs of those who have been long confined to the recumbent position.JXFLAMMATIOK. loS 2. Amono-st the most common canses of congestion that act by enfeebling- the vessels, Ave find the debility of old age, acting partly by lessening the tone •of the vascular system generally, and partly by inducing a diminution of the propulsive poAver of the heart. So also cold, by lessening the vitality and retai-ding the cu'culation of a pai’t, produces congestion in it. Certain typhoid or adynamic states of the system favoiu- the occurrence of congestion in the more dependent parts. And, lastly, inflammation may terminate in this con- •dition. The obstructh'e causes are specially apt to induce congestion when they occur in connection with a feeble condition of the vascidar system and vdth •cardiac debihty. Treatment.—The treatment of congestion has strict reference to its cause. The fii’st indication consists in the remoA-al of any source of obstruction to the retiu’n of blood from the part, as by unloosening a ligatm-e, or elevating a part that has been too long dependent; or, less directly, as in the case of many internal congestions, by restoring the freedom of the circulation through the larger viscera. Thus, a congested eye or pile may be reheved by the removal of hepatic or portal obstruction. The next indication consists in lessening the cpiantity of blood in the con- gested part. The mere removal of the obstructing cause may ettect this. In other cases, the direct remoA'al of the blood by scarification, as in a congested ■conjunctiva, or by leeches, as around a tingid pile, affords immediate relief. In some parts, again, the judicious application of a bandage aaIU preA'ent or remove congestion. With this Aiew, the hand and arm are bandaged before ' the apparatus for a fractured claAicle is apphed: and in vai-ix the leg is .supported by an elastic stocking, to lessen the pressm-e of blood in the dilated veins. The third indication in the treatment of congestion consists in constringing the dilated vessels by the direct application of an astringent to them ; thus we liabitually apply nitrate of silver to a congested mucous membrane, and cold douches to many external forms of the disease. Determination.—We hai'e already seen that congestion essentially con- .sists in an impeded retinn of the venous blood from a part. In cMermnation, the condition is reversed ; arterial blood is sent in increased quantity to a part, mid circulates through it with great rapidity. This condition, which is often called “ increased action,” differs, therefore, from congestion in every respect •except in that of the blood being in excess. ^ Determination of blood is aAutal process, often very transitory, and frequently ■occiu-s as a normal action in those conditions of the system in Avliich, tor temporary purposes, an increased afflux of blood is called foi by paiticu ai organs. The enlargement of the mamma; before lactation, and the turgor o the erectile tissues, afford familiar illustrations. ^ An increased local supply of blood lies at the bottom of most siii-j^ica pio cesses ; few important singical actions taking place a\ ithoiit it. o piocess y Avhich the separation of dead parts is effected, or by which t c lepan o woimc s or ulcers is carried out, can occur without it. Dvery tissue is suscep 11 c o i , and the Siu-geon often excites it intentionally as one of the mos e cicii o ns therapeutic means. Under these circumstances, therefore, it can scai-cely be considered a disease.109 DETERMIRA TJON. When determination of blood becomes chronic or persistent, it may lead to such changes in the appearance, structm-e, and functions of a part as materially modify its nutriti^’c and secretory acti^•ity; and then it becomes truly a disease. In these circumstances, the part is often said to be in a state of “ chronic irritation.” Symptoms.—The symptoms of determination of blood are those that wo should expect to result from an increased cpiantity of blood rushing with increased velocity through the affected textures. They are as follows :— Redness of a bright scarlet hue, swelling from tra’gescence of the vessels, heat appreciable to the Surgeon as well as to the patient, a feeling of fulness and of throbbing, with an increase in the quantity of the secretions of the part ; in fact, all those symptoms that characterise inflammation in its milder forms,, luit in a minor degree and of a less persistent character. Effects.—The effects of determination, Avhen acute, consist either in ruptine- of the affected vessels, and a natural relief by the hmmorihage which ensues, as may happen in piles after a dose of aloes has been given ; or, if a free surface or a gland be affected, in the poining forth of the secretions of the part, con- siderably augmented in quantity and, perhaps, deviating somewhat from their- normal chai’acter, as in lachrymation after the introduction of a grain of snuff' into the eye. When this effusion occurs within shut serous sacs, dropsical accumulations may ensue. The more remote effects of chi-onic determination of blood to a part consist in permanently increasing its nutritive acti’vity, and thus leading to indmation and hypertrophy. Or, determination of blood may run on to true inflam- mation. Causes.—The causes of determination of blood are threefold. First, an external iiritant directly applied to a part -will induce it, as when a gi-ain of dust is blo-\vn upon the conjunctnra. Secondly, internal iiritation, as excessive use of a part, uill determine an increased flow of blood to it! Thus,^ using the eyes much in microscopic investigations may produce redness, watering, and iiTitation of those organs. To this class of causes may also be referred the various forms of normal determination, such as erection, or the of blood from one part to another : as, when the application of cold to the ^ surface produces an increased afflux of blood to an internal organ. The vaso-motor influence of the sympathetic nerve exercises a marked control over the circulation of a part: and the relaxation of this control is. attended by determination of blood. Thus, when the svmnathetic unw. eidaxgement of the mammm in pregnancy.

The forms of local lijpeimmia—Congestion and Deteimination—described •above, arc essentially characterised by an increase in the quantity of blood in the part. In congestion, the quantity of blood is increased, but its motion is retarded : in determination, there is an enlargement of the vessels, and an accelerated floAV through them of an increased quantity of blood. In Inflamma- tion, there are in addition certain changes in the vessels, m the blood, and in the adjacent tissues, which give to it its distinctive characters. The phenomena of inflammation, as studied in the transpai’ent tissues of some of the lower animals, such as the wing of the bat, or the web of a frog’s foot, or the mesentery of the same animal, are as follows. On the application of an irritant, such as the point of a needle or a weak solution of salt or cold Avater, there is produced momentary contraction of the small arteries, followed by dilatation ; the veins also become dilated ; the flow of blood, which is at fu-st accelerated, soon becomes retarded; and stasis or stagnation occiu-s at points, commencing in the capillaries, and extending to the veins and arteries. At the points of stasis, there is an aggregation of the red and the white cor- puscles of the blood, which appear to block up the vessels ; the red corpuscles, according to Cohnheim, chiefly occupying the aiferies, and the white ones the veins. Aromid the centre of stagnation there is a retarded floAV of blood, in Avhich inflammatory area the corpuscles are seen to move languidly; and beyond this there is a rapid rush of an increased quantity of blood. These are the gene)-al phenomena presented by the blood-vessels and then- contents in an inflamed part when observed under the microscope. But in order to become acquainted with all the details of the inflammatory process we must analyse the condition of (1) the vessels, (2) the Uood, and (3) the tissues. 1. Vessels.—The observations of Wharton Jones on the frog’s foot, of Paget on the baf’s wing, of Cohnheim on the mesentery of the fr-og, and other similar investigations, agree in showing that one of the initial phenomena of inflam- mation is dilatation of the small vessels. But whether this dilatation be primary or not, appears to depend greatly on the nature of the stimidant applied, and on other circumstances that cannot be readily appreciated. Some- times the enlargement is seen to be preceded by temporary contraction; as Avhen the part is imtated Avith the point of a needle, or by the application of a Aveak solution of salt, or cold Avater, or spirit of Avine ; Avhile dilatation without nny appreciable previous contraction is at once produced by the application of acetic acid or capsiemn (Paget), Aunum opii, or a strong solution of salt or of sulphate of copper (Wharton Jones), or by the mere exposure of the fr-og’s mesentery to the air (Cohnheim). The solid sulphate of copper produces speedy, complete, and permanent contraction. ^ ^ ^ _ The dilatation affects not only the small arteries in the immediate Aucmity of the inflamed part, but those also at a distance : this is sIioaaua by the m- •creased strength and force of the pulsation in them, as may be readdy obseiwed in the pidsation of the digital arteries in a case of whitlow. That the rapidity ■of the ciuTent of blood Ixom, as Avell as to, the inflamed part is increased, isIll THE BLOOD IN INFLAMMATION. proved by the obsorwatioii of Lawrence, who found that in bleeding from both arms a patient with whitlow on one hand, more blood flowed from the inflamed than fr'om the sound limb in the same space of time. The dilatation of the vessels is at first attended with acceleration in the flow of blood, but, sooner or later, the blood-current is somewhat suddenly retarded and then gTadnally becomes slower until it stops altogether and stasis occurs. The retardation usually conmieuces in the veins, along the sides of which the white corpuscles may be seen moving sluggishly along, as pointed out by ]Mr. Wharton Jones, while the liquor sanguinis and red corpuscles flow more rapidly on in a central current. As the retardation becomes more advanced, the white corpuscles crowd more and more into the veins. When stasis has occurred, the red coiqDuscles which have accumulated in the cajDillaries adhere closely to one another and to the sides of the vessel. In consequence of the dilatation of the smaller arteries and capillaries, and the accumulation within them of large numbers of red corpuscles where, perhaps, only single files could penetrate before, j)arts previously pale may become brightly reddened. In this way for instance, the surface of the coii- junctiva may, in a few hoiu's, become very red, not by the formation of new ■\-essels but by the accumulation of blood in previously existing ones that are dilated. Besides undergoing dilatation, the arteries become elongated, tortuous, and waved, increasing in length as well as in diameter. The German pathologists —Kblliker, and Hasse, whose views are confirmed by Paget and Wharton Jones—have observed that the ai-teries of the inflamed part have a tendency to become dilated at points, so as to present small varicose or • anemismal pouches projecting from their walls, or fusiform dilatations of their whole diameter. The changes would appear to arise from one of two causes : either that the vessel is constricted at points between which it maintains its normal width, and thus that the dilatation is apparent and not real; or, that it is actually dilated where it appears to be so. This appearance of pai-tial dilata- tion is not, according to Virchow, confined to inflammation. 2. The Elood. Simultaneously with the above-mentioned alterations in the condition of the blood-vessels, certain important changes take place in the red and white corpuscles and the liquor sanguinis. As we have already said, the capillaries are packed ivith closely adherent red corpuscles, but it is the white coi-puscles m the veins that play the most important role in the inflammatory process. As long ago as 1841, Dr. C. J. B. Williams pointed out the fact that the white corpuscles are present in augmented nimibers in the vessels of an inflamed part, but it was Dr. W. Addison who, in the same year, first described a passage of the white corpuscles out of the vessels. This obsen-ation was confirmed in ] 84G by Dr. Augustus Waller, but appears to have been but little noticed until 1807, when Cohnlieim, of Berlin, published an accomit of obser- ^ations,m which he had seen both the red and the white corpuscles escapin«- ttirough the coats of the vessels without rupture of those. ^ The passage of the rod blood-corpuscles through the walls of the canilhrieci may be well seen, Cohnhcim says, in the web of the frog’s foot, when wno-es- CTOillar tying the femoral vein. Stasis in some of "the cp lies occurs m about a quai-ter of an hour ; and in less than an hoiu’ thereINFLAMMATION. 112 arc seen irregular projections from the walls of the A'essels. These projections go on increasing, and some of them soon separate themseh'es, and may be seen in the adjacent tissue as nnmistakable red corpuscles. Strieker, who, Avith Tvblliker, Sharpey, Billroth, Bastian, and others, confirms Cohnheim’s obser- A'ations, says that the injection of 10 per cent, solution of chloride of sodium favoms the passage outAvards of the red corpuscles so much as to cause hasmor- rhagic maculae. Cohnheim belieA'es that the amount of red corpuscles which thus escape, A'aries with the number of capillaries possessed by the inflamed organ; being' greater, for instance, in pneumonia than in inflammation of the mesentery. The passage of the white corpuscles tlirough the Avails of the A'essels is described as taking place in the folloAving manner. If the AA'hite corpuscles be carefully watched, some of them may be seen, after a short time, to pass through the wall of the vein against Avhich they haA'e been collected. This passage through is accompanied by striking amoeboid changes of shape. A small knob may be seen, for instance, outside the Avail, opposite to a spot Avhere a white corpuscle is chnging to it AAithin. The knob outside gTOWs laro’cr and larger, Avhile the corpuscle inside becomes smaller, till it finally A'anishes by passing altogether through the AA'all. In the capillaries, both red and white corpuscles pass out: in the veins only the latter. We shall have to refer again to this migration of the Avhite coi-puscles Avhen we come to speak of suppuration, in AAhich process it appears to bear an important part. Regarding the manner in which the corpuscles escape through the nnruptured walls of the vessels, there is not as yet an agreement among those who admit the occurrence of the migTation. Cohnheim, for instance, says that they pass by their amoeboid movements through stomata betAveen the endothehal cells of which the vascular wall is composed, and that their exit is aided by pressure : Strieker and Prnssak describe the process as effected by an “ active state ot the wall of the vessel, which consists of a homogeneous extensile protoplasm. Bastian ascribes the migration to amoeboid movements of the corpuscles, such as were described in 1863 by Recklinghausen ; and Bfflroth conjectm-es that the emigration of the colourless corpuscles may be facihtated by softeinng ot the vascular walls. , , Associated Avith the migTation of the white and red corpuscles thiou^h t^ walls of the vessel, is an exudation of a highly albuminous and fibrinous fliiic, derived from the liquor sanguinis, and knoAAui as mflammatory effusion. The fluid Avhich thus SAveats, as it were, fr-om the vessels of inflamed tissue, is rici in cells and molecules. The question of the origin of these cell-structm-es in inflalnatoiy effusions is a vexed one, and has at different periods received different answers.

Tt is true that Cohnheim did not himself, at fii-st, affirm that all the cell-structures Avere the result of the emigi’ation of Avhite hlood-coiiDuscles, but his doctrines rapidly gained gTouiid, and l)y some of the more ardent of the disciples Avere deemed capable of uniA'ersal application, ddiere can, hoAveA'er, be AX'iy little doubt that, although the migration of blood- coi-puscles accounts for a lai-ge proportion of the cellular and molecular elements in inflammatory effusion, some, at least, are derived from the prolife- rating tissue-elements themselves. Another accomit of the origin of these cells has been given by Dr. Lionel Beale, who alleges that they arise fi'om the germinal material Avhich exists as nuclei or minute granules in the blood and tissues. Be this as it may, the nature and quantity of the exudation, which differs from liquor sanguinis inasmuch as it usually contains a larger proportion of albuminous and fibrinous material and also an excess of chlorides and j)hosphates, aaIU Axry AAuth the tissue inflamed and the degixe of inflammation. In compact or non-vasculai* tissues the effusion is small in amount, but in loose and vascular tissues the effusion may be very great. 3. The Tissues.—As aheady intimated, important changes take place in the nutrition of the tissues during the inflammatory process. There is, in fact, nn increased but perverted nutritive activity of the tissue-elements. The inflamed tissue is SAAxllen and infiltrated, and greatly reduced in resistance and coherence, e\-en dense hard structures becoming juicy and soft. The tissue- elements are swollen, while the nuclei and cells undergo raj)id proliferation, and scattered about are large numbers of amoeboid wandering cells, dernxd fr'om the nuclei of the connective tissue and fr-om the blood. ^ But the nutritive actiA-ity is not increased equally in all tissues. In epithe- lial tissues, and especially in mucous membranes, there is a rapid development cf cells which, with the liquid effusion that is thrown off with it, constitutes Avhat is knoAAn as catarrh. In hard non-vascular tissues, such as cartilage, there may be veiy httle tendency to multiplication of the cellular elements. ^ These are the principal changes met AAuth in the vessels, blood, and tissues of the affected part. The nerves have doubtless an important influence, the precise nature and extent of which are not yet thoroughly understood! ^ Lister has obsenxd that the tissues of the part are in a state of impaired niffrition and diminished functional acthity; they “have suffered a diminution ot poAver to discharge the offices peculiar to them as components of the healthy animal frame.” ^ In Avhat relation, as to order, do the phenomena of inflammation stand to «ac ot ei ? fetricker, who has ably investigated this matter by experiment le leAes t at the prcliminaiy step is a morbid influence on the A’essels, either A irec 01 through the vascular ner\-cs, originating Avithin or Avithout the organism ; and that there then folloAv 1.

To IINFLAMMATION. it4 establish the existence of the inflammatory process, it is necessary that the actions constituting it should continue for some length of time ; as the changes gradually pass from simple hyperasmia into inflammation, it is difficult to say, except by the persistence and intensity of the symptoms, that this process has actually commenced. The Local Signs of inflammation may be refened to flve heads : viz.,. 1. Alteration in Colour; 2. Alteration in Size; 3. Modification of Sensa- tion; 4. Increase of Temperukire; Modification of Function of the Part Affected. Certain of these conditions may occim separately, or two or more may be associated together, without the existence ol inflammation ; but it is the peculiar grouping together of them all that most distinctly characterises the presence of this pathological condition. The relative intensity of these- changes varies greatly, according to the tissue which is the seat of the inflam- mation ; thus, in inflammation of mucous membranes and of the skin, the altemtion in colour is xiost marked ; in inflammation of the areolar tissue, the change in size always attracts special attention ; and when a fibrons tissue is inflamed, its sensibihty becomes greatly increased. It must riot be forgotten, however, that one or other of these signs may be abserrt, especially pam and heat. 1. Alteration of Colour is arr iirvariable local sign of inflammation, arrd orre of the earliest arrd most striking ; parts that are natru'ally perfectly pale, as the ocular conjunctiva, assuming the most vivid ermrsorr colorrr when irrflamed. Some textm-es, though they change in colorrr, do not become red. i bus, the ir-is, when irrflamed, assirmes a greyish or bromrish tinge ; and the mrreorrs membrane of the bladder, arrd of a portion of irrtestirre, ofterr becomes slate- colom-ed. The redness of irrflammatiorr varies from a bright crimson to a drrll purple, the tint depeirding greatly upoir the state of the coirstrtution, am upon the presence of more or less congestion. The duller arrd darker the tint, the more local congestion arrd constitutional depression do we usuaUy hnd. The redness is evidently due, in the earlier stages of the disease, to the drlata- tioir of the vessels, and the increased accumulation of red coiiruscles. ir some low or asthenic forms of the disease, the coloruing rnatter of Wood appears to rmdergo changes that allow its ready walls of the vessels, or perhaps there is an increased m,o,at.on «f corpuscles ; and in some chronic cases the Tasenlarisation of the pioducts of inflammation tends to render the coloration more enduring. • ni « ^ •> Alteration in Size.-The swelling of inflamed tissues is dne m the firet instance to the increased afflux of blood, and to the exudation of icd and uh t. e"s and liqnm sangninis.

Modification of Sensibility.—There is in inflammation always more or less pain, which is due partly to increased sensibility of the ner\'es, but chiefly to the pressure exercised on their terminal branches by the dilated blood-vessels, and by the exudatory matters. In inflammation of organs of special sense, instead of actual pain there may be some alteration in the special nervous sensibility of the diseased organ. When the eye is inflamed, subjective flashes of light may be seen ; when the ear is diseased, there may be noises of various kinds. In inflammation of the bladder, there is a constant desire to expel m-ine ; and in inflammation of the rectum, there are frequent attempts at defaecatiou. In the latter instances, however, there is often an undue irritabihty of the nerves of the affected parts rather than mere pain. Pain is one of the most prominent symptoms of inflammation, and its existence serves an useful purpose by preventing the patient from using oi* moM’ng the inflamed part. The intensity of the pain depends more upon the structure affected than on the violence of the inflammation, being, as a general rule, greater in proj)ortion as the tissue affected is incapable of yielding to the pressmn exercised on it by the dilated vessels and the effused matters. Hence, in general, the intensity of the pain is in the inverse ratio of the sveUing of the part. Thus, the pain of inflamed bone or fibrous tissue is excessive ; that of areolar membrane trifling. In erysipelas of the scalp, most pain is expeiienced in the ears ; the pain of an inflamed sclerotic is far greater t an that of a conjunctiva similarly affected. In some forms of inflammation pain can scarcely be said to exist, though the disease may assume the most estmctive fonn. Thus, in certain inflammatory affections of the throat and ot the pentoneum, there is little or no pain. The character of pain varies according to the seat of inflammation. When umcous membranes suffer, it is often of an itcHng or burning character, as in conjnnctnitis ; when the serous membranes of the chest or abdomen are at- stabbing ; aching in osteitis ; throbbing when pus is nmf testis or the kidney is affected.

In a case of extravasation of urine, with severe inflammation, I found the temperature in the incision made in the perinasum 98° Fahr. Simon and Dr. Edmund Montgomery, from experiments with a thermo-electric apparatus, have found : “ 1. That the arterial blood supplied to an inflamed limb is less warm than the focus of inflammation itself ; 2. That the venous blood retuiming fr-om an inflamed limb, though less warm than the focus of inflammation, is warmer than the arterial blood supplied to the limb ; and 3. That the venous blood returning fr’om an inflamed limb is warmer than the corresponding cuiTent on the opposite side of the body.” It is probable that there is always some local increase of heat in inflammation ; although the observations of Billroth, 0. Weber, and others, would appear to denote that the occurreirce is not constant. The rise of temperatme is probably but moderate ; to the patient, however, it appears greater than it is in reality—as Travers truly remarks, “ The nerves measure the sensation and not the degree of heat.” In many cases the sensation of the patient is that of Imrmng in the part, although the actual rise in temperature may be but trifling. This is owing to the exalted sensibility of the neiwes. How far the increased temperatme is dependent on the mere hyperasmia or on the changes going on between the blood and tissues of the part, is not yet decided. It must be remembered, however, that in aU conditions of severe exercise that part of the body in which determination of blood takes place, as also in blushing or partmition, the temperature rises. This can clearly not be owing to any production of heat during respiration, which may account for the gen&i'cd heat of the blood, but not for its local increase. 5. Modification of Function, Use, or Nutrition, invariably occms in in- flammation, and fmnishes important local symptoms. The Functional Achvifg of an organ is increased but perverted, in the earlier stages at least of inflamma- tion ; and the character of the secretions from the part is materially modified. Thus, when the mucous membrane of the urethra is inflamed, there is copious discharge from it; and this is not mucous, but pmulent. The Use of the pai-t affected is greatly interfered with ; thus the bladder can contain no m’ine, the eye cannot bear the light, nor can a joint be moved, when inflamed. . j.- . The NiilriUon of the inflamed tissues is modified or an’ested ; hence, wasting, softenino-, or contraction, are common accompaniments of inflammation. Constitutional Symptoms.—The severity of the constitutional symptoms will depend on the intensity and the extent of the inflammation; on the vital importance of the part affected by it; on the amoimt of local irritation ; and on the orig-in of the inflammation from external or from internal causes. Ihus, a moderate degi-ee of inflammation in a part of no Htal importance, as the skin, and occasioned by an extenial cause, as an abrasion, gii es use to no appiecn ^ constitutional disturbance. But if the inflammation be me e diffused erysipelas ; or if it arise fr-om constitutional causes ; or it the e c much local tension, as in whitlow ; or if the part aflected be ^ portance, as the larynx or the kidney, then the general symptoms become institutional disturbance in inflammation always assumes the form of117 STHENIC INFLAMMATORY FEVER. fgyei.—Inflammatory or Symptomatic Fever, or Pyrexia. Altliongli the blood may pre\doiisly have been in a diseased state, and so have predisposed the patient to the occuiTence of an inflammation, the inflammatory fever is invari- aVtly secondary, being consecutive to the local alfection. It is the true surgical fe\'er, no febrile disturbance occnrring in surgical practice except as a conse- cpience of, and secondaiy to, local disease or injury. This fever appears to 1)0 due primarily to the deterioration of the blood, occasioned by the accumula- tion in it of the products of the rapid waste of the tissues that are the seat of the inflammation, owing to their being poured into it more quickly than they can be eliminated by the diflerent emunctories of the system. The presence, in excessive quantity, of this effete matter in the blood, occasions congestion and disturbance of function of the excretory organs, and is liable to give rise to consecutive inflammations, sometimes of a low type, in various viscera. Inflammatory fever, or pyrexia, presents an infinite variety of forms ; the tjq^e which it assumes being finally dependent, 1st, on the state of the blood ; 2nd, on the condition of the nervous system ; and, 3rd, on the occurrence of certain local or specific symptoms determined by the seat of the inflammation. These varieties in the type of the fever arrange themselves practically into three classes :—1. Sthenic, or typical inflammatory fe^'er; 2. Asthenic, or t}q)hoid fever; 3. Irritative, or nervous fever. In aU these forms of fever there are three distinct stages : those of invasion, exacerbation, and dechne. In practice, the recognition of the type or form that the constitutional fever of inflaromation assumes is of the first consequence. The treatment of the patient, irrespective of the topical means that the special local affection may require, being altogether determined by the particular form that the concomitaut con- stitutional disturbance assumes, it caimot be too sedulously borne in mind that the local signs, “ the redness, swelling, heat, and pain,” do not in themselves comprise all the morbid phenomena of inflammation ; there is always accom- panying constitutional distiu’bance, sometimes preceding or predisposing to the development of the local signs, in all cases modifying their characters, and in' ariably, whether pre-existing or not, increased by the excitation of the local disease. It is the character of this constitutional disturbance or fever that 'will at last detenmne the kind of treatment to be adoj)ted ; and it consequently requires to be closely studied. 1. Sthenic Inflammatory Fever, true iDyrexia, occurs in individuals of ^ healthy constitution, young or middle-aged, in connection with those forms of inflammation that are of an active, acute character, and not unfrequently consequent upon injury. In this form of fever the stage of invasion is very shghtly marked, though it a ways occurs. There are shiverings, with some slight deiu'ession of the nervous system; but these symptoms may be so transient as to escape observation entirely, and speedily terminate in the stage of febrile reaction. In the majority 0 cases, it is not until the constitutional distiufiance has reached this staoc t lat it a,ttracts attention. The skin is now hot and usually dry, and there 13 a rise m the temperature of the body of from 2° to 5° Fahr.

It the tissue or organ affected be a mucous membrane, the n, a glandular stracture, as the testis or mamma, the pulse is compressible.INFLAMMA TJON. ii8 thongli full; if a serous membrane be inflamed, it is small, iucompressible, and wiry ; if a fibrous tissue be the seat of disease, it is hard and full. The secretions are ai’rested or diminished in quantity; hence the urine is high-coloured and acid, containing an excess of uric acid but a marked deficiency of chlorides ; the bowels are confined, the tongue coated with a ^Yhite fur, and the mouth clammy, usually with much thirst. There is a feeling of gTeat languor, and the head is often heavy and hot. The blood in inflammation undergoes important changes, both in the liquor sanguinis and the corpuscles. In the liqiior sanguinis the proportion of albumen and of saline matter is somewhat below the natural standard, while that of the water is increased. The increased thinness of the blood was long ago pointed out by Hewson. The amount of spontaneously coagulating material—or fibrin—is increased : according to Andi-al and Gavarret, it may rise from 2| per 1000 to 10 per 1000. ’\¥hen inflammatory blood is ebawn from the body, it coagulates more slowly than healthy blood ; the coagulum also is harder and smaller, and the quantity of serum apparently greater. The surface of the coagulum is com- monly covered by a tough layer of yellow fibrinous matter, the l)uffg coat; and its upper smface is depressed in the centre, haYung elevated edges, being cwp;ped, as it is usually termed. The “buff” and “cup” were formerly much used as guides in estimating the intensity of the inflammation ; it has, how- ever, been shown that buff may occm in certain conditions of the system, as in plethora, or pregnancy, or after exercise, without the occurrence of inflam- mation ; and that the tissue affected, rather than the severity of the inflamma- tion, determines its quantity ; thus, it is greatest when the fibrous or serous tissues, at least when the mucous or tegumentary, are inflamed. . The cupped shape of the clot is in some degree dependent on the shape of the vessel into which the blood is received, being most marked when the vessel is rather narrow and deep. The l)lood~coi''pusdes, both red and white, have been aheady described as collecting in great niunbers in the vessels of the inflamed part. Does this indicate an increase of both or either of these in the general mass of the blood ? The red particles, according to Andral and Gavarret, are increased iu quantity in the early stages of inflammation ; but as the disease advances they fan below the natinal standard, as Wharton Jones and Simon have pointed out. They manifest increased adhesiveness, and a tendency to aggregation into clusters by cohesion of their flat surfaces, in blood removed fr'om the body as Avell as in that within the vessels. As to the vMte corpuscles, we know they are present in augmented numbers in the vessels of the inflamed part: whether*, hoAvever, they are really more irumerous in the blood hr inflaurmatioir, is doubted by Paget, Simorr, arrd others. That air increase of the white coiqruscles is not an absolutely distinctive characteristic of inflammation, seems indicated by their excessive formation in leucocytluemia. As the fever declines, if a favourable termination occur, the system not un- commonly relieves itself by a critical evacuation ;—^from the skin, by abundant acid perspiration ; from the kidneys, by the froe disposition of lithates in the urine ; from the bowels, by dian'hoca; and fr’om some of the mucous surfaces,ASTHENIC AND IRIUTATIYE FEVER. 119 by luijmoiTliiige. The tongue cleans, the pulse lessens in frequency and in strength, the secretions become freer, the thirst diminishes, and strength and appetite return. Should the lever not take a favourable coimse, death may ensue by the occurrence of serious -s-isceral complications ; the lungs and brain being especially apt to suffer, becoming the seats of fatal inflammatory mischief; or the sthenic form of the disease may gradually merge into those types that are characterised by debility and in’itation. 2. Asthenic Inflammatory Fever principally occurs in those individuals whose constitutions arc broken by privation, dissipation, or by any of the general depressing causes of disease, as grief, anxiety, or long residence in a vitiated atmosphere. In constitutions such as these, frequently met with in all classes, but especially amongst the poorer residents in large towns, inflam- matory fever almost im-ariably assmnes a low type. There is also, in this variety of the disease, a special tendency to compheation with visceral mischief ; the lungs being peculiarly apt to become affected by a low or congestive fomi of pneumonia. The asthenic form of the disease may come on as a sequence of the sthenic •^•ariety ; the symptoms gTadually merging into those of a low foim, and being- characterised by debility rather than by strength of action ; the pulse becoming Aveaker though its fr-equency is kept up, the tongue becoming broATO and dry, Avith a tendency to the early supervention of dehrium of a muttering kind. When the fever assumes the asthenic form fr-om the very first, the period of depression is strongly marked, and often prolonged for many hours, reaction coming on gTadually and imperfectly, and alternating Avith the depression against which the system is struggling. Eaxu when fuUy estabhshed, the symptoms of the stage of reaction are not very active : there is throughout an appeai-anec of heaviness or stupor about the patient, Avith little activity of the intellectual faculties, and an early tendency to dehrium of a Ioav form, especially at night; the pulse is feeble, though quick ; the skin is either moderately hot, or else pungent and bm-ning ; the temperatm-e is fr-om 1° to 3° Fahi-. above normal ; the tongue brown and dry, Avith sordes rapidly accumulating about the lips and teeth ; the cheeks ai-e often flushed, and the eyes bright and staring. As the third stage comes on, if the patient recover, critical CA-acuations of a lifemorrhagic or dian-hoeal character apjAcar ; the pulse subsides, the tongue 4>Tadually and sloAvly cleans from the sides and tip, and the patient slowly aiid imperfectly regains his strength ; the conA'alescence being often interrupted by intcrcun-ent disease, and the poAvers of the constitution being fr-equently broken for months, or for life. If the disease take an unftiA'ourabie course, the lAcakness of pulse and the dark incrustation of the tongue increase,- the skin becomes cold ; hiccup, subsultus, dyspnoea, or coma super\'enc ; and death ocems from exhaustion, or as the result of A'isceral complication. 3. Irritative Fever is of a less specific type. It is usually associated Avith the asthenic form, the ncrA'ous system being esjAecially imjAlicated. It occAU's in individuals Avhose mental poAvers have been o\-erAATOught, or whose neiwous systems have been in-itated and shattered by intemperance. It is c-haracterised by in-egularity in its actions, by sudden exacerbatioiis, and by a lapid decline. The several febrile symptoms run high in the early stages.120 I^'FLA2{MATI0N. The pulse soon becomes sharp and small; there are hig'h delirium of a furious kind, wildness of eye, and heat of head. But these symjjtoms soon give way to signs of debility and exhaustion, and death takes place from coma and cerebral irritation. of Acute Inflajeviatiox.—There are two ivays in which inflammation may terminate without leading any traces of its presence in the part atfccted : these are by—1. Resolution, and 2. Metastasis. 1. The termination by Resolution simply means a retuni to health. The pain and heat first subside, the swelling lessens, and lastly the redness passes away: the constitutioaial symptoms also disappear. With regard to the more intimate changes in the part itself, it uill be seen that the dilated vessels contract, and the stagnant masses of blood-discs are pushed on and broken up by streams finding their ivay into and against them. Absoiption, which had been held in check clming the continuance of inflammation, comes into play and removes the extravasated matters ; and secretion becomes more active, and helps to unload the part. Resolution may in this way be complete ; or it may go on to a certain point and then stop, lea'sing one or other of the effects that will immediately be mentioned. 2. By Metastasis is meant a change in the seat of the inflammation—its sudden and complete disappearance fr’om one part and appearance in another. This is of extremely rare occun-ence ; it is occasionally seen, however, as in the inflammation of the testis that suddenly supervenes on the disappearance of a gonorrhccal discharge. Besides these true terminations, inflammation commonly passes from the ordinary and primary condition into some other form of the disease. Thus, for instance, the acute disease may merge into the chronic form ; if plastic matter or lymph be throAvn out, adhesive inflammation is said to have occurred ; when pus is produced, we have su-pj^wative inflammation ; when an ulcer forms, ukeixitive inflammation is said to have set in ; and when the inflammatory action is of such intensity as to cause the death of the part affected, gangrenous inflammation has occurred. These different conditions. "S'ary so widely fr’om each other, as to require separate and distinct consideration. Extension.—When inflanunation has once been set up in a part, it may extend to other portions of the system in four distinct ways. 1. Local extension may occm by the inflammation spreading along the tissue affected in its continuity; as, for instance, along the skin, areolar tissue, or mucous membrane. 2. Inflanmiation may also spread by contiguity of tissue, passing from one affected structure to an adjacent healthy one ; thus we see the opposite surfaces of an inflamed joint involved in disease at opposed points. In such cases, the part first inflamed probably acts as an irritant to that Avith Avhich it comes into contact, and in this way induces inflammation in the latter. 3. Inflanunation may extend to distant parts through the mcdiimi of the blood ; this fluid lieing altered and depraA'cd, and increasing the liability to inflammation in other parts, as in some of the erratic forms of erysipelas. Or the blood may coiiA'cy the products of inflammation to a distance, as in })hlebitis, and thus giA'e rise to numerous centres of inflammation.I2I UFFUSIONS. 4. [nflaraniation may appear in a distant part in consequence of metastasis, as has been already stated. EFii’ECTS OF IxFLAJiMATiON.—111 Speaking of the local symptoms of inflam- mation, reference was made to the occun-ence of effusions of various kinds, and of modifications in the secrefions of the part affected. These effects must now he examined in greater detail. Effusions are not invariably due to inflammation. Venous congestion will iwoduce an excessive transudation of fluid of a more or less watery character,, constituting oedema in the areolar tissue, and drojisij in serous or synoA'ial cavities. Thus, if the veins of the leg be compressed, oedema of the foot will result; if those of the Ih'er be obstructed, ascites will follow. Congestion of the renal veins produces albuminuria. If the jiressure on the vessels be great, the capillaries may be distended till they rupture, giving rise to effusion of blood, as in some forms of epistaxis and hmmaturia. The propter effusions of inflammation are—1. Blood; 2. Liqiior Sangumis ,- 3. Serum. These effusions are in a great measine mechanical, depiending on the dynamic state of the vessels, though doubtless in many instances modified by other causes of a mtal character. Fibrine, or lympth, though usually spiokeii of as an inflammatory efihsion, differs remarkably in its vital characters from the rest, and will be considered elsewhere. The fr’equency vdth which one or other form of effusion occurs in different tissues, or organs, varies gxeatly. Paget observes, “ each tissue has its proper mode and products of inflammation ; ” hence p3articular kinds of eifusions are very rare in some, although of common occiuTence in other p>arts. 1. Effusion of Blood often occurs in small quantity, tinging the other prodiTcts of inflammation. When this is the case, the coloming matter is. broken up and dissolved, a condition indicative of a low state of the constitutional powers. In other cases, the hmmorrhage may be abundant, the character of the blood being but little changed. This effusion is depjendent uj3on overdistension of the vessels, vdth softening of the tissues, gning rise to rupture of the caj)illaries. Haemorrhage of this kind most frequently occurs, fr’om mucous surfaces, which readily bleed when inflamed. It may also happen fr’orn the rupture of new vessels in fr’eshly depeosited lympjh ; or it may arise from migTation of the red coiqDuscles through the walls of the capflllaries. ' 2. Effusion of Liquor Sanguinis.—In this case, the fluid pearts of the blood transude, tearing the coiqDuscles behind. It is occasionally met with in so-called serous effusions, into the tunica vaginalis for instance ; so also the ^'lum contained in the blel) of a blister is really liquor sanguinis ; and Paget as found that in this there is most fibrine when there is most strength of constitirtion. This fluid is not uncommonly met with in the subcutaneous and submucous areolar tissues ; about the glottis, and in the scrotum, for instance, giring rise to a gelatinous semi-transp^arent swelling of the p^art. In t lose cases,^ the more fluid portions are sometimes absorbed, leaving the fibrine, tins constituting the condition termed solid mlema. The fibrine in this e usion often does not coagulate so long as it is retained in the body but ^'hen it IS removed, solidification ensues. Serous or Albuminous Effusions are veiy common in slight or subacuteJ 2 2 INF LA MM A TION. Jiitlammatioiis of serous and arcolai- tissues, giving rise to dropsies and oedema, ihey most frequently contain a small admixture of filn-ine, approaching somewhat to the characters of the last-mentioned effusion. The quantity of the librine contained in them is usually a measiu'e of the degi’ee of the inflammation. Those serous accumulations form and are absorbed Avith gi-eat rapidity, and their absorption is usually most rapid when the fibrillation is feast. Closely connected with the occurrence of these effusions are changes in the consistence of the part affected : these, however, being in part the results of the local disturbance of nutrition, which is one of the factors of the inflamma- tory process. These changes may be of two kinds : Induration, chiefly as a consequence of chi’onic inflammation, occasioned by the tingescent state of the v'essels of the part, or the effusion of plastic matter within it; and Softening, chiefly the result of acute inflammation, depending partly on the infiltration of effiised liquids into the textm’es, and partly on a disintegration of the substance, which produce a diminution of the consistence even of the hai’dest tissues, by impairment of their nutrition ; thus an inflamed hone may be cut and pared down with a knife, or the hgaments of an inflamed joint become so soft as to admit of spontaneous dislocation. This softening may ultimately lead to the mtersUtial alsorption of a part, which becomes shrunken and contracted after inflammation. Ulceration, as wll hereafter be fully stated, •is not an unfrequent consequence of this softening and atrophy, as we see in ■those joints that hare undergone inflammation. Interstitial absorption and gradual wasting of a part, without prerious softening, often occm as an effect of inflammation. Thus, a blow on the hip may occasion absorption and shortening of the neck of the femin. Loss of transparency in structmes that are normally translucent is a common effect of inflammation, as may every day be observed in the cornea. In some cases this rather depends upon a modification of nutrition than upon the deposit of new matter upon the part; in other cases, again, it proceeds fi'om the deposition of fibrinous matter. Secretions of Tissues and Organs undergo changes in quantity and quality, under the influence of inflammation. The quantity is at fii’st increased ; but during the active stage of the inflammation, when there is much tension, it l)ecomes diminished, the part being almost dry; as the inflammatory action subsides, and relaxation of the vessels ensues, it again becomes increased. The alteration in quality in secretions from glands is chiefly due to the admixtin-e of morbid secretions from the mucous membrane. AVhen a serous memhrcine is inflamed, the secretion not only accumulates in gi'catly increased quantity, as in acute hydi’ocele, but it becomes tiu’bid from the admixtme of flakes of lymph, which arc sometimes so abundant as to give it a pimiform appearance. In other cases true pus is formed, as in inflammation of the coniea and iris, terminating in hyiDopyon. In nrflammation of the aicolai tissue the quantity of fluid is either simply increased, or it becomes fibrinous, occasioning solid oedema and induration. In inflammation of the membrane the nrost importairt modifications of secretion occur. I he fust effect is to cause the transudation of a serous fluid fi’om the mucous mem- brane, the secretion becoming clear-, watery, and abirndarrt. As the iiiflamma-123 VARIETIES AND CAUSES. tion increases, exndation-coiiniscles and large quantities of epithelial scales arc thro^\^l oil', and, mixing -\vath the mucus, make it viscid and tenaoious—rojnj, as it is termed. In the more advanced stages we find pus and exudation- eoipuscles with epithelial scales, constituting the various forms of muco-pus and of true purulent secretion. Varieties of Ixplammatiom.—The symptoms, terminations, and effects of inflammation that have just been described, are those which characterise the more acute or ordinaiy forms of the disease. In practice, however, Ave recognise many important varieties. These may be referred to three heads, as they affect its Duration, its Intensity, or its Character. 1. Duration.—The disease may be acute or chronic, varying from a few days to many years, being especially persistent in those structures that are naturally least vascular, as, for instance, bones and joints. Chronic inflammation will be described in a subsequent part of this chapter. '1. Intensity.—When the symptoms are well marked, the redness and heat great, the tension high, and perhaps the pain seA'ere, with corresponding -constitutional disturbance, the inflammation is said to be active or acute; Avhen of a less intense character, it is termed suhacute; and when there are merely redness and swelling, with little or no pain, and but slight constitutional disturbance, the disease is said to be of a passive kind. The intensity of the inflammation is commonly gi’eater in proportion to the short duration of the disease, and less in the more chronic cases ; but very frequently inflammation of short dmation may be subacute or passiA'e, whereas some A'ery chronic forms may retain great actiAuty, and are especially liable to recurrent active attacks. 3. Character.—If the inflammation be circumscribed, occiuTing in a healthy constitution, and tending after a moderate time to terminate in resolution, it is called healUby or phlegmonous. If the vessels become distended and dilated, and the blood circulate slowly, the redness being of a purplish tinge, and the SAveUing considerable, Avith but little heat, the disease is said to be congestive. Of unhealthy inflammations there are numerous A'arieties : the diffuse, haA'ing a tendency to spread Avidely unchecked; the strumous, modified by scrofula; and the specific inflammations that arise from special causes, and are frequently capable of self-propagation. Causes of Ixflajdiatioji.—The causes of inflammation may be diAided, I 'e those of aU other diseases, into predisposing and exciting; and these again niay either be strictly local, or may act locally through the medium of the constitution. Local Predisposing Causes.—Though evciy tissue of the body is susceptible to inflammation, yet some parts are more liable to it than others. This cannot e owng to any grcater degroc of A'ascularity; for Av^e find that the tissues nnng t e interior of a joint more readily and more violently inflame, thougli ey aie a most extravascular, than a portion of the mucous membrane, Avhich is a ranc antly supplied Avith vessels. Indeed, serous and synovial membranes aie moie lable than most other tissues to inflammatory excitement. WhatcA'er niwwT ? t^^cre are two sets of causes that more especially pieclispose tissues to inflanmiation. imL^rof of part, by producing determi- nation of blood, may give rise to inflammation.124 INF LA 2 mA TIO N. AVhen a part, hai'ing once been the seat of inflammation, has been left in a weakened or impaired state, it will be more liable to the occmTcncc of a second attack of inflammation, having less resisting power ; hence, also, snbsecpient attacks are induced by less active exciting causes than were required at first to. call the disease into action ; we see this in the inflammatory aifections of eyes and joints. Then, again,^ a tendency to local congestion or stasis will dispose to inflammation, very slight overstimnlation inducing the disease when the A-essels of the part are already overloaded, and the reparative power impaii-ed this is often seen in the case of varicose veins, the congestion of the skin readily running into inflammation. Constitutional Predisposing Causes.—It is of gneat consequence to as- certain whether any constitutional predisposition to inflammation exists ; and if so, what its precise natme is ; for the progxess of the local affection will in a great measure be dependent on the amonnt of constitutional predisposition. The constitutional predisposing causes are of two kinds. 1. Inflammation is predisposed to by a state of general overstimulation of the vascular and nervous systems. This condition may be hereditary, as in persons of the sanguine temperament, or it may be dependent on youth or sex ; or'it may be acquired by habi trial indidgence at table, the induction of plethora and gout girdirg rise to a habit of body that is peculiarly favourable to the ocerm- rerice of inflammation. Inflanmrations occruTiug in this habit of body are usually sthenic, though not unfrequently accompanied, in the case of persons accustomed to alcoholic stimrdants, by irritative fever. 2. A directly oirposite condition of the system equally disposes the person to. inflammatory attacks. Thus a state of vascular and nervous de^vession, by lessening the reactive power of the constitution, causing a loss of tone in the- vascular system with ready tendency to congestion of the vessels, and to stag- nation of blood, disposes to inflammation. In this way inflammatory actions are esjrecially apt to occur in scrofulous patients, in whom the general powers are enfeebled; and in such individuals they occm’ rnider the influence of exciting causes less in degree than those which affect persons in whom nutri- tion is more actively canied on. Here inflammation usually assumes the passive, congestive, or asthenic fonns. Exciting Causes.—These are very numerous and simple in their action. . Commonly, mechanical injuries are those that occasiorr surgical iuflammatiorrs ; which are, irrdeed, set rrp by rratrue as the means of repairing the effects of the injury. Chemical agencies, as the application of caustics and undue extremes of heat and cold, are also amongst the most common exciting causes. The applica- tion of the virus of certain morVul foisons, as of syi:>hilis and the malignant pustrde, directly occasions it. And lastly, certain states of the Hood give rise to it, as wo observe in those conditions of the system in which boils, car- buncles, &c., are iwoduced. Inflanmiation Avill often, though not necessarily, vary greatly in character according as it arises from a constitutional or a traumatic cause. When an inflammation of an organ, as of the lung, arises fr’om an idiopathic or consti- tutional cause, a predisposition must previously have existed in the system, leading, under the influence of slight -s'eriations of external circumstances, as125 rilE VENT IVE TEE A TMENT. exposure to a draught of cold air or to wet, to the development of the local disease. The inflammation will, therefore, usually be prone to become wide- spread, and frequently has a tendency to assume a low ty2)0. In the case of a similar inflannnation, as of the lung, following an injury, as a wound of the organ, in an otheiuvise perfectly healthy subject, the disease will be localised in the seat of injury; having little tendency to spread, and usually assuming the active sthenic character. If, however, the constitution be in a bad state, and the blood unhealthy, or if the patient be exposed to uufavoiu’able hygienic con- ditions, a very shght injury may develop a wide-spread inflammation, which will then always assume a low and usually an erysipelatous form. Treatment of Inflammation.—It is interesting, and possibly practically useful, to study the inflammatory process pathologically and physiologically, and to recognise in it a modification or aberration of nutrition rather than a distinct disease. Yet, when we have to deal mth it therapeutically or sm-gi- cally, when we meet Avith it in the hospital-ward and not in the dead-house, or in the web of the fr’og’s foot in the physiological laboratory, we must be pre- pared to encounter it as a disease often of the most frital and destructiA'e character ; always dangerous to life or to organ when it passes certain hmits ; often dangerous to integrity of structime, even in its simplest forms ; and, when afiecting certain constitutions, as the strumous, liable to become most difficult of cure and inveterately chi’onic. Hence I shall speak of inflammation as we meet AAith it in siu-gical jiractice as essentially and substantially a disease, to be treated, cured, or removed as such. The Treatment of Inflammation may be divided into the Preventive and the Curative. The Preventive Treatment can be employed only in inflammation super- vening on injiu-y. In it the principal point to be attended to is, the removal of the local and constitutional causes of irritation. By doing this, the occiu’rence of inflammation in a liart that has been injured or otherwise disposed to its acces- sion may be entirely prevented, or, if this be not accomplished, the inflammation may be much lessened in seveidty. The local preventive treatment of inflam- mation is best can-ied out by the removal of all sources of iivita- tion, by absolute rest o‘J-—in'giiting Aniaratus. of the part, and by the fr’ce application of cold. If the injury be superficial, and not very severe, lint ippcd m cold water, fr-equently renewed, may be applied ; or, if the skin be muroken, an evaporating lotion may be used. Should a limb or joint be126 I21FLA jl/JfA TIG N. severely injured, eolcl irrigation will be a preferable mode of reduciim its tem- perature. This may most com'eniently be done by suspending over"tbc part a large wide-mouthed bottle full of water, in whieh a few pieces of ice may, if necessaiy, be put; one end of a skein of cotton, well wetted, is then allowed'to. hang in the water, ivhilst the other end is brought over the side of the bottle. This, acting as a sy^ihon, causes a continual dropping upon the part to which the cold IS to be apphed (Fig. 69). In some cases the apphcation of pounded ice in a bladder, or of cold evaporating lotions, may be prefeiTed to the iiTigation. Dry cold may be adi-antageously substituted for the moist in many cases. It has the advantage of not soddening the skin, and is less likely to be followed by gangTene, which may result from the incautious or long- continued use of cold and moistine. The dry cold is best aiiplied by putting- pounded ice into a thin ^mlcauised India-rubber bag, as recommended by Esmarch. At the same time all constitutional irritation must be removed by abstinence, rest, and a fr’ec aperient. In undertaking the Curative Treatment of inflammation, the Singeon must not aUoAv himself to be led away by the name of the affection with which he has to do, but he must be influenced in the means that he adopts by the con- stitutional condition of the patient, by the type of the inflammatory fever, and by the state of the diseased part; for nothing presents greater variety than the management of the inflammatory process in different conditions of the patient, and in the different phases of the disease. We shall accordingly consider the treatment of acute inflammation as applied to the sthenic, the asthenic, and the irritative varieties of the disease. Treatment oe Acute Inflammation with Fever of the Sthenic Type. —In the treatment of this variety of the disease, active and energetic measines. must early be had recom’se to, especially if the patient be young and strong. There is no affection that is more imder the control of the Surgeon than this- Avhen it occiu’s in a healthy constitution, and none in which more can be done- by actiA'e means early employed. It is consequently of the first importance that precious time be not lost by the employment of inefficient measures ,- otherwise, important local changes and iiTemoA^able alterations of structure may ensue. It is also of gveat consequence to remove the disease fully; not only to- subdue it, but to extinguish it, lest it degenerate into some of the more chi-onic,. passive, and intractable forms. The first thing to be attended to in the treatment of the sthenic, and of all the other Amrieties of inflammation, is the removal of the cause. Thus, rest must be afforded to a diseased joint, light Avithheld fr-om an inflamed eye, and a foreign body taken out of the flesh in AA’hich it is lodged. The next great indication is to lessen the determination of blood to the part. The measines for accomplishing this comprise what has been termed the anti- fhlogistic. treatment. This consists of constitutional and local means. Constitutional Treatment.—The most poAverful and efficient means that Ave possess is certainly Blood-letting; and, Avhen the inflanmiation is sufficiently extensive and scA’cre, and the state of the patient’s poAvers Avarrant it, wc may haA'c rccoinsc to tlie abstraction of blood. But, as blood can easily be taken aAvay, but cannot readily be restored, avc should never remoA’e it unnecessarily,.127 COXSTITUTIOXA L TEE A TMENT. lest jJcrmimeiit ill effects to the health ensue. Blood-letting is certainly not often required in the treatment of surgical inflammations ; and it should be- especially aA'oided in A’ery young and in vciy old subjects, in the inhabitants of large tOAsms generally, or in persons who suffer from inflanunation of a specific character. It should never be employed unless an organ of great importance to the economy, as the lung or brain, for instance, be inflamed, or so injiu-ed that inflammation is imminent; or unless a tissue, like the transparent stracture of the eye, be affected, in which case it is absolutely necessary, at any risk, to cut short an inflammation before it gives rise to a change of structure, which, how- ever shght, would be fatal to the utility of the part. The quantity of blood that should be taken necessarily varies gTeatly, according to the age and con- stitution of the patient, and the nature of his disease ; and it is of importance- to bear in inind that, when blood-letting is really required, the system tolerates- the loss of the vital fluid in a way that it does not othenvdse. The effect produced on the piflse and on the system should be the guide to the quantity to be taken away. A decided impression shoidd be produced by blood-letting, not so much on the frequency of the pulse, as on its character ; that should guide us, and not the number of ounces dra^vn. The point to be obtained is the greatest effect upon the system udth the least loss to the patient; hence the- blood should be taken fr’om a large orifice in the median basilic or the median cephalic vein, the patient sitting upright. In repeating the venesection, Ave- must be guided by the impression that has been made upon the disease, and by the state of the pulse. By blood-letting, when it is indicated by the severity of the inflammation, or by the importance of the part affected, Ave not only lessen the force of the circidation, but Ave also abstract at once fr'om the system a quantity of blood that has been deteriorated by an accmnidation of the products of the Avaste of tissues. It is especially in those forms of inflamma- tion, therefore, in which the blood is early and abundantly charged Avith these products, in which it is superfibrinated to a great extent, as in inflammation of serous membranes and of fibrous tissues, that blood-letting has been proved by experience to be of service. Whether blood-lettiiig be practised or not, we must endeaA'oiu to set the secretions free, and in this Avay to clear the blood of the morbid products accu- mulated in it. If we can bring about a full action from the liA'er or boAvels, Avith copious bilious evacuations, abundant secretion of acid perspiration fr-our the skm, or a copious discharge of urine loaded Avith lithates, we shall often at once cut short the disease. With these objects in AieAv, purgatives, diapho- retics, and diuretics arc to be administered. • should always be given early, except in some special cases of acute inflarmnation of the abdominal organs. They clear the intestinal canal free the secretions, and equalise the circulation.

It is also probable that the salines alter the con- stitution of the blood, dissolving- tlic fibrine and lessening tbe quantity of water, both of which constituents are in excess in inflammation. Aconite in small doses frequently repeated—one minim of the tincture every half hour for four horns and then every hour—exercises a most marked influ- ence on simple inflammatory fever when there are no ^dsceral complications. It lowers the force and frequency of the pulse, and produces speedy and copious sweating, to the infinite relief of the patient. In many forms of sthenic inflammation, especially those Avhich afiect the serons and fibrous membranes, we do not possess a more eflicient agent than mercury, administered, not as a pingative, but as an alterath'e to the system. And I confess that I can in no way give my adherence to the doctrines of those AA’ho, disregarding the daily evidence of professional experience, deny the utility of the preparations of this mineral in the treatment of certain forms of inflam- matory disease. Mercurial remedies are of special sendee in aiding the opera- tion of other medicines. Diinetics, diaphoretics, and pmgatives, aaoU fr’equently not act properly unless conjoined with a mercinial. In inflammation, the pre- parations of mercury act as direct antiphlogistic agents, lessening the quantity ■of fibrine in the blood, and equalising the circulation. They arc of especial A’alue in promoting the absorption of exudation-matters, more especially of lymph, as we may see happening imder their influence in certain diseases of the eye. They appear to do this rather by loAvering the A'ascular action of the part, •and thus alloAAdng the absorption, which had been arrested during the persist- ence of the inflammation, to be canded on, than by any special influence exer- cised oA'er the efiPused material. Care, however, is required in the administra- tion of mercury. In indtable or cachectic constitutions it should not be gfr'en at all, or not Avithout great caution. It is best borne by strong constitutions, and in acute inflammation of the serous and fibrous tissues. Calomel, blue pill, and poAvder of merciuy AAdth chalk, are the preparations usually employed Avhen the mineral is given by the mouth. When it is ad- ministered endennically, the mercurial ointment is preferred ; and the use of the mineral is in general continued until the gums become spongy, and a red line is formed at their edge ; the patient experiencing a coppery taste in the mouth, and the breath becoming fetid. It is not necessary to induce profuse saliA'ation. It is especially the combination of calomel with, opium that produces the most beneficial ettects in the treatment of active singical inflammation. One or two grains of calomel, and half a gi-ain or a grain of opium, or fiA’c grains of Dover’s poAvder Avith three of mercury and chalk, every fourth or sixth horn, tranquillise the system and lessen vascular action in a reniai-kable manner, especially in acute inflammation affecting the joints, the eye, or the serous membranes. _ • • i i • Opium is not only of use in the way that has just been indicated, but is of essential scrA-icc in allaying the pain and irritability that ofteii accompany inflammation, especially in many inflammatory affections ot the^ bones an joints. In the foim of Dover’s powder, it is of especial value in this respect. In the treatment of acute inflammation, it is ot essential consequence t lat the patient should bo kept at rest, in an atmosphere of AA'ell-regulatcd tempera-129 LOCAL TREATMENT. ture, and on low diet; in fact, the more complete the abstinence in this respect, the more rapidly do therapeutic agents act and the febrile symptoms cease. Looai< TrbatjMEXT.—This is of the utmost importance, as it directly in- fluences the tissues and vessels that are deranged in action. It consists of means of the most varied and opposite characters. Heat and cold ; iced water and hot fomentations ; astringents and sedatives—are all employed, and all vdth success, but each only in certain stages and forms of the disease ; and the art in conducting the local treatment of inflammation consists in adapting the various means at our disposal to the particular condition of the case before us. Local Blood-letting is the most efiicient means we possess in directly lessening vascidar action in a part, as by it we take the blood directly from the inflamed and tingid vessels. It may be used in addition to, though it is now veiy commonly employed in in’eference to, general blood-letting, especially if the inflammation be not severe, or if it occur at either of the extremes of life, in women, and in persons generally of feeble power. Blood may be taken locally hj pumtures, scarifications, or incisions, or by Jeeching or cupping. Punctures and mmsw7is can oidy be practised in inflammation of the cuta- neous and exposed mucous surfaces, due attention being paid to subjacent j)arts of importance. They constitute a very efiicient means of reheving the part, as not only is blood removed, but au exit is afibrded for effused matters ; tension is consequently materially lessened, and the tendency to sloughing and other e-^-il after-efiects perhaps prevented. The removal of the tension of inflamed parts is not only of the gveatest advantage locally, but is of considerable service to the system at large by lessening the pain and general ii-ritation, that are always occasioned by it. The punctures should be made with a fine lancet, m parallel rows over the inflamed surface, and should not exceed a quarter of au inch m depth. The incisions must always be made in the axis of the limb, and s ould be so amiiged as to afford the greatest possible relief to the tension. eu length and their depth must vaiy according to the seat of the inflam- matioii. Thus m the inflamed conjunctiva they must of course be very hmited, whilst in phlegmonous inflammation of a limb they may be of much gi-eater extent and depth. Care must be taken as far as possible not to wound super- cia ar encs 01 l ems. A modification of puncture is sometimes practised openmg le yems in the neighbourhood of the inflamed part at several ^ 1 inflammation of the testis the scrotal A’eins may bo bp ^\^i^ v antage.

In this way from half an ounce to an ounce of blood may be taken by each leech. There is usually no difficulty in aiTcsting the haemor- rhage from the bite ; should there be any difficulty, continued pressure with some scraped lint, felt, matico, or powdered alum, will generally succeed. If this do not, which may happen in some situations where pressure cannot l:>e conveniently applied, as on the neck and abdomen, particularly in young childi'en, a piece of nitrate of silver scraped to a point, or a heated wire intro- duced into the bite, previously wiped dry, or a needle with a twisted suture over and around it, may be required. Ouppinf] is the most efficient means of removing blood locally that we possess, and the quantity extracted may be regulated to a nicety. It cannot, however, be employed upon the inflamed surface itself, on account of the pain and irritation that it would occasion, and is consequently chiefly ap- phcable to internal inflammations. As the scars made by the scarifleators continue thi’ough life, cupping should not be practised upon exposed surfaces. Cutting off the Supply of Blood fr’om the inflamed part by the ligature of the main artery leading to it has been adopted in some cases. Thus, in acute inflammation of a joint, the main artery of the hmb has been tied ; the femoral, for instance, in inflammation of the knee-joint. By many Smgeons, and by most patients, the remedy would be considered far worse than the disease for the cure of which it is proposed. Vanzetti has recommended digital pressure on the arteries in inflammation. He has, for instance, related a case of severe acute inflammation of the hand, relieved by twenty-foiu’ hours’ continuous pressiu’e on the brachial artery. Neudbrfer speaks highly of the proceeding, which he regards as simpassing all others in efficacy, even rendering ininecessary the ordinaiy antiphlogistic treatment. He recommends intermittent pressm’e for not less than three and not more than eight minutes three or four times a day. The method is ap- plicable to inflammation of any part of which the artery is within reach; and though we may not go so fai‘ with Neudorfer as to suppose that it obviates all necessity for constitutional treatment, it appears to be a remedy far preferable to local blood-letting. In Gold and Heat we possess two most important local means of controlling inflammation. They cannot, however, be employed indiscriminately. Cold.—There are two stages of inflammation in which cold may be employed Avith especial advantage: first, during the very early and acute stage, rather with a view of preventing or limiting the inflammation, so that it may not pass beyond the bounds of adhesive action; and next, when acute inflammation has passed off, the vessels of the part remaining relaxed and turgid: the apphcation of cold being a powerful agent in restoring the tone of the parts. Cold should never be had recourse to between these stages, when supina- tion is coming on, or has set in; still less should it be employed when there is a tendency to mortification. Its long-continued and incautious use may indeed be followed by profuse suppuration or extensive sloughing. The modes of applying cold vary according to the part affected imd s i of the inflammation. In the early and acute stage, and when the « inflamed, evaporating spirit lotions, to which sedatnes inay wliole advantag’eously addeci, me the best. If it be wished to influence the wholeLOG A L TEE A TMEXT. snbsfcaiico of a limb, iiTigatiou with cold water should be employed (Fig. 69). It it be intended that the etfect of the cold shall penetrate deejjly, as in inflamma- tions ot joints, ot the head, spine, or chest, pounded ice may be applied. The ice is best applied by being placed in a bladder, gut, or a Mackintosh bag, partially filled. Esmarch has especially pointed out the gTcat advantage of using an India-rubber bag, which always remains dry, and from the use of which no danger from fi'ost-bite is to be apprehended, as may occin’ from the long-continued use of cold and wet appheations. With the \iew of removin<>- the congestion remaining after inflammation, cold douching or sponging is most etflcjicious. ° Warmth and moisture conjoined ai-e of the utmost service in the treatment of inflammation dining the height of that process—dm-ing that period when cold applications are not admissible. By these means, tension is relaxed, effusion is fiivoined, and the over-distended vessels are relieved. If continued for too long a time, however, these means favoin congestion, and sodden the parts. Marm applications are especially serviceable in aU cases of inflammation attended by much pain, more particularly if this occin from tension ; and they are espeeially useful when suppuration is threatening, or has come on, and 511 many cases where there is a tendency to slough. When abscess threatens, or the sinfiice is broken, nothing affords so much relief as a well-made poultice, either of liuseed-meal or of bread; this, made soft and smooth, and not spread too thickly on the cloth containing it, should t>e applied as hot as the patient can bear it.

Treatment op Acute Inflammation with Constitutional Symptoms of THE Asthenic and Irritative Types.—The asthenic and 'imtakve forms of inflammation derive their peculiarities from the character of the constitutional disturbance, rather than from any peculiarity in the local affection. Hence it is in the management of the constitutional condition that the principal differ- ence exists between the treatment of these and that of the other vai'ieties of acute inflammation. In considering this part of oiu’ subject, it is of especial importance to banish the term ‘‘ antiiMoyistk; ” for the same treatment that would aiTcst inflam- mation in one form of the disease, would certainly favour its progress in another. Nothing appears to me to he more unscientific than to endeavoiu to treat all inflammations on one imiform plan. Siuely the scoffers at medical science have some ground for doubting at least the wisdom of its Professors, when they see one set of practitioners treating every inflammatoiy disease vith depletion, antimony, and calomel, whilst others teach that the panacea for all inflamma- tions consists in brandy, ammonia, and hark. It is hnpossible that ho& methods can be right, as exclusive plans of treatment. But the eiTor lies in making them exclusive. Each is serviceable in, and indeed only applicable to, its omi particular cases. And between these extremes lie a multitude of foms. of disease, in which endless modifications and comhmations of these two- methods of treatment—the stimulating and the depletory—must he adopted bj the Surgeon in order to meet the varying conditions of his patient. Ihe local symptoms that accompany the inflammatory process, whether occumng exter- nally or internally, in the conjmictiva or in the lung, are associated with constitutional distiubance that varies according to the age and the constitu- tional condition of the patient. It is the tyiie assumed by this constitutional disturbance, its sthenic or its adynamic character, as mdmatedhy the pulse and by the tongue, and not the mere diagnosis of the local disease, that must guide tL Sm-eon i; the adoption of his line of practice. We may advantageously treat with antimony and blood-letting acute inflammation of the conjunctiva, ov tLt which is the consequence of awound of the lung, in an otherwise healthy and robust man of thirty ; whilst in a broken man of seventy, ammonia, haik, /odd be equally propev ; but if wo wove (except under Louliar and exceptional circumstances) to rCTerse this treatment—to stimulate or vigm-ons, and to deplete the aged or feeble-we should act eo i- tr/y to common sense, and probably destroy mtber ^ is offer oTeater importance to be able to estimate accurately the tiiie coustit tional disturbance as ot minor ™ treat erysipelas or * iraTLt/eern;^^ or of tu; lung, on one uniform plan.TREATMENT OF ASTHENIC INFLAMMATION. 133 without reference to the type of the constitutional disturbance accompanying- them, Avc shall miserably err in a large proportion of the cases. But if, payin'^ but little heed to the local affection, except so far as its characters indicate the general type of the disease, we make the constitution of the patient our guide, and deplete or stimulate accordingly, even thoiTgh we treat two patients with the same disease, so fixr as name is cojicerned, on totally opposite plans, we shall not act inconsistently, but in strict conformity wdth the natural conditiou of the patient and of his disease. We must be guided in the means that we adopt entirely by the condition of the patient, the state of the tongue and pulse, and the general character of the symptoms. If these from the first partake of the asthenic or irritative type, we camiot at any period have recoiu-sc to the treatment that has been recom- mended in sthenic inflammation. If the disease commence in an active form, the fever progressively assuming a lower and lower character, merging into the asthenic and irritatfr-e types, so must Ave gradually modify the natm-e of oiu* general treatment. This, hoAvever, is ahvays a dehcate procedure, requiring much caution. Though the inflammatory fever may at first assume the sthenic form, if there be reason to beheve, fr'om the broken constitution of the patient, or fr-om the congestive or passive character of the local inflammation, that the •constitutional symptoms AAdU not long continue of this type, we must be extremely cautious hoAV Ave lower the patient by active depletion; for, however high the fever may at fii'st run (and in these cases there is often febrile distinb- •ance of a A'cry actiAC character for the first few days), the disease speedily expends its force and rapidly subsides into a low form. In cases of this kind, AAfrich are of A'ery conmion occuiTence in London practice, more particularly in hospitals, AAC should never bleed, but content oinselves, after clearing out the boAAcls, with keeping the patient quiet on a moderately Ioav diet, and adminis- tering diaphoretic salines. As the symptoms gTadually merge into the typhoid type, the pulse increasing in frequency, but diminishing in power, the tongue becoming diy and dark, and the other symptoms of asthenia beginning to shoAv themseh-es, we must beg-in to give some stimulant in combination AAuth the •salines. The carbonate of ammonia in five or ten grain doses, or even more, may be given with bark, or in an effervescent form Avith fifteen grains of the bicarbonate of potash and a sufficient quantity of citric acid, every third or fourth hour. The nourishment must be increased ; and wine or alcoholic •stimulants must be conjoined Avith it, in proportion as the symptoms of debility lecome ruoie and more marked. In effecting this change, hoAA'CA’er, aa'c must be careM not to run into the eiTor of overstimulating our patient; this may le aA OK ed by observing the influence exercised on the pulse and tongue by the change ni treatment. fi ■ f ^ cases, this stimulating plan is not well borne during the setting in of an inflammation, especially if there be S‘‘s lie nutation a.nd sickness ; but Avheu the more active symptoms shoAV a cn ency to subside, when the boAvels have been avcU cleared out, and the In-fu f-ssixmc a slight degTce of moisture, then it may be resorted to with every probability of success. ^ Jc/aLhenh liappens that the symptoms so rapidly sink into chaiactei,or from the very first assiune it, that the only treatment^34 INF LAMM A TION. ■\vliicli holds out a lu'ospoct of saA'iug the patient’s life consists in the early and- free administration ol tonics and stimulants, Avith mild nourishment, such as. ammonia and bark, Avinc, brandy, or porter, Avith beef-tea and aiTOAvroot; and ot these, large qiiantities may be required in the four-and-tAventy hours, the- patient CAancing a tendency to sink AV'heneA'er their use is interrupted. Although stimulants be freely administered in these cases, the food should be bland and capable of easy assimilation. It is Avorse than useless to give meat, &c., Avhen the patient cannot digest it; but beef-tea, eggs, and farinaceous food, may be. giA'en in large quantities A\’ith adyautage. The brandy-and-egg mixtiu’c of the Pharmacopoeia, if aa'cII made, combining nutriment and stimulus, is the best, remedy that can be administered in many cases of Ioav inflammation. Under this plan of treatment the tongue AA'ill be found to become moist, the- broAAui sordes to clear off from the inside of the mouth, the piflse to become steady and full, sleep to be procured, and the strength maintauied. The- more I see of sm’g-ical inflammation, the more confidence do I feel in thist stimulating plan of treatment, Avhich is the only method of carrying patients through those Ioav forms of visceral inflammation that are so fr’equent in hospital practice. The liability to these inflammations aaiII also be materially lessened by the early employment of a stimulating plan of treatment afteu injuries and operations.

The precedirrg descriptiorr is principally applicable to acute irrflammatiou arrd it rroAV remains to give a brief srrmmary of the distinctive characters of the chrorric form of the disease, arrd to describe its treatment. Pathology.—In aerrte irrflammatiorr, the changes that take place irr the vessels and in the blood are strorrgly marked and more or less rapid irr occur- r-ence ; arrd the modifications of nutrition Avhich the part rrndergoes are mostly of a temporary character, and hold a secondary relation in point of importarree to the other conditions. Irr chrorric inflammation, on the other harrd, the changes in the nutrition of the part form the principal featrrrc. Billroth, hr describing chr'onic irrflammation, says : “The disterrsiorr of the capillary^ vessels, or fluxion, is a less promirrerrt symptom, Avhile the ncAV forrnatroir of tissue and serous irrfiltratiorr seem to play a more promirrent role, infiltratioir of the tissue takes place irr fcAV' cases, as it does irr acute rnflamrira- tion ; brrt the irrdiA'idrral cells ofterr attairr a rather more complete dcA clopuicnt.

This is the first stsige of every chronic inflammation.” Phenomena.—Eegarding the modifications of colour, size, sensation, fimc- tion and temperatm-e, described as attendant on acute inflammation, it is to be obsen^ed that they are also present in chronic inflammation; differing, how- ever, in origin and in degxee, and often in order and combination. The colour is not always changed, unless the part affected be very superficial; and the redness is rather of the dull than of the bright hue, not depending on the rapid transmission of an increased quantity of bright blood, but rather on a congestive condition. The affected tissue may become pennanently discoloured, probably by the escape of large numbers of red blood-corpuscles thi-ough the Avails of the A^essels, and the retention of their coloiu’ing matter after the removal of the more fluid parts of the effusion. The pain is less frequently of the spontoneously acute character, but partakes more often of the character of tenderness, being elicited only by pressime : sometimes, however, the pain is very seA'cre. The increase of femperatw'e is but slight. Swelling is an early and most important sign in chronic inflammation. It depends less on the enlargement of the vessels than on the effusion which takes place, and the nutritive changes which may be said to constitute the distinctiA’e characteristic of the disease. The effused material consists partly of seriun and partly of plastic matter. The fonner may become absorbed ; or, in the case of serous membranes, it may remain distending the cavities which they hne, as in the joints. The plastic matter is more hablo to remain, and to lead to hypertrophy, or thickening and induration of the part. Like acute inflammation, the chronic form of the disease may be attended with siqypuratim. This Avill be described in the next chapter. (Pages 140 —144.) In chrome inflainmation of mucous or serous membranes, there may be an increase Avith modification of the secretions ; producing, in the case of the mucous membranes, the condition knowm as chronic catarrh. Constitutional Symptoms.—These are less marked in chronic than in acute mflammation ; but if the disease assume an acute chai-acter, one of the forms of inflammatoiy fever already described may appear. The patient’s health, hOAvever, is m most cases impaired ; being, in many instances, affected with some constitutional taint Avhich has had its influence in producing or main- mmng the chronic character of the inflammation. If an important organ be ^ chronic inflammation, though affecting parts not essential to 1 c, e very extensiAe, the pulse will be found to be habitually above the normal standard, and exacerbations of fever, often of a distinctly periodic character, develop themseh-es. pciiouio in-^Lor’AYhSrif ^ presence of some local imtat.on, Avhich, if temporary, Avould produce acute inflammation only, but OTtaiiiimlof chror-'fl M Uie 8crofulons; indeed, very common in .ecrofnlouTtl!j2eto!“’’ ™INFLAMMA TION. 136 Treatment.—The treatment of ebrouie inflammation is far more diiflcult, and requires much more attention, than that of the acute fonn of the disease. Chronic inflammation is so frequently complicated Avith various imhealthy conditions of the system, and -wath an impaired state of the general health, by ■which, indeed, it is often kept up, that much practical tact and skill ai’e re- quired in caiTying out the therapeutic indications properly. Constitutional Treatment of Chronic Inflammation.—In the treat- ment of chronic inflammation we have not so much to subdue inflammatory action, as to remove structimal changes and other effects induced by it. Hence, om- object is not to produce a great and sudden impression on the system, as we are often required to do in the treatment of the acute affection. It is not in this way that chi’onic inflammation can ever be cined, or its effects removed. The patient might be bled almost to death, and still the diseased action would go on in the inflamed part. It is true that the same antiphlogistic means are employed in arresting the chronic as in cutting short the acute form of the disease, but they are used in a less energetic mamier; our object being to induce a gradual and continuous improvement in the state of the system and of the diseased part. Local nutrition is always deeply modified in chronic inflammation ; and it can only be restored to its normal condition by improv- ing the patient’s general health, as ■well as by producing an impression on the part itself by appropriate topical means. Hence, in the treatment of chronic inflammation, hygienic measures are of the first consequence. In most cases, nothing can be done without proper attention to these ; and much can be done by these that caimot be affected by any more dhect medicinal means. The treatment of this form of inflammation must like^wise be varied according as it is uncompheated, occiUT-ing in an otherwise healthy constitution, and assuming a sthenic type ; or as it occins in a cachectic and feeble system, assuming a congestive or passive character ; or as it is met with in an unhealthy constitu- tion, affecting a specific form. In the management of these various forms of chronic inflammation the patient must be kept at rest, and, if the disease be at all extensive, confined to bed. He should be in j)ure air, and, as a general ride, have a light and mi stimula ting diet. The regulation of the diet is of much consequence, and the amount and quality of the noinishment afforded must be carefully pro- portioned to the age, strength, and previous habits of the patient, as well as to the degree and the seat of the inflammation, and the foiTn of constitutional fever that accompanies it. In the more active form of chronic inflammation, farinaceous slops, at most beef-tea, and light puddings, can alone be allowed.^ In the less active forms occun-ing in feeble constitutions, ■\\nth depression of general power, animal food of a light kind may be given, and the scale of nom’ishment increased until stimulants, as beer, wine, or brandy, aie allcHed. Nothing requires gTeater nicety in practice than to proportion the diet, and to determine the cases in which stimulants are necessary. It may be stated generally that, the more the disease assumes the asthenic and passii’c forms, the more are stimulants required ; until, at last, in the tiuly adynamic type, our pnncipal trust is in these agents, and large.quantities of nine.

Mercury is of essential service in the more active forms of clnonic in tim137 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. mation ; but in all cachectic and stnunous constitutions it should, as much as possible, be avoided. It is of great use not only in airesting the further progress of the disease, but especially in causing the absorption of the effusions, and in removing some of the other effects of ckronic inflammation, such as thickening, hardening, and opacity of the parts. It should be given in small doses for a considerable length of time, until the gums are slightly affected. In many cases of depressed power it may be A'ery advantageously conjoined with bark or sarsaparilla. The most useful preparations ai-e calomel in half- gi'ain or gi’ain doses, and the iodide of mercury in the same quantities ; or, if a gradual and continuous effect be required, the perchloride in doses from one- sixteenth to one-eighth of a grain. Iodide of potassium is an alterative and absorbent of the greatest value, especially in the ckronic inflammations of fibrous or osseous tissues, or of the glands, ocemring in strumous constitutions. In these it may often be substi- tuted mth great advantage for meremy, and given in those cases in which that mineral would otherwise be administered. In many cases it is of essential service after a merem-ial com-se; some days should, however, be allowed to elapse after the mercury is discontinued before the iodide is given, otherwise profuse sahvation or even sloughing of the gimis may result. Sarsaparilla is a veiy valuable remedy if obtained good, and forms an ad- mirable vehicle for the preparations of meremy or iodine. The fluid extract of red Jamaica sarsaparilla, carefrilly prepared, is that to which I give the prefer- ence ; and where the inflammation is associated with want of power, its value is certaiidy very gi'eat. Cod-liver oil is of the very gTeatest value in the various strumous forms of clnonic inflammation in debilitated, emaciated, and cachectic subjects. It may be gi^en in some vehicle, such as milk, orange-wine or jiuce, that covers its taste. In some cases it is advantageously conjoined vdth the iodide of potassium , or, vheie there is much want of power, and stnunous aucemia is present, with the preparations of iron. It is more particularly in children and young people that it is of service in remonng the various effects of chronic inflammation. _ P^gatives are often required in chronic inflammation. In robust subjects in whom the disease is active, salines may be employed; to which, if there be a rheumatic tendency, colchicum may advantageously be added. As a toCneia 111 e, vaim aperients, such as the compound decoction of aloes, with Eochelle salt, ansvnr best; and in children a powder composed of one part of meremy and chalk, two of carbonate of soda, and foin of rhubarb, will be Jound very serviceable. f heatment of Chronic IxFLAiMMATioN.—111 cliroiiic inflammation the ™ ‘Itan m the acute form of eiTOiiio •>}' scarification, leechiii!!', or applicatioVL™ md m t-epeathig thisINFLAMMA TION. 13S Warmth and Moisture are not so sen'iceablo in chronic as in acute in- flammation, and care should be taken that they be not continued for so long^ a time as to sodden the parts. An astringent or stimulant, such as licpior plumbi or spirits of n'ine, may oftcu advantageously be added to the warm application. Cold is seldom required in any but the advanced stages of chronic inflam- mation, in which there arc debihty and passive congestion of the vessels of the part. In order to remove this state of things, its application should not be continuous, but should be made twice or thrice a day, so as to occasion a sudden shock, and produce a constringent effect upon the enfeebled vessels of the part. This is best done by pumping or pouring cold water from a height, or by douching, and shoidd be followed by active friction with the hands. rriction is often of great service in some of the forms of congestive inflam- mation, by the removal of the thickening, stiffening, and indination that result. Friction may be practised either with the naked hand, or Avith some embrocation of a stimulating or absorbent character. Counter-irritants are amongst the most energetic local means that Ave possess for combating chronic inflammation. Rubefacients, in the shape of stimulating embrocations, to which absorbents, such as mercurial ointment, may often advantageously be added, are usefully employed as adjuncts to friction. By means of blisters applied either directly OA'er the inflamed part, or at a little distance from it, the surface being kept raAV and exuding by some stimu- lating appheation, effusions and those chronic structural changes that accom- pany the more advanced stages of inflammation may be remoA'ed. In the latter stages of chronic inflammation, ]Axq pyogenic counter-irritants: —issues, setons, and the cautery—^may be very advantageously employed. By these a powerful derh'ative action is induced, and chronic thickening may be melted aAvay. Issues are of especial service in chronic inflammation of the Auscera, joints, and bones, before suppuration has taken place. They should be apphed in the soft parts over the affected structiues, and may be kept open for a very con- siderable length of time. They are best made in the following manner. A piece of common adhesiA'e plaster, about two inches square, haAlng a hole of the size of a shilling cut in its middle, is fixed upon the part where the issue is to be made ; a piece of potassa fusa, about the size of half a cherry-stone, is then placed on the siuface left uncovered by the circular central apertiue, a square piece of plaster being laid over all. The patient experiences a binning pain for about tAVO hours, when it ceases ; on remoA’ing the plasters, a black slough, corresponding in size to the central aperture, Avill be found. This must be poulticed for a fcAV days, until it separates, and the raAV surface then diesscd AAuth saA'ine ointment, or stimulated by an issue-bead. heneA'er it shoAvs a tendency to heal, it may be kept open by an occasional ajAplication of the potassa fusa, • A Seton is more useful than an issue Avhen counter-iiTifration is to be apphed over very deep-seated parts.

The cauterising irons may be of yai’ious shapes. They should be heated to a dull red heat, and then quickly drawn in lines, crossing one another, over the part. Astringents directly applied to the inflamed ^larts are of extreme service in those forms of congestive or passive inflammation in which the circulation is. sluggish and the cajiillaries loaded; they afford relief in these cases by inducing" conti-action of the vessels. In order to ensure their proper action, they must be employed of sufficient strength; for if too weak they irritate, and increase rather than relieve the congested condition. The nitrate of silver is the astrin- gent that IS commonly ineferred ; and this, apphed either solid, or in solution containing frorn ten gTains to one drachm of the salt in one ounce of distilled pl ater will produce a very marked beneficial influence in congestive inflamma- tion ot the mucous and cutaneous smfaces. _ Pressure by means of well-applied bandages, elastic webbing, or strapping, IS of essential semce in supporting the feeble vessels in congestive inflam- pressure may be advantageously conjoined with absorteuts and rubefacients, as mercurial and camphor liniments, or tho Hnii *^i finimoniacum.

SUPPURATION AND ABSCESS. SuppuEATiox, or tliG formation of pus, has aUeady been referred to in the last chapter, as one of the results of inflammation. It consists, in flict, as will be presently described, of a continuance and exaggeration of one of the factors •of inflammation—the excessive formation of white cells. Characters op Pus.—Pus presents considerable variety in its general •character, according to the natime of the patient’s constitution, or the con- dition of the part in which it is formed. When formed in a person of healthy constitution, as the result of sthenic inflammation, it is an opacpie, creamy fluid, thick, smooth, and slightly ;glutinous to the touch ; of a yellowish-white colour, with a greenish tinge, ha\ing a faint odoim, and an alkaline reaction. Its siDeciflc gramty is from 1030 to 1033. Chemically, it contains various albiuniiious compounds, with fatty matters, and salts, chiefly chloride of sodium ; it usually gives off a small ■quantity of ammonia. Pus presenting these characters is termed liealtJuj or laudable. When admixed and tinged vuth blood, pus is said to be sanious; when thin, watery, and acrid, ichorous; when containing cheesy-looking flakes, it is termed ■curdy; and when diluted with mucus or serum, it is frequently called muco- pus, or sero-pus. Besides these, pus presents many other varieties. Thus, for instance, when formed fr’om bone, or in the neighbomfrood of the alimentaiy canal, it has a peculiar fetid odoim. Its chemical composition may likevdse vary under different circumstances : thus, ordinary pus formed in the soft pai’ts •contains merely a trace of phosphate of lime, whereas that which is formed in •connection with diseased bone has been found by B. Cooper to contain 2? per cent, of this salt. Pus presents other peculiarities, which are oidy cognisable by them effects on the system: thus, the pus from speciflc sores possesses cou- fagious properties, though in chemical, microscopical, and physical constitu- tion, it does not differ from other forms of that fluid. Microscopic Characters.—On examining pus mider the microscope, it is fomid to consist of corpuscles floating in a homogeneous fluid, the “ liquor piu is. These corpuscles, about -jj-Au -s-oVo of ^’^loh in diameter, are composed ot a semi-transparent cell-wall, containing two or three nuclei, which are rendered very apparent by acetic acid (Fig- 71). The appearance here described, how- ever, is that of the corpuscles in the dead state, after removal from the bodj, and when their temperatme has fallen. The researches ot "'i on Reckling- hausen, Schultze, and others, have shovm that these corpuscles (and the -white corpuscles of the blood) midergo changes of form like those of the amoc a.141 CHAJRACTEBS OF PUS. 'WIicii examined under favom-able circumstances, they are seen to shoot out jjrojcctions, and to withdraw them ; and it has also been found that, like the- imiocba, they have the power of incoiporatiug into their substance matters, such as pigments, with which they come into contact. Be- sides these corjniscles, granular mat- ter, particles of fibrine, and disin- tegrated cells, arc usually foimd admixed in gi’eatcr or less amount. The greater the quantity of cox-puscles, the- richer and more creamy is the pus. lu many cases, however, the microscopical characters of pus differ from those that have just been given. Thus, in the thin, greasy, yellovish-looking pus,. ■pig. 71.—a. Healthy Pus-cells. 6. Treated with Acetic Acid. Magnified 800 Diameters. Fig. 72.—Pus-cells from Pyaimic Abscess.

The diagnosis of pus is usually easy, but some fluids resemble pus so c osely to the naked eye, that the microscope is necessary to establish their characters. From healthij mucus there is no difficulty in distinguishiuo- pus , mt when mucus has been thickened and rendered opaque by inflamma- tion, and is mixed OTth exudation-celis, it is imi»saiblc, and can nerer be nccciMary to distingliish it from pus. TurKd serum, containing brokeii-domi an gianu ai filnine, fiequently met ivith in serous sacs, and softemd Jihrine, as m clots and inflamed vessels, are distinguished from pus by the absence of pus- cells. Atheroma is recognised by tlie presence of cholesterine-scales and tat, and by the non-existence of the characteristic pus-coi-puscle. In tulercle and cancer *^i -1^^ pus-cell, and the presence of appearances characteristic hlood establish the diagnosis.

The older oni'geons belie\ed that this fluid was formed by the Ijreaking up or disintegra- tion of the solid tissues, or that it was the result of their liquefaction or saponi- fication by the fluid products of inflammation. Hewson and Hunter exposed the fallacy of these opinions; and modern pathologists look upon pus as a ■direct product of inflammation. When siqjpm’ation takes place, there is indeed a brealcing up of the tissues ; but it is not their mere debris which constitutes pus. The close resemblance between the white blood-corpuscles and those of pus was pointed out as long ago as 1842, by Dr. W. Addison, and subsequently by Dr. A. Waller, but their observations seem to have been almost forgotten until about eight years ago, since Avhich time an interesting investigation has been carried on by several observers, as to the source of the pus-corpuscles, and the manner in which their numbers become increased. The researches on this point have an intimate coimection uith those to w'hich reference was made in the previous chapter, on the behaviom- of the white corpuscles of the blood in inflammation. The mode of fomiation of pus has been examined by Cohnheim, Hoffinami, and Von Recklinghausen, in the cornea of the frog—a non-vascular tissue. On injm-ing the cornea, there follows in two or three days a yellomsh opacity, due to pus-corpuscles, and commencing always, according to Cohnheim, at the periphery, even Avhen the lesion is central. The pus, it is hence inferred, ■cannot have been formed in the cornea, but must hax'e come from Avithout; but from AA'hat soiuce ? It had been shoAAii that finelj^ divided colomlng matter, when brought into contact AAoth cells, such as those of pus, is taken up and retained by them. Accordingly Cohnheim introduced anihne blue, and Hoffinann and Von Recklinghausen cimaabar, into the blood ; and, on after- wards examining the pus, foimd it colom-ed by these substances, AA'hich had been taken up by its corpuscles. On introducing the same substances into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the injiucd cornea, no such effect Avas produced. Hence the inference Avas, that at least many of the pus-cells come fr’om the blood. It is still a debated question, whether aU, or eA'en the majority, of the pus- corpuscles ai’e to be accounted for by migration of white cells or leucocytes, as they have been called, thi’ough the AA'alls of the blood-vessels. That this is the somce of most of them, Avas the vieAv held by Cohnlieim, Avho regarded the blood-forming organs—the spleen and lymphatic glands—as their nlthnate source. Others, hoAACver, including Billroth, Hoflmaim, and Von Reckling- hausen, consider that a large proportion of the pus-cells must be formed in the tissues outside the Acssels, especially in the corpuscles of the connective tissue. This vieAV is that Avhich appears to be most generally received. Bm-don Sanderson remai'ks that “ in every limited inflanmiation of the subcutaneous tissue, and in the neighboiu’hood ot every subcutaneous abscess, a region is foimd outside of the focus of suppuration, in Avhich the connective tissue corpuscles present alterations Avhich are so distinct, that it is impossible for any one Avho is com’ei’sant Avith them to doubt that they signify that the tissue is germinating.” Kelation of Suppuration to other Changes in the Tissues, The143 TENDENCY TO SUPPURATION. essential characteristic of suppm-atioii is, as has been shown, the development in excessive number of corpuscles closely resembling, if not indeed identical with, the colom-less corpuscles of the blood. It is dependent on inflammation, although in some cases, such as the “ cold abscess ” to be hereafter described, the other phenomena of iuflaunnation may be very slightly marked; and it therefore is foimd to occur along with the other tissue-changes, whether of repair or of destruction, which are connected vdth inflammation. The process of repair of injiu'ies, as will be described hereafter, is attended in general by more or less of inflammation, under which a supply of organisable fibrinous matter or lymph is thrown out, and undergoes conversion into cica- tricial tissue. Very frequently—especially under exposm’e to the air—suppura- tion takes place at the same tune. In an ordinarily healthy subject, this plastic or adhesive inflammation gradually gains ground, and, overcoming the tendency to suppiu-ation, closes the woimd. In such cases the pus, so long as it is formed, is of the “healthy” or “laudable” kind. And though the suppuration is by no means essential to the process of repair, still the presence of pus of this kind indicates a healthy condition of the system and of the part. In other cases, especially in cachectic or specifically diseased states of the system, the material efiused fr’om the blood-vessels is deficient in plastic pro- perty, neither repaying the woimd nor forming “ laudable ” pus ; but con- sisting of a thin serous fluid containing corpuscles. This iviU be again refeiTed to in Chapter VII., in describing the process of “ Union by Adhesive Inflam- mation.” CiRCUMSTAXCES IXELUEXCING- THE TeXDEXCY TO SUPPURATION.—Why do the adhesive or fibrinous products of inflammation preponderate in some cases, and the suppurative or corpuscular in others ? This question has been closely investigated by Hunter, Bichat, Kokitansky, and 0. J. B. Williams, and has been very clearly answered by Sir James Paget, who has pointed out that toe difierence is dependent on tlu’ee causes1. The state of the blood ; 2. e seat of the inflammation ; 3. The degTee and chai-acter of the inflam- mation. 1. State of the Blood.—Paget apphed blisters to thirty chfferent patients, lid eoUected the scro-fibrmous fluid that aecumulated in the blebs.

ThusSUPPURATION AND ABSCESS. 144 in diplifclicria and croup, lymph is poiu’od onfc on the mncons membrane of the throat; whilst, in empyema, pus is fonned in the cavity of the pleima. 3. The Degree and Character of the inflammation modify considerably the product. ^ When the inflammation is of an active sthenic character in a healthy constitution, it requires considerable intensity to give rise to suppuration. It IS only where the system is strongly predisposed by struma or cachexy, that very slight inflammations terminate in this way. The degree of inflammation required for the formation of pus varies gveatly, but it is always greater than that necessary for plastic exudation. Certain forms of inflammation are always attended by specific products. In pyemia, for instance, all the products have a snppmative tendency, even Avheu serous membranes are inflamed. In croup, on the other hand, there is a disposition to plastic effusion even on mucous sm’faces. The specific character of the inflammation often determines the supervention of suppination: some diseases, such as gonon-hoea and purulent ophthalmia, consisting essentially in the secretion of pus by a free surface. 4. In addition to the conditions above mentioned, the Local Condition of "the Fart influences the probabihty of suppuration. Thus a subcutaneous wound, as in tenotomy, does not suppmate ; but if it be opened, and its interior exposed to the air, then suppination takes place. For the same reason all iflccrs snppinate. The lodgment of foreign bodies, as of mine, a piece of bone, or a bullet, by exciting intense and continuous inflammation, almost inevitably leads to suppination, which is indeed the means adopted by natine for their removal from the system. The DURATION of suppination varies greatly. Inflammation I’ery commonly terminates in the formation of pus, in the coinse of about thi’ce days ; at other times a much longer period than this is required, the inflammatory action being passive and languid. When once siqipination has been set up, it may continue for an indefinite time ; the forma tion of pus-ceUs becoming, as it were, the estab- lished condition of the part. It is not micommon to find pmulent discharges fr’om mucous membranes continuing for years. Symptoms op Suppuration.—These are local and constitutional. The Local Symptoms differ as the suppuration occurs on a mucous surface, or in the interior of a tissue or organ. When an inflamed mucous surface is about to suppmate, the membrane pre- sents the ordinary characters of active inflammation, being hot, swollen, red, and often painful; to these a discharge is speedily superadded. When suiipuration is about to take jilace in the snlstance of tissues or orr/ans, so as to give rise to an abscess in one of the forms to be presently described, the local symptoms of inflammation imdergo certain modifications indicative of the supervention of this action. The pain becomes throbbing; the part swells and becomes tense, but after a time softens ; and fluctuation or undulation may be detected in it. The skin becomes glazed, red, shiny, and cedematous. In other cases, again, suppmation occurs without any erident sign of local inflam- mation, the presence of the pus revealing itself by swelling and fluctuation only. Coustitutional Symptoms.— On the supervention of extensive suppuration the ordinary symjitoms of inflammation subside, and arc usually internqitcd by the occurrence of chills, alternation of heat and cold, or, if the fonnation of pus be extensive, by severe and long-continued rigors. The fever often assumes a145 HECTIC, ABSCESS. somewhat intermittent character, and its intensity lessens, the pulse becoming- soft, though quick. The temperature is habitually above normal and rises considerably, perhaps up to 104 F., with tolerable regularity at one period of the day, and especially during the occiuTcnce of rigors. If pus be formed in sufficient quantity for its discharge to act as a severe di-ain on the constitution, other symptoms set in, dependent on the loss that is going on. The patient becomes Aveak, the nutrition is impaired, and hectic is established. Hectic does not come on unless there be a discharge of pus from the system. No hectic occiu-s so long as an abscess, however large, continues unopened; but it may supervene vdth great rapidity when once its contents are discharged. I have known large abscesses to exist unopened for several years, AAuthout any constitutional disturbance; but, as soon as they were opened, well-marked hectic set in, which speedily carried off the patient. Hectic is essentially a fever of debihty, conjoined vdth irritation. Emacia- tion and general loss of power invariably accompany it. The pulse, which is quick, small, and compressible, rises from ten to twenty beats above its normal standard ; the tongue becomes red at the edges and tip ; the cheeks are often flushed, and the eyes glistening, Avith dilated pupils ; all these symptoms have <i tendency to exacerbations after meals and towards evening. There is also increased action, either of the skin, bowels, or kidneys. Thus, profuse sweating, copious pinging, and abundant deposits of lithates in the mine take place ; these dischai’ges often alternate with one another, as it were, melting the patient away, and hence are termed coUiquative. The debility gradually increasing, the patient rapidly wastes, and at last dies from sheer exhaustion, the conjoined result of fever, mahxutritiou, and wasting discharges. In some cases of extensive suppination, especially in childicn, hectic does not occm, but marasmus or atrophy takes place Avith amyloid degeneration of the viscera,, more especially the liver, the child Avasting away Avithout fever, and being carried off at last by exhaustion or some interemnent disease. SuiApuration may occm on the mucous or serous surfaces, or on the surfaces cf ulcers or Avounds, constituting Purulent Secretion or Exudation; or pus may be collected m the interior of a tissue of an organ, forming an Alscess. n Abscess signifies a collection of jms occurring in any of the tissues or organs 0 t e body. In structme, an abscess consists of an accumula- tion of pus situated in the midst of, and smrounded on all sides by, a layer of bmic deposited in and consolidating the neighbouring tissues. This lymph, I 1C cons 1 utes t e tuall of the abscess, varies greatly in thickness and con- perceptible, in others some hues in mrf- ° coiTcsponding firmness, constituting perhaps the principal part of the mass This wall of ‘qimitiug fibrine ” is veiy vascular in roZZ-Ll H-estaoZ’mto Hi-Tv. f ^ into various kinds, accordino-to the .mptorns attending them, their duration, and their cause.

If the abscess be yery deeply seated, the super- imposed tissues become brawny and oedematous, without, perhaps, any other sign indicating the existence of pus. As the swelling approaches the surface, it softens at one pait, 'where fluctuation becomes perceptible, and a bulging of the skin covering its siunmit takes place ; this^JO'W?/wj^ of ilia ahscess indicates that it is about to bimst and discharge its contents, which it speedily 'will through a circular aperture foiTued in the skin. The intimate pathological phenomena attending the fomation of an abscess are as follow^s. In the nrflamed part, a collection of white cells takes place in the areolar- tissue aird gradually increases ; meamvhile, the proper tissue of the part is broken down and removed, or its shreds may remain mixed with the pus. The tissue lying beyond this collection of pus is very vascular, and is in- filtrated with new plastic matter, which, in healthy states of the system, forms a layer of “hmitiirg fibrine ” or “limitiirg membrane.” An abscess, perhaps originally deeply formed in the substairce of a hmb, increases by the additions of cells from the blood-vessels of the hmiting mem- braire, and also probably from the action of the aheady existing amoeboid cells in the tissues rvith which they come into contact. As the abscess extends, it has a special tendency to approach a fr-ee siu-face, wdrether that be external or internal, skin or mucous membrane ; the tissues betw'een it and the smface tow'ards which it is progressing being gradually broken dow-n, at the same time that the formation of cells is increased by the continuance of the inflammatory process in this direction. It is in this that the 2^oinM>i[i essentially consists.. As the abscess approaches the sm-face, the skin at fii-st becomes more or less h^id, tense, and oedematous, indicating the interference with its circulation; as the summit of the abscess presses upwards, the 03'erlying skin loses its tension and becomes relaxed ; it then sloughs at the most central point, fr-om which the cuticle has previously peeled off, and, the outw-ard pressure of the pus speedily detaching the slough, the abscess discharges itself. Though acute abscesses, if left to themseh’es, usually run this course and binst through the skin, the mucous or serous surfaces, or even into the interior of joints, yet some collections of pus, if very deeply seated, caimot find their way to the sinface, but extend through the areolar planes of the hmb in a lateral direction, bin- rowing and undermining the jDarts to a gi-eat extent; or, if situated in densu and unyielding structines, as in bone, are imprisoned within a case through which they may be unable to penetrate; in other rare instances, the pus becomes absorbed, and the abscess disappeai-s. After an abscess has burst or has been evacuated, its w^alls, wiiich have a close resemblance to a granulating surlhco,. contract and become coiTUgated, and gradually close the cai'ity; in some cases, how'ever, the cavity docs not completely close, but contracts into a narrow' canal,, foi-ming a sinus or fistula (p. 158). Diffuse Abscess foi-ms rapidly in the areolar tissue, as the result of diffuse inflammation. There is no limiting fibrine, and hence the jais often spreads w'idely, iiroducing extensive destruction of parts before it is discoi'ered. A particular variety of this form of abscess is the Pimyeral, occurring in women after parturition in various parts of the body, especially in the iliac fossa, in147 VARIETIES OF ABSCESS. the iiroolar i^lanes of the thigh or in the joints, and in the adipose tissue of the orbit, often destroying the globe of the eye. To these forms of the disease the KetSistaitic Abscesses are closely allied. They commonly occiu’ as conse- quences of pyaemia, are very nmnerous, and are met with in the substance of organs as well as in the areolar tissue and joints. The last three species of abscess are A'arieties of the acute form. Chronic Abscesses are of very common occinTence. The tissue in the vici- nity of a piece of dead bone being iiTitated by its presence, or a gland or some portion of the snbcutaneons areolar tissue having become indicated tender or snbacntely inflamed, at last, slowly and without any constitutional symptoms, or much appearance of local disturbance except the swelling, softens and breaks doMm into a somewhat thin, flaky, curdy, pnriform fluid, though in some instances the pus is perfectly healthy. These abscesses do not readily point, but often extend laterally, biUTovdng for a considerable distance from their original seat. In other cases they become circumscribed by a thick and dense wall of fibrine, through which it may be extremely difficidt, and perhaps impossible, to detect fluctuation ; the disease then simulating a sohd tmnoiu. The diuation of these chi’onic abscesses without opening is often very remark- able, even when situated in soft parts. I have seen large chronic abscesses, in the iliac ^ fossa and groin, perfectly stationary for nearly two years. When situated in denser structiues, as in the substance of the breast, the wvall may liccome so dense as to resemble a cyst, and the disease wiU continue in the same state for a gi-eat length of time. In the bones, abscesses may exist for an indefimte period. Cold, Lyinphatic or Congestive Abscess often occm-s with but slight pre- cursory locas^unptoms, or even without any at all. The patient, who has usually * been cachectic, and has suffered some time fr-om general debihty, feels slight un- casmess m the gi-oin ihac fossa, or axiUa, and finds suddenly a large fluctuatino- noui in one of these situations ; there is perhaps no pain in the part and ‘Tfsuch an abscass as this, theie will usually be a copious discharge of thin unhealthy pus, which when examined under the microscope, vail be found to contain iU-developed withered looking matter, probably sero-plastic effusion. ^ ^ Abscess, which contains ?as as well as •tuCantair'' ^ rf of the mucons ianals, chiefly hoinetimes the communication with the intesHriP i'b -ft.. • hi, * to old age.

Jocular, tlie different cysts being connected by narrow channels of communica- tion ; in tliis way I have seen a lai’ge abscess extending from the lumbar Tertebrse through the iliac fossa down the thigh, the ham, and the leg, imtil at last it was opened by the side of the tendo Achillis, forming five or six dis- tinct cysts, communicating with one another by contracted channels (Fig. 74). Effects.—The pressure-effects of an abscess are often important. By pres- siu’e on the nerves of a part, it may give rise to very severe pain and spasm at a distance from its seat. The pains occasioned by the pressme of some forms of chronic abscess ujDon neigh- bom’ing nerves, have been mistaken for those of rheumatism or neiualgia. When blood-vessels come into relation vdth an abscess, they usually become coated by a thick layer of lymph, which pro- tects them from injury. In- some cases, however, they are obliterated by the conjoined effects of the iwessiue and the inflammation, in which they as well as the adjacent tissues partake. In other cases, more particularly in strumous and cachectic indmduals, the blood- vessels, not havmg been guarded by lymph, have ulcerated and biust into the cyst of the abscess, occasioning sud- den and dangerous or even fatal hemor- rhage (p. 158). It is seldom, however, that a large artery or vein pom'S its contents into an abscess that has not been opened. These occiuTences ha\e chiefly taken place in the neck, in which situation both the carotid aiteiy, as in a case described by Liston, and the internal jugular vein, have opened into the cyst of an abscess. The various mucous canals, especially the trachea and the luethra, may be injiuiously compressed by neighbouring abscesses; so also bones may become necrosed, and joints inflamed and destroyed, fr-om the same C9^I1SG Diagnosis —The diagnosis of abscess, though usually easily made, at tunes requires close attention. The Surgeon believes that an acute abscess is about to form when, after rigors and some modification of the mfliuumatory fever, he finds the local signs characteristic of the formation of pus ; more especially a throbbing pain in the part, mth softening of any induration that may have ■pig. 74.—Large Psoas ALscess extending down the Thigh and Leg. existed, and oedema of the areolar tissue covering it.

The fluctuation may, however, readily be confounded with the undulatoiy sensation conmnniicated by some tissues from the mere inflltration of sero-i)lastic fluid into them, or even without this, fr-om their natimal laxity, as is sometimes the case in the areolar tissue of the nates and thigh in persons of lymphatic temperament. This, indeed, is a difference of degi'ce rather than of kind ; as pus woidd make its appearance in the coiu’se of a few hoiu’s, if the tumour were left to itself. The mere occiuTencc of fluctuation, however, is not of itself sufficient to determine more than that a fluid exists in the part. The question necessarily arises, is this fluid pus ? In the majority of instances, the history of the case, the character of the pain, the previous existence and the continuance of symptoms of inflammation, enable the Surgeon to answer in the affinnative. But if, as in chi’onic or cold abscesses, there be only obscure evi- dence of inflammation having existed, and if the swelling be of long standing, the fluctuation being perhaps deeply seated and indistinct, the safer plan will be for the Siu’geon to introduce an exploring needle, and to see what the true nature of the fluid is; by this simple means many embarrassing mistakes in diagnosis may be avoided. The tiunoin's with wliich abscesses may more easily be confounded, are those- soft solid (jroioths in which there is a high degree of elasticity, giving rise to a species of undulation, as in some kinds of encephaloid tumour. Fluid tumours of various kinds, such as cysts and enlarged bursie, also may be confounded with abscesses. In these cases the previous symptoms, the situation, and the general appearance and feel of the tumom, will usually enable the Smgeon to effect a ready diagnosis ; but should any doubt exist, the exploring needle or trochar must be introduced, when, if pus be present, a di'op or two wiU escape. The “suction-trochar” (Fig. 75), or the “asphator,” is of especial service in cases m M-hich it IS desirable to withdraw some of the contained fluid for closer ex-amina ion. he diaguosis of an abscess haring pulsation communicated to it y a supacent aiteiy, from an aneurism, will be discussed when we come to rig.

Ihe cause of the abscess also influences the result; if it be a piece of dead bone that can be removed, the discharge will speedily cease if the frag- ment be taken away, but if it be so situated that it cannot be got rid of, it will, by acting as a continuous soincc of irritation, keep up a discharge that may e\entually prove fatal. The constitution of the patient influences our piognosis. Such an amount of discharge as w’^ould inevitably prove fatal in a cachectic system, may influence a sound one but very little; so also, the w’astiiig effect of an abscess is better borne about middle age than at either of the extreme periods of hfe. Treatment.—The treatment of suppiu-ation presents three points requiring attention. The first object should be to prevent the formation of matter ; tlic next to take steps for its evacuation when formed; and the last to endeavour to close the cavity that results. In order to prevent the formation of matter, it is necessary to get rid of any local irritant that may exist; thus dead bone should be removed, or extravasated lU’ine let out of the areolar tissue. After this has been done, the qifeventive treatment must consist in the active emifloyment of local antiphlogistic means, such as ice and cold evaporating lotions: any slight tendeniess that con- tinues after the inflammation has subsided must be removed ; and the swelling from exudation-matter, which is especially the preem’sor of chronic abscess, must be got rid of by the continuous appheation of some discutient lotion. One composed of iodide of potassimn 5i., spirits of wane 3i., water svij., is extremely usefrd ; in some cases absorption may advantageously be promoted by mercm’ial ointments or plasters. When once pus has formed, it is a question whether it can be absorbed again; in general, it certainly caimot, more especially if once a distinct cyst have formed aroinid it, but in some cases it may undergo absorption; thus, in hypopyon, w-e occasionally observe that the pus deposited in the anterior chamber of the eye is removed; and I think it probable that the same may happen when pus is inflltrated into the tissues of a part, without a very distinct wall siUTOunding it. The more fluid parts of chi-onic abscesses occasionally become absorbed, leaving a cheesy residue, which may degenerate into cretaceous matter. When, notwithstanding the employment of appropriate means, it is evident that pus is about to form, the treatment should be completely changed, and, by the aid of warmth and poultices, an endcavom’ should be made to hasten s>(2}- picration. When this is fully established, the abscess having become “ ripe,” steps must be taken for the evacuation of the matter. The treatment of acute and of chronic abscesses differs in some respects. In discussing the Treatment of Abscess, w^e shall consider, in the fii-st instance, its management by the methods ordinarily in use, and secondly, by the antiseptic plan. In the Acute Abscess, the matter should be let out as soon as it is fully formed, especially in those varieties of the disease connected with a morbid state of the system, as in the metastatic and pyemic forms. When this is done, the constitution at once experiences great rehef, the fever and general iiTitation subsiding materially ; the tree incision not only letting out the pus and lymph, but removing tension, and, by encoiu’aging local bleeding, lessening he inflammatory action. The rule of opening an acute abscess early is espe- cially imperative w-hen the pus is formed in the sheaths of the tendons andTREATMENT OF ABSCESS. i5r imtler fibrous expansions where there is much tension ; also when it is situated deeply in the areolar planes of a limb, under the larger muscles, where it has a tendency to diffuse itself extensively. In those cases, likewise, in which pus is lodged in close proximity to a joint or under the periosteum, it must be let out early; so also, when it presses upon mucous canals or important organs, as on the urethra or trachea, or when it is dependent on the infiltration of an imtant fluid into a part, as in minary extravasation, it must be evacuated without delay. The pus should always bo let out early, before the skin covering it is thimied, when the abscess is situated in the neck or in any other part where it is desirable that there should be as little scamng as possible. In Chronic Abscess, the rule of siu’gery is not so explicit. Here the collec- tion is often large, coming on ^vithout any very evident symptoms and giving rise to no material inconvenience; but, if it be opened, putrefaction of the pus, con- secjuent uiJon the entry of air- into the extensive cyst, vdll give rise to the most serious constitutional distiu’bance, setting up initative fever, or giving rise to pyemia ; and, should the patient escape this danger, the drain of an abundant suppmation may speedily waste him. Hence, it not uncommonly happens that a patient may cany a chronic abscess unopened, vdthont any very serious distinbanee, for many months or even years ; but when it is once opened, he dies in a few days. If, however, the chronic abscess be so small that no danger is to be apprehended from the inflammation of its cyst, or if it be situated in parts where it may give rise to dangerous pressure, the matter should be let out without delay. There are thi’ee modes by which abscesses may be opened, each of which possesses advantages in particular cases ;—these are InrAsion, Tcqjpmg with a trochar, and making an apertme into the cyst mth Caustic. Incision is the only plan that should be practised in acute abscesses. For this pinpose a laneet, an abscess-bistoiuy (Fig. 7G), or a sickle-shaped knife, maybe Fig. 76.—Abscess-Bistoury. used, incision should be made either at the point where fluctuation is most distinct, or at the most dependent part of the tumour, so as to prevent a ei ago mg of the matter. It should bo made by holding the bistoiuy or ancjc s 011, and introducing it perpendicularly into the softened part. If the depth to be reached be considerable, a bistoury should be used, the blade of m *1^ ^ -f n roimd after its introduction, when the pus wells flio 1 f coiititiued tor a modemto extent in the direction of hu t Illw , n “ f “llo"' tto "-'Ils of the abscess to collapse, Hit It Should not be forced out by squeezing the sac. ^ fill iSi Zd 1 the cavity of the abscess is ^vith blood by the rupture of some small vessel situated in its waUs; this,SUPPURATION AND ABSCESS. 152 llo^vever, is of little moment, the ha3mon’hage speedily eeasing on the apjdiea- tion of pressure, of a bandage, or of cold. Provided the incision have only to he canied tlu'ough the integiunental structures and fascia, in order to afford an outlet for the pus, there can be but little danger of hsemonhage from the accidental woimd of any blood-vessel of importance ; and, should bleeding occur, it will probably be of a venous chai-acter, and may bo aiTcsted by pressiu’e and position. But when the abscess is more deeply seated than this, lying under the superficial muscles, which it Avill then be necessary to penetrate, more serious consequences may ensue, and the incautious use of the knife may lead to the most perilous results. This is more particularly apt to occm- in deeply seated periosteal abscesses of the thigh and I have more than once known such profuse arterial hsemorrhage follow incisions made for the pm-pose of evacuating pus deeply lodged in the limb in these cases, as to necessitate the ligature of the femoral artery. In order to avoid this danger, Hilton has advised that abscesses so situated should be opened in the foUowng way. An incision is made through the integuments, and fascia so as to expose the muscle imder which the pus lies ; a director is. then pushed through the substance of the muscle into the cavity of the abscess,, and along the groove of this as a guide a slender pair of dressing-forceps is pushed: when it reaches the abscess the blades are opened up, the musculai- fibres sei3arated, and free exit given to the pus. After the opening has been made, a poultice or water-di’essing must be apphed. The ca\dty left eventually fills up either by the coalescence of its sides, or by granulating from below ; if it fill again Avith pus, a fresh incision, termed a “ counter-opening,” must be made in the most dependent part. No- thing is more dangerous than pent-up matter in imperfectly opened abscesses. It speedily decomposes and becomes offensive, gives rise to local irritation and inflammation, and predisposes to the occuiTence of erysipelas and pyaemia. In order to prevent these evil consequences, recoiu’se must be had to free openings in dependent situations, and the use of the drainage-tube. In the treatment of chronic and cold abscess, any one of these three plans may be employed for opening the sac. If it be small, an incision should be made into it at once. If the collection be considerable, we must Avait rmtil an opening has been rendered necessary by the tendency to impheation of the skin, or by injiu'ious pressure being exercised on important parts ; the pus should then be let out by the vahndar apertme recommended by Abernethy, the object being to limit the entry of air into the interior of the abscess, so as to lessen the chance of putrefaction of any pus that is left, and of consecutive inflammation of the cyst. The valvidar opening is made by drawing the skin covering the abscess avcU to one side, then passing the bistoury directly into the sac, and alloAAing as much of the pus to escape as will flow out by the collapse of the Avails of the abscess; before the matter has quite ceased to Aoaa, and conse- quently before any air can haA'e entered the sac, the skin should be alloAAcd to recover its natiu-al position, so that the aperture in it and in the cyst may no longer directly communicate. A piece of plaster, or ot lint soaked in co oc ion, should be placed upon the external wound, which will probably heal under this coA'ering in the course of a short time. When the cyst of the abscess las again filled somewhat, this process may be repeated; so that, less and less pus eingTREATMENT OF ClIRONIG ABSGESS. i53' allowed to accumulate iu it before each succeeding evacuation, it may gi-adually contract and close. Instead of making the valvular opening in this way, a chi'onic abscess may sometimes be advantageously opened by Tapping with a Trochar and Cannula of moderate size, the instrument being introduced obliquely between the skin and the abscess, and then made to dip doum into the sac. After the Avithch-awal of the cannula, the aperture may be closed as in the former case. There is, however, one disadvantage hi this plan of opening abscesses; that, if the discharge be cirndy or shreddy, it is very apt to block up the cannula or- tube, aud thus to interfere ivith the proper evacuation of the matter. The abscess may be emptied by the Aspirator, the entrance of air being thus effectually prevented. Potassa Fusa, though its application be painful, may be advantageously used for opening those chi’onic abscesses, the skin covering which is much luider- mined, congested, and discoloured. In these cases I commonly employ it with gi'eat advantage. It is also useful in the after-treatment, when much solid plastic matter is left, dissolving this away by exciting inflammation around it,, aud thus preventing the formation of sinuses which are otherwise apt to occiu’. In some forms of abscesses it vdll be found that those processes which are- necessary for the contraction and closure of the cyst, after its contents have- been evacuated, do not readily take place ; and it becomes necessary to have recom-se to other measiu’es, iu order to excite sufficient healthy inflammatory action to bring about the closime of the cyst of the abscess. With this view,, a Seton of two or three threads may very usefully be passed across the cyst by means of a nmvus-needle, or by a long straight needle pushed up through the cannula used for tapping (Fig. 77). It should be left in for a few days, by Fig. 77.—Introduction of Seton into Abscess tlirough Cnnnula. which time healthy inflammation -will be set’ up. In other cases again, after the cyst has been tapped, the red wash or some tincture of iodine should be injected and left in. These methods of exciting inflanmiation are especiallj" meful when the cyst-wall is thin, and of a very chronic character. When the walls are very thick and dense, as sometimes happens iu abscesses of very old standing situated in the neck, an elliptical piece of the anterior portion of the cyst should be dissected out, and the cavity lightly dressed with lint, and allowed to fill by granulation. This plan of treatment is often very successful; and I lave by it cured abscesses in the neck of seven or eight years standino- which have resisted every other plan employed.SCPFURATJOy and ABBCES^.

The diainage-tube is especially useful in the treatment of chronic abscesses, i his instrument is used in the follmving way. The abscess hanng been punc- •tm-ed, a small India-rubber tube, one-sixth of an inch in diameter, having several side holes punched in it, is passed into the ca'sdty, one end being allowed to hang out for the pus to di'ain away. These tubes may very con- veniently be introduced by being fixed on to the end of a forked probe (Figs. 78, 79), by which the tube is carried into the abscess and left there on the withdi'awal of the probe. Another plan con- sists in passing the perforated India-rubber tube comjDletely across the abscess, draMnng it out through a counter-opening, and tying the two ends together. By this contrivance the pus is carried off by the side of rather than through the tube as cpiickly as it is secreted, the walls of the abscess collapse, and, as gradual closiwe takes place, the tube may be withdrawn. In some cases the drainage-tubes haA'e appeared to me to act in another Avay than by merely remoA'ing the purulent secretion ; A'iz., by irritating the wall of the abscess just as a sc ton would, and thus setting up increased activity, and materially aug- menting the discharge. On their Avithch’aAA^al, however, this stimulation has been found to be beneficial, causing a speedier closure of the suppiuating cyst. The antiseptic treatment has been successfully applied of late years by Lister, of Edinbiu’gh, to the treatment of both acute and chi’onic abscesses. By its means all the advantages of a free opening, giving ready exit to the discharges, <can be obtained Avithout the dangerous consequences AAdiich often foUoAV the modes of treatment AAfrich have just been described. The practice is foimded upon the folloAAung principles :—1. The formation of pus, whether on the surface of a granulating sore or in the caAuty of an abscess, is due to the presence of some abnormal irritation of the tissues.—2. In the vast majority •of cases, the primary cause of the formation of an abscess is of a temporary character, its exact nature often being uncertain; in other cases a distinct cause may be readily found, as an injmy in an imhealthy subject, or the presence of an irritating foreign body.—3. The primary cause of the formation of an abscess being removed or haA'ing disappeared, the inltation caused by the tension of the parts in consequence of the accumulation of fluid is sufficient to cause the continuance of the process of siqApuration, and the pointing of the abscess.—4. If the cause of iiritation be removed and no other siqDplicd in its place, and if no other caiise that Avill still be present have co- existed Avith it, all suppuration Avill cease on the relief of tension by opening the abscess, the only discharge being of a serous nature, coming from the surface of the granulations lining the cavity of the abscess. If this discharge be pent up inAXTISEPTJG TREATMENT OF ABSCESS. iS5 tlio cavity, tension will be again produced, and, acting as an irritant, wdl cause IVesli suppuration; but if the discharge be allowed to drain away it will rapidly vliminish, and the sac of the abscess will be obliterated by the ordinary processes of contraction and cicatrisation. If dead bone exist at the bottom of the ca\ity of the abscess, the reparative process, iin'olving absorption of the dead bone, will be vciy slow, the serous discharge often continuing for months without change, nnlcss allowed to decompose, w'hen it will rapidly become pmulent and enoimously increased in quantity.—5. In the ordinary method of opening an abscess, although the irritation due to tension is removed, a fresh initant is admitted in the shape of the decomposition of the discharges, winch in the mildest cases will seriously delay the closing of the cavity of the abscess, while in many, such as large psoas or lumbar abscesses, it may lead to such an amomit of constitutional distmbance as to be rapidly fatal.—G. The cause of decom- position is not the admission of the gases of the air, but the presence of organic ^erms w'hich are constantly floating in the atmosphere, and whose acthity is readily destroyed by the presence in the air of a moderately strong vapour of carbolic acid, sulphm-ous acid, or some other volatile antiseptic. Lister, there- fore, in liis method of treatment aims at the following objects :—1st. The fr'ec opening of the abscess, so as completely to evacuate its contents, and to allow the free drain of discharges afterwards—that is to say, the complete removal of tension and the prevention of its retmm ; 2nd, the entire exclusion from the opening into the abscess of ordinary air unmixed with a strong vapour of carbolic acid or other volatile antiseptic body; and 3rd, the absorption by some porous material impregnated with a pow^erful antiseptic, of all discharges as soon as they escape from the wound—in short, the prevention of decomposition in the sac of the abscess, or in the discharges lying about the W’ound. The antiseptic w'hich Lister has foimd the most convenient for these pin-poses is carbolic acid. The treatment requires great care in management, and must be considered with minute attention to all its details. The materials required are a solution of carbolic acid in water (1 to 40), and a solution of olive oil (1 to 10), antisejotic gauze, composed of a coarse gauze impregnated with ' a solution of carbolic acid in parafiin and resin, and a protective consisting of oiled silk coated with copal varnish, and covered with a thin layer of a mixtm-c of dextrine and starch. The object of these various materials is as follows. The ivatery solution is used wLen the action required is not of long dui’ation, but wiien a vapour of carbolic acid is intended to be kept up round an open wound, the watery solution A'ery readily parting with its carbolic acid. It may be used in tw'o w^ays, either as a spray blowm upon the part from an ether-spray apparatus, or by means of a piece of linen rag soaked in the lotion and laid over the open wound while the more permanent dressings are being- prepared. The oily solution retains its carbolic acid much more firmly, and may be used w-here the action is required to be more prolonged, as in the fr-esh opening of an abscess Avhere the rush of pus might wash the watery solution out ol the piece of rag placed over the w-ound.

Its action is exactly the same as that of carded oakum, but it is more cleanly, more easily applied, and more certain in its action. The protective is a substance impenneable to carbolic acid, intended to be placed over a granulating wound in order to prevent, as far as possible, the direct contact of the carbolic acid, which, acting as a powerful iiTitant, would an-est or at least delay healing, and cause profuse suppuration, it IS used over granulating sores left after opening abscesses, &c., when it is thought desirable that they should heal. It is soaked in carbolic acid and water (1 to 40) before it is applied, so as to destroy any germs that may be resting upon fr ,- and after appheation, the small proportion of carbolic acid on Its surface being rapidly absorbed by the sore beneath, it is left almost perfectly fr’ee fr’om any imtating qualities. The opening of an abscess according to the antiseptic method is, therefore, done as follows. The skin all round for at least nine inches being well washed udth the watery solution, a spray of the same solution is blovm upon the part where the incision is to be made, and the abscess is opened with a knife which has also been dipped in the watery solution. The pus in the abscess being squeezed out, a plug of lint soaked in the oily solution or a piece of the gauze soaked in either the watery or the oily solution, is pushed into the opening so as to act as a drain, and allow the escape of the serous discharge, for the first few days ; or an India-rubber drainage-tube, soaked in carbolic acid, may be used as before described in the ordinary treatment of abscesses. The part is then wvapped in the gauze, folded eight layers thick and extending six or eight inches or more, accordiirg to the amount of discharge, on each side of the opening ; the spray must be kept up imtil the whole part is enveloped in the gauze. Over this dressing must be put a jnece of gutta-percha tissue, or of thin macintosh cloth dipped i:i carbolic acid and water, so that the discharge may not soak thi’ough at one spot and decompose, but may be evenly diffused over the whole of the di’essing. Over this water-proof material a bandage composed of the antiseptic gauze may be placed, and over all a common bandage if it be thought necessary. If the spray-apparatus be not at hand, or if there be no assistant to work it, the same objects may be obtained by the judicious use of a piece of rag soaked in the oily solution. It must be held over the part where the opening is being' made, and dropped on immediately it is completed, and the pus squeezed out fr’om underneath it. The dressing can then be put on over it, a corner of it being left exposed by which it can be chwvn out as soon as the gauze is finnly over the opening. Diming the after-dressings it is hardly necessary to use a rag soaked in the oily solution, imless the discharge be very profuse ; for, as the time occupied is veiy short, a piece of linen soaked in the ivatery solution will answer all the pm-poses required. It must be put over the whole part where the incision is, and the dressing removed from under it without exposing the wound to the air at all. If it be desirable to look at the opening, the rag may be raised while a small stream of carbolic acid and water is run over the wound by means of a syringe, an Esmarch’s irrigator, or a sponge. The dressings should be repeated on the day after the opening of the abscess, and, after that, CA'cry alternate day, or CA'cry third or fourth day, according to the amount of discharge.limiOmUlAGE INTO ABSCESSES. 157 Ifc is not to be imagined that in all cases this mode of treatment will entirely prevent the formation of pus after the opening of an abscess, as, although tension may be removed and decomposition may be prevented, other causes of irritation may be present; but, in all cases, the constitutional disturbance will be gi’eatly diminished by the prevention of the irritation necessarily resulting from the presence of fetid discharges in the cavity of the abscess and about the woiuid. If the discharge do not escape freely a common India-rubber drainage tube may be inserted, after being soaked for 24 hoiu’s in a concentrated watery solution of carbolic acid. If, as occurs in rare cases, decomposition has occuiTed in the abscess before it is opened, it may be corrected by injecting the sac of the abscess with some antiseptic agent, and for this piu’pose forty grains of chloride of zinc to one ounce of w^ater will usually be found the most effectual. Of the great value of this method of treatment, more esj)eciaUy in the case of chronic and cold abscess, there can be no doubt in the mind of any one w’ho has given it a fair trial. By the “ Antiseptic Method,” properly carried out, and in accordance with a scrupulous attention, to those details that are necessary for its successful employment, it will be found that the formation of pns speedily diminishes, that the danger of its decomposition is removed, and that the chance of constitutional initation is conseqirently greatly lessened if it be not entirely removed—that those dangers, in fact, wfrich are apt to result from the opening up of large suppinating cavities are greatly obviated by the use of antiseptic dressings. Constitutional Treatment.—With the \dew' of preventing the occinrence of suppuration, w^e must be carefrd to maintain the pow'ers of the system, and not to reduce the patient too much, even if the inflammation be of a sthenic character at the outset. Suppuration is a condition of debility, and is especially predisposed to by any previously existing enfeebled state of the system, or by malnutrition. Another reason for the avoidance of the early employment of debilitating means is that, if suppm-ation once be established, the drain on the system may e^-entually be so considerable as to require all the patient’s powers to enable him to bear up against it. Hence they should be husbanded from the hrst. After the discharge has taken place, noinishing, tonic, and even stimiflating treatment will be required in proportion to the amount of debility a IS in uce . Amongst the most useful medicinal agents are mineral and vegetable tomes, the mineral acids, and cod-liver oil in the more chi-onic . stages. Attention to hygienic conditions, with change of air, and residence at e sea-side, arc also valuable. When hectic comes on, the same general tonic plan must be adopted, while w'e have recourse to means adapted to meet the oca sjmp oms. us, acids are required to check the sw'eating, astringents 0 arrest the dianfroea, and as much mild nourishment as the patient will bear to support the strength.

IMorc conmionly it occiu’s after the opening of the abscess, in conse- quence probably of the Avail having lost the support of the contained pns, Avhen; the delicate vessels in the soft j)lastic and v'eiy vascular hbiing give way, and the cavity speedily fills VAoth blood. In these cases the htemorrhage may always- be aiTestcd by laying the cavity of the abscess freely open, timiing ont the- coagida, stuffing it with strips of lint, and applying pressure with a bandage. It nsnally, however, ceases of itself as soon as the cavity has been freely opened np and the interior exposed to cold air. HmmoiThage from Ulceration extending Mo a neiglibouring Vein, is neces- sarily far more serious. It has nsnally happened fi’om slonghy abscesses fomed on the side of the neck or under the angle of the jaw, as a consequence of scarlatina in strimions and imhealthy individuals, opening np the inteinal jngnlar vein. But it may arise, independently of any specific inflammation, in cachectic patients. In these distressing cases, the only treatment that can be adopted is, to ping the cavity of the abscess VAith hnt soaked in a solntion of the perchloride of iron, and supported by bandage or plasters. In this way the fatal event may be for a time perhaps delayed ; bnt it is inevitable ulti- mately, the blood bnrsting forth by the sides of the pings as these become loosened, or as the slonghing action opens np the vein more widely. The effect of the bleeding is greatly aggi-avated by the depressed state of the system, laboining under the coirjoined influences of a large infiltrated and slonghy wonnd and a specific poison. If the hmmon’hage arise from the Ulceration of a large Artery, the case necessarily becomes one of extreme nrgency. I have known this condition to occur in the neck and in the thigh; in the neck fi'om slonghy scarlatinal abscess implicating the carotid ; in the thigh, fi-om the extension of nlcerative action fi'om abscess and sinnses to the deep femoral. When this imtoward complication of abscess occiu-s in the neck, the hcemoiThage is nsnally so sudden and so profuse that the Surgeon has not time to tie the carotid before fife is extinguished. In the thigh the case is not so urgent. Warnings by repeated small htemorrhages may have enabled the Siu’geon to adopt means to- restrain the bleeding; and, in the case to which I allude, that of a young man, the femoral artery was tied successfully. In these cases, it is worse than useless to trust to secondary means for the arrest of the bleeding. When practicable, the artery should be compressed, the cavdty freely opened np, and the bleeding- vessel sought for and tied. If it cannot be found, the main trunk must be lio-atm-ed • and for obvious reasons this is the only course that can be pursued' in the neck. Sinus and Fistuta.—After an abscess has been opened, its cavity may not fill up completely, but, contracting into a narrow suppm-ating track, may form- a canal without disposition to close, and fr-om which a small quantity of pus- constantly exudes, thus constituting a Sinus or Fistula. The Cemses of this non-closure of the cyst of an abscess may be referred to- the following heads 1. The presence of a foreign body, as a piece of^dead bone at the bottom ; 2. The passage of irritating secretions,^ as urine, fa3ccs, saliva, &c., through the abscess ; and 3. The contraction of neighbouring muscles ; as when the abscess is in the neighbourhood of the sphincter ani, and as occasion- ally happens in abscesses about tlic limbs.159' snvus jUYJ) fistula. The difference between a sinns and a fistnla is this—that in the sinus there is only one external openint?, in the fistnla two or more. The track of a sinus is closed at one end, that of a fistula open at both. The orifice of a sinus or a fistula when situated in hard and condensed tissues, is often very small, depressed, and perhaps covered by a scab. In soft tissues it is conmionly large and widely open ; when conmumicating with bones there are usually soft florid gi'anulations obstructing it. Strudure.—A sinus or fistula consists of a naiTow channel, often long and ending, ha’S’ing an external orifice usually somewhat protuberant, and situated under or among loose florid gi-anulatious. The walls of this channel, which arc- always indimated, are lined by a low form of connective tissue resembling mucous membrane ; this, however, it is not, but simply consists of a layer of imperfectly foimed gi’anidations, exuding ichorous pus. If the orifice be- occluded, this pus will collect vnthin the sinus, and, distending its walls, recon- vert it into an abscess. In structure, therefore, a sinus or fistula may be said to be a long, naiTow, chronic abscess, with a permanent external aperture. The Treatment of a sinus or fistula has reference to its cause in the first instance; for, luitil the foreign body that keeps it open and maintains the- discharge has been removed, it will be useless to attempt its closure. After the removal of the obstacle to healing, we may endeavoim to procime obliteration of the sinus by one of three methods. 1. Pressure, by means of a roUer and gTaduated compress, so as to cause an agglutination of its opposite sides, is useful in those cases in which the sinus is. recent, without much suiTounding indination, and so situated, as upon the trunk, that pressure can easily be apphed. 2. A more healthy inflammation may often usefidly be excited in the sinus by iniedmj it from time to time with “red wash” or with tinctine of iodin7 by passing the thrcads of a seton or a drainage-tube thi'ough it, or by stimu- lating it by the occasional contact of a red-hot iron. This cjcdvanic cautery may often be employed with much success in the treatment of fistidm and sinuses to which other methods are not veiy aiiplicable. ’ 3. The last method consists in laymg open the sinus from end to end and then dressnig the wound so that it may heal fr-om the bottom; in this’way neighbouring muscles that have kept it open by their contractions, may also- be set at rest. The division of the sinus should be made with a probe-pointed ..stoury, introduced thicugh the external opening either by the aid of a Lector- 1 without such assistance. The operation should be done effectually, the sinus being usually follow^ed as far as is prudent, and laid completely open. , fistula maybe successfully and almost painlessly opened up by the slow-- acta, „ the „f valcanU I„dia!nKta lawn thiough and tied tightly, ulcerates in a few days through the soft mrf ^cvmg the track o the fistula. This plan is useful iif cases in^vhidl hml rhage IS apprehended or the patient dreads the knife.160 ULCERATION. CHAPTER VI. ■—i— * ULCERATION. I Ulceration is that process by which a solution of continuity wth loss of •substance, attended ndth the secretion of ichorous pus, is produced by molecular death of the superficial tissues. It may be the result either of some influence acting in the part itself, or of the destruction of the part by the sudden appli- cation of chemical agents. Two distinct stages attended by the most opposite . phenomena are described as constituting the process of ulceration ; viz., 1, the period of Destruction; 2, the period of Rejjair. To the first only can the term ulceration be properly applied, the stage of repair being one of deposition. The term ulceration is applied to the destruction of superficial tissues; although . the process may be regarded as having a close analogy nith the destruction of tissue which attends suppination within the textm-e or substance of parts. It is most common on the cutaneous and mucous surfaces, but occins likewise on the lining membrane of blood-vessels and on serous membranes. Ulceration is so intimately allied with sloughing and gangrene, that it is very difficult to separate its causes from those of these other conditions. Causes.—The Predisposing Causes of ulceration are chiefly found in those conditions that interfere in any way vith the nutrition of a part. A feeble circulation, such as often exists in the lower limbs, in the alae of the nose, and in newly formed or recently cicatrised tissues, predisposes to the formation of ulcers. As age advances, nutrition becomes impaired and the circulation less active, and slight causes suffice to disintegrate the structiue of a part; and mahiutrition, or loss of imiervation from any cause, by lessening the vitality and the resisting power of tissues, increases the tendency to ulceration. Hence we commonly see ulcers of the legs in elderly people, more particularly amongst the poorer classes, arising from slight in’itation or pressure. In the dogs that Magendie starved by feeding them on sugar, gum, or oil and distilled water, ulceration of the cornea occurred. This must have been the result of simple malnutrition, rather than of inflammation. ^ 1 Tissues that have been congested for a long time are apt to inflame under the influence of some trifling excitmg cause, and to run rapidly into ulceration. This usually commences in the centre of the part, where the nutrient action is lowest; here a small sore fonns, which exudes thin unhealthy pus, and rapidly extends. So long as the sore is inflamed, it continues to spread, and lepaiatioii cannot take place. It would appear as if even a moderate degree ot inflamma- tion were too intense for the vitality of chronically congested tissues, 01 of those in which lowly organised fibrine has been effused. Ihe more the Aitality of a tissue is reduced, the less appears to be the degree of inflammation that isCAUSES OF ULQERATTON. i6r required to ])roducc its clisintegTation and ulceration. Indeed, if the vitality of a part be sufficiently lowered, it may tall into a state of ulceration vuthout tfio occun-ence of inflammation, or ^vith so slight a degree as to be scarcely appre- ciable: the ulcerative action appearing to arise from disintegTation dependent upon the want of nutrition. Thus, for instance, in scrofula and other diseases in which there is an imperfect nutritive force, as in scurvy or syphilis, a tendency to softening and breaking down of structure, and consequent ulceration, exists ; und this tendency is much increased by the occiuTence of congestive or subacute inflammation. Exciting Causes.—Ulceration may be directly excited in several distinct ways on the cutaneous and the mucous siuffiices. 1. There may be such a degree of aouU local inflavimalion as rapidly to produce molecular death of the part. If the action be not very acute, and the destruction of the tissues not very rapid or extensive, the disorganised matters become mixed with pus, and are discharged in the form of a dirty, brownish, puriform fluid. If the action be more violent than this, complete disintegra- tion may not take place in the affected part, but shreds of the spoilt tisSies continue attached for some time to the ulcerated surface, and give it a very ragged appeai-ance. If the inflammation be more intense, layers of disorgam'sed tissue, constituting “sloughs,” are formed, and remain in contact udth the ulcerated surface, often covering it completely, and extending with considerable raindity into the neighboming healthy structures. In this manner sbme of the foms of phagedenic or sloughing ulcer are formed. 2. Chronic inflammation is perhaps the most common cause of ulceration ihe process of formation of an idcer under this condition has been well described by Billroth. “Let us suppose,” he says, “that we have a chronic inflammation ■ot the skin of the leg, say on the anterior surface of its lower thfr-d.

A vesicle or pustule forming on the cutaneous surface, and shedding its contents, very commonly gives rise to an ulcer, as in rupia and pemphigus. 5. Suppurative inflammation not unfrequently occurs in the subcutaneous or submucous areolar tissues, and, by undermining and consequently destroying the- vascularity of the skin and mucous membrane, and thus arresting its nutrition,, gives rise to ulcer. G. Ulceration may be produced by a severe mechamcal injury, by long con- tinued pressiu’e, or by the action of an irritant, prodircing a direct breach of surface. 7. In some specific cases, ulcei’ation is preceded by the fonnation of a morbid growth, tubercle, or tumour, in which infiammation and disintegration of tissue^. and consequent lesion of substance, occur. Situation.—Ulcers may be situated upon any part of the cutaneous sm’face- as the result of Aioleuce ; most conuuonly, when arising from some specific affection, they occur in particular situations, as on the penis, lips, tongue, &c.;; but when they occiu from disease of non-specific character they are usually seated on the leg. The lower half of the leg is the common seat of these sunple ulcers, which occur there in every possible variety. They are most common at or after the middle period of life, and are more frequently met with in the- poorer classes. They are especially predisposed to by all those circumstances that favom weakness of circulation, and consequently low vitafity of the part— as exposure to cold and Avet, Avant of food, &c. The skin of the loAver part of the leg is prone to these ulcerations, in consequence of its natural thinness, the feebleness of its circulation, more especially in advanced life, and its habihty to venous congestions from position. Ulcers that once foim here are slow in heahng and very liable to reem, because the conditions that led to their foi-mation may stiU exist, and there is often an absence of a proper subcutaneous areolo-adipose bed, with the consequent tendency to adhesion of the under sm’face of the ulcer to the aponeurosis or periosteum. Stages.—In Avhatever Avay ulceration commences, it presents thi’ee distinct stages : viz. 1, Extension or Slough ; 2, Arrest Avith Deposit of Plastic Matter;. and 3 Repair ly Granulation and Cicatrisation. 1 When the nicer is Spreading, there is alAA^ays a circle of inflammation aroimd it, as evinced by redness, heat, and a burning, thi’obbmg pain; its edo-es are jagged, eroded, or sharp cut and imdermmed its surface, which is more or less circular or oval, spreads nearly eqiiaUy from one starting-pomt, and is covered AAdth a greyish or yellowish, soft, adherent slough _ In ordinary cases this is thin and shi’eddy, but in some foi-ms of iilcemtion it ceous and elevated above the siuTOimding parts. There is eithei no discha at all,’ or only a bloody, ill-conditioned fluid, hardly desemiig the name of pus, that drains from the surface. 2. In the next stage, that of Arrest, the symptoms ot mflammatioii. and a layer of plastic matter is deposited in the tissues forming the base and sides 0/tho ideer. This not only serves to arrest or limit Hie hu-ther piores of ulceration, but becomes the medinni of ultimate to clean, the grey adherent slough separating iii ftnguientsnnddissolvin ill tho discharge, ivhich gi-adiially loses its sanions tmge, ™ ^ character of healthy pus, though still very seaiity. The smlace163 GRANULATIOK. fliittened, its sensibility diminishes, and the edges are often elevated, and in- durated. In this stationary condition an nicer may remain for many months ; and it is that in Avhich we commonly find chronic sores. 3. The last stage, that of Repair, is characterised by the formation of granu- lations, Avhich may bo looked ni^on as the tm-ning iDoint in ulceration. Until gi-anulations are formed, ulceration is a wasting process, or at most stationary • so soon as they are formed, repair commences. Instead of a tendency to extension and erosion, and to concavity, we now find a disposition to con- traction and deposition, and to convexity of the surface, which assumes a bright red hue, of a veimilion or scarlet tinge, and appears to be studded vith minute papilhn : the edges become rounded and smoothed dovm tow'ards the surfiice, losing their shai-p cut appearance ; and the discharge assumes the characters of healthy pus. Repair op Ulcers.—We now proceed to study the changes that occur in an ulcer dining the stage of repair—the processes of Granulation and of Okatrisaiion. Granulation. So soon as inflammation and extension of ulceration are checked, the siuface of the ulcer, as has already been stated, becomes covered by a layer of plastic matter. This plastic layer, separating the ulcer from smaoimding and adjacent tissues, forms a basis from which the gTanulations, the organs of repair, spring up. Before this plastic basis can be deposited, it IS necessaiy that the inflammation be reduced within those hmits that are compatible with plastic effiision. So long as inflammatory action exceeds his limit around the edge or at the base of the idcer, no lymph is efiiised. lit as soon as this undue action is checked, lymph, which becomes vascu- toised by vessels shooting into it from beloiv, is thrown out, and assumes a granulai form from the formation of papiBaj, or gi-amilations, which are com- posed of exudative matter that has become vascularised. In the great majonty of oases, giannlations are fonned only on surfaces exposed to the air fo.l.r ”f “V ''rfftout exposure to the air or the taX e tbfoT’ T’ ‘0 “ses of beeome vo. f granulations are m reahty composed of lymph that has wwX eX fact obseiwed by Hmiter, and ln„d, „!7- Ti'-W. both in wounds and in compound ft-actures, namely, that a portion of bii ish-white semitmnsparent Ijmiph eflhsed on the simfiie of the L or deniS bme s withoot^TTi^^'i!'^'^!shows that gi-aniilations are composed of cells heaped ut> substance.

The development of vessels in granulations—a most wonderful and beautiful process, by wbicb thousands of vessels may form in a day on a healthy gi-anu- lating surface—is identical -with their general development in lymph, which will be described in Chapter VII. ; a series of loops and arches being formed as outgrowths from neighboming vessels. The sensibility of gi-amdations varies considerably, being often greatest in those which spring from tissues that are naturally the least sensitive, as bone for instance. No nerves have been traced in granulations ; hence their appa- rent sensibihty would appear to depend upon that of the subjacent inflamed tissues. The cluiraders of granidations afford important indications to the Surgeon as to the condition of the surface from which they spring, and the state of the patient’s general health. Glranulations indicative of a healthy local and con- stitutional condition are small, florid, pointed, closely set, and bathed with healthy pus ; the use of Avhich appears to be to cover and protect the tender siu’face vdth a soft lubricant coating, into which the granulations may sprout Avithout being dried by the air, or readily damaged in any other way. In a weak state of the sore, or of the constitution, the secretion of pus diminishes, and it loses its healthy character ; the granidations become large, pale, and flabby, appearing to be oedematous fr-om infiltration of serum, and asstuning a glassy or semitransparent look, with a piu-phsh hue. Occasionally harmoirhage takes place into them, and they become bi oken dov n and sloughy. If, whilst a sore is healthily granulating, morbid action be set up in it, or in the economy—as by the supervention of erysipelas or fever the granulations degenerate at once, and become rapidly absorbed, the sm-face of the sore assuming a greyish, sloughy look, and the formation of pus being arrested. The Healing Process, or Cicatrisation, is that by which the ulcer closes and becomes covered by an integmnental investment. Two distinct processes, thouo-h carried on simidtaneously, are necessary for the accomphshment ot this.^ These are, that the granidations assume a healthy character, and cover themselves with new cuticle ; and that the sm-face of the sore contracts. The first change that takes place in an idcer that is about to undergo the heahno- process, is that the granulations become florid, and are bathed with healthv pus • the edges and surface of the sore then assume the same level- the gmmUafene lismg, and the edges subsiding. So long as there ,s any inequahty in this respect, the process of cicatrisation cannot go on. The granulations nearest the edges become smooth, oea® to pom- out tlazed over with a thin, whitish-blue pellicle—which is the ilist appeaiance ot Sew cuticle-composed of graniilation-ceUs developing^ trisation advances, the part of the sore mnncdiately inside this line will be seen to be occupied by a red cone, which, m the course of fom-a 1- twenty houi-s, becomes, in its tirni, new epidermis, and appeai-s to be the Imh between granulation and true cuticle. At tesame time that these changes are going on, contraction of the sore takis place. This would appear to be entirely a mecbanical process, and not reaction 1 it is owing'to the conversion of the eviidation-cclls of theCICATRISATION. 165 jiTaiiulatiohs into the filaments of cicatricial tissue, which, being more closely packed and becoming di-ier, occupy less sjjace (Paget). This contraction com- mences as soon as the sore presents a tendency to cicatrise, and continues for a considerable time after this is completed. Cicatrisation advances with greatest rapidity around the edges of the sore, the centre taking the longest time to heal, in consequence of the activity of the process appearing to diminish the farther the new epidermis extends from the old tissues. Indeed, if the ulcer be large, there may not be sufficient force for the cicatrisation of its centre. A sore of a circular shape usually takes a longer time to heal than an oval or elongated one. The new cuticle is formed at the edge only, and never primarily in the centre of an ulcer, unless islands of old skin be left there undestroyed, to serve as centres of cicatrisation. It would appear to be necessary for the healing process, that granulations have some of the old textm-es to be modelled upon, fr-om the j)lastic force of which there is an impulse given that causes their dev^elopmeut into analogous structure. It is in this way that the islets of skin implanted 011 a granulating surface by “ skiu-gTafting ” act beneficially as new centres of cicatrisation. The changes taking place in a cicatrix do not cease v^dth its formation. Two jn-ocesses continue for a very considerable length of time afterwards : viz., the gi-adual contraction and the development of the cicatricial tissue. ■\Te have seen that gi’anulations tend to contract diu-ing the healing of an ulcer, and that the diminution in surface thus produced facilitates gi’eatly its cicatrisation.^ Hence a scar is never so large as the original sore. This con- traction continues, however, and does not attain its maximum until long after the completion of cicatrisation, often occasioning great puckering or deformity. The degTee of contraction depends partly on the seat of the scar, but princi- pally on the natiu-e of the agent that produced the ulcer ; if the scar be seated on a part where the skin is very tense, the contraction wiU be slight; if the skin be naturally loose, it will be considerable. The contraction that takes place in scars vvhich result from burns is greater than that in those which occur from any other cause, often producing serious deformity and gxeat distress to the patient These results do not supervene in their fuUest extent imtil after a apse of some weeks or months fr-om the infliction of the injury This con- traction would iqipear in some cases to be due, not only to the consolidation of the^texture of the scar, but to its gi-eat size. ,Further changes are wought by time in the textm-c of a cicatrix.

Under the influence of scurvy or sy]Dhilis, an old scar is apt to open up again ; so also, if a fi’csh ulcer be fomred on the old cicatrix, it will take a longer time to heal than the original one. In structure, cicatrices are composed of a fibro-cellular tissue, rather spar- ingly supplied with blood-vessels, and covered by a thin epidermic covering, usually smooth and glistening, but sometimes nodulated and rugose. The sensibilitij of the cicatrix itself is lower than that of the skin generally, but the edges of the integument, Avhere in contact wth the cicatrix, are usually more sensitive than are the integuments on other parts of the body. When tough and irregular cicatricial bands, or “ ’bridles,” stretch across a part, it will usually be found that they are devoid of sensibihty. Diagnosis.—This is readily made when ulcers are seated on the skin, where no art is required to recognise a sore. On the mucous surfaces, however, it is not always easy to do so ; enlarged follicles and crypts, or aphthie, being constantly confounded vdth ulcers. The difficulty here proceeds from the circumstance that muco-pus may be poined out from a simply inflamed siu’face, or from one in which the abraded epitheliiun and open crypts are mistaken for ulcers. Treatment.—In the Local Treatment of ulceration, the Siu’geon must be guided by the special conditions presented by the ulcer, which will be described presently. But there are some points which demand attention in all cases. 1. Inflammation, when present, must be subdued ; until this be done, no proper reparative action can go on. 2. Congestion and determination of blood must be prevented, by keeping the part at rest, and in such a position as vdU allow the ready return of blood fr’om it. 3. Proper local applications adapted to the nature of the case, of an emollient, sedative, astringent, or stimulating character, must be employed fr-equently, conjoined vdth pressure upon, or support to, the weakened vessels of the part. Transplantation of Cuticle.—It has long been known to Physiologists and to Surgeons, that portions of the tegumentary structures, when completely detached and transplanted to other parts of the surface of the body, occa- sionally retain their vitality, and grow on the siuface on which they had been inserted. . i ^ . i The experiments of John Hunter on the transplantation of teeth, ot the cock’s spur, the experiments of Abernethy on the same subject, the adherence and continued groAvth. of a fr-eshly separated portion of the nose or chin, the transplantation, by Biienger, of a piece of the skin of the thigh on to tlic face for the formation of a new nose, and the observations of A alther that the button of bone removed by a trephine, if re-inserted, will contract adhesions ao-ain—all prove the fact that freshly separated parts, if immediately rc-applied to a raw surface, may contract adhesions to it. But it was reseiwcd tor lle- ^•ordin to show that cuticle, if transplanted, might be employed as an agent m the cicatrisation of granulating surfaces. This observation is as interesting m its scientific aspect, as it is full of promise in its application to p as ic siiigei}, nid has ah-eady been found in many instances to be of the greatest value in facilitating the cicatrisation of large ulcerated surfaces, which could not beTRANSPLANTATION OF CUTICLE. 167 covered bj skin in any other -vvay. It has already been explained that the process of cicatrisation of an ulcer always takes place from and through the medimn of pro-existent epidermis ; and further, that the formative force neces- sary for the extension of the cicatrix from the edge gradually becomes weakened, and at last entirely ceases. In such cases, especially when resulting fr’om bimis, haps of skin have occasionally been transplanted. But Reverdin has found ■that this is not necessary, and that all that is required is to idant small islets of fr-eshly separated cuticle on the granulating surface. These adhere where •transplanted, and each islet forms the centre of a neAV process of cicatrisation, which, spreading from its edge, and coalescing with that moulded by the sur- ivounding skin, and by the neighbouring islets of transplantation, soon covers the gramdating siu’face Awth a healthy cuticular cicatrix. The process of cuticular transplantation is as follows. A piece of skin on some sound part of the body—the outside of the arm, for instance—about the size of an oat or a split pea, is pinched up -with a pair of forceps, and snipped off with curved scissors. The whole thickness of the skin need not be sepa- rated, but merely the cuticle down to and including the papillary layer of the •true skin, so as just to show blood. The operation, when properly performed, is almost paiidess. The little patch of separated skin is now jdaced, nuth the raw side do^vnwards, on the surface of the ulcer, covered and retained in position by a strip of isinglass jdaster. It is left undisturbed for about foiu* days, at the end of which time it will be found to be adherent, and speedily becomes the centre of a new process of cicatricial action, which spreads in a gradually vddening circle, until it fuses itself into the cicatricial deposit that is in process of formation from the circumference of the sore, or fr’om other transplanted islets, and thus the cicatrix is rapidly formed. For the success of this little operation, it is necessary that the granulating smface on to which the transplantation is made, be a healthy one ; that it be not the seat of specific disease of any kind, or the result of such disease ; and that the process of cicatrisation have commenced at its edges. The piece of transplanted skin shoidd be tenderly handled, and at once applied and retained by moderate pressure. In placing it in its new position, it is well that the granulations be not bruised, so as to be made to bleed, which would be fatal to the success of the experiment. It is better to apply several small grafts of skin than one large one each new graft acting as a centre of cicatrisation, nnd the process going on more rapidly fr-om several small centres than fr’om one large one. There is one point of importance in respect to the transplanta- tion of cuticle, viz., that the cicatrisation resulthig is often weak, and the cicatiix is apt to break down much more readily than one that has not been produced by grafting. he Constitutional Treatment must be carefully attended to. Unless this le {orie, the best regulated local plan may be employed in vain.

IV iieu ulcers occur in the sldu, as the result of nou-specific disease, they may be arranged under the following heads : the Healthy ; the Weak ; the Indolent; the Imtable ; the Inflamed ; the Phagedeenic or Sloughing ; the Varicose ; and the HasmoiThagic. Besides these varieties, each of Avhich is marked by distinct characteristics, various other fomis of ulceration depending on specific causes, as the Syphilitic, Scrofulous, Liipoid, Cancerous, &c., are- met with ; all of which will be treated under their respective Chapters. The varieties presented by ulcers are by no means dependent on local con- ditions merely, though these infiuence them gveatly, but are in a great measiue owing to constitutional causes. Indeed, the aspect of the ulcer, and the character of its granulations and of its discharge, are excellent indications of the state of health and of the general condition of the patient, as well as of the local disease. Healthy or Purulent Ulcer.—This may be considered the type of the disease. It presents'a circular or oval smface, slightly depressed, thickly studded with small gTanulations exuding laudable pus, and having a natural tendency to contract and heal. It is the object of all our treatment to bring- the other fomis of ulcer into this condition. Troatment.—In the management of the healthy ulcer, the treatment should be as simple as possible ; ■water-dressing and the pressime of a bandage usually enabling it readily to cicatrise. Sometimes, however, as has already been stated, the healing process is retarded or aiwested in consequence of the extent of the idcer. In such cases, the transplantation of cuticle ■\\nll, by afibrding centres of cicatrisation, expedite ciue. According to Lister, the application of the antiseptic gauze and protective, in the maimer described m speaking of the treatment of abscess (p. 150), has also been found most efficacious in promoting the healing of ulcers of long duration. The strength of the solution of carbolic acid should be low (about 1 iii 40), so as to avoid undue initation. "Weak Ulcer not uncommonly occurs from emollient applications hai'ing'^ been continued for too long a time in the last vai’iety of the disease ; the granulations then becomhig high and fiabby, "with a semi-transparent appear- ance about them, and sometimes rising in large, exuberant, gelatinous, reddish- looking masses aboi'e the siu’face of the sore. These high granulations ha'^e a feeble -^fitality, and readily slough. The Treatment of this form of ulcer consists in keeping the part elevated and carefully bandaged, and applyuig an astringent dressing to the sore, such as the “ red wash,” or a Aveak solution of the sulphate ot copper or of zinc, according to the folloAAing formula ;—Sulphate of zinc, sixteen grains ; com- pound tincture of lavender and spirits of rosemary, of each tAVO drachms ; Avater, eight ounces. This Avill be foimd a most useful application ; and the granulations may be touched fi'om time to time AAith nitrate of sihci. Indolent or CaUous Ulcer.—This is ahvays veiy chronic. It is situated upon the outer side of the loAver extremity, between the ankle and calf, and most freauentlv occurs in men about the middle period of life. It is deep and UMU tin —oo'VARIETIES OF ULCER. 169, integument is congested, and matted to the subjacent parts ; there is usually v ery little subcutaneous areolar tissue about it, the skin being firmly fixed to the subjacent fascia ; and it Avould appear as if it were in consequence of this want of a vascular substratum from which to siting, that granulations do not readily arise. There is no pain attending this ulcer; and its surface, which often attains a very large size, may usually be touched without the patient feeling it. Treatment.—The principle of the treatment here is twofold ; to dejjress the edge, and to elevate the base of the sore. This is effected by pressure and stimulation conjoined. The old and very efficient plan of treatment that used to be adopted is as follows. The treatment should be conunenced by rubbing the siuface of the ulcer and the surroimding congested integument with nitrate of silver ; a linseed-meal poultice should then be ajDplied for twenty- four hoius, after which the sore should be properly strapped on the plan reconmiended by Baynton. The best plaster for this purpose is the emplas- tnmi sajwnis, to which some of the emplastrum resince is added to make it sufficiently adhesive ; this, spread upon calico, should be cut into strips sixteen or eighteen inches in length, and about an inch-and-a-half in width ,- the ccntie of the strip should then be laid smoothly on the side of the limb oj>po- site to the sore, and the ends, being brought forward, are to be crossed ob- liquely over it. Strip after strip must be applied in this way, until the limb is covered for a distance of a couple of inches above and below the ulcer. If the sore be near the ankle, this jomt shoidd be included in the strapping. Each strip of plaster should be applied with an equal degree of pressiue, Avhicffi may often be considerable, and it should cover at least one-third of the pre- ceding strap ; the limb must then be carefully bandaged fr-om the toes to the ^nee. Under this plan of treatment, the edges will subside, the smface of the sore voU become florid, and gTanulations yielding abundant discharge will speedily spring up. Much of the success of this plan of treatment will "depend upon the close attention that is paid to it. If the skin be iiritable, no resin- plaster shoidd be used, but merely the soap or lead ; and the plasters should be changed at least every forty-eight hoius. If the discharge be very abun- ant, small holes should be cut in the strips to aUow it to escape, men by this mode of treatment the edges of the sore have been brought down, and the gi-anulations sufficiently stimidated, an astringent lotion with bandaging may advantageously be substituted for the plasters. Another and more efficient method consists in—1. Painting the whole surface of the idcer and the neigh- honinng callous parts with ethereal solution of cantharides ; 2. Applying carbo- iscd water-dressing or oakuin-]ioultice for a few days; 3. men granulations nave spnuig up, transplanting a row of skin-grafts within the edge of the sole ; 4. Continuing antiseptic dressing and pressure with clastic bandao-es Irritable Ulcer is mostly met with in women about the middle period of ^or bilious temperament. It is usually of ™il S.7.C and aituatod abont the ankles, or upon the shin. Ito Xe U’ msa.ar, but not elevated, the surface is g.-oyish, covered with a Ih C*ULCERATION. I 70 In tlio Trcaimo.nt of this nicer, we must attend to the constitutional as well ns to the local condition. The patiejit should be put upon an alterative coui-sc ■of medicine, with aloetic piu’gatives, and some sedative at bedtime to procure rest. The mode of topical medication which I have found to succeed l)est, is to brush the surface of‘the sore and the siuTouiiding parts from time to time Avith a strong solution of nitrate of silver, and then to keep emollient and sedative applications applied to it, such as lead and opium lotions. The ■occasional application of the nitrate of silver deadens materially the morbid sensibility of the sore, and assists its gi’anulation. Inflamed Ulcer.—This is characterised by much redness, heat, and .swelling, of the siuTounding parts, accompanied by a thick and offensive dischai-ge, often streaked with blood ; it may arise from the over-stimulation of one of the other varieties. The Treatment must be locally and generally antiphlogistic. The elevated position, the appheation of leeches aroimd the sore, and of cold evaporating lotions to the siu’face of the limb, speedily subdue the iuflammatory action; .and the healing process then takes place noth great rapidity. Sloughing Ulcer.—When not specific, this is au increased degree of the inflamed variety, usually ocemving in a feeble or cachectic constitution, and generally accompanied by a good deal of in'itative fever. An angry dusky red blush forms about the sore, which becomes hot and painful; the siu’face .assumes a greyish sloughy look, the edges are sharp cut, and the ulcerati^e action extends rapidly. Treatment.—This should consist in improving the general health by lessen- ing irritation, and keeping up tone. The administration of opiates, with noiu’ishing but uustimulating diet, should be trusted to, at the same time that ■the local action is subdued by rest and warm opiate lotions. When the inflaru- matory condition has subsided, tonics should be given internally, and a grain or two of the sulphate of copper or zinc, or a little carbolic acid, may be added to the lotion with which the sore is dressed. The specific varieties of sloughing ulcer will be considered iii the Chapters ■on Hospital Gangrene, &c. _ ,• j .-.i "Varicose Ulcer derives its chief characteristic from being complicated w ith, ■or dependent upon, a varicose condition of the veins of the leg. In this ■affection of the venous trunks the skin gradually undergoes degeneration, becoming brawny, of a pmplish brown colour, and being traversed m all ■directions by enlarged and tortuous cutaneous veins. The ulcer forms at ■one of these congested spots, by the breaking down of the afready disorganised tind softened tissue, producing a small irregular chasm of an unhealthy appeai-- ance and varying much in character, being sometimes inflamed, at otheis irritable or sloughy, and then becoming indolent. One of the ^ <3ffects of this ulcer is that, by penetrating into one of ^ occasionally gives rise to very abundant hinmorrhage ; the pataent 111 he course of a few seconds losing a pint or two of blood This hieinoiT ag 1 my be readily arrested by laying the patient 011 his back, elevating the liml, compressing the bleeding point with a pledget of lint and a lollei.

This may be done by means of a well-applied bandage, made of elastic material, or a laced or clastic stocking applied to the leg, so as to keep up imifprm prcssiu-e upon the distended vessels. In some ■cases, the length of the column of blood may be broken by the application of ii vidcanised India-rubber band below the knee. In many cases, the cicatrisa- tion of the ulcer cannot be brought about in this way ; or, if the ulcer heal, it constantly breaks open again : or ha^moiThage may occur from a ruj)tured vein upon its surfece. Other means, which -will be described in a future •chapter, must then be taken for the permanent occlusion of the varicose vessels. As this procedine, however, is attended by some danger from the •occasional induction of phlebitis or erysipelas, it should not be had recoinse to unless the existence of one or other of the conditions just mentioned urgently •calls for it. Haemorrhagic Ulcer.—This is a dark piu-plish-looking sore, which occiu's in women suffering from amenorrhoea, and has a special tendency to ooze blood about the menstrual periods, whence its name. It usually partakes of the character of the im'table ulcer. Treatment. The htemoiThagic ulcer requires to be treated by constitu- tional means, having for their object the improvement of the patient’s general health ; with this view, the preparations of iron and of aloes are especially nsefid. Ulcers on IKCucous IVEembranes.—Various forms of ulcers occur upon the mucous membrane of the thi'oat, rectum, and genital organs. As these, how- ever, are commonly specific, they will be hereafter described. VTien ulcers of the mucous membrane are not of a specific character they present the general appearances characteristic of the cutaneous healthy, niflamed, or weak varieties, and require the topical applications which have been described as suited to these conditions ; though generally they will demand the free employment of caustics, especially of the nitrate of silver.THE PllOGESS OF REPAllL I?2 CHAPTEE YII. —♦— THE PROCESS OP REPAIR. Having, in the three preceding Chapters, described certain pathological conditions in which interference mth the normal nutrition of the part is a prominent featine, and having, m regard to one of these, indicated the means by which Natine repairs the injiuy, we have now to give a smnmaiy of the means by which injiuies in general are repaired. Singical operations generally necessitate the production of woimds, which differ in no essential respects fi’om the incised wounds to be described in Chapter IX. ; and the description of the various forms of the heahng process, to be now given, will be equally apphc- able to the effects of the Singeon’s knife and to the wounds arising from accident. A wound, or solution of continuity, may miite in one of the following fi-se ways :—l,by the direct gi’owiiig together of two opposed siu’faces—immediate union ; 2, by immediate miion imder a scab ; 3, by the union through the inedimn of coagulable lymph of the opposed siu’faces—luiion by primaiy adhesion ; 4, by the springing up from the bottom and sides of the wound of gi'anulations which eventually become covered with an epidermic layer ; and 5, by the gro\viug together of two granulating surfaces—secondary adhesion. The first thi’ee methods of repair are confined in their action to incised and punctiu’ed womids, the fii’st being special to clean incisions. The last two may occim in incised woimds, if either of the three preceding ones fail, and are the only means by vdiich contused and lacerated wounds, vith some rare exceptions, have been known to heal. 1. Immediate Union.—The direct growing together of opposite siufaces was termed by Hiuiter “ Union by the First Intention: ” but most modern Siu’geons extend the latter term to the union by adhesive uiflammation, or primary adhesion. Wounds that unite in this way do so by the simple and direct coalescence of the opposite surfaces ; and not, as Himter sup- posed, by the interposition of a layer of effused blood ; or, as others hai-e imao-ined, by lymph poimed out to form an ranting mediirai. Macartney pointed out the error of these doctrines, and showed that the process consists essentially in the accraate apposition of clean cut parts which mute and grow together directly in the corase of a few horas, without inflannnation or any of its products being requfred to effect the radon ; hence he termed it “immediate union. The Conditions neccssaiy for direct union are the following 1. A healthy constitution ; 2. The perfect coaptation of the cut srafaccs ; 3. The exclusion of air and foreign bodies from between the sides of the voirac , . i absence of all inflannnatory action ; and 5. A certain homogeneity o s uic rae.HEALING BY SCABBING. 173 As may readily be supposed, it is not often in sm-gical practice that such a simple and direct result can be obtained ; though, in- some of the plastic opera- tions about the fece, we succeed in securing it. It is especially in childipn and young people, in whom the constitution is pime and healthy, that this kind of union is to be obtained, and after operations for the cure of deformities. as hare-lip or cleft palate, rather than in those for the removal of disease. After some of the larger operations, in adults even, this kind of miion may exceptionally take place. Paget has recorded a case of amjmtation of the breast, in which the flaps contracted immediate and direct union with the sub- jacent parts ; and, on the patient dying of erysipelas at the end of three weeks, the imion was so perfect that it was impossible to discover by microscopic examination that any inflammation had existed, or exudation-matter had been pomed out. In some flap operations, the Sm-geon may succeed in seeming union by this means. Thus, in amputations of the thigh and arm, we occa- sionally find nearly the whole, or a considerable portion, of the flaps united together at the expiration of about eight-and-forty horns. Umiogeneity of Structure is of essential importance in seeming this kind of imion. It cannot take place, for instance, between a muscular flap and the cut end of a bone. But it takes place here between soft parts cori’esponding in structme ; and the more homogeneous these are, the more likely is direct union to ocem. Hence it is easier to seciue it in wounds of the face ; com- posed as this region is of integumental structiue, and ceUulo-adipose and muscular tissues, nearly uniformly blended. The advantages gained by this mode of imion are, absence of inflammatoiy action, conservation of the vital force, and immediate and permanent closm’e of the cavity of the ivound, all of which render the patient less liable to some of the after-consequences that attend the heahng of open woiuids. Fiuther, there is no development of cicatricial tissue, and consequently no danger of subsequent contraction and deformity. 2. Healing by Scabbing or Incrustation consists in the duect adhesion of the lower parts and sides of a wound under a crust of dried blood, scrum, hair, &c., which fonns an au-tight covering. The absence of inflammation is necessary for heahng by scabbing ; for, if any effusion occiu, the crust will be loosened, air will be admitted to the wound, and all chance of immediate union destroyed. Hence this kiiul of union is extremely rare in man, except in small and supei-ficial injuries, owing to the readiness with which inflammation is set up, but it is connnon in the lower animals. This natmul process is sometimes mutated by the Surgeon when he closes a small pmictured external wound, mich as that of a compound fractiue, ivith a piece of lint dipped in blood" CO odion, stjqrtic colloid, fiiars’ balsam, &c., under which union takes place. e essential point in obtaining union by scabbing is to secure the absence ^ air from the ivound, as well as of any foreign body that may give rise bv m-itation, to inflammatoiy action. ’ ^ Analogous to healing hjscahUiuj is the process of ciuc in subcutaneous w^ounds ^m dislocations, simple fi-actures, and other similar injuries, and also in the arious operations of tenotomy. In these cases repair takes place without anvin- amraation, even though this be excited, as it sometimes is, by theiniury • the para ivc material, “ nucleated blastema,” not being an inflammatory product174 THE PJiOCESS OF EE PAIR. 3. Union by Adhesive Inflammation, the “ Union hj the First Intention of modem feimgeons, or “ Priman/ Adhesion,” as it is teimed by Paget, is'. effected by the effusion of lymph between the opposed siu’faces, and is more frequently obtained than the direct union. In order that it should take place, the following conditions are necessary :—1. That the patient’s eonstitntion be in a healthy state ; 2. That the woimd be closed, its sides brought into accu- rate apposition, and the air excluded ; 3. That the interposition of all foreign bodies be carefully guarded against; 4. That the inflammation be restrained nithin such bounds as sirBice for the production of lymph, but are insufficient for the destruction and degeneration of the latter, or the production of | pus. The lymph, or matter effused, presents itself to the Siu-geon in two forms.. One is the true healthy coagulable lymph—the ^Acistic lymph of Wilhams, or- the fih-inoiis of Paget; it is this, by which union is effected. The other form has been named aplastic by WiUiams, croupous by Eokitansky, and corpuscular by Paget. This variety of lymph is met with in, and is indicative of, cachectic states of the system. It consists of a thin, clear, serous fluid, in which float coi-puscles, resembling in general characters the white coi-puscles of the blood. The corpuscles of this aplastic lymph are liable to degenerate into gi’amfle- cells, granidar matter, and debris. Indeed, this corpusciflar lymph is closely allied to pus. {Fee p. 140.) These two primary forms of lymph, the fibrinous and the corpuscular, are- ahnost always fomid together, but exist in various proportions in the same- exudation-mass ; the relative quantity of the one or the other element deter- mining whether it shall undergo development or degeneration. Paget observes that, “ the larger the proportion of fibrine in any specimen of inflammatory lymph (provided it be healthy fibrine), the greater is the likehhood of its being organised into tissue this preponderance of fibrine being indicative of adhesive inflammation. And “ the larger the proportion of corpuscles, the greater the probability of suppination or of some other generative process the preponderance of corpuscles being a general featine of suppinative inflammation. The foUnwing are the steps in the process of union by adhesive inflamma- tion in an ordinary incised wound. On the cessation of aU htemoiThage, the mouths of the dixdded A'essels and capillaries are clogged by red coi’pusclcs, whilst the hquor sanguinis is poured out over the denuded sinfaces. Thc'- fibrine coagiflates and, together with proportion of white corpuscles, adheres to the surfaces, leaving the serum to drain away. The sides of the woimd , having thus become “ glazed ” are approximated, while the layer of flbrine, being continually added to by fresh exudation, glues them together; the edges of the external incision become shghtly reddened, swollen, and tender; the ■ serum, stained somewhat by admixture with blood, continues to exude for some- hours. Meanwhile, permanent union takes place by the gradual organisa- tion of the layer of fibrine into connective tissue, and all signs of inflamma- f tion subside, as the external line of incision becomes gradually coieicd uitli epithehum. The adhesive layer forms with varying rapidity on different : surfaces ; thus in a stump, after amputation, it will be found that the muscles, fascite, and areolar tissue arc covered with fibrine in the course of a few houis I175 VASGULAl{Ii:iATION OF LYMPH. it is not until the third or fourth day that the subcutaneous fat becomes; coated in the same way; and eight or ten days elapse before the adhesi^'c lymph is thrown out upon the cut surface of the bone ; and here it shoAvs- itself firet on the medullaiy canal, afterwards on the cancellous textiu’O, and lastly upon the hard bone. For the production and organisation of this. lymj)h a certain amount of inflammation is a necessai-y condition, but, as before said, it must be confined Avithin proper limits ; an inflammation that is- too intense or too prolonged is fatal to the adhesh'e process. If too violent, the adhesive stage Avill be hun-ied into the suppurative ; whilst, if it be toO' long continued, the development of the lymph Avill be interfered AAuth ; for,, although inflammation is necessary for the foi-mation of the bond of union,, none is required for its organisation, or for its ultimate develoj)ment into fibro- areolar tissue. From what has been stated aboA'e, it is clear that no blood must be per- mitted to remain betAA’een the opposed surfaces Avhen brought into contact Avith a view to their adhesion ; it Avould simply act as an impediment to the coalescence of the fibrinous layers. Moreover, it Avdll eventually break doAAni, and disintegrate in the suppurative discharges excited by its presence ; hence in the dressing of siu'gical Avounds, such as stumps after amputation’ and in aU cases in Avhich it is advisable to attempt to procime union by adhesive inflammation, the ent surfaces should not be brought together for a few hoiu-s, imtil all oozing of blood has ceased and the fibrinous layer has been thrown out. Vascularisation of Lymph.-In lymph that undergoes development, blood- vessels are seen to make their appearance at an early period. With regard to the precise time of their formation, Dupuytren and Villerm4 state, from their experiments on dogs, that twenty-one days are required ; and Travers fr'om his ^penments on the frog’s web, fixed the same period as that in AA^hich red blood n 1"" Wver, the lymph on the surface of c ilcer 01 AAomid certainly ajipears to become vascular long before this.

I'hese loops give rise to secondary vascular outgxowths ; and thus the vascularisation of the lymph is completed. Travers states that these vessels are visible, like fine striae, before the circu- lation can be detected in them. A single blood-corpuscle fii'st enters ; this is folloAved by others, Avhich for some time hai'e a see-saw or oscillating motion, progressing gradually towards the nearest vessel, by the entrance of the blood into which the circulation is completed, and becomes contmuous and ecpiable. Degemraiion of Lymph.—This has been especially studied by Paget. He obsen'es that it may wither and harden, forming dry horny masses of vegeta- tions ; or that it may undergo fatty degeneration, and become converted into granular matter. These last two forms of degeneration are frequently met Avith in the coats of diseased arteries. Besides these changes, it may calcify, being- replaced by an inorganic earthy material; it may undergo pigmentary changes ; ■or it may be converted into pus. 4. Granulation.—In those cases in which, from the natiue and situation •of the wound, or in consequence of the broken state of the patient’s constitu- tion, or fi-om some local interference with the healing process, or from some other distiu-bing cause, union by direct cohesion, or by adhesive inflammation, fails to be accomplished, union by “ the Second Intention,” as it is termed, occurs ; and we may often see in the same Avound, one portion healed by direct union, another part by adhesive inflammation, and the remainder by granula- tion. In such instances, the layer of lymph effused over the sm-face of the Avomid increases luitil it is organised into a mass of thick and ruddy granula- tions, whilst the serous oozing, transparent and thin at first, becomes gi-adually thick and opaque, and Avill be found by the third or fourth day to have assumed the form of pus. The inflammation has passed therefore from the adhesive to the suppiu-ative stage. This transition is attended by a general febrile condition, the presence of Avhich is readily detected by the thermometer, AA^hich may indicate a rise of 2°, 3°, or even 6° Pahr. With the estabhshment of suppiu’ation, the pyrexia rapidly abates and disappears by the fifth or sixth day; any rise of temperatm-e subsequent to this date cannot be due to the natural process of repair, but denotes danger from some other quarter. In other respects, healing by granulation is identical with the process of the repair of ulcers ; and to that description (p. 163) the reader is referred. It must not be forgotten, howeA'er, that suppm-ation is by no means essential to repair by granulation. We shall find that, imder certain favourable conditions, the repair of extensive and severe wounds has been accomplished AAuth little or no formation of pus, the organisation of the lymph into fibro-cellular tissue being effected in a maimer somewhat similar to that Avhich obtains in sub- cutaneous injuries, such as simple fractiu-es. The class of injuries in Avhich Ave look for union by the second intention includes the contused and lacerated AA'Ounds of all kinds, the cavities left after removal of dead bone, the raw surfaces folloAAung burns and scalds, poisoned wounds, and those incised wounds Avhich, fr-om the state of the patients health, or fr-om too A'iolent or too prolonged inflammation, or fr-om the mtci-CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING REPAIR. 177 position of blood or other forcii^n body, or from access of air to the wound, have failed to heal by adhesive inflammation. f). Union by Secondary Adhesion.—It not nnfrequently happens that, although gTanulations spring up over the sides of a wound, union between the opposed siudaccs does not take place. We endeavour to accomplish this by bringing the granulating sides together and retaining them in that position, when they will cohere; this constitutes imion by‘‘/S'econffer//In some amputations, and in many plastic operations, cases of hare-lip, cleft- palate, &c., miion is occasionally brought about in this manner. On considering the Aa'c methods of union in wounds just described, it is at once evident that the Siu-geon’s best endeavours should be directed towards procuring healing by one of the fli’st three in preference to the last two, wherever iwacticable. The patient is not only spared the drain of a more or less jjrolonged suppm-ation, Adth its attendant Avaste of neAv tissue-elements, elaborated at the expense of his A’ital powers, but he is also saved from the subsequent dangers to life that must always be associated AAuth an open Avound. It has been remai-ked above, and is to be insisted on A'ery strongly, that access of air to the denuded tissues, or the presence of a foreign body between the lips of the wound, is equally fatal to direct union, to union by scabbing, and to union by adhesive inflammation. Circumstances aiFecting the Healing Process.—When any animal fluid, such as blood, sermn, pus, &c., is exposed to ordinary atmospheric an, a putre- factn e action is set up, with the production of various organic acids of acrid natme, quite cap»able, if alloAved to remain in contact AAuth a raAv sinface, of being as iiTitating as any extraneous body. This property was formerly con- sideied to be due to the action of atmospheric oxygen; but, according to Pastern, it arises from the presence in the atmosphere of minute organic particles, the genus of A'arious monads, bacteria, &c., the development of Ai ich in appiopiiate menstrua is attended Avith a catalytic or fennentatiA'e change in the chemical constitution of the fluid, rendering it not only locally irntatmg but constitutionally infective. Of the presence in the air of such floating organic matters in large quantities the observations of Tyndall and ai -es eave no doubt. Of their active agency in the production of decom- po^tion in putrescible fluids. Lister’s experiments furnish conclusiAn evidence. e c le point in the^ management of wounds being to obtain union AAuth ^ e minimum of suppuration, modem Singeons haA'e endeavoured to prcA’cnt or aimihilate the decomposifrou of the fluids of the part in one of two ways- ei ler y 0 a y excluding air from the Avound, or, by the use of chemical agents winch can act on the organic matters suspended in the air, to purify it and depriA e it of some of its catalytic poAver.

Habits of nitemperance and over-indulgence, privation, exposure, bad sanitary and hygienic conditions, are all alike antagonistic to reparative action.

SUKGICAL INJURIES. INJURIES AFFECTING THE TISSUES GENERALLY. CHAPTER YIII. Ajs injury, if at all sGvere, besides its local effects, is liable to be attended by certain constitutional effects, some of which appear immediately, others after vaiying intervals of time. Several of the diseased conditions which may supervene on injury, such as Gangrene, Erysipelas, Pytemia, Tetanus, &c., will be treated of hereafter. Inflammation and its results, Suppiu’atiou and Ulceration, have been aheady descnlied : and m this place we have to notice Shock, Traumatic Fever, Trau- matic Dehnum, and the Remote Effects of Iiiiiuw.

In rccoYcry followed a fall of tcmperatiu’c amounting to four degTCCS. fatal cases there may he a fall of as much as six degrees. These s}mptoms commonly set in immediately on the receipt of the injmy. In some cases, however, there is an appreciable interval of time between the infliction of the injury and the appearance of the shock ; this is more particularly the case in persons of great mental fortitude, or whose minds arc actively engaged at the moment of the receipt of an injury. This condition lasts for a variable period, its duration depending on the severity and seat of the injmy, on the nervous susceptibility of the patient, and on the state of his mind at the time. Causes.—Shock is partly due to partly to physical causes. Its severity and continuance are thus materially iirfluenced by the moral condition of the j)atient, and by the degi’ee and natme of his injmy. In persons of a very timid character, or of great nervous susceptibility—those who are hable to the occurrence of syncope—more especially in females and in childi’en, a very trmal injury may produce an extreme degree of shock to the neiwons system ; indeed, the mere apprehension of injmy may, vdthout the occiu’rence of any physical lesion, give rise to aU the phenomena of shock in its most intense degree. People have been actually frightened to death, Avithout any injmy having been inflicted upon them. The state of mind at the time of the receipt of the injmy, influences materially its effects on the neiu’ous system. If the patient be anxiously watching for the infliction of a Avound, as waiting for the first incision in a smgical operation, all the attention is concentrated upon the coming pain ; it is scA^erely felt, and the consequent shock to the system is unusually great. If, on the other hand, the attention be diverted—if, as in the horn* of battle, the feelmgs be roused to the highest pitch, and the mind in a state of intense excitement—a seA'ere injury may be infiicted, and the patient may be enthely unconscious of it, feeling no pain, and experiencing no shock, perhaps not knoAvdiig that he is AA"ounded till he sees his oa\ti blood. The severity of shock is ui a great measme piopoitiouate to the degree of pain attendant upon an injmy. And, as sensibihty to pain varies greatly in different individuals, so AAfill the attendant shock. Fmueaux Jordan has pointed out that the frmctional actiA'ity of the nerA Ous system has an important influence in the production of shock. In yomig children, he obseiwes, whose force is developmental rather than neiwons or muscular, operations and injmies are better borne than by men in the prime of life, Avhere all organs and functions are subservient to the exercise of neiwe-force. And the same ocems in persons worn by long-standing local disease, Avhich has lowered the manifestations of vitality without impairing the integrity of the organs essential to life. “Shock,” he says, “is essentiaUy a depression or metamorphosis of nerve-force. AVhere nerve-force is predominant, shock also becomes predominant.” 7 • > The sudden occmrence of a severe injmy AA'ill, however, induce a phiisical impression independently of any mental emotion or moral mfluenco. thus, 1 a limb of one of the lower animals, as of a frog, be suddenly crushed by tl c blow of a bammer, the force and frequency of the heart s action immediate 3 become considerably lessened. Here there can be no menta unpiession. ' " man, it is found that the severity and the continuance of the shock are usui } proportionate to the severity of the injury, cither from its extent or from thei8i TREATMENT OF SHOCK. importance of the part woimclccl. Tims, if the whole of a limb be tom away by a cannon-shot, or crushed by a railway-train, the shock will be severe from the extent of the mutilation, thongh the part injured be not immediately necessary to life ; whilst, on the other hand, if a man be shot by a pistol-bullet through the abdomen, though the extent of the injury be trifling, and merely a few drops of blood escape, yet the shock to the system Avill be severe, owing to the importance in the economy of the part injimed. The Siu’geon not un- ft-cquently employs this fact as an accessory means of diagnosis. Thus, if a man break his leg, and at the same time strike his abdomen, and the shock be very serious and long continued, without sign of rallying, the probabihty is that some severe injmy has been inflicted upon an internal organ ; injury of the viscera occasioning greater severity and longer continuance of shock than a wound of a less vital part. In extreme cases, the depression of power characterising shock may be so great as to teiminate in death. Jordan describes two kinds of death from syncope, as being produced by shock. In cases where the imp)ression is sudden and violent, the heart is contracted and empty, or nearly so. More frequently, however, there is a sudden arrest of the contractile power of the heart, and its cavities contain more or less partially coagulated blood. In the great majority of instances, however, reaction comes on, and the disturbed balance in the system is gradually restored, lilot unfr’equently the reaction runs beyond the limits necessary for this, and a febrile state is induced, the traumcitic fever, which udll be presently described. Pathological Appeaeancbs.—There are no absolutely characteristic mortem appearances after death fr’om shock. The heart is often found full of blood, especially the right auricle and ventricle, and the whole venous system is somewhat gorged, unless the jiatient has lost much blood from the accident. The blood was said by Hunter to remain fluid in some cases of death from shock, but this is certainly of very rare occurrence. Rigor mortis is usually well marked. Ireatheht. If the distm'bance be chiefly mental, the patient will usually rally speedily on being spoken to in a kind and cheering manner, or on having a little mne and water, or ammonia, administered. If the shock l)e moie severe, and be the result of considerable injiuy, the jiatient should be laid iu the recimibent position, and the injimed part aiTanged as com- lOTtably as possible ; he should be capped up in warm blankets, hot bottles s 01 be applied to the feet, and fr-iction to the hands and surface ; a little uarm tea, vine, or spirits and water, may be administered, provided the msensibflity be not complete ; if it be complete, the fluid should not be given, as It niight then find its way into the larynx. In these circumstances, ammonia should be applied to the nostrils, and a stimulating enema admi- nistered. When there is much pain associated with the shock, a few drops of au anum may advantageously be given. By such treatment as this, the cileries of the neiwous and vascular systems are gradually restored ; and then reaction speedily comes on. Operation during occurs in these cases ; continuance of shock. Shock.—A question of considerable importance fr-equently viz., whctlier an operation should be performed during the As a general rule, it certainly should be deferred untili82 constitutional EFFECTS OF INJURY. icactioii conics on, as tlie additional injury inflicted by the operation would increase the depression under wliich the patient is suffering. In some cases, however, the presence of a crushed limb appears to prolong the shock, and thus prevent the patient from rallying, notwithstanding the admim'stration of stimulants. In these circumstances the Singeon would be justified in operating before reaction came on. Here the administration of cliloroform in moderate quantity is extremely beneficial : it exercises a sustaining influence, not only by acting as a stimulant to the nervous system, but by preventing the pain and dread of the operation from still further depressing the iltal energies. In these cases of long-continued shock, great care is requned in ascertaining that there is no internal injiuy giving rise to the depression, but that the shock is really dependent upon the mangled state of the limb. After the immediate effects of the shock have entirely passed away, we must adopt means to prevent the remote consequences. With this view—if the patient can bear it—blood-letting is often of essential sendee, and is, I think, far too much neglected at the present day. In addition to this, the patient’s diet and habits of life should be carefrilly regulated, over-stimidation being especially avoided ; his bowels should be kept frnely open, and his general health attended to. TRAUMATIC FEVER. After the immediate effects of shock have passed off, the reaction wliich ensues may not pass the limits of health. In other cases however, and also in instances where the shock may have been but slight, a general febrile state arises. This febrile condition, followhig injmies and sm’gical operations, has been ably investigated and described in late years, especially by Bilh’oth, who distinguishes between the true traumatic fevm-, occiuTing at an early period after the receipt of the injiuy, and inflammatory secondary fever, the result of the supervention of inflammation in the 'vicinity of the woiuid. Traumatic Fever is, according to BiUi’oth, the result of the absorption of decomiiosed materials fr’om the siuface of the wound. It generally commences on the second day, and, after increasing rapidly, remains (vith remissions) at nearly the same height for nine days, and then ceases. The temperatiue may rise to 102° or even 104° Fahr. The pulse is generally frequent in proportion to the temperatiue. The decline or defervescence of the fever is sometimes rapid, occuning in a period varying from twenty-foiu to thirty-six hours ; sometimes it is slow, and in these cases Billroth has noticed it to bo attended liy ei'ening exacerbations. Inflammatory Fever usually ai’ises fr'om inflammation of the parts in the neighbourhood of the woiuid, and may be the result of the slow throwing off of destroyed tissues, as fascia or tendon, or of the presence of foreign bodies. It may also be produced by retained secretions in closed wounds, or by reten- tion of the faeces and urine, or by consecutive inflammation of other organs and tissues. It may occur when there ha've been no ajipreciable symptoms of traumatic fever ; or it may follow the traumatic fever. Its course, variations, and treatment have been already described in speaking of the febrile conditions consecutive on inflammation {see Chapter IV.).REMOTE EFFECTS OF INJURY. 183 TKAUMATIC DELIRIUM. Traumatic Delirium not unfrequcntly occurs in cases of severe injury in iiulivicluals witli an in-itablc ner^'ous system, particularly in those uiio have l)een chinking freely before the accident, or were intoxicated at the time when it occiuTed. It usually comes on about the thhcl or foimth day, but }iot un- frequently earlier than this ; and most commonly declares itself during the night. This disease presents two distinct types, which are, in fact, different diseases—the one inflammatory, the other irritative. In Inflammatory Traumatic Delirium there are a quick and bounding pulse, hot skin and head, flushed cheeks, glistem’ng eyes, much thirst, and high febrile action generally. The delirium is usually fimious ; the patient shout- ing, singing, tossing himself about the bed, and moving the injm-ed limb insensible to, or regardless of, pain. The Treatment of this form of the disease should be depletory. Bleeding fr'om the arm, with leeches and ice to the head, piu’ging and low diet, udll subdue it; but in many cases it is speedily fatal. Irritative or Nervous Traumatic Delirium usually occiu’S in persons of a broken constitution, and closely resembles ordinary dehrium tremens; sometimes it is preceded by a fit of an epileptiform character. In this form of the disease the pulse is quick, small, and initable ; the pupils dilated ; the siu'face cool; the coimteiiauce pale, mth an anxious haggard expression, and bedewed with a clammy sweat. The tongue is white, and there is sometimes tremor of it as weh as of the hands ; but this by no means invariably occiu’s. The delirium is usually of a muttering and suspecting character ; the patient is often hai-assed by spectral illusions, but vdll answer rationally when spoken to. This form of disease is sometimes very rapidly fatal. I have known it to destroy life in cases of simple fractine in less than twelve horns. The Treatment of irritative traumatic delirium consists essentially in the administration of opium until sleep is procured, pr the pupil becomes con- tracted. For this piu’pose large quantities are frequently required ; and the opiimi shoifld be given in full doses, two grains to begin "with, and repeated every second or third horn in grain doses. If there be much dejDi’ession, it mil usually be expedient to administer the opiate in porter, or in that stimulant to which the patient has habituated himself. The administration of the opiate should be preceded by a free pmge and an aperient enema, so that aU source of irritation may be removed from the intestinal canal. Hypodermic injections of morphia may be used advanta- geously in traumatic delirium, when the patient cannot or will not swallow. I he essential point is to set the brain at rest by sleep. A strait-waistcoat is commonly necessary iir all cases of trarrmatic delirirmr, in order to preverrt the patient from injrrriirg the rvounded part. After sleep has beeir induced, the quairtity of the opiate must be lesserred ; but it will bo fouird rrecessary to C'oiflinrre it for some time, as there will be a teirderrcy to the rccurrerrce of the delirium at night. Ihese two forms of traumatic delirirrm, the inflanrmatory arrd the irritative, ^ue often found more or less conjoined ; a modification of the treatmerrt thcri recomes rcqmsrtc,—the Rurgcoir depletiirg with one harrd, and allayino- irrita- tion by oprates and giving srrpport with the other.COXSl'ITUTTONAL ^JFFECTS OF INJURY. 184 KEMOTE EEPEOTS OP INJURY. These may he consUtuHonal or locaJ. The Remote Constitutional Effects of injuries are of a very variecl cha- racter. In some cases, persons who have met with serious injury will be found to die suddenly, some mouths after apparent recoveiy. lu others, they gradually tall out of health, the nutrition of the body appearing to become impaired,- and auo3mia and a cachectic state supervening. In other instances, again, the timctions of the nervous system become distinbed ; coimilsive movements or paralytic symptoms of a slight but persistent character eventually develop themselves, and may become progressive, terminating in organic disease of the nervous centres. In these cases, the immediate influence exercised by the injmy on the neiwous system seems to pass off, while a peimanent impression is left. The patient never completely recovers from the effects of his injmy : he is never, to use the common expression, “ the same man again ; ” and, although his health may appear to improve from time to time, yet, on close inquiry and careful investigation, it Avill be found that there has been a continuous train of symptoms indicative of a disordered state of the nervous system. These remote constitutional effects, to which attention has been directed by Hodgkin and James, often do not manifest themselves for weeks or months after the infliction of the injmy. Some change appears to be induced in the condition of the blood, or in the action of the nervous system, that is incom- patible with health. Perhaps, as Hodgkin supposes, the part locally injined becomes incapable of proper nutritive action, and thus a morbid poison results, in consequence of some peculiar combination of the chemical elements of the part, by w'hich the w'hole system is influenced. Be this as it may, the fact remains certain, that constitutional disturbance, serious illness, or even sudden death, may supervene, as a result of a local injmy, a considerable time after its infliction. Remote Local Effects.—There can be little doubt that many structimal diseases owe their origin to long antecedent injimes. The nutrition of a j)art may be modifled to such an extent by a blow or wound inflicted upon it, as to occasion those alterations in the structure which constitute true organic disease. Thus W'e occasionally And, on death occiuTing some months after a severe injury, that extensive local mischief, usually of an inflammatoiy character, is disclosed, which has eHdently been going on in an insidious maimer from the time of the accident. In other cases again, a blow may give rise to severe and long-continued nem-algic pains in a part, or it may be the direct occasioning cause of struc- tural disease in bones, joints, or blood-vessels; and, lastly, it may be the origin of cancer, many cases of wdiich can be distinctly refen-ed to external violence.185 CONTUSIONS. CHAPTER IX. INJUKIES OF SOFT PAPtTS. These consist of Confusions and Wounds. CONTUSIONS. In a Contusion tlie skin is unbroken, but there is always some laceration of the subcutaneous structures. Indeed, great disorganisation of these occasionally takes place, though the skin continues entire, owing to its greater elasticity and touglmess. Hence a contusion may be looked upon as being a subcutaneous lacerated wound. In contusions there is always extravasation of blood into the tissues to a greater or less degree. When slight, this extrayasation is termed an ecchyniosis. The blood is not shed outwardly, but accumulates imder the skin in the areolar tissue, or in internal organs, presentmg in the former situation the ordinary piu-plish-black discoloration of a bruise. The amount of blood extrawasated wiU of course depend upon the yascularity of the part contused. The arrest of the extravasation takes place in a great measme by the eifused blood pent up amongst the tissues, coagulating over and compressing the torn vessels which have poured it forth, and thus restraining the fm-ther escape of blood from them, and aUovdng the ordinary process of repair of wounded vessels to take place. Causes.—Contirsions may result from direct pressure, as Avhen a part is forcibly squeezed ; fe’om a direct Mow, usually by a hard blunt body ; or from an indirect blow, as when the hip-joint is contused by a person falling on his fcqt fr’om a height. Gompo'ession of the parts injured is always irecessary to constitute a con- tusion. This compression may occiu' between the force oir one side, and a l)one as the resisting medium on the other ; or the part injured may be compressed and contused between two forces in action—as when the hand is caught between two revolving wheels ; or between a force in action and a passive medium—as by a Avheel passing over the limb and crushing it against the ground. Deurees.—The amoimt of extravasation of blood consequent on a contusion ■''ill necessarily maiidy depend upon the force employed in its production, but also^ to some considerable extent upon the state of health of the individual bi-uiscd. In persons out of health, with soft tissues and the Idood in a low state, bruising very readily occurs. Contusions arc of various degTces : theyINJURIES OF SOFT FARTS. i86 may be an-anged as follows :-l,ofthe Skin only; 2, with Extravasation into e Areolar Tissue; 8, Avith Subcutaneous Laceration of the Soft Parts ; and 4, with Subcutaneous Disorganisation of the Soft and Hard Parts! u tha first degree, the blood is merely effused into the skin, producing ecc j^osis 01 binise ; the colour of which varies at different iieriods fi’om pinp is 1-1 e to gieenish-broAvn, this variation being dependent upon changes that take place in the extravasated blood as it undergoes absorption. In the second degree a bag of blood can often be felt fluid and fluctuating under the skin, in Avhich state it may remam for AA-eeks or even months Avithout undergoing ^ any material change, provided it be excluded from the air. In othei cases it gradually becomes absorbed ; or, if it commmncate AAlth the air, the bag being opened in any Avay, it may undergo disintegration, suppiu-ation taking place aromid it, and the clots discharging through an abscess. In some cases it AA'ould appear, fr-om the observations of P. HeAA'ett and of Paget, that the clot resulting fr’om extiwasated blood may become organised and finally lienetrated by blood-vessels. The French pathologists have described the for- mation of a cyst containing serous fluid in the site of the extraA^asated blood. These cysts are composed of a fibrous structiue, but AA'ithout cells ; they liaA'e no distinct lining membrane, and in their interior serous or grumous fluid, composed of disintegrated blood, is fbiuid. In other cases the serous or fluid parts are absorbed, and the solid matters, forming cheesy concretions, are left behind. Lastly, cxtraA’asatcd blood may give rise to a sanguineous tumoiu, Haeiuatoina, the blood, Avluch may continue for months, or CA^en years, fluid, but stiU not imchanged, becoming darker, treacly, and more or less disinte- grated, and eventually intermixed AAoth A'arious products of inflammation. In the tim'd and fourth degrees of contusion the laceration and disorganisa- tion of structiues usually lead to sloughing and suppination, or to raj)id gangrene of the parts, or to hasmoiThage, ending in fatal syncope ; or, Avhen the contusion is of an internal organ, this hasmorrhage may proA'e fatal by taking jAlace into the serous cavities. When the contusion is superficial, the Inemorrhage is subcutaneous, and, though abimdant, is rarely in sulficient <|uantity to influence the heart’s action. In one remarkable case, hoAvever, in AA'hich a schoolmaster was convicted of manslaughter for beating a boy to deatli AA-ith a stick, and in which I Avas called to make a i30st mortem examination, death had evidently resulted, in a great measiue at least, fr-om this cause : the subcutaneous areolar tissue of the foiu- limbs being extensively torn away fr-om the fasciae, and uniformly filled AA'ith extraA'asated blood, AA^hilst the intenial organs were in an anaemic condition, the pulmonary A'essels and the coronary arteries of the heart even being- emptied of blood. Diagnosis.—This is not abi-ays easy. The minor degrees may be mistaken for incipient gangrene, the discoloration not being- A'ery dissimilar ; but the part, when simply contused, presei-A’es its temperature and A'itality. In some cases the extraA’asated blood has a hard circumscribed border, and is soft in the centre, AA'hich in the scalp resembles someAA'hat a depression in the subjacent bone. The diagnosis of old cases of extravasation, leading to hnsmatoma, fr-om abscess or malignant disease, is not alAA-ays easily made by tactile examination only ; but the history of the case, exploration Avith a grooved needle, andTREATMENT OF CONTUSION. 187 examination of the contents of the tumour imdcr the microscope, will always clear np any doubt that may exist. TiiKATiiECT.—In the lix-st two degi’ees of contusion, om- great object should l)c to excite, as speedily as possible, the absorption of the extravasated blood.^ Here cold applications are of especial service ; lotions composed of one part of spirits of wine to eight or ten of water should be constantly apphed. Leeches —commonly used in these cases—shoidd not be applied to a bruised part; they cannot remove the blood that has already been extravasated, and often set np great iiritation, which leads to suppimation. The bag of blood should never be opened, however soft,and fluctuating it may feel, so long as there is any chance of procuring its absorption by discutient remedies. If once it be punctiu’ed and air be allowed to enter, putrefactive suppuration vdll be set up in it. But if signs of inflammation occm’ around it, the parts becoming red, hot, and painfully throbbing, free incisions should at once be made, the blood —aheady disorganised and mixed with pus—^be discharged, and the cavity allowed to granulate. Pm-ging and general depletory treatment wiU often promote absorption of the extravasation. In the third and foiuth degrees of contusion, it is generally useless to attempt to save the life of the injiued part. Here poultices must be applied to hasten suppiuation and the separation of the sloughs ; the ulcer that results being treated on general principles. Disorganising contusions of the most severe kind may be recovered fr’om P'ovided time he m external wound, even though the soft structures of the limb or pai-t be extensively crushed, the bones comminuted, and the joints opened. It is not the subcutaneous lacerations and disorganisations that are to be dreaded ; so long as the main blood-vessels of the part injured are intact, these may be recovered from. But it is the admission of air into the interioy of a badly injured limb that constitutes the great danger. If this can be avoided there is little fear of undue inflammation being excited, provided proper precautions are taken ; but if air be once admitted into the lacerated tissues, suppuratix'e and sloughing action is at once set up, and the safety of the patient will be seriously imperilled. In such cases as these, amputation is usually the sole resoiu’ce, unless the progress of the mischief can be arrested by the employment of the antiseptic treatment or some equally efficient plan. flhe difference between the effects of a subcutaneous laceration and one accompanied by open wound is well exemplified in the cases of a “ simple ” and a compound dislocation. In the first case, although the ligaments and capsulai muscles are extensively torn, often vdtli great extrax'asation of blood, repail takes place ivithout any serious trouble, often with scarcely any inflam- ^ matoiy action ; whilst in tlie compound dislocation, where air has boon admitted, the most extensive suppurative action necessarily ensues, and joint, nub, or life, one or other, is in great danger of being irretrievably lost. Contusions of internal organs are always very serious, and require special rcatment, according to the part that is affected, and the extent of its injury. Strangulation of Parts.—This, ivhen accidental, occasionally occurs as G consequence of the application of a constricting ligature or bandage, or the s ippmg of a tight ring over a part. In such cases, the first effect of''this con- stnction 13 to prevent the retimi of the venous blood ; this impediment to theINJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. i88 circulation occasions serous effusion, and swelling of an oeclematous character. It relief be not afforded to the circulation by the removal of the constrictnig body, distention of the vessels, stagnation of the blood, loss of vitality of the jiart, and gangTene will speedily ensue. Hence the treatment consists in at once di\-iding or remoAing the cord or ring, as the case may be. Usually this is easily done, but in some cases it is attended with no little difficulty. This especially happens ivhen a small ring has been hurriedly put on a Avroug finger, or Avhen the penis has been draAvn through a brass ring. In such'cases as these the member swells greatly, and the difficulty of removing the foreign body is very considerable. The finger-ring may usually be removed by slipping a director under it, and clipping or filing it across upon this. Sometimes the following popular plan may advantageously be adopted. A strong silk thi’ead is carefully bound round the finger as tightly as possible from the point down to the ring, and through this the free end is earned with a needle : the thread is then slowly untwisted, and the ring is thus can-ied upon it off the finger. Curtain or other brass rings compressing the root of the penis haA*e been known sloAvly and gradually to cut thimigh the organ, without destroying its vitahty or rendering the inethi’a impervious. But such a fortunate result is altogether the exception ; in the great majority of such cases, unless the ring be speedily cut offj mortification of the organ Avould ensue, and might be foUownd, as it has been in some instances, by the death of the patient. WOUNDS. A Avoimd may be defined, in the words of Wiseman, as “ a solution of con- tinuity in any part of the body, suddenly made by anything that cuts or tears, AAith a division of the skin.” Siu’geons divide wmimds into Incised, Lacerated, Contused, Punctured, and Poisoned. There are, therefore, five kinds of wounds, and, as we have already seen, five modes of healing. INCISED WOUNDS. Incised woiuids may vary in extent from a simple superficial cut to the incision required in amputation at the hip-joint. Incised w'oimds are usually open, the air having free access to them; occasionally, however, Avhen made by the Singeon, they are subcutaneous, only communicating externally by a small punctine. They may be simple, merely implicating integnment or integiunent and muscle ; or they may be complicated AAdth injiuy of the lai’ger vessels and nerves, or of important organs. Symptoms.—In all cases incised woimds gi^n rise to three symptoms ; viz., Pain, Htemorrhage, and Separation of the lips of the wound. The Pain in an incised wmmd is usually of a cutting, burning, or smarting character. Dr. J. Johnson compared his own sensations to the pain produced by a stream of molten lead falling upon the part. Much depends, howeA'er, on the extent and situation of the Avound ; and also Avhether the cut has been made finm the cutaneous sinface inwards, or froin AAdthin outAvai’ds ; in the foimer case the pain is gveater than in the latter, because the nerves are diAadcd from the branches toAvards the tnuik ; Avhereas, Avhen the cut is from AvithiiiMANAGEMENT OF INCISED WOUNDS. 189 outwards, the trunks are divided first, and the terminal branches being thus paralysed, do not feel the subsequent incision. The amount of Hamorrhage necessarily depends upon the vascularity ot tnc part as well as on the size of the woimd. The proximity of the part wounded to the centre of the circulation, or to a large vessel has also a A'ery considerable influence different parts of the same tissue bleeding with different dcgi-ees of fieility • ’thus the skin of the face yields when cut more blood than that of the leo- Aouin, the same parts will, under different states of irritation, poim out different quantities ; the cut smface of the tonsils has been known to bleed after their partial excision to such an extent as to cause death, although usually but a few drops ai’o lost. The Separation of the Lips of the Wound depends on the tension and the position of the part as well as on the elasticity and vital contractility of the tissues ; it is also influenced by the direction of the incision, according as this is parallel with the axis of a limb or muscle or across it. It is greatest in those parts that are natmaUy the most elastic or that possess the highest degree of tonicity ; thus the muscles when cut retract some inches, the arteries and skin gape ■widely Avhen di’^ided, whereas in the case of ligaments or bones, no retraction takes place. Maxagement op Incised Wounds.—In the treatment of an incised Avound, we must alAA’ays endeavom to procine inmiediate union (p. 172) or miion by pri- mary adhesion (p. 174) betAA'een a portion, if not the whole, of the siufaces, for reasons affeady assigned. The probability of procming adhesion depends greatly upon the constitution of the patient; it is a decided and most dangerous error, and as unscientific as it is dangerous, to suppose that success or failiue is entirel}'' dependent on local conditions and the management of the AA’Oiuid itself. In some constitutions it is impossible, luider the most favoiuable circumstances, to obtain it. The sounder the constitution, the more readily Avill union by the first intention take place, and in all cases it is disposed to by the remoA’al of all sources of UTitation from the system, and by the adoption of a supporting regimen. Repair, like all other physiological processes, is attended AAuth an expenditure of vital force directly proportioned to the extent to Avhich plastic material is separated from the blood ; hence anything approaching to a loAvering plan of treatment is to be aA'oided, though the opposite error of over-stimu- lation is equally to be deprecated. Thus, in those operations, the plastic, for instance, in which it is necessary that the union be as direct as possible, the patient should be prepared by being kept for some time preAdously upon a diet ■chiefly consisting of milk and light animal food, by taking regular exercise, ■and by the administration of iron ; Ave should also look specially to the state of the digestive and luinary organs. In cases of accidental Avound, aa'c must keep the patient quiet, put him on a moderate diet, and be very cautious in the administration of stimulants, as they have a great tendency to interfere Avith union by the first intention. It must be borne in mind, that the great ■object is to limit inflammation ; for if this be carried beyond Avhat is necessary for plastic effusion, suppurative action Avill certainly folloAV. We inust not lose sight, too, of the fiict, that homogeneity of tissue in the opposed siufaces is essential to union by the first intention.

Local Treatment. ■There is no subject in Smgery which has undergone more frequent modifications than the local treatment of wounds, from the earliest periods of which we have record. The first, and perhaps the instinc- tive, method of treating a womid was to close it up at once and to exclude the air by fixing upon its bps a mass of clay, of chewed leaves, or of cow or camel’s dung. The admission of air was fru’ther jirevented by pom-ing oil into it, and its putretaction by the use of wine or balsams. At a later period in the histoiy of om- art, tents of various kinds were used, and employed up to a very recent period, in order to keep it open and thus to prevent the injmious accumulation in its ca^dty of discharges, which there might decompose and putrefy. The closiu-e of the wound—the exclusion of air—the prevention of putrefaction in its discharges by the use of spirituous and stimulating antiseptics, or by facilitating the escape of the secretions, ivere the means employed from the earliest antiquity ; without, however, that recognition of those principles involved in the use of the various medicaments and appliances adopted, which it has been reserved for a later and more scientific age to determine and elucidate. And it is still these four gi’eat principles—the closiu-e of the wound—the exclusion of air—the prevention of putrefaction—and the facihtation of the escape of discharges that guide us in the treatment of all wounds, however different, and in some respects improved, the means may be by which we endeavoim to caiTy them out. In the local treatment then of aU incised ivoimds, there are four chief indi- cations, viz., 1, the Arrest of Hcemorrliage ; 2, the Removal of Foireign Bodies ; 3, the Coa2)tation of the Sides of the Wound; 4, the Prevention of Decomposition in the Wound. These we shall consider more in detail. 1. Arrest of Haemorrhage.—If bleeding be general from the siu’face, it may be stopped by exposine to the air, by elevation of the womided part, by acemate and firm coaptation, by the pressiu’e of a weU-apphed bandage or of the finger over the spot, and by the use of cold or other styiitics ; if it be arterial, by ligatme, torsion, or acupressm-e. In making choice of a htemo- static, preference is to be given to one that will interfere the least with miion by the first intention. Thus, amongst styjitics, cold, in the shape of ice or of rags VTung out of cold water, is to be preferred to others of the same class, such as the perchloride of iron, which are all more or less caustic and in-itant. Again, torsion should be employed when it can be done with safety, rather than the hgaturc, which, by its retention in the woimd, offers an obstacle to the occurrence of primaiy union. In short, the simpler the remedy the better. 2. The Removal of Foreign Bodies, such as dirt, pieces of stone and glass, spicula of bone, coagulated blood, &c., is best effected by allowing a stream ot water fr’om a sponge or irrigator to fall upon the jiart, all rough handling ot the wounded tissue being avoided as much as possible. Shaiqi and angular bits imbedded amongst the tissues should be removed by forceps. Aboi'c all, this cleansing of the wound is to be done thoroughly, and once for all; a com- ])aratively insignificant body, if overlooked at this time, may effectually prei cut adhesion by setting up siqipnrativc action, whilst disturbance of the voimdCOAPTATION OF SURFACES. 191 attcr it has been once closed, destroys tlie layer of effused fibrine 'which ought to form the bond of union. 8. The next and most important indication to fulfil, is the Coaptation of the Opposed Surfaces and the Exclusion of Air as accurately as possible. As a general rule, the sides should not be brought together until all luemon-hage has ceased ; if, however, there be but slight oozing, this may be aiTested by the approximation, and the pressure thus exercised on the bleeding vessels. Before doing so, however, the whole extent of the wound should be washed with an antiseptic solution, to obviate as much as possible snbsecpient decomposition. For this piu'pose a wateiy solution of carbolic acid (1 to 40) is the best; some prefer a lotion (10 gr. to si) of chloride of zinc, or sulphiu-ous acid, or ether. The surfaces should then be gently brought together, from behind foiwwrds, so as to thoroughly exclude aU air and super- fluous moisture fi'om the deeper portions of the wound, the skin margin being the last to be adjusted; due attention should at the same time be paid to relaxing the parts by position, so that there may be no gainng of the bps nor tension on the sides of the wound. The airangement of the parts should be such that there may be a ready escape for the serous oozing, which must necessarily ensue in wounds that do not at once adhere throughout their whole extent. This should be allowed to take j)lace from Avhat will be eventually the most dependent point of the wound ; and where ligatures have been used, the threads should be brought out at the same spot. The ligatures, if thick and numerous, A\iU serve as a conduit or drain for the fluids that are poured out by the cut surfaces. But in addition to these, and in all cases in which they are cut short, it may be well to insert a “ drainage-tube ” into the wound, and retain it there fr-om 48 hoiu’s to several days, according to the amount and character of the discharge. The value of the drainage-tube in preventing the accranulation of blood, of bloody senun, and of pus, cannot be over-estimated. It is the greatest safe- guard we have against decomposition of fluids and their accumulation in the V oinid, and this more than any other means favours cohesion of its oj)posite sides, and secures the patient from all danger of septic contamination. Its use should never be omitted, especially if the woimd be deep and irregular, or if there be danger of bagging under a flap. For the purpose of keej)ing all in position, sutures, plaster Si and bandages are employed. ^ S^itures should be used as httle as possible. They are painful in their introducMon, instating in their presence, and often troublesome as well as painfr I in their removal. They also tend to favour bagging, by causing supei-ficial union, whilst the deeper parts still gape. With aU their disad"- vantages, they must, however, be employed when there is more tendency to gaping than can be overcome by position or plasters. Threads of well-annealed SI \ei 01 iron wire, of ^'arious degrees of stoutness, are now more generally iisec t an those ot silk, as they are less iiritating, are incapable of imbibing the secretions of the wound, and, when once adjusted, keep the form first o'ivcii 0 em. In cases, however, where the sutures are only retained for a day or JVC 1 IS not of much moment which material is used; if it be sifle, it should be Su nx "•“«! ^ a<= tl'icknoss should v„ry tho uatmo and situation of the iiijiiiy. Thus, iii ivounds of the limbs(INJURIES OF SOFT FARTS. m Avlierc much traction may be expected, the suture' should be thick ; whilst ... those eases in which it is of importance that as little deformity as possible should bo loft, e.g., in plastic operations and in wounds about the face, it sliould consist of the finest material compatible Avith strength. The threads arc introduced by means of needles of different curves : in some instances it is convenient to have them set in a handle Avith the eye near the point (nsevus- ncedle), instead of in the ordinary position. For metallic thi-eads a slight modification of the ordinary needle is recpiu-ed, to prevent the AAire Avhen doubled back after passuig through the eye from offering any obstruction to its passage through the tissues ; “ tubular ” needles are also employed for this purpose. The modes of applying sutm-es are A'arious; but the one most commonly employed in aU cases involAung the integument, is the interrupted, Avhich consists of the introduction of as many single stitches, from an inch to an inch and a half apart, as may be necessaiy to close the opening. In longi- tudinal wounds, the first stitch should be inserted in the centre ; but if there be any angles, as must be the case after crucial incisions, the extremities should be first closed; if more than one sutiu-e be required, they should all be in position before the first is fastened. The fastening is effected in the case of the silk thread by tying the reef-knot, and in that of the Avire, by tAAisting the ends round one another ; in both instances, the ends arc cut off short. The knot or tAAist must not lie OA’er the line of incision, but on one or other side of it. The time that the sutures should be alloAved to remain, must depend greatly on the nature and progTess of the wound ; as a rule, from 24 to 48 hours is suificient; by that time they aaIII have answered their purpose of jDrocining union of the opposed siu’faces. EA-ery minute they are left in after this is detrimental to adhesion, and is attended AAith the risk of the excitation of undue reaction. The AA'ire suture may, however, in some cases be advanta- geously retained for a much longer period, CA'cn for six, eight, or ten days; but at hist even this will produce ulceration. In vithdraAving sutm-es, the knot or tAvist should be raised by forceps, and the thi-ead diiided on one side of it ; gentle traction on the knot, the forefinger of the other hand being- placed close near the point of exit in the skin, to prevent disturbance of the ncAA-ly formed lymph, AAfill then suffice to draAV the suture out. When Avire has been used, the bends in it should be straightened as much as possible before pulling- them out. In the continuous suture, or glover’s stitch, the thread is carried on fr-om stitch to stitch, instead of being detached fr-om the needle, and fastened off as in the interrupted suture. The stitches are placed nearer together, so that the adjustment of the edges is more intimate. Either metallic or silk tln-cad can be employed ; in AvithdraAving it, each loop must be divided, and each piece remoA’ed separately, as in the common stitch. Ibis foim of sntuic is not aci} often employed, but it may be used in simple incisions of some length, such as those that are left after the removal of tumours in the trunk, or arc required in ovariotomy, in Avounds of the intestines, &c. The quilled suture is employed Avhere the sides of a deep longitudinal avouiuI are required to be kept in contact throughout, as in ruptured pciinaium. It consists of a scries of double inteiTiipted sutures ol stout silk oi A\hipcoicSUTURES AND PLASTERS. 193 passed deeply, through the loops of which, that hang out on one side of the wound, is passed a piece of bougie, or quill, whilst the ends of the thread arc tightly tied over a similar cylinder on the opposite side. The stitehes should enter and emerge about half an inch from the line of ineision, and be so placed that the cylinders when in sifn lie parallel to one anotlier. Fine intemipted sutures may be used in addition, to connect the supeifrcial parts. The twisted or figure-of-8 suture is very eommonly employed in surgery. A slender pin, made of soft iron, with a steel point, is introduced through each lip of the wound, at a distance of about one-third of an inch from the margins ; and, whilst the latter are held in contact, a piece of silk twist is passed in a figure-of-8 round the pin, care being taken not to draw it too tight, nor to compress the soft parts between the needle and the thread, lest sloughing ensue. The projecting ends of the pin are now cut off with pliei-s, and the skin beneath them protected with plaster. This sutme is invanably used in the treatment of hare-lip ; but it is of gveat serviee wherever the lips of the wound are very vascular ; it has the advantage, likewise, of taking the tension off the suture, and transferring it to the tissues themselves, so that it is less likely to cut its way out than the intemipted sutme. The pin may be vithcfravui in about forty- eight hom’s. jj M The serrefine (Fig. 80), a twisted coil of silver wire, with the Jgj/ extremities terminating in small hooks, by means of which the / ? edges are kept in contact, may be had recomse to in cases 'where very acciu-ate union of the lips of a womid is required, as in so.—rue cuts about the face, and the like. The inventor, Vidal de Cassis, seneane. recommends a large number to be used, and that they should be allowed to remain in twenty-four horns. They are made in sizes one to six, the latter being the largest. Plasters are of various kinds, those most commonly employed being the resin, soaji, and isinglass plasters. Each of them possesses peculiar properties, fitting it for use in particidar cases. The resin plaster has the adAantage of being most adhesive, and of not being readily loosened by discharge ; but, on the other hand, it is irritating, sticky, difficult to remove, and, in conse- quence of the lead that it contains, leaves a dirty-looking incrustation behind it. ^ Ihe soap plaster-is less instating, but at the same time less adhesiA’e ; it is consequently not much used in the management of woiuids. The isinglass plaster is doubtless the most cleanly and least irritating of all, and, being tia;nsparent, permits the Siugeon to see what is taking place beneath it ; but it is^ieadily loosened by the discharges, and is apt to run into a cord. ^ "W hichever A'ariety is used, the plaster should be cut into strips of conve- nient length and breadth, and heated by being passed through hot water. All ' supei-fluous hair having been removed, and the surface Avell dried, each strii) should be laid doAvn evenly between the points of suture, Avhen these haA'e been used, so as to compress and support each side of the wound with ecnial force ; the longer the strip, the firmer will be its holding, and the less likely it 1)0 to he prematurely loosened. ] n removing the plaster, both ends should je raised at the same time toAvards the Avound, and the strip should then ba V^OL, I, ^ 0194 INJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. taken off without citlicv lip of the wound being unduly dragged upon. The strips should be allowed to remain undisturbed as long as possible, and each <me replaced before the next is remoyed. In a certain class of incised wounds, of limited extent, where the edges can be accurately adapted to one another by sutm-es or plaster, or by the combina- tion of both, and when but little oozing is to be expected, very fair union by scabbing may be looked for unthout any fiu'thor dressings. Indeed, some Surgeons prefer to treat such exteusive wounds as amputation-stumps in this way. The formation of the scab, however, may be hastened and imitated by the use of Collodion, painted freely over the line of incision with a camel’s hair brush, after the surface has been well dried, or of Styptic Colloid, which has the fiu’ther advantage of being hsemostatic and antiseptic. The film thus formed may be further strengthened by some shreds of chai^pie or fine lint. A second or third application of the collodion or styptic colloid will be required, if the crust show any sign of becoming detached ; otherwise it may be allowed to remain until it separates of itself, which it usually does in the coimse of a few days. Similarly, a piece of hnt soaked in blood, or in compound tinctme of benzoin, may be applied over the wormd, and under it, dfrect adhesion by a process analogous to that of scabbing may take place. When the wound is more extensive, and the simple measimes just described are impracticable, the edges are to be covered ufith a fold of hnt moistened in tepid Avater, to wliich carbolic acid has been added in the proportion of 1 to 100, over Avhich is laid a piece of oiled silk, or other impermeable material, a trifie larger in CAmy direction than the lint (water-di-essing), whilst the Avhole surface in the neighboimhood is kept cool by a piece of wet lint, or, if the inflammation threaten to run high, by irrigation. Some Siu’geons use the best olfre oil as an application in preference to water, as being more 8(Aothiug, less heating, and less prone to promote decomposition ; by others, a solution of sulphiu'ous acid is recommended (1 part of a satiu’ated solution to 7 or 8 of Avater). Carded oakum in place of lint has the advantage of being highly absorbent, cleanly, and antiseptic, but it is of greater service in suppu- rating wounds than in recent ones. The first dressings should be left unchanged for tAvo or three days ; the sutm-es may then be removed, and the plasters readjusted as they become loosened, care being taken to support the sides whilst doing so. One important point in the management of eA’ery Avomid, is to maintain, as much as possible, the injiu-ed structures in a state ot rpsf. This is to be done by position, the Sm-geon refraining fr’om distm-bing the parts unnecessanly, using his eye rather than his hand to judge of the | progress made, and by the use of compresses and bandages. Gompressos of soft" linen or lint should be so disposed as to aid in keeping the sides in apposition, whilst they prevent the collection of fluids in the recesses of the woimd ; the lanclaqes shoxdd be applied over them so as to exert a steady well- regulated pressure,'but not to impede the fi-ee circulation of blood in the pmt. 4. The next gi-eat point in the treatment of wonnds is the prevention of decomposition. The decomposition of the fluids of a atouikI is due to their infection by septic matter. In some cases it is possible that such septic infection may be the result of morbid states of the blood or tissues ot the patient. But these instances of self-infection are rare and exceptional.195 INFECTION OF WOUNDS. 111 other instances, again, the decomposition of the woimd is predisposed to, though not actually detennined, by the state of the patient’s constitution. In the vast majority of cases—when it occins—^it is the direct result of the infection of the Avound from without. The decomposition of the fluids of a wound, in Avhatever way occasioned, is a bar to its healing by “the first intention ; ” it is productive of unhealthy suppination—certainly of delay— possibly of constitutional contamination and general blood-poisoning. The infection of wounds takes place thi-ough the medium of the air. If a Avoimd be AA'holly subcutaneous, Avithout any breach of the superimposed integuments, through AA'hich the air can gain entry, no infection can take place in it. Hence the difference betAveen the liability to septic diseases— to those diseases, such as pyaemia, hospital gangTeue, &c.—of a person who has sustained a subcutaneous AA'ound, hoAA'Cver extensive, as, for instance, the comminated fracture of a bone, AA’ith much laceration of soft parts, and of one Avho has suffered fr’om an open Avound of a con-esponding character—as a compoiuid fracture. The question necessarily arises, Hoav does the air infect ? And this great question includes three minor ones, viz., Is the air itself the infecting material ? If not, is it the medium or the vehicle of the conveyance of infection ? And if it be the A'ehicle, does the infection occur from gases or by solid particles can’ied in the air ? The ausAA'er to the first question involves the AA'hole subject of auto- and helei-o-fjemsis of spontaneous generation and that by germs—a subject that has occupied the attention and has exercised the ingenuity of scientific men of all ages and aU countries, fr-om the time of Aristotle, and AA^hich appears to be as far fr-om its ultimate solution now as it Avas when he AATote “ De Auimaliiun Generatione.” The discussion of this subject would be altogether out of place here ; and for its consideration I must refer the reader to the aatItings of Pasteur, Lister, Bastian, and TyndaU. ^ So far as our 2)resent piu-pose is concerned, it may be sufficient to state that Lister has shown conclusi\’ely that j)utrescible fluids, such as urine and milk, may be exposed for months to the action of filtered air AAuthout undergoing decomposition, and that air dej)rived of extraneous bodies is not per so, and ii)de|)eiidently of other agents or conditions, sufficient to occasion decomposi- tion. That absolutely piu-e air may not be the cause of decomj)osition in healthy but putrescible animal fiuids, apjjears to be established by these obser- Aabions. But it has not been proved, audit by no means follows, that the decomposition of morbid secretions, such as are generated by inflamed tissues, 01 deA eloped in diseased conditions of the blood, may not be hastened by exposure to the oxidising influence of even perfectly pm-c air. In fact, ecompositions of pus as manifested by the iirescnce of Bacteria Avill take p ace in certain ^ conditions, as in subperiosteal abscess, and elseAA'here m places into Avhich no air has been admitted or is admissible. That le spontaneous development of putrescent sanies or pus in certain states 0 the system may take place on the surface of Avounds, there can be no toiut; and the action even of chemically and microscopically pm-e air on uci fluids, the product of diseased tissues, and already, ab oriqine, nu- icscent emmot be other than to fiivour and hasten decomposition. But ‘‘Ithougb It must be admitted that the decomposition of sanies and pus o 2196 INJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. formed in diseased tissues in unhealthy constitutions may be hastened, and probably developed, by air that is perfectly pure, the cpiestion is in reality one of scientific and not of practical interest. For air is only found to lie chemi- cally and microscopically pure when it is artificially prepared for the puipose of experiment. In nature such a condition of the atmosphere does not exist—at least not Avithin reach of the habitations of man. Wherever man dAveUs, there the air becomes contaminated; and the amount of contamination in the air AA'ill, emteris parilus, be in the ratio of the density of the population on any given space. And it is as a medium or A'chiclc for the application of contaminating agents, generated by man and animals, and AA^hich, Avhen applied to open Avomids, and mixed AAdth their secretions, act as ferments and favoiu'ers of putrefaction, that ordinary atmospheric air acts so injuriously on Avounds. These contaminations contained in the atmosphere, as the result of human agencies, are of tAVO kinds—gaseous and solid. So far as AA'e knoAA", the gases that are admixed AAuth and deteriorate atmospheric air in its A'alue for the piu’poses of respiration, do not act injiniously on Avounds or on the secretions from injured smfaces. We must, therefore, look to the solid particles as the true infecting agents, conveyed to and implanted on the smface of open AA'ounds by the an, in Avhich they float suspended in countless myriads. Their existence in a state of suspension in the air has been proA^ed incontestably by the observations of Tyndall, and it has been shoAAUi that their iiatine AAill vary in different localities, according to the composition of the materials from Avhich they emanate. Their composition Avill necessarily A'ary in private houses and in pirblic buildings, in factories and in shops, in barracks and in hospitals. They are irrorganic and organic. The organic particles may be living or dead. But though dead, they may still be capable of infecting an open AA-ound on Avhich they are deposited. The epithelium of desquamating scarlatina, and the dried scab of the small-pox pustrde, thorrgh rrrrdorrbtedly dead organic matter, are irr the highest degvee irrfective. If this is so AAuth the prodrrets of these diseases, AA’e cannot suppose it is otherAAdse AAuth the orgarric emanatiorrs from erysipelas. pytemia, or hospital gangrene.

But, setting aside the consideration of these impurities in the shape of vapoiu-s, gases and fcetors, AV'ith the nature and operations of Avhich we are but imperfectly acquainted, we may state the follo^nng points in regard to infective atmospheric dust as established.* 1. Air that is absolutelypime, chemically, optically, and mechanically, cannot' infect a wound. 2. There is no evidence that tramnatic infection can occur- from chemical impm’ities in the air, such as gases. 8. There is no endence that it can occur fii-om the admixture of organic aqueous vapour Avith the air. 4. The infection of AA'ounds is due to the implantation on them, or in the se- cretions adherent to their siu-faces, of solid organic particles suspended in the air. 0. The air of rooms and of all inlrabited places is loaded with sohd particles in the foi-m of impalpable dust, a great portion of which is organic. The quantity is so great, that under a poAverful beam of electric hght the air appears as a semi-solid rather than as a gas (Tyndall). 6‘. The organic constituents of this dust vary in quahty in different localities. No air is absolutely free. It is found in the purest mountain air (White), and is present in sea-air (Eattray). 7. Its composition depends on the locality in which it is found, and the sources fr-om which it emanates. Thus, on board ship, besides consisting of various solid impiu-ities, of vegetable and a,nimal origin, fr-om the stores, AA'ood, cordage, whiteAvash, &c., it contains impin-ities throAAui off by the skin and lungs of the crew (Eattray). In barracks and mihtai-y hospitals, the air contains floating particles of epithelium from the skin and mouth (Parkes). <S. This organie dust does not necessarily by any means consist of dead materials. It has been found to be largely composed of the spores of fungi, the largest portions of AA-hich are liAung and capable of growth and develop- ment. Bacterial matter has also been found in di-y dust (Cunningham). 9. Hospital and sick room air contains large quantities of floating cpitheHum fr-om the skin and mouth, disintegi-ating pus-cells and putrefying organic matter (Parkes), dried constitiients of pus, and possibly A'ery small hving organisms (Billroth)—^bacteria in abundance (Lund). 10. the amount of impirrity aauII depend upon the number of the patients and the nature of the cases in any gWen Avard. Over-croAvding of wounded patients pollutes the air Avith the emanations fr-om the Avoimds. If the proportion of Avounded in i-elation to the size of the ward exceed a certain latio, then infection of the Avounds infallibly occurs “ The infection of the A\hole body comes from the Avound ” (Billroth). The ratio of the Avounded to the size of a given Avard may be calculated ; and if it exceed a certain proportion, infection of Avounds aaIU be induced, and septic disease Avill bo t ev eloped, and their occmi-ence may Avith absolute certainty be predicted (“ Hospitalism,” p. 62).

The more favourable the genera! hygienic conditions siUTomiding the patient, ccateris paribus, the more favour- able Avill be the prospect of the wound towards recovery. Every Avell known sanitary regulation as to diet, ventilation, temperature, and clothing should be adopted with this view. Blit the local hygienic conditions—those which directly and immediately affect the wound itself—are of still greater consequence. The woiuid is aii open portal through which the most deadly influences may readily gain entry into the stronghold of life. Hence it must be jealously and keenly watched. In private practice, and in the open country, fewer precautions may be necessary than in the wards of hospitals or the crowded Labitations of a large town. Were hospitals situated, constructed, and managed in accordance vith Avell knovni and universally received hygienic rules, much of the labom-, and the greater jiart of the anxiety, of the Surgeon would be spared; for the healing of a wound mider favomable hygienic circumstances is a simple affair—^\vhich, after the first needful attentions have been bestoAved upon it, after the bleeding has been arrested, the sm'faces cleaned, brought and held together— may usually be left to Hatine and to cleanliness. But the labom of the Surgeon is expended on, and his mind is anxiously directed to, the adoption of means to prevent infection of the wound ; and, if that infection have taken place, to prevent the local evil from contaminating the general system. It is by infection that simple Avounds, instead of imiting by the fli'st intention, become suppiu'ating chasms. It is by infection that putrefacth'e decomposition is set up on the suppurating surfaces. It is by infection that the foul and sloughy siu’face becomes the central point Avhence erysipelas spreads and pyiemia invades the system. Keep out infection, and local destruction, folloAved by constitutional contami- nation, is aA'erted. Admit it, and every cAdl, to those most terrible of aU, hos^iital gangrene, and pyaemia, may occiu’. The local hygienic precautions to be adopted consist in the most scrupulous attention to cleanliness : the exposime of the Avomid to an atmosphere im- poUnted by the reek of the out-patients’ rooms, or the feetor of the dead- house ; sponges only to be used in the operating theatre ; frequently rencAved and purified by carbolic acid ; the instruments, dressings, and Augers clean, and, Avhen used for the hAong, never allowed to come into contact AAuth the dead ; and, above all, never to be contaminated by putrescent matters. The clothes, the bedding, all those “fomites,'' which may harbour infectiA^e particles, should be carefully attended to. The more special method of pm-ifleation of chessiugs, and of preventing decomposition in the fluids of the Avound, must be effected by the use of antiseptics. The prevention of decomposition in the woimd may be effected in tAvo Avays, which are, indeed, usually combined, viz.': 1. By the employment of antiseptics, of which a vast number haA^e been employed in siu'gical practice —fi'om the Avine and balm of the ancient to the carbolic acid of the modern Siu’geon ; and 2. By securing free exit to the secretions of the Avounded surfaces, either by dressing the wound open ft’om the flrst, by closing it and keeping one corner open by a tent, or by the draliiage-tube.199 THE ANTISEPTIC METHOD. The Antiseptic Treatment of Wounds.—Allusion has already been made at p. 177 to the theory founded on Pasteur’s observations and experiments which attributes suppin-ation, in the majority of cases, to the putrefactive fermenta- tion set np in an animal fluid by the development in it of organisms caiTied into it as germs floating thi-ough the atmosphere, and not spontaneously developed in it by any change taking place in the tissues or fluids of the part independently of such impregnation. According to the “ Geim-Theory,” as applied to Avounds, it necessarily follows that, if the impreg-nating germs can be rigidly excluded from a woimd, all those suppin-ative actions that are dependent upon the implantation of new organisms on a raw smiace Avill be prevented. This may evidently be accomplished in tAVO ways ; either by completely excluding all air fr’om a AA'omid, and thus pre\’enting the intrusion of the gems earned by it; or else by destroying the gems floating in the air around the Avoimd by an antiseptic vapom, as of carbolic acid, and thus admitting to the siuface of the Avoimd absolutely pme air that has been entirely fr-eed fr’om all septic matters. It is important to bear these points in mind, and to recollect that in accordance Avith this theory the excliAsion of atmospheinc air from a Avound is by no means necessary • that it does not act injimously of itself, but simply as a A'ehicle of septic gems ; and that, if these be destroyed by chemical action or removed by filtration, and the air thus rendered siu’gicaUy pine, so far as organic or septic inter- mixtine is concerned, it may be fr’eely admitted. Taking this germ-theory as his starting-point. Lister has founded on it a plan of treatment in Avounds, as novel as it is scientifle and ingenious, which is knoAATi as the “ Antiseptic Method.” The j)rinciple on Avhich this treatment is founded consists in protecting the AA'ound in such a manner dmang the process of its healing, that no organic germs floating in the air are admitted to it. This principle is carried out in tAvo Avays—by covering the Avound Avith antiseptic dressings, and by smTomiding it Avith an antiseptic atmosphere—the activ’e agent for both jAiuposes being carbolic acid. It is claimed for this method that, when it has been thoroughly carried out. imion will take place even in extensive contused and lacerated womids, AAithout the fomation of a single drop of pus, and Avithout the occmrence of any general febrile reaction. The principle on AA'hich this method of treatment is founded, is, as is Avell knoAAUi, disputed by Pouchet, Charlton Bastian, and other scientifle men, AA'ho advocate the doctrine of spontaneous generation. It Avould be altogether foreign to the scope of this Avork to enter into this discussion ; and Avhether the geim-theoiy be coirect or not, matters perhaps little to the practical Surgeon, for there can be no doubt that the decomposition of fluids in Avounds, and the consequent suppuration, are greatly favoined by the admission of impure air ; and that any treatment Avhich has for its basis the exclusion of impm’e air and the prevention or aiTCst of decomposition of the animal fluids by an antiseptic body, such as carbolic acid, must be theoretically advantageous, and based on sound principles of practice. If the admission of air into a Avound Avere the sole cause of its suppiu-ation, A\diether that result be the consequences of the chemical constitution of the air, or of the introduction into t 0 wound through its mediiun vf organic particles that produce a fermentative dc ion in the fluid and tissues in Avhich they are deposited, there can be noINJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. 200 doubt that any method of treatment having for its ol)ject the exclusion of the air and tlie destruction of these organic particles ol^g■ht to prevent absolutely the formation of pns in the Avound. But, as we know that suppm-ation may take place in situations into Avhich no air has been admitted, we cannot look upon the atmosphere as being the sole occasioning cause of this action, howcA'er innch it may faA'Oiir it; and it must be referred in such cases to the influence of other agencies, amongst which certain morbid conditions of the blood, con- stitutional derangement of the patient and intensity of inflammation are amongst the more importipit and direct. It is undoubtedly these disturbing influences that prevent the complete success of the “ Antiseptic Method” in a certain number of cases. Theoretically it is perfect; in practice its success is not constant. It would be successful in all cases, were the healing of a woimd a pimely local act under the sole influence of local conditions of tissue and of treatment. But this is far from being the case. The repair of a ivomid is a process that is materially influenced for good or for caTI by the state of the patient’s constitution. When that is healthy and pure, the wound Avill readily heal under any favoimable local conditions, and imder none more readily than under the antiseptic method. When the blood is A'itiated and the constitution depraved, no mere local method of treatment can be trusted to as an infallible preA'entiA'e of local morbid action. But eA'en in such imfavourable cases as these, AA’here suppiu'ation and sloughing are rather the consequences of a bad constitutional than of a morbid local condition, the antiseptic method, by lessening the tendency to decomposition and to putrefactive or fermentatiA'e changes in the woimd, and by rapidly remoA'ing and destroying noxious materials and effluA'ia, AviU do more than any other plan of treatment to limit the morbid local action that results from the continued presence in and aroimd the Avoimd of septic matter, and to prevent those gi’ave constitutional sequences that inevitably result from its absorption into the system, and thus to avert the A'arious forms of blood-poisoning that are often occasioned by Avoimds in an unclean, suiipmating, or sloughy state. It must be remembered that the employment of antiseptics, has no effect on tAvo of the most important causes of suppuration in Avounds, viz., tension and the irritation of movement; and, moreoA'er, it may itself be a cause of suppu- ration if too concentrated an antiseptic be allowed for any length of time to remain in actual contact A\'ith the raw surface. A tight stitch may cause inflammation and suppuration as readily under antiseptic ch-essing as under any other mode of treatment. If free exit be not proA'ided for the necessary serous discharge Avhich flows from the smface of a AA'Ouud dining the first tAventy-four or thirty-six hom’S, its accumulation will give rise to tension, and suppination Avill certainly foUoAV, although the pus may be perfectly free from any odour of decomposition. Drainage of the Avoimd is, therefore, an essential part of the antiseptic treatment. Bough handling, unnecessary disturbance, or tlie unaA'oidablc movements due to the situation of some AVOunds, Avill also give rise to the formation of pns, AA'liatover mode of dressing be employed. As the “germ-theoiy” constitutes the basis of the antiseptic method.

A\'e have already (p. 104 et aeq.) discussed the principles on Avhich the anti- septic method is founded. The details have been most ingeniously varied from time to time by In'ster. Any one who understands the principles on which it is foimdcd can have no gveat difficulty in caiiying it out on the following plan, which more or less modified is in accordance with Lister’s most recent views on the subject. Arterial hamiorrhage, when present, is controlled by torsion or by tying the ^•essels with cai-bolised catgut ligatines. These are prepared by soaking fine catgut for some weeks in an emulsion foiined by adding one part of pime ca>rl}olic a>cid, delii^uesced by the addition of vater, to fi\e paits of olive-oil. The ligatiu-es arc cut off short, and allowed to remain in the wound to become absorbed by the siuToimdiug tissues. Oozing of blood is to be checked by cold carbolised water. Supposing the wound to be the result of accident, its whole extent, even to the most remote recesses, is to be thoroughly mopiied or syringed out with a wateiy solution of the acid. If the womid be in-egnlar this is best done by means of a syringe with a piece of soft India- rubber tubing on its nozzle. The tubing is stiff enough to penetrate any existing cavity in the woimd, but not so stiff as to force a Avay for itself. Care must be taken in injecting the wound, not to squeeze the bps together so as to get up high pressing in its cavity, or the cellular tissue in the neighboiu- hood may become injected with the solution of carbolic acid, and unpleasant inflammation may result. If the wound be fresh, the solution need not be stronger than 1 to 40, but if some hours have passed it is safer to use a solu- tion of 1 in 20. The whole of the parts which Avill be covered by the dressing should be Avell washed Avith a solution of 1 in 20. If the womid be on the hand or foot, great care must be taken to clean the nails and betw’een the digits. If on the head, the hair must be cut, and here it is safer to oil Aihat remains Avith carbolised oil, 1 to 10. Any sutures that may be required should lie metallic, or of siUt tAAist steeped in becsAvax melted with one- tenth of carbolic acid, the needle and tlmead being passed through a watery solution of carbolic acid (1 to 40) before being used. The dressing from the time the injection is finished should be conducted luider a spray of carbolic acid and water (1 to 40). By means of the spray of 1 to 40 carbobc acid solution, throAAui by an amnsthetic spray-apparatus or some modification of it, the Avoimd is sniroiuided by a carbolised atmosphere in which none of the solid particles AAhich cause decomposition can retain their activity; in other AAords, no germs can hh^c. If the Avound be very large so that the cloud of spray from one apparatus does not completely coA'er it, tAvo must be used. If fr’om^any reason the spray should cease, the Avound must be covered Avith a guard consisting of a piece of linen rag free from holes, soaked in carbolic acid and water (1 to 40), Avhich should bo in constant readiness during any dressing or operation. In Avounds produced by operations, the syi’inging and mopping out Avith carbolised AA’ater is unnecessary, as the aaIioIo operation is performed under the spray. All the instruments should be put in a basin of cai olic acid and water (1 to 40), and taken out as required, and put back again ey are likely to be Avantod a second time during the operation.

After an operation, the meshes of the sponges always are more or less filled with coagulated fibrine, which no Avashing Avill get out. To clean sponges thoroughly, Lister recommends that they should be put in a basin of simple Avater for some days, till the decomposing fibrine emits a poAverfnl smell ; then Avashed thoroughly Avith Avater, and put to soak in a bath of 1 to 20 solution of carbolic acid. Before beginning the operation, the Siu-geonmust thoroughly soak his hands in a 1 to 40 solution of carbolic acid ; and aaLcii practicable, it is advisable to i keep a rag soaked in the same lotion applied, for some hours before the opera- tion, to the area aftemards to be covered by the dressing. In aU cases, the Avhole of the part to be operated on must be carefully washed with 1 in 20 solution before commencing the performance. If old sinuses be implicated in the operation-Avomid, they must be injected A\nth chloride of zinc (40 gi\ to an ounce) after the operation, and the whole wound Avashed out Avith cai’bohc acid lotion. If the sinuses be nmnerous it is, perhaps, safer to wash the whole wound out Avith chloride of zinc lotion, the good effects of AA'hich were pointed out by Campbell De Morgan many years ago. Sinuses should not be injected before the operation, as there is some danger of ruptimiug their Avails, and if the chloride of zinc lotion should thus become injected into the cellular tissue, the most extensiv'e and dangerous sloughing may result. In all cases of AAmimd, AA'hether residting from accident or operation, di’ainage fonns an essential part of the antiseptic system of treatment. The inltation of the antiseptic, applied to the raAV sm’face, increases considerably the flow of the natural serous discharge dmlng the first twenty-four or thirty-six hoiu’s. There ai'e no hgatm-es to form a drain for it, and the edges of the woimd are rather firmly pressed together by the dressing. It is necessary, therefore, to provide for the exit of the discharge by means of India-rubber drainage tubes. One or more must be inserted to the very bottom of the Avound, and the edges of the skin may then be brought together as closely as possible, a continuous sutiu'e CA'en being used if the Siu’geon prefer it. The tubes must be rendered antiseptic, by being kept for about tAA'enty-four hoiu’s in a 1 to 20 solution of the acid. They should be cut off level Avith the siu'face, and to prevent them from slipping into the AA'Ound, a cai’bolised silk thread should be attached to their superficial ends. The tubes must vary in size and number Avith the extent and nature of the woimd, and must be brought to the surface at the most coiwenient and dependent parts. It must be remembered that these tubes, ,j being usually made of vulcanised India-rubber, contain a considerable cunount 'j of sulphm'. They aaiU, therefore, often impart a peculiar smell to the dischai’ge, . and blacken silver stitches or plaster in their neighbourhood, and so falsely > suggest that decomposition has taken place. The drainage-tubes should not be moved for the first tAVO days, by AAdiich time they AA'ill have formed a track for themselves, and can be readily re-introduced if necessary. Sometimes they can be completely remoA'ed on the third day ; but usually it is safer merely to | shorten them by cutting off a piece at each di'cssing till they become reduced to about half an inch in length. In aU cases, it is better from the beginning to protect the raAV surface ancTHE ANTISEPTIC METHOD. 203 edges of the wound as far as possible from any direct contact with the carl)ohc uckl in the ch-essings, Avhich Avonld infallibly cause sufficient irritation to produce suppuration. The small quantity of carbolic acid left m the Avound Avhen it is closed, is so temporary in its action as scarcely to require considera- tion. It is partly washed away by the serous discharge and partly absorbed, so that probably in a few hours, or perhaps less, the deep parts of the wound are free fr-om any trace of the acid. To protect the raAV surface, the Avound is covered Avith so-caUed “ protective.” This is simply a piece of thick green oiled silk brushed over Avith one part of dextrine to two of powdered stai'ch in IG of cold Avater solution of carbolic acid, and allowed to dry. Before being- applied, it is dipped in a solution of carbolic acid (1 to 40). It is in itself jx;rfectly uniiritating, and is almost imperv’ious to carbolic acid, so that, as soon as the small quantity of the acid adhering to its under siuface has been absoi’bed by the skin or granulations beneath, the AA’ound is almost absolutely excluded from any direct action of the iiritating antiseptic. The protecti\'e should extend about one inch on each side of the wound, and over this should be jjlaced a single layer of the “ antiseptic gauze,” which has been dipped in the 1 to 40 solution, and squeezed as dry as possible. If much discharge is to be expected, tAvo or three layers of wet gauze may be employed. Over this, and extending at least six inches on every side of the Avoimd, is placed a dressing of dry antiseptic gauze, folded eight layers thick. If it be impossible to make it extend far enough round the Avomid, the number of layers must be increased. Between the tAvo most superficial layers is placed a piece of thin Mackintosh cloth, so that the discharge may not soak through at one spot and decompose, but may be evenly diflfrised over the whole dressing. The cloth should be dipped in the 1 to 40 solution before being used. Over aU is placed a bandage composed of antiseptic gauze, seciu-ed at several points by pins. Oare must be taken not to pmictiu’e the Mackintosh cloth AAuth the pins. The spray must not cease for a moment till the woimd is seciu-ely covered Avith the dressing, and care must be taken to direct the spray actually on the AVOund, and not, as may happen, merely on the back of the gauze as it is being ,applied. In changing the dressing, the same rules must be obseiwed, and the womid noA'cr for an instant exposed to A'iew except under a spray of carbolic acid and Avater. "While preparing the neAV di'essings, to save the trouble of working the spray, the Avound should be covered A\ith a “ guard,” as aboA'e described. I he same piece of Mackintosh cloth may be used aU through the case, if it be washed at eA'ery dressing in carbolic acid and water. It should be examined CAery time to see that the Avaterproof layer has not peeled off) and that it is free fr’om pin-holes. The di’essing must be repeated at fii’st eA'ery day, till the serous discharge has ceased, and then eA'ery second, third, or foiu-th day, according to the amount of discharge. If it be thought necessai’y to apply stiapping to the wound, it may be done under the spray, by dipping the plaster in a one part of carbolic acid and Avater (1 to 20), to Avhich is added an equal quantity of boiling water. Although attention to detail is of gi'cat importmice, ® m description the dressing may seem complicated and tedious, its applica- lon to a wound such as that of an amputation, does not take more than fiA'c washing, syi-inging, and examining ligatures, &c., are saved, ot more troublesome than the ordinary mode of treatment.204 IJS'JURIES OF SOFT PARTS. Altliougli the abo'S'e described plan is always to l^e followed when tlio ueccssary materials and appliances are at hand, it must not bo supposed that in their absence antiseptic treatment is impossible. It may be conducted as follows. The bleeding having been an-ested by torsion, and the wound syringed out as above described, and the sutimes put in, the nozzle of the syringe is to be introduced between the sutm-es, and the wound carefully \vashed out once more ttrough the drainage tubes and immediately coA'ered \vith a “ guard.” A large piece of lint soaked in carbolic acid and olive-oil (1 to 10) is then applied, extending some distance beyond the womid in every direction. The guard may then be withdraum from beneath the lint Avithout again exposing the wound. This dressing requires changing more frequently than the gauze, and is not so certain in its action. In di’essing the wound, a stream of carbolic acid (1 to 40) may be run OA'er it from a sponge, AA'hen it is unavoidably exposed Avithout a guard. If no drainage-tube be at hand, its place may be taken by a slip of hnt soaked in the carbohsed oil. A AveU made pad of carded oakimi is in every Avay as efficient as the antiseptic gauze, as far as its poAver of preA'euting decomposition is concerned. It should be covered Arith oiled silk or gutta-percha tissue to prevent the discharge from soaking through at one spot. The chief objections to the oakum are, the difficidty of making a imiform smooth pad from it, and the blackening and occasional irritation of the skin fr’onr the tar. The iiTitation is best prevented by smearing the skirr Arith olive oil arrd carbolic acid (1 to 10). Druirrg the last feAV years salicylic acid (a derivative of carbolic acid) has been used extensively irr Germany, especially by Thiersch, as a srrbstitrrte for carbolic acid. Its arrtiseptic powers are stated to be greater, it is fr'ee from odoru, has a faint SAveetish taste, arrd is rrot A'olatile, Thiersch uses it as a spray irr the propor- tiorr of 1 to 300, arrd states that its action is equal to the carbolic spray. If so, as the acid is not A'olatile, the spray carr orrly act by SAA'eeping the air and collectirrg the drrst orr the particles of the flrrid, arrd by coverirrg the wormd Avith a thirr layer of the acid solutiorr. In slorrghy wormds the acid is powdered OA'er the srrrface, either prue or mixed AAuth starch. In dr-essirrg fresh wormds, Thiersch uses cotton-wool moistened A\dth a correentrated solution of the acid arrd afterwards dried, or a dressirrg constantly inigated A\ith the solrrtiorr (1 to 300). Those who belicA'e in the power of the vapour of carbohe acid to preverrt decomposition, consider the rron-volatility of salicylic acid a great dr-awback to its use. Experierree has showrr that it is rrot less irritatiirg ; so that, except irr cases irr Avhich the smell is rmbearable to the patient, it presents ferv, if any, real adA'antages over carbolic acid. For dr’essirrg srrperficial Avormds, Lister has for some years jrast made rrse of boracic acid. The antiseptic poAA'ers of this acid are not equal either to carbohe or salicylic acids, but it is proportionately less irritating when irr direct corrtact A\ath the skirr or arr ulcer. In rrsirrg it, the raAV smTaco should be Avashed AA'ith a satruated solrrtiorr ot the acid arrd covered AAith a piece of “ protectiA'e,” preA'iorrsly dipped irr the same solrrtiorr. Over this arc placed Iaa^o or thr'ee layers ot Avet boracic lint, AA'hich are seemed Avith a common bandage arrd loft to dry. The boracic lirrt is prepared by dippiirg conrrrron lint in a satruated boiling solrrtiorr of the acid and allowing it to dry. It AA’ill then be forrrrd to be irnpregirated AAotlr theDISCHARGES FROM ^YOTJNI)S. 205 TDCcnliar soft ciystals of horacic acid. If decomposition be present on tlic Lrface of the womid or ulcer, the sore should be first washed with a strong- solution of chloride of zinc or of carbolic acid, the boracic solution not beini-- sufficiently powerful for the purpose. As boracic acid is to be used only when the wound has become a superficial sore the use of the spray is unnecessary. ‘Another Taluable preparation is the boracic acid ointment, composed of one pai-t of boracic acid to one of white wax, two of paraffin, and two of almond oil. It requires to be wanned and then spread upon a piece of fine linen rag. It has no tendency to adhere to the surface of the sore, and allows the discharge to ooze out from beneath it at the edges of the di-essing, at the same time pre- Tenting its decomposition. The preparations of boracic acid are especially nseftd when the operation of skin-grafting is employed. Each little gnaft may be dipped in the solution of boracic acid without any fear of destroying its vitality, and the freedom from decomposition ensmed by the dressing gTeatly increases the certainty of the operation. But it is not only by the employment of antiseptics that the decomposition of the secretions in a woimd may be prevented. Means for securing the free exit of the secretions are ahnost equally serviceable. The decomposition of the fluids in wounds—of the effused blood and liquor sanguinis, and of that sanies which is always poured out more or less abmidantly fi-om cut surfaces, may be prevented by affording it facilities of escape, or by washing it away as rapidly as it forms. It is in this way that septic con- tamination of wounds is often prevented, although no antiseptics are used. On this principle is conducted the “ open air treatment ” of wounds, strongly recommended and successfully practised by Humphiy, in which, though air is freely admitted, the ill effects of pent-up decomposing secretions are obviated. The treatment of wounds by constant irrigation, or by the tepid bath, is often very successful for the same reason. The older Simgeons seemed free discharges by open dressings, with stimulating balsams, tiuctmes, and ointments, which, however, were partly antiseptic ; or by the use of tents and plugs introduced into the angles and depending parts of wounds, whence they were periodicaUy removed, in order to give exit to the retained discharges. A favourite method of dressing woimds in the pre-anaesthetic period con- sisted in leaving the cavity open and freely exposed to the air until all oozing of blood had ceased and the surfaces were “ glazed,” i. e., covered with a layer of fibriue. They were then brought together, the discharges draining away along the ligature threads, which were brought out at the lowest part and the edges covered -with water-dressing. In this way ready union, with little if any suppuration, was often seem-ed ; and I have Avitnessed and obtained as good results by this as by any other plan of treatment. With the introduction of anaesthetics this practice Avas changed, and in order to save the pain of a second dressing, the Avound, if a smgical one, as in an amputation, Avas “ put up ” at once before the patient Avas removed fi-om the C)perating taldc—before all oozing had ceased, and before the process of “ glazing ” had commenced. This practice led to most pernicious results, for no pro-vision having been made for the escape of sanies, this, often mixed Avitb blood-clot, the result of oozing, became retained in the Avonnd ; these decom- posed, and thus became the fertile source of profuse suppuration, sloughing.2o6 INJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. putrescence, and pyfemia. The intivjduction of the drainage-tube Ijy Chas- saignac into surgical practice, and its adoption hy many Siu’geons in this- country, as an adjunct to the ordinary dressings of operation-Avounds, led to great improvements in the results of operations ; for hy affording a ready exit and apertiu’e of discharge for the sanies, Avhich would otherwise have been pent up, its decomposition was prevented, and all the consequent evils averted*. The drainage-tube is, as has been seen, an essential part of the “ antiseptic | method;” and its use should never he omitted, whether that treatment be adopted or not, for by it alone can the manifold evils of decomposing pent-up secretions be prevented. Inflammation of Incised Wounds.—If union by the fii’st intention fail fi-om any local or constitutional cause, inflammation takes place in and aroiuid the- wound ; the lips swell and become red ; a sero-sauguinolent discharge, gradually assuming a puriform character, exudes ; and at the same time a general febrile state sets in, attended with rise of the pulse and temperatiu-e, heat of skin, thirst, etc., which continues until suppuration is fairly established. The thermometer will always give thnely warning of the approach of this “ primary traiunatic fever ” by indicating a rise of 2° or 3° Fahr. The use of this instrument in siu’gical practice is attended with great advantage, as it is often the fii’st to mdicate the onset of some of the more serious sequelas of womids and injiu’ies. In these circmnstauces, the sutures should be immediately removed ; the strips of plaster, if their use be continued, should be used for support only, and not for union ; a thick piece of warm-water dressing shoidd be apphed, and the general condition of the patient aijpropriately treated. When granidations have sprmig up, and suppuration has fairly set in, the treatment must be con- ducted in accordance -with those general principles that guide us in the management of ulcerated surfaces Q)p. 166 eif sec[.). The suppuration must be moderated, the process of cicatrisation facilitated by the apiDlication of a bandage, the general health attended to, and the strength of the patient sup- ported. With the vicAV of stimulating the granidations to cicatrise, and to check the formation of pus, the carbolised water dressmg may be replaced by lotions of sulphate of zinc (two grains to the omice), sulphocarbolate of zinc (three or four gTains to the ounce), lime-water, etc. If any tendency to idcera- tion or formation of sloughs be met ivith, a wash of nitric acid and opium (extracti opii gr. v., acidi mtrici dil. m. x. to the ounce), or lotions of iodine, sulphite of potash, or chloride of zinc, of requisite strength ; in the latter case, the deeper parts of the Avouud should be well syringed out irith the lotion. ■VNTien the granulations are high, pale, and flabby, they shoidd be rubbed doivn Avith sulphate of copper, or touched freely Avith solid nitrate of silver. An intercuiTent attack of traumatic inflammation Avill at once put a stop to ; the process of luiioii; the parts around become swollen, hot, and painful, the formation of pus ceases, the wound is dry and augry-looking, and portions of it ah'eady healed open up once more. Hot fomentations or warm emollient iioidtices should be applied until siippinatiou is re-established, when they may ))C replaced by cooling lotions and cold compresses ; Avhen all signs ol inflam- mation have passed, the granulating surfaces may be again brought together by sutures, plasters, and bandages, Avith a view of their muting by “ secondary adhesion.” On the other hand, should the iiiflauimatioii rmi on to gangrene.CONTUSED AND LACERATED WOUNDS. 207 the separation of the sloughs must be accelerated l)j poultices, whilst the powers of the patient are sustained by liberal diet, with the free administration of stimulants. Putrefaction and foetor must be combated by the use of lotions containing carbolic acid or some other antiseptic. In very se^•ere cases of traumatic inflammation, especially in wounds impli- cating the joints, compression or ligature of the main trunk leading to the seat of injury has been practised, wth the object of limiting the quantity of blood in the tissues, and regulating the circulation through them, so that the processes of repair can be more rapidly entered on. For further remarks on this subject, the reader is referred to page 130. Paxilty Cicatrices may give rise to much disfigiu’ement from excessive or irregular contraction ; and various plastic operations, which will be described more fully hereafter, are recorded to remedy this inconvenience. Much benefit will occasionally result from excising the cicatrix, and then bringing together the opposite edges of the wound in an uniform smooth line. Should it be too large for this, if flat, it must be less; if angular, as the flexure of a joint, it may be divided doAvn to the sound structiu'es beneath, aud the gap thus left filled by a Haj) of integument dissected fi-om the neighbouring parts and tmsted into it. Again, in certain situations on the tiauik, cicatrices 'will yield before the pressure of the viscera aud thus give rise to herniEe. In some cases they remain weak, thiu, and .tender for a considerable period, nuth constant tendency to break domi ; these conditions of cicatrices are generally due to constitutional causes. They may also become painful, or be the seat of pigmentary deposits. In other rare instances they undergo a species of hypertrophy of a non-malignant character, chiefly met with after bums, which is called spurious or AUherfs Moid, to distinguish it from true keloid, that does not attack scars. This con- dition may call for surgical interference, but it often disappears spontaneously. CONTUSED AND LACERATED WOUNDS. These may be defined to be wounds that are attended by more or less bruising aljout the edges and sides; presenting every possible variety in the degree of contusion and of Avoimd, from a cut on the shin to the crushing and laceration of a limb by a cannon-shot. They are commonly inflicted by blimt cutting instraments, as by a hatchet, or by stones, bludgeons, etc. Lacerations by machinery, in which parts are tom oif or crushed, the bites aud gorings of animals, and gun-shot injuries of all kinds, come luidcr this denomination. Characters.—I^Tiatever their mode of infliction, these Avomids present certain characters in common, by Avhich they differ from all other injuries. Their lips are in’cgular and torn, less gaping than incised Avounds, but surrounded by more or less ecchymosis and contusion, AAnth a tendency to slough at their sides, ihcre is usually but little haemoiThage, and the lAain is of an aching or dull character. In consequence of the sloughy state of the lips and sides, these Avoimds almost ahvays imite by the second intention. Contused and lacerated Avounds present peculiarities according to the mode of their infliction. hejv they arc occasioned by the l)ite of a large auimal, the part injured l)ccomc8 very painful, and inflames extcnsiA'ely ; the Avound being lacerated, much contused, aud often penetrating deeply. It sloughs in consequence ofI 2o8 INJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. the pressure to which it has hoeii suhjocted, and of the shakino' and tearing of the pait by the animal. l\Hien inflicted by the tusk or horn of an animal, the wound is extcnsiyely lacerated rather than contused, and often partakes of the nature of a punctiued wound. j When a part of the body is torn ott', the wound presents peculiar characters ; which differ, however, accordino; as the separation is effected at the part struck or seized, or at a distance from it. Tn the first case—as when a cannon-ball carries off a limb, or an arm is ■caught in a steam-mill or rag-tearing machine and crushed or tom off—the stump presents a very ragged surface, the skin being stripped away higher than the other parts, the tendons hanging out, and the bellies of the muscles that are tom across beiirg swollen, protruding, and apparently constricted by the lacerated integument. A most important condition in such wounds is the state of the vessels ; these arc separated lower down than the other parts, for, being elastic, they elongate and pull out before they give way. There is no hfemoiThage, because the inner and middle coats of the artery, breaking off short, retract and contract to a small aperture, and allow the external coat to be dragged down and twisted over its mouth, in such a way as to offer a complete ban-ier to the escape of blood. The lione is crushed off at the end of the stimap, of which it forms the irregular conical apex, and is often split up to the next joint above. Occasionally, when parts are pulled off, they are separated at a distance fr’om the point seized. Thus, fingers that have been torn off by machinery have their extensor tendons separated higher up, at their junction noth the belly of the muscle, and not at the part seized ; the tendon being drawn out of its sheath, and hanging on to the separated end in a ribbon-like manner. Tn railway accidents, when a train has passed O’^cr a limb -without completely separating it, the muscles may be found detached from their origins. Progress.—In the progress of a contused or lacerated wound there are two distinct periods : 1, that of the Separation of the Slough produced by the con- tusion ; 2, that of Eepair by (Iranulations of the chasm left. These processes are analogous to those which occur in ulceration, and are described at pages 1G2 and 108. The Extent of the Slough depends not only upon the extent and severity, but also upon the situation of the injury. Tf the parts around the wound be much bruised, then superficial sloughing to a great extent may occur ; if the woimd be deep though not extensive, there wiU always be danger of troublesome slonofring, leading to deep suppmation and biuro-wing of matter, and in some nases to secondary h£emorrhage. Those wounds that are situated immediately ■ over bony points—as the shin and elbow—are especially tedious, as the slough ' fr'oc^nently implicates the fasciae. I he scalp has a less tendency to slough than tiny other part of the cutaneous surface. This is o-wnng to its gi-eat vascularity, and to the large supply of blood Avhich it receiA'cs from closely subjacent arteries. Tn all cases of*^contused and lacerated wounds—more especially iu those of the scal|-)—there is great danger of the supervention of erysipelas. But the chief danger to be apprehended in Avonnds of this description is the supervention of Traumatic Gangrene, Avln’ch may occur in three vajs. 1. Tlie contusion always kills a thin layer of tissue, Avliich forms a slough on the sides or lips of the Avound ; but in some cases the A'iolcnco done to the pait209 TRAUMATIC GANGRENE. is so cri’cat as directly to kill its whole substance. Thus, if a limb be crushed to a pulp by machinery, or by the passage of a hea\y waggon over it, all circu- lation is completely and at once an-ested, the vitality of the part is destroyed outright, and it Avill speedily fall into a state of putrefacti-^'e decomposition, with all the usual signs of advanced mortification. If the violence be not quite so gi’eat as this, the vitality of the part may be lessened and its resisting power diminished to such an extent, that the inflammation necessary for the repair of the injury terminates in gangrene. This is a local traumatic mortification, evincing no disposition to siu’ead beyond the part injured, but being bounded by a line of demarcation along which it 'will sepai’ate. It is not always easy to distinguish this direct form of gangrene fi-om such discoloration and disorgani- sation of a limb as are still compatible Avith life. In all cases of doubt the Surgeon must Avait, and a very short time—a few hours—aauU be sufiicient to declare whether the vitality of the part can be maintained or not. In cases of much doubt an incision might be made into the part, and the true state of things thus ascertained : but tliis should not be done if it can possibly be avoided. •2. The injiuy may be chiefly inflicted upon the great A'essels of the limb, damaging them to such an extent as to intemipt comjAletely the circulation ; gangi-ene being thus induced indirectly in the parts supplied by them. This form of gangrene we shall haA^e occasion to treat of folly when speaking of Injuries of the Ai’teries. 3. The true traiunatic or “ spreading gangrene,” the most fatal variety of mortification, is most commonly the result of seA'ere contused and lacerated Avoimds, particularly Avhen complicated Arith fractures. It has a tendency to spread rapidly, especially thi’ough the areolar planes of the limb, often involA’ing the AA'hole member in less than twelve hoims after its invasion. The true Spreading Traumatic Gangrene is invariably of the dark and humid kind. In it, death of the tissues and their putrefaction are contempo- raneous. The putrefactive process does not take place in this, as in the other A aneties of gangrene just described, some hoiu’s, or days even, after the cessation of vitality in the pai’t; but the piu'plish-black coloiu’, the foetid odoiu’, and the development of gas, occur at the moment of the death of the tissues, and ai’e CArdently dependent on some peculiar septic condition of the parts attacked by the disease. It differs from the other varieties of gangrene in having no dis- position to limit itself by a line of demarcation, as Avell as in the rapidity of its extension and the speedy putrescence that occurs in the part attacked. The Causes of this form of traumatic gangrene ai’e local and constitutional com lined, The, Local Causes consist of injuries, more particularly contused anc aceiatcd Avounds of the hand or foot. As a general rule it may, perhaps, )e statec tha,t the more seA'ere forms of injury of this description, more especially such as implicate joints or bones, are more liable to be folloAved by this form of f,angicne ; but it AA'ould be an error to srrppose that severe injury is a rrecessary precursor of it.

I.210 INJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. Ihe Conalituttonal Condition of the patient is imdouljtedly the main cause of the snpen’cntion of spreading tranmatic gangrene. However severe an injiuy may be, and liowcver certainly it may kill those tissues or those parts of limbs which are directly and immediately exposed to the operation of the external violence, the rapidly spreading foimi of the disease will not supervene unless the constitution be in an unsoimd state ; and this rcmai’k applies necessarily with especial force to its occiuTence after the slighter forms of injury. The supervention of spreading traumatic gangTene will occur in circimistances similar to those which dispose to pyaemia, erysipelas, or sloughing phagedfcna; and, in fact, to the low and difPusc inflammations generally. They consist of imperfect and faidty hygienic conditions, and an impme state of the blood, arising either from long-continued exposure, antecedent to the injiuy, to such conditions, or from chronic disease of the eliminatory organs, more particularly of the kidneys. Defective depuration of the blood, consequent on chronic kidney-disease, is a most fertile cause of this as of the other fomis of gangrene. Indeed, I beheve that the true siueading traumatic gangTene caimot occiu unless the blood be, previoushj to the receipt of the injury, in a depraved and disordered state, the result of the conditions, singly or combmed, above men- tioned. Hospital miasmata, and exposure to faulty hygienic conditions after the receipt of the injiuy, do not appear to me to exercise so marked an influence on the occiurence of this form of gangrene as of the low inflammatoiy diseases of the erysipelatous ty^ie. In fact, the patient is rarely, if ever, exposed to these influences sufficiently long after the occiUTence of the injiuy for them to have much effect on his constitutional condition, had that been in a somid state previously. Spreading traumatic gangrene occius only in recent wounds, and usually manifests itself within the first three days after their occiuTonce, whilst they are stiU in their first stage, and before suppuration has set in. ^Tien once this has occurred, and especially if the ivoiuid be gTanulating, the patient may get erysipelas, or pyiemia, or sloughing phagedama ; but he ndU no longer be susceptible of the spreading form of traumatic gangTene. I cannot, therefore, but look upon this formidable disease as a tndy constitutional affection, depend- ing more upon the state of the patient’s blood at the time of the reception of the injiuy, than upon the severity of that injury, or upon the circumstances to which he has been ex^Dosed immediately after the receipt of it. The S[/mj)ioms are as foUow. The woiuided limb at the seat of injiuy swells, becomes dusky, red, and has a deep-seated, tensive, binning pain. The- swelling, redness, and tension spread upwards, and are speedily followed by a dusky pui-plish tint, by a soft doughy feeling of the parts, and in the course of a few more hoius by a deep blackish-pinqile discoloration, which spreads ‘ uniformly and with great rapidity through all the tissues affected. This is accompanied or immediately followed by emphysematous crackling, due to the presence of gases which are developed by the decomposition of the parts attacked by the gangrene. The changes, which arc of a piitrcfacti'S'e natiuc, first develop themselves in the wound itself, and speedily extend from it to the smToiinding jiarts. That portion of the limb which is below the gangrened part becomes pale, cold, and oedematous. The portion which is above becomes rapidly infiltrated by serous exudation, which runs up the inner side of the limb to the axilla or groin, as the case may be. The part immediately above2II TREATMENT OF CONTUSED WOUNDS. the limit of the tissues that are actually mortified is greatly swollen by cedema- tous infiltration, tense and pitting slightly on pressm-e, usually mottled in colour of shades of gi-eenish or greyish yellow, like a bruise that is passing off. This oedema and peculiar discoloration extend higher along the iimcr side of the limb, where it ahvays first reaches the trimk. Emphysematous crackling rapidly spreads itself along the same parts, and the gangrene here travels with gi-eat rapidity, hopelessly involving the tissues and entering into the areolar planes of the axilla or groin in a very few hours. As the gangrene advances, the parts affected fall into a soft, pulpy, black mass. On making an incision into the parts so affected, it wU be found that the gangrenous disorganisation is primarily seated in the areolar planes of the limb, and that the muscles are not affected in the first instance. It vrU also be observed that the disease extends itself through the areolar tissue, the skin falling secondarily into slough. The constitutional symptoms are throughout of the loAvest ataxic type ; and death almost invariably ensues in three or fom’ days after the invasion of the disease, and always very shortly after the gangrene has reached the trank. Treatment of Contused and Lacerated Wounds.—In the treatment of the slighter form of these hijirries, we must bear in mind the occurrence of the two distinct periods: 1, that of sloughing; and 2, that of granulation. There is also in all injiules of this description a special tendency to the occmrence of eiysipelas and allied diseases. Care must be taken to clean the parts thoroughly from foreign bodies that are fr-equently impacted or ground into them. However contused and tora a flap of skin may be, it should, as a general rule, never be separated, provided it maintain any attachment to the neighboiuing tissues, but should always be re- placed on the chance of its vitahty being preserved. If it live, as it will often do, especially about the scalp, imder apparently the most discoiuaging circum- stances, much will be gained ; if it slough, no harm can result from the attempt to preserve it. There are even cases on record in which parts that have been completely separated have become attached, by being immediately reapphed to the surface from which they had been torn. IVhether this be actirally the case or not, it is at all cAcnts certain that a very small tongue of skhi is sufficient to maintain^ the vitality of a part. This we see exemplified in the operation for the restoration of a lost nose ; and cases have occiured to me in which the nose, nearly cut off, being only retained by a portion of one ala, has readily united on being replaced ; so hkevise, in bad cases of compound dislocation of t e fingers, the part has been saved, though merely attached by a narrow bridge ot skin. After a part has been replaced in this way, it should be retained fri situ by a few points of inteiruptcd suture, with a piece of lint soaked in collo- dion apifiicd to the line of wound. The sutiues must be left in for a somewhat onpr time than usual, until good union has resulted. The hfemon'hao-o as e ore mentioned, is as a rule easily controlled ; position, application of*^cold an the subsccpient bandaging being sufficient in the majority of cases. IWiei/ owe^er, the blood is bright-coloured and continues to drip fr-om the wound^ a \essel of some size has been divided : this should bo searched for, and the opening closed by torsion or ligature. In ordinaiy cases of contused or lacerated wounds, whether superficially P 2INJURIES OF SOFT FARTS. 2 12 extensive oi* deep, we must facilitate the separation of the sloughs by the appli- cation of -warmth and moistimo, which also serve to subdue local inflammation. Carded oakum, moistened in hot water find covered w'th oiled silk, answers this piu'pose better than poultices : it is cleaner and more readily applied, soaks up the discharges, and is to a certain extent antiseptic. Dismfecfants should be freely used in all contused and lacerated wounds. The wounds must be washed, syringed, or sprayed out several times a day -noth A\-eak solutions of the chlorides, of the permanganates, or of carbolic acid. In this wey sloughs and decomposing pus may be removed, and the tendency to local inflammation of an erysipelatous character, and the development of pyrnmia, averted. There is no more fertile cause of these disastrous effects than the retention of foetid decomposing pus in the areolar tissue of a contused wound. It is in this class of wounds that the antiseptic treatment has met with its greatest success. Under its use, iniion has taken place in very extensive injuries, loss of substance being replaced by granulations ; the crushed and tom tissues, which would othervuse have probably sloughed off, appearing to become re-vitalised : and all this has occurred without any general febrile distin-bance, and with the loss of but a small quantity of serous fluid in the shape of discharge. But, valuable as the antiseptic treatment incontestably is in many of these cases, it may occasionally fail in preventing suppuration. Should this happen, all plasters and tight and obstructive dressings must at once be removed, so as to allow a fr-ee exit of the discharges fr-om the wound. If this precaution be neglected, the most disastrous consequences, local and con- stitutional, will ensue fr’om the retention and infiltration of the pus and decomposing material in the textime of the limb or part. About the period at which the slough begins to be loosened, there is danger of the occuiTence of haemorrhage, if a large artery have been implicated in the injiuy. T\Tien haemorrhage occurs in this way, it usually sets in fr’om the sixth to the twelfth day, and may be speedily fatal; its treatment Anil be the same as that to be hereafter described for secondary haemoiThage after ligatmc of an artery in its continuity. After the sloughs haA'e separated, an ulcer is left, which must be treated on general principles. Amputation.—In the more severe cases of contused or lacerated womids, any attempt at saving the part may be hopeless, and the patient’s only chance lies in amiMtation. In determining the expediency of operation, two questions present themselves : 1, the natme of the cases in which amputation should be performed ; and, 2, the time at w'hich it should be done, whether immediately after the infliction of the injiuy, or subsequently. It is difficult to lay down more than very general rules as to the hind of cases that require amputation; much depending on the age, constitution, and pre-vious habits of the patient. In all cases the Siu-geon should be careful not to condemn a limb that admits of a fair chance of being saved ; and, if the patient should happen to die, as he often may, fr'om the after-effects, such as erysipelas or phlebitis, of a contused Avound that admitted a lair jii’ospcct of recovery, the Smgeon may justly console himself Avith the reflection that, Avith the constitutional disposition leading to these diseases, the injury inflicted by the amputation Avould in all probability have been equally fatal, and that thus the patient has been saved the pain of an operation that would haA'c been unsuccessfrrl in its result. iAMPUTATION FOP CONTUSED WOUNDS. 213 As a general rule, severe injuries are more readily recovered from in the young than in the old, their vitality and elasticity of constitution being gi’catcr, with less tendency to consecutive diseases. Much udll depend upon the habits of the patient, or upon the existence of visceral disease at the time of the injury. In persons who have been fr’ce livers, and who have that pecuhar irritability of system conjoined with deficient power commonly observed in such subjects, and more especially if there be aheady existing disease of the liver or kidneys, contused and lacerated wounds are apt to be followed by the womt foiTus of erysipelas and traumatic gangrene, and thus to be speedily fatal, lujiu’ies of the upper extremity are less serious than those of the lower ; its supply of blood being proportionately greater and more uniformly distributed. In some badly contused wounds, also, of the arm and hand, as in bad lacera- tions with fractiu’o about the shoulder, elbow, or metacaip)us, resection of the iujiued part may be perfoimed instead of amputation of the limb. Though there may always be this doubt as to the cases that should not be amputated, there are certain conditions in which the Siugeon need never hesitate to perform this operation, as the only chance of saving the patient’s life. The folio-wing are the cases of severe contusion and laceration in which the limb should be amputated ; either with the view of preventing the occiu- renee of gangrene, or in order to remove a mortified part from the body, and thus to save the life of the patient at the expense of the injured hmb. 1. If a limb have been torn off by machinery, carried away by a cannon-ball, or cut off by the passage of a railway-train over it, the irregular and conical stump should be amputated, so as to leave a more useful and healthy one to the patient. 2. If the whole thickness of a limb—the soft parts and the bones—^l^e thoroughly disorganised and crushed, it must be removed. o. If the soft parts be extensively stripped away fr’om the bones, though these be entire, so much sloughing and suppuration wiU ensue as to leave a useless limb, and amputation should be performed. It is in these cases that it is often especially difficult to estimate the amoimt of injury that cannot be lecmeied from, this depending much upon the age and constitution of the su erer. I believe that Siu’geons, in their anxiety to save a limb, often lose a patient undei these circumstances. I have more than once had reason to regret ^ a-ving attempted to save limbs injured in this way ; and believe that, if e 8 111 of the lower exti’emity be extensively tom down and the museles muc 1 acerated, so as to slough away, there is but little chance for the patient— nn ess e be 1 ery young, and of a remarkably sound constitution—except in ampu ation. In the upper extremity it is different; there, recovery may take place imder the most adverse circumstances. d. So also, if the knee be largely opened, with laceration of the soft pai'ts an per laps fra,ctiu'e of the contiguous bones, tlie limb must be amputated. n.lrrnT^i^ injuries of the ankle, shoidder, and elbow joints, may, as has r -n stated, admit of resection rather than of amputation. heupp have a great tendency to run into gangrene, and rS3" "-7 extensive inju- ^Its die often rocovpTPfl ftvm, j.:.,. • recovered fr-oni, without this operation bein ny eases partial resection may be substituted for it. g necessary ; and in214 INJURIES OF SOFT PARTS. G. In those cases in which a large artery, as the femoral, is lacerated at the same time that the soft parts arc extensively injured, and the bone fractured, amputation is required in oi’dcr to prevent the occuiTcnce of gangrene. In the moi'e local form of traumatic gangrene, in which the disease is confined to the part directly crushed and injured, no good can come of delay, and amputation should be performed as soon as mortification has declared itself ; and the limb must be removed at a sufficient distance from the seat of mischief. Thus, if gangi'eiie of the foot or ankle come on in consequence of a smash of these parts, the upper part of the leg or the thigh in its lower part should be amputated. T\Tien the mortification results indirectly from injmy of the vessels, the limb should also be immediately removed in a line with the wound, unless this be too high up ; then the most favoimable point must be seized, as will hereafter be explained. Amputation in these circumstances is by no means a very nnfavoiu’able operation (and it is one that I have several times successfully performed), provided it be done sufficiently early, before the constitution becomes poisoned by the absorption of morbid matters fr’om the gangrenous limb. It is scarcely necessary to warn the Siu-geon to be certain of the existence of gangrene before he operates ; and also that it be not a mere limited slough, but sufficiently extensive to jeopardise the patient’s life. 7. In those cases hi which the tme traumatic or rapidly spreading variety of gangi’ene is wholly or in part due to strangulation of the tissues by serous extravasation into the areolar iilanes, much benefit may be anticipated, and the further progress of the malady stayed, by early and free incisions carried through the engorged structures {debridement) ; an outlet is thus afforded to the effused fluids and to those portions of areolar tissue aheadyin a state of slough. But in aU others, and these unfortunately are by far the most numerous, in which the true traumatic or inqndly spreading gangrene has set in, the Siugeon will be placed in a great difficidty, whichever way he act. If he trust to con- stitutional treatment, in the hope of a line of demarcation forming, he will almost certainly be disappointed, the gangrene rapidly spreading up to the trunk ; and if he amputate, he may probably lose his patient by the stranp becoming affected. Yet amputation should, in my opinion, be performed at once. For, although this operation is necessarily very mifavoiuable when practised in these cases, in consequence of the gangrene not being a local affection, but dependent on constitutional causes, yet it must be remembered that, if the Surgeon Avait for the line of demarcation or trust to other means, such as incisions or general treatment, the patient will almost to a certainty die The patient’s safety m these cases, then, lies in amputating early, and removing the limb high above the part affected ; thus, in spreading gangr-ene of the aim, at the shoulder-joint; and of the leg, in the upper part of the thigh. The necessity for high amputation in these cases is owing to the gangTeue spreading more extensively in the areolar tissue than it does in the skin ; and hence in reality invading the limb to a higher point than it appears externally to do. In most cases it ivill be found that the infiltration precursory to the gangi-enous mischief rims up one side of the limb-the inner or posterior-to a much gi-cater extent than the other. In amputating under such circimstanccs, the Surgeon may often very advantageously so fashion his flaps as to exclude as much as possible of the affected part or side of the hmb, forming them chief!)215 AMTUTATION FOR CONTUSED WOUNDS. from that least alfected. A principal source of danger and of death after am- putation in those cases, is the great disposition to the recurrence of the morbid condition in the stump, more particularly iu the lower extremity. (.)ut of twelve cases iu which I have seen or done amputation for this disease, this reciurence happened in seven instances. This tendency wU be increased by the proximity of the line of amputation to the gangrenous limit. But, even under the most unfiivourable circumstances, recovery ivill sometimes take place. Thus I have seen the flaps iu amputation for’spreadiiig gangTene infil- trated with gelatinous-looking fluid, and yet recovery take place. In a man whose arm I amputated at the shoulder-joint for^ spreading gangrene of the limb, the infiltration had extended as high as the scapula ; yet he made a 'veiy excellent recovery. In the lower extremity the liability to reciureiice of the gangrene is, howei'er, very much greater; and there can be but very little prospect of sa'sdng the patient if the thigh have once become reddened and infiltrated, even though the gangrene do not extend above the knee—invasion of the stump ensuing mider such circumstances with almost absolute certainty. JIuch of the success of the case will depend on the after-treatment. This must consist principally of light di’essings to the stump, full doses of liquor opii, and the eai’ly and free administration of stimulants, more particularly brandy and wine ; and attention to these points will often bring the patient tluough, though usually not without much difficulty and great constitutional distiu’bance. The question as to the jjeriocl at which amputation should be performed in contused wounds, has aheady been considered at pp. 57 to 59. It may be generally stated, that the sooner a condemned hmb is taken off, the less is the suffering, and the better the chance of recovery to the patient; and that, con- sequently, primary amputation should be practised hi these cases. By refer- ence to the tables on p. 57, it will be seen that, although the average mortality for all primary operations is less than the average mortality for all secondary operations, yet primary amputation through the thigh is more fatal than secondary amputation in the same region. Notwithstanding this, it is absolutely necessary in many cases to remove the injured limb within the first twenty- foiu hours. The higher rate of mortahty of primary thigh amputations may bo chiefly duo to the greater severity of the injuries that manifestly require immediate operation, than of those in which it is thought justifiable to attempt to^ save a limb ; and certainly, of the two alternatives, of leai'ing a badly crushed and mangled limb until siippiuation has set up, and thus exposing the patient to all the risks of gangrene, erysipelas, pyaamia, &c., or removing it at once, the latter is the one attended with least danger to the patient. A limli is sometimes so soA’erely and hopelessly crushed and torn that any attempt at its preservation must be useless ; whilst at the same time the patient is so severely injured internally, or is so prostrated by the general shock to the system, that amputation as a formal operation would be as useless as it would be unjustifiable, the patient having at most, perhaps, but a few hours to live. In these circumstances the best thing that can be done is to put on a tourniquet tightly, partly to restrain hannorrhage, and partly to restrain the painful quivering of the muscles, and to wrap up the maimed limb in a Avet cloth. (Should tlic limb have been nearly completely detached—INJUIUES OF SOFT PARTS. 2i6 merely hanging on by shi-eds of the lacerated museles—these may be di\ icled, and its removal thns effected without additional shock or suffering. Brush-Burn. There is a peculiar species of wound, that partakes perhaps more of the characters of those ^younds that we have just been considering than of any other, and is occasioned by rapid and sevex’e friction of the siu'face of the body, so that the skin becomes abraded and the subjacent tissues somewhat contused. It goes by the name of a “ brush-burn,” and is not unfr’erpiently produced in the manufacturing districts, by the sm-facc of the body coming into contact -with straps.or portions of machinery in rapid revolution. It has also been known to occur in consequence of a person slipping and sliding rapidly douui a long and steep Alpine snow-slope. In this injiuy the integu- mental structiu’es are, as it were, ground off, and the areolar and aponein-otic structui’es converted into an eschar. The Treatment presents nothing special, but may be conducted on ordinary principles. The separation of the eschars must be facihtated by water-dress- ing and poultices ; the resulting sores will heal by gTanulation ; and the general health must be supported diuing the suppiuative period that must necessarily ensue. PUNCTURED WOUNDS. These woiuids, made by narrow sharp-pointed instrimients, vary greatly in extent, from the prick of a needle in the finger to a sword-thrust through the body. Not imfr’equently punctrued wounds are somewhat con- tused, being made by a triangular or wedge-like weapon, as a bayonet or lance- blade. Hence they partake of the general character of contused woimds, having a tendency to unite by gTanulation from the bottom, and to be accom- panied by much inflammatory action. When deep, they are of a most dangerous character—woimdiug blood-vessels, traversing the great cavities, and injuring the contained vuscera. Treatment.—In the treatment of punctiued wounds, the principal points are to arrest the haemorrhage, and to facilitate union. The hmmorrhage must be arrested by pressiue properly apphed by means of compresses or pads, so as to approximate the sides of the pimctm'e ; by the application of cold ; or by cutting do'wn on the injiued vessel if it be a large one, and ligatiuing it .above and below the perforation in it. In the majority of cases, unless the injiuy be a slight one, suppiuation and rmion by the second intention will take place. But in many instances imion by adhesion is obtained ; and in those that are allowed to suppurate, there can be little doirbt that the same favoiuable termination might be seemed if proper- attention Avere paid to the irrjmy. The cavity shoirld be injected rnth car-bolic acid lotion ; all srrper-fluorrs moistme shordd be then carefrrlly exirressed ; the exterrral openiirg closed by collodiorr or styptic colloid, or after Lister s method ; and the sides kept in contact by compresses and bandages. Undue inflamma- tioir must be kept dowrr by coolirrg lotiorrs, &c.

The process of suction cleared the wound thoroughly of all blood, and, druAving the sides into close apposition, placed^tlie parts in the most favourable condition possible for union by adhesion. _ ibis practice might, perhaps, in many cases be advantageously imitated m the present day by means of a cupping-glass and synngc. i\jnougst the vai-ieties of pimctured wounds that are most commonly met , with in o“rdinai-y practice, are those Avhich arc occasioned by needles penetrat- ino- into, and breaking off in the body. These accidents chiefly occim in the fingers and feet, and about the nates ; and, though triAial, are often extremely troublesome, both to Surgeon and to patient. When the Surgeon is called shortly after the occm-rence of the accident, he must endeavour to remove the frag-ment left behind, by cutting doAAm upon it. In doing this he AAiU be guided V the situation of the pimcture, and by the seat of the pain, i‘ and soinetimes by feeling the point projecting under the skin. In many cases this is a sufliciently simple proceeding ; in others, however, a deep and trouble- some dissection may be required, especially when the fragment of needle gets into or imder the sheaths of a tendon. I have had occasion to undertake someAvhat troublesome dissections between the biceps tendon and the brachial artery, or in the close proximity of the ulnar artery, for the removal of frag- ments of needles lodged in the bend of the arm and the AArist. For the pm^iose of extracting needles, thorns, sphnters of wood, and other foreigm bodies of small size and pointed shape lying in narrow wounds, the forceps shoAm in the annexed Avoodcut (Fig. 81) Avill be found most serviceable, as they haA’e very fine but strong and weU-serrated points. One of the most dangerous situations for a needle to penetrate is into the anterior part of the knee-joint, lodging on the head of the tibia or the patella, and breaking off short. In such cases the broken fragment should be dissected out at once, the limb put on a splint, and the ice-bag applied, so as to check inflanunation of the johit. I have knoAvn the most disastrous and disorganising inflammation and suppm’ation of the knee-joint ensue, Avith imminent peril to life, and folloAved by ankylosis, in consequence of a portion of needle having been alloAA^ed to remain embedded in this situation for some days. In many cases, if the needle haA’e been lodged for some days, the burgeon aaiII fail in his endcaA'ours to extract it ; and, unless the indications of its presence be very clear, I think the AAo’ser course would bo to leave it undisturbed, and to trust to natime for its expulsion from the body, as it can seldom be fm;nd aaFcu sought for, and, indeed, may not exist, although supposed to be present. The foUoAving plan of ascertaining Avhether a portion of needle be really impacted has been suggested by Marshall. A poAAmfful magnet is to be held upon the part for a quarter of an hoim, so as to influence the fragment; a finely hung lAolariscd needle should then be suspended over it, Avhen, if any iron be present, deflection aauII ensue. ' _ When a fish-hook, crochet-needle, or other barbed instrument has been nuA into the flesh, no attempt should be made to AvithdraAv it through the aperture Fig. 81.— Forceps for removing Small Point- ed Bodies.2lS INJURIES OF SOFT FARTS.

Pressiu’c mth a piece of fluffy lint for five or ten minutes usually suffices, or the bite may be touched with a point of nitrate of silver ; but, if this do not arrest the bleeding, a needle should be passed across the bite, and a silk thi’cad wound roimd it. The needle may be removed in twenty-four hours.

They differ only in one essential respect from penetrating pimctm'ed wounds received by knife-stabs and sword-thrusts, viz., that the aiTOWor its head Avill remain impacted in the tissues it has penetrated. The force "with which an arrow may be shot is well illustrated in the accompanying figimes (82, 83) taken from preparations in the Army Museum at Washington. The arrow shot from the bow of a North American Indian has becnknoivn to traverse the body of a buffalo and penetrate the under siuface of its scapula, as iUustiated by a preparation in the Museum at Washington. The extraction of an arroiv is usually attended by little difficulty. But i Fig S3.—BiifTalo Rib ]iieroed by Iiidiim Ari-ow. (U. S. Anny Med.

With the wew of effecting safely its removal, the ‘ snares figured (Pig. 84) have been devised. In the event ot a large blood-re'ssc, arteiT, or vein being wounded in the head, thorax, or abdomen penetrated by the aiTOW, no special treatment is required beyond that which relates to tb extraction of the missile.219 G UN-SIIOT WO UNDS. CHAPTER X. GUN-SHOT WOUNDS Of the special varieties of contused and lacerated Avonnds, none are of more interest than the different forms of gun-shot injmy. Though compara- tively rare in chil practice in this conntiy, yet gmi-shot wounds are of suffi- ciently frequent occiuTeuce to render an acquaintance Avith them indispensable to the general Surgeon. To the military Surgeon the study of them is neces- sarily one of peculiar interest and importance ; and to him I Avonld specially recommend the perusal of the works of Pare, Wiseman, Hemien, Guthrie, Larrey, and Stromeyer, and of other Siu'geons who haA-e had imusual opportunities of studying the uatiu-e of these injuries upon the field of battle, and by whom they haA'e been considered AAith all the minuteness of a speciahty, I purpose in the foUoAving observations to confine myself chiefiy to such a general discussion of the subject as is required by the ciAul Siu'geon, Gun-shot injuries constitute a species of contused and lacerated wounds, characterised in some cases by the peculiar apj)earance presented by the coloiu’, shape, and size of the orifice ; and in others by the extensWe injmy inflicted on tissues, both superficial and deep-seated, in consequence of which the wounds may prove rapidly or immediately fatal. If the sufferer siu'viA'e the im- mediate effects of the injmy, high inflammatory action with much pain and tension, together Avith profuse discharge, deep-seated suj)puration, and other serious and A'eiy protracted after-consequences, are apt to supervene. These peculiai’ities haA'e at different times been attributed to the parts being bmiit by the ball, to the ijoisonous nature of projectiles, to the generation of electricity in the bullet, during its passage through the air, or by its Metion against the barrel. All these opinions, hoAA'ever, have been shoAAm to be erroneous ; and every peculiarity presented by these injuries can be accounted for by the bluntness of the contusing body, the rapidity of its motion, and the force with Avhiqh it is dn'A'en. As John Bell has pithily remarked, “ there is a peculiarity, but no^ mystery, in gun-shot AA'ounds.” That the sloughing AA'hich always ocems in the track of a bullet AAmund is due to the bhmtncss of the body Avith which the injury is inflicted, is eA"ident from the fact that sharp splinters of shell haA'e been knoAvn to inflict clean-cut Avounds. Chakactees. Gun-shot Avounds vary greatly according to the Natiu’c of the Projectiles, to the Force Avith Avhich they are driA'en, and to the Direction in Avhich they strike. Nature and Force of Projectile.—Gun-shot in juries of a serious character may be inflicted by u'cajions charged onlg with jwivder. They may arise fi'om the nicre concussion of the explosion ; thus a pistol charged Avith poAAxler, aiiddis- c arged Avuth the muzzle resting against the chest of a man, has been known to ly concussing the heart. In other cases, a portion of"the imexploded220 GUN-SJrOT WOUNLS. pomlor may bo dviven into or even through the skin by that Avhich is exploded behmd it. Tn this Avay, A-ery troulilesome and disfiguring marks are sometimes inflicted on the face, and other parts of the body, by the cliarcoal of the poAvder lodging in the slan. That a Aveapon so charged may actually kill Avheii discharged at a little distance, appears from a case related by Dupuytrcn, in Avhich a foAvling-piece charged Avith poAAxIcr only, and fired at the distance of tAvo or three feet from the abdomen, pierced the beUy Avith a round hole and killed the man. The mere force of the explosion Avill sometimes produce serious lacerations. Suicides occasionally forget to put a bullet into the pistol, and firing into their mouths, bloAv open the cheeks, and injure the phaiynx and glottis by the ex- plosive force. Some years ago, a man Avas brought to University College Hospital, Avho had discharged some poAvder from the tube of an Italian iron into bis mouth, and died in consequence of the injiuies he received. In another case in the same Institution, a man died on the fifth day after firing a pistol into his mouth, of asphyxia, occasioned by sloughing of the pharynx and in- flammation of the glottis and larynx, consequent on the scorch of the explosion. Wadding and soft materials, as pieces of clothing, AviU occasionally inflict serious Avomids by the force Avith Avhich they are driven. These injuries often happen on the stage, at revieAVS, fairs, &c, Taylor relates several instances of the kind :—one of a girl killed by a gun charged Avith paper pellets ; also, one of a man Avho Avas killed by a kid glove fired from a blunderbuss. Small shot often inflict serious injuries, and these are most commonly met Anth in civil practice. If the person wounded be Avithin a feAV feet of the muzzle of the gun, a terribly torn and lacerated Avound, of a very serious character, even Avorse than that occasioned by a bullet, Avill be inflicted ; for the shot, not being scattered, are driA^en through the body in a comparatively compact mass, and tear the tissues to a great extent. The compactness of a charge of shot Avhen striking close to the muzzle of the gun may be A’eiy remarkable, making a AA'^oimd like that of a bullet. A lad Avas admitted into University College Hospital imder my care, Avho had accidentally shot himself in the ann. The Avhole charge had passed fr’om before backAvards betAveen the brachial vessels and plexus of nerves and the skin of the inner sides of the arm, leaving a bridge of skin about three inches in Avidth and the vessels and nerves uninjined, the triceps, hoAvever, being torn. The patient made an excellent recovery. When shots scatter as they fly, they produce at a greater distance a less serious injury, usually lodging in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, Avhere they may remain for years, requiring to be picked out Avith a lancet; or they may give rise to suppuration. Occasionally, shot, by penetrating an important part, may cause serious or fatal results ; thus, a single shot penetrating the eyeball AviU destroy vision ; or, lodging in the heart or in the femoral vein or other large A'essel, may give rise to rapidly fatal results. A patient aaus once brought to University College Hospital, Avho had fired a pocket-pistol loaded Avith small shot into his mouth ; after death, the shots Avere found to have penetrated the anterior portion of the vertebral column, in AA^hich they Avero deeply lodged. Splinters of shells inflict grave injury; as also do those of metal, wood, or stone, canled by the force of the explosion, as in blastuig and mining221 DIRECTION. operations. These latter inflict perhaps the worst forms of injury from bodies propelled by explosive force that are met with in ciml practice. In siege opera- tions much injury also is often inflicted by the splinters from parapets, or by the forcible throwing up of gi-avel and small stones by the explosion of shells. In naval actions too, the force ^\dth which splinters of wood are driven, when struck and scattered by cannon-shot, is often so great as to inflict the most serious and fatal mischief. A particular form of injury sometimes met with in civil practice, and which belongs to this class, is a wound of the eyeball by the explosion and splintering of faulty percussion-caps. Wounds of the face and other parts from the splashes or splinters of ImUets fi-om the sm-face of targets, are of common occiuTcnce among markers at rifle-ranges. Bxillets, slugs, and grape-shot, occasion more serious wounds than any that have yet been described ; lacerating soft parts, fractming and crushing bones, tearing asunder vessels and nerves, perforating the viscera, and occa- sionally cutting off parts, as a Anger, the nose, or an ear. The general introduction of rifled fire-arms into modem warfare has greatly increased the destractive effects of bullets. The missile is now comparatively rarely deflected from its course by the resistance offered by bones, tendons, or by the elastic reaction of the skin, as happened vith the spherical baU, but penetrates in a straight line from the point struck, tearing through the soft parts, and splinter- ing the bones extensively. On the bones especially, the modern conico-cylindrical lulM produces the most de- structive effects ; not only comminuting the part struck, but often splitting up the shaft of the bone, by its wedge-like action, in Assures many inches long, leading into contiguous joints. (Fig. 85.) In consequence of the greater and more sudden disorganisation of the soft parts, the shock to the nervous system is greater when a pcrso]i is struck by a conico-cylindrical than by a spherical ball. Direction.—In the majority of cases, a bullet tra- verses, and the wound has two apertures, one of entry, the other of exit; occasionally it happens, however, that in consequence of the ball being spent, or of the piece not having been eflicicntly loaded, or of the oblique iZy snSf) direction with Avhich the ball strikes the part, it merely leaves a contusion oi' dent, reboimding oi* glancing' off. In other cases there is only one apertm’e ; and here the bullet, partly spent, has probably lodged in the soft tissues, or in a bone, or in the cavity of a hollow organ, as the bladder. It sometimes happens, however, that the ball efrops *^out through the apertime at which it entered, as when a spent ball strikes a rib; or that it can-ies a pouch of clothing before it, which enables the Surgeon to Avithdraw it. One bullet may ex^en make more than two apertiu’es: thus a ball has been kno^^m to split against the sharp edge of the tibia, and to have one aperture of entry and two of exit; or it may pass through both thighs or both calves, and thus occasion four apertures ; and cases have been recorded in which five wounds oven have been made in the same person by one222 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. bullet Conico-cyliudi'ical balls, as has been already observed, tear ti.eir w tbrouo-h the strong-est and densest osseous structures. llie direction of the openings is often of importance in a medico-legal as well as in a sm-gical point of view. Thus, Sir Astley Cooper, by attending- to this circimistance m a case of murder, ascertained that the fatal shot nmst have been fired by a left-handed man; and this led to the detec- tion of the criminal. These apertures, though usually opposite to one another Avhen a ball passes right through a part, are not always so, the bullet being deflected by the bones, or by the elasticity of the skin, so that the twe apertures do not correspond. Thus a bullet has been known to strike a ri]> and to be then deflected, running under the skin to the opposite side of the body ; again, sti-iking one temple, a bullet has been earned imder the scalp to the other side of the head, where it has passed out; thus it might appear, that important cavities had been penetrated when in reality they had not been wounded. _ The Apertures of Entry and of Exit, made by a bidlet, deserve atten- tive consideration. Much discussion has arisen as to whether there be any difference between these aper- tiu’es, and, if so, to what it is owing. That there is a diffe- rence in the great majority of cases, there can be no doubt; though this difference is, as a rule, not so decided in the case of the modern rifle-ball as in that of the spherical. Thus, in the latter instance, the hole made by the entrance of the bullet is small, circular in shape, less than the diameter of the ball in breadth, the edges being shghtly inverted and ecchy- mosed (Fig. 8G); whereas, in the former, the aperture of entry is more lacerated crucial, or starred, and lai’ger than case, the hole made by the exit of Fig. S6.—Guii-sliot Wound. Aperture of Entry. Fig. S7.—Guu-sliot Wound. Apertiue of E.rtt. and inegidar in oiithne, often hnear. the diameter of the ball. In either ^ the ball is a large, somewhat everted, and irregular apertme, into which two or three fingers may be freely passed (Fig. 87). In some cases, however, there is no appreciable difference between the two ; and in others, after a time, the aperture of entry is larger than that of exit. There can be no doubt that Guthrie has given the con-ect explanation of these discrepancies, when he states, that the amount of the difference in the tAVO apertures viU depend partly on the momentum of the ball, and partly on the resistance Avith which it meets. If the ball strike shortly after its dis- charge, at the maximum of its A'elocity, it Avill make but a small roimd hole, not shattering the parts so much as separating them. If it traverse a partCANNON-BALLS. 223 composed of soft tissue, meeting with but little resistance in its passage, it loses but little of its momentum ; and passing out of the body with nearly the same force as that with which it entered, it makes an aperture of exit that ditfei-s hut slightly, if at all, from that of entiy. If the ball strike a bone in its passage through the limb or body, and thus, by meeting with much resist- ance, have its momentum materially lessened, the aperture of exit will be torn, largo, and ragged, differing materially from that of entry. But in addition to tlnTconditions given by Guthrie, there are two other circumstances that tend to occasion a difference between the apertures of entry and of exit. The first is, that the bullet as it traverses carries with it a mass of foreign material, pieces of clothing, shreds of tendons, splinters of bone, which, driven along by the velocity commnnicated to them by the ball, distend and Avidely separate the distant parts of the wound and thus cause the aperture of exit, near and in which, they will be fonnd to l)e lodged, to be larger than that of entry, which has oidy admitted the buUet. The aperture of entry is made solely by the ball. The apertime of exit is made by it, plus the debris that it can’ies along with it. An additional reason for the difference in size between the two apertimes is this, that the ^vide tearing asunder of the tissues at the aperture of exit is greatly due to their want of support. The jDart first struck has as a supjDort the whole thickness of the limb or the body. That which is last perforated has no such support behind it, and is thus lai’gely torn or splintered outwards. This is- exactly what happens if we drive a nail through a board. If supported by another piece of wood, the apertures on the tAvo sides are eA’en and of the same size. If imsupported, the aperture in the distant side, that of exit, in fact, AviU be splintered, irregular in shape, and larger than that of entry. In bnllet-wounds the entrance-aperture is actually less in diameter than the bnUet itself, proAuded it be made whilst the ball is moving Avith its fidl velocity; but if the ball have lost much of its momentum before it strikes, then the entrance-wound aaiU always be large and ragged. In this there is nothhig pecidiar to the tissues of the living body ; the same happens when any elastie material, as a piece of green timber, is struck. Much, however, Avill also- depend on the period at which the Avound is examined. In. the early stages, for the reasons mentioned, the Avound of entry may be smaller than that of exit; but, as the eschar Avhich forms in the Avound of entiy is lai’ger than that at the exit-aperture, the former may, in a later stage, appear larger than the latter. This difference in the size of the two Avoimds I saw Avell exemplified in the case of a young man, shot through the neck in a duel, Avith a pistol-ball. The aperture of entiy, Avhich Avas at first the smallest, appeared on the second day the largest in consequenee of the extrusion of a black eschar ; though it- continued more regular in shape than that of exit. Cannon-balls inflict tAvo kinds of injiu’ies. They may contuse a part deeply, crushing muscles and bones, Avithout destroying the integrity of the skin, the ball either having lost its velocity, and being sjient, or strikino- obliquely, or rolling over the surface of the body. The elasticity of the skin preseiwes this from injiuy, though all the subjacent textures—bones, muscles, and vessels—may be totally disorganised and crushed into a pulp, if a limb be- struck ; if the trunk itself be uninjiu’ed, the vertebral column and lumbar muscles may be disorganised, and the liA'er, kidneys, spleen, stomach, and224 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. intestines rnptured witliont any ])reach of surface. These injuries, formerly ciioneously attiibutccl to the action of the current of air set in motion by the ball, are known by the name of wind-contusions. Hubcutancous contusions of similar character, though less severe in degree, may also be produced by bullets. In some of these contusions gangrene of the limb sets in; apparently, as Guthrie has pointed out, from the rupture of the principal vessels. Cannou- shot more commonly carry away the whole thickness of a part, tearing and shattering a limb, carrying off the thick and fleshy parts of thigh, caTf, or shoulder ; or they may inflict the most fearful injuries by smashing the trunk and head. Frag-ments of shell, particularly if large, inflict wounds ecprally destructive to life and limb. A small fragment may either become lodged, or make its way out, the aperture of entry being somewhat incised, though very irregular, and the aperture of exit large and ragged. SvjrpTOMS.—The chief peculiarities of gun-shot injuries consist in the amount and character of the Pain, the severity of the Shock, the compara- tively little liability to Haemorrhage, and the severity of the Consecutive Inflammation. The Pain in gun-shot injiu’ies varies gveatly. It is most severe when a bone is fr-actured, or a large cavity penetrated ; when soft structures alone are injured, a dull and heavy sensation is experienced, which has often been com- pared to that occasioned by a blow vuth a stick. In many cases, however, the sufferer is not aware that he is shot till he is told of it. I have kunvm a person shot in the leg by a pistol-baU, and not know that he was Avoimded till told that his leg was bleeding. This is especially apt to happen when the mind is actively engaged, as in the height of battle ; no pain is experienced, and the sufferer does not know that he is wounded until he is told so, or sees the blood. Hemien has known a limb carried off or smashed to pieces by a carmon-shot, without the sufferer being conscious of it; and Macleod relates the case of an oflicer who, in the Crimea, had both legs carried away, and who was not aware of the injury till he tried to rise. In gun-shot injinles, the Shock to the Nervous System is always very gveat where parts of importance, as the head, chest, and abdomen, or large joints, as the knee, are opened ; and the severity of the shock is indicative of the amount of mischief inflicted. As has aheady been stated, the shock is more severe when a wound is inflicted by a conical bullet from a rifle, than when made by a spherical ball fr'om the old smooth-bore. Thus, if a bullet appear to have traversed the chest, but in reality has been deflected imder the skin, the com- parative absence of shock will serve, to a certain extent, to prove that risceral mischief has not been inflicted. In some cases the shock alone appears sufiicient to kill ; thus, a man shot by a pistol-bullet, which traversed the distended stomach, died in a few seconds fr’om shock, there being no bleeding of importance, or other discernible cause of immediate death (laylor). In some cases, however, that are mortal, the symptoms of shock are but slight. The Primary Hsemorrliage from gim-shot wounds varies nccessarilj according to the situation of the injiu'y and the size of the vessels injured ; cccteris paribus, these wounds bleed less than other injuries ; but in all cases a certain and in many a large and fatal quantity of blood is lost. When the225 INFLAMMATION OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS. fleshy parts of a limb are perforated by a l)ullefc, the haemorrhage is usually very trifling, the vessels divided being small, and contused rather than cut across. If the whole of a limb bo tom away by a cannon-shot, the arteries of the jagged stump do not bleed, for the same reasons that those of a limb torn away by machinery do not; viz., the contraction and retraction of the ruptured internal and middle coats, and the twisting of the external cellular coat over them. This explanation is disputed by Verneuil, who has described instances where, in severe gim-shot and shell wounds of the leg recpiiring amputation, the arteries had all their coats cut through at the same level, and yet haemor- rhage did not occur. But, though it may be stated as a general rule that gun- shot wounds do not bleed much, yet when a large artery, as the carotid, ihac, or femoral, is cut across, violent and suddenly fatal haemorrhage wdU occur— the vessel bleeding as freely as if divided with the knife. Bullet-wounds of the large and deep ai'teries of the chest and abdomen are almost immediately fatal fr-om haemorrhage. The greater nmnber of those who die on the field of battle perish fr-om this cause. It has often been observed that arteries escape, though lying apparently in the direct track of a ball. In such cases, how^ever, though primai-y haemon-hage do not occur, the liability to secondary haemor- rhage is great, in consequence of the artery which has been contused by the passage of the bullet sloughing at a later period. Gim-shot womids always Inflame, with much Swelling, Infiltration, and Tension; The pain which, at the moment of infliction, may have been but slight, becomes extremely acute when inflammation has set in, o-wing princi- pally to the gi-eat tension. This, indeed, is one of the most remarkable phenomena of gun-shot injury, and, by giving rise to strangulation of the tissues, is often the cause of serious mischief. The inflammation speedily terminates m suppuration, often most profuse and extensive, not only in the tiack of the ball, but vddely diffrised through the neighbom-ing pai'ts. Ajjeriod of great danger in gun-shot wounds is that about which the sloughs begin to separate, usually from the sixth to the twentieth day ; and before this time it is often impossible to ascertain the precise extent of the disorganisation. At this period, also. Consecutive Haemorrhage is very apt to come on, even after very slight exertion, without any warning. Baudens states that this occuiTence is most likely to happen on the sixth day. This may be suddenly latal, and is always more dangerous than the primary hremon-hage, not only on account of the difficulty of arresting it, but because the patient has been already weakened by severe inflannnation and suppiu-ation. Secondary haemoiThage may occin from other causes than the separation of the sloughs and the consequent opening up of a contused or inflamed artery. It may take place from an artery wounded by a spiculum of fr-actined bone ; and fr-om the same cause it may arise at any period until all detached bone is separated and the wound fli-mly cicatrised. Chisholm, of the American Confederate army mentions a case of death by secondary hemorrhage on the 828th day after a gmn-shot fractm-c of the upper third of the thigh, owing to a wound of the emoKd artery by a detached sequestrum. Independently of this daim-er from secondary hemorrhage, the patient, if his limb bo saved, may have to undei-o-o ong and tedious processes of exfoliation of dead bone, and to run the risk of eicun-cnt attacks of erysipelas, hospital gangrene, and visceral mischief ^226 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. There is ercry reason to belioA’o that warfare in modern times is fully as clestructiA-e to life as it was foianerly, if not much more so ; not in the propor- tion of the killed to the ninnher of combatants engaged, but in relation to the recoveries among the Avonnded. This at first sight appears remarkable, Avhen Ave consider the great advances that have of late years been made in surgical treatment and in sanitary aiTangements. But it is readily explained by the facts that the size and form of the projectiles noAV used, and the force Avith Avhich they are driven, are such as to render the wounds inflicted by them infinitely more destructive than they used to be ; and that the advance in surgical treat- ment is thns more than neutralised by the more deadly natime of the injuries, AA'hilst the enormous number of men engaged has yielded so large a proportion of sick and AVOiAiided that, after the first feAV weeks, the sanitary aiTangements haA'e hitherto broken down under the pressime, and secondary septic diseases haA'e committed the most frightful ravages. The complete siu’gical statistics of the gi’eat Franco-Grerman war haA*e not yet been made public ; but, so far as can be ascertained, there can be but httle doubt that the results of excisions and amputations, as well as those attending the treatment of compound fractiu’es, were far less satisfactory than in other recent wars. Treatment.—The slighter and pimely superficial gun-shot injiuies generally merely require to be treated on the ordinary principles that guide ns in th& management of contusions and larcerations generally. When they affect the- head, chest, or abdomen, they present so many circumstances of special im- portance, that we must defer the consideration of them mitil we treat of injiuies of those regions. In aU cases of gun-shot wound, whether amputation be ultimately required or not, certain immediate attentions are necessary in order to place the sufferer in some degree of comfort and safety. Thus, if a person be shot through the fleshy part of a limb, no bone or vessel of importance being injiued, the part should be covered AAuth Avet cloths, and placed in an easy position. ^ If there be abundant venous haimorrhage, the limb should be raised ; and if this do not ai-rest the bleeding, a compress should be used. If the heemoiThage be arterial,^ a toiuTiiquet must be applied. So, also, a tourniquet shoxdd be employed if there be rapid dripping of blood. If a limb be smashed, or torn away, a toiu-niquet should be applied very tightly upon the stump, Avhich must be covered up in wet cloths. ^ The pres- siu-e of the tourniquet aatII not only arrest haemorrhage, but^ aviU stay that spasmodic quivering of the muscles of the mangled hmb which is so painful to- the sufferer. , ^ r j If the head or neck be womided, cold wet pledgets should be applied, and hfemorrhage, whether venous or arterial, should be arrested by pressine Avith the fingers. . . , ., If the chest be shot through, the patient should be laid on the mimed side, and cold employed. If emphysema occm-, or if air freely pass through the Avound, a body-bandage must be tightly applied. _ If the abdomen be Avoiuided, the patient should be laid on the iniimed side if the aperture be lateral; if it be central, on his back, with the knees bent over a log or knapsack, or other support. If the intestine protrude, it must be Avashed and retimied at once.227 APdiEST OF HAEMORRHAGE. In addition to those immediate attentions, which may be bestowed upon sutterors fi'om gun-shot wounds before they are sent to the hospital for more methodical treatment, the influence of the shock should be counteracted by the administration of a little brandy-and-water, and plenty of cold water should be given to allay thirst. Gnn-sliot Wounds of the Extremities may bo divided into two great classes in reference to treatment:—I. Those that do not require amputation ; II. Those in which amputation is necessary. I. Those cases of gun-shot injury that do not require amputation must be treated on the principles that guide us in the management of all contused and lacerated wounds ; the Surgeon bearing in mind, however, that these injuries are especially apt to be followed by extensive and intense inflammatory action, and that sloughing will inevitably result in every part that has been touched by the ball. The first point to be attended to in these cases is the Arrest of Haemorrhage. In general, this may not give much trouble ; but, if a large vessel be injured, the loss of blood will rapidly prove fatal, unless immediately stopped. The bleeding- may in the first instance be stopped by direct pressiu-e with the fingers on the bleeding part, followed by the apifiication of the toiu’iiiquet; or, if this instrument be not at hand, of some simple substitute, such as a pebble, of about the size of an 6gg, rolled in the middle of a pocket-hand- kerchief and laid over the artery, the ends of the handkerchief being knotted round the limb, and then twisted up tightly with a piece of stick or the hilt of a swoi'd passed under it (Fig. 88). The wound in the arteiy may render amputation of the limb necessary ; if not, hemorrhage must be jDennanently aiTested by making an in- cision down to the bleeding vessel, and applying a ligatiu’e on each side of the Avound, for reasons that mil be fuUy stated ^vhen we come to speak of Injuries of Arteries. In military practice such opera- Fig. 88.—Gun-sliot Wound of Thigh : Mode of Comi)ressing Aiteiy temporarily. filct is that if i lovn f ^ i is scarcely ever practised. The from patient osrmlly dies ontrigU Q 2GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 228 If the ImlM lodge, it, together with foreign bodies accompanying it, such as pieces of clothing, must be extracted through the Avound, or cut out by a counter-opening. This second opening is often of great utility in affording a ready exit for subsequent discharges, &c. Palpation of the limb or region struck will often lead to the discovery of the buUet, Avhen it lies amongst the muscles or beneath the skin. A consideration of the direction whence the bullet came, and the position of the patient when hit, Avill often direct attention to the spot where the ball has lodged. If possible, the same position of body or limb should be assumed ; the track of the bullet will thus be straightened, and the finger or probe can be carried down to it more readily. In searching for bullets and other foreign bodies, care should be taken not to probe the wound unnecessarily from mere curiosity, or so as to excite irritation; in many cases, the introduction of the finger is far more useful than that of the probe. The advice given by Ambroise Pare, three himdi-ed years ago, with regard to the examination of gun-shot wounds, can scarcely be improved upon. After advising that the examination of the Avound be made as soon after the injiuy as possible, before swelling and inflammation set in, he says : “This is the principal thing in the performance of this work, that you place the patient in just such a postiue as he Avas in at the receiving of the Avound ; for other- Avise tfie various motions and turning of the muscles Avill either hinder or straighten the passage forth of the contained bodies. You shall, if it be pos- sible, search for these bodies Avith your finger, that you may the more certainly and exactly perceive them. Yet if the buUet be entered somewhat deep in, then you shall search for it Avith a round and blunt probe, lest you put the patient to pain.” The extraction of the iullet should be accomj)lished Avithout delay, before inflammation has set in, and the lips and sides of the wound have become swollen. As Macleod justly obseiwes, the extraction of the ball not only removes a soiuce of physical irritation and suffering, but also of mental disquietude. The mind of the patient becomes more tranquil and easy. Bullets cannot be allowed to remain lodged in the body with impunity. It is true that in some cases they become encysted, and so cease to irritate ; but in the great majority of instances they produce suffering and constitutional dis- turbance, and may at last occasion fatal mischief ; for, although a bullet may continue fixed for years, yet it may at last, imder the influence of muscidar action, gravity, or the absorption of fat, begin to move and to give rise to injm-ious consequences. If any foreign body be very tightly fixed, so that it cannot easily be removed, it must be left till loosened by suppmation. Some- times a bullet is firmly fixed in the cancellous structme of the articular end of a bone. It may be removed thence by means of an eleA'ator or by the screw- ^ Various instruments are used for the detection and removal of bullets and other foreign bodies. There is usually no material difficulty in detecting the presence of a bullet, by means of an ordinary steel probe of sufficient length In some cases of peculiar and exceptional difficulty, Avheie t e ii e ’s c) deeply in the cancellous structure of a bone, or amongst swoUen and infiltrated tissues, its presence may be detected by the ingenious deAice a^ op e ly N61aton in the case of Garibaldi, of passing a probe armed AAuth a piece ot im- glazed porcelain doAAm to the suspected site of the bullet, and seeing if a streak ! l| \ .1229 SPLINTERS. of lend were loft on the rough snrfoce of the china (Fig. 89). Bullet-detectors have tdso been contrived, in which, by an an’angement of two isolated metal probes in a cannula connected ^nth a galvanometer, the galvanic circuit is completed when the bullet is touched, and the needle of the galvanometer, deflected ; or, instead of the latter instrument, the ordinary telegraph alarum may be interposed. For the remo^'al of bullets, long and strong forceps are required, the action of which may be aided by a screw-probe. The accom- pau}dng woodcuts (Figs. 90, 91, 02, 93, and 9d) represent the best forms of bullet-screws, forceps, and extractors. 9 > Fig. 89. Frobe. Figs. 90, 91, 92.—Biillet-scrcw, Forceps, and Extractor. Fig. 93.—Bullet-forceps. Fig. 94. Hook Splin- ter-Forceps. The splmte^'s produced by the passage of a ball throngh'a bone are more numerous and larger, Avhon the injmy has been inflicted with a conical rifle- a 1. The impetus of this projectile is so great, and its wedge-like action so estructive, that the bone struck is shattered into a mmiber of fragments, as longitudinally, often to a gxeat extent. These fragments ai’e e ached, to a greater or less extent from their comicctioiis with the soft parts tLhrT^'^ ® who rvas fond of systema- ary, and tefrlmry. By primary splinters are meant those which are-3° GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. carried completely aeross the limb, detached from the soft parts, and lodged near the aperture of cxit.^ The secondary splinters are those which are still attached by a strip of periosteum or fibrous tissue ; and the icriiary are those portions of bone which, from the \ioleiice done to them, often necrose and separate at a subsequent period. The treatment of these different kinds of splinters must necessarily vary. The primary, which are already completely detached and are incapable of consolidation, must be treated as foreign bodies and extracted. The secondary, if very loose, must also be removed; but, if more firmly fixed, they may be pushed into the axis of the injured bone and left, when they may become consolidated by callus, and so serve in the recon- struction of the bone. The tertiary, which do not separate until about six or seven weeks, must be removed as soon as possible ; if they become engaged in a mass of callus, it may be a considerable time before they are loose enough to be removed ; and, until then, sinuses leading down to them will remain open even for years. The reunion of comminuted gun-shot fractiues may be assisted by the resection of the fractm-ed ends of the bones, in appropriate cases. This plan has been especially successful in the bones of the upper extremities. The ends thus resected may ftuthermore be kept in apposition by metallic sutures, according to the plan suggested by Howard, of the American army. In those cases in which small shot are lodged under the skin, they may be tinned out by being cut doivn to with a fine scalpel. The Treatment of the Wound itself must be conducted on ordinary surgical principles. As has afready been stated, there wiU, as a ride, be idolent inflammation and sloughing along the whole track of the baU ; although instances have been recorded of primary imion in gun-shot wounds uncompheated with fractine or the lodgment of foreign bodies. The principal points to be attended to are, consequently, to limit the unflammation, to watch and facilitate the separation of the sloughs, and to pay scrupulous attention to cleanliness. By adopting in suitable cases, and under cfrcumstances where the requisite time and attention can be spared, the antiseptic method, both inflammatory action and the formation of sloughs may be avoided. Under this treatment, repair of giui-shot fractiu-e without suppuration or sloughing has in at least one instance been reported. In any case, no harm can accrue if the flrst dressing be conducted after that plan; if suppmation then ensue, it may stiU be treated by the usual methods -without detriment to the patient, who ■wUl have had the chance given him of escaping the sufferings and exhaustion attendant on the healing of an extensive woiuid by the second intention. In order to limit the inflammation, it was a common practice -ndth military Sm’geons, and still is so with the French, to enlarge by incision the wound made by the ball, ivith a idew of preventing tension and strangulation of jiarts. Since the time, however, when John Hunter pointed out that an incision could not alter the natme of a contused wound, and only superadded another injiiiy to the one afready inflicted by the bullet, British Surgeons have employed the knife, in the early stages of giui-shot wounds, only for the purpose of facilitat- ing the securing of bleeding vessels, or the extraction of foreign bodies. InTREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 231 the more advanced stages, however, free incisions, which should Ije made in the direction of the axis of the limb, are commonly required in order to lessen inflammatory tension, to prevent the extension of sloughing, and to fiu'our the escape of discharge. The best mode of lessening inflammation in a gun-shot wound in the early stages, and more especially in hot climates, is either cold irrigation or the application of dry cold by means of ice in India-rubber bags, conjoined with position and rest; at a later period, water-di-essing and poultices will be more useful. As suppuration comes on, we must substitute warm applications for the cold, so as to hasten the formation of matter and the separation of the sloughs, whilst disinfectants should be freely used to the whole cavity of the woimd. All bagging and burrowing of matter must be carefully guarded against by position and pressiu’e and drainage, and, if need be, a counter- opening. Free incisions may also now be required. These should not be delayed too long. They may be required for two purposes ; first, to remove the tension resulting from deep infiltration of the limb by inflammatory effusions, and by that means to prevent the strangulation of the tissues, and remove the severe constitutional reaction that is always consequent to and dependent upon this local inflammatory tension; and secondly, to ojjen up piu-ulent collections, which often depend upon the irritation of splinters, portions of clothing, and other foreign bodies that could not be removed in the fii'st instance. When the inflammatory action runs very high and will not yield to the measiu’es just enumerated, it may be necessary to compress or to tie the main artery leading to the part. At the period of the loosening and separation of the sloughs, there is always especial danger of the supervention of consecutive haemorrhage. The patient, consequently, at this time requires to be carefully watched; if the womvd be in the vicinity of a large vessel, a tourniquet should be placed loosely round the limb, so as to be screwed up at a moment’s notice ; and, on the supervention of bleeding, the artery must be ligatured, if possible, at the seat of the wound, or, if this be not practicable, in the most convenient situation above it; and if this do not arrest the bleeding, recourse should be had to amputation. In secondary haemorrhage following gun-shot wounds, Neudbrfer recommends the employment of a temporary ligatme. The method adopted by him consists in exposing the arteiy exactly as in the ordinary operation for the ligatm'e ; a silk thread or a wire is then passed round the vessel, and the two ends are carried sejoarately through the soft parts of one side of the womid, so as to appear about half an inch from the edge, and about half or three-quarters of an inch apart. The cuds are then fastened to a half cylinder of cork, and are left fr’om forty-eight to seventy-two hours, when they are removed. Serious results, such as abscesses, profuse discharges, necrosis, osteomyelitis, and the separation of splinters of bone, must be subsequently looked for in many cases ; and these results may be prolonged for many years, at last perhaps wearing out the patient if the cause of irritation be not removed. hus General J3cm required to have a buUct removed by Liston fr-om the cxtemal condyle of his femur, nineteen years after it fii-st lodged there ; and 1 arshal Moncey died forty years after the receipt of a gun-shot wound, from J s ettccts. A soldier who was wounded at the storming of the Redan, died-32 GVN-BILOT ^Y0UND8. under my care in .the University College Hospital, t^vo years and a half after t )at e^ eut, of exlianstion resulting from a large lumbar abscess. On examina- tion it was found that the bullet, which had entered the left side of the chest and wounded the huig, traversed the diaphragm, notched the spleen, passed between the kidney and suprarenal body, and perforated the spine, was lying encapsuled on the right side of one of the vertebne, pressing upon the riglft renal vessels. Its irritation, and that of the sequestra fi-om the injured spine, iwoduced the abscess, from the effect of which the patient died. The apertm-e of exit always heals sooner than the aperture of entry; owing, probably, as Heudorfer obser\-es, to the bullet having lost its lateral action in its passage through the tissues, and merely cutting its way out. It is at the pohit, he remarks, where the lateral action is lost, that healing begins. ° II. Amputation is required in gun-shot injmies in two classes of cases of very dissimilar character. In cases where the limb has been wholly or in part carried away, or where it is evidently hopelessly shattered, the ragged, conical, and quivering stump, or the mangled remains of the limb, must be removed. In such cases there can be no doubt whatever in the mind of any Surgeon, as to the necessity for immediate amputation. But there is another class of cases, where amputation is also very commonly required, though, to a Siu’geon judging solely from the accidents of ci\il life, it might not at first appear necessary. These are, especially, cases of comjmmd (jun-shot fractures of tJie thigh, bulM-woumls of the Icnee-joint, and many similar iujrules of the leg. Injuries such as these, occurrirrg from other causes irr civil practice, might admit of arr attempt being made to sar'e the limb. But in military practice it is different: here the attempt to save the hmb irray be followed by such extreme local arrd constitutiorral disturbairce as to jeopardise seriously, arrd probably to destroy, the patierrt’s life. In such circumstances, conservatism is ofterr a fatal error, arrd to save life the limb must be sacrificed. The irrjruy for which an experienced army Surgeorr krrows that amputatioir is imperative, may look but trifiirrg, arrd to the patient himself, or to the cmhan. may appear to justify treatmerrt by less severe irrocedm-e ; but exirerience has incorrtestably showrr that iir amputatiorr is almost the oirly charree of safety in gam-shot wormds of the lower third of the thigh and of the leg, fr’actruing the borres, or irrjrrring the kiree-joint. Dupuytrerr states that, in rejecting amprr- tatiorr in comporrrrd fr'actrn’es of the extremities from grrrr-shot, we lose more lives tharr we save limbs ; and Hemrerr is of opiniorr that irr aU “ ambigarorrs cases ” amputation shordd be perforoned. The following is a specificatiorr of the chief conditions in which amputation is required. 1. I^Tien the whole limb is caraded off, a ragged stump merely being left; so, likewise, if the limb be completely crushed and disorgarrisecl, whether b) direct blow or by a “ wind-coirtusion,” though still left adherent ; or again, it the principal vessels be injured aud the soft parts caraded away, thorrgh the borre be irrtact, the limb carrrrot be preserved. 2. Amprrtatiorr is especially rrecessary iir some of the more serdorrs injrrrdes of the lower extremity; thus, if a bullet divide the femoral vessels or theCOXDITIOiVS REQUIRING AMPUTATION. 233 sciatic nerve, and splinter the thigh-bone ; or if the sciatic nerve and soft parts at the back of the tliigh be carried away, althougli the vessels and bone l)e loft luiinjured, the case is one for amputation ; and, indeed, it may be stated generally (though, doubtless, there are exceptions to this, as to all general rules in surgery) that all compounil fraciures of the lotver third of the femur occasioned by gun-shot require amputation. The mortality, however, after amputation for gnn-shot injmy of the vj)per two-thirds of the thigh, is so very great, that many Surgeons have abandoned the operation in these cases, and professional opinion is un- settled as to the course that should be pursued. In the Schleswig-Holstein war of ISin, it became a question with many of the German and Danish Siu’geons whether this oiDeration should be continued, or Avhether the patient Avould not haA'e a better chance if the injury were treated on ordinary principles as a compound fracture. At the siege of Sebastopol, the mortality after amputation of the nipper third of the thigh was so great in the Russian army, that the Surgeons abandoned the operation. On the other hand, it is stated in the Report of the Black Sea Fleet, that to attempt to save the limb in any case of gun-shot fractiu’e of the thigh Avas to endanger the patient’s life. In the Crimea, Macleod states, that a bad compound fracture of the thigh from gun-shot was synonymous AAuth death. This was partly owing to the bad health of the troops, and partly to the tenlble effects of conical balls. In India, where romid bullets and matchlock balls were more used, the result Avas not so bad. Macleod states that, although he made every inquiry, he could hear of three cases only in which recovery had, in the Crimea, followed a compound fracture of the upper third of the thigh-bone without amputation. But, exceptional as were sucli recoA’eries, he states that they were not so rare as after amputation for similar injuries ; as indeed was proved by the fact that not one patient recoA’ered after amputation at the hip-joint. Hutin, the Surgeon to the IiiA alides in Paris, Avas able to discoA’er twenty-four cases of recovery after compound fracture above the middle of the thigh, but no case of recoA'ery after amputation for injury of the same part. In the British army in the Crimea, the amjAutations in the upper third of the thigh, which must haA'e been for compound fractures low down in the bone, were fatal, in the ratio of 8G per cent.; of those in the middle, probably for injuries of the lower articular end and knee, 00 per cent, died; Avhilst of those in the lower third, which must haAC been for injuries of the knee ajid leg, the mortality was reduced to 5G per cent. The conclusions at Avhich Macleod amA’es after a careful inquiry into t is question, are so important, that I give them in his own Avords. He says: ndei circumstances of Avar similar to those Avhich occuiTed in the East, AAC ought to try to save compound comminuted fr-actures of the thigh AA’hen SI lAatecl in the ii|Aper third ; but immediate amputation shoidd be had recoui’se 0 in the case of a like accident occumng in the middle and loAver thirds.” n t e gyeat civil Avar in America, the opinions of Surgeons appear to haA'e leeu lAidcd ; and the conclusion airived at seems to have been that, proA'ided e arp vessels and nerves Avere not injured, and the circumstances in which com-eyance not too nnfavourable, the chance of unrlo f u whether amputation were performed or an attempt , c idcd by the free use of antiseptics, to save the limli. But CA'cn in-34 GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. these circumstances Hamilton states that, although his experience in that great uarhas led him to the conclusion that in the upper tliird tlie life is least hazarded by aii attempt to saA'o the limb, in the middle third conservatism and imputation afford an equal chance, whilst in the lower third of the thigh the chances are in favoiu' ot amputation. This is a conclusion A'ory similar to that arri-\'ed at by British Siu’geons. 'l^Tien an attempt is made to save the limb, ill apjiaratus, the characteristic principle of which is continuous extension and counter-extension, Avith but few splints and bandages, should be used ; so the limb may be seciu’ely fixed in the plaster-of-Pai’is apparatus. 3. In gim-shot fractiu-es of the lonesof the leg, amputation becomes necessary if the tibial arteries be injured, or if the knee or ankle-joint be badly wounded. If the injmy be in the middle of the leg, at a distance from these joints, and jiroA’ided there be not longitudinal fissmlng of the bone leading into them, much may be done to save the limb, by the extraction of splinters, and the remoA^al of sharp and angular fragments of bone, the hmb being put up in the plaster-of-Paris apparatus. In such cases, the patient may recover A\dth a shortened but otherivise useful limb. 4. Gun-shot wounds of the foot, if perforating and splintering the tarsus, require amputation, either at or above the ankle. Those of the hand are of special interest fi’om their frequency, in consequence of the bursting of guns, or of powder-flask explosions. In these cases, however extensive the injury may be that is indicted upon the hand, fingers being bloum aAvay, the thumb throAvn back, and the metacarpal bones splintered, we must endeaA'oiu, if pos- sible, to save a portion of it, if it be only one or tu’o fingers ; and, owing to the gTcat reparatiA'e power possessed by the hand, avc shall often, in the worst- looking cases, be able to accomplish this. If the thumb, AAuth one finger as an opponent, can be preserved, it will be of more service to the patient than any artificial contrh’ance, hoAA'ever ingeniously made. It not unfr’equently happens that amputation may be required in the more adA’anced stages of gun-shot injmy, in consequence of mortification. In these circumstances, it must be practised Anthout delay, and Avithout AA’aiting for the line of separation. If, in consequence of long-continued suffering and dischai’ge, the patient’s health become gueatly deteriorated, and the limb remain an useless appendage, ampu- tation Avill at last be imperative. 0. Gun-shot injiuies of joints are necessarily most serious and fatal—the danger depending on the*size and complexity of the articulation, rather than on the extent of the injury. Wounds of any of the thi-ee large joints of the lower extremity are especially dangerous and fatal; those of the upper ex- tremity are more readily, and indeed connnoidy, recovered from. The fact of a joint being wounded is generally obA’ious enough from the direction taken by the ball, the comminution of the bones, and perhaps the escape of synoAia ; but a joint may be fatally injiued by the longitudinal siDhtting of the bone into it, although the bullet has not passed Avithin some inches of it. In bullet-wounds of joints, excision may be advantageously substituted for amputation in cases in which the soft parts are not too extcnsiAcly torn, the large nerves and A’essels are uninjured, and the shaft of the bone not too widely splintered, the mischief being chiefly confined to the articular ends. Bullet-Avounds of the head, neclo, or trochanters of the femur, splintering t leBULLET-WOUND OF KNEE-JOINT. Ijone into the articulation, are necessarily most serious. If they be left to |)alliati^•e treatment, the death of the patient may be eonsidered as almost dtable ; if amimtation at the hip be performed, tlie prospect is better ; and, . , , , , 1 _ - I, . 1 1 1 „ mu:„ ,—11 inevi .though desperate, the case must not be eonsidered as hopeless. This is Avell illustrated by the result of amputations in the great war of the American Rebellion (p. 105). In Primary amputations at the hip-joint for gun-shot injuiy, .the mortality was, according to one estimate, 94, according to another, and I think more coirect, 84 per cent. All Ijitermedkde amputations were fatal, the Secondary ones only at the rate of 77 per cent. If the shaft be not too much implicated, it is probable that the best hope lies in the excision of the splintered bone, and the careful removal of the loose fragments. This operation, origin- 4illy proposed by Guthrie, and first successfully performed by O’Leary in the LVimean Avar, presents the most reasonable, though but a slender, hope of safety ±0 the patient, and should accordingly be practised. With this Anew the wound must be laid freely open, loose fragments extracted, and the upper end of the bone detached, turned out, and sawn off. Of six cases in AAfrich this was done in the Crimea, one patient, O’Leary’s, recoA’ered. Bullet-Avounds of the Icnee-joint are amongst the most serious injiu’ies in .surgery; and this AALether the bones be much comminuted or not, ^u’OA’ided the epiphysis of the tibia or femiu’ be perforated, or the articulation be fairly traversed or even penetrated by the ball. Prior to the American AA’ar there AA’ere but scA'en cases in AA^hich excision of the knee had been done for gun-shot iujiuy—five in military, two in civil practice ; the two latter cases recovered, the other five died. In the American war the operation Avas done eleA'en times : in tAvo cases, one primary, the other secondary, recoA'ery took place ; nine deaths resulted, chiefly fr’om pyemia. In three cases in which the patella alone Avas excised, death ensued. During the late war the results of excision ot the knee, both primary and secondary, ha\'e been so uniformly bad that the ■operation for the futme Avill probably be abandoned in military surgery. The npeiation Avould be doubtless advisable in cases of gun-shot Avoiuids of the knee occiUTing in ciA'il practice, where every possible care and attention can be bestoAved ujAon the after-treatment, hygienic conditions, and diet of the patient; but AA'here this is impossible, as after a great battle, it is almost ■ceitainly fatal, contrasting most unfaA'ourably with primary amputation in the lower third of the thigh. When amputation is determined on, the operation requires to be performed early, not because the apparent injury may 3C A cry seA ere, or the mutilation of the limb so great as obviously and im- pciatiAely to call for inmiediate amputation, but because experience has shoAAii t at, unless the limb be remoA’ed at an early period, after-consequences of the most serious and fatal character aaiU to a certainty ensue. ExtensiA'c suppura- lon of the joint, deep and large abscesses burroAving amongst the muscles of e t igh, and consequent exhaustion of the patient by hectic, or his destruc- lon by pya3inia, ai’c the conditions that amputation, performed at an early s age, can alone^ avert. Tins necessity for early amputation in penetratino- u c -wounds of the knee-joint is recognised by all modern military Suro-eon^ u rie aiid Lamy in the French Avars, Esmarch and Stromeycr in the the campaign, and the Surgeons in the Crimea, all found that attempt to save a limb so injm-cd led to the sacrifice of the patient’s life236 GUX-SIIOT WOUNDS. Lullofc-wouuds of the anlch-joint do not necessarily x’eqnire ampixtation. If the bones be not too extensively comuiinnted, and more particularly if the posterior tibial artery and nerve have escaped injury, an attempt, and prolxably a successful one, may be made to save the limb ; the injuiy being treated on those principles ax Inch xviU be described in the chapters on Fractures and on Dislocations. In such cases extraction of fragments, and excision of the splinteicd ends, are necessary ; and modified operations, partial excision by means ol gouge, forceps, and Key’s savr, xviU be found more successful than the more systematic operations. If the large vessels and nerves hax'e been cut across, and the bones very extensively shattered, amputation xvill be the proper course to pursue. The shoulder, and more particularly the left shoulder, fr-om its advanced position in the act of firing, is peculiarly hable to gun-shot iujiuy ; the buUct either traversing the head of the humerus and lodging in it, or perhaps fr’actiuing some of the bony processes of the scapula in its immediate vicinity ; or, as in the case of common shot, or fragments of shells, carrying axvay the fleshy cushion of the deltoid muscle. It is especially in bullet-Avounds of the shoiilder and elboAV-joint, that conservative siugeiy has been most successful. In such cases, Avheu the bones are penetrated, and even shattered by a bullet, provided the main blood-vessels and nerves of the limb be not injm’ed, amputation xvill seldom be required ; and, indeed, it should be laid doAvu as a rule in siugeiy, that excision should be preferred to amputation ui all cases, Avhen the large blood-vessels and nerves are not xA’Oimded, or the soft parts too extensively disorganised. The Around haAdng been enlarged, loose spicula must be remoA’ed, and the sjDhntered and jagged ends of the fractrued bone saAvn smoothly off. If the bullet be still lodged in the head of the humerus, as in Fig. 95, the same coiuse should be adopted. It has been a question Avith Siugeons, Avhether excision or amputation shoidd be done AA'hen the upper end of the shaft of the humerus has been much splintered, Avith or Avithout penetration of the joint. In these cases the epiphysis is often luiinjiued. Guthrie adrised amputation ; brrt the result of the experience of the Avar in America has beerr that five or six irrehes of the shaft of the humerus may be removed^ Avith perfect safety, arrd that no good comes of leaving the rrnirrjrued epiphysis, which should also be excised. The results of excisiorr of the joints of the upper extremity are in the highest degree satisfactory. Thus Bauderrs states that he saved 13 out of 14 cases of excision of the shorrlder. According to Thorrrtorr, in the British army in the Crimea, the shorrlder Avas excised 12 times with 2 deaths ; the elbow in 17 cases, of which txA'o Avere fatal; and partially in 5 other cases, all of which were snccessfrrl. These resrrlts, Avhich reflect the highest credit on the skill of our army Srugeorrs, Avero more successfrrl than those that followed the amputation of correspondiirg parts. Of GO disarticulations at the shoulder, 19, or 31 per cerrt., Avere fixtal; and of 153 amputatiorrs of the ar-m, 29, or 19 per cent., died.

In the official report of the Surgeon-General of the United States army, of 280 cases of excision of the elbow in which the results are known, it is stated that 02 died, and that in 10 amputation became necessary. Of 210 primary excisions of the shoulder-joint death occun'ed in 50 ; and in 298 secondaiy excisions 115 cases were fatal, giOng a mean mortality of 32*48, against ?>9*44 for amputation at the shoulder, and 44*4 for cases treated on the exiiectant plan. In the Russian army, conservative sm*gery Avas also exten- sively practised ; and in it, according to Mouat and Wyatt’s report, of 20 cases ef excision of the elboAV, 15 recovered. The operation of Excision of large portions of the shaft of the humerus as well as of its head, Avas carried much further by the American military iSurgeons’ in the Avar of the Rebellion than had heretofore been done.

The question as to tho^ierwd at. which amputation oiujhtfo be formed after the infliction of gun-shot wounds, is one of great importance, and has given rise to much discussion among Surgeons. The older military Surgeons, Pare, Wiseman, .Ledran, Eanby, &c., taking a common-sense view of tlie question, advocated the removal of the hopelessly injured limb as soon as possible after the receipt of the injmy. Wiseman’s advice is to “ cut off the limb quickly, Avhile the soldier is heated and in mettle ; ” and this ad-sice has not been and cannot be improved upon. After the battle of Pontenoy, in the middle of the- last centiuy, professional opinion underwent a change upon this subject; and Faiu’e wrote a thesis, which obtained a prize of the French Academy of Surgery, recommending delay in amputating in certain cases. Hunter, Percy, and other Surgeons of repute, promulgated similar views ; until Bilguer, the Sm’geon-in-chief to the armies of Frederick the Great, went to the absmd and dangerous extent of condemning amputation entirely. These extreme opinions necessarily occasioned a reaction ; and the experience gained in the wars of the French Eevolution and of the Empire, has enabled Surgeons to settle this question definitely. It is more particularly through the laboins and observa- tions of John Bell, Larrey, Thomson, Guthrie, S. Cooper, and Heimen, that the necessity of having recomse to immediate amputation in all cases of gun- shot injmy requiring this operation has been fully recognised, and the truth of Wiseman’s ad-sIce has been re-established. In determining this point we must be guided, partly by surgical experience of the result of such cases when left to nature, and partly by an appeal to facts. In appeahng to experience Ave must, to use the forcible language of Sir Charles. Bell, contemplate what Avill be the condition of the parts in twelve hours, in six days, and in three months. “ In tweh’e horns the infiammation, pain, and tension of the whole limb, the inflamed countenance, the brilliant eye, the- sleepless and restless condition, declare the impression the injmy is making on the limb and on the constitutional powers. In six days, the limb from the- gToin to the toe, or from the shoulder to the finger, is swollen to half the size: of the body ; a Afiolent phlegmonous inflammation pervades the whole ; serous effusion has taken place in the whole limb ; and abscesses are forming in the oreat beds of cellular textme throughout the vfrole extent of the extremity. In three months, if the patient have labom-ed through the agony, the bones are carious ; the abscesses are interminable sinuses ; the limb is imdermmed and everyAvhere unsound ; and the constitutional strength ebbs to the lowest (^0crx*00 , If we appeal to facts, we shaU find that of 300 secondary amputations reported by Fame, after the battle of Fontenoy, only thirty were successful; whereas Larrey saved three-fourths of his primary amputations Napoleonic Avars. In the Peninsular war, the comparative loss after secondary amputations of the upper extremity Avas, to that folloAving the primary as 3ve to one ; and of tlie loAver extremity, the loss after secondary amputation vTs three times as gi-eat as after primary. Hming the siege ot Sebastopol,239 TIME FOR AMPUTATION. among 80,000 wounded Eussians there were 3000 amputations. Of the primary amputations of the upper extremity, leg, and foot, about one-half, and of the lower and middle third of the thigh, about one-third recovered ; but of all the secondaiy amputations more than tAVO-thirds died. Primary amputa- tion, therefore, should ahvays, Avhen practicable, be performed in preference to secondary. But hoAV soon after the infliction of the injury should it be practised ? It is the opinion of some Surgeons that there is often an interval betAveen the infliction of the injury and the superA'ention of the shock to the system, in which the limb may more advantageously be removed. Should the depression of “ shock ” haA'e come on, it then becomes a question whether immediate amputation should be practised, or the removal of the limb delayed until reaction sets in. On this point it is obA'iously difficult to lay doAvn any A'ery definite rule ; but it may, I think, be stated generally as the result of the experience of the best army Surgeons, that, if the shock be not A'ery intense, the limb may, under chloroform, be safely removed. Should the prostration be excessiA'e, and there be reason to fear the possibihty of internal injury, it aauU be Aviser to delay operation. But if an unsuccessful attempt at the preservation of the limb be made, and if occasion for its subsequent remoA'al should arise, the Sm-geon must wait until suppmation has set in before he operates, the period of acute inflammatory action being allowed to pass by. The cases that most commonly require secondary amputation are those in Avhich traumatic gangi-ene has set in ; here the limb must always be remoA'ed without delay, in accordance AAuth the principles laid down in speaking of this subject in reference to contused wounds. If profuse hmmorrhage from the Avound occiu, and do not admit of suppression by the ordinary means, secondary amputation may become necessary. So, also, Avhen the bones do not unite, the patient being worn out by discharges and the irritation of necrosis and caries, and left Avith a wasted, shattered, and useless limb, its removal is the only means of saving life. The great mortahty after secondary amputation in military practice is, in great measiue, owing to the unfavourable hygienic conditions to which the Avoimdcd soldier is usually exposed fr-om over-crowding and want of necessary appliances. He is thus rendered peculiarly liable to the occimence of pyiemia, septiciemia, and hospital gangrene. Ihe nature and treatment of. gun-shot injuries of special regions, as of the head, chest, and abdomen, Avill be considered in the Chapters devoted to the description of Injuries of those parts.POISONED WOUNDS. 240 CHAPTEE XI. POISONED WOUNDS. A VERY important variety of woimcl is that in which a poison is introduced. The most serious poisoned wounds are those inflicted by the stings of insects, the bites of snakes or of rabid animals, and injmics received in dissection. BTINGS OF INSECTS. Stings of Insects, as of bees, wasps, mosquitoes, gnats, &c., though painful, seldom j)roduce any serious inconvenience ; yet occasionally they may 'do so, and may even prove fatal, by inducing erysipelas in some imhealthy ■constitutions, or by giving rise to intense in'itation from the multiplicity of the stings, as when bees in great nimrbers swarm upon and sting a person ; or they may be dangerous in consequence of the natine of the part that is stung, ns the eye, or the interior of the mouth, or pharynx, as has happened from swallowing a bee in a piece of honeycomb. Mosquito-bites are pecuharly irritating, and when numerous poison the blood, producing nervous depression nnd great febrile irritation. The venom of a mosquito is very powerful, weight for weight probably more so than that of the rattle-snake. The bites ■of some insects, as scorpions, or the tarantula in Italy, give rise to more serious and even fatal distmbance. A pecuhar tinin of nervous phenomena is said to follow the bite of the tarantula, hence called “ tarantismus ; ” a disease that is generally stated to be peculiarly influenced by music, though this has been denied by Gozzo. Treatment.—In the treatment of stings of insects the appheation of ■cooling lotions, of a cold poultice, or rubbing the pai-t with ohve-oil, will be found the most useful means of allaying initation. In some cases, more ■especially in mosquito-bites, touching the part stung •with strong hquor ammonias or potassas gives relief, if applied at once. In the case of stings fr’om wasps or bees, it should be ascertained that the sting has not been left in the wound. If so, it must be extracted, and the alkah ajsplied. SNAKE-BITES. Snake-bites are seldom fatal in England ; venomous reptiles, such as the •viper and adder, not possessing a sufficiently energetic poison to destroy a healthy adult, though they might possibly kill a child or a very weak and delicate person. These reptiles are said to be most active in warm weather and dining the season of procreation. Their hites are of coinse most dano-erous if inflicted through a vein or glandular part, or near the centre ot the circulation, or about the neck and face. In tropical comitnes the bite of the rattle-snake, of the cobra di capello, the puff-adder, or the tobacco-pipe snake, is often fatal. The number of persons who are annually killed by snake-bites in those parts of India alone from which retimis are prociinffile amoimts to about 12,000, or about 1 m every 5000 of the inhabitants ; and it occasionally happens even in this coimtry,that the Sm-geon has an opportunity of seeing wounds inflicted by these fearful reptiles in menageries, ihiis.241 EFFECTS OF SNAKE-POISON. Sir E. Home has recorded a hxfcal case of rattle-snake bite occurring in England. A similar instance has been seen at St. George’s Hospital, and another in Pai-is, in showmen. The most remarkable case of this kind x\'ith which I am acquainted occniTed some years ago at the University College Hospital, and afforded an oixportnnity, rare in this country, of -witnessing the effects of the bite of a cobra di capcllo. The patient, a keeper at the Zoological Gai’dens, was bitten in the bridge of the nose, the poison-fang ha\iug 'apparently J3enetrated the angular vein. When brought to the hospital, about half an horn- after the accident, he was apparently dying, being miable to speak, swallow, or support himself; the i^upils were dilated, the face li-\id, the heart’s action feeble, and he was scarcely conscious. After death, which took place in little more than an hour from the time of the infliction of the Avonnd, the veins of the brain and the cerebral sinuses were found con- gested -Ruth blood, as were also the lungs to an immense extent, and the solid abdominal Uscera. The right cavities of the heart were loaded with dark blood, the left being empty; indeed, the phenomena of asphyxia were strik- ingly marked. In this case, death would appear to have resulted fr-om the poison paralysing the medulla oblongata, and those portions of the nervous system which are concerned in carrying on respiration, at the same time that the blood was disorganised by the action of the virus. Effects of Sj^ake-poisoj^.—The venom of the cobra has been found to consist of an albuminous fluid of acid reaction, holding cells in suspension. When given internally, or applied to the conjunctiva, it fails to kill. Snake- poison, when introduced into the system tln-ough a bite or punctiu-e, may prove injiuions or kill, either by its primaiy and direct depressing influence on the nervous system, somewhat resembling that produced by some narcotic poisons ; or, secondarily, and more remotely, by exciting severe diffuse inflam- mation of the areolar tissue of the limb or part. The intensity of its effects depends m some measiwe upon the \-igom- of the animal inflicting the wound; one that has been compelled to bite frequently has no longer the destructive power which it had when fr’esh. The first mode of death occurs only when the poison is either very powerful, or the aniinal bitten small. Thus the poison of the tobacco-pipe snake is said to be so vin-dent, that it will kill a full-gTown man in less than a quarter of an horn-. The rattle-snake, and the cobra di capello, wiU kill a small animal in the com-se of a few seconds ; and a man, bitten some years ago by a rattle- snake m Paiis, died in nine hoiu-s; the cobra bite just related was fatal in little more than one hour ; and the Austrahan tiger-snake wiU kill in less than twenty-four hom's. venomous and death is not speedy, the poison excites diffuse inflammation and suppm-ation of the areolar tissue of the limb utten. This is a very common consequence of the bite of the adder and tlic viper m this country. It may also occur after bites by the laro-cr ophiclia Thus, 111 the case which occim-ed in St. George’s Hospital, the patient died on the eighteenth day after the bite of a rattle-snake, with lai-o-e of'thThmb of the areolar tissue Phe Symptoms occurring after VOL. I. a poisonous snake-bite consist in great BPOISONED WOUNDS. 242 depression and ostration of the system, a feeble and intermittent pulse, dilated pupils, usually slight delirium, indistinctness of speech, at times complete aphasia, speedy stupor, insensibility, and death. The pain is burning and lancinating, whilst the part bitten swells and becomes livid in a few hours; and if the patient smwive sufficiently long, diffuse inflammation and gangrene occim in its neighbomhood; involuntary evaciiatious take place ; asthenic symptoms set in, which may eventually terminate fatally, or end slowly, and after a lapse of tune, in the recovery of the patient, whose health may long suffer seriously from the effects of the accident. Treatment.—This is local and general. The Local Treatment can only be fulfilled with success when the patient is seen immediately after the accident, as the absorption of the poison is very rapid. It presents two great indications : 1, to prevent the absorption of the poison into the system; and 2, to treat the diffuse inflammation and sloughing that may subsequently occur. The first indication may be fulfilled by tying a ligatme so tightly round the limb at a little distance above the injimed part, as to an-est all circulation thi-ough it. In this way the absoi-ption of the poison may be prevented ; the woimd should then be freely cauterised mth a red-hot iron or cinder, or better still, excised, and a cupping-glass applied over the cut surface, so as to withdiw the blood in the neighbomfrood which may have become contaminated by the poison. If a cupping-glass be not at hand, or if the part bitten be so situated as not to admit of its application, there can be no objection to the employment of suction by the mouth after free excision ; the poison not being absorbed by an luibroken mucous membrane. In using suction, the mouth should be rinsed with brandy. With the view of lessening the swelling, tension, and pain of the limb, frictions nith olive oil are said to be advantageous. After diffuse inflammation has set in, this must be treated on general principles—by fomentations and free incisiou. The Constitutional Treatment consists in the early and free administra- tion of the most powerful stimulants, with the mew of combating the depression that exists. For this pinpose, brandy, wine, ammonia, or ether must be freely given. The eau de /wee—which enjoys a high reputation in some tropical coiuitries—owes its efficacy to the ammonia which it contains. ^ Should (frowsi- ness come on, the patient must be made to walk about; and artificial respiration with o-alvanism may be resorted to as a last means of maintaining life until the effects of the stimulants may overcome those of the poison. Enforced exercise —the patient being made to run for some distance behind a canlage driven at a steady pace—is another means of keeping up the respiration, while the sweat- iim aids in the elimination of the poison. Large doses of arsemc have been recommended as a land of specific, and the “ Tanjore piU,” a celebrated Iiffiian remedy, owes its activity to this mineral; but care must, of comse, taken in administering this, lest the remedy prove as fatal as the mjmy for which it is administered. Halford, of Melbourne, has used, in cases of bite by the -brown snake,” a very venomous M, whose bite is nearly alwa^^ injection of strong solution of ammonia, dduted with tvuce of ^ iii a superficial ?ein, such as the radial. Fifteen or thirty minims me th on in, and repeated according to circumstances. The effect is immediate rousing of the patient from his stupor. Sir Joseph Fayiei, hov ev ,243 HYDROPHOBIA. finds tliafc this remedy has no jDower in cases of cobra bite, or as an antidote to the poison of Indian serpents, -whateTer its efficacy may be in counteracting the deadly effects of those of the Australian species. As liquor potass® decom- poses the A'irus into a sediment and supernatant fluid, both of Avhich are inno- cuous, it might be supposed that it would act as a true antidote, but it has not been foimd to do so Avhen iiijectcd into the Iffood of Ijitten animals. The difficulty Avith respect to antidotes for snake-poisoning apj>ears to con- sist in the application rather than in the possibility of the discoA'ery of one. TheA'enom of a snake is at once injected into the blood of the animal bitten, is caiTied AAuth the circulation to the nen'ous centre, decomposing the fluid that couA-eys it, so that it has the start of any antidote than can possibly be applied in a suflicient time to prerent its direct toxic effects on the system. It is difficult to understand hoAV an antidote could act unless it AA®re injected into the veins simultaneously Avith the introduction of the snake-poison into the blood. Unless a surgeon be at hand prepared to do this at the moment, as in the case of an animal bitten for experiment, too much time Avould be lost to render the coiuiteraction of a poison possible. And it is evident that di-ugs or substances SAvalloAved AAuth the vieAv of acting as antidotes could not be absorbed from the stomach in time to be efficacious. BITES OF RABID ANIMALS : HYDROPHOBIA. Bites of rabid animals giA'e rise to the disease so much and so justly dreaded, but fortunately seldom seen in man in this country. Hydrophobia. This disease cannot originate de novo in man, but invariably occurs iu him and most commoidy in the loAver animals, as the result of inoculation. Animals of the canine and fehne species are most subject to it; especially the dog, the Avolf, the fox, the jackal, and the cat. It has not, I beheve, been observed in hons or tigers, or in the larger feline animals. Does rabies ever originate de novo in annuals ? Most veterinary simgeons are of opinion that it does not, but is invariably the result of contagion. If it e\®r do arise spontaneously, its causes are very obscure. But it certainly appears to be subject to epidemic A'anations. In some years hydi’ophobia is never heard of—in others it is very rife. Hychophobia has foUoAved the bite of an animal that has shoAvn no signs of rabies-one of those many inexphcable occun-ences in this singular disease. It has been attributed to the influence of season, being most common in the early spring months ; thus Eckel found it most common in dogs iu February and May. Want of water, sudden changes from heat to cold, bad food, and unsatisfied sexual desire, have also each been assigned as causes of its occinrence m animals, men we inquire into the operation of these alleged causes, we ai 0 scover any direct and positive connection betAveen any one of them and rabies. Mhth regard to the influence of heat and want of water, it would appear that in those countries in Avhich animals of the canine and feline races Me most exposed to these conditions, hydrophobia is unknoAAui. Thus Mr. ^ oiioAan, Avho has resided and travelled for many years in Central Afi-ica 1 onus me that, 111 the deserts of that country, Avhere Avater is so scarce that man and beast often die ot thhnt, lions are always to be Cd andUo casionally seen going about 111 famihes, whilst hyenas, jackals, and wild doo-s ‘ most munerous, and yet hydrophobia is unkiioAvn. Barrow, a scientific244 POISONED WOUNDS. and observant traveller, makes a similar statement, viz., that hydrophobia cannot proceed from thirst and heat, as it is unknown in Egypt, the West India Islands, and some other tropical parts. The theory of hydrophobia arising from nngratified sexual desire appears to be equally untenable. It is not uncommon in Africa, Mr. Donovan says, for wolves, jackals, and wild dogs to prowl about mad with heat; and in this state they are most dangerous, so much so that domesticated dogs instinctively shun them, but there is no evidence of their ever having communicated hydrophobia. Having been told that no bitches were allowed in Sark, I A^note to Dr. Cockridge of that Island to inquire if this were the fact, and if so, whether hydi-ophobia were preva- lent there. He informed me that there were no bitches in the island, and that dogs were very numerous, but that no case of hydrophobia had, to his knowledge, ever occiuTed there, and that the clergyman, who had had thirty years’ experience of the island, had never heard of a case of that disease. Dogs more frequently become rabid than bitches; thus, of a hundred and forty-one cases collected by Eckel, only fifteen occmred in bitches ; and amongst dogs it is most common in those of a mongrel breed, seldom affecting those that are of pm-e blood, or that have been castrated. In man, hydrophobia occm’s either fi'om the bite of a dog known to be rabid, or by the hand or face of the master whilst caressing the animal being bitten, or from a raw smface, as a crack in the lip, being licked by an animal iU of rabies, but in whom the characteristic symptoms have not developed themselves.* But it is important to knoAV that the bite of a rabid animal is by no means certain to occasion hydrophobia. In fact, the vast majority of people who are bitten by animals in a state of rabies do not take the disease. Thus Hunter and Yaughan (Halford) state that only one out of twenty or thirty Avho are bitten by rabid dogs becomes hydrophobic. But the bite of a rabid wolf is far more dangerous than that of a mad dog. Watson states that of 114 persons bitten by rabid wolves, 67 died of hydrophobia. The bite of a rabid cat is also more dangerous than that of a dog. The fact is that the dog usually bites at the leo'S, and thus when he inflicts a wound, it is through clothing, by Avhich his teeth are wdped and the saliva arrested, and thus the wound escapes inocula- tion. Wolves and cats, on the other hand, ahvays fly at naked parts of the body as the face or throat; hence the greater danger of their bites. But maldno- all allowance for the mechanical action of clothing in preventing- inoculation of the part bitten, there is, I think, good reason to beheve that there is a «-reat difference in the susceptibility of different individuals to the noison of rabies. Eor it is an undoubted fact that veterinary Smgeons and others have often been bitten in an imcovered hand by rabid dogs, and yet have escaped the disease. EUiotson mentions the cases of two sisters ivho were both bitten in the face by the same rabid dog. The fii-st escaped the second died of hydi-ophobia. White, of Brighton, disbelieving in the contagioii of the disease, iiioculated himself Avith the saliva of a rabid dog Anth impunity. There is this important difference between the poisonous impregiiatiou of the wolnd b^the U a rabid dog and of a snake. In the case of the dog the poison is only adherent to the tooth, and hence, if this be wiped in its passage through clothing, the bite is rendered innocuous. In the case of the snake, ae poison is projected through the hollow fang, and hence, Avherever thatSYMPTOMS OF HYDROPHOBIA. 245 enters, however cleanly its exterior may be wiped, this drop of poison is injected into the parts at the extreme point of penetration. A snake that bites through a gaiter or glove, would, therefore, inflict as deadly a womid as if the unprotected foot or hand were struck by the fang ; whereas the tooth of the rabid dog would be wiped, and the bite be harmless. The period that intervenes between the Ihte and the occiuTence of the disease is usually considerable. Meade has related the case of a lady who had the disease fifteen months after the bite ; and flayer of St. Petersbiu'gh that of a young man who died of hydrophobia twenty-six months after being bitten. Elliotson says that the average time that elapses between the injury and the symptoms is from six weeks to three months. In the case of the Duke of Kichmond, who was bitten by a tame fox, the disease did not develop itself until between six and seven weeks after the injury. Writers, however, in stating that six, seven, twelve, and even fifteen years have intervened between the infliction of the wound and the manifestation of the symptoms, have e^•idently committed an exaggeration or fallen into eiTor, having proljably con- founded with hydrophobia other nervous affections that closely resemble it. SYMFrovrs.—The woimd has generally cicatrised long before any symptoms of hydrophobia declare themseh'es ; and no peculiar a|3j)earance is presented by the scar. Shooting pains, twitching and itching sensations have, however, occasionally been experienced in the site of the wound before the suj)er- vention of the attack ; and it is probable that in aU cases some process ana- logous to a zymotic action takes place within it before the disease comes on. The precise natm-e of this requires to be elucidated by further observation. The symptoms are usually ushered in for two or three days (according to Periy for five or six) by some antecedent phenomena, consisting of giddiness, chills, and heats, and a general feeling of discomfort. In some cases vesicles under the tongue have been observed. The more special symptoms never manifest themselves imtil the disease is fairly established ; they consist essen- tially in violent and repeated commlsive movements of a reflex character, induced by vailous external influences acting on the smfface of the body or on the fauces, or by mental impressions ; and they speedily end in exhaustion and death. The special symptoms consist of: 1, Spasmodic Affection of the Muscles of Deglutition and Eespiration; 2, Extreme Sensibihty of the Siuface and of the Senses ; and 3, Excessive Mental Terror and Agitation. 1. In consequence of the Spasmodic Affection of the Muscles of Deglutition, the act of swallowing commonly excites convulsions ; hence the p<itient experiences a horror of all liquids ; and, in attempting to chink, gulps owji the fluid with a strong mental effort. In some cases, solids give rise to e^ same difficulty in deglutition as liquids ; but occasionally, though rarely patients have been kno^vn to swaUow perfectly well throughout the disease’. swallowng is certainly 03ving to an excessive sensibility about e p arjnx and throat, in consequence of which every effort at deglutition m uces violent reflex convulsive movements in aU the muscles and narts supplied by the pneumogastric nerve.

This catch is due to the spasmodic descent of the diaphragm, and gives rise to severe pain at the pit of the stomach, or to a feeling of suffocation and a return of tlie convulsions. In consequence of this spasm ot the diaphragm, the patient makes from time to time a loud hiccuping noise, which has been likened to the bark of a dog. 2. Excessive Sensibility of the Cutaneoirs Uerves, and of some of the Nerves of Special Sense, is characteristic of hydrophobia. The cutaneous nciTOs become so sensitive that a blast of cold air, the rustling of the l^ed- clothes, the slightest touch of or movement on the skin, will bring on convul- sions. The nerves of sense become equally excitable, so that a sudden flash of light before the eyes, as the reflection of the sun from a looking-glass, or a sudden noise, as the slamming of a door, will produce the same effect. The noise produced by liquids being pom-ed fr-om one vessel to another is peculiarly distressing to the patient ; and EUiotson mentions a case in which a patient with hydi’ophobia was thrown into ^dolent agitation by hearing the dresser who sat up with him void mine. The sufferings and convidsions that patients experience when they attempt to drink, appeal- to be owing to excessive sensi- bility of the nerves of the mouth and pharynx, and the recollection of these sufferings makes them afraid to repeat the attempt; hence the fear of hquids fr-om which the disease derives its name. 3. One of the earliest symptoms, and one of the most persistent, is extreme Mental Agitation and Terror, a vague sense of dread and horror at the im- pending fate. Spectral illusions sometimes occm-, the patient supposing himself to be sm-romided by animals, by horrid forms, or by gajiing, ghastly, and grinning countenances, by flies or wasps. The first symptoms in the Duke of Eichmond’s case was, that he fancied some poplar-trees opposite his bedroom window to be men looking in. These delusions may alternate with fits of delirium, terror, and fr-enzy. In these it is said that the patient barks like a dog, and endeavom’s to bite ; but this is a popular error—the pretended bai-k is merely the catch in breathing, and the attempt to bite is nothing but move- ments of the tongue and mouth induced by the viscid and ropy saliva. Occasionally the symptoms subside completely before death ; the increased sensibility of the surface disappearing, the mental agitation or delusion being removed, and deglutition and respiration being quietly performed. Thus, j Latham relates the case of a man laboiu-ing under this disease, who sat up | quietly in bed and drank a pint of porter half an horn- before he died. The Sm-geon is sometimes asked to give an opinion as to the condition of a dog that has bitten a person, and which is suspected of being- mad. The following description of the symptoms of Rabies in the Dog, by Dr. Bm-don Sanderson, will aid him in coming to a conclusion on these points. “The premonitory indications of rabies in a dog are derived ahnost entirely from the observation of changes in its demeanour ; consequently, I although they may be too trifling to be noticed by a casual observer, they are fortunately sufficiently striking to arrest the attention of any one who is about a dog, and is familiar with its habits and individual pecuharities. “ A dog about to become rabid loses its natiu-al livehness. It mojies about as if preoccupied or apprehensive, and seeks to vuthch-aw into dark cornei-s. From the first there is usually a foreshadowing of that most constaut symptomSYMPTOMS OF RABIES IN DOG. 247 of the disease—depraved appetite. Mad dogs not only devour filth and rubbish of every kind vdth avidity, but even their own excrement—often im- mediately after it has been passed. Indications of this tendency appear early, and arc more than suspicious. “Along with this peculiai-ity of behavioim it is of equal importance to notice that an Mected dog, from the fii’st, snaps at other dogs ivithout provocation. This snappishuess in most dogs is very striking. If a dog previously known to have no such hahit, snaps indiscriminately at the first dog it meets in the yard or in the street, it is probably not safe. “ So far I have had in mind chiefly what is to be observed in dogs tied up or at home. A dog which is at large is also to be recognised as in a dangerous state by its demeanour. A healthy dog in its progress along a street or else- where shows at every step that its attention is awake to the sights and sounds which it encounters. The rabid dog, on the contrary, goes sullenly and im- observantly forwards, and is not diverted by objects obviously likely to attract it. This statement, however, is subject to the important exception akeady refen-ed to, that it is excited both by the sight and sound of an animal of its own species. “ Of the symptoms which accompany the final stage of the disease, the most important and characteristic are those which relate to the organs in which it localises itself—the mouth and throat. Attention is often di’awn to the con- dition of the mouth in ail animal supposed to be healthy, by the observation that it tries to scratch the corners of its mouth, as if attempting to get rid of the ropy mucus which is seen to be discharged from it. In dogs that are tied up, it is noticeable that the bark has entirely lost its ring, and acqiures a pecuhar hoarseness, which can be recognized even by the most unobservant. As the disease progresses the discharge increases, the lower jaw hangs as if paralysed, and the animal has evident difficulty in swaUowing. Along with this_there is often loss of power of the hind hmbs. If now the dog be watched, the pecuharities of behaviom- which have been aheady noticed are seen to present themselves in a much more marked degree than before. It is observed, fii’st, that it is subject to paroxysms of excitement, in which it makes often- repeated efforts to bite or gnaw aU objects (such as woodwork, straw, &c.) within its reach, while at the same time it continues to exhibit the tendency already mentioned to devoiu’ its own excrement; and, secondly, even dining the remissions its excitement is at once renewed by the sight or spund of another dog. “ It may be well to note that the disease ocem’s at all seasons, that the mad dpg continues to recognize its master and to manifest pleasme when kindly spoken to, that it does not shun water, and that in many cases fr'om first to last that ivild fury which is commonly supposed to belong to the disease, is conspicuously absent.” Prognosis.—I am not acquainted with any case of recovery from hydro- phobia, after the disease has fairly set in. It cannot, however, be pronounced to be absolutely and inevitably fatal; for Eadchffe states that, of 109 authen- tic cases, recovery took place in 14. The disease may prove fatal in foin-and- twenty hours, or life may be prolonged for six or seven days ; death generally occurring from the second to the fourth day, apparently fr-om exhaustion.24S TOISONED WOUNDS. Pai'holog'^ . Ihc appearances found after death throAV no light ■whatever upon the disease, iunl indeed may often he supposed to bo simply the effects of the spasmodic irritation. The tongue, the fauces, the throat, the glottis, and the larynx, the stomach and cesophagus, the brain, the medulla oblongata, and spinal cold, have all been found congested and inflamed; there is nothing, however, in the appearances presented by those parts that affords a clue to the true nature of this inscrutable and terrible malady. In fact, cverthing con- nected Avith hydrophobia is at present in\'olvod in complete obscurity. We neither know what occasions rabies in the dog, nor in Avhat consists the change in his secretions, that enables him to transmit the disease to man. Equally obscure are the processes that are going on at the seat of the wound or in the constitution generally, dm-ing the period that intervenes betiveen the infliction of the bite and the deA'elopmeut of the disease ; and lastly, pathological research has liitherto failed to throw the faintest glimmer of light on the natime of the changes which the neiwous system undergoes, and w^hich occasion the chacteristic phenomena of hydrophobia. Treatment.—This must be principally p-eventive and piUiakm. We can- not speak of curative treatment of hydrophobia ; for, after the disease has once set in, the utmost that can be done -will not accomplish more than to lessen the patient’s sufferings, and stay for a few horn’s the inevitably fatal termination. When a person is bitten by a rabid dog, or even by one that is reasonably nqiposed to be so, the Siu’geon should always adopt energetic means to save tno I atient from the invasion of a disease that is necessarily fatal. In haAdug recoiu’se to preventive treatment, it shoidd be borne in mind that the larger proportion of persons actually bitten by rabid animals do not fall victims to hydrophobia ; the probability of the occiuTence of the disease depending partly upon the animal that bites, and partly upon whether the bite is inflicted on the naked or on the clothed part of the body, and possibly also on individual sus- ceptibility to the disease as has affeady been stated. It is in consequence of this small proportion of persons taking the disease out of the total number bitten, that so many popular remedies and superstitions haA'e obtained an mi- merited reputation for preventing the disease. The only preventiA'e means that can be trusted to by a Surgeon, are excision and caustic. Excision of the part bitten should be carefuUy and freely j)erformed, no half measures being had recoiu’se to. Hence it is better to remove too much of a comparatively unimportant tissue or part, than to allow the sufferer to run any risk of falling a victim to the fatal disease. In order to excise eA'ery part that has been touched by the tooth, the Singeon, after washing the wound and con- tiguous surface Avith strong carbolic acid lotion, should make a circle with ink, or tinctiu’e of iodine, completely round the injimed part. He must then pass a probe to the bottom of the Avound, and excise the whole by scooping out a conical piece of the tissues, taking care to go beyond the fiu’thest limit to Avhich the probe is passed. If there be any doubt of the remoA'al of the whole of the injiu-ed parts, potassa fusa should be applied. If the lip be bitten thi-ough, a portion should be cut out, and the AVOund brought together, as in hai-e-lip operations ; if a finger be injured, it should be amputated. hen the AA^omid is so situated that excision cannot readily be perfoi’med, potassa fusa, or strong nitric acid, or nitrate of sih'er, as recommended by Youatt, should be freely249 BUiSECTWX- jro UXDS. applied to cvciy corner of it. If the wound liavc already cicatrised, the bitten 2>art should be excised at any time after the injury, provided the dog is known to have been mad, or to have become so afterwards ; for it is not improbable that, in the cases where the disease has occiuTed at a remote period, it has been dependent upon, or connected with, some peculiar action set up in the wound, which might possibly be averted by the removal of the cicatrix. I forbear to speak of any other means of constitutional preventive treatment, as I consider them utterly undesei”\dng of confidence. After the disease has once set in, nothing can be done but to spnptoms and to prolong life. Every possible remedy that the ingenuity of man coidd de'^ise, from Avarm water to Aiper- and ticuna-poison, has been tried, and been found utterly useless. The only plan of treatment that holds out a hope of eventual success, and AA^hich, AA”hether it succeed or not in curing the patient, at all eA'euts mitigates his sufferings, is that Avhich has been re- commended by Marshall Hall and Todd. It consists, in the first jplace, in remoA-ing all external in-itation, Avhether mental or bodily ; putting the patient in a darkened room, as much remoA'ed as possible from aU noise and the intrusive curiosity of strangers, and siuTounding his bed AAdth gauze cm’tains or screens, so as to jirevent the distimbing influence even of a draught of cold air. ]\[easures must then be adopted to lessen the excitabihty of the spinal cord : this may be done most efficiently, as Todd suggests, by the aj)phcation of ice in a piece of gut laid along the whole length of the S23ine, or by means of a sj)inal ice-bag. Lastly, the Sm-geon must bear in mind that he has to treat an ex- hausting disease, azid that he must consequently sujDjDort the jzatient by AAune, beef-tea, and such nourishment as can be taken. WOUNDS WITH INOCULATION OF DECOMPOSING ANIMAL MATTER.* The majority of Avoimds of this character are not dangerous. Every student of anatomy fr-equently punctures and cuts himself in dissecting, but Ave laiely see any ill effects from these injiuies. In some cases, however, the inost serious results, terminating in permanently imjzaired health, or even m death,^ ensue. The result depends quite as much on the state of health of the peisoii injined, as on the condition of the body from which the jAoison is received. If the health be broken by any cause, whether excess of study or dissipation, or over-fatigue in professional work, very serious effects may follow, Av 1C AAOuld not occur if the patient had the resisting power of a somid and strong constitution. Causes.—The deleterious influence exercised by the dead body, human or bnite may be attributed to three different causes : 1, the ordinary Irritation of c ^ Inoculation of Putrid Matter ; or, 3, Introduction of a Specific Septic Virus into the system. I think it probable that each of these causes may exercise a distinct influence, but that the worst effects of dissection- wounds are dependent on the inoculation of a peculiar and specific Aims. 1. lhat ill effects sometimes result from the simple Irritation of the ^‘^ct that mere scratches or punctiucs with feBlmters of wood, or other substances free fr-om an actual poison, gixe rise to » Sec also Cliaptfr XXXl-Sorticn'ii.ia.POISONED WOUNDS. 250 considerable local disturbance in certain states of the constitution; so also those operatioii and disseetion-wounds which are ragged and torn, such as are made by sj)icida of bone or the teeth of a saw, arc peculiarly troublesome. 2. Putrescent Matters are always injiuious when introduced into the animal economy ; but at the same time it is a remarkable fact, that the worst eifects ot dissection-wounds have resulted from those received before putrefaction had set in, and that the most dangerous woimds more commonly occiu’ in 2^ost mortem inspections made a few hoiu’s after death, than in dissecting-room investigations on parts in an advanced stage of decomposition. 3. That the worst forms of dissection-wounds are dependent upon a Specific Septic Virus, is evident from the fact that it is especially after death from certain diseases, particularly those of an erysipelatous or i^ytemic type, that these consequences ensue. Most danger is to be apprehended from punctiu-cs receh'ed from the bodies of those who die of erysipelas, phlebitis, pyaemia, and the diffuse forms of peritonitis following partmition or the operation for hernia. And it is very important to remember that putrefaction is by no means neces- sary for this. The greatest danger exists before putrefaction sets in. A few hoiu-s after death, whilst apparently still quite fresh, the body is in the highest degree infectious and dangerous ; and I think that advanced putrefaction rather lessens than increases the danger. Indeed, the septic influence in these cases continues after death to be capable of producing in the living who are inocu- lated with it, a distinct affection of the nature of septsemia. Of aU these influ- ences, that which is generated by hernial or puerperal peritonitis is by far the most noxious. The acrid fluid which accumulates in the peritoneum when that structine is attacked by diffuse inflammation of the kinds just mentioned, appears to exercise a specifleaUy injurious influence. I beheve it to be im- possible to immerse the hand into it with impmiity if there shoifld happen to be a scratch, pmictine, or abraded surface of any kind on one of the Angers. Inoculation would, under such circumstances, ine'^dtably ensue, followed by diffuse inflammation to a gveater or less extent. It is, however, by no means necessary for ])ost mortem infection, that there be an abraded or broken surface through which the inoculated matter may be introduced into the system. Imbibition may take place through the unbroken cuticle ; and not unfrequently it is through the medium of the hair-foUicles that the septic poison enters. In the graphic account given by Sir James Paget of his own case, the septic influence is stated to have been absorbed through the unbroken cuticle of the hand immersed in pyeemic pleinitic effusion. I have known poisoning through the hair-follicles of the back of the hand to happen to another very distinguished member of oin profession. In other cases, again, infection appears to have taken place by absorption under the senulunai fold of skin at the base of the nail. That the poisonous influence fr-om the bodies oi persons who have died of septic diseases is transmissible to othei s by contact oi infection, cannot be denied ; and acconcheins and operating Smgeons should abstain as carefully as possible from performing post mortem examinations on patients dying from such diseases, lest the poisonous influence be canied to an excite similar morbid action in their own patients. Symptoms.—From what has been stated above, it would ap^iear that theie are two distinct kinds of mischief resulting from dissection-v ounds.SYMPT02IS OF DISSECTION-WOUNDS. 251 The milder form proceeds from the simple in-itation of a scratch in a broken constitution, or from the mocnlation of non-specific putrescent matter. The pnnctnred part becomes painful, hot, and throbbing, in from twelve to twenty-fonr hours after the injury; the finger swells and inflames, the absorbents of the aim are perhaps affected, and the glands in the axilla become enlarged. There is general febrile distiu-banee, ushered in by rigors and a feeling of depression and often intense headache ; suppuration takes place about the pnnetm-e, and also, perhaps, in the inflamed glands, the case presenting the ordinaiy characters of ivhitlow with inflammation of the absorbents. In the more severe form of dissection-woimd, the patient is seized, about twelve or eighteen hom's after the pimctme, with rigors, anxiety of counte- nance, and depression of the nervous system; with a quick pulse, and with inflammatory febrile reaction. On examining the finger, a pustule, or vesicle, with an inflamed areola, vdll be observed in the situation of the puncture; from this a few red lines may be seen extending up towards the arm-pit, where there may be swelling and tension. Diffuse inflammation of the areolar tissue of the limb sets in about the fifth or sixth day, extending up to the shoulder, and doivn the side of the chest to the flank. Abscesses foim, often with much pain, in these situations; they are usually somewhat diffuse, the pus being mixed inth shreds and sloughs. The general symptoms gradually assume an asthenic type; the tongue becomes brown, sordes accumulate about the lips and gums, low delu’ium sets in with a rapid feeble pulse, and death occurs in from ten days to three weeks. When incisions are made into the brawny tissue, it is found infiltrated with sero-pus, and in a sloughy state. If the patient live, large chcumscribed abscesses form under the pectoral muscles, in the axilla, and above the clavicle, accompanied by much exhaustion and depression of the system. The convalescenee is tedious and prolonged, and the constitution is often shattered for life. It is this form of the disease that resembles diffuse inflammation of the areolar tissue arising fr-om other causes ; and indeed there can be httle doubt that It is a cellular erysipelas dependent on toxic agency. That this form of dissection-wound is of a truly specific character, is evident fr-om the fact that patients labom-ing under it may communicate fatal erysipelas to their nurses and attendants ; as happened in the case of the late J. P. Potter, of Unh eisity CoUege Hospital, whose early death was much to be lamented. It IS also this kind of dissection-wound that is especially apt to occur after punctmes, received fr-om patients who have died of diffuse infianmiation of the sej-ous membranes. e s^ptoms jwoduced by contact, independently of any wound, with the JO les 0 peraons who have died of erysipelatous or ijyaemic diseases, some- imes vaiy, though still referable to the introduetion of a j)oison. Thus I ave ’noun a body to infect seriously in different ways six students who were ^ mi suppm-ation of the areolar tissue, under the pectorals linri + / of maniacal delirium ; a fom-th TUEATMENT.-On the receipt of a punctm-e in dissection, or in makiim- aFO ISO NED WOUNDS. 252 ^osif oxamiiuition, the best mode to prevent injurious consequences is to tie a string tightly round the finger above the injury, thus causing the blood to fiow, and perhaps to carry out the virus vith it. The part should then be ■well washed in a stream ot cold water at a tap, and sucked for some minutes; in this way any pioisonous matter that has been introduced may usually be got rid of. It is better not to apply caustics; they only imtate and inflame the finger, and can do but httle good. If any caustic be employed, it should be a drop of nitric acid let fall into the wound, or of pure carbolic acid, which is the only escharotic that has the power of destroying animal ^'irus. The nitrate of silver, Avhich is commonly employed, can never do much good, as it does not penetrate to a sufficient depth to be of service. Dissectors should bear in mind that the state of the constitution exercises great influence upon the effects of the pimctm’e; and that, in proportion as the health is soimd and the body not exhausted by over-fatigue, there is less likelihood of any injimious consequences ensuing. In the shghter forms of dissection-wound, attended by a moderate amount of inflammation, the part must be poulticed, leeches should be apphed, and the arm put in a shng. If the absorbents become inflamed, chamomile and poppy fomentations must be diligently used, abscesses must be opened early, and free incisions shoidd be made wherever there is much tension, even though matter have not already formed, with a view to prevent suppimation. The general treatment of clearing out the boAvels 'with a free calomel j)m’ge, followed by moderate stimulation, must be adopted in the early stage ; but tonics and strong- support will soon be required, and, if there be much constitutional h-ritation, opiates may advantageously be administered. The treatment of the more severe forms of dissection-injury consists principally in fomentations, and in early and very free incisions into the finger or other parts tha\; become tense and brawny. In the constitutional treatment, oiu- great reliance, after clearing out the intestinal canal by a free purge, con- sists in the administration of bark, ammonia, camphor, -wine, and brandy, ■«dth such fluid noiuishment as the patient can take ; the case being treated as one of the lowest forms of asthenic inflammation. If the patient survive, he must be sent as soon as possible into the coimtry, and must devote some months, perhaps, to the re-establishment of his health. The punctm-ed part often con- tinues irritable for a great length of time, even for many years, remaining red, inflamed, and desquamating, pustides sometimes appearing on it. This con- dition is best remedied by the occasional appheation of nitrate of silver. In conclusion, I cannot too strongly urge upon the dissecting student that unless he take scrupulous precautions as to cleanliness and disinfection, he may readily contaminate with septic poison any patient whose wound he dresses. Iso dissecting student or operating sm-geon who has examined a dead body ought to approach a patient without having pres-iously changed his Avoollen clothes, and, after washing, soaked his hands in carbolised water, or otherv ise disinfected himself.253 BURNS AND SCALDS. CHAPTER XII. —•— EFFECTS OF HEAT AND COLD. BTJENS AND SCALDS. A Burn is the result of the application of so great a degree of heat to the body as to produce either inflauimation of the part to which it is applied, or charring and complete disorganisation of its tissue. A Scald is occasioned by the application of some hot fluid to the body, giving rise to the same destruc- tive effects as are met with in burns, though differing from them in the appearances produced. Local Effects.—Burns and scalds vary greatly in the degi’ee of disorgani- sation of tissue to which they give rise; this variation depending partly upon the intensity of the heat, and partly upon the duration of its apphcation. The sudden and brief apphcation of flame to the siuface in’oduces but very slight disorganisation of the cuticle, with some hypertemia of the skin. If the part be exposed for a longer time to the action of the flame, as when a woman’s clothes take fire, the cutis itself may be disorganised; and if the heat be still more intense, as when molten metal falls upon the body, the soft parts may be deeply charred, or the whole thickness of a limb destroyed. So, also, the effects of scalds vary greatly, not oidy according to the temperature of the liquid, but accorchng to its character; the more oleaginous and thick the fluid, the more severe usually will the scald be. These various results of the apphcation of heat to the surface have been an-anged by Dupuytren into six different degrees of burn. This classification is not merely a fanciful, or even a pimely pathological, arrangement of the effects produced by the application of heat; but it is of great practical impor- tance, as the degree and character of the resulting cicatrix are dependent on the depth to which the bimn penetrates into the tissues. Hence the future conditions can be determined by ascertaining, in the first instance, the degree to which the burn belongs. In ths. first degree, the application of fire has been momentary. It has been followed by congestive redness and pain—phenomena that resemble erysipelas. But there is no solution of continuity, no destruction of tissue ; and conse- quently there is no resulting cicatrix. This is the acute stage of the first degree. In other cases, the effects may be more chronic, as in those instances where, in old people who sit constantly before the fire or over charcoal foot- warmers, changes are gradually induced in the integuments and superficial structures of the lower extremities. In the second degree the cuticle is detached ; and there are vesications and phlycten®. There is consequently loss of substance, so far as cuticle is concerned. This is sometimes followed by suppuration ; and, although no2 54 EFFEGTS OF HEAT AND COLD. cicatiix results in these cases, yet discoloration of the integ’ument is often left. In the thml degree the whole of the cuticle is destroyed, with a portion of the true skin ; but the cutis vera is not entirely destroyed. This is a most im- portant point, as it influences materially the character of the resulting cicatrix. As a thin layei of tine skin is left at the bottom of the eschar, complete repro- duction of the whole thickness of the integmnental structures is not necessary. In these cases there is a vivid red granulating surface, which suppimatcs abundantly. As the action of the burn extends to unequal depths, the granulatious will be very irregular, and, mdess great care be taken, the resulting cicatrix Ayill present coiresponding elevations and depressions. In the fourth degree there is comj)lete destruction of the skiii through its whole thickness, so that the subcutaneous areolar tissue is opened up. The process of cicatrisation in these cases may take place either by the growing- together of the opposite sides of the wound that results from the separation of the eschars, or by the formation of a thick and highly contractile cicatrix of entirely new formation. The process of repair in these cases is very slow, and is attended by long-continued suppuration. The resulting cicatrix is at first thin, red or purplish, glazed, often in the form of bands or bridles, and is liable to occasion great deformity by the cohesion of parts, as of the fingers, or by contraction, as at the elbow, or at the side of the neck and face, or by the closine of apertures, as of the nostrils. In the fifth and sixth degrees the destructive influence of the bimi penetrates to a greater or less depth into the muscles, bones, or joints. In the fifth degree, the more superficial muscidar structines are impheated : in the sixth degree the whole thickness of the limb may be destroyed and charred. This is very briefly the celebrated classification introduced by Dupuytren, and adopted by most writers on the subject as a practical exposition of the local efiect of burns. These various degrees are usually foimd associated to a greater or less extent; indeed, in the more severe cases, the first three or foin degrees are almost invariably met with together. SingicaUy, the fourth degree is the most important, and most severe biuns extend to it. Its importance is due to the complete destruction of the whole thickness of the skin, and the consequent extensive gi-anulating and suppm-ating siu’faces that are left; and to the tendency to deformity fr-om the contraction of the cicatrices, formed as they are of entirely new tissue, the great peculiarity and tendency of which is to contract into hard bands and bridles. The primary local effect, then, of a burn, if superficial, is to excite inflamma- tion of the skin ; if more extensive, to destroy more or less the soft sti-uctines, and even the bones. '\^Tien the cuticle is luibrokeu, the inflammation speedily subsides with some desquamation. When the soft parts are chaired, they are detached by a process of ificeration, analogous to what happens in the separa- tion of sloughs ; and an ulcerating and suppinating surface is left, remarkable for the large size, the florid colour, the great vascularity, and the rapid groudh of its granulations. The cicatrisation of such an ulcer, though generally pro- ceeding with great rapidity, has a constant tendency to be airested by the exuberance of the granulations. The cicatrix is usually thin, and of a bluish- red colom, and is especially characterised by a great disposition to contract.255 CONSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS OF BURNS. Incoming, after a time, puckered uj), and much indurated. This j)rocess of contraction and hardening, which begins immediately on the completion of cicatrisation, continues for many months, giving rise fi’equeutly to the most distressing deformities, and to the complete loss of motion and iTse in parts. These cicatrices ai-e fibro-plastic, and often extend deeply between and mat together the muscles, vessels, and soft structiu-es of a limb, of the face, or of the neck. The Constitutional Effects resulting from bum are most serious and' important; they depend not so much upon the depth of the injuiy as upon its situation, the extent of surface implicated, and the age of the patient. Thus a pei-son may have his foot completely charred and burned off by a stream of molten iron riuming over it, -with far less constitutional distiubance and dano-er than if the smfrice of the trunk and face be extensively scorched to the fii'st and second degrees ; bm-ns about the chest, the head, and the face, beino- far more likely to be attended by serious constitutional mischief than similar injiuies of the extremities. In children, the system generally suffers more severely from bimis than in adidts. The fever that sets in may be due to several causes, such as reaction after extreme piimary depression, local inflam- matory lesions, and the retention in the blood of waste jiroducts in consequence of the arrest of the cutaneous secretion in the burnt parts. The constitutional disturbance induced by burns, in whatever degree, may be divided into tiu’ee stages : 1, Depression and Congestion ; 2, Eeaction and Inflammation ; 3, Suppuration and Exhaustion. 1. The stage of Depression of the Nervous System and Congestion of Internal Organs, occupies the first forty-eight hoius; dining which, death may occur before inflammatory action can come on. Immediately on the receipt of a severe bimi the patient becomes cold and collapsed, and is seized Avith fits of shivering, which continue for a considerable time. He is evidentlv suffenng froni the shock of the injiny ; the severity of the shivering is usually indicative of the extent of the constitutional disturbance, and is more prolono-ed m those injimes that occupy a gi-eat extent of sinface, even though it be oW burnt to the first or second degree, than in those which, being of more limited superficial extent, affect the tissues deeply. On the subsidence of the symp- toms of depression there is usually a period of quiescence before reaction cSs on; and dining this period the patient, especiaUy if a child, not iinfr-equently dies comatose; death resulting from congestion of the brain and itlmej- branes, vuth, perhaps, serous efilision into the ventricles or the arachnoid esides these lesions, the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines as ivelj as the substance of the limgs, is usually found congested. The pathological phenomena of this period are altogether of a cono-estive character.

Death, ■which is more frequent during this stage than in the preceding one, is usually con- nected 'with some inflammatory condition of the gasti’o-intestiual mucous membrane or of the peritoneum. The lungs also are frequently affected, showing marked evidence of pneumonia or bronchitis ; but the cerebral lesions ' ai-e not so common as in the first stage ; though, when they occur, they present more unequivocal evidence of inflammatory action. The following are the results of the post mortem examinations which I have made. Of 17 cases in Avhich the contents of the cranium were examined during this period, there was congestion, -wnth evidence of inflammation and effusion of serous fluid, generally mixed -with blood, in 14 ; a healthy state in the remaining 3. Of 1!) cases in which the Imigs were examined, there was congestion of these organs jDrobably inflammatory in most instances ; rvith serum or lymph in the pleura, and redness of the bronchial mucous membrane, in 10. The limgs were hepatised in 5, and healthy in 4. The abdominal organs were examined in cases ; of these there was congestion of the mucous membrane, sometimes with evidence of peritonitis, in 11 ; ulceration of the duodenum in G ; a healthy state in 5. It is in this stage of burn, that the very remarkable and serious sequela, perforating ulcer of the duodenum, is especially apt to occiu. Ciu’hng, who fii-st attracted attention to it, explained its occuiTeuce by the supposition that Briirmer’s glands endeavour, by an increased action to compensate for the sup- pression of the exhalation of the skin consequent upon the biun ; and that the irritation thus induced tends to their inflammation and ulceration. This ulceration may, as Curling remarks, by rapidly proceeding to perforation, expose the pancreas, open the branches of the hepatic artery, or, by making a com- mrmication with the serous caA'ity of the abdomen, produce peritonitis, and thus cause death. It usually comes on about the tenth day after the occiuTence of the injmy ; seldom earlier than this. The only exception Avith which I am acquainted was in the case of a child nine years of age, who died on the fomth day after the bmm, in University College Hospital, and in whom an ulcer, of about the size of a shilling, AA'ith sharp cut margins, was fomid in the duode- num ; the intestinal mucous membrane generally being inflamed. That these ulcers are not invariably fatal, is eAudent from a case mentioned by Ciuling, in which, on death occiuring, from other causes, eight Aveeks after the injury, a recent cicatrix Avas found in the duodenum. These affections seldom occasion any very marked symptoms to indicate the natiue of the mischief, the patient suddenly sinking. In some instances there is ha3moiThage ; thouo-h this is not an imequivocal sign, as I have several times seen it happen from simple inflammatory congestion of the intestinal mucous mem- brane. Pain in the right hypochonchlac region, and perhaps vomiting, may also occin. 3. The stao'e of Suppuration and Exhaustion continues frnm the second week to the close of the case. In it we frequently haA'e symptoms of heefre, with much constitutional irritation from the long continuance of exhausting dis- charges. If death occur, it is most Irequently induced by inflammation of the257 MODE OF DEATH FROM BURNS. ]im£?s or i)leura ; affections of the abdominal organs and brain being rare during this stage of the injury.

Of o of the cases the cerebral contents Avere found healthy in 1 only ; there being inflammatory congestion in the other 4. PiiOGXOSis.—The influence of extent, degree, and situation, on the prognosis of bums has already been stated. The most fatal element indeed of these iiijm-ies is siq)erficial extent. It is generally believed by Surgeons that recovery cannot take place if one-third of the siuface of the body be scorched or burnt. Not only do the cutaneous nerves become gveatly imitated, and the nerAUUs system generally suffer severely, from the shock of an extensiA’C bium ; but, OAviiig to the arrest of the cutaneous secretion over a large siuface of the skin, congestion of the internal organs and of the mucous membranes ensues ; hence death may happen directly from this cause, or from the supervention of in- flammation in the already congested parts ; more particularly in the early periods of life, when the balance of the circulation is readily disturbed. The degree of burn influences the prognosis unfaA'oiuably rather so far as the part itself is concerned, than as the general system is affected. The most fatal in cases of biun is the fii-st week after the accident. I find that, in 50 cases of death fr’om these accidents, 33 proA'ed fatal before the eighth day ; 27 of these dying before the foiuth day. Of the remaining 17 cases, 8 died in the second week, 2 in the third, 2 in the foiuth, 4 in the fifth, and 1 in the sixth. Mode of Death, from Burn.—I^Tien in an ordinary conflagration a person is “ burnt to death,” the fatal ei’ent is occasioned not by the charring, roasting, or actual iucremation of the body, but by the induction of asphyxia. Life is mercifully extinguished by suffocation in the smoke, gases, and noxious A’aj)om*s lesultiiig from the fire, before the body itself is consumed. To what particular pioduce of combustion the asphyxia is due, is somewhat undecided. There is reason to beliei’e that in most cases it is carbonic oxide rather than carbonic acid that suffocates. I\Tieu a person is scA'erely and extensiinly burnt, and dies in the coiuse of a eu horns, or a day or two, death arises usually from shock, Avhich is most BCA ere and contiuuous. Dupuytren aaus of opinion that dining this stage the su eiei ^ ied from the excessii'e pain, and stated that “too great a loss of sensi- lality might kill as Avell as too great a loss of blood.” Whether this be so or not, it is peihaps difficult to say ; but the fact remains certain that, in indi- Ai lias AA 0 die dining this stage, the brain and its membranes wiU invariably le ouuc congested, usually AVith more or less effusion of serous fiuid into the Acn lie es and the arachnoid. This I have invariably found in every case that aie examined. In one half of the cases I hain found congestion of the oiacic and in the majority congestion of the abdominal organs, more ‘ pecia yo the mucous membrane of the stomach and ileum. Death dinino- partieSv of tf mtQvml inflammation, more qucntlv onho , ^^^^cous membrane and lungs, and less fr-e- ^ VOL f membranes. If the patient sun-ive into the period s258 EFFECTS OF HEAT AND GOLD. of suppuration, and then succumb, he will usually die from exlumstion, hastened or accompanied by inflammation of the lungs or pleura. Truatjient.—The treatment of burns must have reference to the constitu- tional condition, as well as to the local injuiy. A vast variety of local appli- cations have been recommended by different Surgeons, such as flom, starch, cotton-wadding, treacle, white paint, gum, solution of India-rubljer, &c. ; the principle of all these applications is, however, the same, ^^z., the protection of the biu-nt simfacc fr-om the air. T shall here eontent myself Avith describing the method that is usually followed with much success at the XJui\'ersity College Hospital. The Constitutional Treatment is of the utmost consequence. We haA'e seen how death arises at A'arious periods after these accidents fr'om different causes, and Ave must modify our treatment accordingly. The first thing to be done after the infliction of a seA’ere biuii is to bring about reaction ; the patient is trembling in a state of extreme depression, suffering great pain, is cold and shivering, and may sink fr’om the shock unless properly supported. A full dose, varied according to the age, of liquor opii, should be gHen at once in some Avaim brandy-and-water, and repeated, if necessary, in the course of an horn- or two. When the body is extensively but superficially bm-nt, the immersion of the patient in a Avarm bath gWes instantaneous rehef, assuaging the pain and removing the depression. "When reaction has fairly set in, the patient’s secretions shoidd be kept fr’ee by the administration of an occasional mild piu’gative and salines. Should any inflammatory symptoms about the head, chest, or abdomen manifest themselves, it Avill be necessary to haA'e recoiu’se to treatment appropriate to their natme. I have certainly seen patients saved in these circumstances by the employment of blood-letting and the appheation of leeches. But, in the vast majority of instances, the Adsceral comphcatioiis are of a Ioav and congestive type. In such cases oiu‘ great reliance must be on stimulants. Ammonia and bark, brandy and Avine, require to be freely giA’eu, Avith a sufficiency of nomishment ; and the irritability of the nervous system must l^e soothed by the frequent adminis- tration of full doses of opium. At a later period, when the strength has become impaired by the profuseness of the discharges, this tonic and stimu- lating plan must be actively continued. Local Treatment.—The bimit clothes haAoug been removed, the patient should be laid upon a blanket, and, whatever the degree of the birni, be well covered Arith the finest wheaten floim by means of an ordinary dredger. The flom- should be laid on thickly, but imiformly and gi-adually ; it forms a soft and soothing application to the sin-face. If the cuticle have been abraded or vesicated, the flom will form a thick crust, by aclmixtme Awth the serimi dis- charged fr-om the broken smface. If the skin be chai-red, the discharge which Avill be speedily set up around the eschar, AviU make the flour adhere to the part, foiming, as it Avere, a coating- impei-A-ious to the air The crus s thus formed should not be disturbed imtil they become loosencu by the dischaiges. when they should be removed ; and the ulcerated surface that is exposed shou i be di-essed Avith water-di'essiug, red AA'ash, or lead ointment, accoic 111^ 0 le amount of irritation existing; the suppm-ating sore beings indeed, managed ordinaiy principles. In some cases, lint dipped in the “ Carron oil, composeiCONTRACTION OF CICATRICES. 259 of equal parts of linscccl-oil and lime-water, to which, a small quantity of spirits of tuipentine might be added, has appeared to agree better than any- thing else : and in others cotton-wadding answer's admirably. Whatever local application be adopted, I hold it to be of the utmost importance in the early stages of the burn to change the dressings as seldom as possible ; not, indeed, until they have been loosened, or rendered offensive by the imbibition of the discharges. Every fresh dressing causes the patient very severe pain, jiroduccs depression, and certainly retards materially the progress of the case. Prevention and Kemoval of Contraction.—As cicatrisation advances, the exuberant groAvth of granulations should bo carefully repressed l)y the Fig. 98.—Contraction of Elbow from Cicatrix of Bum of Foiu-tli Degree. Fig. 99.—Contraction of Tliuml) from Bum of Fourth Degree. free use of nitrate of silver ; and the part must be fixed in a proper position by means of bandages, splints, and mechanical contrivances, specially adapted to counteract the tendency to contraction of the cicatrix, and the consequent deformity. This is especially neces- sary in biu’us about the neck, where the chin is liable to be drawn down on the sternum ; and in bums at the inside of limbs or the flexiu-es of ... ™re especiaUy the elbow, where coii- “Pt to ensue. (Kg. 08.) In bad bums of the hands, the fingers may be draAvn into and fixed upon the pahn of the hand, ma'y become webbed together, or may be dislocated and fixed inunovably against the dorsum. The accompanying woodcuts arc good illustrations of the bad effects of bums upon the hands. In Fig. 100 the little finger has been di.slocated backwards, and fixed iqDon the dorsum. In Figs. 101 and 102, the tAvo hands were frightfully deformed — the fingers being partly con- siuned, and partly Avebbed and matted together by dense cicatricial tissues. 1 his accident occuiTed in consequence of the night-shirt taking fire.

Fig. DO represents the thumb di'aAvu into such s 226o EFFECTS OF HEAT AND COLD. a position as to be no longer capable of being brought into apposition to the fingers. In the early treatment of such cases, I have ad^’antageonsly employed Fig. 101.—Defonnity of Biglit Hand from Burn of the Fourth or Fifth Degree. Fig. 102.—Deformity of Left Hand from Burn of the Fifth Degree. the clastic traction of India-rubber bands to counteract the tendency to con- traction of the scar. Similar contractions may occim in the foot, lea’iing gi’eat deformity, as in Fig. 103, where the heel is shown to be retracted, and the whole of the toes spread out in a fan shape. In this case amputation (Pirogoff’s) was the only means left for securing an nsefid limb. Corrosive licpiids, such as strong snlphiu’ic acid, when applied to the sm’face, pro- duce very similar effects to those that result from the more severe degrees ofbiu’u; leading cicatrices contract- ed, irregular, and often, as in Fig. 104, rugged and warty. The contracted cicatrices resulting from burns may, if of recent date, be stretched out by the pressiu’e of strips of plaster, the traction of India-rubber bands, or the action „ . , , • of rack-and-pimoii apprtns. The good effect of tUs plan of treatment is especially marked in contractions at the elbow, or in those that fix the arm to the side. These means are particularly useful ni childi-en, and indeed are so in all cases, provided the cicatrix be not too old—not more than a year ; after that time, it wiU seldom yield without dhision. Operations for the Removal of the Effects of Contraction consequent upon bimis are occasionaUy required ; and, if judiciously planned and executed, may do much to remedy the patient’s condition. The operations that aie practised with this ^uew are of two kinds : 1. Simple cbusion of the lau ty and Contracted Cicatrix ; 2. The Trausplantation ot a flap of adjacent health} Skin into the gap left after the di\'ision of the cicatrix. Fig. 103.—Deformed Foot from Buru of tlie Foiu-tli and Fifth Degrees. Fig. 104.—Wai-ty Cicatrix of Arm resii frig from action of Sulphuric Acid.26i OTERsiTIONS OX CONTRACTED CICATRICES. 1. In the first operation, that of simply Dividing the Cicatrix, three points require special attention : 1st, that the division extend completely thron<?h the cicatrix from side to side into the adjacent healthy skin ; 2nd, that the incision be earned throu<?h the whole depth and thickness of the cica- trix into the healthy cellnlo-adipose layer which will be found beneath it, and may always be recognised by its yellow colom-; 3rd, that all contractile bands lying in this layer be fairly divided. The great obstacle to the success of this operation, however, consists in the fiict that the new granulations, which spring up after the division of the contracted cicatrix, are in their turn liable to take on contractile action. After the di^'ision of the cicatrix, also, it may be foiuid that the subjacent structures have been so rigidly fixed in their abnormal posi- tion as not to admit of extension. It may then be necessary to employ screw- apparatus, or even to divide fascia) and tendons, before the part can be restored to its normal shape. Care must, however, be taken in doing this, that subja- cent structures of importance, such as large blood-vessels, or nerves, be not so closely connected with the cicatrix as to render Avound or division of them raiavoidable. In the neck, cicatricial bands AviU often come into very dangerous ]iroximity to the external jugular vein, which becomes gveatly distended by the pressiu’e thus exercised upon it. And at the elbow, which is a common seat of contraction from bums, the brachial artery may become involved in the cicati'ix to a dangerous extent. I have heard of one case in which this vessel Avas divided in cutting through the cicatrix, Avhen amputation of the ann was immediately resorted to. These operations are most successful in cases of contraction at the flexures of the joints, as of the elboAV. There, all that need be done is to divide the cicatrix down to the subjacent healthy structures, and then, by the aj)phcation of splints or scrcAV-apparatus, gTadually to extend the limb, and allow granu- lation to go on in the extended position. Much caution, however, Avill here be necessary ; for, if the contraction be of A’ery long standiug, the arteries and uerAcs Avill have become shortened, and incapable of stretching luider any force that may be safely employed ; hence they may easily be torn. 2. Oj)Ciations that are undertaken for the removal of the disAgiuements that occur about the flice and neck as the result of burns, require much manage- ment. In these cases, simjAle diA'ision of the cicatrix is insufficient; and Transplantation of a Flap of Skin is required in adchtion. After the cicatiix and all cicatrieial bauds haAn been freely dinded in accordance Avith t e lules just giAeu, a flap^ of integimient, of sufficient size to All the greater part of the gap, must be dissected up from the neighboiuing parts of the neck, chest, or shoidder, and laid into the cicatrix. There it should be flxed by two 01 ree points of suture ; but extreme care must be taken that no traction be pu upon it, lest it slough. Union takes place by the second intention in the majoiity o instances ; but a A'ery satisflictory result is left, as is shown by the annexcc gures (107, 108), taken before-aiid after operation, and as has been i!!) nf T T TI>0 directions given by Toalo for the ly ciiatrisal r fT' - rose rofl ivf r''" ’T'"’ r ‘0 ts, that I gne them nearly m Ins own words.

From the lower end of each incision the knife is can’ied upwards to a point one inch beyond the angle of the month (A). The two flaps thus marked out are freely and Fig. 107.—Incisions in Teale’s Fig. 108 —Teale s Operation : tlie Operation for Cicatrici.al Flax's m Place. Defonnity of the Lower Lil'. deeply dissected np. The alveolar border of the middle portion is then fresh- ened. The lateral flaps (Fig. 108, C A) are now raised, united by twisted sutines in the mesial line, and supported as on a base by the middle flap, to which they are also attached by a few points of siitime, leading a triangular even sin- face (C C) to granulate. In addition to the division of the cicatrix, James, of Exeter, in these cases very successfully employed a screw-collar, by which the chin can be loosened from the sternum, and gi-adual extension of the cicatrux effected. In severe bunis of the side of the face and neck the resiilting cicatrix is sometimes so dense, resisting, and contracted, that immobility of the jan results and the month cannot be opened, or at most the teeth can only be separated to a slight extent, so as to admit liquid nourishment. ii to restore the mobility of the jaw and the power of sepaiating _ ^ ce in these cases, Bizzoli and Esmarch have proposed making a fiilse joint in the lower jaw on the side bimit, immediately in front of the cicatrix. Rizzoh263 FROST-BITE. (Iocs this by simple division of the bone by means of a narroAV saw: Esmarch recommends, as a more elfectual procedure, the removal of a wedge-shaped piece of bone about three-quarters of an inch in width above and one mch m width below. Mtcr this has been done, the patient Avill be able to move the jaw at the normal articulation on the healthy side and at the false joint where the jaw has been cut across. Warty Cicatrices.—The cicatrices of burns, especially on the neck and chest, occasionally become after a time projecting, red, and glazed, as if composed of a mass of fungating granulations, smoothed down aud lightly skinned over. This condition, which may be looked on as a substanti^e disease, and resembles keloid in appearance, has chiefly been met with in children; but I haA’C scA'cral times seen it in adults, especially in women who had been badly burnt by their dresses taking fire. In these cases I observed what I haA'e noted in other similar instances in children ; that the waity cicatrices were the seat of the most intolerable itching, which no external application seemed to relieve. I have, hoAvever, seen the pruritus mitigated by the administration of large doses of liquor potasste. If small and naiTOAV, these cicatrices may be dissected out: if large, they cannot be removed without risk of much hmmoiThage ; for, although fibroid, they are A^ery vascular. The cause of this peculiar outgrowdh of dense cicatricial tissue is altogether imknoAvu. It may in some cases, perhaps, be owing to want of care in checking the luxiu’iance of the granulations ; but in other cases it ocems though every attention is paid to the heahng of the wound. The cicatrix of a bimi may become the seat of a mahgnant gi'OAvth many years afterwards. I have removed a large epithelioma from the cicatrix of a bm-n, on the fore-arm of a Avoman, seventy years after the injury had been inflicted, which happened AAhen she wns three or four years of age. Primary Amputation may be required if the bmu have destroyed the whole thickness of a limb ; the part charred should then be removed at once, at the most conA'enient point aboA’e the seat of injury. This operation may also be required at a later period, if, on the sejAaration of the eschars, it be found that a large joint has been opened, and is suppmating ; or if the disorganisation of the limb be so great as to exhaust the powers of the patient in the ettbrts at repair. Great caution, how'CA’er, should be employed in determining on the proiAi’iety of amputating Avhen the bmn has extended, though in a minor degi’ee, to other parts of the body, lest the powers of the patient be insuffleient for the double call that AviU thus be made upon them. FROST-BITE. % A\ hen the body has been exposed to seA’ere or long-continued cold, Ave find, as in the case of bums, that local and constitutional effects are produced. Local Ixfluexce of Cold.—This is chiefly manifested on the extremities of the body, as the nose, ears, chin, hands, and feet, AAhere the circulation is less active than at the more central jAarts. It chiefly ocems to an injurious degi'ce in very young or aged persons, or in those Avhose constitutions have been depressed by Avant of the necessaries of life. In such persons frost-bite and the lesulting gangi-ene are less due to the Ioav temperatme to Avhich they are exposed, than to the habitual Ioav Aitality of the extremities.EFFECTS OF HEAT AND COLD. 264 In the first tlcgTco of frost-bite that calls for the attention of the Surgeon . there is a feeling of stiffness, with complete numbness of the part that has been exposed to cold ; it is pale, m’th a bluish tint, and somewhat shrunken. In this state the ■\’itality of the part is not destroyed, but merely suspended. On the retiu'ii of circulation, in the affected part, a burning tingling pain is ! felt, the part becomes red, and shows signs of a tendency to inflammatory ■ action. Indeed, this appearance of urflammation, often accompanied by a j burning sensation, is probably the immediate consequence of extreme degrees of ! cold, as it is experienced on touching solidified carbonic acid or frozen mercury. 1 In the next degree, the vitality of the part is completely destroyed; all j sensibility and motion in it are lost, it becomes shrunken and livid; but i though its vitality may have been aimihilated by the inmiediate application of ; the cold, it is not imtil the part has become thawed that gangrene usually mani- I fests itself ; it then appears to do so by the violence of the reaction induced, the ■ part rapidly assmning a black colom, becoming dry, and separating eventually, 1 as aU other mortified parts do, by the formation of a line of ulceration I aroimd it. I The Constitutional Effects of a Ioav temperature need not detani us. It is I well known that, after exposure to severe or long-continued cold, a feeling of heaviness and stupor comes on, and gTadually creeps on to an overpowering tendency to sleep, which, if yielded to, terminates in coma, and a speedy, though , probably painless, death. Teeatment oe Fkost-Bite.—This consists in endeavouring to restore the 'Vitality of the frozen parts. In doing this the gveat danger is, that reaction i may rim on to so gveat a degree as to induce sloughing of the structures, the I vitality of which has aheady been seriously impaired. In order to prevent ' this accident, the temperatm-e must be elevated very gradually and mth ; extreme care. The patient should be placed in a cold room, without a fire, , any approach to which would certainly lead to the destruction of the irost- ' bitten members. These must then be gently nibbed with snow, or vfith cloths ■ dipped in cold water, and held between the hands of the person manipulating ; i as reaction comes on, they may be enveloped in flamiel or woollens, and a small !■: quantity of some warm liquid or spirit and water may be administered. In r this way sensibihty and motion will be gradually restored, often with much I bimiing and stinging pain, redness, and ^'esication of the part. If gangi’ene ! have come on, or if the reaction riui into sloughing, the sphacelated part, if of • small size, should be allowed to detach itself by the natiual process of separa- ' tion, which should be as httle interfered ivith as possible, the vitality of the I parts continuing at a low ebb, and extension of gangvene being readily induced, j If the gangrenous parts be of greater magnitude, amputation may be requiied. ; This should be done at the most convenient situation, as soon as the line of i separation has fully formed. ; If the person who has been exposed to cold be apparently dead, he must be put in a cold room, the tempcratiu’e of which must be very slonly laised. Friction, as just described, should be practised, and artificial respiration set 1 up. These means must be continued for a long time, even if no signs of litb appear : there being on record instances of recovery after scveial houis ot ! suspended animation. IINJURIES OF VEINS 265 CHAPTER XIII. —t— INJURIES OF BLOOD-VESSELS. INJURIES OP VEINS. Veixs are very commonly wounded suicidfdly, accidentally, or in surgical operations ; but, unless they be deeply seated, their injuries are seldom attended by any serious consequences. Occasionally subcutaneous rupture or laceration of a vein takes place from a blow or strain. In such cases extensive extravasation of blood AviU occiu’, Avhich, however, usually undergoes absolution in a few iveeks ; but it may suppurate, or take on itself the changes described at page 18G. This accident is most commonly seen in the saphena vein. There are three sources of danger in open wounds of veins : 1, Loss of Blood ; 2, Diffuse Inflammation of the Vessel; 3, Entrance of Air into the Circulation. 1. A A’ein is known to be wounded, ivhen dark blood floAvs in a rapid and uniform stream fr’om the seat of injury. If the A’essel AA'Ounded be one of con- siderable magnitude, or in close proximity to the centre of the circulation, the flow of blood may be rapidly fatal, more especially if its escape be faA'Oured by the dependent position of the part. The Hsemorrhage fr-om a wounded vein may, if the vessel be superficial, be aiTested by position, and the pressure of a compress, with a few turns of a roller. If the vein be one of considerable size, as the internal jugular, or if it be so situated that pressiu’e cannot be brought to bear on it, it may require the application of a ligature ; but this should, if possible, ahvays be avoided, inasmuch as it is apt to occasion dangerous inflammation of the A^essel. I he womid in a A’ein is healed by a slight inflammation taking place aboiit^ the lips of the incision, and giAnng rise to the formation of a distinct cicatrix AAithout occlusion of the vein. 2. In some cases, fr-om the irritation of the simple wound, and in others fr-om the application of the ligature, a Diffuse Inflammation of the Vein takes place, which usually proA'CS frxtal.

Tims, a patient was admitted into University College Hospital under Mr. Quain, Avith a eontused Avoimd in the axilla, received in falling upon some ii’on railings ; no change took place in the circulation of the arm for tAvo days, AAdien pulsation in the radial artery ceased, the injured a'CsscI having CA idcntly become plugged by plastic deposit. Rupture and Laceration.—An artery may lic torn either partially or completely across. When Partial Rupture occurs, the iutenial and middle coats only give way, the toughness of the external coat preventing its laceration. This accident is especially apt to occur in consecpience of bloAvs or strains upon diseased or Aveakened vessels, and thus may possibly lay the foundation for dissecting and other aneurisms. In other cases, the niptmed portion of the coats becomes tinned down into the inside of the vessel, and, acting as a A'alve, prevents the finther progress of the blood through it, thus gi\-ing rise to gangrene of the limb. In .some cases the partially ruptincd vessel becomes blocked up by plastic matter, occluding its interior, but without producing gangrene. The Complete Rupture of an ai’tery may occur either in an open wound or under the integuments. When an artery is torn across in an open wound, as in the aAvdsion of a limb by machinery, or by a cannon-shot, there is usually but little hmmorrhage, even from arteries of the magnitude of the axillary or the femoral, and though the A^essel hang out of the Avound, pulsating to its very end. The absence of bleeding is oAAung to the internal and middle coats, AiUich are fragile, breaking off short and contracting someAAdiat ; while the external coat and the sheath of the vessel, being elastic, are dragged doAim and twisted OA'er the torn end of the artery, so as comjiletely to prevent the escape of blood. When the laceration of the artery is subcutaneous, as occasionally happens in the attempted reduction of an old dislocation of the shoulder, either extensive extravasation, or one or other of the A'arieties of Traumatic AnouTtsm, to be described in Chapter XV., page 313, may be produced. "Wounds of Arteries, Avhether pimctined or cut, may be dmded into those that do not penetrate into the interior of the vessel, and those by Avhich it is completely laid open. Non-penetrating Wounds of arteries are very rare. Guthrie, however, relates the case of a gentleman Avho cut his throat, and in Avhom the carotid artery was exposed and notched through the external and middle coats only ; the vessel finally gave way on the eighth day, death ensuing. A case has also occiured at the London Hospital, in Avhich a suicidal Avoimd of the throat had exposed the carotid artery. After death, it was foiuid that the nmer and middle coats of the vessel had been dmded by the pressure of the knife, AALich ■ was blunt, but that the external coat had been left entire, and under this a dissecting anem’ism was found. In Penetrating Wounds of an artery, there is always haimorrhage ot an arterial character, imless the puncture be so fine as to be closed by the mere elasticity of the coats of the vessel. Thus, l\Iaisomieuve has shown that an artery may be punctured with a fine needle, without any haimorrhagc or othci unfavourable event resulting. If, hoAvever, the puncture be aigci lan is,ILEMOFdlHAGE FROM ^yOUNDED VESSELS. 267 bciii«- made by a tenaculum or hook, it does not commonly close in this way ; and ”if hasmon'hage do not take place immediately, it will probably come on in the course of a few hours or days, from ulceration of the vessel. If the wound be still larger, there is always an amount of immediate haemorrhage proportionate to its size and to that of the vessel. The Direction of the wound in the artery influences materially its cha- racters. If the cut be parallel to the axis of the vessel, there is less tendency to ga])ing of the edges than if it be oblique. In trans\'erse wounds of arteries, the retraction of the coats is so great as to cause the woiuid to assume some- what of a circular appearance. If the artery be cut completely across, there is always a less degree of hmmoirhage than when it is partially divided ; for the retraction and contraction of the cut ends may then be sufficient to close the vessel, which is not the case Avhen it is merely wounded. AVhen the Avoiuid in the artery is subcutaneous, commmiicating only by an oblique and nairow apertiue with the siuface, little, if any, external htemoirhage takes place, but extravasation of blood occius. The extravasation may either be pomed into one of the serous cavities, or it may be diffused in the areolar tissue of the limb or part, infiltrating it deeply and extensively, and perhaps by its pressiue ultimately producing gangrene ; or it may be elfused in a more circiunscribcd manner, gi^rng rise to one or other of the forms of traumatic anem-ism (see Chapter XV.). HiEMOREHAGE PROM WOUNDED VESSELS. Local Sigxs.—The characters of the bleeding or hsemorrhage differ accord- ing to the natm-e of the vessel from which the blood escapes. When a Vein is wounded, the blood that is poured out is of a dark colour, and flows in an uniform stream ; the force Anth which this is projected depending on the conditions in AA'hich the wounded vein is placed. If there be any pressure between the Avound and the heard, as of a ligatm’e upon the A’essel; if the position of the part be such as to favoiu the gTaAntation of the blood towards the wound ; or if the muscles of the limb be made to contract, the force of the floAA^ of blood will be increased. VTien an Artery is AA'ounded, the blood that escapes is of a bright vermiliorr or scarlet coloru. It flows by jets, syrrehrorrorrs Avith the contractions of the left A entricle ; betAveerr the jets the floAv does not cease, but the streanr hecomes continrrous. Irr the great majority of cases the jet comes ouly frum the proxiirral ajrerture, dark blood issuing from the distal operring irr a corr- tinorrs aird trickling streanr ; but irr some situatiorrs a jet of blood of arterial character may issue from the distal as Avell as from the proximal errd of the cut A essel, as irr Avounds of the palmar and plarrtar arches, or of the arteries of blood flo\vs, the jet Icssoirs irr height, iir coirseqrrerrce 0 the AA^akcning of the heart’s action. The height arrd force of the jet irr all cases depend greatly on the size of the vessel; thus the jet from the femoral artery is stronger than that from a muscrrlar brarrch of the thigh, Wherr a small arterial branch is Avounded near its origirr frorrr the mairr trunk, the jet ■»! a ways be forcible and free ; so also the proximity to the ceirtre of the arculatronAvill iiiflireircc materially the force Avith Avhich the blood is nronelled rrom the Avoirnd iir the A'essel. ^INJURIES OF BLOOD-VESSELS. 268 Extravasation. When tlic blood is not poured out on the surfaee, but escapes from a wounded 's'essel into the areolar tissue of a part, the substance ol or[>‘ans, or internal cavities, it is termed an Extravusation. In these cases there arc not the ordinary local signs of an external htcmoiThage ; but other local phenomena, such as swelling, dulncss on percussion, displacement of organs or parts, discolouration of the skin and subjacent areolar tissue, indicate that blood is being poimed out subcutaneously ; and wo judge of the quantity of the blood that has escaped, not only by the extent of these local phenomena, but by the general effect produced upon the system by its loss. CoNSTiTUTioxAL EFFECTS OF HiEMORRHAGE.—These depend upon the quantity of blood lost, on the rapidity with which it is poured out, on the state of the patient’s constitution, and on the vessel which fiumishes the blood. When a large quantity of blood is suddenly lost, as when a main artery is cut across or an aneurism bursts, the patient may die forthwith ; he falls down in a state of syncope, with a pale cold surface, and Uvidity about the lips and eyes, and gasps a few times, sighs, is very restless, and suffers convulsive movements of the limbs before he expires. If the quantity lost be not so great as to produce death, but be yet very considerable, the patient becomes faint and sick, vdth coldness and pallor of the siu’face, gveat restlessness and agitation, thirst, noises in the ears, and failure or complete loss of sight. If the quantity lost, though considerable, be not so great as this, or be spread over a greater interval of time, so that the patient is enabled to rally between the recmrences of the htemoiThage, a state of anaemia wiU be induced, characterised by pallor of the skin and of the mucous membranes, palpitation of the heart, rushing noises in the head, amaiu’osis, a tendency to syncope when in the erect position, oedema of the extremities, and general debility of the system. After excessive loss of blood the patient may gradually rally, and, as the vital fluid is reproduced in his system, he may recover without any bad effects ; or he may fall into a state of anmmia, which may perhaps never be completely recovered from, and may be associated Awth various forms of local debility and disturbance of functions. After very abimdaiit loss of blood, “ htemoirhagic fever ” is apt to set in, characterised by a tendency to reaction in the system, with extreme irritability of the heart and arteries. It is irritative fever con- joined with anfemia. There is but a small quantity of blood in the system, and the heart and arteries make violent efforts to drive it foiwaixls. This condition is marked by the symptoms of extreme loss of blood, alteniatiug with periods of irrtermitterrt reactiorr ; the prrlse becomes much hruried, fluttering, jerking, and irregirlar in force and frequerrey; there are slight flrrsh- ings of the face and brilhancy of the eyes, rapidly passing again into pallor and syrreope ; and if the hmmorrhage eventually prove fatal, delirirmr and corrvrrl- sions, with excessive restlessness, usually precede death. The rallying power is greater irr the yoruig tharr irr the old, arrd greater irr womerr tharr in men. Irr advarreed life blood is slowly reproduced ; arrd a great loss of so complex a flrrid, whether by accident or in an operation, is seldom completely recovered from, and often leads to the development of dangcrorrs or even fatal secondary diseases of a lorv typo. As has already beerr stated at p.^ 11, it is in this rray that excessive loss of blood at air operation, as lor stoiro in an aged nran, oftenOTFAIATION OF TBANSFUSION. 269 proves iudircctly and remotely fatal. The body of a person who has died from the etfects of lumnorrhage presents a pccnliarly blancdied, semi-transparent, waxen look ; the lips, aho of the nose, and finger-nails, have a somewhat li’sdd apix^arance, contrasting strongly with the clear, yellowish-white hue of the general snrtace. Arterial is more dangerous than venous ha3morrhage. The same quantity of blood poiwed out from a Avounded artery Avill produce a greater effect on the system than an equal loss of blood from a divided vein. Children bear the loss of blood badly—a A-ery small haemorrhage may induce fatal syneope iu infants. * Tre^atjeext.—The General Treatment of haemorrhage is sufficiently simple. After the floAV of blood has been ai-rested by proper local means, such as AAnll hereafter be described, the effects of its loss ai-e usually speedily recovered from by rest and good nourishment. In some cases, however, the nutritiA’e process becomes permanently impaired, and a state of chronic antemia is induced ; AA’hich, iiotAAithstanding the administration of chalybeate preparations, may continue tlnough life, and terminate in cachexia, phthisis, or diarrhoea. ■\Vhcn the loss of blood is considerable, and is attended by symptoms of much prostration, it may be necessary to have recourse to immediate measm’es iu order to prevent the syncope from being fatal. With this Anew the patient should be laid recumbent, AAoth the head Ioav ; and pressin-e may be exercised upon the abdominal aorta or the main arteries of the limbs, or Esmarch’s elastic bandage and toimiiquet may be applied, so as to confine the blood as much as possible to the nervous and circulatory centres. If death appear imminent from the effects of the htemorrhage, as happens in some cases of flooding, recourse may be had to transfusion of blood ; the influence of Avhich, in restoring the failing powers of the heart and nervous system, is immediate and most striking, and has been unquestionably determined by the obserA'ations of Blundell and other obstetricians. Operation of Transfusion.—Although there is reason to belieA'e that Transfusion of Blood was not unknoAvn to the ancients, and the method by Avhich it could be practised was distinctly described by Libavius in 1G15, little A\-as done on the subject until Sir Christopher Wren, in 1657, proposed and practised the operation of injecting medicated liquids into the veins of animals. The operation aaus first jDerfornied on man in France, by Denis and Emmerets, on June 15, 1607. In NoA'ember of the same year, it was done in this eountry by Drs. LoAA’’er and King. In the early experiments, the blood of sheep and calves aa'us used. The most extraA’agaEit ideas AA'cre formed as to the utility of transfusion. It was supposed to be capable of cming diseases by substituting the blood of a healthy animal for that of a diseased person, of remoAung insanity by the injection of the blood of animals of a gentle and docile character into the A'eins of a maniac, and of prolonging life indefinitely. These pretensions led to a scientific controversy of the most A’iolent kind ; and, some deaths haAu'ng oecurred from the practice, partly in consequence of the rude and imperfect instruments used, transfusion Avas prohibited in France, and fell into disrepute in England. Although the subject was occasionally rcAiA’ed, little attention Avas paid to it until about fifty years ao-o Avhen transfusion was again practised by Dr. Blundell, Avho AA’isely restrictedits employment to those cases chiefly occuring in obstetric practice, in AA^hich, in270 INJURIES OF BLOOD-VESSELS. conseqiionco of sudden and profuse ]ia3moiTliage, the patient is threatened with a fatal syncope. Dr. Blundell invented a syi’inge by which the operation might ])e more safely performed than had heretof(;re been done ; and by his practice, experiments, and argnments, established the system on a secure basis. Since his time, many impro-\-ements ha^'e been made in the method of per- forming’ transfusion. Dp to a recent period, this was in^'ariably done by l■ecei^’ing the blood from the donor into a vessel of some kind, and thence pumping it into the veins of the recipient. But this method is attended by n A Fig. 109.—Avelmg s Metliod of Transfusion. A, Arm of Donor; B, Arm of Reciinent. two soin’ces of danger, which no mechanical provisions are sufficiently accui’ate entirely to prevent, viz., the introduction of air, and the coagulation of the fibrine of the blood. Dr. Aveling has, however, OA'ercome these difficulties by the employment of an ajiparatus, which is seen in operation in Fig. 100. Aveling’s transfusion apparatus consists of two silver bevel-ended tubes, one of which is introduced into the vein of the donor, the other into that of the re- cipient. The vein should be opened as recommended by Avehng, by exposing the vessel, and then making a sharp cut into it (Fig. 110.) The India-rubber part of the apparatus is filled with warm water, which is retained there by turning the two stop-cocks. It is then fitted on to the tubes in the veins, and the stop-cocks opened. The India- rubber tube on the efferent side is then compressed, and the bulb slowly squeezed, so as to empty the water which it contains into the recipient vein. The tube on the recipient side is then compressed, and that on the efferent opened ; the bulb slowly fills Tvith blood, which is then injected by compressing the e&rent and openmg the recipient tube, and so alternately until a sufficient quantity is throwii m. The operation of transfusion is one of much delicacy, requiring special caie lest one of two accidents happen, viz., the injection of air into the patieiit s veins or of a fibrinous embolon. The first danger is obviated by filhii^ the Fig, . no.—Introduction of Transfusion-pipe into Vein. )OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 2‘Jl traiisfnsiiig apparatus ^vith warm A\'atcr ; the second, by not alloAving’ tlie blood to coagulate in it. The blood may be defibriiiated Avithout losing its properties as a restoratiA'c ; and in the event of proper transfusing apparatus not being aA'ailable, and the Surgeon haA'ing to use an ordinary hydrocele or aspirator syi-inge, it Avonld only lie Avise to take this in’ecaution. Panum, of Copenhagen, has clearly shoAAm by numerous experiments that the fibrine is not in any Avay necessary to the sirccess of the operation. He recommends that the blood be draAvn into a cup kept Avarm in a basin of hot Avater. It is then to be Avell AA’hipped, filtered through a fine cloth, and injected. The essential part of the blood is the red corpuscles, AAiiich are Avanted to serA-e as can-iers of oxygen. The remoA'al of the fibrine in this AA'ay materially facilitates the operation, Avhich is otherwise attended by some difficulty OAAdng to the liability to coagulation of the blood in the transfusing apparatus, or by danger from embolism from the injection of coagulum into the veins. If transfusion be determined on, it should not be delayed until the last moment, Avhen the agony of death has already commenced ; as then the actions of the nervous and circulatory systems may be so impaired that the patient is no longer recoverable, or, if temporarily so, Avill speedily lapse into a state of ffital disease. The Local Treatment of hoemon-hage AA'ill be fully described in the next chapter.ARREST OF ARTERIAL ILEMORRIIAGE. 272 CHAPTEK XIV. —♦— ARREST OF ARTERIAL HAJMORRHAGE. The arrest of arterial hEemorrliage is perhaps the most important topic that can engage the Snrgeon’s attention, as on the safe accomplishment of this the success of every operation is necessarily dependent. In studying this subject we must first investigate the Means that are adopted by Natimc for the Sup- pression of Htemorrhage ; and, secondly, the imitation of these by Siu-gical Art. NATtTEAL ARKEST OE HJEMORRHAaE. The history of the investigations into the means adopted by natm’e for the arrest of hfemorrhage is full of interest to the Simgeon, and is excellently given in Dr. J. F. D. Jones’s v^ork on Htemon’hage. No subject in sin-geiy affords a stronger evidence of the advantage of the application of “Experimental Pathology ” to practice, than this, as onr knowledge of it has been wholly o-ained by experiments on the lower animals; and by the sacrifice of the lives of a few dogs, donkeys, and calves, those of hundreds—^probably of thousands of human beings are annually preserved. Petit, who published several memoirs on this subject in 1731 and followmg years, states that ha3morrhage is arrested by the formation of two clots—one outside the vessel, which he calls the “ Convercle,” or Cover ; the other inside, the “ Bonchon,” or Ping—the first being formed by the last di'ops of blood that issue, the second by the few drops that are retained. These clots by their adhesion to the internal coat of the vessel and to the orifice, he says, stop the iDleediug. When a ligatin-e is applied, a similar clot forms above it. He recommends compression, and the support of the clot. Morand, in 1730, added much of interest. He admitted the formation of coao-ula, blit insisted on the importance of the changes in the artery itself; which, he showed, became corrugated, contracted, and retracted. ^ Morand entertained erroneous views as to the stmctine and functions of arteries, but he established the great fact that changes occin in the arteiy itself. Sharp, in the second edition of his work on Operative Singeiy, pubhshed 111 1730, sup- ported the same doctrine. tt 1 Kirkland in 1703, wrote an excellent treatise on the subject. He showeci that htemorrhage was lessened by swooning, and that an ai-tery contracted up to its nearest collateral branch ; and he was of opinion that the coagiilum did not arrest the bleeding. His views were adopted and supported by lute, Gooch, Aikin, and other surgeons of his day. nf J. Boll took a retrograde step by denying the retraction and contiactio 1 ot the artery, and the importance of the internal coagnlnm, and by attributing the aiTest of haemorrhage solely to the injecting of the sinTonnding aieolai tissue Avith blood.273 NATURAL ARREST OF HAEMORRHAGE. It was not until 1805, that Dr. Jones, by a series of admirably conducted investigations, finally detennined the mode in which the arrest of hffimorrhage takes place. Since his time but little has been added to our knowledge of the subject, so complete and exhaustive was his examination of it. The Natural Arrest of Arterial Hemorrhage is effected by means that in the first instance ai’e Irngorarg, but afterwards Temporary Means.—The means which arrest temporarily the flow of blood from an artery are tlu’eefold. If the vessel be small, as the facial or radial, these means are sufiicient in many cases to stay the haemorrhage without the interference of the Surgeon ; and, whatever be the size of the vessel, his opera- tions are materially assisted by the efforts which nature makes, though they may be sometimes unsuccessful, to prevent a fatal escape of blood. They consist in: 1. The Coagulation of and an Alteration in the Constitution of the Blood ; 2. A Diminution of the Force of the Heart’s Action, and consequently of the pressiu-e on the inner coat of the vessel; 3. Certain Changes effected in and around the Artery. 1. The Coagulation of the Blood in and around the wounded artery is the first and most important means adopted by nature for the arrest of hjemoiThage. Were it not for the projDerty of coagulation possessed by the blood, that fluid would continue to drain away from any cut artery, however small, imtil hfe became extinct. But the coagulation of the blood is sufficient of itself, in most cases, and in all cases of vessels below a certain size, to close the opening in the artery, and so to arrest the fm-ther escape. The Alteration that takes place in the Blood consists in an increase of its coagulability as it flows. The blood that escapes fr’om a wounded artery has fi’om the first a tendency to glaze and coagidate about the cut vessel, so as to offer a mechanical obstacle to the fru-ther escape of the fluid. This of itself is sufficient in the smaller vessels to arrest the hccmorrhage ; the more so, as has been pointed out by Hewsou, in consequence of the last florving blood beiii”‘ more coagulable than the first. ° 2. The Diminution in the Force of the Heart’s Action, orving to the patient becoming faint or collapsed, exercises a very material influence in arresting the flow of blood fr-om an artery. The forcible mamier in which the jet of blood is propeUed at each systole of the ventricle, is the principal obstacle to the coagulation of the blood around and within the cut vessel; for not only does the moveinent of the blood prevent coagulation, but, so long as the jet IS more powerful than the cohesion of the clot, it wiU certainly wash thevcoagulum away. As the blood flows, and the heart’s impulse gradually lessens m force, the jet falls lower and lower; rrntil at last, when faintness comes on, rt is almost entirely arrested, and time is afforded for the formation HUcI hnn nn'nnsif'. ri"F q /^rvnnmlmv^ -i-r. ai,- « it -i T274 ARREST OF ARTERIAL IREMORRUAGE. ill the ReiracHon of tlio artery within its sheath, in the ConIrarMon of the ent ends, and in the Formation of a Coagulum around its exterior, and in its interior. When an artery is ent aeross, it immediately retracts within its sheath, the interior of which is left rough and uneven. Through this uneven channel the blood is projected, either flowing freely externally or being extravasated into the neighboin-ing areolar tissue, aecording to the direction and state of the Avound. As the blood flows over the roughened surface of the sheath, it becomes entangled in the flbres, and tends to coagulate upon them ; tliis tendency to coagulation is favoimed by the increased plasticity of the blood as it floAVS, and by the diminution of the propulsive force with AA'hich it is carried on. By the conjoined operation of these causes a coagulum is formed, AA'hich, though lying within the sheath, is outside the artery, and extends beyond it; and is hence tenned the external coagulum. It is usually somewhat cylindrical, and often looks like a continuation of the vessel, being at first perforated by a hollow track, through which the stream of blood conthmes to flow. As it increases in size, the hollow becomes closed by the concentric deposit of coagulum. The hoUow track leading fr-om the siu’face of the coagulum to the wmund in the artery, has been especially described and dwelt upon by Amussat. This coagulum acts mechanically by blocking up the end of the artery, and also by compressing the vessel wdthin the sheath; thus constituting the first barrier to the hmmorrhage. The formation of the extemal coaguhnn is thus in a great measure dependent on the retraction of the artery AAithiu its' sheath. The next changes that take place in the artery, and, indeed, that arc to a certam extent simultaneous with those that have just been described, are, its Contraction and the formation of Internal Coagulum. The Contraction of the cut artery commences immediately after its division, and may of itself be sufficient to close a small vessel. Thus, dining an operation, we may often see an artery Avhich, when first cut, spouted out a stream of blood as large as a straw, gTaclually contract in size luitil it ceases to bleed, owing simply to this contraction. In a larger artery this jn'oeess is not sufficient to completely close the vessel, but merely gives its cut end a conical shape, diminishing greatly the aperture in the artery, perhaps to the size of a pin-hole. In proportion as the open end of the artery is obstructed by the cxtei’ual coagulum and contracts in diameter, the blood is propelled Avith more and more difficulty through it, until at last it escapes in but a small and feeble ^ stream, or even becomes completely stationary, alloAidng its fibrine to be deposited m a slender coagulum, which plays a more important part in the peimanent than in the temporaiy aivest of the bleedhig. To the formation of this Internal Coagulum the contraction of the vessel is subservient. This coagulum is slender and conical, the base being attached to the margins of the apertime in the vessel, and the apex extending upwards. It has no point of attachment, except by its base, the apex and sides being perfectly free; at first it consists entirely of a film fibrinous coaguhmi, no exudative matter entering into its composition at this period, though important changes subsequently occur Avithin it. The importance of the internal coagulum as a temporary means275 PERMANENT CLOSURE OF ARTERY. of an-estijig- hfemoiThage, though gTcat, has, T think, been OA'crestimatod. It is not formed at all in certain states of the blood, when that fluid is devoid of iflasticity; and in some cases the joroximity of a collateral brancb to the cut end of the vessel appears, by preventing the stagnation of the blood witbiii it, to interfere with coagulation. Even when it is formed, it is of but little serviee, so far as the primary aiTCst of tbe liaBmonkage is coneerned, not being- deposited until after the flow of blood has been checked by other means, sucli as the deposit of the external coagulum and the contraction of the vessel. After it is fonned, it is useful hi acting as a damper, and in breaking the force of the wave of blood against the cut end of the vessel. It is in the permanent aiTcst of h^emon-hage that the internal coagulum is of great importance. After the hmmoiThage fi-om the cut artery has been arrested temporarily by the means that have been indicated. Nature proceeds to secure the A’essel by permanently occluding it. Perjiaxext Closure of a cut artery is effected by two processes: 1. Adhesion in the Vessel and in the Surrounding Parts. 2. Continued Contraction of the Artery. 1. Adhesion.—A few hours after the division of the artery, lymph is found to have been poured out both within and on the outside of the injiued vessel. The lymph that is thrown out within the vessel forms the most important part of the internal coagidum, and tends materially to the permanent closure of the wound. It is efPused from the cut sinface of the internal and middle coats, around and immediately vithin the contracted orifice of the vessel, forming a small nodule projecting into its interior. If an internal clot have already formed, this plastic nodule is deposited underneath it, or is effused into its base ; if no temporary clot have formed, a conical mass of coagulum Avill be deposited upon this nodule, in obedience to that law of pathology by which blood tends to coagulate upon inflamed points. When ftdly formed, this coagidum differs materially in structure at different points. At its base it is firm, of a brownish or buff coloiu, and is composed iwincipally of fibrine ; above this it becomes dark maroon-coloiued, and ends in a long tail-hke pro- jection of smiple clot, which extends up to the nearest large collateral branch. I he important part of this coagidum, pathologically speaking, is its plastic base : the rest, however long it may be, is of no use in the permanent closiue ? internal clot already described, merely serves to break the shock of the blood-stream. Coincidently with these changes in the interior of the vessel, imiiortant phemna oecur on its exterior. Exudation takes place in the sheath and m the_ sim-ounding parts, a round or ovoid mass of lymph being formed jyici IS y rst mixed up ivith the external coagulum ; the colouring matter acciimiilni gi’adually becomes absorbed, leaving the plastic material th^outs^ ""^P^^tely blocking up the end of the vessel fi-om fliifloi ^ 8'OCS on contracting, until it embraces the in- nomcd,fflonltyis cxporioncod in Beating thorn. That tht'^tutoi "d T 2276 ABREST OF ARTERIAL ILEMORRIIAGE. artery are not adherent I have ascertained by finding, on careful dissection, that the transverse sti’ite of the lining membrane of the artery are always visible, although the coats of the vessel are often stained nearly black by the imbibition of the coloiming matter of the lilood. The contracted vessel usually assumes a conical shape ; but in some cases I have seen the contraction com- mence suddenly, the narrowed part being perfectly cylindrical for the distance of about an inch. The changes that have just been described are those Avhich take place in the proximal end of the artery. In the distal or inferior end, occlusion is effected by processes essentially the same, but the retraction and contraction of the vessel are not so complete and extensive, and the coagulum is usually smaller both inside and outside ; in some cases, indeed, the internal coagulum is deficient. The less perfect closure of the distal end may, as Guthrie suggests, be the cause of the more frequent occurrence of haemon-hage from it. The idtimate change that takes place in the divided artery is the transforma- tion of its cirt extremity, up to the first collateral branch, into a dense fibro- cellular cord. This is effected by the plastic effusion inside and outside the artery, with the cut and contracted vessel in the centre, developing into fibro- cellular tissue, which becomes vascularised and incorporated with the adjacent arterial Avails. AeEEST of H.a:MOREHAGE FROM A PUNCTURED OR PARTIALLY DfVIDED Artery is effected in a somewhat different maimer from what has been just now described ; the difference consisting in the changes that go on in the neighboru’hood of the Avoimd. If the Avoimd in the soft parts coA'ering the artery be of small size and obhque in direction, so that the blood does not escape AAith too great facility, it aauII be found that the temporary arrest of the hsemorrhage takes place by an extrav’asation of blood occurring between the artery and its sheath, by AA'hich the vessel is not only compressed, but the rela- tions between the wound and the aperture in the sheath are altered. This stratum of coagulated blood extends for some distance Avithin the sheath, aboA'e and below the wound, opposite to which it is thicker than elsewhere. Coagulum may hkeAidse be formed in the tissues of the part outside the sheath, by which the vessel is still fruther compressed, and the tendency to the escape of blood proportionately lessened. The permanent closure of the pmictiue is effected by adhesive proeesses. Lymph may be effused in such a way as to be sufficient merely to plug the wound in the coats ; or it may obliterate the whole interior of the artery, pro- ducing complete occlusion of it. In order that the wound in the artery should unite simply by the formation of a cicatrix in the coats, Avithout obliterating the cavity of the vessel, it is necessary that it be below a certain size ; but this size will vary according to the direction of the Avound. If this be longitudinal or slightly oblique, it aatU be more likely to unite in this Avay than if transverse. Guthrie states that, in an artery of the size of the temporal, a small longitu- dinal Avound may sometimes heal AAdthout obliteration of the vessel, though this veiy rarely happens in larger arteries. If a large A'cssel, such as the femoi’al, be opened longitudinally to the extent of one-foiuth of its circum- ference, there is no proof that the AVOund can heal Avithout obliteration of the cavity of the arteiy ; but when a longitudinal Avouud in a large artery is veiy277 SURGICAL TREATMENT. small, little more than a puncture, closure may possibly take place simply by its cicatrisation. The plastic matter forming the cicatrix is thrown out by the external coat of the artery. The internal and middle coats do not unite strongly, the apertiu-e in them being merely filled up by a plug of lymph ; hence the artery always continues weak at this point, and may eventually become aneiu-ismal. If an artery of the second or third magnitude, as the axillary or femoral, be di\-ided to one-foiu'th or more of its circumference, either fatal hmmorrhage or the formation of a traimiatic aueiu’ism will take place, according to the size and more or less direct character of the external Avouud. In those compara- tively rare cases, however, in which the heemoiThage is arrested without these consequences ensuing, it will be found that it is so, by the vessel becoming obliterated by a plug of lymph, Avhich is poiu’ed out at the wounded part and gradually encroaches on the cavity of the artery, until complete obliteration is produced, and the vessel at the seat of obstruction becomes converted into a fibro-cellular cord. SURaiCAL TREATMENT OF ARTERIAL HAEMORRHAGE. The object of the Siu’geon, in any means that he may adopt for the suj)pres- sion of arterial htemoiThage, should be to imitate, hasten, or assist the natural processes, or to excite analogous ones. All his means act by one or other of the following methods :—1. By increasing the Retraction and Contraction of the arterial coats; 2. By forming an Artificial Coaguliun ; 3. By exciting Adhesive Exudation in and around the Vessel. The danger from arterial htemorrhage, and the measru’es that must be adopted to meet it, vary according to the size of the vessel. In all circumstances the Surgeon should bear in mind the excellent advice given by Guthrie, never to fear bleeding from any artery on which he can lay his finger, digital pressui’e readily controUing the blee^ng from the largest vessels, provided it can be fairly applied ; or the cut end of the artery may be seized between the finger and thumb. Thus, in amputation at the hip and shoulder-joints, the assistant readily controls the rush of blood from the femoral and axiUary arteries by paspmg- them between his fingers. Above all, the Surgeon should never dread femon age, nor lose his presence of mind when it occiu’s. If recourse be had to proper means, it can always be at least temporarily arrested. And on no accomit shoidd any one who pretends to the character of a Simgeon emnloy inefficient means to stop it, and imagine that he can, by covering up the wound vith rags, handkerchiefs, &c., prevent the escape of blood. These procedui-es only hide the loss that is going on, and, by increasing the warmth of the parts pi even e contraction of the vessels, and fa's’our the continuance of the bleed- iiig. n ei all circumstances, therefore, bleeding wounds should be opened up, e coagula gently removed ft-om their surface by means of a piece of soft sponge or a stream of cold water, and the part well cleaned.

The flow of blood through a limb may bo controlled for a fruinoiwv/mumose by'C dasl^brnd^ compression by the hand- y astic band—or by the tounnquet. The compression of the main artery278 ARIUCST OF ARTERIAL IREMORRHAGE. by the hands of an assistant may be done in the lower extremity by press- ing the femoral artery against the brim of the pnlhc bone, and in the upper extremity by compressing the subclavian against the first rib, or the brachial against the shaft of the hnmei’us. The pressure should Ije made by grasping the limb with one hand in such a way that the thumb bears upon the artery, and jn'esses it directly against the subjacent bone. If the limb be large, or if long- continued pressiu’c be required, the thmub of the other hand should be firmly applied upon that Avhich is already compressing the vessel (Fig, 5, page 3o). In some cases, especially when the subclavian or external iliac requires to be compressed, the handle of a large key, or the end of a desk seal, covered with leather, will be found the most convenient instrument for applying the pressure. In particular and exceptional mstances, where the artery has become un- usually deeply seated—as, for instance, where the clavicle has been pushed up above the subclavian by an anemismal tiimoiu’—and when ordinary means fail irr effecting a secure compressiorr of the vessel, a very effectual mode of con- trolliirg the flow of blood through it has been adopted by Syme. This consists irr making arr incision thi’ough the skin and superficial fascia over the artery, so that the fingers of the assistant may be brought to bear almost dhectly rrpon the vessel, which may thus be seciuely and effectually compressed. The use of the elastic barrd, or Esmarch’s bloodless method, has beerr described and figrrred at p. 29. Irr most cases, however, in which temporary compression of the ai’tery is rcqrrired, the Tourniquet shorrld be employed. It is far safer to trust to this iustrrrmerrt, tharr to the harrds of arr assistant, however steady and strong. "l^Trerr the tourrriquet is applied with a sufficierrt degnee of tightrress, the whole circrrlatiorr through the limb may be completely an’ested. This can rrever be dorre by the compressiorr of the mam trrurk alorre, the collateral arrd minor vessels corrveyirrg blood irrto the limb irrdeperrderrtly of it. Therr again, if the operatiorr be urrexpectedly jrrotracted from any cause, the firrgers of an assistant may tire or stiffen ; and, the steadiness of their pressm’e becoming relaxed, hremoiThage may ensue. For these reasorrs, Srugeons almost irr- variably employ the tommiquet irr amprrtations ; and even Liston, who at orre period of his earner discarded this instrument, commonly emjrloyed it druing the latter years of his life. In applying the tormriquet, care should be taken not to screw it up irntil the very momerrt wherr the compression is reqrrired, aird then to do so qrrrckly arrd with considerable force, lest venous congestion of the limb take place, owing to the veins being compressed before the circrrlatiorr irr the arteries is annsted. It is difficult to say how long complete arrest of the circrrlatiorr throrrgh a limb may be maintairred by the elastic band or the tourniquet without danger of gangTene. It must necessarily vary according to age. As a gerreral rule, I should say that Esmarch’s method might be used for about orre horrr, and the tormriquet for three hoiu’S with safety. The differerrt means that may be employed for the im-manent arrest ot hremorThage are, 1, the Appheatiorr of Cold ; 2, Stjqrtics ; 3, Oarrterisatiorr with the Hot Iron ; 4, Pressure ; 5, Flexion; 6, Torsion; 7, Ligatruc ; arrd 8, Acrrpressru-c. 1.

The mei*e exposiu’e of a wound, which has bled freely so long as it has been covered up by pledgets and bandages, to the cold air, is often sufficient. When this does not succeed, the application of a piece of lint, soaked in cold water, will usually arrest the flow of blood. When it is necessary to do this speedily, as in some operations about the air-passages, a small stream of cold Avater may be allowed to drip into the Avouud, and thus cause rapid contraction of the vessels, and consequent cessa- tion of bleeding. In cases of bleeding into some of the holloAV ca\ities of the body, as the rectum, vagina, or mouth, the apphcation of ice is advan- tageous, Its use should not, hoAvever, be too long continued, lest sloughing occiu'. Indeed, if cold do not speedily, almost at once, arrest the bleeding by constricting the vessels, it is better to have recourse to other and more efficient means. 2. Styptics aid powerfully the contraction of the vessels, and, by increasing the rapidity of formation and the firmness of the coaguliun, tend to arrest the hfBuiorrhage; they are principally used in oozing from spongy parts, or in bleeding frum caAuties or organs to which other applications cannot readily be made. The great objection to their employment in some wounds consists in their tendency to modify injiuiously the character of the siu’face, and to prevent imion by the first intention. The most useful styptics are the solution of perchloride of iron, spirits of tiu’pentine, gaUic acid, and matico ; the appli- cation of alum, or touching a bleeding part with a pointed stick of the nitrate of silver, is also serviceable. Of all these, the solution of the perchloride of iion, when injected into or apphed upon a bleeding part, acts as the readiest and most efficient ha3mostatic, coagulating the blood with remarkable rapidity, and into a very fii’m clot. In order to apply this or any other styptic effec- tually, the part should be wiped diy, aU coagula removed, and a piece of lint or cotton-Avool, soaked in the solution and then squeezed nearly dry, fii-mly apphed and maintained by the pressime either of the finger or of a pad and bandage. If the bleeding proceed from a mucous canal, this should be firmly plugged AA'ith the luit so prepared. 3. CAUTERISATION! by means of the red-hot iron Avas almost the only mode 0 anesting aiteiial htemoiThage that was knoAvn to the ancients. It is now comparatively seldom employed, but yet in many cases it is of the most un- questiona^ e utility, and sujierior to any other means that we possess ; more pai ici cU y in those cases in Avhich the ha3morrhage proceeds from a soft and poious part t at Avill not hold a hgatine, or from the siu'face of which many pom s appeal to be bleeding at the same time.

Pi’cssnre may bo practised in various ways. Sometimes the mere uniform compression ot a bandage is sufficient to airest the haemorrhage; thus oozing from a wound may often be stopped by laying domi the flaps, and ajeplying a bandage rather tightly over them. Sometimes a weight applied upon this will tend still fiu-ther to arrest the bleeding ; as, for mstance, by means of a shot or sand-bag laid upon the part. In the case of bleeding from hollow cavities, as the rectum, vagina, or nares, the haemorrhage may be arrested by the pressure of a plug of sponge or lint, to which sometimes a styptic may advantageously be added. T\Tien the hfemorrhage proceeds from the pimctme of a small or moderate-sized artery, as of the temporal or brachial, pressure should be made against the adjacent bone by means of a graduated compress and bandage, and should be continued until complete consolidation of the wound has taken jjlace, the vessel becoming obhterated. The (jraduated compress should be at least an inch in thickness, and made of a series of pledgets of lint of a circular shape, gradually diminishing in size. It should be applied with its pointed end resting over the wound in the vessel. In applying it, care should be taken that the part on which the pressme is to be exercised has been thoroughly dried of all blood, and that the artery is commanded above the wound by a toiuiiiquet, or by the pressure of an assistant’s fingers. A thick slice of a phial-cork, or a fourpeimy piece, snapped in lint, being placed on the woimd, the graduated compress should be bandaged tightly over the whole. When applied in this way, pressme acts by inducing adhesive inflammation and obliteration of the vessel at the point compressed. 5. Forcible Flexion, as a means of arresting hsemon-hage from the arteries of the limbs, has in recent years been advocated by Heath of Newcastle, Adehnann of Dorpat, and others. Its appheation is founded on the fact, specially pointed out in 1843 by Formey, that flexion of the arm at the elbow-joint weakens or arrests the pulsation at the wrist. Malgaigne, Vidal, Fleiuy, Fry, and some other Siu’geons, have reported cases in which the plan was employed successfully; Imt until lately the method has attracted little attention. Heath, from a number of experiments made by him in the Newcastle Infirmary, has foimd that flexion of the arm at the elbow, or of the leg at the knee, diminishes or ainests the pulse in the distant arteries. In this respect he confirms the observations of Hyrtl and others ; but he finds also that in the aim the process is greatly aided by placing a piece of lint or a handkerchief rolled up in the bend of the elbow; and in the lower limb, by bending the thigh on the abdomen at the same time that the leg is bent at the knee. Where flexion acts successfully as a means of harmostasis—as it is reported to have done in several cases, especially in womids of the palmar* ■ arteries and the vessels of the fore-arm—it probably does so by weakening the current of blood, so as to favoru* the closme of the arterial wound in ^the manner described in speaking of the Natural Arrest of Htcmoiihage. The apparent simplicity and safety (when carefully applied) of flexion render it ■worthy of further trial in cases of injury of the arteries of the fore-arm and hand or of the leg and foot. A roU of lint or other soft material having been jrlaced in the flexure of the joint, the limb should be bent rmtil it is281 TORSION OF ARTERIES. perceived that the h£emoiThagc is an-ested, and should then he maintained in position by moans of a handkerchief or bandage. Care must of course be taken not to exercise too great compression, by which gangrene nught be produced. The flexion should be kept up till the Surgeon, by careful exami- nation, is satisfled that there is no fimther risk of hfemoirhage. G. Torsion of Cut Arteries for the arrest of haamoirhagc is mentioned by Galen but the practice seems to have been forgotten until about 1828. It was rerived in France by Amussat, Velpeau, and Thierry; and in Geimany by Fricke, who experimented upon and practised this method of treating divided arteries, vuth much ingenuity aud perseverance. But, notwithstandmg the efforts made to force it on the attention of Surgeons, it was gradually abandoned, even by its strongest advocates. Torsion has never found much favour amongst Sm’geons in this country, and has, perhaps, been too much neglected. Of late years it has, however, again been revived, chiefly in Fig. 111.—Torsion of Bracliial Artery connection irith and by the advocates of the “ Antisejitic Treatment,” and by those who have been anxious to do away with the use of the ligatm’e, as being injurious in many ways, and more especially in regard to the direct union of woimds, particularly in plastic and other similar operations where t e presence of a ligature is very liable to occasion in-itation and suppuration. oision may be practised in various ways. Thus, Amussat recommends at the artery be draivn out for about half an inch by one pair of forceps ; seized at its attached end with another forceps, and that off ^^30ut a dozen tunis.

In seizing the nrtoiy it is peculiarlyAPdlEST OF ARTERIAL HjEMORRIIAGE. 282 iiupoifcaiifc, as Dupuytren has pointed out, that the whole vessel be gvasped by the forceps, and that care be taken not to introduce one blade into the open end of the \essel, and thus only twist half of it. There can be no doubt that hiumorrhage from the largest vessels may be cflcctually stopped by torsion. Amussat and Velpeau reputedly used it to close the femoral, brachial, ulnar, and radial arteries in amputations of the thigh, arm, and foreaiTU. In torsion, an artery is placed in the condition of one that is lacerated or toru through. The internal and middle coats are retracted, and the external one is twisted into a kind of screw beyond them. A coagulum next forms Avithin the vessel, blocking up its extremity; inflammation then takes place, gluing together the coats of the artery; the twisted end sloughs off, and the vessel becomes occluded up to the nearest collateral branch. Torsion and Ligature Compared.—The employment of torsion as a sub- stitute for the ligatiu'e is adA'oeated on three gvounds : 1, that, whilst equally safe, it is more easy of apjAlication ; 2, that it is less liable to be followed by secondary htemorrhage ; and 3, that Avhen an artery is closed by torsion, no foreign body is left in the wound that could interfere with its direct union. Let us briefly examine these assumed advantages of torsion over the ligature. 1. So far as ease of application is concerned, there can be no doubt that the advantage is in favoiu’ of the ligatme. This is especially and very markedly the case with small vessels and those that camiot be drawn out of the sheath. In the case of the larger arteries, that can be denuded and di’awn out of the neighbouring tissues, it is at least as easy to thi'ow a thread roiuid the exposed vessel as to Lvist it up securely. 2. With reference to the comparative freedom from secondary hremorrhage, we have feAV data. This accident so rarely follows the use of the hgatme in open woimds, that it is scarcely to be taken into account as a somce of danger; and Avhen it does occim, it arises from causes, such as a diseased state of the tissues and blood, that are equally independent of hgatm’e and of torsion. And if secondary hemorrhage rarely follows torsion of an artery, the same may be said Avith equal truth AAuth respect to its hgatme. 3. The torsion of arteries Avas strongly advocated on the ground that, Avhilst equally as safe as the ligatme, there Avould after its employment be less hability to inflammation and suppm-ation, as no foreign body was left in the woimd. This argument was especially used by Amussat, who stated that, as the emplo}Tnent of torsion reduces the inflammation and suppuration of a wound almost to nothing, the cicatrisation must necessarily be more rapid. This statement, however, was not borne out by exiAcrience; and no difference Avas observable in that respect betAveen the healing of Avoimds m Avhich the vessels had been tied and those Avhere they had been twisted. ^ It a\ as hence considered that the advantage assumed for torsion over the ligatme m this respect Avas more fanciful than real; and Velpeau, aaLo A\ as one of its earliest imd staiuichest advocates, admitted, after a prolonged experience of it, that torsion was not applicable in every case, and that in none did it possess any ica advantage over the ligatiu’e. The question as to the injmious influence exercised by the ligature as aLIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 28' foreign body in the healing of Avounds Avill be discussed when avg come to conipiure the relatiA'C merits of acupressure and the ligature as a means ol arresting htemon-hage (p. But the cpiestion as to AA'hether, in em- ploying torsion, Ave completely clear the Avound of all foreign bodies and succeed in preventing the injurious interposition of a substance that is detrimental to the healing process, may be considered here. We must discuss this question according as torsion is applied to the larger or to the smaller arteries. When a large ai’tery, such as the femoral or brachial, is tAvisted for the arrest of ha3moiThage, it is di'aAAUi out of its sheath, the A'ascular connections AAuth Avhich ai’e disturbed or broken thi’ough; the end that is tAvisted is seA'erely pinched and bniiscd ; the internal and middle coats are broken through and turned back, Avhilst the external one is screAved into a tight tAvist beyond these ; and this, together AAuth the tinning back of the separated internal and middle coats, foims the obstacle to the escape of blood, the coagTdum forming above tliis point exactly as in the case of a hgatm-ed artery. Manec, in his classical AA'ork on the ligatine of the arteries, Avrote as folloAA'S. “ The extremity of the tAA'isted arteiy and the fragments of the internal and middle coats constitute a foreign body;—these parts of the vessel, beuig severely bruised by the torsion, maintain no connection A\ith the surroimding tissues, are unable to form any adhesion to them, and can only be removed by the conjoined action of suppination and absorption.” Manec further states as the result of his experiments that, Avhen he applied the hgature to the main arteiy of one limb and employed torsion upon the corresponding vessel of the other, he almost alAvays found that the Avomid cicatrised more easily AA^hen the artery Avas tied than Avhen it Avas tAA'isted. Thus it Avould aj)pear that the result of praetical experience and of experiment tend to shoAV that the tivisted end of a Large artery is m reahty a foreign body; and that in this respect torsion, A\hen applied to the principal arteries of a limb, presents no adA'antage over the ligatiu’e. But the case is undoubtedly different Avith the smaller arteries. Here the vessel need not be diaAAii out or detached fr'om smTounding parts ; and consequently there is not the same injury inflicted upon its free end.' The meie pinching and moderate tivisting of the bleeding point aaoU be sufiicient to anest the hiemon’hage from it. And in these cases, but in these only, torsion appears to me to possess a decided advantage over the ligatme. This is nioro particularly the case Avhen, as in plastic operations, direct union is of the first importance, and the presence of the knot and thread of the ligature AA'ould inff^ilily leave a suppm-ating track. lere IS one condition ot an artery that is an insuperable obstacle to the successful employment of torsion, viz., the calcification of its coats. In such cases, carbohsed catgut or thick silken ligatures can alone be used AA'ith safety. 7. Lioature is the means to AAliich Surgeons commonly have recourse for the arrest of hiemon-hage fr-om Avounded arteries vimn occasionally and partially employed by the later completely into disuse, giving Ai'ay to such barbarous and inefficient I284 ARREST OF ARTERIAL ILEMORRIIAGE. inodes of arresting the haemorrhage as tlic employment of tlic axetnal cautery, the performance of operations ndth red-hot knives, or the application of boiling pitch, or of molten lead, to the bleeding and freshly cut surface. About the middle of the sixteenth century, it was revived or reinvented by that great luminary of the French school of Surgery, Ambroise Par6. But so slowly did the ligatiu’c make way, that Sharpe, Surgeon to Guy’s Hosjiital, writing in 1701, two centmies after its re-introduction by Par6, found it necessary, in his well-known work, entitled, “A Critical Enquiry into the Present State of Simgcry,” formally to advocate its employment for the amst of hasmorrhage from wounded arteries, in jircference to styptics or the cautery, on the groimd that “ it was not as yet universally practised amongst Sm-geons residing in the more distant counties of our kingdom.” 'V\Tiat, it may be asked, was the reason that it took two centmies to promulgate the use of the simplest and most efficacious means we possess in smgery for the arrest of heumorrhage—a simple tying up of a spoutmg artery—a means that no Surgeon could now for a day dispense vith ? The reason simply was, that Siu’gcons were totally ignorant of the means employed by Natme for the occlusion of arteries ; that they consequently did not know how to apply a ligatime to these vessels, or what kind of ligatme should be used ; and that, in their anxiety to avoid the rcciu’rence of secondary hEemorrhage, and to make aU safe, they fell into the very errors they would have endeavomed to avoid, had they been acquainted vith the physiology of the processes by which Nature accomplishes the closure of the artery and the separation of the thread. Between twenty and thirty years after the time at which Shai*pe VTote, Hunter introduced that gi’eat improvement in the surgical treatment of aneiu’ism—the deligation of the artery at a distance from the sac, and in a healthy part of its coiu’se ; but this great accession to the treatment of a most formidable disease was but coldly received, and ran some risk of being lost to the world in consequence of the ill-success that attended the earher operations. In Hunter’s ffi’st operation, four ligatiu’es were used, all of which were applied so slackly as merely to compress the artery for some distance, in order to avoid too gTeat a degree of pressime at any one point; the artery was denuded, so that a spatula could be passed under it. Although in his subsequent operations Hiuiter contented himself with employing but one ligature, yet sometimes the vein was included in this ; and he did not draw the noose tight for fear of injm-ing the coats of the vessel, in accordance vdth the doctrine of the day— Surgeons generally at this tune being haiuited with the dread of injiuing, and thereby weakening, the coats of the artery; and, in order to avoid doing so, they adopted modes of treatment that almost infallibly led to ulceration of the '\’esscls and consecutive hcemorrhage. The application of seveial ligatmes of reserve, applied slack—the use of broad tapes the intei’position of plugs of cork, wood, agaric, or lead, or of rolls of hut or plaster, between the thread and the vessel, were some amongst the plans that were in common use. And how can we be siu’prised that the patients pciished of haemoiihage, and that hgatime of the vessel was nearly as inefficient and fixtal a means of arresting bleeding as the use of a cautery, or ot a button of white Aitiiol ? Jones, by an appeal to experiment, and by means of a series of admiia^ y conducted investigations on living animals, showed that the veiy point w ucPRINCIPLES OF LIGATURE. 285 Snr«-eons were anxious to avoid—the division of the coats of the vessel by the tio-hteniug of the noose—was that on which the patient’s safety depended ; he also pointed out the form and size of ligature that was most safe, the degree of force with Avhich it should he applied, and the processes adopted by nature for the occlusion of the vessel. "Chus a more rational practice was uitroduced, and then for the first time Sm-geons had full confidence in the use of the ligatiu’C. Principles of Treatment of Wounded Arteries by Ligature.—The whole of the doctrine of the general treatment of wounded arteries by ligature may be included in two great principles •. 1. To cut directly doion on the wounded and to tie the vessel there; and 2. To aioply a ligature to both ends, if it be completely divided, or to tlie distal as luell as the proximal side of ths wound, if it be merely punctured. These principles of treatment were distinctly laid dovm by John Bell ;* but, although this great Smgeon inculcated forcibly these rules of practice. Surgeons appear to have been led away by the erroneous idea of applying the Hunterian principles in the treatment of aneurism to that of wounded arteries, imtil Guthrie, by his practice and precepts, and by adducing an overwhelming mass of proof to bear on this important question, recalled the attention of the Profession to the proper and rational treatment of wounded arteries. 1, The principal reason in favoiu’ of cutting doivn directly upon the ‘wounded part of the injured vessel is, that the ligature of the main trunk at a distance above it only stops the direct supply of blood to the limb, but does not inter- fere with the indirect or anastomosing circulation, by which means the blood readily passes into that portion of the vessel which is beyond the ligature, and continues to escape from the distal apertme of the wound. Thus, though bright arterial blood may no longer jet from the upper part of the wound, blood which has become of a dark colom in consequence of the changes to which it is subjected in its passage through the vascular network of the limb, will continue to well out from the lower apertme in the artery, entailing the necessity of fm’ther operative interference to restrain its flow ; and, unless this be done, the patient will die of hEemorrhage as smely, though perhaps not qiu'te so speedily, as if no ligature had been applied. Thus, if a Surgeon endeavom’ to arrest the flow of blood from a wound of the ulnar artery near the pahn by ligaturing the brachial in the middle of the arm, and, when the blood bursts forth as furiously as e^er, apply successive ligatmes to the arteries of the forearm Avith as Kttle success ; he Avill at last, on account of the continued reciui’ence of hmmorrhage, be forced to adopt the simple expedient that ought to have been had recourse to in the first instance, namely, ligatming the A^essel at the point womided. Another reason for the practice noAv advocated is, that in some cases the Shirgeon cannot possibly know what artery is injured unless he seek for it in the Avound itself. A large artery may, Irom the direction of the stab and the impetuous floAv of blood that has foUoAved it, appear to be Avoimded, AA'hen in reality it is only a minor branch that has been injmed. Thus, for instance in cemoiThage from a stab in the axilla, Avhich proved fatal, notAvithstanding the igature of the subclaAdan artery for supposed Avound of the axillary the loiu'- loiacic Avas found to be the vessel divided ; so also the external iliac artery • * “ rrinciples of Surgery,” vol. i., pp. 350, 390, Svo. edit.ABBE ST OF ABTEBIAL 1FEM0B.BJ1AGE. 286 has been ligatured for supposed wound of the common femoral, wlieu in reality it was the external pudic that was injured. The rule of cutting down on the injured part of the artery applies to all cases in which the wound is still open, whatoA-er bo its condition. Howe\'er deep, inflamed, and sloughy the Avound ; hoAA'CA’er ill-eonditioned and infiltrated Avith pus or blood the neighbouring parts may be, it may be stated as a general rule, to Avhich, hoAA'OA’er, there are some exceptions, ospeeially in Avomids of the palmar arch, or of the secondary branches of the carotid, that there is no safety to the patient unless the artery be cut down upon and tied at the part injured. This must alAA'ays be done at any period after the receipt of the injury, so long as there is an external wound communicating AAuth the artery. An operation of this kind is often attended A\ith the greatest possible difficulty, not only OAAung to the hasmorrhage that usually accompanies it and obscures the parts, but also in consequence of the inflamed, infiltrated, and sloughy conditiou of the tissues in the wound. In order to moderate the heemorrhage, the pressure of an assistant’s finger on the artery high up in the limb must not be trusted to ; but a tourniquet should be applied so as completely to arrest the circulation through the limb, and thus to facilitate the discoA'ery and exposine of the injured vessel, the Avound being dry. The application of an elastic bandage, such as that recommended by Esmarch, may be used Avith adA'antage to exsanguinate a limb, in which an artery has been Avouuded. By means of this excellent device the diAdded A'essel may be safely cut doAA'ii upon and dissected out as readily as in the dead body. A large probe should then be passed to the bottom of the woimd ; and, taking this as the centre, a free incision should be made in such a direction as may best lay open the cavity Avith the least injiny to the muscles and other soft parts. After timiing out any coagula contained in the wound, and clearing it as Avell as j)ossible, the injured A’essel must be sought for. The situation of this may sometimes be ascertained at once by the gaping of the cut in its coats. In many cases, hoAveA’er, it is necessary to relax the pressine upon the artery, so as to alloAA’ a jet of blood to escape, and thus indicate the position of the apertine. The ligature may then be applied by passing an aneinism-needle under the A’essel, if it be pai’tially divided ; or, if it be completely cut across, by draAving forwards the end and ligatining it, as in an open wound. In doing this, care must be taken that the hgature be really applied to the vessel, and that a portion of the sheath infiltrated AA’ith blood,^ or thickened by adherent coagulum, be not mistaken for the artery. In applying the ligature under the circumstances here indicated, A’iz., in a wound that is sloughy and suppurating, the tissues vdll necessarily in a gi-eat degi-ee haA’c lost their cohesion and firmness ; and although the arterial tissue resists the disor- ganising influence of low inflammatory action much longer than areolar or muscular tissue, yet it will also have become softened and less resistant. Hence the vessel must be isolated Avith gentleness and care, and the ligature very care- fully tied—no undue force being used. The ligature a\u11 usually separate m such cases sevml days before the ordinary time. The incisions dorm to the wounded artery should generally be made on the side of Uie imnnd m ther ossci, and through the wound in the soft tissues covering it. Guthrie, hoAAeACi, advises that, in those cases in which the AVOund passes indirectly o the prin- cipal ai’tcry fr’om the back.or outside of the limb, the Surgeon need not follow287 APPLICATION OF LIGATURE. the track of the wound, but may cut down on the vessel where it lies nearest the sin-face ; then, on jiassing a probe through the wound, the spot at which the artery has probably been injured will be pointed out, and the ligatin-c must then be applied in the way usual in cases of primary hasmon-hage. Iuy)r/k«r//ha3morrhage from Avound of an artery, no operation should be undertaken unless the bleeding be actually continuing. If the bleeding have been an-ested, however furious it may have been, the Surgeon should never, unless it binst forth again, search for the v^ounded vessel, nor undertake any operation. A man was brought to the University College Hospital unth a deep stab in the gi-oin, directly in the course of the external iliac artery ; a A'ery large cpiantity of arterial blood had been lost, but the hiemorrhage was arrested on his admission by the a]jplication of pressure, &c. From the gi-eat* and sud- den loss of blood it was supposed that the external iliac had been pmictured, but it was not thought adAusable to perform any operation mdess hiemorrhage recim-ed. The bleeding did not return, the wound healing Avithout any ftn-ther trouble. In secondary hemorrhage the case is different. There the Surgeon must be prepared to seem-e the vessel, even though bleeding have for the time ceased. 2. The second great principle in the treatment of woiuided arteries is, that the ligature is to he applied to loth ends of the vessel, if it he completely cut across; or on loth sides of the aperture in it, if it le only partially divided. The reason for this rule of practiee is foimded on physiological grounds as well as on practical experience. If the anastomoses of the part be very free, as in the arteries of the palm or forearm, bleeding may continue from the distal end, uninteiTupted by the ligatm-e on the proximal side of the wound. If they be less fr-ee, it aaIII probably issue in a stream of dark-looking venous blood in the coiu’se of tA\m or three days. After the collateral circulation has been sufficiently estabhshed, bright scarlet blood avIU burst forth fr-om the distal aperture. Experience has shoAni that it is in this AA'ay that secondary hiemor- rhage fr-om woimdcd arteries commonly ocem-s, the bleeding coming fr-om the distal and not fr-om the proximal end of the vessel. In some cases the distal end is so retracted and coA-ered in by siu-rounding parts, that it cannot be found in order to be ligatiu-ed. In these circum'^ stances, the best effect has resulted fr-om plugging- the wound fr-om the bottom with a gi-aduated sponge-oompress. If an arterial branch happen to be divided so close to Its origin that it cannot he seeured, the case must be treated as one of punctm-e of the main trunk, which must be ligatiu-ed above and below the bleeding orifiee. Although advocating strongly the importance of the distal as AA^ell as the proximal ligature in all cases of Avounded artery, I am aAA'are that instances are on record in which the proximal ligatiu-e alone, even at a distance fr-om the Avouiid, has proved suecessful in arresting the hemorrhage ; but I caimot but i-egard those cases as accidentally successful, the distal end having been better p ugge than usual Awth coaguliim ; and I am strongly of opinion that the rule of pmctice should be that Avliich is laid doAvn by John Bell, and ffi^trated by Guthrie, aIz. :_That both ends of a Avounded artery be soimhi for, and tied in the wound itself. ® Ligature.—The mode of applieation of the lio-atnre e nnd of ligature to bo used, vary according as, 1, the cut end of theARliEST OF ARTERIAL lUEMORRUAQE. 288 artery lias to be tied in an open wound, or as, 2, the vessel has to be secured in its continuity. 1. When the divided vessel in an open ivound has to be tied, as after an amputation, the mouth of the artery must be seized and drawn forwards (Fig. 112). For this piu'pose a tenaculum, or sharp hook, is frequently used, and in many cases answers the purpose exceedingly well. There are, however’, some objections to this instrument; thus, it occasionally seizes other tissues with the artery, and, as it draws the vessel forwards by perforating its coats, it has happerred that, air accidental punc- tiu’e haA'diig been made by it behind the part to which the ligature is applied, rrlceration of the vessel and subsequent fatal heemorr’hage have ensued, as I have seen in one case. The most convenient instrirmeirt for the pm-pose of drawing forward the artery, aird one to which iro objection whatever apphes, is Liston’s “ bull- dog” forceps. These have been conveniently modified by having the blades exparrded just above the points (Fig. 113), so that the ligatm’e can be shpped over the end of an arter’y that is deeply seated, as between bones or close to the interosseous membrane of the leg—a situation in which it is sometimes troublesome to tie a vessel by any other means. In some cases the bleeding point may be so situated, that the ligature is most conveniently passed under and round it by means of an ordinary ciuved needle. The kind of ligature used must vary according to the size of the vessel. If this be small, fine rorurd twine ; if large, dentist’s silk, or compressed smooth whip- cord, should be employed. Fig. 113—Liston’s “BuU-clog” Forceps, Biodified. latter should alwayS be used in ligaturing the main artery of a limb. Before being used, the material should be well waxed, so that it may not be too limp ; its strength should be tested by knotting it with a jerk, and, if found efficient, it may be cut up for use in pieces eighteen inches in length. In applying the ligatiue, care must be taken that it be put well over the cut end of the artery that it clear the points of the for- ceps, and that it be tied tightly in a knot, which does not shp (Fig. 114). One end of the ligature should then be cut off about a quarter of an inch from the knot, and the other left hanging out of the wound. The ligature Fig. Ii4.-Tiie Ligature-Liwt. geciu’es the main artery should have both its ends knotted together, by way of a distinctive mark. It is better to leave289 LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. one end of the ligature ; if both be cut off, the noose and knot left arc apt to become enveloped by granulations, and, after the healing process is well ad- vanced, or perhaps completed, to give rise to suppuration in and re-opening of the wound. The ligature that hangs out of the wound acts as a seton, giving rise to a track of suppuration along its course, along which the secretions of the wound may drain away. The end of the artery which is included in the noose, and which projects beyond it, sloughs, and thus acts as a foreign body in the woimd. When the artery that is tied is small, the end disintegrates and breaks doum in the discharges ; when it is large, it separates, often attached to the noose of the ligature when that has ulcerated through the portion of the A'essel that has been tied, coming away mth the ligature through the unhealed ligatiu’e-track. These inconveniences are inseparable from the use of the ligatm-e, but may be materially lessoned by the Surgeon bringing the threads out at the lower angle of the wound, and thus allowing the discharges to escape at the most dependent part. 2. When the artery has to be hgatured in its coniinuity, but at the point wounded, it must be exposed by as careful a dissection as the state of the parts will admit. If a Surgeon determine to apply a ligatui-e at a distance from the injiuy, his anatomical knowledge wiU guide him to the vessel. This is usually done by cutting thi’ough the tissues in the course of the vessel; HargTave, •however, recommends that, in ligaturing arteries, the incisions should not be made parallel to the com’se of the vessel, but in an obhque or transverse direc- tion over it; and this suggestion appears to me to be deserving of attention in some situations, more particularly in the ligatm'e of the brachial at the bend of the arm, or of the carotid at the root of the neck. The Siu’geon is usually guided to the vessel by some fixed fine or point, as the edge of a muscle, which has a determined and constant relation to the artery. Thus, in exposing the brachial, he cuts along the inner border of the biceps. In some cases, however, as in the hgature of the iliac arteries, no such certain anatomical guide exists, and then an imaginary line is drawn between two fixed points—as the umbilicus and the centre of Poupart s ligament—which becomes the guide to the coiu’se of the vessel. These “ directing lines ” should be carefriUy studied and kept in In making the first incision, the skin should be put on the stretch by the fingers of the left hand, or by those of an assistant. If the artery be super- ficial, or if there be parts of importance in its vicinity, the incision should not penetrate deeper than the skin. But if the vessel be deeply seated and no parts of importance intervene, it may be carried at once tlu’ough the sub- cutaneous areolar tissue, until the fascia covering the artery is exposed. This must then be 2iinched up with the forceps, and opened by the edge of the scalpel laid horizontally. Through this opening a grooved director may then e passed, and the fascia incised on it, without risk to subjacent parts. The s eath of the vessel is now exposed by a little careful dissection ; and the next step of the operation, Avhich consists in exposing the artery and separatino- it from Its accompanying vein, is one of great delicacy. This is done bv ninclfiuo- up the sheath with t.ho fm-f./vno o-,.a i—.-j?- i ^ mind. uARHEST OF ARTERIAL ILEMORRIIAGE. 290 cause it to be wounded. The artery having thus been exposed, the Siu’gcou seizes one edge of the sheath with the forceps, and, putting it on the stretch, proceeds to clean the artery, gently separating it from its accompanying vein by teazmg through the areolar connections nnth a director; being careful not to expose it to a greater extent than is absolutely necessary for the passage of the ligatin’e, lest subsequent sloughing of the vessel ensue, as a consequence of the destruction of the vas- cidar connections between it and the sheath (Fig. 116), but at the same time being careful to clean thoroughly the part to be tied. In opening the sheath, care should be taken not to wound any small branch, lest the collateral supply be interfered Fig. 115.—Exposure with, and danger of secondary hsemoiThage induced. The sheathr'“"° edge in the opening of the sheath being held tightly in the forceps so as to be rendered tense (Fig. 117), the ligatm-e should then be carefully passed between the vein and artery, care being taken to include only ^'ti ^'vessels ^'5' HT.—Passage of tlie Xeedle and Ligature, exposed. the latter, and especially not to transfix and include a portion of the vein ; an accident that often terminates fataUy by phlebitis or gangrene. So also the Smgeon must be on his guard not to mistake any contiguous nerve for the artery, as has happened to the most experienced operators ; and also to aAoid transfixing and tying a portion of the thickened sheath instead of the vessel, as I have known happen to a most excellent Siu’geon. n t t ? ^ The Tyinri of the Artery and the consequent Division of the Internal ana Middle Coats shoidd be done evenly, smoothly, and compl^ely, so as Jo leave a wound that reatlily Ukes on tho adhesive inflammation.

Tims a siltMODIFICATIONS OF LIGATURE. 291 culamous section, as it were, is elfecteci; and this, like all similar wounds, takes on adhesive action. The adhesion between the coats is much facilitated by the pressm-e of the ligature, which acts as a support to the A'essel. The best material for Vujaiure, when applied to the continuity of an artery, is dentist’s silk, compressed whipcord, Avell Avaxed, or carbolised catgut, tied in a knot, as represented in fig. llf. Much ingenuity has been expended in devising instruments for passing the ligature under the artery. In the majority of cases the common aneurism-needle—Avell ground doAvn, but rounded at its extremity is all that is required. Occasionally it maybe adA'antageous to use a needle with a small curve. Many ingenious contrivances have been devised by Trant, Weiss, Coxeter, and others, for seizing and draAving forward the noose from the bottom of the wound. After the ligature has been passed under the vessel it should be tied tightly with a reef-knot, and both its ends left hanging out of the Avoimd. The limb should then be elevated and be lightly covered AAuth a piece of flannel, or cotton-Avadding ; cai’e being taken not to apply pressure of any kind. Modifications of the Ligature.—With the view of diminishing or re- moving the various inconveniences, real or supposed, that result from the use of the ligatiue, and especially AAuth the object of promoting union of the Avound by the first intention, four methods haA'e been employed by Surgeons :—1, The use of Temporaiy Ligatures; 2, Cutting the Ends off close to the Knots; 3,’ The use of Wire to tie the ai-tery; and 4, The employment of materials for the Ligatm-e that might be Absorbed in the Wound. 1. The use of the Temporary Ligature in one of its modifications has already been attended to. This subject fully occupied the attention of Surgeons m this coimtry nearly half a century ago, and has now in a great measure become matter of history, for the study of which I must refer to the writings I however, state, that the general the foUoAAoAg^^^^^™^^^^ experience derived on this subject, is cmotid arteiy of a horse at tln-ee or form different points, with as many liga- expertaen^s, as foifoncVoTI left in for several hours, or even Chert C, r' ‘'™"™ ’ of the artery ensued, llohclts applied a ligature to the femoral artery for popliteal aneui-ism and irSy 1/1 ir 'r bmir« oKf • 1 ^ oian, and, on removing the ligature at the end of ScarpL andTltZ I'esult.

The practice of Cutting off the Ends of the Ligature close to the knot, has been adopted by many Surgeons in the hope that it might either be absorbed, or, at least, that the irritation of the wound resulting from the dependent threads might be prevented. This practice was at one tune much advocated by LawTcnce ; but, though employed by him at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in many cases of amputation, excision of the breast, and removal of the testicles, it Avas relinquished by him for more than thirty years before his death. He found that the noose and knot of the finest silk thread, such as is used for fish-fines, did not weigh more than the one-fortieth of a grain, \Aken cut close to the vessel. But, although some success attended the earlier use of the method, it was soon foimd that even this small quantity, together Avith the tied end of the vessel, set up hritation, gave rise to abscess, and was injurious : hence its abandonment in all cases in Avhich the wound is closed AAuth the vieAv to speedy union. When the wound is left open to granulate, Siu’geons com- monly adopt this plan of treatment. 3. The use of Wire Ligatures is altogether of American origin. It origi- nated Avith Physick and Levert of Alabama, who performed several experiments Avith threads of gold, silver, platinum, and lead. They found that A\ith these the arteries of animals could be successfully tied, and that, the material of the ligature being uninitating, no evil from suppuration ensued. When the ends of the ligature Avere cut off close to the A’essel, it AA'as found that the small metafile noose became embedded in a cellular capsule. For some reason, this means fell into disuse, until it Avas reAuved by Marion Sims. At his suggestion I tried it in several cases of amputation and other surgical operations, but have long since abandoned it, as I found great inconvemences resulting from its use. If the ends of the Avue were left out of the wound, the noose became embedded in a mass of plastic matter, did not separate, and, after several weeks, required considerable force to detach and disconnect it. If the ends were cut short, the sides of the wound healed OA^er them; they became encapsided, but were by no means innocuous ; in some cases giving rise to severe neiualgia of the stump by pressiue on and irritation of neighbom’mg neiwes ; in others, after some weeks, causing localised chcumscribed abscesses to form. 4. The employment of Ligatures made of Materials that admit of Absorption in the wound has been a favoiuite idea with many Siugeons, and is one on which much experimental ingenuity has at various times been ex- pended : for the idea is a captivating one, and if it could be safely, certainly, and successfully carried out in practice, it would undoubtedly remove one of the obstacles to the union of wounds by direct adhesion. With this view, it was proposed to substitute ligatiues made of animal substances for the ordiiiai-y threads made of hemp. Silk thi-ead was used by LaAiuence ui 1815, and at first with success, union of the wound taking place in foui to six ays, vn 1011 suppuration. But other Sm-geons failed in this, and LaAiTence liimsc f Avas soon compelled to give it up from want of good results m Ins subsequent cases. Wardrop substituted the gut of the silk-worm made into a ne cor , u aa equally unsatisfactory results.293 CATGUT LIGATURES. Catgut was used by Sir Astley CoojDcr as a material that was more likely to dissolve or to be absorbed than silk in any shape. The first cases in which it was employed as a ligatm-e were full of promise. In one, a patient aged eighty, the wound healed in foim days, and in another in twenty, and in neither did the noose of the ligatime re-appear. Whether it was absorbed or encapsuled does not clearly appear. But other Surgeons failed to imitate this success ; the catgut was foitnd to be too weak, and the distinguished author of the practice could not himself' maintain his first success with it, and eventually fell back on the ordinary hempen thread. Strips of deer-skin were used by Jameson, of Philadelphia, and other American Surgeons about the same time, probably in 1814, before Lawrence’s or Cooper’s experiments. They were found to answer better than either silk or catgut, being stronger, more elastic, and more readily soluble. These, however, also fell into disuse, for what reason does not clearly appear. The idea of the emj)loyment of hgatimes made of animal substances, that w’ould admit of absorption, and thus allow the wound to be immediately closed over the noose, so as in fact not to act as foreign bodies in the wound or as agents of suppm-ation, stiU occasionally presented itself to the minds of Sur- geons ; and, amongst others, Velpeau speaks of it with favom’, admitting, however, that their precise natine and form have to be determined. Of late the use of catgut has been revived by Lister, in connection with his “ Antiseptic Method ” of dressing wounds. He uses the catgut soaked in carbolised oil, and has reported favoinably of its employment. Experience has fully jrroved the value of this material in the arnest of hasmornhage, and a case has been reported by Holmes which shows that by its use it is possible completely to occlude a vessel of the size of the subclaviarr without division of its external coat. But very few cases of accident following its use have been reported. Irr one the ligatm’e, which had been applied to the carotid artery, softened and yielded soon after its application ; and in the other ulceration occurred in the coats of the femoral artery at the seat of hgatm’e, and fatal secondary hremorThage took place. In the first case, there is reason to beheve the ligature was not properly prepared; and in the second, the accident would probably have happened in the same way if a hemp or silk hgatm’e had been used. The ligatm'e is far more likely to soften when immersed in decomposing discharges than when buried in healthy granulations; but, even where no antiseptic dressing is adopted, it has been found to hold sufficiently long to ensure the obliteration of the vessel. At University College Hospital it has been used on arteries of all sizes om the femoral downwards, and in no case has any unpleasant consequence lesulted fiom its employment. If finther experience confirm these state- ments, we shall have reached as near perfection as possible in the airest of asmorrhage ; as the catgut ligature combines many of the advantages of ligature, acupressure, and torsion, and has none of their dangers or incon- veniences. The Reparation of the carbolised catgut is of the greatest importance. If feoa ed in pure carbolised oil, it becomes soft and slippery ; it is difficult to tie directions for its preparation are as follows ust be suspended for some weeks in an emulsion of water, carbolic acid=94 ARREST OF ARTERIAL H.EMORRIIAGE. :md oil, in whiob, after growing soft and oioaqne during the first fcAV days, it gradually experiences an opposite change, and at length becomes again quite transpai’ent, and is then little affected by water, and holds better when tied than waxed silk. The emulsion is best made by mixing one part of crystallised carbolic acid, deliquesced by means of water, with five parts of olive-oil. The Aery fine emulsion that results is placed in a covered jar, having a partition of glass or other material supported by pebbles at a short distance above the bottom, to afford space for the water that slowly subsides to accumulate in and keep it fi-om coming into contact with the hanks of gut which are placed loosely in the upper part of the vessel. The process of preparation goes on best in a cool place, and should be continued for two months at least ; and the gut goes on improving for an unlimited time if retained in the same oil.” Other modifications of the method of applying the Ligature have been devised by Siu’geons, in order to prevent the dangerous and troublesome consequences arising from the suppimation occasioned by it. Some, instead of briiiging the ends out of the womid, after haAung tied the various ai’teries in the usual way, cut off one end of each ligature, and then di’aw the remaining one out thi-ough a separate punctm’e in the skin. Other Sm’geons, again, have contented them- selves with simply passing the ligature roimd the artery, raising the vessel in the loop of the thread, Avhich is not tied, and bringing both ends out through a puncture made in the skin, where they are firmly fixed, so that the vessel is compressed by the loop, not tied in it. The ligatime is then withdraAvn, at the expiration of two or three days. These methods appear to me to have little to recommend them. The fu’st complicates rather than simplifies the operation ; and, at each ligatimed point, a tendency to ulceration might easily be established. The second method has the disadvantage of being unsafe. If the loop be drawn up tightly, it will cut through the vessel as if it had been tied. If it be left slack, there will certainly be a tendency to secondary hEemorrhage. Effects of Ligature.—The immediate effects on an artery of the applica- tion of a silk or thread ligature with a proper degree of force, are the division of the internal and middle coats of the A'essel, and the constriction of its outer one. If we examine the hgatmed vessel a few days after it has been tied, we find that the coats are contracted ; that there is an internal pyramidal coagulum, composed of plastic matter at its base, and fibrinous clot towards its apex (Fig. 118) ; and that the hgatmed portion of the vessel is sinrounded by a quantity of lymph. If the artery be examined at a stiU later period than this—at the end of two or three months, for instance—it AviU be found to be converted into a fibro-ccUular cord as high as the fii’st collateral branch above the ligatme (Fig. 128). Now these appearances are analogous to those met with in an ai’tery that has been ent across and occluded without the appheation of a ligature ; and are evidently the result of so-called adhesive inflammation of the vessel. The question arises, how this inflammation is set up when a ligatme is applied. Is it by the pressme of the noose, or by the division of the coats of the artery ? That it is not the mere pressure of the ligature that excites the occluding inflammation, is CAddentfiom the experiments of Jones and of Travers, Avho found that, if the ligatinj were removed shortly after its application, sufficient inflammatory action had been excited in the coats of the artery to lead to its complete occ usion. ncFORMATION OF INTERNAL COAGULUM. 295 tliougli iuiy inflammation set up in the external coat may cause an cttusion of lymph inside the vessel, yet that which is required to repair the breach occasioned by the di^■ision of the internal and middle coats, is the prin- cipal source of the plastic deposit. The changes that take place in the \ essel after the application of a ligatime require, however, to bo more carefully studied. The Formation of the Internal Coagulnm in the proxhnal end is the most important part of the process. For the fii-st four-and-tAventy hoiu’S after the apphcation of the ligatui'e there is little, if any, ap- pearance of this. Usually about this time, if opportunity offer to examine an artery in the human subject, it AAdll be foimd that a small nodule of lymph, of a yellowish or bufif colour, has been deposited in the bottom of the cul-de-sac that is formed by the retraction and contraction of the cut ends of the inner and middle coats, so as to close up the extremity of the artery. About the second or third day, this coagulum will be fomid to have assumed a conical shape (Fig. 118), the base being made up of de- colorised fibrine and exudation-matter, firmly adherent rig. iis.-Femoiai Ar- .

About the tenth day, the end of the vessel Avill be found to be tightly and firmly contracted upon the enclosed plug (Fig. 119), the dark-coloiued portions of Avhich now begin to midergo a process of absorption. Between this period and the sixth week, the contraction of the vessel and the absorption of the free part of the plug go on simultaneously ; the shrunken clot becoming permeated Avith neAV blood-A’essels, which communi- cate Avith the vasa vasoriim, while the interior of the artery becomes darkly stained by imbibition of the colouring mat- ter of the coagulum.

In some cases (Fig. 121), there is an imperfect formation of the internal plug, or CA'en total absence of it, and not unfi-equently secondary liEcmorrhage occurs as a consequence. This condition may arise either from want of plasticity in the blood, from an absence of due adhesive action, or from the coats not haAung been properly cut through. In other cases, in consequence of suppurative action being set up in the artery, a kind of disintegration or liquefaction of the plug takes place after it has been formed. This I have seenARREST OF ARTERIAL HjEMORRHAGE. 296 Fig. 121.—Partial Absorption of Coagiiliun in Femoral, four- teen days after Amputation.

Death from Pysemia. happen in a case of ligatiu’e of the carotid artery, in which death occiuTed from ■visceral disease ten weeks after the ope- ration ; and in the femoral, in cases of pyaemia (Fig. 122). In the distal cul- de-sac of the ligatm’cd artery I have never seen any very distinct coagulmn formed, either in the human subject or in dogs on which I have experimented, but merely small detached fragments of coagiila and some plastic material. The changes that take place in the External Coat are most important. After the internal and middle coats have been cut through by the ligature, the external coat would not be able to resist the impulse of the blood, ivere it not strengthened and consohdated by the adhesive process. The necessary stimulation is occasioned partly by the dissection required to expose the ves- sel, and partly by the pressiu’e and irri- tation of the hgatm’e. Lymph is thrown out between the vessel and its sheath, mattmg together these parts, and often enveloping the noose and knot in an ovoid mass. Progressively with the effusion of lymph and consequent strength- ening of the coats, the pressure of the noose causes gradual sloughing and ulceration of the part included within it. The mode in which the noose ulcerates through the external coat is of much importance, as on this depends m a great measiu’e the success of the ligatiu’e. There are two sources of danger in connection with this process ; either the sloughing may be too extensive, or the ulceration through the artery may take place before the adhesive jDlug is properly and ftrmly foimed. The chance of the sloughing being too extensive, principally arises from the ai’tery being- isolated and separated from its sheath to too gi-eat an extent dm-ing the dis- section required to expose it, and its nutrient vessels being consequently divided in great numbers, so as to deprive that portion of the coats of the vessel of its vascular supply; hence the danger of passing a spatula, large probe, or the handle of a scalpel under the artery, and also of applying several ligatm-es. Prematiu’e ulceration of the vessel may occm-, either from the patient’s constitution being too debilitated to allow healthy reparatne action, or from excessn^e degeneration of the artery at the point ligatmed. So soon as the ligature has ulcerated through that portion of the ai-tery which is included in its noose, it becomes loosened and separates ; freqxiently being thi’owm off 'with the discharges, or becoming detached on the slightest traction. The period of the separation of the ligatm-e depends upon the size of the artery and the thickness of its coats. From the radial 01 ulnar aiteiies, it is usually detached by the eighth day ; fr’om the femoral, iliac, 01 su c a^an, about the sixteenth or twentieth day. In some cases the ligatme wi con mucAGUPRESSUliE. 297 attached for a much longer period than this, owing to the inclusion within its noose of a bit of lascia, nor^■e, or muscular substance. In order to hasten the separation in these cases, moderate traction and occasional t-wisting of the ligatiu-e may be practised. 8. Acupressure.—By Acupressure is meant the occlusion of an arteiy by the pressure of a needle in such a way as to an*est the circidation through it or the ha3morrhage from it. This method of treatment was introduced into siu'gical practice by the late Sir James Simpson as a substitute for the ligature. Acupressme may be applied in several different ways. There are four principal methods. The first method is can-ied out in the following way, which I give as nearly as possible in Sir James Simpson’s own words. The Surgeon places the tip of the fore-finger of his left hand upon the bleeding mouth of the arteiy which he intends to compress and close ; holding the needle in his right hand, he passes it thi-ough the cutaneous siu-face of the flap, and pushes it inwards till its point jirojects out to the extent of a few lines on the raw surface of the woimd, a little to the right of, and anterior to, his finger-tip ; he then, by the action of his right hand upon the head of the needle, turns and directs its sharp extremity so that it makes a bridge as it were across the site of the tube of the bleeding artery, immediately in front of the j)oint of the finger Avith which he is shutting up its orifice ; he next, either vsdth the same fore-finger of the left hand, or Avith the side of the extremity of the needle itself, compresses the locality of the bleeding arterial orifice and tube, and then pushes on the needle Avith his right hand, so as to make it re-enter the siu'face of the AA-ound a httle to the left side of the artery ; and, lastly, by pressing the needle farther on in this direction, its point re-emerges thi’ough the cutaneous sirnface of the flfip the site of the tube of the bleeding artery being in this way left pinned Fig. 123.—Acupressure. First Method. Fig. —^.iVeupressure. First Method. Raw Surface. Cutaneous Surface. doAVTi in a compressed state by the arc or bridge of steel that is passed over it. d ha needle thus passes first thi’ough and fr’om the skin of the flap inwards to the raw siuface of the Avound, and, after bridging OA’er the site of the artery, it passes secondly from the raw surface of the Avouud outwards again to and through the skin. Sometimes the needle Avill be best passed by the aid of the eye alone, and Avithout guiding its coiu’se by the finger-tip applied to the bleeding orifice. It compresses not the arterial tube alone, but also the struc- tures placed over and around the site of the tube. When the needle is com- p etcly adjusted, all of it that is seen, and that not necessarily so, on the siu’face 0 the raw wound, is the small portion of it passing over the site of the artery ( ig. 123); while externally, upon the cutaneous surfiico of the flap, Ave have298 ARREST OF ARTERIAL HjEMORRIIAGE. remaining exposed more or less of its two extremities, namely, its point and its head (Fig. 124). The rest of it is hidden in the strnctmns of the flap or side of the wound. The degree of pressure required to close effectually the tube of an artery is certainly much less than Surgeons generally imagine ; but in the above proceeding the amount of pressure can be regulated and increased ■when required, by the acuteness of the angle at which the needle is intro- duced and again passed out—the cutaneous and other stractiu’es of the flap seizing as the resisting medium against which the needle compresses the arterial tube. The second method of acupressime consists in taking a short sewing needle Avith a piece of tudsted iron wire attached, for the purpose of withdrawing it when necessary. This is dipped down into the soft tissues on one side of the artery ; then bridged over the vessel; then dipped doAvn again into the soft Fig. 125.—Acupressiu-e. Second Method. structimes on the other side of the vessel (Fig. 125). In doing this, care must be taken to press the end of the needle down upon the bleeding tiunk 01 tube of the artery Avith sufficient force. The third method is the one that is likely to be most frequently followed, and is upon the Avholc the most practical and the best. It consists in compressing the artery between the needle threaded with a piece of twisted iron AAire, passed below or behind it, and a loop of inelastic iron wire passed over or above it. The needle is passed as in the last cases, but on the opposite side of t e artery. The loop of iron Avire is throAvn over the point of the needle ; it is then passed across the artery, draAvn tight so as to compress the vesse , an seem-ed by a half tAvist round the eye end of the needle (Fig. 12G). In order to remove this appai’atus, all the Surgeon has to do is to pull the twisted Avu-e with which the needle is tkreaded ; tliis, in AA-ithdraAiing the needle, hberates the loop, which may then easily be removed. _ fourth method consists in dipping the needle into the tissues close to artery, then makmg a timi Auth the point, and pushing this into the soft part beyond, so as to fix it there, and thus to compress the ai'tery (Fig. 127). The Condition of the Artery after liaA'ing been subjected to acupressiue has still to be determined. Docs Fig. 127.—Aciipiessure. Fomtii Metiiod. pressiu’c of the iicedlc dividc, as the ligatm-c does, tho internal and middle coats ? or docs it merely canse themACUPJiESSURE AND LIGATURE COURARED. 299 to adhere by direct compression ? In all probability the latter result is the only one obtained ; a coagulum forming by the stasis of the blood between the point compressed and the nearest collateral branch. This point is one of importance ; for there can be little doubt that one of the safeguards after the ligature is this division of the inner coats of the artery, the consequence of which is the effusion of a plastic plug Muthiu the vessel, by which it is more effectually sealed than it can be by mere cohesion of its sides and the formation of a blood- coagulum. The time during wdiich the needle should bo left in will vary with the size of the artery. As a general rule, it should bo from thirty to sixty hour’s according to the size of the vessel. The needle must not be left in too long, lest iiTitation be set up, and ulceration induced along its track. Acupressure and Iiigature compared.—That arterial harmoiThage may be effectually controlled by acupressure in many cases, is undoubted. This fact has long been familiar to Siu’geons in the oj)eration for hare-lip, in which the bleeding from the coronary artery is restrained by the pin that is passed across to imitc the opposite sides of the cleft, and it has of late years been abinidantly proved in the case of the largest arteries di'vided in amputations. But, though by means of acupressure arterial htemorrhage may undoubtedly be controlled, the real question which has still to be answered is, whether we are justified in substituting this means for the ligature in surgical practice. When we reflect on the ease and certainty with which the most furious haemor- rhage from the largest artery can be at once and permanently arrested, by the tying of the mouth of the bleeding vessel with a silken thread—the inestimable advantage which the hgatm’e has been and is to Surgeons, in enabling them to cany the knife with safety into regions where its presence Would otherwise be fatal—we should not lightly, and on insufficient evidence, throw aside a means of such tried utility for one that is of more doubtful value. And few practical Surgeons null probably discard the thi-ead for the needle in the arrest of arterial luemoiThage, unless the latter can be proved to be more certain and more safe than the former. Sir James Simpson, who pressed the subject of acupressin’e upon the atten- tion of Surgeons with an amount of zeal, of learning, and experimental research, which is indeed to be admired, advanced a ■\nriety of arguments in favbiu* of aiTesting arterial htemorrhage by the needle rather than by the ligature. These may briefly be summed up as follows. The gi’eat object of every Surgeon is to heal operation-wounds by the first intention. A V serious and fatal obstacle to this method of healing is the use of the ligature. The ligature acts injuriously in two ways : 1, each thread acts as a seton and sets up a^ line of suppuration along its track ; 2, the cut end of the artery included in and projecting beyond its noose forms a slough which increases e si;ppnrative action, both by undergoing a process of disintegration and by noting as a foreign body in the Avound. Complete healing of a Avound to Avhich n igatiu-e has been applied cannot, therefore, possibly take place until after the sepal ation of the ligature and the section of the included arterial tube. lese evils are entirely ol)viated, and union by the first intention is secured.AltliEST OF AUTEUIAL HjEUOUUIIAGE. 300 1, by the use ot metallic compressors, the needle and wire being tolerated by the tissues amongst which they lie, and not acting as setons in the way that liempen or silken ligatm'es do ; and 2, by the early withdrawal of these com- pressing agents, the vitality of the artery not being endangered and no terminal slough resulting. That these arguments are sound, it is impossible to deny. Tlae principle on which acupressiu’e is founded is in accordance with the fundamental doctrines of surgical pathology, and must commend itself to every practical Surgeon Avho dispassionately considers this important question. But, whilst I admit to the fullest the truth and pathological somidness of the principle on which acupressiu’e is founded, and whilst I cannot but regard any method of treatment which faeditates the early healing of operation- Avoimds, Avithout suppurative action, as a gi’eat step in advance of sm’gical practice, I cannot but think that, in estimating the comparative value of the Ligatiu’e and of Acupressm’e in the arrest of sm’gical htemoiThage, too much ‘ CAul has been laid to the charge of the thread, and too much advantage has been claimed for the needle. If the Hgature Avere the sole or indeed the great cause of suppimation in wounds, and of the failure of union by the first intention, it should im- doubtedly be discarded in favoiu’ of any safe method that would obAiate these evils. But is the ligatm’e in reality so injurious ? Are there not many causes of want of union by the first intention which are entirely independent of the method adopted for occluding the arteries ? The constitutional condition of the patient, irrespective of anything in the local management of the AA’ound (p. 5), as well as the want of homogeneity of tissue (p. 173), and the very nature of the wound itself, have a most decided infiuence. In many wounds— as in operations for the removal of dead bone, the excision of bones and joints, the ablation of many tiunoms, &c.,—no attempt at union by the first intention is made ; the wound is stuifed perhaps Avith lint, or the tissues are in such a condition that suppuration is a necessity for healing. So, again, in amputations (p. 4G), there are many circumstances that militate against complete primary union, and ahvays must do so. Amongst these may be mentioned the impossibihty of close approximation of the flaps, OAving to the intravention of the bone ; or, in some amputations, as the partial ones of the foot, the very shape of the flap, and the irregularity of the osseous sm-faces; the inability of cohesion between ahen tissues, as bone or synovial membrane and muscle, &c. In some cases, midoubtedly, where many or deep ligatmes have to be applied, the threads add to the difficulty in effecting direct union. But in many amputations it must be remembered that the chief and perhaps the only ligatm-es are applied to vessels that, being cut long, are on a level Avith the edge of the flap. This is the case in amputation of the forearm, and at the shoulder, hip, and knee, in amputations of the leg low doAAm, and m all ampu- tations done by the long flap. In such cases, acupressiu’e Avould do little to aid in accomplishing direct union. Although, thei’efore, I do not consider that the ligature is in piactice opeu to the objection which has been laid to its charge, that it is the chief obstacle to the union of Avounds by the first intention, yet undoubtedly it is m many instances a hindrance to this desirable result; and, when so, it ceitainly appeal’sCOLLATERAL CIRCULATION. 301 desirable that acupressure should be substituted for it. lu many instances also, and in some even whore union by the first intention is not possible, acupres- kire is a most convenient and safe method of arresting bleeding from vessels which it may be very difficult to expose and tie. Thus, in lacerated or incised wounds of the scalp, in injuries of the hand or foot, the bleeding may often be at once controlled by the pressure of the needle and -\vire. Indeed, it appears to me, that sound as may be the principle on which acu- pressure is based, in practice it cannot and need not be substituted for the ligature, but that it may be employed advantageously in conjunction with fr, each method being applied to those vessels or in those cases to which and in which it seems most useful ; and that the Smgeon -will act more wisely in being eclectic rather than dogmatic in the employment of his means for arrest- ing arterial hromoiThage, in some cases using styptics, in others compression or torsion or the carrtery, acupressru’e or the ligature, as the particular case seems to rreed it. Because one method is good, the others are not necessarily bad ; because one is peculiarly applicable in one case, it does not foUow that it is equally so in all. ' Collateral Circulation.—When the main artery of a limb has been liga- tured, or in any other way occluded, it is only the direct flow of blood that is inteiTupted ; the indirect supply which is conveyed into the limb or part, by the frne communication between the anastomosing vessels of the different por- tions of the arterial system, being sufficient to preserve its vitality, and to prevent the occru-rence of gangrene. So free and ready are the inosculations kept up between different portions of the arterial system, that, after the largest arteries in the body, such as the subclavian, ihac, and aorta, have been ligatured, sufficient blood to support life is at once conveyed into the distal parts supplied by them. This collateral circulation is most active and most readily main- tained in early fife, when the vessels are pliant and elastic, readily accommo- dating themselves to the increased quantity of blood that they are required to convey. As age advances, the vascular system becomes less elastic, and there is a greater difficulty in the establishment and maintenance of the collateral circulation. The anastomosing vessels which serve this piu-pose are invariably furnished by arteries contiguous to that which is ligatured, and come off from the same side of the body. Thus, for instance, after the ligature of the super- ficial femoral, it is by the profunda artery that the supply of blood is carried to the lower extremity. Thus also, when the common carotid is ligatured, the circulation to the parts it supplies is not maintained through the medium of the opposite carotid, although the inosculations between the ultimate branches of the two v^essels are so free upon the throat, and the face, and within the cranium ; but it is by means of the inferior thyroid and vertebral arteries, (branches of the subclavian on the same side), which become greatly enlarged, that the supply of blood is kept up to the parts on the outside, as well as in the inside of the cranium. The supply of blood that is sent to a limb, after the deligation of the main trunk, is at first but small in quantity ; being merely sufficient for the mainte- nance of its vitality, but not enough for the continuance of the usual ftmetion of the part. Hence, although the life of a limb may be preserved after the ligature of its artery, it becomes cold, and the patient is unable to move it for302 ARREST OF ARTERIAL lUEMORRlIAGE. some time, the muscles uppeiiring to bo completely paralysed ; gi-adually, how- ever, the supply of blood iucreases, until, when it has reached its usual standard, the normal vigoiu* of the part returns. By Avhat mechanism is this re-estahlishment of the blood-supply accom- plished? It is due to three series of changes taking place: l,in the Capillaries; 2, in the Anastomosing Branches; and 3, in the Trunk itself. The Capillaries are the first to enlarge; and this they appear to do by a vital process, and not in consequence of the mere increased pressm’e of the blood ; the temperatm-e of the lunb often rising, in the course of a day or two, to its normal standard, and sometimes to two or three degrees beyond it, whilst a great sensation of heat is experienced in it by the patient. This period extends over several weeks ; and, if opportimity be afforded of examining the limb diu-ing its continuance, the tissues generally will he found to be preter- naturally vascular, admitting injection freely. Coincidently with this increase of activity in the capillary system, the Anastomosing Arteries of the part enlarge, becomuig serpentine, tortuous, and waved, forming circles or an interlaced net-work. During this eularge- Fig. 128.—Anastomosing Cir- culation in Sartorius and Pectinens of Dog, three months after Ligature of Femoral. (After Poita.) Fig. 129.—Direct Anasto- mosing Vessels of Eight Carotid of Goat, five months after Ligature. (After Porta.) Fig. 130.—Change in the Trunk after Ligature, ■with Anasto- mosing Vessel. ment, much pain is often experienced, oiving to the pressure of the enlarged vessels upon neighbom’ing nerves. This foim of collateral circidation com- mences by a general enlargement of aU those muscular and subcutaneous secondary vessels of the limb, which can normally be readily distinguished by the naked eye. After this general enlargement has continued for some weeks, it tends to localise itself in a few of the principal anatomical inosculations, until at last it is through their medium that the circulation is chiefly maintained. Thus for instance, after the ligature of the common carotid, the supply of blood is ultimately conveyed by the inosculations between the superior and3°3 SECOND A li Y H.EMOmUIA GE. inferior th^Toiil arteries, and by tlae vertebral and basikir. When the sub- clavian is tied, the circulation of the upper extremity is can-ied on by the anastomoses between the posterior scapular and suprascapular, and the branches of the axillary artery distributed to the vicinity of the shoulder, and between the intercostals and the long and superior thoracic ; and when the external iliac is tied, the blood is conveyed to the lower limb by the inosculations between the manmiary and lumbar arteries and the epigastric and circumflex ilii, and by those between the obturator, gluteal, and sciatic arteries and the ciremnflex branches of the profunda femoris. Jones pointed out the curious circumstance that, when two anastomosing branches approach one another, they split, before inosculating, into two or three ramuscidi, which by uniting form a circle of anastomoses. Besides this kind of collateral circidation, Mamioir, Porta, and Stifling have noticed vessels rimning directly between the extremities of the obliterated trunk, foi-ming species of ai-terial shoots, springing from the stump of the vessel (Fig. 129). The Change that takes place in the Trunk consists in its conversion into a fibro-ceflidar cord, from the point to which the ligature has been applied to the fii’st large collateral branch below it (Figs. 128 to 130) ; here it becomes pernous again, and, recei-viug the blood poured into it through the different anastomosing chamiels, becomes again subservient to the purposes of circulatioii. Porta and Stifling have shovm that, after a time, down the centre of this fibro- ceflular cord a small tortuous central canal becomes developed, uniting the two distant ends of the dmded artery. This is probably the last change that takes place in the establishment of the collateral circulation. The collateral circulation is occasionally not sufficiently fr-ee to preseiwe the integi-ity or vitality of the parts supplied by it. As a consequence of this, gangrene not uncommoidy results, or the limb may become paralysed or atrophied. This condition is frequently met with in old people, fr-om ossifica- tion and rigidity of the arterial system ; or it may happen as the result of copious hEemorrhage, or of an extensive transverse wound of the limb diwding many of the anastomoshig vessels. It more rarely happens that we find too great fr’eedom of the anastomoses, so as to lead to a faihue of the j)ui’poses for which the ligatm’e has been applied, by the rapid admission of blood into the distal side of the vessel, thus perhaps occasioning secondary hcemorrhage. ACCIDENTS AFTER ARTERIAL OCCLUSION BY SURGICAL MEANS. The accidents that may follow the application of the ligature, the use of acupressm’e, or of compression in any way exercised upon woimded arteries, are SecQndaiy Htemorrhage and Gangi-ene of the Limb. Secoxdaey or Recurrent H.a3MORRHAGE.—By this is meant, bleeding from any cause after the employment of the means above mentioned. This accident may arise hum a variety of circumstances, Avhich may be divided into two great classes :—1. Local Causes, dependent on the Vessel or Ligature ; and 2. Conshlutional Causes, connected Avith some Morbid Condition of the Constitution or of the Blood, in consequence of which those changes Avhich arc necessaiy for occlusion of the artery do not take place. Local Causes.—^ong this class of causes may be mentioned any imper- Jec ion m the apiiUcalwn of the licjalure, needle, or comimss; as, for instance, theARREST OF ARTERIAL IIJEMORRIIAGE. 3°4 ligature being tied too loosely, or witli the inclusion of a portion of nerve, vein, or muscle ; so also the accidental puncture of the artery above the point to Avhich the ligatui’e is applied, Ihe rush 0/ Ijlood through a neiglibouring trunh or collateral branch imme- diately above the ligature has been considered as likely to interfere Avith the formation of the internal plug ; but too much importance should not be attached to this, for Porter has tied the carotid successftiUy within one-eighth of an inch of the brachio-cephalic artery; Bellingham has ligatm-ed the external iliac close to its origin; and Aston Key, the subclavian in the vicinity of a large branch, ndthout secondaryhsemoiThage ensuing. Butalthough the ligatme maybe safely applied near’ a branch on its proximal side, I think that the preseirce of a colla- teral branch in close proximity to the distal side of the ligature—more especially if it be one that serves to carry on the anastomosing circulation—Avill be found to haA^e a decided tendency to prevent the occlusion of the distal end of the artery, and thus to favour the occun-ence of secondary haemorrhage. The tvound of a collateral branch immediately above the hgatiu'e, though it does not perhaps give rise to troublesome hEemorrhage at the time, will, as I have seen, cause fmious bleeding as the collateral circulation becomes established. Irritability of the arterial system is very apt to dispose to the occiuTence of secondary hEemorrhage. There is a peculiar condition of the arterial system indicated by the ordinary evidences of a sanguine temperament—^by a fall- ] sized and forcible pulsation of the arteries, in which, when the vessel is exposed, I it appears hard, thick-walled, and muscular, beats forcibly and almost uncon- ; troUably, in which secondary hEemorrhage is very apt to occur. In these cases ! the propulsive power of the heart would seem to overcome all those obstacles in ) the way of internal clot, plastic deposit, and contraction of the vessel on which the occlusion of its cahbre depends ; and on the separation of the ligatm’e recurrent hEemon-hage mil take place in the most vehement and uncontrollable maimer. A diseased state of ihe coats of the artery at the point deligated or compressed wiU occasion rapid sloughing and unhealthy ulceration of the vessel; those plastic changes which are necessary for its occlusion not going on within it. It has happened that fatal secondary hEemorrhage has ocemred from a large artery, such as the femoral, in consequence of a small atheromatous or calcareous patch having gnnn way inmiediately aboAn the hgature, a day or two after its application, _ • i? i ^ Constitutional Causes.—These act by preventing the formation of a clot within, and the deposit of plastic matter Avithout, the artery; or by causing their absorption in a few days, if they have been formed. (Figs. 121 and 122.) Amongst the most common of these causes are those unhealthy states of the system in which diffused erysipelatous inflammation sets in, Avhich is incom- patible Avith plastic effiision. In these cases either no internal coagulum at all is formed, or it is weak, imperfect, and unable to resist the impulse oi the blood ; speedily becoming absorbed or disintegrated, and washed away.^ There EU-c also certain states of the blood in which from disease, as albiuuniuria, it has lost its plasticity, and cannot yield the products of adhesion Secondary hEemorrhage is specially apt to occiu in cases of pyccima, proAided that disease3°5 SEC ON DA R Y HjEMORREA GE. assume a somo^'liafc clironic character. The condition of the blood in pymmia beino- incompatible with the formation of a firm and plastic coagulum mthin the artery, the vessel continues or becomes open, and secondary hmmorrhage will certainly occur. In some cases the secondary hemorrhage appears to be due to an excited state of the circulation. The patient is restless, and has a quick, irritable, and jerking pulse. In such circumstances, bleeding is very apt to occur, and, if not too abimdant, appears to give relief to the system. The occurrence of erysipelas, phlelitis, or sloughing of the stump or tuound, will prevent or arrest the necessary adhesive action. The sloughing action set up in a woimd may extend to the larger arteries, and by destroying their coats occasion secondary hmmoiThage. But it must be borne in mind that the arterial tissues are usually the last of the soft tissues to slough. An artery will continue to pulsate in a wound, and preserve its integrity while all the adjacent tissues are sloughy and disorganised. Phenomena.—The occiu’rence of secondary htemori’hage is usually some- what gradual, and not without warning. The blood does not burst forth in a sudden gush, but appears at first in a small quantity, oozing out of the wound and staining the dressings ; it may then cease to flow for a time, but breaks out again in the course of a few hours, welhug up freely in the wound, and either exhausting the patient by repeated losses, attended by the phenomena that characterise haemoirhagic fever, or else debihtating him so that he falls a ■victim to some asthenic disease, such as pneumonia, erysipelas, or phlebitis. In other cases again, after a few warnings, the blood may biu'st out in a gush- ing stream that at once destroys hfe. The opportunities which I have had of examining the state of the vessels in several cases of fatal secondary hemorrhage, lead me fully to concur 'with Guthrie and Porter, that the blood in the great majority of instances comes Irom the distal and not fi’om the proximal side of the wound. The greater tendency in the distal end of the vessel to bleed, appears to arise partly from the less perfect occlusion of this portion of the artery, and partly from its greater hability to slough, in consequence of the hgatm’e interrupting its supply of blood through the vasa vasormn. It is no objection to this opinion that the fatal heemorrhage is often arterial; for, though it is true that the blood which is carried to the distal end is, for the first few days after the ap- plication of a hgatiu’e, of a venous hue, yet, after the collateral circulation is once finely established, it gTadually assumes a more scarlet tint, and at last becomes completely arterialised. Periods at whicli it occurs.—Secondary hemorrhage may come on at any time between the application of the hgature and the closure of the woimd. There are, however, three periods at which it is particularly apt to occm*:— 1, a few hours after the ligatm’e has been aj)phed ; 2, about the period of the separation of the ligature ; and, 3, at an indefinite time after its separation. 1. The htemoiThage which occurs a few hours after the application of the ligature, commonly called reactionary or intermediate, comes on as the patient recovers fr-om the depressing influence of the chloroform or fi'om the shock of the operation, and arises from some imperfection in the tying of the jgatme. That which ocems some days afterwards arises from diseai in the VOL, I, XARREST OF ARTERIAL HjEMORRIIAGE. 3o6 arterial coats, causing them to give way ; from sloughing ; or from want of proper adhesive action on the face of a stump. When it arises ft’om the latter cause, there is a general oozing or dribbling of blood from many points of the surface, rather than a gush from one orifice. In those cases in which the artery has been tied above the. wound only, haemorrhage is very apt to occur at tliis early period. 2. When haemon’hage occiu’s about the time of the scparatmi of the ligature, it may arise fi'om any of the causes already specified that interfere with the due formation of an internal coagulum, or that occasion ulceration and sloughing of the coats of the vessel. The occun’ence of haemorrhage at this time is often connected with, or dependent upon, that peculiar irritability of the heart and arteries which has already been mentioned as a fr'equent cause of bleeding. 3. Lastly, in some cases in which the ligature has separated but the u'ound has remained open, the haemorrhage may take place either ft’om the cicatrix in the artery being too weak to support the impulse of the blood ; or ft’om the coagulum being absorbed in the way afready mentioned. The continuance of the open state of the wound after the separation of the ligatiu-e, is, I think, not improbably dependent upon a morbid condition of the coats of the vessel which eventually leads to hcEmorrhage. The length of tune that sometunes elapses between the separation of the hgatiue and the occurrence of htemoiThage is very remarkable ; thus there is in St. Thomas’s Hospital a preparation of a carotid artery, fr-om which secondary hgemonhage took place in the tenth week after ligatm'C ; and South mentions a case of ligature of the subclavian in which the thread separated on the twenty-seventh day, the fatal lipmonhage occm’ring in the thirteenth week. The Treatment of Secondary Haemorrhage must be considered, as the bleeding takes place, 1, from a Stmnp; and, 2, from an Ai’teiy tied in its Continuity. In all cases of ligature of arteries, care should of course be taken to prevent, if possible, this accident, by keeping the patient perfectly quiet, givuig no stimulants, having the bowels kept open and the secretions free, and avoiding any undue traction on the hgatiue itself. In primary haemorrhage the rule of practice is, not to uiterfere by operation if once the bleeding have been arrested by other means. In secondary hiemoi- rhao-e this rule does not apply ; but the Siugeon may proceed to adopt effectual means for the prevention of the recurrence of the bleeding after the first out- fUmno-Ti nil flow of blood havc censed when he sees the patient;TREATMENT OF SECONDARY IIJEMORRUAGE. 307 for delay, no time for consultation, none for reference to books; but tbc Siu’geon must act at once on his o^vn responsibility. 1. When the circulation is in-itable and excited, the pulsation free in a stump, and when the main vessels can be seen several days after the operation beating forcibly at the further ends, the ligatures being jerked up and domi, there is great danger of secondary hmmoiThagc occurring, and the patient must be closely watclicd ; the artery should be digitally compressed, and the diet lowered. In these cases it may sometimes be advisable to have recoiu’se to venesection. The treatment of secondary haemorrhage from a Stump will depend in a great measure on the degi'ec of union that has taken place between the flaps, and on the situation of the stump. When the hmmoiThage ocems a few days after amputation, if there be but slight oozing, eleA'ating the part, a])plying cold, and bandaging it tightly noth a roller, so as to compress the flaps. Anil sometimes arrest the bleeding. If it continue, however, or become more severe, the flaps, Avhich Avill have been dis- united by the effusion of blood, must be separated, and the bleeding vessels sought for and tied. When the stump is sloughy, and the tissues softened, the ligatm-es vrill not hold ; in these circumstances the application of the actual cauteiy to the bleeding points AviU aivest the flow of blood. If the oozing ap- pear to be nearly general from the number of points, the flaps being someAA'hat spongy, I have succeeded in aivesting the hmmoiThage by clearing their siufaces thoroughly of all coagula, and then bringing them tightly together by means of a roller. If the hmmoiThage occim at a later period, after the tenth day, Avhen tolerable union has taken place, and if it appear to proceed fr’om the principal artery of the part, an efibrt may be made to arrest it by the application of the horse-shoe tourniquet, which occasionaUy will stop aU frmther loss of blood ; or, if the union that had taken place between the flaps have been broken through, the stump may be fairly opened up, the coagula timied out, and the bleeding vessel sought for and tied. If however, notAvithstanding the haemor- ihage, the imion between the flaps continue sound and firm, then the choice lies between tlnee alternatives; 1, opening up the stump, clearing away coagula, and tying the bleeding vessels at their open mouths ; 2, h'gaturing the main aiteiy just a,boAn the stump; 3, performing the Hunterian operation, and tying the A essel high up in the limb at a distance from the stump. The course to be adopted Avill, I think, in a great measure depend upon the stump Avith w 1C 1 we have to do ; but as a general rule I prefer in these cases adopting e 1st alternatiA'e, placing a tourniquet on the limb, passing the finger into e ^ump, and breaking up all adhesions, which are often very film ; then uniing out the mass of eoagiila, which aaIU usually be found distending the aps, c earing these thoroughly AA'ith a sponge, and then tying the bleeding ai eiy. f there be a difficulty in exposing this, or in clearing it so that the iga lire Avill hold, acupressure may be advantageously substituted for the liga- Airc, anc the effects of this may be increased by the continnons employment of groin. Besides the main artery that bleeds—one of e 1 )ials, for instance, if it be a leg-amputation—there Avill generally be A-ery th?iw”° of this may be sto]iped by tho I,gat.,re passed, if the tissues be friable, by meaus of a Myus-uecdle umlor X 2ARREST OF ARTERIAL HJEMORRllAGE. 3o8 the vessels. The rest will cease on the application of cold water and on raisino- the stnmp. The flaps may then be brong’ht together by strips of plaster and a bandage, and will iisnally very readily miite. Should, however, the stimip be inflamed, sloughy, and oedematous, and more particularly if it be merely the foot or hand that has been removed, then, instead of opening it up, and seeking for the bleeding vessel, deeply hidden in infiltrated tissues, it will be better to tie the main artery of the limb just above the flaps, or wherever it can be most readily reached. In sueh cases, after amputation of the foot, I have successfully tied the posterior tibial low down, just above the malleolus. The third alternative, that of ligatiuing the artery high above the stump, should, I think, in the fii-st instance, be undertaken in those cases oifly where the amputation has been done close to the trimk, as at the shoulder-joint, or the middle or upper part of the thigh, and where consequently there is no length of hmb to be noiu’ished by the artery that is ligatimed, and where opening up an almost cicatrised stump of very large size would inflict a greater shock upon the system, and more subsequent danger, than the dehgation of an artery by an independent operation. Hence, although in no case of secondary haemorrhage from a leg-stump below the knee would I ligatiu’e the femoral in preference to opening up the flaps and seciu-ing the vessels in them, if this were practicable, yet in secondary haemorrhage after the amputation of the thigh, the case might be different; and here, if good union had aheady taken place, and the stump were not distended by coagula, the main artery might be tied. In such cases it is clearly useless to ligature the superficial femoral, as the hjemonhage may, and most probably does, proceed from some of the branches of the profunda. Ligature of the common femoral is not very successful; and upon the whole it would, I think, be safer, if all other means have been tried and have failed, to deligate the external iliac just above Poupart’s hgament. In disarticulation of the ana at the shoulder-joint, the subclavian artery must be tied, either above or just below the clavicle. In any case, the ligature of the main artery of the limb becomes the only and the last resotnee, where, in consequence of the softened, inflamed, infil- trated or sloughy state of the tissues, the Singeon is imable to secure the bleeding vessels in the stump itself, the hgatures cutting through the dis- organised coats of the vessels. 2. When the heemonhage occurs after a hgatine has been applied to the Continuity of the Vessel, whether for injiuy or disease, pressm-e must fii-st be tried. With this view the woimd should be plugged, and a graduated compress should be very firmly and carefully apphed by means of a ling-tom- niquet over the point from which the blood proceeds; in this way the bleeding may occasionally be stopped. Not nofr’equently, however, this_ udll prove ^ ineffectual, the bleeding reciuTing from underneath. HTen this is the case, what should the Surgeon do ? He may re-apply the compress once more uith gTcat care, after clearing away coagifla, and drying the parts thoroughly ; but should it again fail in arresting the bleeding, it is useless to trust to it again, as the haemonhage will certainly recur, and valuable time and much b oo u i be lost in these fr-uitless attempts at checking it. In such a case as this, the I Surgeon must clearly and decidedly determine on the course to be pm succ, as |TREATMENT OF SECONDARY IIjEMORRHAGE. 3°9 there is but “little time for reflection or consultation, and none for referring to authorities.” . ^ If the artery be situated on the trunk, as the subclavian, carotid, or one or the iliacs, there is nothing to be done but to trust to the plugging of the wound ; and in the great majority of these cases the patient will die exhausted by repeated hiemorrhage. "When the artery is situated in one of the limbs, more efficient procedmes may be employed. If it be one of the arteries of the upper extremity the wound should be opened up, and an attempt made to tie both ends of the vessel again in this ; should this fail, or not be practicable, the aitciy must be deligated at a higher point than that at which it had been previously tied; should the hiemorrhage continue, or be re-established, amputation is the only resoimce left. In the lower exti’emity, the treatment of secondary hjemorrhage occurring after ligatm’e is replete with difS-Culty. Here I beheve it to be useless to tie the ai'tery at a higher point than that to which the hgatime has been ah’eady applied, as gangrene is very apt to follow this double ligatm’e of the arteries of the lower extremity : at least, in the two or three cases that I have seen in which recoiu’se has been had to this practice, mortification of the hmb has ensued ; and in aU. the reported cases with which I am acquainted, a similar result has occurred. The treatment should vary according as we have the femoral ai’tery or one of the tibials to deal with. If the hemorrhage proceed from the femoral, I should be disposed to cut down on the bleeding part of the vessel, treating it aS a wounded artery, and applying a ligatm’e above and below the part already dehgated ; this operation would, however, necessarily be fraught with difficulty. Should this be impracticable, or not succeed in checking the hsemorrhage, we should best consult the safety of the patient by amputating at once on a level with or above the ligatm’e. Although this is an extreme measme, it is infinitely preferable to allowing him to nm the risk of the supeiwention of gangrene, which will require removal of the limb under less favourable conditions. If the secondary haemorrhage proceed from one of the tibials, it would be next to useless to adopt either of the preceding alternatives. If we hgatmed the superficial femoral, the bleeding would not be permanently controlled, or, if it were, gangrene of the limb would in all pro- bability set in. There are but very few cases on record in which this practice has been followed without mortification occurring. In a few rare instances, however, the hgature of the popliteal has, in such circumstances, succeeded : but it has also frequently failed, rendering secondary amputation necessary, and its^success is a mere matter of chance. The depth at which the tibials are situated is so great, that it would be hopeless to search for one of these vessels and attempt its dehgation at the bottom of a deep, sloughy, infiltrated and infiamed wound. In such circumstances, therefore, I think we should ampu- tate the leg above the seat of wound. This is truly a severe measure; but the only other alternative that has, to my knowledge, ever succeeded, is the ligature of the pophtcal; and as that, as has aheady been stated, has frequently failed, I think that, as a rule, we should best consult the safety of the patient by the removal of the limb at once. If the hsemorrhage occiu’ from a woimded artery to which ligatmes have310 ARREST OF ARTERIAL HuEMORRIIAGE. iilicady been applied above and below the seat of wound, the same treatment must be adopted as in those cases in which the bleeding takes place from the applieation of the ligature to the continuity of the vessel. Ganqreniii I'OLijOWiNGr LiGATURK.—After the ligature of the main artery of a limb, the collateral circulation is, under all ordinary circumstances, sufficient to maintain the vitality of the part supphed by the deligated vessel. In some cases, howc'S'cr, it happens that the condition of the circulation in the parts below the ligatm’e is not compatible with their life. Causes.—The causes influencing the occurrence of gangTene in this way are the Age of the Patient, the Seat of the Operation, and the various Conditions in which the Limb may afterwards be placed. The influence of age is not, however, so marked as might ct, loriori be supposed ; for, although there can be no doubt that there is a less accommo- dating power in the arterial system to varying quantities of blood at an advanced period of life, and that there would be gveater difliciflty in main- taining the vitahty of the hmb after hgatiu’e of the artery iir a man of sixty than in one of twenty-five ; yet I And that, of thirty cases in which gangrene of the lower extremity followed the ligature either of the external ihac or femoral arteries, the average age of the patient was thirty-five years, as nearly as possible the mean age at which these operations, according to Norris’s Tables, are generally performed. Of these cases of gangrene two occurred in persons under twenty years of age, eleven between Lventy and thirty, eight between thirty and forty, and nine above forty. The seat of the oj^eration influences greatly the liability tb gangrene, which is much more frequent after the ligature of the arteries in the lower than in the upper extremity. Besides these predisposing causes, gangrene after ligatm’e may be direetly occasioned by a deficient sup'plg of arterial Mood. In some cases this may arise from the collateral vessels being imable, in consequence of the rigidity of their coats, to accommodate themselves to the increased quantity of blbod Avhich they are required to transmit ; or they may be compressed in such a way by extraA’asation as to be materially lessened in their capacity. In other instances again, the existence of cardiac disease may interfere with the proper supply of blood to the part. Great loss of Mood, either in consequence of secondary hemorrhage, or in any other way, before or after the appheation of the hgatiu’c, is often foUoAved by gangTene, and is almost certain to be attended by this result if a second hgatiu’c haA’e been apphed to a higher point in the lower extremity. That a diminution in the quantity of blood circulating in the system may, imder the most favour- able circumstances, become a cause of gangTene after the ligatiu-e of the artei-y, is illustrated by the statement of Hodgson that, soon after the introduction of the Hunterian operation into Paris, it Avas the custom to employ repeated venesection in the cases operated on ; the consequence of Avhich was, that mortification Avas of frequent occru’rence. A more common cause of gangTene is the difficulty experienced Mj the venous Moocl in its return from the liml). This difficulty ahvays exists eAcn a\ enno mechanical obstacie impedes the return, being dejAendent on the aa ant o a proper vis d tergo to di’iA'e on the blood. The propulsive poAver of the eai ,gangrene following ligature. 311 the main agent in the venous circulation, is greatly diminished by being trans- mitted through the nairow and circuitous channels of the anastomosing vessels. This difficulty to the onward passage of the venous blood may, if there exist any cause of obstruction in the larger venous trunks, be readily increased to such an extent as to choke the collateral circulation, and so cause the limb to mortify. This mechanical obstacle may be dependent upon the occlusion of the \-ein by inflammation excited within it opposite the ligature, by its trans- fixion with the anem-ism-needle, or by its accidental wound with the knife in exposing the artery. When such an injmy, followed by inflammation, is inflicted on a vein, which, like the femoral, returns the gi-eat mass of blood from a limb, gangrene is the inevitable result. The supervention of erysipelas in the limb after the application of the ligature, though fortimately not of very frequent occurrence, is a som’ce of cmisiderable danger, being very apt to give rise to gangrene by the tension of the parts obstnicting the anastomosing circulation. I have on two occasions seen gangrene of the fingers, from this cause, follow ligatm’e of the vessels of the fore-aini. The abstraction of heat fr'om the limb, either directly by the application of cold, or indirectly by the neglect of sufficient precaution to keep up the tem- peratm’e of the part, often occasions gangrene : thus Sir A. Cooper saw mortifi- cation follow the appheation of cold lead-lotion to a limb in which the femoral artery had been tied ; and Hodgson witnessed the same result when the opera- tion was performed at an inclement season of the year. The incautious ap2Ai^a,tion of heat may, by overstimulating the returning circulation of the limb, especially about the period when the rising tempera- ture is an indication of increased action in the capillary vessels, occasion mortification. In this way the application of hot bricks and bottles to the feet has given rise to sloughing ; and Liston was compelled to amputate the thigh after ligatine of the femoral artery, for gangrene induced by fomenting the limb with hot water. The cpplicaVmi of a bandaye, even though very cautiously made, is apt to induce sloughing and gangrene. I have seen this happen when a roller was applied to the leg after ligature of the femoral artery, with a view of removing the oedema. The Period of Supervention of gangi’ene of the h’mb extends over the first three or four weeks after the hgatine of the vessel. It seldom sets in before the third day, but most frequently happens before the tenth. Character.—The gangrene fr’om ligatm’e of an artery is almost invariably of thp moist kind, on account of the implication of the veins. The limb fii’st becomes cedematous ; vesications then form ; and the skin assumes a piu-plish or greenish-black tint, rapidly extending up to the seat of operation. In some cases, though they are rare, simple mummification of the limb comes on ; the skin assuming a dull yeUowish-white hue, mottled by the streaks that corre- spond to the veins, and becoming di-y, horny, and shrivelled, about the extensor tendons of the instep. Treatment.—Much may be done with the view of preventing gangrene. Thus, the limb shoiild be elevated, wrapped up loosely in flannel or cotton- wadding, and laid on its outer side after the operation. If the weather be cold.312 ARREST OF ARTERIAL IIAEMORREAGE. hot-Wcater bottles may be piit into tbe bed, but not in contact with the limb. Should there be any appearance of stagnation of venous blood, the plan recom- mended by Gruthrie of employing continuous and methodical friction in a direction upwai’ds for twenty-four hoiu’S, so as to keep the superficial veins emptied, may be practised. When mortification has fairly set in, amputation of the limb should be per- formed at once as the only chance of saving life, in all those cases in which the patient’s constitutional powers are sufficiently strong to enable him to bear the shock of the operation. The limb should be removed at the seat of the original wound, or opposite the point at which the artery has been tied. In those cases, however, in which the gangrene follows injury of the femoral artery just below Poupart’s ligament, Guthrie advises that the amputation should be done below the knee, where the gangrene usually stops for a time. If the gangrene spread, with oedema or serous infiltration of the limb, the amputation should be done high up ; at the shoulder-joint, or in the upper third of the thigh. In these cases a large number of vessels usually require ligatm’e, having been enlarged by the collateral circulation.diffused traumatic aneurism. CHAPTER XV. TRAUMATIC ANEURISM AND ARTERIO-YENOUS WOUNDS. TRAUMATIC ANEURISM. Ne have hitherto discussed the treatruent of an injured artery having an open wound conununicating with it. It often happens, hoii evei, that the case is not so simple as has been described, but that, in addition to the wound in the vessel, there is subcutaneous extravasation of blood, with more or less pul- sation, tin-ill, and bruit, from the projection into it of the blood fr-om the wounded vessel. This extravasation constitutes a Traumatic Aneurism, and may ai’ise in three ways. 1. There may be an oblique or indirect punctiu’e into the arteiy, the blood frunished by which partly escapes from the w'ound, partly extravasates itself into the tissues around the vessel. 2. The pmictin-e in the integuments may have been closed by plaster or bandage ; and then no blood escaping externally, although the wound in the artery continues patent, the blood is forced out into the substance of the limb or part. 3. There may have been no external wound, but the artery may have been punctured or tom across subcutaneously, by the spicula of a fractiued bone, by a violent strain or twist of the limb, by the injury inflicted in a dislocation, or by the Surgeon in his efforts to reduce it. These traumatic aneurisms, in whatever way arising, are of two kinds, the Diffused and the Gircumscrihed. Diffused Teaumatic Aneurism.—This consists of an effusion of blood poured out by a wounded or ruptiued artery with which it communicates ; limited in extent by the pressure of surrounding parts, and partially coagulating in the meshes of the broken-down areolar tissue. It has no sac ; and its boundary, which is iU deflned, is composed partly of coagulum, and pai'tly of plastic material furnished by the tissues into which the blood is poured out, and has a constant tendency to extend under the pressiue of the fluid blood, which cemtinues to be projected into the centre of the tiunour. This form of traumatic aneurism is indicated by a subcutaneous, soft, and semi-fluctuating tmnour, often of very considerable size. At first the skin covering it is of its natural colour, but it gradually becomes bluish, and is thinned by the pressure to which it is subjected. If the wound in the vessel be rather large and free, there will be a distinct pulsation in the tumoiu syn- chronous wth the systole of the heart, accompanied by a thrilling, piuring, or jamng sensation, and often a distinct and loud bruit. In other cases, if the injured artery be small, or if the wound in it bo oblique, and of limited size, there may be no distinct pulsation or liruit ; the tumour being either indolent3H TliA UMAT 10 ANEUlilSM. ami so mi-fluctuating, or Imviiig an impulse communicated to it by tbe sulijacent artery. In those cases also in which the artery is torn completely across, or in whicli the ethised blood coagulates A'ery rapidly, the ordinary aneurismal bruit and pulsation may bo very obscure or cpiite absent. In such cases, the diagnosis of the true nature and gravity of the tumour may usually bo made by observing that the pulse in the arteries at a lower point is absent, and that there is great oedema of the limb. These tumom-s, if left to themselves, rarely undergo spontaneous cure, but they either increase in size imtil the integument covering them sloughs and ruptures, or the external wound, which has been temporarily plugged by coagu- lum, gives way ; or else they inflame and suppui'ate, pointing at last, like an abscess, and, on biu-sting, giving rise to a sudden gush of blood, whieh may at once, or by its rapid recurrence, prove fatal. In some cases a subcutaneous breach is made in the coagulated and plastic boundary, and, the blood becoming infiltrated into the areolar tissue, syncope, gangrene, and death follow. Treatment.—The treatment must be conducted on precisely the sajne plan as that of an mjm’ed artery communicating with an external w'oimd ; the only difference being that, in the case of the diffused traumatic aneurism, the aper- ture in the artery opens into an extravasation of blood instead of upon the surface. We must especially be upon our guard not to be misled by the term aneurism, and not to attempt to treat the condition, resulting from wound or subcutaneous laceration, by the means that we employ with success in the management of aneinism proper. In a pathological aneinism the blood is con- tained within a sac, which, as wiU hereafter be shown, is essential for the process of em’e of the disease. In the diffused traumatic aneinism there is no sac, properly speaking; and hence these changes to which a sac is necessary cannot take place. I doubt whether there is a case on record in which the Hunterian operation for aneurism, applied to the condition now imder consideration, has not terminated in danger or death to the patient, and in grievous disappoint- ment to the Surgeon. The proper treatment of diffused traumatic aneurism consists in laying open the tiunour by a stroke of the scalpel, removing the coagida, dissecting oi rather clearing out the artery, and hgatining it above and below the wound in it. This operation, easy in description, is most difiicidt and tedious in practice. The bleeding is often profuse ; the cavity that is laid open is large^ rao-ged, and partially filled with coagula ; it is often ivith much difficulty that the artery is foimd under cover of these, and in the midst of infiltrated and disorganised tissues ; and when it is found, it is not always easy to get a ligature to hold. It will be convenient to divide this operation into two stages l..Exposing the artery ; 2. Passmg the ligatime. First Stage.—The artery must, if at all practicable, be thoroug y com- pressed between the tumoim and the heart by a tourniquet, or by the hand ot an assistant. If it can be so commanded, the diffiised aneimsin may be at once and freely laid open ; but if not, the Surgeon must proceed ^^^oie cau- tiously. He must make a small aperture in the most prominent part of he tumour, and introduce two of the fingers of the left hand so as P ^ ' wound in the integuments, and prevent the escape of _ > time feeling for the opening in the artery, and pressing is u^ei ve upCIliCUMSCllIBED T1UU2IATIG ANEUBISM. 3^5 tliis. Hiuin<>' ascertained that he controls the vessel thoronghly by the pres- sure of his l5't index and middle fingers, he may proceed to slit open the wound in the integuments, and clear the clots and blood thoroughly out of the aneurismal timiour. Second Stage.—The Siu'gcon will now have ^exposed the part ot the aneurismal cavity. The artery must next be cleared for the application of the ligature. If the artery above be commanded by pressure, and there be no immediate danger of htemorrhagc, this may best be done by passing a steel probe, or, what is better, a fuU-sized bougie, or a sound into the open woimd in the artery so as to distend the vessel, dissecting down on each side of this through the posterior wall of the sac, and then passing the ligature in the usual way. But if the vessel be so near the centre of the circidation that it cannot be efficiently commanded, then the difficulties become far greater, for the Siu’geon must on no account remove his finger for an instant from the open wound ; but, keeping it firmly arrd securely pressed into this, he must errdeavom, by scratchirrg through the tissues above it, to expose the artery sirfficierrtly to make a dip with the rreedle around it, and thus to secure it. This part of the operation is by far the most difficidt in such cases, on account of the infiltration of the parts arrd the thickerring of the structures preventing the artery fi'om being readily distirrgirished and easily cleared. The application of a ligatrrre to the distal errd of the vessel, if it be com- pletely divided, is especially difficult. Shordd it not be practicable, the appli- cation of the actual cautery, or pressnre by means of a sponge-tent or graduated compress, wall be fourrd the best means of arresting the haemonffiage. CiEcmiscEiBED Teaumatic Aneueism differs entirely from the diffused in its pathology and treatment, inasmuch as it possesses a distinct sac. There are two varieties of this form of aneiu’ism. ]. In the first variety, a pmrctiu’e is made irr arr artery, or the vessel is ruptirred subcutaneously, as perhaps hr the reductiorr of an old dislocation; blood is extravasated irrto the adjoirrirrg tissues ; and, if there be an external apertru’e, this cicatrises. The blood that is extravasated becomes surrormded and limited by a dense layer of plastic matter, forming a distirrct circumscribed sac, which is soon hrred by layers of fibrine deposited fi'om the blood that jrasses through it. This tumour, usually of moderate size, arrd of tolerably firm corrsisterrcc, pirlsates syrrchrorrously with the beat of the heart, and has a distinct bruit, both of which cease when the artery leading to it is compressed. This form of circiunscribed traumatic arreirrism most commonly occrrrs from irunctured womrds of small arteries, as the temporal, plarrtar, palmar, radial, and ulnar. The Treatment to be adopted deperrds upon the size and sitrratiorr of the artery rvith which the tumoru is corrrrected. If the artery be small, and so situated that it can be opened without much sirbsequerrt irrconveirierrce to the patient, as on the temple or irr the fore-arm, it should be laid open, the coagula turTred out, arrd the vessel ligatured above arrd below the wourrd irr it. If the tumour be so situated, as in the pahn, that it Avould be difficidt arrd hazardous to the integr'ity of the patient’s hand to lay it open, the Hunterian operation for aneurism should be performed, asrvas successfully done hr a case (Fig. 131) in Avhich the brachial rvas ligatured for arr aneru-ism of this kind in the ball ofTil A UMATIC ANEURISM. ii6 Fig. 131. — Circmnscritied Trau- matic Aneurism in Ball of Tlmml) after a Powder-flask Explosion. the thumb, following serious injury to the hand from a powder-flask explosion. When it is connected with the superficial palmar arch I have, however, success- fully adopted the old operation of laying the tumour open, taking out coagula, and ligatiu’iiig the artery at the seat of injury. It is but rarely that this form of traumatic aneurism is coimected -with a large artery ; when it is, the vessel may be ligatured above, but close to the sac, in the same way as in the next variety. If this form of traumatic aneu- rism have increased greatly in bulk, so that the skin becomes thin and discoloiu’ed, or if in- flammation ensue, and symptoms of impending suppiu’ation take place around it, then it would be useless to hgatime the artery above the tumoiu-, as this would certainly give way, and secondary haemorrhage follow. Here the proper course is to lay open the sac, turn out the con- tents, and tie the artery above and below the part that is wounded. 2. The next form of circumscribed traumatic aneiu’ism is of rare occiuTence, and usually arises from a small puncture in a large artery, as the axillary or the carotid. The vessel bleeds freely ; but, the hfemorrhage being aiTested by pressure, the external wound and that in the artery close. The cicatrix in the artery gradually yields, forming, at the end of weeks or months, a tumom- which enlarges, dilates, and pulsates eccentrically, with distinct bruit, having aU the symptoms that characterise an aneurism from disease, and having a sac formed by the outer coat and sheath of the vessel. It is at first soft .and com- pressible on being squeezed, but becomes harder and firmer, and camiot be so lessened after a time. It consists of a distinct circimiscribed sac, formed by the dilatation of the cicatrix in the external coat and sheath of the artery, no blood being effused into the siuTounding tissues. The Treatment will vary according to the size of the tumour. ^ If this be small or but moderate in size, it consists in the hgature or compression of the artery leading to the sac, in accordance with the principles that guide us in the treatment of aneiu’ism from disease ; though, from the healthy state of the coats of the vessel, the artery may be hgatin-ed as near as possible to the sac. As there is a distinct cyst or sac in these circumscribed aneimsms, the changes that will be described in the chapter on the Treatment of Memisms in general take place; the tumom- graduaUy becoming consohdated, and eventuaUy absorbed. Should, however, the auem-ism have attained an enor- mous magnitude, or should it, fr’om being circumscribed, have become diffused by the rupture of the sac, then the tumour must be laid freely “le coagula turned out, and the artery ligatiu-ed as in the orduiaiy diffused aneurism. ARTERIO-VENOUS WOUNDS. A wound in an artery may communicate with a conespondiiig one in a contiguous vein, giving rise to two distinct forms o iscase neunsmaANEUmSMAL VAPJX. 3i7 Varix and Varicose Aneurism. Tliese preteraatni’al comniimications, which Avcre'fii-st noticed and accurately described by W. Hunter, most commonly happen at the bend of the arm, as a consequence of the punctime of the brachial artery m bleeding ; hut they have been met with in every part of the body in which an artery and vein lie in close juxtaposition, having been fomid to occur as a consequence of wounds of the subclavian, radial, carotid, temporal, iliac, femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries. The two forms of disease to which the preternatural communication between aideries and veins gives rise, differ so completely in their natme, symptoms, effects, and treatment, that separate consideration of each is required. ArfEURiSMAL Vaeix results when, a contiguous artery and vein having been perforated, adhesion takes place between the two vessels at the seat of injui’y, the comnnrnication between them continuing pervious, and a portion of the arterial blood beiug projected directly into the vein at each heat of the pulse. Opposite to the aperture of commimication between the two vessels, which is always rounded and smooth, the vein vdll be found to be dilated into a fusiform pouch, with thickened coats. The veins of the part generally are considerably enlarged, somewhat nodulated, tortuous, and thickened. The artery above the wound is dilated ; below, it is usually somewhat contracted. These pathological conditions are evidently due to a certain quantity of the arterial blood finding its way into the vein, and distending and irritating it by its pressure and presence, and less consequently being conveyed by the lower portion of the artery. The Ssrtnptoms consist of a timioiu' at the seat of injiuy, which can be emptied by pressure upon the arteiy leading to it, or by compressing its walls. If subcutaneous, this tmnom’ is of a blue or pimple colour, of an oblong shape, and wiU be seen to receive the dilated and tortuous veins. It will be foimd to pulsate distinctly "with a tremulous jarring motion, rather than a distinct impulse. Auscultation detects in it a loud and blomng, whiffing, rasping, or hissing sound, usually of a pecuharly harsh character. This soiuid has very aptly been compared by Porter to the noise made by a fly in a paper-bag, and by Liston to the sound of distant and complicated machinery. The thrill and sound are more distinct in the upper than in the lower part of the hmb, and are most perceptible if the hmb be allowed to hang down so as to become con- gested. Besides these local symptoms, there is usually some muscular weak- ness, together irith diminution in the temperature of the part supplied by the injured artery. Treatment.—As this condition, when once formed, is stationary, all operative interference should be avoided, an elastic bandage merely beiug applied. Should a case occim in which more than this is required, the artery must be cut down upon and ligatured on each side of the wound in it. Hohnes suggests that possibly in aneimismal varix a cime might be obtained by pressime directed solely to the orifice in the vein. Varicose Aneurism.—In this case the openings in the arteiy and vein do not directly communicate (see Figs. 133 and 135), but an aneimismal sac is formed between the two vessels, into which the blood is poured before passing into the vein. The Pathological Condition of this fonn of injury consists in the forma-TRAUMATIC ANEURISM. 318 tiou of a circumscribed false aneurism, communicatin'^ on one side with the artery, and on the other with the vein, Avhich is always in a state of varix. A varicose aneurism is, in fact, a circumscribed traumatic aneurism plus an aneurismal varix. Tliis condition is well represented in the annexed cuts.

Bell’s, in the Museum of University College, represent- ing a varicose aneinism before and after it had been opened (Figs. 132 to 134). In this case there appears to have been a high division of the brachial, and a com- municating branch below the wound, between the radial and ulnar; in con- sequence of which, as Mr. Shaw informs me, the Fig. 133.

Symptoms.—In the symptoms of varicose aneurism, we have a combination of the characters of aneinismal varix and of the circumscribed traumatic aneinism ; there is a pulsating tumoin, at first soft and compressible, but.

The sounds heard in these tumours are of two distinct kinds : there is the peculiai- buzzing thrill that always exists where there is a preteruatinal com-TREATMENT OF VARICOSE ANEURISM. 3^9 miinication bct^yeell an artery and vein ; besides this, there is a blowin" or bellon's sound, dependent on the anenrismal disease. These signs are most perceptible when the limb is in a dependent position; and the sonnds can often be heard in the veins at a considerable distance from the seat of injury. There is also some impairment in the nutrition and temperature of the parts supplied by the injured vessels. As the disease advances, the an- cnrismal tumour lying between the artery and vein continues to increase in size, and to become hardened by the deposition of laminated fibrine. If left to itself, it would probably continue to enlarge until sloughing of the integuments covering it occiuTed, followed by hmmoiThage. In some cases, the apertiu-e of com- munication betw^een the vein and sac becomes closed, and the aneiuism is con- verted into one of the false cncumscribed variety. Treatment.—The treatment of this disease must be conducted on different principles from those that have been laid down as required in the ordinary cir- cumscribed traumatic aueinism ; the difference depending upon the fact, that in the varicose aneurism there is always a double aperture in the sac, and that thus the proper deposition of laminated fibrine necessary for its occlusion can- not take place. The sac of such an aneinism may be compared to one that has been ruptm-ed, or accidentally opened, in which we could consequently not expect the occinrence of those changes that are necessary for the cine of anemism by the Hunterian operation. In a varicose aneinism, consequently, the sac must be fr-eely incised, and the arteiy tied on each side of the punctine in it. This procedure may, unless the Singeon be careful, and properly understand the pathology of this disease, be attended by some difficulty (Fig. 135). The operation may, hoivever, be gi-eatly simplified by exsanguinating the limb by means of the elastic roUer and the tourniquet. If this ingenious device be adopted, the Surgeon will be able to see cleai’ly what he is about. After the first incision has been made through the integuments, the dilated vein will be laid open, and an apertme will be .seen at the bottom of the vessel, fr'om which arterial blood may be made to issue by relaxing the tourniquet. If an attempt be made to find the artery immediately below this aperture, the Surgeon ivill be disappointed, for the saq of the ciremn- scribed aneurism intervenes between the tw^o vessels. That this aperture leads into the sac, and not into the artery, may readily bo ascertained by introducing a probe into it, wffiich will be seen to be capable of being carried sidew'ays, as well as upwards and doivnwards, to a considerable extent, and in different directions altogether out of the course of the artery. In order to expose this vessel properly, a probe-pointed bistoury must be introduced into this openino-, and the sac of the false aneurism slit up to its full extent, the coagula turned out, and the puncture in the artery sought for in the bottom of the°cavity that has been exq)oscd ; this may now' readily be made visible by the escape of a jet Fig. 135.—The opened Tumour removed from its Connexions. Application of Ligatirres.320 ARTERIO-VENOUS WOUNDS. of arterial blood on relaxing the pressiu’e on the upper part of the artery ; a ligature must then bo passed above and below the wound, and the cavity lightly dressed -with lint. Yanzetti has recorded a case of varicose aneurism of the brachial artery cured in six hours by digital compression, applied simultaneously to the artery aboA'e the tumom’, and to the orifice leading from the sac into the vein. Franzolini cined a case in the same way, after sixty days’ compression, at iiTO- gidar intervals. In Fischer’s tables are twelve cases of varicose aneurism, nine of which were cnred by digital compression. In at least four of these cnres it was applied as above described. It seems therefore that digital pressure is a hopefril mode of treating such cases.321 ANEURISMAL VARIX IX THE NECK. CHAPTER XVI. WOUNDS OF SPECIAL BLOOD-VESSELS.* VESSELS OE THE HEAL AND NECK. Carotid Artery.—Wounds of the Carotid Artery, and of its primary and secondary divisions, are more frequent in civil practice than similar injiu’ies of any other set of arteries in the body, in consequence of the neck being fi-equently the seat of suicidal attempts. The hmmorrhage from wounds of the main trunk is so copious as often to be immediately fatal. In the event of a Siu’geon being at hand, both ends of the bleeding vessel must be at once hgatmed. Should the haemon-hage, whether primary or secondary, proceed from a deep branch, as the internal maxillary, deep temporal, or internal carotid, so situated as not to admit of the vessel being exposed and hgatured at the seat of wound, the oi-dinary rule of practice of tyhig a wounded artery at the seat of injury must be departed from, and the common carotid tied in the neck. In consequence of the speedy fatahty of the wounds of the carotid artery and its branches. Traumatic Aneurisms are rarely met with in this situation ; they do, however, occasionally occur, and the records of surgery contain at »least six instances of the kind, in each of which the common carotid was tied, and the patient ultimately recovered. Aneurismal Varix in the Neck, dependent on puncture of the Internal Jugular Vein and Carotid Artery, usually the result of sword-thi'usts, is apparently of more frequent occmi’ence than traumatic aneurism in this region ; probably owing to the close proximity of the vein rendering it difficult for the artery to be wounded on the outer or anterior sides, without ffi’st perforating- that vessel. The symptoms offer the general characteristics of anemismal varix, liut have several points that are worthy of special remai'k. The womid of the vessels has been in every instance followed by the effusion of a large quantity of blood into the loose areolar tissue of the neck ; the extravasation acquirmg even the size of a child’s head, and threatening immediate suffocation. As this exfravasation subsided, the ordinary characters of anemismal vaiix began to manifest themselves. The period at which these symptoms first made their appearance varied somewhat in the different cases, but they always occm’red within four or five days of the receipt of the injury. In none of the cases did the disease appear to shorten life, or to occasion any dangerous or inconvenient effects, with the exception of some difficulty in lying on the affected side, and occasional giddiness or noise in the head on stooping. No operation is admissible in these affections. Vol. the various arteries viii he found iu VOL. I. Y322 WOUNDS OF SPECIAL BLOOD-VESSELS. Varicose Aneurism is very rarely met A\ith in this situation. There is indeed only one case on record. It was situated close to the skull, and resulted from a bullet woimd. TempobAL Artery.—Traumatic Aneurism of the Temporal Artery, and of its branches, occasionally occurs as the result of partial division of these vessels in cupping on the temple. I have met with two cases of this kind, in both of which the disease was readily cm-ed by laying the tumour open, turning out its contents, and tying the artery on each side of it. Htcmorrhage fr’om the Deep Arteries of the Face, as in gun-shot injuries, if too copious to be restrained by cold, requires the hgatm-e of the common or external carotid. Vertebral Artery.—Wounds of the vertebral artery occasionally occm’ as the result of stabs in the neck; and several cases of traumatic aneurism in this situation have been recorded. In these wounds there is a danger of mistaking the source of the htemorrhage, as pressure on the carotid, if made below the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, arrests the flow of blood in the vertebral as well, which, up to this point, hes immediately beneath it. This transverse process is at least twm inches above the cla^dcle, and hes much higher than is usually supposed. There are no less than eleven cases on record, in which the carotid has been tied for a wound of the vertebral, in con- sequence of this mistake. When the woimd of the artery is situated between two transverse processes, ligature is almost impossible, and the Siugeon will be obhged to trust to plugging the wound, and to the use of styptics. The recorded cases of this injiny are fully reviewed by Holmes in his lectiues on the Surgical Treatment of Aneurism. VESSELS OP THE UPPER LIMB. SuBCLAVlAE" Artery.—A Wound of the Subclavian Artery may almost invariably be looked upon as fatal ; though, in consequence of the manner in which the vessel is protected by the clavicle, this injm’y can scarcely occm- except from gun-shot violence. From the rapidly fatal natm-e of woimds of the subclavian artery. Traumatic Aneurisms in this situation are not met with ; but where the artery passes into the axilla below the margin oi the first rib, they are not unfrequent. Aneurismal Varix, residting from wound of the Siibdavian Artery and Vein, has been seen, notivithstanding the separation that exists between the two vessels throughout their whole extent. These injm-ies have hkeiyise usually been the result of sword-thrusts, and do not admit of any sm-gicai interference. . Axillary Artery.—In Open Wounds of tbe Axillary Artery and of its Branches, the rule of practice consists in cutting down upon the bleeding > vessel and ligaturing it on each side of the wound. It must be borne m mind that, the arterial branches given off between the lower edge of the first rib and the fold of the axilla being very numerous, a pimctm-ed wound of the axilla or side of the chest may injure one of these vessels ; though tiom its com sc, anc the fr-ee flow of arterial blood that has followed the stab, it maybe supposed that the axillary artery itself has been punctured. The particular vessel iiijm-ed canTRAUMATIC AXILLARY ANEURISM 323 : I I only be ascertained by following up the wound, and ligaturing the artery that furnishes the blood. In some cases, however, the state of the parts may be such, that it may be impossible to trace the artery at the depth at which it is situated, or even to expose it in a more superficial situation, as in the stump after amputation at the shoulder-joint. In these circimistanees, the rule of hgaturing an artery at the scat of injm-y may be departed from, and the main trunk should be tied either above or below the claviele ; and the success of this operation has been sufficient to justify om- having recourse to it, rather than exhaust the patient by any prolonged attempts at the ligature of the vessel in the open womid, though I think that this ought fu'st to be attempted. Of 15 cases in which the artery has been ligatincd either above or below the clavicle, for hemorrhage fr-om womids in the axilla or from stiunps, I find that 9 were ciu’ed and 6 died. Although the success is about equal in whichever situation the vessel be tied, I should certainly give the preference to the supraclavicular operation, owing to the greater facihty of its performance, and the comparative absence of col- lateral branches at the seat of ligatm’e. In some cases, however, especially after amputations at the shoulder, the claviele is pushed up at its acromial end, and then the artery might be best reached below the clavicle, imder or thi-ough the pectoral muscles. Traumatic Aneurism in the Axilla is not of unfrequent occuiTencc, arising directly from gun-shot wounds, or fr’om the thrust of a knife, sabre, or other pointed weapon. In some cases the injiny arises from a subcutaneous ruptiu’e of the vessel, the patient stretching out and straining his arm in an attempt to save himself fr’om falling, and feehng a sudden snap in the axilla, which is followed rapidly by the formation of a diffused aneurism. There are several cases on record in which axillary aneurism has resulted from violent attempts made by the Surgeon in the reduction of old-standing dislocations of the head of the humerus. Thus PeUetan mentions a case of this kind, in which the tumoiu, being supposed to be emphysematous, Avas opened, and the patient perished of haemorrhage. Warren relates a case of diflFiised axillary aneurism resulting from rupture of the artery, in consequence of the Surgeon attempting to reduce a dislocation of the humerus by using his foot as a fulcrum in the axilla, but Avithout taking off his boot. Gribson has related thi’ee cases of axillary aneurism following rupture of the ai’tery, in the attempt to reduce old-standing dislocations Avith the pulleys. These cases are of much interest to the Siugeon, as showing the necessity for great caution in the use of poAverfril extenduig force in the reduction of old dis- locations, adhesions having possibly formed betAveen the artery and head of the bone. [ In those cases of diffused traumatic aneurism of the axiUa that arise from I subcutaneous rupture or laceration of the artery, the condition of pai’ts is I essentially the same as in the case of an open wound of the vessel, Avith the ij exception of the absence of any external aperture in the integuments. In these 'I cases a turuour ot considerable size, hard or fluctuating, according to the state ^ 0 coagulation ot its contents, forms with more or less rapidity. IfithaA’e i’ quickly, the artery being torn across, and the blood coagulating as I 'i is effused, it will not present the ordinary aneiuismal signs, but may merely Y 2 i324 WOUNDS OF SPECIAL BLOOD-VESSELS. resemble an ordinary exti’avasafcion ; from this, howevei’, it may be distin- guished by the loss of the pulse at the wist, and by the oedema of the arm. If it fonn slowly, the blood continuing fluid, there will be the usual signs of aneurism, such as thrill, pulsation, and a gushing hot sensation. In all these cases, there is much oedema of the arm, with a tendency to inflammation, sup- puration, and sloughing of the tiunour and the parts amongst Avhich it lies, ATith perhaps gangTene of the limb itself. Some of these traumatic axillary anem-isms have a tendency to diffuse them- selves AAdth great rapidity, filhng up the Avhole of the hollow of the armpit, and extending under the pectoral muscles, CA’cn up around the shoulder. In other cases again, when more circumscribed, the disease may get well spontaneously, as happened in cases recorded by Van SAvieten, Sabatier, and Hodgson. In other instances again, the disease has remained stationary for years, or has eA'en undergone consolidation imder medical treatment. It cannot, however, be considered sound practice to leave a traumatic aneurism of this artery Avdthout sm-gical interference, after the ordinary dietetic and hygienic plans of treat- ment haA'e failed in effectmg a cure, for it may at any time become rapidly diffused, or inflame and suppm’ate. The Treatment of traumatic axillary aneiu’ism must depend not only on the question whether it be diffused or circumscribed ; but, if diffused, AAfrether it be of recent origin, or have originated fr’om puncture or fr’om subcutaneous ruptm-e or laceration of the vessel as a consequence of dislocation, fractiue, bloA\', or strain. When a diffused traumatic aneurism of recent origin, rapid foimation, and dependent upon punctiu’e of the artery, is met Avuth m the axilla, the treatment must be conducted in the same way as that of a wounded artery, Anthout extra- vasation, in this situation. As Gruthrie veiy justly observes, it can make no difference whether the pimctiu’e in the skin has healed or not—the condition of the artery must be the same. The tumom’ should be laid open, the coagnla turned out, the artery sought for, and hgatiu’ed where wounded. There is, however, danger after this operation, either of secondary hsemon-hage coming- on fr-om the seat of womid, by blood conveyed through the collateral vessels Avhich open into the subscapular and circumflex arteries ; or else of the hmb falling into a state of gangrene. In either case, amputation of the shoulder and thi’ough the anemismal extravasation is the only practice that holds out a chance of hfe to the patient. In diffused traumatic aneurism of the axilla from subcutaneous ruptiue or laceration of the axillary artery, the choice would lie betAveen treating the injiuy by direct incision, and ligaturing the vessel above the clavicle. The hgatm-e of the vessel above the clavicle has been done thi-ee times, with only oSe recovery, two of the patients dying of gangrene and secondary hmmorrhage. ■ In the successful case, secondary hmmoirhage had ocemred ; and gangrene ot the arm, Avhich thiuatened, Avas prevented, and the patient saved, by amputa- tion at the shoulder-joint. The result, therefore, of ligature is so little promis- ing, that few Siugeons would be disposed, in the face of these facts, to repeat this operation. , The only other altcrnatiA'e consists of treating the luptiuc ai uy on ic same principle as a wounded one, disregarding the accidental complication otTRAUMATIC AXILLARY ANEURISM. 325 the subcutaneous accumulation of a few oimces or pounds of blood. Tins undoubtedly is the proper surgical principle on which to act in these cases. Its adoption has been strongly urged by Guthrie, and its advantage has been demonstrated by the success attending it in several cases in which it has been adopted by Paget, Syme, and others. The operation consists in compressing the subclavian'above the clavicle, either by the direct pressui-e of the finger, or, as was done by Syme in his case, by previously making an incision o\'er it, through which it could be more readily commanded ; then laying the tumour open by a free incision through the anterior fold of the axilla and the pectoral muscles, turning out the coagula, and seeking for and ligaturing the artery at both ends ; for it must be remembered, that the distal extremity of the tom vessel 'will probably bleed freely, owing to the open anastomoses round the shoulder. Circumscribed Traumatic Aneurisms of the Axillary Artery are not imcommonly of slow formation, existing for several months or years before they require operation, although resulting from punctured wound of the armpit. In chronic cases of this kind, the aneurism is necessarily provided with a finn and distinct sac, and approaches closely in its characters to the pathological, form of the disease. The Treatment here cannot be conducted on the principles that guide us in the management of a wound, or of a diffused aneiu’ism of recent occurrence of this artery ; for not only is the circumscribed aneurism provided with a sac, but the vessel at the point injured will very probably be found to have undergone changes that render it little able to bear the appbeation of the ligature. It vdll be softened, thickened, and lacerable, ■with perhaps a ■wide funnel-shaped apertiue leading into the sac, which ■will be closely incorporated with the neighbouring parts. But, indeed, the treatment of this form of circumscribed traumatic aneurism by the bgatiue of the artery on the proximal side of the sac, has been found to be attended ■with remarkable suc- cess. In eight recorded cases in which this operation has been performed, not one fatal result has been noted. In all, the aneiuism arose from stabs or gun- shot womids, and had existed for various periods, between two weeks and four yeai’s. In foiu of the cases the artery was ligatm’ed above, and in four below the clavicle ; and in one case of each category there was suppiuation of the sac. The particular point at which the artery should be ligatiued must depend upon the condition of the tumour. If this be of large size, or arise fi’om the upper part of the axillary artery above or immediately below the pectoralis mipor muscle, there is no choice but to deligate the vessel above the clavicle. Should, however, the principal increase in the tumour take place in a direction downwards and forwards under the great pectoral muscle, the portion of the artery immediately below the clavicle appearing to be ft-ee from disease, the question would arise as to whether this part might not be selected for the ap- plication of the ligatiuc ; and as the results of both operations have hitherto been equally favoiuable, this must rather be determined by the peculiarities iu each case than on more general grounds. Most Surgeons, I think, would how- ever prefer ligaturing the artery above the clavicle, as being a simpler proceeding than tying it below that bone ; which, moreover, has the disadvantage of bring^ o to326 WOUNDS OF SPECIAL BLOOD-VESSELS. iiig the scali)el into ■\'ciy close proximity with the sac, which, were it to stretch upwards imder the pectoralis minor to a gi’eatcr extent than could he discernible externally, might possibly be opened by the knife, as has even happened in ojDerating aboA^e the claA'iclc. It has been recommended to apply the ligature between the sac and the origins of the subscapular and posterior circumflex arteries, beloAV the former and above the latter ; but this is an anatomical impossibility, if the aneurism be situated above the lower border of the axilla. Compression of the artery on the distal side of the tumour succeeded in curing the disease in a case that Avas under Gloldsmith of Vermont. Brachial Artery.—The haemorrhage from Wounds of the Brachial Artery may sometimes be an’ested by the employment of methodical compres- sion, but usually it requires the ordinary ligature on each side of the aperture. This vessel may occasionally be punctiued in A'enesection. This accident, AA'hich Avas formerly of frequent occurrence Avhen venesection Avas practised by professed phlebotomists, now very rarely happens. Should a Surgeon be so unfortunate as to puncture the brachial arteiy in this Avay, he may prevent injiuious consequences by keeping up a proper degvee of pressure, by means of a graduated comj)ress ajiphed immediately on the occiurence of the accident. With this view, the fingers, hand, and fore-arm having been A'eiy carefully padded and bandaged, a Avell-made graduated compress should be fli-mly applied over the seat of pimctiue, and retained there for at least ten days or a fortnight. Should the aperture in the artery not be closed in this way, either a circumscribed false aneurism, a varicose aneiuism, or an aneiuismal varix AAull form, according to its situation in relation to the A'ein. In the Circumscribed Traumatic Aneurism at the bend of the arm, folloAxing a wound of the brachial artery, Ave have the usual soft or semi-solid pulsating tumoiu’, which can readily be emptied on pressure, and possesses more or less bruit. This disease may be treated in one of three ways : 1, by com- pression upon or above the tumour ; 2, by ligaturing the artery leading to it ; or 3, by cutting through the sac, and deligating the A'essel on each side of the apertiu’e in it. The compression of the tumoiu’ has often been successfully practised. It may be done by means of a graduated compress on the tumour, and the appli- cation of a ring-tourniquet over the arteiy : the tumoiu’ becoming consohdated, and gradually undergoing absorption. In employing compression great care must be taken, however, not to induce sloughing of the tissues over the tumoin- by sudden and too forcible pressm’e. The limb should be carefully bandaged up and maintained in the semi-flexed position. Should this plan not succeed, we must be guided in oiu ulterior measiues by the particular conditions of the case. If the tumoiu be of recent origin, soft and compressible, or, though of longer diuation, large, Anth a thin sac, and danger of becoming difiFuscd, it ^ should be treated by direct incision, and the arteiy be deligated on each side of the wound in it. Should, hoAvever, the tumour be small, or but of moderate size, and the sac be tolerably thick and fim, so as to admit of the deposit of laminated fibrine, Ave may treat it by deligatioii of the brachial aitciy, ei er in the middle of the arm, or, as Anel did Avith success, immediately above the tumour. In the event, however, of the disease not being cuied in t s Aiay, incision of the sac must be had recourse to, as I have kiiOAni to be iiecessaiy inVESSELS OF FORE-ARM AND HAND. 327 a case in which the brachial artery was tied above the tumour, which was large, with a thin sac, the pulsations returning in a few days, and the tumoui’ con- tinuing to enlarge. _ Varicose Aneurism, at the bend of the arm, presents the ordinary cha- racter of the disease. Occasionally, though i-arely, it would appear- that the aperture of communication between the anem-ismal sac and the vein becomes closed, and thus the vai-icose is converted into the ordinary circumscribed traumatic aneurism. The Treatment of this affection must be conducted on different principles from that of the ordinary circumscribed variety ; for whatever be the density of the sac, it is never, as has already been explained (p. 319), a perfect one, having always an opening into the vein which would prevent its proper- closure by the deposit of laminated fibrine. In foru" cases related by Sabatier, which were treated by Aiiel’s operation, amputation became necessary in two ; and, in the other cases, the operation by incision of the sac was required before a cure could be effected. The sac must therefore be laid open, and the vessel tied on each side of it in the way that has been recommended hr the treat- ment of varicose aneurism, and with the caution there laid down. If the varicose anernism be converted, after a few days, into the circumscribed form, the apertm-e into the vein becoming occluded, ligature of the arter-y above the sac may be successfully employed, or compression may succeed in curing the disease. In Aneurismal Varix of the ar-m, a roller and compress are aU that can be required. Vessels of the Foee-aem ahd Palm.—The arteries of the fore-ar-m are very commonly woimded by pieces of glass or earthenware, or by knives. In every case the bleeding point must be cut down upon, and both ends of the vessel tied. This rule is peculiarly imperative in this situation, on account of the freedom of the anastomosis through the palmar arches. In many of these cases the bleeding is at first very free, but, being arrested by pressme, does not break out again until eight or ten days have elapsed ; when, the arm being much infiltrated with blood, inflamed, and swollen, double ligatm-e of the vessel at the seat of injury has to be practised under somewhat difficult and unfavourable circumstances. Traumatic Aneurism of the Radial and Ulnar Arteries usually assumes the circumscribed form, owing to the pressure employed at the time of injiuy confining the extravasation. If it be small and recent, and situated superficially at the lower part of the fore-arm, or if it be in any way diffused, the better plan is to cut down upon and through the tumour at once, ligaturing the vessel on each side. If, however, the aneurism be deeply seated amongst the mass of muscles at the upper part of the fore-arm, near the elbow-joint, the wound having healed, and the soft parts covering it being healthy and firm, the advice given by Liston appears to be most judicious :—rather than cutting through the muscles and detaching their connections, he recommends that the aneurism should be left to attain some consistence, and then that the brachial artei-y be seemed in the mid-ai-m. In such cases as these, also, compression of the brachial, with moderate pressme on the tumour itself, has c fleeted a cmo.328 WOUNDS OF SPECIAL BLOOD-VESSELS. Wounds of the Palmar Arches not nnlTcquently occur from the breaking 0 glass or chma in the hand, or stabs Irom some pointed instrument, and are always troublesome to manage. If the Surgeon sees the case shortly after the infliction of the wound, he may endeavour, by enlarging the aperture to a moderate extent, and with due attention to the tendons and nerves of the part, to secure the bleeding vessel. Should he fail in doing this, which he certainly will if it be the deep arch that is injured, a gi-aduated compress must be well and fii-mly applied. If this be properly done, it will very commonly be an effective means of arresting the hiemorrhage. If it be loosely and ineffectually put on, it will be worse than useless. The proper mode of putting on this compress is as follows. A toimiiquet having been applied on the brachial artery, the wound must be carefully cleared of all foreign bodies, and wiped dry ; each finger is then to be separately and carefully bandaged. A wooden splint is then to be put on the back of the hand and the lower part of the fore-arm. A firm well-made graduated compress IS now to be placed with the apex downwards on the wound, so as to bring and press the edges together, and seem-ely bandaged against it. The circulation through the limb should still, if possible, be controlled with a ring-toumiquet, applied on that artery above the wrist which appears most to correspond with the arch wounded, or better still, on the brachial itself; or the elbow may be forcibly flexed, and the fore-arm bandaged to the arm in this position, so that the hand rests upon the shoulder. The compress and limb must be left undisturbed for at least five or six days, when, the brachial being compressed, the dressings may be taken off, and the state of the pahn examined. Should the wound be healing and look well, the hand- splint and compress may be re-apphed ; but should the pahn be sloughy and infiltrated, with a tendency to htemorrhage, it will be useless again to resort to compression, and other means must be employed. Should an ineffectual attempt have been made to arrest the primary haemor- rhage, or should the case not be seen until several days have elapsed, when secondary haemorrhage has occurred, and the palm has become infiltrated and swollen, pressm’e can no longer be borne upon the seat of injury, and it is useless to endeavour to search for the injured vessel in the midst of sloughy and infiltrated tissues, through a narrow wound which cannot be enlarged without danger of disorganising the hand. In these chcumstances, it is necessary to deviate from the ordinary rule of practice in wounded arteries, and the Hunterian operation must be performed. The Singeon may either tie both arteries above the wi’ist, or at once dehgate the brachial. Both methods of treatment have then advocates. I prefer the simultaneous hgatm’e of the two arteries of the fore-arm, just above the wrist, where they are superficial and very easily reached. In several cases under my care, the radial and ulnar, immediately above the hand, have been tied at the same time with complete success, and I have never seen a case in which this operation has failed ; but should it do so, or should haemorrhage occur after this, as might happen in the case of an enlarged median or interosseous artery, the Surgeon must ha'se recom-se to compression or ligature of the brachial. Circumscribed Traumatic Aneurism iu the Palm is by no means of fr’equent occuiTcnee. It may, however, follow wounds of the pahnar arches.INJURIES OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 329 In such a case as this, it would be clearly out of the question to lay open the sac, and to search for the injured vessel in the midst of the aponeurotic and tendinous structures of the hand. It would consequently be necessary, either to tie the radial and ulnar arteries immediately above the wist, or to ligature ' the brachial in the middle of the arm. The latter plan should be prefeived ; as, were the first mode of treatment put into practice, the sac might continue to lie fed by the interosseous artery, as happened in a case of Roux’s, in which the patient died of htemorrhage from the palmar aneurism after the ligature of both arteries of the fore-ax’m. In the case represented (Fig. 131), Liston successfully ligatured the brachial in the mid-arm, after compression upon it had failed to effect a cure. VESSELS OF THE LOWER LIMB. Fkmoral Autery.—The htemorrhage from the Femoral Artery, Com- mon, Superficial, or Deep, when wounded is always very profuse. In all cases, ligature of the Avoimded vessel at the seat of injury should, if possible, be practised. If a Diffused Traumatic Aneurism have already formed, the artery shoidd be commanded by a tommiquet, as it passes over the brim of the pelvis, the sac laid open, and the bleeding vessel sought for and tied. Guthrie has col-, lected a great number of cases, which prove incontestably that the general principles of treatment in wounded arteries must not be departed from, when the arteries of the groin or thigh are wounded. On the contrary, the facility wth which in most cases the circulation is kept up, and the readiness with which secondary hEemorrhage comes on as a consequence of the free anastomoses in this situation, render the rule of practice of applying a ligature on each side of the wound in the vessel peculiarly stringent in all recent arterial wounds in this part of the body. Secondary htemorrhage and gangrene of the limb are the gi-eat sources of danger here. "When gangrene is imminent, or has come on, amputation is necessarily the sole resource. With regard to secondary hasmoirhage supervening after ligatime of the artery at the seat of injury, there is, I think, no safe course but removal of the limb. lATiere the artery has been tied higher up, as, for instance, when the external iliac has been ligatured for recent wounds or traumatic aneurisms in the groin or upper part of the thigh, the hjemoirhage appears to have returned, or gangrene to have supervened in all the cases. This fact was remarkably illustrated in the Crimean Wai\ Thus, Macleod states that the French in one hospital at Constantinople ligatured the femoral at a distance from the wound for secondary haemorrhage seven times, an,d that all the cases failed. If the traumatic aneurism have assumed a drcumscriied character, it must be treated on the principles laid dowi for this form of the disease, the supply- ing artery being ligatured above the tumour ; and cases are not wanting in proof of the success of this practice. It occasionally, though rarely, happens that a Varicose Aneurism is formed in the p-oin or upper part of the thigh, as the result of wound of the artery and vein in this situation. It usually presents the ordinary chai'acters of this isease, but some peculiarities have occasionally been met with. Thus, in a case related by Horner, there was a wavy motion in the femoral \cm on the33° WOUNDS OF SPECIAL BLOOD-VESSELS. nuinjuicd side, aiisiiig ftom the blood in tho \\^ouiided vessel coniinuiiicatiiig’ u thrill iipwards to that contained in the vena cava. In a case related by lilor- rison, it is stated that a tnuionr, as large as the Innnan uterus at the third month of pregnancy, communicated with the injured vein. The Treatment of this disease is exceedingly unsatisfactory. Of four cases in which the external iliac artery was tied, a fatal termination occun-ed in every instance ; two of the patients dying of gangrene of the limb, and the remaining two of secondary ha3mon’hage and consecutive pneumonia. It has consecpiently been proposed by Guthile that the tumoiu- be laid open, and tho artery seem-ed above and below the aperture in it. As this plan has never been fairly put into practice, it would perhaps be useless to speculate on the chances of success likely to attend it; yet we must bear iu mind, that laying open an anem-ism of this kind in the groin is a very different matter from adopting the same pro- cediu’e at the bend of the arm, or in a situation where the Surgeon can readily command the artery on the proximal side of the sac. The gush of blood from so large an artery as the common femoral would be so great that, with whatever rapidity the operation were performed, there would be considerable risk of the patient suffering a fatal hasmorrhage, before the vessel, matted and incoi-porated as it would be with surrounding parts, could be separated and secured; and the ligatiu’e of the vessel would probably be foUoAved by gangrene of the limb. The danger of a fatal result from immoderate haemon-hage has noAv been com- pletely obviated by the use of the aorta-compressor. Vessels oe the Leg and Foot.—Deep stabs, cuts, and gunshot wounds of the leg may be followed by profuse heemoiThage from a wounded arteiy. It may not always be easy to determine with accmacy which of the arteries is Avounded: whether it be one of the tibials, the peroneal, or only large muscular branches. This is more especially the case when, in consequence of fractm-e, a pulsatory extravasation of blood fonns in the calf. When there is an open Avoimd, the direction taken by it Avill probably enable the Simgeon to solve the question. In the Treatment of arterial bleeding from the leg—^whether calf or front— the Sin-geon may, especially if it be not very profuse, try to an-est it by com- press, bandage, and position. Should these modes fail, recoiu’se must be had to operation. When the Posterior Tibial Artery is wounded, there is no reason to deviate from the usual principle of treating a primary haemon-hage fr’om a AAroimded artery, viz., to cut doAvn on the vessel at the seat of injury, and tie it above and below the woimd on it. The same rule of treatment apphes to Wounds of the Anterior Tibial and Peroneal Arteries. In performing this operation, if the posterior tibial be woimded in the upper tAAro-thirds of its course, the Siu’geou aatU have to cut freely by the side of or through the muscles of the calf. This he must do in the dfrection of their fibres, injuring them by transverse incision as httle as possible ; and, by taking the track of the woimd as his guide, the bleeding vessel wiU at last be reached, and must then be tree in the usual way. Such an operation practised on a person Avith a muscular limb that is infiltrated with blood and inflammatory effusions, is in the hig cst degree difficult. In the lower third of the leg the arteries are superficial, and reached with comparative ease.331 GLUTEAL ARTERY. When the hfemon-hagc is not primary, but consecutive, or if a difPused anenrism have formed, with or without external wound, as in the case of frac- ture, Surgeons have occasionally had recoiu’se to the ligatm-e of the superficial femoral artery, with success. The artery may be tied in Scarpa’s triangle, or, what would, I think, be better in such a case, in Hunter’s canal. When ligature fails, amputation is necessarily the only resoiu’ce. In one of the suc- cessful cases S. Cooper ligatined the popliteal—a plan that has found favoin- with the French Surgeons. In another, Dupuytren tied the supeifrcial femoral for a pistol-bullet wound in the leg. The others Avere cases of diffrised aneurism, arising from a secondary hcemorrhage occurring in the course of a fracture. The subject of Wound of the Tibial Arteries as a result of fracture of the tibia, Avill be more fuUy discussed in Chapters XX. and XXI. Smsfil Circumscribed Aneurisms are occasionally met with in the foot, in consequence of Avound of one of the plantar arteries, as in operations for club-foot. If pressure have failed in preventing or curing the disease, the only coiuse left to the Surgeon is to lay the tiunoiu open, and to ligature the artery on each side in the usual way. Gluteal Auteey.—Traumatic Aneurisms of the Gluteal Artery are of less frequent occiuTence than might d priori have been imagined, from the situation of the vessel exposing it to injiuy. These aneiuisms may acquire an enormous size. In John Bell’s celebrated case, the tumom’ is said to have been of “prodigious size,” and to hax’e contained eight pounds of blood. In Syme’s case the tumoiu’ Avas as large as a man’s head at the base, occupied the whole hip, and rose into a blunt cone. The Treatment that should be adopted in these cases is to compress the aorta by means of Lister’s toimiiquet; then to lay open the tumoiu freely, tm’u out its contents, and pass a hgatiue by means of an aneiuism or mevus needle round the short trunk of the gluteal as it emerges fr’om the pehis.332 ENTRANCE OF AIR INTO VEINS. CHAPTER XVII. ♦ ENTRANCE OF AIR INTO VEINS. The Entrance of Air into a "WoundecI Vein, thougli an accident of rare occurrence, is one that occasions such peculiar and alarming symptoms, that it becomes necessary to be acquainted Avith the circumstances attending it; and its study is the more interesting to the practical Siu’geon, as it is chiefly in the course of operations that this condition occm-s. In siu'gical practice, we meet only with sjmitaneous admission of air into the circulation. This was first observed in the year 1818, in a case in which the internal jugular vein was opened during the removal of a large tumour from the right shoulder by Beauchesne. The investigation of this subject is con- sequently a comparatively recent matter, in Avhich the labours of the Commis- sioners of the French Academy are conspicuous, and the names of Magendie, Amussat, Cormack, and Wattmann are distinguished. Results op Experiments on Animals.—As cases of the entry of air into the A-eins comparatively seldom occiu- in man, it is necessary to study the phenomena accompanying it on the lower animals. It has long been knoAvm to physiologists that the forcible introduction of air into the circulation would kill an animal; and Morgagni, Valsalva, Bichat, and Nysten have made this a subject of observation and experiment. The death of the animal in these cases appears to be dependent partly on the quantity of air injected, and partly on the rapidity Avith which it is thrown in. Bichat supposed that a single bubble injected into the cu’culation killed the animal Avith the rapidity of lightning ; but this is erroneous, as shoAAui by Nysten. I have on several occasions injected two or three cubic inches of air into the jugular vein of a dog, without producing death, though much distress resulted. The rapidity Avith which the air is throAvn in exercises a considerable influence upon the result. If bloATO in quickly, a small quantity may kill; if throAAm in^ slowly and graduaUy, a large quantity may be injected Arithout destroying hfe, the blood appearing to absorb and carry away the gaseous fluid. In experiments Avhich I have made on the subject, I have observed the following phenomena in cases Avhere death Avas produced. On exposing the internal jugular vein Ioav in the neck, and puncturing it at a place where the flux and reflux of the blood are plainly discernible, there is perceived in the first inspiratory effort made by the animal after the woimd, a pecuhar lapping or gurgling hquid, hissing sound; the na tine of the souu depending partly on the size and the situation of the opening in the vesse . 11 the same time, a fcAV bubbles of air are seen to be mixed with bloo at t e orifice in the vein. The entrance of the air is immediately followed by a struggle, during the deeper inspirations of Avhich, fresh quantities of air gamSPONTANEOUS ENTRY OF AIR. 333 ailmittauce, the entrance of each portion being attended by tlie pecidiar sound above described. On listening now to the action of the heart, a loud chitmmg iioise will be heard, synchronous with the ventricular systole ; and the hand will if applied to the parietes of the chest, feel at the same time a peculiar bubblino-, thrilling, or rasping sensation, occasioned by the air and blood being, as it were, whipped together amongst the columnai carneai and chorda3 tendiiieJB. -Vs the introduction of air continues, the circulation becomes gradually more feeble and languid ; the heart’s action, however, being fully as forcible as natiu-al, if not more so. The animal soon becomes unable to stand ; if placed upon its feet, it rolls over on one side, utters a few plaiiitiv e cries, is convulsed, extrudes the feces and m-ine, and dies. If the thorax be immediately opened, it will be seen that the heart’s action is continuing regularly and forcibly, and that the pulmonic cavities, though filled, do not appear distended beyond their ordinary size. Death occiu’S, as I have shown in a paper on this subject, published in the 158th number of the EdiiiiiivffJi 3Isdiccil (tnd Sui ciwcd Jouj ned, in conseciuence of the air and blood being beaten up together in the right cavities of the heart into a spumous froth, which cannot be propelled through the pulmonary vessels ; hence there is a deficient supply of blood to the brain and neiwous centres, and fatal syncope comes on, attended usually by coimdsions. Lr addition to this the fr-othy mixture in the ventricles has not sufficient resistance to press upon and to close the valves of the heart, and the organ soon comes to a stand-stiff. SpoihTANEotjs Entry of Air into the Veins of Man is attended by two distinct sets of phenomena, one of a local, the other of a constitutional character. Local Phenomena.—These consist of a peculiar somid, produced by the entrance of the air, and of the appearance of bubbles about the wound in the The sound is of a hissing, sucking, gurgling, or lapping character, and vem. never fails to indicate the serious natm-e of the accident that has occuiTed. When once heard, whether in man or in the lower animals, it can never be mistaken. It has fortunately fallen to my lot to hear this sound in the human subject on one occasion oiffy, in a patient who had attempted suicide by cutting his throat. The wounded internal jugular was being raised for the pinpose of having a ligatine passed under it, when a loud hissing and ginghng soimd was heard, and some bubbles of ah appeared about the wound ; the patient became faint, and greatly oppressed in his breathing. The ligature was immediately tightened, the faintness gradually passed oft^ and no bad consequences ensued. ^ The Constitutional Effects are usually very marked. At the moment of the entry of the air, the patient is seized vnth extreme faintness, and a sudden oppression about the chest; he usually screams out or exclaims that he is dead or dying, and continues moaning and whining ; the pulse becomes nearly im- perceptible, and the heart’s action labouring, rapid, and feeble ; death com- monly results, but not instantaneously, in many cases at least. Thus Beau- chesne’s patient lived a quarter of an hour after the occiuTence of the accident; Mirault’s between three and four hours ; and Clemot’s several hours. Amongst the other recorded fatal cases, I have not been able to find any but v; statements as to the length of time during which the patients survived. agueENTBANCE OF AIR INTO VEINS. 334 If the patient survive the immediate effects of the accident, he may probably recover vathont any bad symptoms, as happened in the case to which I have referred as occurring at the University College Hospital, and in an instance recorded by B. Cooper. The presence of the air in the pulmonic capillaries •woxdd appear in some cases to act as an irritant, and to induce fatal pneumonia or bronchitis, as happened to the patients of E-onx and Malgaignc. Cause.—The cause of the spontaneous entry of air into the veins has been very completely investigated and determined by the French Commission. If we open a large vein at the root of a dog’s neck, near the thorax, in which the venous pulse, or flux and reflux of the blood, is perceptible, we shall see that air rushes in at each inspiration—but only at this time—never gaining entry during expiration. This is ovdng to the tendency to the formation of a 'I'acumn Avithin the thorax, more particularly in the pericardium, dm-ing inspiration. This suction action, or “ venous inspu-ation,” is confined to the large A-essels in and near the thoracic cavity, being limited by the collapse of the coats of the veins at a little distance from this. If the veins were rigid tubes, it ivould extend thi’oughout the body ; but as they are not, it ceases Avhere the coats collapse. It is indeed limited to that part of the root of the neck and the axilla where the venous flux and reflux are perceptible ; and the space in which it occins has been termed the “ dangerous region.” But, in certain circum- stances, air may spontaneously gain admission at points beyond this. It is weU known that what is called by the French Surgeons the “ canalisa- tion ” of a vein, or its conversion into a rigid uncollapsiug tube, is the con- dition which is most favoinable to the introduction of air into it. Indeed, except in those situations in Avhich there is a natm-al movement of flnx and reflux of the blood in the veins, this accident cannot occur imless these vessels be canahsed, or, in other words, prevented fr’om collapsing. This canalisation of the vessel may be occasioned in a variety of ways. Either the cut vein may be sini’ounded by indm-ated areolar tissue, Avhich will not allow it to retract upon itself, but keeps it ojjen like the hepatic vems ; or the coats of the vessel may have acquired, as a consequence of inflammation or hypertrophy, such a degree of thickness as to prevent their falling together Avhen divided. Then, again, the principal veins at the root of the neck have, as Berard has pointed out, such intimate connections with the neighboining aponeinotic structmus, that they are constantly kept in a state of tension, so that their sides are held apart Avhen they are cut across. The contractions of the platysma and other muscles of the neck may likewise, as Sir C. Bell has shown, haA'e a similar effect. In removing a tumoin, also, that is situated about the neck, the trac- tion exercised upon its pedicle may, if this contains a vein, cause it to become temporarily canahsed ; and the incomplete section of the A'essel, especially in a transverse direction, must j)revent the approximation of the sides of the incision in it, which will be rendered open and gaping by the retraction of the sur- rounding tissues. This patency of the incision in the vein is apt to be increased by the position that is necessarily given to the head and ai-m, in all operations of any magnitude about the shoulders and neck. Lastly, the introduction of air into a vein will be faA'oined by the vessel being diAuded in the angle ot a Avound, the A'ein being, Avhen the flaps that form the angle are lifted up, made open-mouthed and gaping.CANALISATION OF VEINS. 335 In all cases in which air has gained admittance into the veins dm-ing an operation, these vessels were in one or other of the above-mentioned conditions. Tims, in^Bcanchesne’s case, air was introduced in consequence of incomplete dinsion of the external jugular, immediately above the right subclavian, whilst in a state of tension, during the removal of a portion of the clavicle. In a case that occiuTed to Dupuytren, a large vein connected vith a tumour, and com- municating with the jugular, was cut at the last stroke of the scalpel, whilst the tumour was being forcibly di’ami up. The vein was found to be adherent to the sides of a sulcus, so that it remained gaping when cut. In a case related by Delpech, there was hypertrophy of the axillary vein, causing it to gape like an artery. In Castara’s case there was incomplete section of a vein, Avhich opened into the subscapular whilst the tumour was being raised up. In Roux’s case a vein in the neck was opened, whilst a tumoiu’, which was being removed from that region, was being forcibly raised in order to dissect under it. Ulrick saw the accident occiu- in consequence of the incomplete division of the internal jugidar vein, which was implicated in a tumour in the neck. A similar case happened to Mirault of Angers, the internal jugular being divided to half its extent. A case ocem-red to Warren, in which the air entered by the sub- scapulai’ vein, the coats of which were healthy, but in a state of tension in consequence of the position of the arm ; and another, in which the same accident happened from the division of a small transverse branch of commmii- cation between the external and internal jugular, whilst in a state of tension. Mott, whilst removing a tumoiu' of the parotid gland, opened the facial vein, which was in a state of tension in consequence of the position of the patient’s head, when am was introduced. A case is related by Malgaigme in which this accident happened in consequence of the incomplete section of the external jugular vein, which was enveloped in a tumoiu- that was being removed. B(§gin also relates a case in which ah- entered in consequence of the punctiu-e of the internal jugular vein whilst he was removing a tumour from the neck. These cases, which are all that I have been able to meet with in which the condition of the wounded vein was particularised, show clearly what is the state of the vessel and of the siurounding parts that is most likely to favour the occun-ence of the accident, and consequently what the Siu-geon should particularly guard against in the removal of tiunoiu-s about the neck and shoulders ; viz., incomplete division of the veins, and the enijiloyment of forcible traction on the diseased mass at the moment of using the scalpel. In removing tumours fr-om the neck and shoulder, it is in many cases impossible to avoid drawing them forcibly upwards or forwards, in order to get at their deeper attachments ; but if this be necessary the chest should, for reasons that win immediately be pointed out, be tightly compressed, so that no deep inspi- rations may be made at the moment that the knife is being used, or before a divided or wounded vein can be effectually secured. Preventive Treatment.—In the pre-antesthetic days, the accidental entry of air into a vein during an operation was of more common occurrence than it is now. When a patient ivas under the knife, the respirations were generally shallow and restrained, the breath being held, whilst every now and then there V. S^sping inspiration ; at which moment, if a vein were opened in which the pulse was perceptible, or which was canalised, air must necessarily be336 ENTllANGE OF Alii INTO VEINS. sucked in ; and, as has already been said, in quantity and force proportioned to the depth of the inspiration. In these circumstances, the mode of guarding against the introduction of air into the veins is obvious. The chest and abdomen should he so tightly bandaged with broad flannel rollers or laced napkins, as to preA'ent the deep gasping inspirations, and to keep the breathing as shallow as possible, consistently with the comfort of the patient. I have often found that the entrance of air into the veins of a dog could be aiTested by forcibly compressing the chest of the animal, so as to confine the respiratory movements ; but that, as soon as a deep inspiratory effort was made, the com- pression ha\dng been removed, a rush of air took place into the vessel. If, therefore, during an operation about the root of the neck or summit of the thorax, the chest be bandaged, as here recommended, the Surgeon must be careful not to remove the compression until the operation is completed, and the wound dressed ; for if this precaution be not attended to, the patient will most probably, on the bandage being loosened, make a deep inspiration, and the air may be sucked in at the very moment when all appears safe. These precautions are now rarely necessary, for under anmsthesia the respiration is usually slow, regular, and shallow. But I have retained a description of them partly on historic grounds, and partly because they may be necessary still in certain operations about the root of the neck—as the hgatin-e of the subcla’vian, in which some Surgeons do not employ anesthetics. Curative Treatment.—Different plans have been recommended by Sm- o-eons for the treatment of those cases in which air has ah-eady gained admit- tance into a vein ; but, from the very fatal nature of this accident, it does not appear that much benefit has resulted fr-om any of them : the recovery of the patient, in some of the cases, appearing to be rather due to the quantity of afr that was introduced behxg insufficient to cause death, than to any effort on the part of the Singeon. The two piincipal modes of treatment that have been recommended, consist in the suction of the air from the right auricle, and the employment of compression of the chest. Thus Amussat and Blandin advise us to introduce the pipe of a syringe, a female catheter, or a flexible tube, into the wounded vein, if it be large enough to admit the instrument; and if not, to open the right jugular, and pass it doxvix into the amide, and then to employ suction, so as to empty the heart of the mixtme of blood and air. At the same time that this is being done, we are, say they, to compress the chest as forcibly as possible, so as to squeeze more of the air out of the heart. Magendie and Rochoux advise suction alone ; and Gerdy recommends us to be content with compression of the chest. Warren (of Boston) directs us to have recom-se to Needing in the tempoi'al artery, to tracheotomy, or to stimulants, according to the condition of the patient. The indications that present themselves in the treatment appear to me to be threefold ;— i i • 1 To keep up a due supply of blood to the brain. . , i • 2. To maintain the powers of the heart until the obstruction in the pulmonic capillaries can be overcome or removed. i 3 To remove, if possible, the obstruction in the capillaries of the lungs. We shall now see how far the means already mentioned, viz., suction, com- pression, &c., can fulfil these indications.TREATMENT. 337 Suction Avoulcl no doubt be highly advantageous if we could, by this or any other means, remove the air that has gained access to the heart, and thus pre- vent the pulmonic capillai’ies from being still ftu’ther obstructed. But, putting out of consideration the difficulty of finding the woimded vein; the still oreater difficulty of introducing a suitable tube a sufficient distance into it ; the danger of allowing the ingress of afresh quantity of air, whilst opening the sides of the incision in the vein so as to introduce the tube ; and the risk there would be, if the patient recovered from the effects of the accident, of phlebitis supeiwening ; putting aside all these circumstances, which appear to me to be most serious objections, it becomes a question, according to Amussat, who is one of the strongest advocates of this mode of practice, whether, by suction with a syringe, or even by the mouth, any material quantity of air can be removed. He says that, even when the tube is introduced into the right auricle, much more blood than air is constantly withdrawn. These considera- tions, then, should, I think, make the Surgeon hesitate before having recourse to such a hazardous mode of procedure. The next plan, that of circular compression of the chest, however valuable it may be in preventing the ingress of air, can, when it has once been introduced into the veins, have no effect in removing it from the cfrculatory system. We cannot, by any compression that we may employ, squeeze the air out of the heart. But compression may not only be productive of no positive good, but may even occasion much mischief, by embarrassing stiU further the already weakened respiratory movements, and thus interfering with the due aeration of the small quantity of blood that may yet be traversing the lungs. Bleeding from the temporal artery can by no possibihty be productive of any but an injmious effect, by diminishing the already too small quantity of Mood in the arterial system. Opening the right jugular vein may, perhaps, to a certain extent, be serviceable, by unloading the right cavities of the heart, as John Reid has shown it to be capable of doing ; and it has been recom- mended by Cormack on this accoimt. Lastly, tracheotomy cannot be of any particular service, as the arrest of the respiratory function is secondary, and not primary. 1. What, then, are the measmes that a Surgeon should adopt in order to prevent the occurrence of a fatal termination in those cases in which air has been accidentally introduced into the veins during an operation ? Beyond a doubt, the first thing to be done is to prevent the further ingress of air, by compressing the wounded vein with the finger, and, if j)racticable, securing it by a ligature. At all events, compression with the finger should never be omjttcd ; as it has been shovm by Nysten, Amussat, Magendie, and others, that it is only when the air that is introduced exceeds a certain quantity, that death ensues. All further entiy of air having been thus prevented, oiu* next object should be to Jceep) up a good supply of Mood to the hrain and nervous centres, and thus maintain the integrity of their actions. The most efficient means of accomplishing this would probably be the plan recommended by Mercier ; who, believing that death ensues in these cases, as in prolonged syncope, from a deficient supply of blood to the brain, recommends us to employ compression of the aorta and axillaiy arteries, so as to divert the whole of thejfiood that may be circulating in the arterial system to the encephalon. zENTRANCE OP AIR INTO VEINS. 338 This appears to me to be a very valuable jDiece of advice, and to be the most effectual way of carrying out the indication. The patient should, at the same time that the compression is being exercised on his axillary arteries and aorta, or, if it be prefeiTed, as more convenient* and easier than the last, on his femorals, be placed in a recumbent position as in ordinary fainting, so as to facilitate the afflux of blood to the head. The compression of the axillary and femoral arteries may readily be made by the fingers of two of the assistants who ai’e present at every operation of importance. 2. For the fulfilment of the second indication, that of maintaining the action of the heart until the obstruction in the capillaries of the lungs can be overcome or removed, artificial respiration should be resorted to as the most effectual means of keeping up the action of that organ. For the purpose of keeping up artificial respiration, Silvester’s method is the best, or the Humane Society’s bellows may be used ; or the Sm-geon may iifflate Avith his mouth. Before inflating the lungs, it will be necessary to remove everything that compresses the chest, or interferes in any way vdth the free exercise of the respiratory movements. Friction with the hand over the pra3cordial region, and the stimulus of annnonia to the nostrils, may at the same time be resorted to. 3. The third indication—that of overcoming the obstruction in the pulmonic capillaries—would probably be the best fulfilled by the means adopted for the accomphshment of the second, atz., artificial inflation of the lungs. That the action of respiration, if kept up sufficiently long, mil enable the capillaries of the lungs to get rid of the air contained in them, appears to be a fact; for I have experimentally observed that, if a certain quantity of air be spontaneously introduced into the jugular A'ein of a dog, and artificial respiration be then established, and maintained for half or three-quarters of an hour, a very small quantity indeed, if any, wW\ be found, on killing the animal, in the cavities of the heart, or in the branches of the pulmonary vessels. I am aware that this is not altogether conclusive of the fact, as the air might be dissolved in the blood, or might still exist in the capillaries of the lungs, although none might be found in the larger branches of the pulmonary artery ; but still it seems to me that we can hardly account for the lai’ge quantity of air that will disappear when artificial respiration is kept up, in any other way than that some, if not all of it, passes out of the capiUaiy vessels into the air cells of the lungs.INJURIES OF NERVES. 339 CHAPTEE XVIII. —♦— SPECIAL INJURIES OF NERVES, MUSCLES, AND TENDONS. INJURIES OP NERVES. Contusion.—Neives ai-e often contused ; the injiny producing a tingling sensation at their extremities, and pain at the part struck. These eftects usually pass off in the coiu’se of a few minutes or hours ; but, in certain conditions of the system, more especially in the hysterical temperament, they may last for a considerable period, and even give rise to neuralgia of a very permanent character. In other cases the continuance of the symptoms appears to be less owing to constitutional than to local causes ; apparently bemg due to thicken- ing of the nem-ilemma, causing compression of the nerve, and thus producing a species of neuralgic paralysis of the parts supphed by it, which may become a som-ce of nervous imtation, leading eventually to disease of the brain or spinal cord. Puncture.—If a nerve be punctured, unpleasant consequences sometimes result, more especially in delicate women. Not only does it happen in such subjects, that the part below the puncture becomes the seat of various tingling, shooting, and burning pains, but the neuralgic condition appears to travel upwards along the proximal part of the nervous tnmk. Thus, I have more than once seen a punctm-e of one of the digital branches of the ulnar nerve produce a kind of painful paralysis of its trunk, rendering the arm nearly useless. I have seen the same effects occm- in the median nerve, from so slight a cause as the punctime of the finger by the needle. It occasionally happens in venesection at the bend of the arm, that a branch of the internal cutaneous nerve is pricked with the lancet, and that very persistent neuralgia occurs in consequence. Division.—Primary Effects. When a nerve is completely cut across, paralysis of sensation and motion occurs in aU the parts supplied by it. Consequently, if the integinty of the nerve be essential to life, as of the pneu- mo^astric, death must ensue. When the nerve is partially divided, or bruised as well as severed, as in cases of gun-shot injury, neimalgia in the parts supplied by it, and sometimes at the proximal end, is associated with the paralytic symp- toms. The patient complains of numbness or deadness in the part supplied by it, and all tactile sensibility is lost; but various anomalous painful sensations of a burning, trickling, tingling, or creeping kind are complained of. These sen- sations usually give the idea of increased heat of the part to. the patient, and are compared by him to the effect that would be produced by molten lead or boil- ing water running through it. But the sensation of heat is deceptive, for the part will be found on examination to be actually colder than natural. Thus T z 2340 INJURIES OF NERVES, MUSCLES, AND TENDONS. found in n, woman who was under my care for a wound of the fore-arm, by which the ulnar nerve had been divided, that, twenty-one days after the injury, the tcmperatiu’e between the ring and the little finger of the injured side was 9“ Fahr. below that of the same spot in the opposite hand. The Secondary Effects of division of a nerve consist in various modifica- tions of sensibility, not only in the parts supplied by it, but also in some cases, as in the instance of punctm-e, in the proximal part of the trunk of the injiued nerve above the seat of its division. These effects, consisting of neuralgic pains and sensations of all kinds, and of varying degrees of intensity, from creeping and tingling up to real tic, are always associated vith more or less paralysis, and are doubtless due in a great measiue to the compression of the injured part of the nerve by infiammatory exudations, and the condensation of its sheath by plastic deposits. Besides these effects, the nutrition of the part supplied by the injiued nerve becomes seriously modified. The part becomes congested, bluish, oedematous, and colder than natural. The skin becomes rough and peels, or the seat of vesicular or bulbous eruptions, which are apt to degenerate into sluggish and unhealthy ulcers. The muscles become flabby and wasted ; and ultimately defonuity of various kinds may ensue from the distiu'bance of the proper balance of antagonism between the different sets of muscles of the part. As union gradually takes place between the opposite ends of the divided nerve, the various phenomena that have just been described gradually subside, and complete restoration of the nonnal sensibihty, mobihty, and nutrition of the part eventually takes place. In some important cases, however, this does not happen, and, the nerve about the seat of its division becoming imphcated in a mass of dense cicatricial tissues, a traumatic neiuoma is developed, which, just as in similar conditions in stumps, may become the seat and the source of the most intense sufferings—the neiualgic pains dai-ting hke electrical shocks downwards to the tei-minal branches, and upwards along the tnmk and the secondary divisions of the affected nerve. Repair.—If a cut nerve be examined shortly after the injmy, it will be found to have become shghtly bulbous at the extremity, nervous matter having- escaped fr’om the neurilemma, and fibrine being thrown out around and between the two ends. Restoration of the continuity of the nerve evidently takes place, as is shown by the fact, that in the course of a few months its fmictious o-raduaUy become re-established in its lower part, the paralysis slowly dis- appearing. If, however, a portion of the nerve have been actuaUy excised, there is'^no restoration of function, as was shown long ago by Haighton. Schwann and Hasse have found the return of sensibihty and motion in the lower part of the nerve to be owing to nerve-tubes forming in the muting medium, and thus serving to estabhsh the continuity of the neiwe In the Treatment of a cut nerve, little can be done except to lessen the sufferino-s of the patient; if a sensation of heat be complained of, by t e application of cold ; if the part be too cold, by stimidating embrocations and The ne„;algia resnUmg ft™ the impliyion ft" Mrre by condensed cicatricial tissue has teen ^ "'y’' dissected the nei-ve out of the midst of this, nathont dmdmg or othmuse injuring it.rupture of muscles and tendons. 341 injueies of mubolbsb and tendons. Sprains or Strains of muscuLar parts, without rupture of fibre, arc of very common occurrence, especially about the shoulders, hip, and loins, and arc accompanied by much pain, stiffness, and inability to move the part. When they occur in rheumatic subjects, these injm’ies not uncommonly give nse to severe and persistent symptoms; in some cases painful atrophy, rigidity, or local paralysis of the injured muscle being induced. In the Treatment of these accidents, when recent, it will be found that kneading or rubbing the part with a stimulating embrocation, the application of dry cupping, or, if the pain be severe, the application of hot fomentations mth rest is more efficient. If the injury occur in persons of a rheumatic con- stitution, the effects are much more severe and persistent than in those who are otherwise constituted. In such persons douches, fiictions, and passive motion will, after a time, be necessary, together with proper constitutional treatment. In strumous subjects, a sprahi may lead to the development of very serious inflammations. Muscles that have been sprained sometimes undergo a species of rigid atrophy, Avith much impairment of motion of the limb or joint. In such cases, fiictions, douches, and above aU, electricity, wiU be found useful. Rupture and Division.—Subcutaneous rupture of muscles and tendons not unfi’equently occurs, not so much from any external violence, as from the contraction of the muscle rupturing its own substance. The rupture may occur at one of foiu points: in the muscular substance itself; at the hne of junction between the muscle and tendon; through the tendon ; and, lastly, at the point of insertion of the muscle or tendon into bone. S^dillot foimd that, in 21 cases, the ruptiue occiured at the point of origin of the tendon from the muscle 13 times; and in the remaining 8, the muscle itself was torn. It occasionally happens that the muscular sheath is ruptiued, so that the belly of the muscle forms a kind of hernial protrusion through the aperture ; or the tendon may be displaced by ruptiue of its sheath. This usually happens "with the long head of the biceps, or the extensor tendons of the fingers. These ruj)tures most commonly occur in middle-aged or elderly men, who have lost the elasticity of youth, though their physical strength is miimpaired. At the moment of the rupture, the patient usually experiences a sudden shock, as if he had received a blow, and sometimes hears a snap. He becomes unable to use the injm’ed hmb, and at the part where the rupture has occurred he finds a hollow or pit, produced by the retraction of the ends of the torn muscle, which contracts into a hard lump. These accidents, though troublesome, arc seldom serious. The tendo Achillis, the quadriceps extensor of the thigh, the triceps of the arm, the biceps, the deltoid, the rectus abdominis, are the tendons and muscles that most commonly give way, with the relative frequency of the order in which they are placed. Muscles and tendons may be cut across accidentally or purposely in almost any part of the body. In these injuries there is always a considerable amount of gaping of the wound, owing to the retraction of both ends, if a muscle be divided, and of the upper end only, if a muscle be separated from its tendon or the tendon cut across.342 INJURIES OF NERVES, MUSCLES, AND TENDONS. Union.—The mode of iiiiiou of these injuries has been well described by Paget. When a tendon is cut or torn across, an ill-defined mass of nucleated blastema of a greyish-pink tint is effused into the areolar tissue and sheath, between the cut ends. About the fourth or fifth day this has become more defined and fibrillated, forming a distinct cord-like uniting mass between the ends of the tendon ; in the course of two or three more days, this mass has become tough and filamentous; the tissue gradually perfects itself, until it closely resembles tendinous structm’c, though for some time it remains dull white and more cicatricial in appearance. The strength of this bond of union is maiwellously great; Paget found that the tendo Achilhs of a rabbit, six days after its division, required a Aveight of 20 lbs. to rupture it. In ten days the breaking weight Avas 56 lbs. Dmded muscles unite in the same way as tendons, but less quickly, and by a fibrous cicatricial bond. Treatment.—The principle of treatment in these cases is extremely simple : it consists in relaxing the muscles by position, so as to approximate the divided ends ; and in maintaining the limb in this position for a sufficient length of time for proper union to take place. If muscular relaxation be not attended to, the uniting bond AviU be elongated and weak, and perhaps altogether inefficient. Stiffness and weakness are often left for a length of time—for many months, indeed—after union has taken place ; A'ery commonly, OAving to the consohdation of the dmded tendon to its sheath, and of this to the neigh- bomlng soft structures. Warm sea-water douches, followed by methodical friction, aatIII greatly tend to restore the suppleness of the parts. ATieii the tendo Achillis is ruptured, the best mode of treatment consists in the application of an apparatus formed of a dog-collar placed round the thigh above the knee, from Avhich a cord is attached to a looj) in the back of a shpper; by shortening this cord, the leg is bent on the thigh, and the foot extended, so that the muscles of the calf become completely relaxed. After this simple apparatus has been used for two or three weeks the patient may be allowed to go about, wearing a high-heeled shoe for some Aveeks longer. The Quadriceps Extensor of the Thigh may be torn away from the insertion into the patella, or its tendon may be ruptured about an inch above this. Such an accident occurs in the same Avay that a patella is broken across, namely, by a A'iolent muscular effort to prevent falling whilst the knee is semi-flexed. Under these circumstances one of three things Avill happen ; the tendon of the quadriceps, the pateUa, or the hgamentmn pateUae, will give way. More commonly the patella is broken across ; next the tendon gives way, and least frequently the hgament. When the tendon gives way the signs are uu- mistakeable. The patient falls on the ground, is imable to raise or to stand on the injm-ed limb, the gap occasioned by the retracted mnscle can rarely be felt, and the knee-joint rapidly swells up. _ The Ingamentum PateUE§ is rarely ruptm-ed. MTien it has given Aiay the pateUa is draAin up and a deep gap is left below it. The treatment is the same as in the case of the r up timed tendon. r i The Treatment is that of fractured patella, viz., elevation of the hmb, p- ported on a back sphnt, in the extended position at an angle AAnth the body. This must be continued for scA'eral weeks, AA'hen the patient may e a oaaclaceration of rectus abdominis. 343 about with the joint protected by a knee-cap. In three or foiu* cases of this accident which I have seen, somewhat troublesome stiffness of the parts has long been left. ' ^ In Kupture of the Muscles or Tendons of the Arms or Shoulder support in a sling is all the special treatment needed._ men the mi^cles about the shoulder are the seat of injury, rapid atrophy is apt to ensue, pro- bably owing to the implication of the circumflex and suprascapular nerves, and consequent interference with the nutrition of the part. Fig. 1B6 is a good illustration of the remote effects of such a strain of the capsular muscles of the shoulder-joint. In this case the accident arose from severe dragging upon the ai’m by the reins of a run- away horse. In division of the Extensor Ten- dons of the Fingers—a veiy common accident—the hand must he kept ex- tended in a straight splint for some weeks, until perfect union has taken place. Laceration of the Rectus Ab- dominis Muscle may occur in the efforts of childbirth, or from blows upon the abdominal wall; a ventral hernia being the consequence. Guthrie relates several remarkable cases oc- curring iifr^military practice, of pro- gressive atrophy of a part of the muscular waU of the abdomen following blows.344 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. CHAPTEK XIX. INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. INJUEIES OP BONES. A BO¥E may be bruised, bent, cut, or fractured. Bruising of the Bone and Periosteum often occm’s, and is usually ot no great moment. A moderate contusion, however, of a bone that is but thinly covered, as the shin or elbow, may give rise to troublesome symptoms from inflammation of the periosteum. If the contusion be severe, the vitality of a layer, or even of the whole substance of the bone, may be destroyed, as happens sometimes from the graae or contusion of a bullet; or the bone may become deeply inflamed, and suppuration take place in its cancellous structure. In old people, the contusion of a bone is frequently followed by atrophy and shortening, as happens in the neck of the femm’; in strumous constitu- tions, it may lead to serious disease of the bone, ending in its complete diBorganisation. In the Treatment of bruised bone, leeches and fomentations are the most important means that we possess. The consequences 'will be considered when we come to speak of necrosis. Bending of Bone may occur in two conditions, viz.: without or with fracture. Bending without fracture is most commonly met with in very young subjects, before the completion of ossiflcation ; the bone being healthy, but naturally soft, at this period of hfe. It occasionally takes place in adidt life, but is then the result of some structm’al change, by which the natmal firmness of the osseous tissue is diminished. The bending most commonly occurs in the long or slender bones, especially the clavicle, the radius, and the femur, but sometimes is met with in the flat bones, or those of the skuU, in which depression takes place from a blow without fracture having occurred. In many cases of bending both of long and of flat bones, there is partial fractm’e on the convex side—the “ green-stick fractime ” (see page 354). The Treatment is simple : the Sm-geon gradually straightens the bone, by applying a splint on its concave side, towards which the bone is pressed by a bandage and a pad applied upon its greatest convexity. Fractures will be described in the following two chapters. INJUEIES OF JOINTS. Contusions.—Joints are often contused by kicks, falls, or blows, so as to be severely injiu-ed, giving rise to much pain, and consecutive inflammation of the capsule, synovial membrane, or other structures entering into their forma- tion. As a result of contusion the joint may be suddenly distended withSPRAINS. 345 blood, Mmarthrosis. The blood so effused undergoes absorption after a time, without leading to any inconvenience. The Treatment should be actively anti-inflammatory, nuth complete rest of the part. In a later stage, an elastic bandage, cold douches, and friction, are useful. In some cases the bnrsa, situated in the neighbourhood of a joint, is seriously bruised, and becomes inflamed: in consequence, there are often troublesome suppuration and some sloughing. When this takes place, free incision into the inflamed part, in addition to the ordinai-y anti-inflammatory treatment, will afford speedy and effectual relief to the patient. Spraixs.—When a joint is tivisted violently so that its ligaments are either much stretched or partially torn, though there be no displacement of the osseous siu’face, it is said to be sprained. These injuries are exceedingly painful and troublesome in their consequences. They most frequently occm’ to the wrists and ankle-joints. The pain is very severe, and often sickening ; and the sprain is rapidly followed by swelling and inflammation of the joint and investing tissues, often very chronic and tedious. As the inflammation subsides, stiffness and pain in using the part continue for a considerable length of time, and are in some cases followed by a kind of rigidity and wasting of the limb. In individuals of a rheumatic or gouty habit of body, the inflamma- tion of the joint consequent on the sprain is often most tedious and chronic, and wiU only yield to appropriate constitutional treatment; and occasionally in strumous subjects, destructive disease of the joint is induced. Treatment.—If the sprain be slight, rubbing the part with a stimulating- embrocation, and giving it the support of strapping or a bandage, are aU that need be done. But if it be at all severe, more active measures must be had recourse to. These must vary according to the condition of the joint when the Surgeon sees the patient ; but they are aU conducted on the principles of securing perfect rest, and subduing inflammatory action. If the Surgeon see the patient immediately on the occurrence of the accident, or before swelling to any great extent has occiuTed, the best plan is to strap up the joint very fli-mly -with long strips of plaster, over which a starched bandage may be apphed. This method of treatment, which comprises rest, perfect immobihty, and compression of the joint, puts it into the best possible condition for the repair of the injured articular structm-es, and for the prevention of consecutive inflammation. Should inflammation with much swelling have set in, this must be subdued by keeping the joint for several hours in cold water, or well moistened with an evaporating lotion, or wet by means of irrigation or covered vith ice-bags. Should this not check the inflammation, leeches may be freely apphed : and, when the swelling has somewhat subsided, the joint should be supported vhth an elastic roller and plasters, a starched bandage, or leather splints. In the more advanced stages, when pain and stiffness alone are left, it should be well douched -with cold water twice a day, and afterwai’ds rubbed or kneaded with soap-liiiimeut, until its usual strength and mobility are restored. This, however, very commonly does not occm- in sprains of the knee and ankle for many weeks ; a degree of stiffness, combined Avith inflam- mation, being left until the stretched and lacerated ligaments have regained their normal condition. Wounds of Joints.—A joint is known to be wounded when synovia346 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. escapes from the aperture, or when the interior of the articulation is ex- posed. If there be any doubt as to the wound haring penetrated the synovial membrane, no attempt should be made to ascertain this by pro- bing or otherwise, as in this way the very occuiTence that is to be dreaded may be induced by the Surgeon. The question of the wound having pene- trated into the interior of the joint viU speedily be cleared up by the symptoms that supervene. Symptoms and Effects.—The severity of the wound of a joint depends not only on the size of the articulation, but on the nature of the Avound, and the age and health of the patient. Surgical Avounds of joints for the pmpose of removing loose cartilages may usually be made with perfect safety, if proper precautions be taken to prevent the intrusion of air. So also there are many cases on record in which joints have been opened for the removal of foreign bodies—as needles—and perfectly moA^able articulations left. But Avith joints laid open as the result of accidents, the consequences are usually not so faA'ourable. This may be OAving to many causes, such not only as the free admission of air, but also of dirt and foreign bodies likely to excite inflammation. When a small joint, as that of one of the fingers, is opened, the injmy may often be recovered from, Avithout destruction of the articulation. When a large joint is opened, even by a small incised or punctm’ed wound, there is great danger lest such extensive local mischief and constitutional distmbance should ensue as to lead to the destruction of the articulation, Avith danger to the patient’s life. When the wound is large, lacerated, or contused, Avith fr'actiu’e of the articular ends of the bones, one or other of these consequences will certainly folloAV. It is especially in adults that these unfavourable results ensue : in children, extensfre injuries of large joints may heal favoiuably ; though, if the child be of a striunous habit, destructive action is apt to be set up. Traumatic Arthritis.—The som’ce of danger in a wounded joint is the inflammation set up in the articulation. A fcAA' hours after the urfliction of the injmy the joint swells, becomes hot and painful, and throbs. If, imder proper treatment, resolution be effected, these inflammatory symptoms Avill gradually subside, leaAung the articulation Aveak, tender, and stiff for some considerable time. Should, however, the inflammation continue, the pain increases, becom- ing tensive and excessively severe. If the apertm-e be large, synoAua fr-eely escapes) which soon becomes mixed Avith inflammatory products. If it be small, little more than a punctiue, the joint swells, and fills Avith pm-iflent fluid, which AviU either escape through the original wound, or find an outlet for itself through a new opening. There are startings in the limb, which is flexed, Avith excessive pain in any attempt at moving it. The co^titutiou distmbance becomes very severe, the patient being occasionally carried off by tne violence of the initative fever. In other cases symptoms of piuulent absorp- tion come on, and death results from pyaimia. If the patient em-yive this period of aente action, ntaoesses may form armmd and above the ai’ticnlation ; and the discharge fiom these, as ne as y ® joint, induces irritative fever and hectic. Should this danger lie passe 'OUj, ,347 TEAUAfATIG ARTHRITIS. and the patient eventually survive, it will be with a partially ankylosed limb, the utility of which is greatly impaired. _ The severity of the symptoms in the wound of a large joint is evidently dependent on the extent and depth of the synovial membrane which suppurates, wounds of ginglymoid being hence more dangerous than those of orbicular joints ; amfoiUhe retention of the pus thus formed, or its imperfect exit from the midst of the tense and unyielding tissues. The admission of air into the joint is of itself a great source of danger, though not necessarily of destructive disor<>'anisation. Its danger is well shown by the fact that, in the most ex- tensive subcutaneous wounds and larcerations of joints, such as occiu’ in dis- locations and simple fr'actures in which the capsule is widely torn, the h'gaments ruptiu’ed, the incrusting cartilages and synoAial membrane broken through, and the interior of the joint filled with blood, suppimation never takes place, but the lacerated joint-structures heal kindly and well in a few weeks, leading the articulation almost unimpaired in its movements. The presence of air appears to exercise an injurious influence upon the pus collected in the depths of the joint, causing it to become putrescent and acrid, and thus greatly in- creasing the local irritation. It is this retention of acrid and putrescent pus, in contact with a large inflamed surface, that gives rise to ataxic fever and pyaemia, which so fr’equently prove fatal in these injinies. Of aU wounds of joints, gun-shot injinies are necessarily the worst. In these, the aperture camiot possibly be closed and miited by the first intention ; it and the track of the ball must suppurate. The bones are also usually splintered, and foreign bodies of various kinds are introduced into the articulation ; hence the most extensive disorganising and fatal mischief commonly ensues. Traumatic arthritis differs fr’om the destructive and disorganising idiopathic inflammations of joints in this : that, when the inflammation occurs as the result of a wound, the synovial membrane is the part primarily affected ; if the cartilages become involved, they are so secondarily ; the articular ends of the bones not participating in the morbid action. When a joint is the seat of disorganising inflammation of an idiopathic character, the mischief usually commences in the osseous articular ends, or in the cartilage, the synovial membrane being often the last affected. In the traumatic form, the disease may be said to radiate from the centre of the joint; in the idiopathic, to pro- ceed from the circumference. In recent cases of traumatic arthritis we find the synovial membrane lustreless, swollen, tufted, infiltrated, gelatinous in appearance, of a crimson coloiu, and covered with lymph ; the contiguous or subjacent portions of car- tilage are softened and partially eroded. Under the microscope, a disruption oi^ the cartilage-cells may be observed, and the intervening substance is granular ; these changes gradually cease in deeper sections of the cartilage, which wiU be found to present a healthy appearance. In the more advanced stages of the disease, when the joint has been suppurating perhaps for months, it will be found that the synovial membrane is deeply Auscular in places, in other parts pulpy and infiltrated with, or replaced by, greyish or yeUoAnsh plastic matter. The cartilages are eroded in patches exposing the rough and injected smTaces of the articular extremity of the bone ; where not eroded, they are pulpy and disorganised. Occasionally partial but misuccessful348 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. attempts at bony union will have been set np between the opposite exposed osseous siu’faces. In the Treatment of Wounded Joints, the fii’st point to be determined must be whether amputation or resection should be performed, or an attempt made to save the injured joint. If the joint be small, and the disorgam'sation of bones or soft parts not very great, there can be no doubt that we ought to attempt, and shall usually be able, to save it. But if it be of one of the larger ai’ticulations, the line of practice must be determined by the extent of the injmy, and the age and constitution of the patient. If the wound be but small and clean cut, no Surgeon would be justified in having recom*se to immediate amputation, even though it be the knee that is injm’ed. But if the joint have been extensively laid open, mth much contusion and laceration, com- plicated perhaps mth dislocation, or with fracture and splintering of the bones, the case is different. In these unfavoiu’able circumstances, however, in the upper extremity, and even in the ankle, the limb may not unfrequently be saved. If the bones be comminuted, the removal of spfinters and resection of the articular ends may advantageously be practised in many cases, more par- ticularly if the patient be young and sound in constitution, and the soft parts not too extensively damaged. But if these be largely lacerated and widely contused, and the patient aged or broken in health, amputation is imperatively called for. This is more especially the case when the knee is injm'ed ; exten- sive lacerations of this joint, more particularly when complicated Awth disloca- tion or comminution of the bones, being cases for early amputation. If it be determined to make an attempt at saving the joint, the principal point is, if possible, to close the woimd by the first intention, and thus to pre- vent suppiu’ation. With this view the antiseptic method has been employed Avith excellent results, even in cases of severely wounded joint. After remoAing foreign, bodies, splinters, &c., the Avounded articulations must be well washed out Avith carbohe acid lotion (1 to 40), and the dressings apphed Avith minute attention to detail, as described at p. 200. Should antiseptics not be used, the folloAving treatment should be adopted. If the joint be opened by a punctine, or small clean-cut wound, this may occasionally be closed by bringing the edges 'together, and placing a piece of lint soaked in collodion upon it, or a strip of plaster washed over AAuth resm varnish. The joint must then- be placed in a sphnt (plaster of Paris is the best), so as to be rendered absolutely immovable, and should then be sur- roimded by India-rubber bags containing pomaded ice. In fact, the tln-ee great principles of treatment in the early stages of wounds of joints consist in the exclusion of air, perfect rest, and the continuous appheahon of diy co . In this wayinfiammatory action maybe prevented, and the muon of the wound may take place under the plaster ; but in the majority of cases the Wimy is followed by so abundant a secretion of synovia, that the di'essing becomes loosened by the tension and outAvard pressine of the acciunulated fluid Avhich escapes from under it. If the preventive means of arresting and the joint sweU, becoming red, hot, and throbbing, with much constiti t . best done by the free application of leeches over the .loiiit, hot fomentat ons, and the intLal administration of calomel and opium about lorn times in theWOUFDS OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. 349 day Tliis remedy possesses a more decidedly controlling influence over traiunatic arthritis than any other wth which I am acquainted. TMien suppuration has come on, long and free incisions should be made into the joint so as to procure an early outlet for the pus ; the part must be well poulticed, and an attempt made to procure ankylosis by the granulation and cohesion, through fibrous tissue, of the articular surfaces. Puncturing the joint is worse tluiii useless. By a puncture, the pus cannot be evacuated from, a deep and complicated joint, but air is admitted, and the result is decompo- sition of secretions, with imtative fever and pyaemia ; but, by making fr’ee and early incisions, the dangers resulting from decomposition of the pus and its absoi’ption into the system are in a great measure lessened, and the constitu- tional irritation produced by the tension of the parts is at once removed. The joint itself is not put into a worse condition by being more fr’cely opened ; foi, when once suppuration has been set up in it, even to a limited extent, destruc- tion of its tissues must ensue ; and the patient may recover with a stiff joint, or amputation may become imperative, or he may die from constitutional irritation. The most favourable result that can be anticipated, therefore, is a stiff joint, and this the Sm-geon should endeavoim to obtain. If the case pro- ceed favourably, the discharge will gradually lessen, and the constitutional disturbance subside. The joint must then be placed in such a position, that, when ankylosis results, the hmb may be serviceable to the patient. If, how- ever, as very frequently happens when the larger joints are wounded, the suppuration within the articulation, and the abscesses that form outside it, reduce the patient to a hectic state, secondary amputation speedily becomes inevitable. Wounds of Individual Joints.—To the preceding general principles I have httle to add with respect to wounds of the individual joints. The Hip and Shoulder are so deeply placed, and so well protected, that they can scarcely be wounded except as the result of gun-shot injmy, the ti’eatment of which condition has already been discussed (pp. 236, 237). Wound of the Knee-joint is one of the most common and most severe of such injmies. TiTien the result of gun-shot violence, it imperatively demands immediate amputation. When produced by a punctoe or clean cut, the wound must be closed, and ice and antiseptics employed assiduously. Should suppuration occur, the joint must be freely laid open by long incisions, and commonly amputation will be required. The abscess wifi often form deeply in the thigh rather than in the joint itself; and in a very insidious manner. The limb swells up to the trochanters, becomes very tense, painftd, hot, and cedematous, -with great constitutional distmbance and imtative fever. But the joint may be but little swollen, and many days will often elapse before fluctua- tion can be felt in it or in the thigh. It is this absence of swelling in the knee itself that may mislead an inexperienced practitioner. At length the abscess may approach the surface near the knee ; and, on an incision being- made, an immense quantity of pus is discharged. The abscess forms as a consequence of the escape of some of the in-itating contents of the suppurating synovial membrane, close upon the anterior surface of the femur ; it creeps up and sun-ounds the bone under the deep muscles of the limb, which are separated ft-om the bone, and may reach as high as the trochanters before it is detected.35° INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. Tt is this depth in the limb at which the abscess is seated that gives rise to the difficulty in its detection, the violent constitutional distuihances it occasions, and its extreme danger. I have never seen abscess fomi amongst the muscles of the leg as a consequence of injuries of the knee-joint, unless the tibia had been fractm-ed as well as the joint opened. For the penetration of the knee-joint by needles, see p. 217. Woimds of the Elbow and Ankle-joints, when simple, as in punctures, usually admit of closure and of being healed, leaving a sufficiently useful and mobile articulation. When they are complicated with fractiwe of the neigh- bouring bones, the soft parts not being too extensively injured, resection of the injured articulations is the proper coiu'se to adopt, followed by antiseptic di’essings and good drainage ; if there be much laceration of soft parts with comminution of the bones, amputation, especially in the case of the ankle, will be reqm'red. Wounds of the Wrist-joint are peculiarly dangerous, on account of the extent and complexity of the synovial membrane that enters into its confor- mation. Should suppiu’ation be set up, some of the cai-pal bones may necrose, and thus amputation may be rendered imperative ; or, if this be averted, a stiff and comparatively useless hand will be left. Dislocations will be described in Chapter XXII.CAUSES OF FRACTURE. 351 CHAPTER XX. FRACTURES. The manag-ement of Fractures constitutes one of the commonest duties of the Surgeon, and hence the consideration of all that relates to their nature and treatment is of the utmost importance. A fi-acture may be defined as a sudden and violent solution of continuity in a bone; but by the term fracture it is convenient to describe other lesions, which, strictly speaking, are not comprised in the definition. The displace- ment of an epiphysis from the shaft of a bone is not really a fracture but a separation; as is also the displacement of a costal cartilage from a rib. CausEvS.—Fractures are almost invariably the result of local causes, but the liabihty to their occurrence is more or less modified by certain predisposing circumstances. Local Causes.—Fractures may occur fr’om the application of external violence, or from muscular action. External violence may be applied in two ways : directly or indfr-ectly. The worst forms of fractiue are occasioned by direct external violence, the blow crushing and splintering the bone, as by the passage of a hea’vy wheel or a gun-shot injiuy. When the bone is broken by direct violence, the fr’acture is always at the seat of injm-y, and is often complicated with considerable mis- chief to the soft parts, the result of the same force that breaks the bone. Indirect violence may break a bone in two ways. One that is more com- monly talked of than seen is by contrecoup, in which, when a blow is inflicted on one part, the shock that is communicated expends its violence on the opposite point, where the fractiue consequently occius. This form of injury is chiefly met with in the head ; and, although its occurrence has been denied, I cannot doubt it, as I have seen unequivocal instances. In the next form of indirect violence occasioning fr-actiue, the bone is broken by being snapped, as it ivere, between a resisting medium on one side, and the weight of the body on the other. Thus, a person jiunping fr’om a height and alighting on his feet, may break his legs by their being compressed between the weight of the body above and the ground below. The long bones are those which are most frequently fractm-ed in this ivay; and the fr-actiue occurs at the greatest convexity, of at their weakest point. When a person jumps from a carriage that is in motion, although the height of the fall be not great, yet its foree is considerable, the feet coming violently to the ground, while the body moves with the same velocity as that with which it was being earried onwards in the vehicle. Hence, fractiues received in this way are usually severe, and often compound or comminuted. Muscular action is not an imfrcquent cause of fracture of those bones intoFRACTURES. 352 which powerful muscles arc inserted. This is especially the case with the patella and some of the bony prominences, such as the acromion, which are broken in the same way that a tendon is ruptured—^by the violent contraction of the muscles attached to them tearing them asimder. It is not often that the long bones are so fractured ; but the hmnerus has been broken by a person striking at but not hitting another, or by suddenly thro^ving out the arm to seize some- thing that was faUing ; and the clavicle has been firactured by a rider giving his horse a back-handed blow. In these cases, however, muscular action may not have been the sole cause, the weight of the limb also tending to fractm-e the bone. Those bones that do not afford attachment to any powerful muscles, as the cranial, for instance, caimot be fractured in this way. Predisposing Causes.—These are numerous and varied. Some bones are especially liable to be broken in consequence of their servimj as 'points of supyport. Thus, when a person falls upon the hand, the shock is transmitted fr-om the wrist-joint through the radius, humerus, and cla-vdcle, to the trunk; the radius and clavicle, being the weaker bones, are then espe- cially liable to be fr-actm-ed. So again, the situation of a bone, irrespectively of any other cu’cumstance, may predispose it to fracture ; the prominent posi- tion of the nasal bones, and the exposed situation of the acromion, render these parts peculiarly hable to this injury. The shape of some bones disposes them to fr’actm’e ; thus, a long bone is necessarily more readily broken than a short and thick one ; hence fractures of the tibia and femur from falls on the feet are more common than of the os calcis. Certain parts of lone are more commonly fractm-ed than others. Those parts especially into which powerful muscles are inserted, or that are in exposed situations, and hence liable to injury, or have to receive the weight of the fallen body, are often broken. Hence the acromion, the olecranon, and the neck of the femur, are commonly fractured. Age exercises considerable influence, not only on the general occmrence of fr-acture, but on the peculiar habihty of certain bones. Though fractines may occur at aU ages, even in intra-uterine life (Chaussier has dissected a foetus that had 113 fractines), yet bone, being elastic and cartilaginous in early age, is less readily broken than when it has become brittle and earthy, as in advanced life. In children, fractures most commonly occin at the point of junc- tion between the shaft and epiphysis, where ossification has not as yet become perfect. This separation of the epiphysis in children, the detachment as it were of the terminal points of ossification, occm’s chiefly at the lower ends of the humerus and femin, sometimes in the radius and other long bones. As ap advances, the compact tissue of the shaft becomes denser and harder, the cancellous structine of the extremities more dilated and looser; hence fr-actm-e of the neck of the femur is especiaUy common in old people. In yoimg persons also, the bone is usnally simply broken tonsTeisely, but at a more adranccd period of life are generally oblique, and often comminuted, in adults they also more commonly extend into jomts than when oecmim^ i early age. From statistical tables , “L cr , o Flowei? it appears that below fire years of age the liability of the " fracture is equal. After five, the males steadily increase m habihty iq to middle life. After forty-five, the number of fractures m females exceeds thatVARIETIES OF FRACTURE. 353 in males, in consequence of the extreme frequency of fracture of the lower end of the radius in women above middle life. In children, more than one halt the fractures occurring in the upper limb are of the clavicle. Fi-acture termed Spontaneous sometimes happens without any very direct cause, or under the influence of violence that would usually be insuflicient to occasion it. This may happen in consequence of the texture of the bone being weakened or rendered brittle by disease, such as mollities or fragllitas ossiiun, by the cancerous cachexy, by syphilis, by cancerous gi'owths vdthin the sub- stance of the bone, or by the pressiu-e of some neighboiming tumour causing absorption. In other cases, again, it occurs vuthout any apparent disease, local or constitutional. This usually happens as the result of the brittleness and weakening induced by age. I have knovui a gentleman little above fifty, appai-entlyin perfect health, break his thigh with a loud snap Avhilst tiuning in bed. In these cases union rarely takes place, or not without much difficulty. But spontaneous fractimc of the femur has more than once been met mth in young men apparently quite healthy, from the sudden and ffiolent contraction of the thigh muscles, as for instance in pulling off or drawing on a boot. As a rule, union readily takes place. Sex indirectly influences the liabihty to fr'acture, men-being more fre- quently exposed to the causes of this injury than women. In women, the bones that are most commonly fractured are the clavicle, the tibia, and the neck of the femur ; in men, the shafts of the long bones, the cranium, and the pelvis. From statistical accounts it would appear that the right limbs are more frequently broken than the left, being more exposed to violence. The suppo- sition that the bones are more brittle in winter, and hence break more readily than at other seasons, is altogether a mistake ; though fi’actures may be common at this period of the year, fi’om falls being more fi’equent. Varieties.—Fractures present important varieties as to their Nature and their Direction. The varieties as to nature depend upon the cause of the frac- tiue, its seat, and the age of the patient. Nature.—Fractimes are dimded into two great classes, according as they are unaccompanied or attended by an open wound leading down to the line of breakage in the bone—the first being called Simple, the second Gonypoimd. In the first class are included the Simple Fracture, where the bone is merely broken across, split, or fissured ; the Impacted, where one fragment is wedged into another, the compact tissue being driven into the cancellous structime ; the Comminuted, where the bone is broken into several fr-agments ; and the Multiple, where there are more fractiues than one. iWhen the soft parts are torn through, so that the fractm-e communicates by a wound with the surface of the body, it is said to be Compound. A fi’acture may be rendered compound in two ways ; cither thi'ough laceration of the soft parts by the same injury that breaks the bone, as when a bullet in traversing a limb, fractures the bone ; or else by the protrusion of one of the extremi- ties of the broken fragments through the integiunents. This necessarily most frequently happens when the fragments are sharp and pointed, and the coi’cr- ings thin, as in fractine of the tibia, and may be occasioned by muscular con- traction, or by some incautious movement on the part of the patient, driving the fragment through the skin. VOL. I. A AFRAC TUBES. 354 It is important to distinguish between fi’acturcs that are primarily eompoiuid, that is, tliat are compound from the fii’st or become so within a few days, and those in which a wound leading to the broken bone forms some time after the accident, as the result of iuflamniation, suppuration, and sloughing, or from other causes. A\Tien the fracture becomes compound secondarily, the danger is greatly lessened, on account of the reparative tissue that has formed at the broken ends of the bones closing up the medullary aTid Haversian canals, and by that means diminishing tbe risks of severe inflammation of the bone, pymmia, and the absorption of septic matters. A fi-actiu’e is said to be Complicated when the injury to tbe bone is con- joined ■with other conditions which are perhaps of more importance than the mere fractiu’e, the complication constituting often the most serious part of the injiuy, and influencing greatly the general result of the case. Thus, a fracture may be complicated with injiuy of an important internal organ, as of the brain, lungs, or bladder ; the injiuy to the organ being inflicted by the pro- jection against it of one of the broken fragments. A fractine is not luifre- quently compheated vith the wound of one of the principal arteries of the part, as happens especially in the leg, where the tibial arteries, being in close contact with the bone, are often tom by the broken ends. In other cases, again, the fractiu-e is associated vith injmy of a joint or ivith dislocation. Besides these varieties of fi'actiu-e, it occasionally happens that a bone is only cracked, or paiiiaUy broken. This especially occurs in the bending of bone in children, ui which cases the fracture may be Partial or Incomplete, merely extending across the convexity of the ciuve made by the bone. This is some- ■ times called the “ fjreen-stich” fr'actime. Direction.—The direction assumed by fr’actmes varies greatly, and de- pends materially on the cause of the injiuy, as well as upon the bone that is fr’actimed. The line of fr'acture may riui through a bone in three different dhections : eithei' trcciisvcrscly, oiliyuely, or lonyitudinally to its axis. The Trans'verse Fracture is the simplest, and is seldom compheated u ith injiuy to the neighboining parts. It chiefly occins in children, and very fr’e- quently between the articular extremity and the shaft of a bone ; it imites readily, and is attended by but little displacement. It is most commonly the result of direct violence, but it may arise from muscular action, as in the case of the patella, which is usually broken in this way. The Oblique Fracture commoidy occurs from indirect violence ; the break- ino- force being applied to the ends, and not across the shaft. It often rims a lono- way, more than half the distance of the shaft of a bone, and is more daimerous than the transverse, owing to the obliquity of the fr-acture causing the ends of the bone to be sharply pointed (Fig. 137, a), and thus fr-equently to punctiu-e the skin, or to perforate an artery. It is more tedious in its cure than the transverse, omng to the extent of surface over which Piocess ot repair has to be earned on, and the difficulty of keeping the fragment chjtly in apposition ; hence, also, there is a greater liability to ^ limb. It is principally met with in the shafts of the long bones of adults and fl’he Longitudinal Fracture consists of a splitting or fissuring of a boneSTGiVS OF FRACTURE. 355 Fig. 137.—Oblique and Longitudi- nal Fractures. ill the direction of its axis (Fig. 137, V). Longitudinal fracture, or splitting of bone, is not very common in civil practice; but in military practice it is frequent, especially from the action of conical rifle-balls. In such cases, when the shaft is struck and shattered, the splitting of the bone may extend widely in either direction —sometimes into the neighbouring joint (Fig. 85, p. 221), although, as Stromeycr has remarked, it usually stops short of this, terminating at the epiphysis. When the fractiu’e is produced by a blow, which need not be a very severe one, upon the articular end, the bone may be split and the joint opened. The Separation of the Epiphysis of one of the long bones from the shaft, at the line of junction, is an accident that occasionally ocems in childi’en and young people at any period up to that of the completion of the ossification between the parts. Hence it is usually met with mider the age of 21 or 22. This kind of fractiu-e is always transverse. It is apt to simulate a dislocation very closely ; but the diagnosis may be made by finding that the articulation is always intact, and its movements usually free. Union ]jy bone readily takes place. Hot only are the epiphyses of the long bones liable to this separation through the fine of junction, but the same thing may happen to various pro- cesses, as the acromion, olecranon, &c. ; and some osseous structures, as the acetabulum and sternum, are apt under external Uolence to separate into their original component parts. Signs.—Fractm-e may produce pain, and alteration of the bidk of the limb; these may be due either to the laceration of the soft parts by the broken fragments, or to the general injury inflicted upon it. Increase of size is observed in some cases of fr'actiu’e ; the augmented size being due either to the extravasation of blood mto the limb, which often takes place to a very considerable extent, even without the wound of any principal vessel; or to the approximation of the attachments of the muscles by the shortening of the limb. Diminished bulk, or flattening, occims in some cases, in consequence of the weight of the limb drawing the part dovm, and thus lessening natm’al rotundity. Neither pain nor alteration of bulk can be regarded as pathognomonic of fr’actiu'e. The more special and peculiar signs of fr-actm-e are three : 1. A Change in the Shape of the Limb ; 2. Mobility in its Continuity ; and 3. The existence of Grating between the Broken Ends of the Bone. ^1. The Change in the Shape of the Limb, due to the displacement of portions of the broken bone, is perhaps the most important sign of Jfractiu’e ; Jt mam'fests itself by a want of correspondence between the osseous points on opposite sides of the body, by an increase or diminution of the natiu'al curves of the limb, by angidarity, shortening, or swelling. In investigating the existence and extent- of displacement in a case of frac- ture, the Sm’geon should always strip his patient, and compare the correspond- ing points of bone on the opposite sides of the body, and their relative situation to some fixed and easily distinguishable neighbouring prominence on the trunk or injured part of the limb. From this the mcasiu-emcnts may be taken, by A A 2 \FRACTURES. 356 grasping the injured part and the corresponding portion of the healthy limb in each hand, and running the fingers lightly over the depressions and elevations, mai’king any difference that exists ; or, if greater accuracy be required, measiuing by means of a tape. In some cases the measurement must not be made between the trunk and the limb injured, or even from one extremity of the hmb to the other, as shortening of the whole member might depend on other causes than fracture, such as wasting, disease of joints, or dislocation ; when this is the case, the measiu’ement must be taken between different points of the bone injured, and compared mth a similar measurement of the sound limb. The displacement of a broken bone may be the direct result of the •\dolence which occasions the fractui’e, the fragments being driven ont of their position, as when a portion of the skuU is beaten in ; or it may result from the weight of the limb dragging downwards the lower fragment, as in a case of fractm-ed acromion. In some cases it is either occasioned or greatly increased by the direction of the fr’actiue. Thus, in several cases of broken tibia which have been under my care, the fine of fracture being obhque from above downwards, and from before backwards, I have found the upper end of the lower fr’agment project considerably forwards, sliding, as it were, along an inchned plane in the upper fragment; and in one of these cases, which I had an opportunity of dis- secting after amputation, the duection of the fracture, rather than muscular action, appeared to be the cause of displacement. In transverse fr’actiues there is always but shght displacement. Muscular contraction is, however, mthout donbt the most active cause of displacement : hence it has been found that, in paralysed lunbs which are fractm-ed, there is but little defoimity. The contraction of the muscles of the part approximating their pouits of attachment, owing to the support or resistance offered by the bone being removed, draws the most movable frag- ment out of its normal position. The other causes that have just been mentioned, tend greatly to favour this kind of displacement; but in some cases, as in fr-actiued patella, the displacement is entirely muscular, and in all fr-actm-es of the long bones it is chiefly due to muscular contraction. The Direction of the Displacement is principally influenced by the direc- tion of the fr-actiue, the position of the limb, and muscular action ; it may be angular, transverse, longitudinal, or rotatory. In the angular displacement there is an increase of the natmal ciuvatiue of the hmb, the concavity of the angle being on the side of the most powerful muscles ; thus, for example, in fractiue of the thigh, the angle projects on the anterior and outer side of the hmb, because the strongest mnscles, being- situated behind and to the inner side, tend, by their contraction, to approxi- mate the fragments on that aspect. This displacement principally occius in obhque and comminuted fractures. The transverse or lateral displacement occius when_ a bone is broken directly across, the fr-agments often hitching one against another, and so being, as it were, entangled together. In this case there is often but veiy httle deformity. In the longitudinal displacement there may be either shortening or elonga- tion of the hmb. When there is shortening, as most commonly happens in obhque fr-actures, it is dependent on muscultu contraction, the broken cn s357 SIGNS OF FRACTURE. of bone being brought together so as to overlap one another, or on “riding,” In other cases, the shortening may be owing to the impaction of one fragment iji the other. In some cases there is preternatural separation of the fragments, the weight of the limb tending to drag the lower one dovmwards, or muscular contraction ch'aAving the upper one away fi’om it. The rotatm-y displacement is ovang to the contraction of particular sets of muscles twisting the lower fragment on its axis, as weU as producing shortening of the limb. Thus, the external rotators in intracapsular fractures of the neck of the thigh-bone, and the supinators in some fractures of the radius, have a tendency to twist or rotate the lower fragment in an outward direction. 2. The occuiTcnce of Preternatural Mobility in the Continuity of a bone camiot exist without fractm-e, and separation of the fragments from one another ; hence, its presence may always be looked upon as an unequivocal sign of broken bone. But fr-actiue may exist without it; thus, it occasionally happens that fractiue takes place, and, owing to the impaction or wedging together of the fraguients, mobility is not perceived. 3. ilnother sign of much value in practice is the occurrence of Crepitus, or rather of the Grating together of the Rough Surfaces of the Broken Bone, which can be felt as well as heard on moving the limb. This grating can only occur when the fragments are movable and in contact, and is especially perceptible when the rough ends of the broken bone are directly rubbed against one another. It is not, however, an invariable accompaniment of fractiue ; being absent in some cases, in which the fracture is firmly impacted, or when the fragments are widely separated. It must not be con- founded with the crepitation that occurs in the limbs from other causes, as fr’om emphysema, or fr'om the effusion of serous fluid into the sheaths of the tendons, which gives rise to a peculiar crackling sensation, very different from the rough grating of a fr-acture. It vill thus be seen that each of these three signs, taken individually, is more or less equivocal, and that it usually requires a combination of at least two of them to determine whether fracture exists. In ascertaining the exist- ence of a fracture, the Siu’geon should make the necessary manipulations with the utmost gentleness, but yet effectually, so that no uncertainty may be allowed to remain as to the seat and nature of the injury, more especially when it occurs in the vicinity of a joint. The increased mobility may be ascertained by fixing the upper fragment and rotating the lower portion of the limb ; the gating by di’awing down the lower fragment, so as to bring the rough siu'faces into apposition, and then grasping the limb at the seat of fractime with one hand, and rotating it gently with the other. The displacement must be ascer- tained by measuring the limb carefully in the way that has been directed, and by comparing the injiu’ed with the sound side. Diagnosis. The diagnosis of an ordinary fractm-e is seldom attended by any material difficulty. The co-existence of displacement, of abnormal mobility, and of grating, wiU usually enable the Siu-geon at once and readily 0 pronounce with certainty its existence, when it is simple. When it is com- pmncl,th.QYQ IS frequently the additional evidence afforded by the protrusion of snL?/ 5 and if it be comminuted as well, the loose splinters will bo readily felt.35S FRACTURES. There are, however, two conditions that render tlie detection of a simple fracture occasionally difficult. The first is, when only one of two, or several contiguous bones is broken ; the other, the impaction of the frag^nents. When only one bone is broken in a situation where there are two or more, as in the leg, forearm, metacarpus or metatarsus, very close and careful mani- pulation of the injiu-ed bone may be required. The Siu-geon rnust run his finger carefully over the most projecting ridge, feel for slight inequality or oedema at one part, or perhaps he may elicit the faintest occasional crepitus on fully and deeply mo’ving the bone at the seat of suspected fractmu. In the case of impaction the diagnosis is even more difficult. Here no crepitus, and no preternatural mobility, can be foimd ; but the Siu’geon must be led to his diagnosis by the recognition of the pecuhar displacement and distortion which may be characteristic of the particular fractine, as, for instance, the deformity of the wrist in impacted fractine of the lower end of the radius. The difficulties of diagnosis in fractine of a single bone, or in an impacted fractine, are necessarily most seriously increased if there be much extravasation of blood into the limb ; or, when the fracture is through an articulated end, if there should be much effusion into the neighboining joint. As has already been stated, the existence of a fractine when compound, and more particularly .if comminuted, is usually readily determined. Here, the great mobility, the protrusion of fragments or sphnters, and the ready crepitns, inU seldom allow the Surgeon to be in error. Should any doubt exist, the introduction of the finger into the woinid ivill enable him to determine noth certainty, not only the existence, but the condition and extent of the fractine. But mth all the assistance that may thus be afforded, the very existence of a bad compound and comminuted fr’acture may be imsusj)ected for many days, even though most careful examinations have been made vdth the view of ascer- taining its presence. Of this important fact, which may have weighty bearings in medico-legal investigations, the following case is a good illustration. A young man was shot noth a wooden rannod through the left hand and shoulder, by the accidental exj)losion of his gun whilst he was loadmg it. The rami-od struck the humerus three inches below the shoulder-joint, full on its fore part. It was splintered against the bone, the fragments passing on each side, and mostly escaping through two apertmes of exit posteriorly; some passing to the iimer side between the large vessels and the bone, the others to the outer side between it and the deltoid. The patient was brought to the Hospital, where I saw him a few hours after the injury, and, enlarging the iroimds, extracted a number of splinters of the rannod fr’om around the bone. The limb was carefully examined, not only by me, but by several other Smgeons present, to determine whether the bone had been fractined, or the joint injm-ed. There was no sign of fr-acture to be detected—no shortening, no mobility, no crepitus, no inequality when the fingers were fr’eely passed into the wounds, no displacement at all. As no fr'acture appealed to ® limb was laid on a pillow, and irrigation employed. Erysipelas set m, followed by extensive and deep suppuration in the limb. On examining tus, wi e view of giving a free exit to the discharges, eight days after the accicent, is placement and crepitus were for the first time found, and it became evi eii359 UNION OF FRACTURED BONE.

The patient died of iiYfemia ; and after death the bone presented the appearance here given (Lug 138), a long splinter having been detached in a longitudinal direction, A B, ancl the shaft broken across at c. Here, then, was not only a compound, but a comminuted fracture, detected for the fu-st time a week after the infliction of the injury. It appeared probable that the blow of the ramrod had fractuied the bone longitudinally, detaching the large splintci, which had become impacted ; and that the shaft still held together by a naiTOW bridge of bone at C, which being broken across subsequently in moving the limb, now become heavy^ by inflarmnatory infiltration, led to the shortening of the limb and the lateral displacement of the fragments. Uniou' of Fractured Bone.—A fractured bone is ulti- mately united by being soldered together by the deposition of new bone around, within, and lastly between the broken fragments. In exceptional cases, as in fractures occiuTing Avithin the capsule of a joint, and in those of the patella and the olecranon, imion is effected by fibrous or filamentous tissue. In some instances that wfll hereafter be considered, owing to pecuhar local or constitutional circumstances, new bone is not formed, but the uniting medium is fibrous. The new bone that constitutes the bond of union is termed Callus. In many cases a larger quantity of this is temporarily deposited than is perma- nently left. This temporary formation of bone goes by the name of the provisional callus. It is formed partly external to the fractme, incasing the broken ends, and partly in the medullary canal, so as to include the fragments between layers of irew bone, and thus maintain them in contact. That which is permanently left, arrd which intervenes between the brokerr errds, is called the definitive callus. The process of urriorr varies somewhat hr simple arrd in compormd fractm’es. Union of Simple Fractures.—The prodrretion of callus has beerr strrdied Avith mrrch care by Haller, Duhamel, Bordenave and Hunter, by Drrpuytren, Breschet, and YiUerme, arrd more recently by Stanley, Paget, and Biflroth. From the obserwations of these pathologists, it would appear that the union of a broken bone takes place through the medium of plastic matter, deposited by a process of adhesive inflammation set up irr the injured borre itself, in its periosterrm, arrd in the rreiglrboming soft parts ; the lymph thrrs formed gj’adually undergoirrg developmerrt iirto osseous tissrre. The whole process, indeed, is strictly arralogous to that which takes place irr the ordirrary healirrg of a Avound by adhesiorr arrd the dcA'clopmerrt of the cicatricial tissrre. The broken fragments are at first movable, and surTOurrded by a considerable extra- vasation of blood. Irr the coru’se of ton or forudeen days, this has ordmarily undergone absorption to a considerable extent; the periosterrm arrd the medul- lary membrane in the vicinity of the fractruc, the tissrres arourrd it, arrd the l)roken bone itself, become A-ery vascular, and pom* out a quarrtity of lymph between and arorrnd the fr-agments, as well as withirr the medullary canal, so that the fractrrred ends arc enshcathed by a reddish gelatinous inass of a fusi-FRACTURES. 360 form shape, thickest opposite the seat of injmy. Tliis gradually becomes more and moie consolidated; and, in proportion as it becomes firmer, the mobility of the fiagments lessens, and, the ends of the bone becoming smooth by the plastic deposit being adherent to and interposed between them, grating is less distinct. Irom the third to the foiu’th week the lymph has assumed a sufficient degree of firmness to keep the fragments in apposition, though the bone still yields readily at the seat of fi’acture (Fig. 139). This lymph, which is poiu’ed out not only by the periosteum and bone, but by all the soft parts in the neighbomhood of the fractm'c, gradually undergoes ossification, the bony matter being first deposited in a granular manner, but in sufficient quantity by the sixth or eighth week to unite the fracture rather firmly. The callus, which is at first soft and spongy, and differs from old bone in its microscopic as well as ordinary physical characters, gradually assimilates to old bone, both in hardness and in structiu’e, osseous corpuscles and vascular laminated canals being formed in it; and it becomes smooth on the siu’face, being invested by a dense ceUulo-fibrous periosteum, until, by the end of six or eight months, ossification is perfect. The last j)rocess in the consohdation of the fracture is the formation of new bone between the broken ends. This does not 'take place definitely until a considerable period after the ensheathing callus has been formed. BiUi’oth of Vienna, who has investigated this process, finds that cells are developed m the Haversian canals ; and that these become dilated by the gi-adual absorption of then bony walls, while the cells increase in number, and the blood-vessels form loops. Thus there is a removal of old tured TUia^ tissue, and a deposit of new plastic matter; and these processes go on at both the fractiued ends, so that the new deposits meet and unite, and ultimately become converted into bone. In some instances, however, the plastic matter, instead of being ossified, imdergoes transformation mto [)a fibrous tissue, as in the ordinary cicatrices of soft parts, giving rise to false joints, of which we shall speak hereafter. By the time that the intermediate or definitive callus is fully formed, that portion of the ensheathing or provisional callus which is not required for the jneser- vation of the permanent integvity of the bone, has been gradually removed, or has moulded itself closely to the shape and condition in which it will ultimately remain, the medullary canal having again become free, and the ends of the fr’actiu’e rounded off’. In so mpcases the medullary cavity is not restored to its former condition for a considerable time, continuing to be partially occluded by a thin septum of callus. According to Paget, the plastic matter that is effused around and between the bones urrdergoes ossification irr various ways. Those fr’actrues that mrite qirickly do so most commorrly thr’ough ossification of fibrous tissrre, in ^ mental condition, which may be either that of irrrcleated cells or nuceate blastema. A fine closely granular ossific deposit talces place in the blasterua, and gTadually forms the lanrirrjE of a delicate cancellous tissrre, t e nuc er becoming probably corrverted into bone-corpuscles. Irr other cases aganr t e union may be accomplished by the ossification of perfect fibrmrs tissue, developed from the plastic matter throwrr out round the fructruc. on again, 139.—Sec- of Frac-UNION OF FRACTURED BONE. 361 the new bone may be formed by the plastic exudation passing through a carti- lao-inous stage. Pm-e foetal cartilage has so far only been seen in the lower animals ; in man, the cartilage has always been of the fibrous variety. In those fractmes that arc transverse, and that remain in steady apposi- tion diu-ing ossification, and more especially if they be but thinly covered by soft parts, the union appears to take place directly and immediately between the opposed osseous surfaces ; there being no appearance of those accessoiy deposits of bone that usually go by the name of “provisional callus.” If, however, the fractine occur in a bone that is thickly invested by soft parts, masses of new bone will be thrown out around the fragments, evidently the result of deposition from the siuTounding inflamed tissues rather than from the injined periosteum or bone. The influence of the neighbouring soft parts in determining the. deposits of new bone is W'ell marked in the tibia. In a fractiu-e of this bone Ave And that, at the anterior and imier pai-t, Avhich is thinly covered, union takes place directly between the broken cuds : but at the posterior and outer side, Avhere there is a thick envelopment of tissue, a large mass of proAusional caUus will often be found, filling up even the interosseous space. That neighbourmg parts participate in the inflammation set up around the fractiu’e, and throw out callus, is evident from what takes place occasionally when one of the bones of the forearm or leg is broken. Periostitis is then set uj) in the unbroken bone, oj>posite the seat of fractm-e, and osseous matter is sometimes deposited by it. We have specimens illustrating this point in the University College Museum. In fractmes ocemTing in young infants, the quantity of callus throwi out is proportionately very gveat. This may perhaps be owing to the difficulty of maintaining such fractmes in steady apposition, and partly also to the activity of the nutritive process. If the fractme be not Avell reduced, the ends not being in proper apposition, or if it be commumted, masses of new bone are often deposited as buttresses or supports, or, enveloping the splinters, consolidate them Avith the rest of the shaft. So, also, Avhen the fractmed bones are not kept sufficiently quiet dming treatment, the neighboming parts become irritated, and proAusional callus is formed. Hence, as Paget has remarked, Ave connnonly find this deposit in frac- tmes of the ribs, AA^hich are kept in constant motion by the resphatory actions. In impacted fractmes there is, from the perfect apposition of the smfaces, but little callus foimed. From all this, I think it clear that in simple fr'actmes the p'ovisional caUus is deposited principally by the surroimding soft tissues, and also, to a certain extent, by the periosteum and medullary canal, its quantity being- dependent on the amount of in-itation sot up in these structures. The definitwe callus, on the other hand, is directly and immediately formed by the vessels of the fractured bone itselfi and the comparative Avant of A’ascular supply to this tissue may account for the sIoaatlcss of its formation. ^ Union of Compound Fractures.—The difference botAveen the miion of a simple and of a compound fracture is the same as that betAveen the heahno- of a subcutaneous and an open Avound. In the one case, the healing process takes place without any sensible local disturbance or constitutional'^derano-e- ment; in the other, it is accompanied by local inflannnation and suppuration.FllAOTURES. 362 and by corresponding febrile reaction. In the one case, there is no exciting cause for the development of secondary diseases ; in the other, the local mischief is extremely apt to generate these in their worst forms, as eiysipelas, inflammation of the absorbents or veins, and pyaemia. In comjeoimd fractures, union takes place by the ends of the bone, which lie bathed in the pus of the Avound, granulatmg and tin-owing out plastic matter, Avhich becomes directly couAnrted into bone. There is in many cases bnt little provisional callus ; but in most instances a large quantity of accessory osseous deposit takes place, more particularly if the displacement be great. The union of these fractures precisely resembles that of a Avouud in the soft structures—^Ijy gTanulation, or “ the second intention ; ” the only difference being that the granulations which •are thrown out by the bone and periosteum develop into new osseous tissue either directly, or through the medium of an antecedent fibroid transformation. This process necessarily occupies a much longer time than that which is required for the union of a simple fracture, consohdation not being effected fox- three or four months, and often being very considerably retarded beyond this by the separation of necrosed bone, the formation of abscesses, &c. Eokitansky and some other pathologists are of opinion that superficial exfoliation of that layer of bone xvhich is bathed by the pus takes place, and that it is after this is separated that the granulations spring up, in which the nexv bone is deposited ; but I think that it admits of very considerable doubt whether this process of necrosis goes on in all cases of compound fractiu-e. Union of fi-actiu’es, like all other vital actions, takes place moi’e i-eadily and much more quickly in the early periods of life than at a more adA-anced age, and is abvays more speedily accomphshed in the upper than in the lower extremities. TBEATMENT OF PBACTURE. Constitutional Treatment in simple fractures requires but a very few Avords of explanation. As a rule, the general habits of life should be interfered Avith as bttle as possible. In uncompheated fr-actm-es of the upper extremities, more especially in the yoimg, rest for a few days in bed is aU that is needed. The patient may then be allowed to move about moderately with the liinb supported on proper apparatus. In the fr-actm-es of the lower extremities more lengthened rest is needed. In these cases the diet may be some- what reduced, and aperients given Avith advantage for the fii-st week 01- ten days. After this the usual habits of life in these respects should be resumed. In old pei-sons the enforced confinement to bed and the sudden inteiTuption of the ordinary habits of bfe, as well as the shock to the system, are apt to exercise an injurious and sometimes a fatal effect. In these cases there arc two dangers to apprehend, viz,, sloughing of the back and hypostatic congestion of the lungs. Both are avoided by propping the patient np in bed, the use of water or air cushions, and change of postme as far as piactica e. is necessary to see that the bed is very smooth and fu-m ^AAdthout creases a all crumbs be swept aAvay daily; and that scrupulous attention c paic to cleanliness after the use of the bed-pan. Good diet and a fail a OAAance o^ stimulants arc needed in these cases. The early use of the staichec 01 p as eiTREATMENT OF SIMPLE FRACTURE. 363 of Taris bandage is of great service in enabling tlie patient to get np sooner than could otherwise be done. Ill all cases of simple fracture of the lower extremities, the sooner the patient is o-ot np and about on crutches the better. Some patients speedily learn to use these instrimients, others never get accustomed to their use. In the latter case, a wheel-chair should be substituted for them. Surgical Treatment of Simple Fracture.—In conducting the treatment of a fracture, the object of the Surgeon should be not only to obtain a sound and strong limb, but one that presents as little deformity and trace of fomer injury as possible. lu order to accomplish this, the broken ends of the bone must be brought into as perfect apposition as possible, the recurrence of dis- placement must be prevented, and the local and constitutional condition of the patient properly attended to. AVhen the Siu-geon is called to a person who has met with a fractui’e, if it be a sei'erc one of the upper extremity, or of any kind of the lower limbs, he must see that the bed, on -which the patient may have to remain for some weeks, is property prepared, by being made hard, flat, and Ann, and, if possible, covered with a horse-hair mattress. The Singeon must then superintend the removal of the patient’s clothes, having them ripped along the seams, so that they may be taken off with as little distinbance as possible to the injured part. He next proceeds to the examination of the broken limb, using ei'ery possible gentleness consistent uith acquiring a proper knowledge of the fracture. After he has satisfied himself upon this point, the limb should be laid upon a soft pillow, until any necessary apparatus has been prepared. Reduction.—When all has been got ready, the reduction of the fractin-e, or the bringing the fragments mto proper apposition, must be proceeded with. This should, if possible, always be done at once, not only lest any displacement that exists may continue permanently—the muscles, after a few days, becoming shortened, rigid, and unyielding, not allowing reduction to be effected -without the employment of much force—but also with the view of preventing imtation and mischief to the hmb, by the projection of the sharp and jagged ends of bone into the soft structmes. A gveat deal of time is sometimes lost, and much unnecessaiy pain inflicted upon the patient, and great imtation set up in the limb, by the Siu’geon leaving the fracture imreduced on a pillow for several days, and applying evaporating lotions to take do-v^nl the sweUiiig and avert the thi'eatened inflammation, ivhich are consequences of the non-reduction of the broken bone. The application of cold lotions, irrigation, &c., in compound or even in simple fr’actures is decidedly injurious. It lowers the Autality of the part, retards union, and occasions oedema. By early reduction -we may some- times prevent a shaiq) firagment from perforating the skin, and thus rendering a simple fracture compound, or lacerating muscles and nen'es, inducing perhaps traumatic delirium and certainly undue local inflammatory and spasmodic action. The chief cause of displacement in fractures has already been stated to be muscular contraction ; hence, in effecting reduction of a fracture and in removing the displacement, our principal difficulty is the action of the muscles of the part. This must and always may be counteracted, by properly relaxing them by position ; so soon as this is done, the bony fragments will naturally fall into place ; but no amount of extension and of counter-extension can bringFRACTURES. 364 these into position, find much less retain them there, imless all muscular influ- ence be rcmoYed. In ordinary fractures, no force is necessary or should ever be employed for accomplishing this ; but attention to the attachment of the muscles of the limb and proper relaxation of them is all that is requii’cd. In impacted fractures it is occasionally necessary to use force in order to dis- entangle the fragments, but this is the only form of fractmn in which its employment is justifiable. In effectmg the reduction, not only must the length of the limb be restored, but its natural ciu'ves must not be obliterated Ijy making it too straight. Prevention of Return of Displacement.—After the reduction has been accomplished, means must be taken to prevent the retimi of the displacement; for, if the parts be left to themselves, muscular action, or the involuntary move- ment of the patient, mU be certain to bring about a return of the faulty position. In many cases, it is exceedingly difficult, for the first few days, to keep the ends of the bone in place, in consequence of spasmodic movement of the muscles of the limb, or of restlessness on the part of the patient. About this, however, the Surgeon need not be anxious, as no union takes place for the fii-st week or ten days ; at the expiration of that time the muscles wiU have probably lost their instability, and the patient have become accustomed to his position, so that with a little patience, or by varying the apparatus and the position of the limb, good apposition may be maiatained. The retm’n of displacement is prevented, and the proper shape and length of the limb are maintained, by means of landages, sjAmfs, and special apparatus of various kinds. In applying these, care shoidd be taken not to exert any undue pressime on or forcible extension of the limb. Pads and compresses of all kinds should, if possible, be avoided; they do no good that cannot be effected by proper position, and even occasion serious mischief by inducing sloughing of the integuments, over which they are applied. A screw-appa- ratus has been invented with the view of forcing fragments into proper position, but nothing cair be more imsm’gical and unscientific than such barbarous contrivances. In cases in which there is much tendency to a retmai of the displacement, it has been recommended to diwide the tendons of some of the stronger muscles inserted into the lower fragment. This, however, can very rarely be necessary; and in those cases in which I have done it, or seen it done, no material benefit has resulted. The Bandages used for fractiu’es should be the ordinary gvey caheo rollers, about three finger-breadths in width, and eight yards in length. In applyiug them, especial care must be taken that the timns press evenly upon every part, and that the bandage be not applied too tightly in the fii’st instance. No bandage should be apphed under the splints, more particularly at the fleximes of joints, and care must be taken that the limb be not bent, or its position otherwise materially altered, after bandages have been applied. A baiidage wider the splints is not only useless, but highly dangerous, by inducing risk of strangulation. No bandage should be applied to the paid of the limb that is the seat of fracture. The part below the fracture may be sometimes adA'an- tageously bandaged, in order to prevent oedema; thus, in fracture of the humerus, the fingers and forearm may be bandaged with this view, but no turnsBANDAGES AND SPLINTS. 3^5 of the roller should be brought above the elbow. This point of practice I con- sider most important, as the application of a bandage to the immediate seat of fracture not only causes gveat pain and disturbance of the limb, but danger of .ranmene. When once a fractured limb has been “put up,” the less it is dis- tiu-bed the better. No good can possibly come, but a great deal of pain must necessai-ily result to the patient, from meddling with it. The Surgeon should always bear in mind that, in the treatment of a fractured bone, he can do absolutely notliing to promote its union, beyond placing it in a good and easy position. Natiu’e—the natimal reparative action of the body solders the bone together: and the less the Surgeon interferes ivith the natural processes of repair, the more satisfactorily Avill imion be accomplished. But it is requisite to examine the limb from time to time during the treatment, and especially about the second or third iveek, Avhen union is commencing, in order, if neces- sary, to coirect displacement. In the earlier stages, supervision is necessary lest the bandage be too tight; and, if the patient complain of any pain or numbness, or if the extreme part look blue and feel cold, the bandage must be immediately removed ; for, though the apparatus have not been applied tightly, sweUing of the limb may come on fr’om various causes, to such an extent as to produce strangulation and consequent gangrene of it, as I have seen happen in at least three instances, the hmb requiring amputation in each case (Fig. 145). It is remarkable, that the whole of a limb will faU into a state of gangrene hi these cfrciimstances, with but little pain, and often with very shght constitutional distmhance, the parts having their sensibility deadened by the gradual conges- tion and infiltration of the tissues. When such an unfortunate accident happens, recourse must be had to immediate amputation. Before applying the apparatus in a case of fr’actme, aud as often as it is taken off, it is a good plan to sponge the limb with warm soap and water, which prevents the itching that otherwise ocem-s and is sometimes very troublesome. The Splints that are used in cases of fracture are of various kinds. Tin, wood, leather, and gutta-percha, are the materials usually employed. For some kinds of fr-actiire, special, and often very compheated apparatus, is very generally used; but the Sm’geoii should never confine himself to one material, or one exclusive mode of treating these injuries, as in different cases special adAmitages may be obtained from different kinds of splints. Wood and tin are principally employed in the loiver extremity, ivhere great strength is required to counteract the weight of the limb and the action of its muscles ; and care must be taken to pad very thoroughly splints made of these materials. Leather, gutta-percha, aud pasteboard, are more commonly useful in fractures of the upper extremity, tl^ough they may not unfrequently be employed with advantage in those of the lower limbs. In applying them, a pattern should first be cut out in brown paper, of the proper size and shape; the material must then be softened by being well soaked in hot water, and moulded on to the part Avhilst soft: as soon as it has taken the proper shape, it should, if leather or gutta-percha be used, be hardened by being plunged into cold vinegar and water ; the pasteboai-d must be alloAved to diy of itself. Its edges may then be feathered and the corners rounded, and its interior lined Avith wash-leather or lint. These splints liaA’e the advantage of gi’eat durability, cleanliness, and lightness. The material of Avhich the sjDlint IS composed is of loss consequence than its mode of application. There are tAvo?66 l^RACTUJiES. points that require special attention in this respect:—I, that when the splint is flat it should be sulticicntly broad to extend to the exterior of the limb, and not to press into it ; and 2, that it should embrace securely and fix steadily the tvvo joints connected with the fi’actured bone ; if the thigh, the hip and knee ; if the leg, the knee ami ankle. From want of attention to these points of practice much trouble is often occasioned in keeping the fragments in steady apposition, and much deformity often results. It is impossible to keep the fragments perfectly immobile, and in close and accrrrate apposition, unless these very important points be attended to. Special Apparatus should be employed as little as possible in the treatment of fr-actures. It is scarcely ever necessary in simple fracture, and is iiir more cumbersome and costly than the means above indicated, which are all that can be required. I have no hesitation in saying, that a Siu’geon of ordinary in- genuity and mechanical skill may be fully prepared to treat successfully every fractiu’e to which he can be called, by haAdng at hand a smooth deal plank half an inch in thickness, and a sheet of gutta-percha, undressed sole-leather’, or pasteboard, to cut into splints as requfr-ed.

In addition to this, the patient will often be able to cany on his business during treatment. By employing the starched bandage in the way that u'ill be iumiediately pointed out, I scarcely ever find it necessaiy to keep patients in bed Avith simple frac- tures of the leg for more than six or seven days, thus saAing much of the tediousness and danger of the treatment. The foUoAA'ing is the mode of applyiiig this apparatus that is adopted at the University College Hospital, and Avhich aaHI be found to ansAver Avell. The Avfrole limb is euA'cloped, as recommended by BurggTaeA'e, of Ghent, in a layer of cotton-wadding, Avhich is thickly laid along and over the osseous promi- nences ; this, being elastic, accommodates itself to the subsequent diminution in size of the limb, and keeps up more equable pressure. Over the cotton- Avadding are laid sph'nts of thick and coarse pasteboard soaked in thin starch, properly shaped to fit the limb. The pasteboard should be soft, not milled, and be doubled and torn down, not cut, as in this AA'ay the edges are not left shaqn If much strength be not required, as in children, or in some fr-actures of the upper extremity, a feAV slips of broAAm j)apcr, Avell starched, may be substituted for the j)asteboard. A bandage saturated A\'ith thick starch is now firmly applied ; and lastly, this is covered by another dry roller, the inner sides of the timis of AA'hich may be starched as it is laid on. JSTo roller or bandage shoidd be applied directly to the fr-actm-ed part under the splints : its apj)lica- tion is always painful and difficult, and it is attended Avith danger of constric- tion or abrasion. Both the pasteboard splints and the starched bandage should ahvays include the t>vo joints above and beloA\^ the fracture, so that Fig. 142.—Application of Seutin’s Filers to Starciieil llamlage. complete immobility of the fraginents may bo secured : the hip and knee A\hen the thigh is broken ; the knee and ankle Avhen the leg is fractured.

The drying of the starch may, if necessary, be hastened liy the applica- tion of hot sand-bags to the apparatus. After the bandages have become quite dry, the temporary splint must be removed, and the patient may then be allowed to move about on crutches, taking care, of course, to keep the injured limb well slung up, and not to bear upon it, or to jar it against the ground (Fig. 140). In the course of about three or four days after its application, the apparatus mU usually be found to have loosened somewhat, the limb appearing to shrink Avithin it. In these cu’cumstances it becomes necessary to cut it up with a pair of Seutm’s pliers, such as are represented in Fig. 141. This section must be made, as represented hi Fig. 142, along the more muscular part of the limb, so that the skin covering the bones be not injimed; and, after paring the edges of the splint, it must be reapphed by means of tapes or a roller. In trimming the edges of the splint, it should not be removed from the limb. If the fracture be compound, a trap may be cut in the apparatus opposite the seat of injiuy, thi-ough which the woimd may be dressed (Fig. 143). Although folly recognising the great adi’antages to be obtained by treating ftaotm-es on this plan, and employing the starched bandi^e in almost eTery case that came under my care, I did not at tost think that it ,vas safe practice to have reoonrae to it during the early stages of fractm-e ; imtil, indeed, the swellino- of the limb had begun to subside. I therefore never apphed it until the sirth, or eighth, or tenth day, keeping the limb, until this time, properly reduced upon a splint, vei7 lightly bandaged, and wet with cold evaixiiating lotions ■ fearing that, if the bandage were applied at too eaily a peiiod, the inilammatoiT tm-geseence of the limb might give rise to a slow strangulation of it imder the apparatus. , rw , • , i a Diirino- many years, however, I employed Seiitm’s plan in seveml himdi'eds of fractm-es of all kinds, puttmg the limb up in the parched apparatus mrmXaklv after the reduction of the ftacture.

From no other means of treatment have I seen such satishictory results in cases of fractiu-ed thigh, as from the starched apparatus ; patients having frequently been cured without any appreciable shortening, with the pre- servation of the natm-al cur\-e of the bone, and without confinement to bed after the first Aveck. In compound fr’actures also of the leg, and eA'eii of the thigh, I have ob- tained most satisfactory results fr-om this means. In compound fractures of the leg, I have seen the patient Avalking about on crutches as early as the tenth or fourteenth day, the limb being securely put up in starch ; and have more frequently succeeded in getting union of the woiuid, and consequently in conA'erting the compound into a simple fracture, by putting up the limb in this apparatus than in any other. Glue may be substituted for starch in stiffening the fracture apparatus. The glue used for this pm-pose should be prepared by making a strong solution of the best French glue, and then adding to this about one-eighth of spirits of wine. This mixture may then be thickly brushed over the bandage. After di-ying, the apparatus should be cut up, trimmed, and fixed on by straps, lacings, or bandages, as most convenient. It possesses the advantages over the starched bandage of drying more quickly, and of being lighter and more elastic, but it is not so strong or so Avell adapted for pmqooses of support when the whole of a muscular limb or large joints have to be included. The Plaster of Paris Bandage may often be advantageously used as a substitute for the starched apparatus. It may be apphed in one of the three following ways. 1. A bandage of coarse soft muslin has dry plaster of Paris thoroughly rubbed into its meshes : it is then rolled up, and some cold water is poured upon each end of it so as to moisten it through. A dry flannel roller having- been previously applied to the limb, the Avetted plaster bandage is smoothly rolled over it, the Siu-geon taking care that no reverses are made. In order to avoid these, it may be applied in a spnal or figure-of-8 manner over the more unequal parts. Sli^Ds of the plaster bandage should also be laid on AA^here additional strength is required, and the AA'-hole well wetted from time to time during the application. It hardens in the course of a fcAV minutes, and, as it dries, forms a solid, hard, and light casing to the limb, affording excellent support to the fracture. The plaster bandage possesses the advantage over the starched apparatus of being lighter, and especially of drying and hardening vepy quickly quahties AA'hich render it invaluable in cases in Avhich it is neces- saiy to can-y patients any distance immediately after the setting of the fractm-e. 2. Neudorfer is a strong advocate for the employment of the plaster of a,ris bandage. Ho recommends that it should be applied immediately (on s he lays great stress), in the folioAving Avay. ComiDresses of linen, or of mt, are dipped in plaster of Paris of the consistence of a common poultice, ese are then placed longitudinally on the lijnb, first on the upper, then on e lUKler part. A fcAV turns of a bandage keep them in siiii till the plaster is fir o d s contiguous edges from adhering, they are slightly greased, ‘ slip of greased lint is put betAvecn them. VOL. I. B BFRACTURES. 370 ILe sometimes uses pieces of thin -wood, like veneer, lined with cotton-wool, next the skin ; over these the bandage, saturated with the plaster, is aj^plied by circnlar tnnis in the nsnal way. In applying the plaster bandage, no cotton- Avool or other soft material need otherwise be laid between it and the skin. Idle bandage, soaked in plaster of the consistence of cream, is first applied in a circular manner, in the neighbourhood of the fracture, which has prc- I’iously been reduced. If this be compound, the wound must not be covered by the turns of the bandage. Three superimposed layers are usually suflicient to give stability. The same method is then applied to the bone above and beloAV the fracture. The bandage, if properly applied, should bo cpiite firm in eight minutes. The opening of the wound is then to bo covered vith cotton- wool of sufficient thickness to be on a level with the bandage ; and over this must be fastened a handkerchief or ordinary bandage. As soon as the whole limb has been thus covered in, a diy strip of simple bandage is placed along its whole length, and a' piece of wire along each side of this; and the whole is then smeared and smoothed down Avith plaster of Paris. While the mixture is still moist, and before it is quite set, the ends of the Avh-es are ch-awn up, and the casing is thus cut through by two narrow fuiTOAVs along its whole length, by Avhich it is in no way weakened. When it is necessary to remove the apparatus, the ends of the dry slip of bandage Avhich lies between the furrows, are drawn up together', and a lid of plaster of Paris is removed. The srrbjacent plastered bandage is then easily cut through by scissors. In the case of a large limb, this proceeding may be adopted in seA’eral places, so that the apparatus may be cut into as marry pieces as is necessary. The setting of the plaster may be retarded by the addition to it of sohrtiorr of borax. Thus a solution of 1 part to 12 of the water used will retard the settirrg fifteerr mirrrrtes ; and 1 to 8 will retard it fifty minrrtes, and so orr. 3. The method of applying the plaster apparatus, as practised in the Bavarran army dru'ing the Prarreo-German War, is as follows. Two pieces of flannel, twenty inches broad, are stitched together dowrr the middle for the length of the leg; and beyond this both are cut through in the same line for the length of the^foot. The flarurel is placed under the limb, so that the seam reaches from the ham to the heel. The sides of the irrrrer piece are brought together over the leo- and fixed in front, and along the sole, by hare-hp pins (bent at a right ano-le^ so that they may be easily extracted aftenvards), and thus a closely fitting stocking is formed. The sides of the outer piece are then brought for- wards and cut, so that each may overlap the middle line of the leg and sole by three-quarters of an inch. The limb- is then laid on one side: and while the outer piece of flannel is held back, a layer of plaster of Pans of the consistence of thici cream is spread evenly, to the thickness of half an inch, over the nmei piece, andmade to pass quite to the seam behind, and the line of junction of the kies of the inner piece in front. The outer piece is pressed over this befoie it reach the middle line in fr'ont and along the sole. wtn to has set, Ihe limb is tun.ed over, and the process ,s y " othcrsidc. The pins may now beremoved tlmphitc^ when the whole has set, the splint may be taken off, the edges trimmed, and those of the inner piece of flannel cut so as to leave suffic JACCIDENTS DURING TREATMENT. zn turn over and stitch down on the outer piece. The splint is then re-adjusted and fixed by a bandage (Fig. 144). Fig. 144.—Bavarian Plaster Splint: adjustment of tlie Flannel Layers. Tn all cases in which the plaster bandage is used, there is danger of unsafe constriction of the limb after the setting of the plaster, either in conse- quence of the atiparatus hating been apphed too tightly, or of the inner bandage, which has been directly applied to the limb, becoming tightened ,by the swelling of the member within it. Hence great care must be taken for several days after the application of the apparatus, to watch the limb carefully, and if signs of over constrictions come on, such as pain, coldness, numbness, and oedema of the extremities, whether toes or fingers, immediately to cut it up, re-adjust, or remove it. Ho time shoidd be lost in doing this, as the limb may have become gangTenous in patches, with little suffering to the patient or constitutional distiu’bance. In the treatment of ordinary simple fractures of the shafts of long bones, the following are the chief points that require attention : 1. To effect reduction at once, and with as httle distm’bance of the limb as. possible. 2. Hot to apply any roller to the part of the limb in which the fi’acture is. situated, nor under the apparatus. 3. To line, pad, or wad the apparatus thickly. . f' iiiclude and fix in the aj)j)aratus the two joints connected with the injured bone. 0. To disturb the apparatus as seldom as jjossible. fi. To use starched jiasteboard or plaster apparatus, when jiracticable, in preterence to any more special form of apphance. Accidents during Treatment.—Various accidents are liable to occur fin mg e treatment of a fracture ; some of these are gerreral, others special. A^ngst the more general accidents, Tetairus, Traumatic Deliriimr, and Erysi- pe as may e mentioned as the most common. Anrongst the more special the occurTence of Spasm of the Muscles of the Limb, Abscess, (Edema, Hanoi-ene ancl Cerebral Corrgestion, are those that'’have most to be guarded against. In order to prevent the occuri’ence of these corrditiorrs, the gerreral health operr, 5reImn the use of allowed, and long confinement to bed avoided by a movable-immovable” apparatrrs, as above described. >e reatment of the more general accidents presents rrothing that need B c 2372 FRACTURES. detain ns here ; bnt those that arc more special and peculiar to fractiu'cs, require consideration. Crutcli-palsy of the hands and arms may ocem.’ as the result of coiujiression of the brachial nerves against the pad of the crutch. The whole plexus, or only one of its component nerves, as the musculo-spiral, or ulnar, may be affected. The remedy is obvious—it consists in the discontinuance of the use of the crutch, and, if need be, the employment of electricity to the palsied muscles. Spasm of the Muscles of the Iiimh, owing to the indtation produced by the fragments, is often very severe so long as the' fracture is left imreduced; the shai-p end of the broken bone puncturing and irritating the surrounding muscles. It is best remedied by reduction, and the maintenance of the fracture in proper position by moderate pressure with a bandage. In troublesome cases, compression of the main artery of the limb has been recommended by Broca. If the spasm be dependent upon nervous causes, fall doses of opium will not unfr’equently afford relief. In some cases it is of a permanent character, pro- ducing considerable displacement of the fragments. In these circumstances, division of the tendons has been recommended ; but this practice appears to be an uimecessarily severe one, and may certainly most commonly be avoided by attention to the other plans of treatment which have been suggested. CEdema of a broken limb may occur fr’om several causes, viz., over-tight bandaging, dependent position, pressm-e of blood, extravasation, or inflamma- tory effusion. It is of no great moment in itself, but may be of consequence, as indicative of a liability to gangrene if left unreheved. The proper relief may usually be afforded by loosening the bandages, and elevating the limb. The oedema, which is often very persistent after the cm-e of the fracture, is best relieved by diligent friction, bandaging, and attention to position. Considerable Extravasation of Blood is fr-equently met mth in cases of simple fracture, causing great swelling and tension. By the continuous apph- cation of cold evaporating lotions, the collection is usually readily absorbed ; and the Siu’geon should never be tempted by any feeling of flmd or of fluctua- tion to open it, as he would thereby infallibly convert the simple into a com- pound fr-acture, and give rise to extensive ill-conditioned suppm-ation. ^ In some of the cases of extensive extravasation, the limb appears to reheve itseh of the serous portion of the blood effused, by the formation of large buUse or ~ 1 -11 *1 I T 1. /-\TI bleb's which may be punctured, or else allowed to burst and subside, uflthout any material inconvenience. This extravasation very rarely, indeed, runs into flhsppss • if it do, it must of course be opened, and treated upon ordinary prm- ciples. ’if deeply effused it may lead to gangvene, by the constriction compression which it exercises on the vessels of the hmb. _ Gangrene as a compheation of simple fracture is a most serious mischance, and on^ from which it is difficult for the Surgeon to exonerate himself without blame But he is not always in fault. It may arise from causes residing in the'limb. It may be contributed to by the neghgence of the patient in not drawino- the Surgeon’s attention to early symptoms, after ha^ng been duly w^rd!

Gangi’eue is almost invariably the consequence of the pernicious and dangerous practice of applying a bandage directlij to the limb under the ai^paratus. I have never known gangTene to occur after fracture, except Avhere this has been done, since it is much more likely to occur in those cases in which the fracture is treated by the unskilful application of an immovable apparatus, whether of starch, plaster of Paris, or other similar material, than where splints are used. Indeed, if the splints be well wadded, and no bandage be put on under them, it is almost impossible that an undue or dangerous amount of constriction can be exercised on the limb, so as to intemipt the cir- culation through it. I believe that this accident would rarely, if ever, occur. Fig. 145.—Gajigrene of Foreann and Hand from Tight Bandaging. if the Surgeon were to avoid the direct apphcation of a bandage to the limb, however lightly, in fractures, more particularly in chilcben. The danger of strangulation is especially great if, as happened in the case from which the accompanying cut is taken, the limb be bandaged whilst straight, and then flexed, as the bandage -will then cut in deeply at the flexm’e of the joint, and certainly destroy the vitality of the part, if not of the whole hmb. The pres- sure of an axillary pad, used in many of the fi’actiu’es of the upper extremities, may also tend to the supervention ol gangrene by interfering ivith the return of blood through the axillary vein, and thus causing sloiv strangulation under the : bandage. Hence in these cases the fingers should be left free at their tips, and j examined daily. Even if no direct bandage have been applied, the apparatus I should at once be removed, and the hmb examined, whenever the patient com- plains, e^ en of slight uneasiness : or, indeed, if any appearances of congestion, such as blueness, coldness, oedema, or vesication of the fingers and toes, show themselves. If it be left on beyond this, gangrene will probably set in, slow strangulation going on under the bandages without much, if any, pain. ; \ esications often create much alarm, but too much importance must not be f attached to their mere appearance. They will often occur of very large size, F as has already been stated, as a consequence of the raising of the cuticle by the I transuded serum of extravasated blood. It is only Avhen associated Avith cold- I ness of the limb, a dusky purple hue, and a putrescent odour, that they are ^ indicatiA'e of gangTene. excellent plan of judging of the activity of the cir- j culation in a fractmed limb after it has been put up, is to leave the ends of the ^ ngers or toes untovered by the bandage ; Avhen, by pressing upon one of the ! nails, the freedom of the circulation may be ascertained by noticing the rapidity f with Avhich the blood returns under it. A question of much°medico-leo'alFRACTURES. 374 importance occasionally arises in comicction witli gangrene of the limlj after simple fracture. It is this—is the gangTcne owing to over-tight and conse- quently negligent bandaging by the Surgeon, or to passive strangulation by inllammatory swelling of the limb under bandages not originally too tightly applied ? The diagnosis of the two conditions on which the answer is depen- dent is as follows. 1. When a bandage has been originally too tightl\' applied, the patient Avill suffer severely for several hours, the pain being felt inmiediately after the application of the apparatus. On loosening the bandage, the pain ceases. When removed, if gangrene have set in, the skin will be found pale where the roller has been applied—the limb being compressed and small at this part—marked wth imprints at the edges of the turns of the bandage, Avhilst it is greatly swollen and congested at the fingers or toes beyond the bandage ; these parts being also cold, pm-ple, and vesicated. 2. AYhen the strangulation occiu’s from spontaneous inflammatory SAvelhng of the limb, the whole member is equally swollen; it is red and blue, hot in parts, cold and sphacelated in others. It does never become uniformly gangrenous, but deep infiltrating abscess, and localised sphacelus, form. Treatment.—When a bandage or apparatus appears to be exerting luidue, painful, or dangerous pressure, it must at once be removed. Should the cir- culation of the limb have been interfered with, friction Avith camphorated oil in an upward direction should be employed. If gangrene have mihappily aheady occurred, the treatment will depend on the cause, and the conditions of the limb. If the gangrene be the result of self-strangulation of the limb, by its sweUiug up under the bandage, and it be found to be red, swollen, and infiltrated, free incisions should be made, and the limb enveloped in hot fomentations. If, notwithstanding this, abscesses form, ■with deep infiltration of the cellular tissue, and sloughing of the skin and muscles, the choice lies between amputation and the preservation of a limb that ■wiU be ■vnthered, contracted, and useless. If the gangrene be the result of direct strangulation of an o'\ er-tight bandage, as in Fig., 145, there is no resom-ce left but amputation above the seat of constriction. In fr’actiu-es of the lower extremity occiuTing in old people, there is a great tendency to Pulmonary and Cerebral Congestion, partly from detcimina- tion of blood, and partly as a consequence of the long confinement required : these fr-actures commonly prove fatal in this way. The use of the starched bandage, by enabling the patient to move about, is the most effectual preven- tive of these accidents. _ . CojVIPLICATED Feactubes.—Fractines may be complicated mth various important local conditions. Extravasation of blood into the limb, fr-om a wound of some large vessel, may go on to so great an extent as to occasion . strangmlation of the tissues; if not checked by position and cold applications, it may give rise to gangrene, and demand amputation. In other cases, again, the soft parts in the vicinity of the fractm-e may be contused to such a degree that they rapidly run into slough, thus rendering it compound; or a wound may exist, not communicating with the broken bone, but requiring muc i ^ modification of treatment, and special adaptation of apparatus. ^ 1 One of the most serious complications of a simple fractinc is undoubtedly j IFRACTURE- WITH RUPTURE OF ARTERY. 375 the Rupture of the Main Artery of the limb opposite the seat of fracture, or a wound of it by one of the fragments of broken bone. This accident chiefly occurs in fractures of the lower part of the femur or upper part of the tibia ; the popliteal in one case, and the posterior tibial in the otlier, being the vessel wounded. The symptoms consist in the rapid formation of an uniform elastic tense swelling of the limb, with obscure pulsation or thrill, opposite the seat of injury, and cessation of pulsation in the arteries at the ankle, with coldness and numbness of the foot and lower part of the leg. If the posterior tibial be the vessel injured, the circulation in the arteries of the foot may return after a day or two, and the coldness and numbness may lessen. If it be the popliteal that is injured, no such amelioration will take place, but the diffused aneurism in the ham will increase, the circulation will become more and more impeded, and gangrene Avill result. What should be the treatment of such a case as this ? The Sirrgeon has three alternatives. 1. The case may be treated as one of open arterial wound, the tumour laid open, and the injimed vessel ligatured at the seat of wound. The ob- jections to this treatment are, that a large ca’iiity is opened, which must sup- piu-ate, and 'will probably slough ; that the fracture is rendered a compomid one of the worst kind; and that the securing the artery is, in any circumstances, extremely difficult, and indeed luicertain, entaihng such an amount of dis- turbance of the soft parts as seriously to imperil the vitality of the hmb. 2. The circulation through the femoral artery may be arrested by com- pression or ligatiu’e of the vessel. I am not aware that compression has ever been tried in a case of diffused traumatic aneurism ; but there can be no reason why the effects of pressure upon the ai’tery, by means of Carte’s or some other proper compressor, should not be tried before proceeding to more severe measures. Should it not succeed, the artery may be tied in Scarpa’s triangle. x\n operation there has several times been successfully done in such cases, more especially when the hasmorrhage has been the result of laceration of the ])osterior tibial artery. But this operation should only be done in those cases in which, notwithstanding the existence of diffused traumatic aneurism in the ham, the pulsation has returned in the arteries of the foot, and the Avarmth and sensibihty of the member have been in part at least restored. If these CAidences of a return of circulation through the anterior tibial have not taken place, it AviU be worse than useless to ligature the femoral, as gangrene must inevitably ensue. 3. Amputation of the thigh may be performed. This severe measure need not be canied out at once. The Surgeon may AA”^ait a day or tAvo and Avatch the progress of OA'ents. If he find that there is no sign of restoration of pul- sation in the arteries of the foot, that the coldness and numbness of the limb continue to increase, and, in fact, that gangrene is impending, then the sooner he amputates the better for the patient’s safety. If the artery have been tied, and gangrene result, the limb ought at once to bo removed. . lo sum up, I Avould advise, in a case of diffused traumatic aneurism arisiim from and complicating a simple fracture of the loAver extremity : 1. Not to open the tumour and search for the artery at the seat of Avound ; 2. To compress or tie the femoral, if pulsation have returned or continue in theFRACTURES. 376 arteries of the foot; 3. Should pulsation not have returned within two or three days, should gangrene be imminent, or actually liave set in, or should the artery have been ligatured, and mortification have ensued, to ampiitate high in the thigh without farther delay. It will thus be seen that, in a diffused traumatic aneurism complicating a fracture of the bones of the lower extremity, the ordinary treatment of diffused traumatic aneurism must be departed from, for these reasons: 1. That, owing to the great displaceinent of parts and laceration of soft structures consequent on the fracture, it would be almost impossible to find the injured vessel; and, 2. That, if it were found, the opening up of the limb would leave a large ragged wound communicating widely with the broken bones, and leading to the wmrst foim of compound fracture, with an amount of disorganisation in the limb that could scarcely be recovered from. However extensively a bone may be comminuted, good imion will take place provided the fracture be simple ; that is, provided no w^otind exist in the limb by which air may gain admission to the fracture or to the soft parts implicated in it. I have seen the lower end of the femur crushed, as if by a sledge-hammer, into a multitude of fragments; and yet excellent union resulted, the fracture being simple, without even a breach of integument. In such a case as this, if there had been the smallest Avomid to admit air into the hmb, suppurative action of the most extensive and destructive character would undoubtedly have set in, and the patient’s limb at least, if not his life, would have been lost. It is impossible to overestimate the advantage of an injiuy of this kind being subcutaneous. A serious complication of simple fractiues consists in their Implicating a Joint. The fracture may extend into a neighbouring articulation, and thus give rise to considerable inflammatory action ; in strumous subjects this may lead to ultimate disorganisation of the articulation, requiring excision, w^hich I have several times had occasion to perform in these cases. But in healthy individuals a large articular surface may be traversed by lines of fractiue in several directions, without material inconvenience resulting. This we see in impnntp.fl fractiues of the condyles of the femur or of the lower end of the radius. In several instances of this kind in which I have examined the limb after death, no sign of disease of the part has been manifested beyond a moderate amount of injection of the ligaments; the fractrued incrusting cartilage uniting by plastic matter, and the synovia being clear and free from inflamma- tory exudation. But, although union of fractures extending into articulations takes place readily enough, it cannot be expected that the patient wnU recover as mobile a joint as if the fracture had merely traversed the shaft. In fact, m the majority of these cases, the patient will be left with a joint that is weak, stiff, and painful: and, if in the lower extremity, the limb may be unable to support the weight of the body for some considerable time Possibly also, in many of these instances, an impaired joint wiU be left tlnnugh Me, as the necessaiy and luiavoidable result of the injury, though not un -e- quently unjustly attributed to negligence and want ot skill on the part of the " Tflie occuiTence of Bislocation at the same time as the fracture, and from the same violence that occasions this, often causes great c i cu y to e377 COMPLICATED FRACTURES. Sui-<^eon, as it becomes jieccssaiy to reduce the dislocated joint before the frac- ture is consolidated. In several instances of this description which ha-s'e fallen under my care, I have succeeded in reducing the dislocation at once, by putting- up the limb very tightly in wooden splints, so as to give a degree of solidity to it, and to permit the lever-like movement of the shaft of the bone to be em- ployed ; and then, putting the patient under chloroform, I have replaced the boim without much difficulty. Should the Surgeon have omitted to reduce the dislocation in the first instance, he must wait until the fracture has become firmly united, and then, putting the limb in splints or in starch, he may try to effect rediTction, which, however, will then be very difficult. The fracture in a limb which is the seat of an old Unreduced Dislocation is necessarily of veiy rare occun-ence, but occasions no serious difficulty in diagnosis or treatment. I once srav and treated successfully with Dr. Bryant a case of this kind in the person of an old gentleman who, falling on the ice, frac timed the left humerus, which had been the seat of an um-educed dislocation forwards for more than fifty years. The e.xistence of an Ankylosed Joint in a fractured limb gives but little trouble, beyond the necessity of modifying the splints in such a way as to fit the shape of the limb. I have treated ft-actiu’es of the thigh, leg, and arm in such circumstances with perfect success, by adapting the splints to the angle formed by the stiffened joint. Fracture of a bone into the Site of an Excised Joint presents no pecu- liarity of importance. I have met with it in the humerus at the elbow, and have treated the case as one of ordinary fracture of the epiphysis. Fracture of the bone in the Stump of an Amputated Iiimb is a rare accident. I have twice had such cases under my care ; once in a man, and another time in a woman, each of whom fr-actured the femur low down in a limb which had been amputated below the knee. There was no displacement of the fractured bone in either case, showing the influence of the weight of the limb in addition to muscular contraction in occasioning displacement of the lou er fragment. In each case the accident was the consequence of a fall, and union readily took place imder the starched bandage. In cases of simple fracture occiuTing in the neighbourhood of, or implicating laige joints, passive motion is very commonly recommended at the end of from foui to six weeks ; I think, however, iifith Vincent, that this is often apt to do moie harm than good, and is seldom required, the natural action of the muscles of the part being fully sufficient to restore the movements of the articulation, with the assistance of fr-iction and douches. A“iputation is but veiy seldom required in simple fractures, and I have never had occasion to practise it. Yet, in cases of very extensive and severe comminuted simple fi-acture of the lower end of the femur, or of the upper part of the bones of the leg, with implication of the knee-joint and injury to ^ e popliteal or tibial arteries, as indicated by the cessation of pulsation in the ■vesse s of the foot, removal of the limb might be proper, in order to save the pa lent from gangrene or diffused traumatic aneurism. But it is only when e mam artery has been injured by spicula of fractured bone, that such iractures inll require amputation. I have had under my care a man in whom the condyles of both femora and the left patella were crushed into378 FRACTURES. numerous liioccs by a tall from a <>Teafc height on both knees, the limbs feeling- like bags of loose fragments of bone at the seat of the injiu-y ; yet, as neither the skin was broken nor the A'essels injured, though lioth knee- joints appeared to be disorganised, the limbs were preserved, and good union ensued. Compound Feactuku.—A compouud fr-acture is that form of injury in which there^is aii open Avouiid leading down to the broken bone, at the seat of fracture. This injmy is not only far more tedious in its cure than simple fracture, but infinitely more dangerous. The tediousness depends upon the communication of the fr-acture Avith the external air, causing it to unite by a sloAv process of granulation, instead of by the more speedy adhesive action that ocem-s in the simple form of injury. The danger is likewise partly due to the same cause ; the process of granulation and suppination being often attended by profuse discharge of pus fr-om abscesses, by long-continued exfoliation of bone, or by the supervention of secondary disease, such as hectic, phlebitis, pyaemia, or erysipelas, so as to lead to the eventual loss of limb or life. Besides these dangers, AA^hich may be looked upon as indirect, the violence that occasions a compound fractm-e often shatters the limb to sueh an extent, as to lead to the immediate supervention of traumatic gangrene, to the loss of life by haemorrhage, or to the certain and speedy disorganisation of the limb, as the consequence of the reactionary inflammation. Question of Amputation.—^As, therefore, compomrd fr-actine is attended not only by great prospectfr'e dangers, but also by serious immediate risk, the fii’st question that ahvays presents itself in a case of this injury is, AA^hether the limb should be removed, or an attempt be made to save it. It is of great importance to settle this point at once ; for, if amputation be determined upon, it should be done Avith as little delay as possible, there being no period in the progress of the case so favom-able for operation as the fii'st foin-and- twenty horns. Should an injudicious attempt have been made at saA-ing the limb, the Sm-geon must wait until suppnratiA-e action has been set up before he can remove it; and then, he will very commonly find that the occinrence of some of the diffuse inflammatory affections of an erysipelatous character Avill render any operation impracticable ; or the siqDervention of traumatic gangrene may compel him to amputate in the most unfavourable circiun- stances. At a late period in the progress of the case, amputation may be required, in order to rid the patient of a necrosed and suppinating limb that is exhausting him by hectic. It is true that primary amputations are very commonly fatal, especially Avhen practised near the trunk ; yet this caimot Avith justice be urged as an argument against their performance, as recourse should never be had to 2}rimarii mnputation except in cases in which it is evident that the patient’s fife must in all probability be sacrificed by the misuccessftfl attempt to saA'e the limb. In determining the cases in Avhich immediate amputation should be performed, no A’ery definite rules can be laid doAvn, and much must at last be left to the indiAddiAal judgment and experience of the Singeon. One will attemijt to save a limb Avhich another condemns. But, in coming to a conclusion upon this imiAortant question, he must beai’ in mind that, though it is imperative to do CA’orything in his power to save a limb, yet the preservation of a patient sCOMP Lie A TED FRA C TV REE 379 life is the main point, and that coiu’sc is the proper one which offers the oTcatest prospect of effecting this, A wise conservatism is much to be ap- planded, but decision in determining the expediency of amputation is equally characteristic of a good Siugeon. In coming to a conclusion on a question of such A'ital moment as this, he must, consider not only the nature and extent of the fractiue, but the ago, constitution, and habits of the patient; and though he may be guided by those general rules Avhich liaA^e already been laid down at pp. and 232, Avhen treating of amputation in contused Avounds and in gun-shot injiuios, yet he Avill often shoAV more Avisdom and a greater amount of skill, in departing from the strict letter of surgical hiAV, and in making a successful effort to saA’O a limb, Avhich, by adherence to surgical precepts, Avould be condemned ; or in attempting to preseiwe the patient’s life, by sacrificing a limb that is not injured to a degree that Avould usually be considered to justify amputation. 1. Those fructiues must be looked uj)on as most luifavoiuable in Avhich the Avouud is the consequence of the A'iolence that breaks the bone, and, in Avhich there is much. Laceration of, and Extravasation into, the Soft Parts ; more particularly if the integuments be stripped off, portions of the muscular belhes protrude, and the planes of areolar tissue betAA'eeu the great muscles of the limb be torn up and infiltrated with blood. lujiuies of this description occmrmg in the lower extremity always require amputation. The danger to the patient increases not only in proportion to the amoiuit of comminution of the bones and of injury to the soft parts, but almost in the exact ratio of the proximity of the injury to the trunk. Thus, amputation of the thigh for bad compound fracture of the leg, though a A^ery serious operation, is sufficiently successful; but Avhen the femur itself is badly fractured and amputation of the thigh high up is required, recovery can indeed but seldom be expected. A bad compoimd fr'actine of the thigh, high up, may almost be looked upon as a fatal accident {vide pp. 105 and 233). In the arm, such accidents are not so serious, and the member may be sa\’ed, unless the bones be greatly conuninuted. 2. The comiAlicatiou of a compound fractine with the Wound of a Large Joint, more especially if there be crushing or splintering of the bones Avhich enter into its formation, AArth extensiA^e laceration of the soft parts, is one of the most serious injuries that can be inflicted on a hmb ; and, when occiuriug in the loAver extremity of the adult, is a case for amputation—unless it be the hip-joint that is damaged, when there Avill generally be so much injury of the pehic boires and their contained viscera, as to preclude the performance of any operation. In children recoA'ery may be effected in cases that Avould be hopeless ui t e adult, and luider antiseptics many limbs, in Ardiich the joints are opened >y lactuie of contiguous bones, ai’e saved that Arme formerly doomed to the ' n c. I^hen the elboAv or the shoulder-joint is the seat of compound com- minuted fracture, Avith extensive injury of the soft parts, and possibly laceration 0 contiguous nerves or largo blood-A'essels, the case is one for immediate ampu- Mion'. But, if the injury bo limited to the boues, tlie soft parts boino- in a favourable state, resection of the articulation may advantageously be practised, -this operation is usually a somoAvhat irregular proceeding, being conducted according to the extent of the wound, and consisting rather in picking out the n Pi'ojecfcing and sharp-pointed ia.^ment&, than in methodical excision.380 FliAG TUBES. A peculiar accidoufc is occasionally met Avith in young people, consisting in a fracture of one of the long bones at the junction of the shaft and epiphysis, and the protrusion of the end of the shaft through the muscles and integuments. In these cases, although the fracture is in close Ticinity to the joint, the articulation is not affected, and careful examination will always prove its sound condition. Ecduction in such cases is clifRcult, and it is usually im- possible to maintain it without sawing off the projecting end of the shaft. This is easily done, and union takes place readily between the epiphysis and the remainder of the shaft. In two instances in which I have had to do this in lads, one near the shoulder, the other near the ankle, an excellent result without impairment of freedom of action in the joint followed the operation. 3. When one of the larger Arteries of the Limb has been wounded by the violence that occasions the fracture, or has been lacerated by the broken bone itself, there may be copious arterial hasmorrhage externally, as well as extravasation into the general areolar tissue of the limb. These cases most commonly require immediate amputation. Whilst the patient is being ex- amined, and preparation made for the operation, dangerous effusion of blood must be carefully prevented by the elevated position and by the application of a tourniquet. For want of this simple precaution, I have seen very large and even fatal quantities of blood gradually lost, by being allowed slowly to trickle from the wound. In these cases it has been proposed, by some Smgeons of great eminence, to enlarge the wound in the Umb, or to make an incision down to the fractm-e, and attempt to tie the artery whore it has been injiued. It is easy to give, but difficult to carry out, such precepts. In most cases they are scarcely practicable, as the Surgeon would have to grope in the midst of bleeding and infiltrated tissues, and Avould experience the greatest possible difficulty in finding the wounded vessel, after a search which would materially tend to increase the disorganisation of the limb. Even after the amputation of a limb in this condition, it is often by no means easy on dissection to find the artery that has poured out blood ; and how much more difficult must it be to search for it successfully during life ! The hgatiue of the artery at a higher point of the limb does not hold out much prospect of success, for the same reasons that render its performance in- admissible in ordinary wounds of arteries (p. 285). This operation has succeeded in restraining hsemoiThage or in cming diffused tramnatic aneurism in simple fractines. But I know of no case in which it has been successful in the permanent arrest of immanj haemorrhage in a compound fi’actine. If, then, proper means directed to the woimd, such as position, pressme, or perhaps the attempt at ligatirre if the artery can be easily reached, be not successM, no coiu’se is left to the Singeon but to amputate the limb without delay. _ Tins is more especially the case if it be the lower extremity that is injincd : m the arm, there is a better prospect of our being able to arrest the bleeding v 1 ou having recom’se to this extreme measure.

Here the case is \'ery different from what occiu's in similar circumstances in a simple fracture. Extensive sui^pura- tion will set in : the siffinters, if completely or nearly detached, will lose their vitality, and not only produce all the irritation that would result from the inclusion of rough and pointed foreign bodies in the interior of a limb, but, if numerous, will, on their removal or separation, leave the member shortened and permanently deformed. The treatment of such cases 'will depend on the seat of the injury, and the extent of the communition. Compomid and com- minuted fr-actiu’cs of the femur, may, except when ocemring in the upper third, generally be looked upon as cases for immediate amputation (vide p. 379) ; the only other exceptions being when the comminution is trifling, the splinters large, and lying in the axis of the bone, and the subject young. In the aiun, fore- arm, and hand, and in the leg, provided the knee and ankle-joints be not involved, much may be done in the way of removing splinters of detached bone, and sawing off smoothly the rugged ends of the fixed fragments. The larger- attached and “secondary” pieces should be left, as they wiU thi’ow out callus, and become buttresses of support to the broken bone (vide p. 361). If a con- siderable quantity of sphntered bone have been extracted from a limb, care must be taken that in putting up the fracture too complete extension is not maintained, lest a gap be left, which cannot be filled up by new bone, and a v eakened hmb result. It is better to place the bones in proper apposition, and to let the patient recover with a shortened but strong and otherwise useful hmb. 5. The compheation of a bad Compound Fracture requiring Amputation low down in a Limb, with, a Simple Fracture high up, is a serious one. The question that will here arise is : Should the amputation be performed above the compound and below the simple fr-acture, or above both ? The answer to this must depend on the condition of the hmb between the fr-actures. Suppose that there be a badly comminuted and compound fr-actme of the lower third of the leg, with a simple fractm-e of the middle of the thigh ; or a crush of the hand or fore-arm, with simple fractm-e of the middle of the humerus • how should the Surgeon act ? It appears to me that the proper course to adopt in such a case as this, would mainly depend on the conditions of the inter- mediate soft parts. If these be somid, free fr-om extravasation, not contused or lacerated, the hmb may vath safety be removed just above the lower fractm-e the upper fr-acture bemg treated on ordinary principles. But if there be exten- Mve rinsing o ^ the hmb -with ecchymosis or deep extravasation between the ac ines, then it would clearly be useless to amputate low down, as not only fl ^ ^ formed of tissues in a state of disorganisation, but sfruch!rTi^Tr^ into the extravasation, and, setting up unhealthy suppm-ation in ese, you d spread upwards to the higher fr-acture, converting it into a com- pomi one of the worst kind. In such cases, therefore, where there is extensive murfoTttV* 60ft pa-tB, it appears to me that the toiJer C. The compheation of a Dislocation high up with a had CompoundFRACTURES. Fracture low down, as when the shoulder is dislocated, and the hand is crushed, is not so serious ; the dislocation having been reduced, the limb may be amputated low down with safety. This practiee I had occasion to adopt some years since in a young man who met with a bad crush of the hand and fore-arm, with dislocation of the humerus into the axilla, in conscf|ucncc of the limb having become entangled in machinery. It; however, the compound fractiue, raiattended by any of the complications that have just been mentioned, occur in a young or otherwise healthy subject, we must, of course, attempt to save the limb, and shall generally succeed in doing so. TuEATJiEJfT OF CoMPouED Fractueb.—Ill the management of a compound fractm-e, more especially of the lower extremity, special apparatus, such as iMTiitp-e’s, Liston’s, or the bracket-splints, double inclined planes, swing-boxes, and fractm-e-beds, are often necessary, in order to obtain access to the wound, so as to dress it properly, and to place the limb in the best position for union. In many cases the starched or plaster bandage may very advantageously be used ; but it requires caution, as swelling and consequent strangidation of the limb may take place under it. There ai’e several points that require special attention. These are : 1, the Reduction and the Management of any Protruding Bone ; 2, the Management of Sphnters ; 3, the Closure of the Wound ; and 4, the Subduing Consecutive Inflammation. It is in carrying out these indications that the whole treatment of the injuries is involved, in those cases in which the limb admits of being- saved. The Reduction of compound fractures must be accomplished uuth the same attention to care and gentleness as in that of simple ones. In the majority of cases, no great difficulty is experienced; and after reduction, the hmb should be placed on a Avell-padded splint, properly protected in the neighbom-hood of the wound until oiled silk, so as to prevent soiling of the pads by blood and discharge. In some cases, however, considerable difficulty arises in the reduc- tion, from the protrusion of one of the broken fragments which has been driven through the skin, at the time of the accident or by careless handling of the limb in canying the jiatient, or else by the muscular contractions di-agging the lower fr-agment forcibly upwards, and thus causing perforation of the integu- ment. The protrudeci bone must, if possible, be gently replaced, by relaxing the muscles of the limb, and then bringmg the soft parts over it. Sometimes, however, it is so tightly embraced by the sldn, which appears to be doubled in underneath, that enlargement of the wound becomes necessary before it can be replaced. In other cases, again, reduction cannot be effected or maintained, unless the sharp and projecting point of bone be sawn off. This is best done with an ordinary amputating saiv, the neighboiming soft parts being protected with a split card ; or else by passing the blade of a Butcher’s saw under the bone and cutting upwards. The limb, as I have found in several cases inAvhich it has been necessary to have recourse to this procedure, is not ultimately Aveakened or necessarily shortened by it. After the reduction, the great object is, if possible, to convert the compomid into a simple fractime by the closure of the external -wound. No pains should bo neglected to effect this desirable end. If it can be accomplished, the tediousness and dano-er of the case are greatly lessened ; the patient being savedTREATMENT OF COMPOUND FRACTURE. 383 trom the whole process of suppuration, with all its attendant e’S'ils. But the chance of closing the wound in the soft parts will vary greatly in different cases, depending chiefly on the way in which it has been produced, Avhether by trans- flxioii of the skin by the shaiiD angular fragment, or by the direct violence which has occasioned the fracture. If the Avound be small, clean cut, and occasioned by the protrusion of the fi’agmcnt rather than by the direct violence Avhich occasioned the fracture, aa'C may hope to succeed in our oliject byfolloAV- ing Sir A. Cooper’s recommendation of applying to it a piece of lint soaked in blood, or, AA’hat is better, satimatcd with collodion or Avith tincture of benzoin, and thus obtaining union by direct adhesion. The dressing should be left un- distmhed until it loosens of itself, at the end of a Aveek or tAAm, when the Avound Avill probably be found to be closed. With the double object of closing the Avound and of prcA'enting decomposition of its fluids by the entrance of organisms floating in the air. Lister recommends the employment of the antiseptic method (p. 198), from AAdiich good results haA'e been obtained. If the A\nund be large and lacerated, if a joint haA'e been opened, if the AAnimd have been inflicted by the same violence that has broken the bone, or if there be much bruising of the edges and suiToimding tissues, Avith extravasation into the limb, suppuration must necessarily ensue, and thus direct union camiot be expected to take place. In these chcumstances, it is in accordance Avith the best principles of surgery, not to folloAv the routine practice of attempting to close the wound, which can- not possibly unite by the flrst intention, but to treat it like auy other contused wound, and apply carbolised Avater-dressing from the very fli-st, so as to allow a Aunt for the discharges that will take place after the first four-and-tAventy hoirrs. If these be retained in the hmb by the external wound being kept closed by any dressing, Avhatever its natiue may be, deep infiltration of the areolar inter- muscular planes aaoU ensue, Avith much local tension and purulent infiltration, accompanied by scAcre constitutional irritation, followed probably by pyrnmia. It is, I believe, in consequence of the free Aunt thus afforded to the discharges, and of their retention being avoided, that many of the AAurst-looking cases of compound fracture—especially of the leg—those in Avhich there has been ex- tensive sloughing of the soft parts aroimd the Avomid, mth exposiue of the fiactured fragments, eventually do the best. The danger in such cases is a remote one, from hectic and exhaustion ; not an immediate and graA'e one, fiom erysipelas and purulent absorption, or septic poisoning, resulting from the infiltration of the limb. After the position of the limb and the management of the external wound have been attended to, an endeavour must be made to moderate the local in- flammatory action, and to lessen constitutional irritation. This is best effected by leaving the part undisturbed and untouched as long as jiossible. The great art in the successful treatment of compound fractures consists in not dis- tuibing the limb or meddhngAvith the Avound. Bor days or eA'oii AAueks the limb may sometimes advantageously be left AAdthout interference, AA'hen once it has leen carefully put up. Should, liOAveAnr, much SArelling haA'e taken jilacc and the wound show no disposition to heal by the first intention, but become inflamed and sloughy, and should much inflammatory action be set up in the limb' tluk may be moderated by in-igation (Fig. G9), and by the application of cold evano- latmg lotions. The part should be elevated and but lightly covered, the bid-FRACTURES. 384 clothes being well raised by means of 'a cradle, so as not to press on the limb, and to allow space for the evaporation of the cold lotion ; care being taken, at the same time, that the bandages bo applied very loosely, merely with a suhicient degree of force to retain the limb upon the splint, as inflammatory infiltration, that might rapidly induce strangulation of the part, is apt to ensue. The constitutional irritation must be subdued by the administration of opiates, together ^rith an aperient, on the morning follomng the accident; and those medicines must be repeated from time to time during the fii’st few days. Moderate and cooling regimen must be employed, and the patient be disturbed as little as possible. In many cases suppination rapidly sets in, and. if the patient be addicted to drinking, the constitutional distiuhance soon assumes the inntative form : in these circumstances, it is of great moment that support, and even stimulants, be freely given ; they must be allowed from the very first, and increased in proportion to the depression of the patient’s strength, or as symptoms of nervous irritation come on. If there be much extravasation of blood into the soft parts, and bruising, gi-eat tension of the limb, followed by unhealthy suppination and sloughing, will take place in the neighboinhood of the wound; free incisions are then required to remove the tension and strangulation of the tissues, and, by letting out the broken-down blood and pus, to lessen the risk of the occun-ence of gangrene. It is in these cases that much injiny results from blindly follow- ing as a routine practice in all cases indiscriminately, the treatment which is undoubtedly of the highest value in some ; viz., that of keeping over the wound any impervious dressing, whether antiseptic, plasters, or a pad of lint that has become hard and impermeable by imbibition of dried blood, with a view to closure by the first intention. The natinal vent to the discharge through the external opening being interfered with, deep infiltration takes place through the areolar planes of the limb, and the most extensive local mischief may result, pyaemia being almost certain to ensue. As soon as suppuration is fairly estab- lished, a light poultice or thick oakum water-dressing should be apphed, and the bmTowing of matter prevented by making counter-openings where necessary, by the application of a compress, and by attention to the position of the limb. The fractin’c-apparatus must be kept scrupulously clean, especially in summer ; the bandages changed as often as soiled, and the pads well protected with oiled silk. During this period various compheations, such as erysipelas, infiammation of the absorbents and veins, and low forms of pneumonia, are apt to occm-, requu'ing special consideration and treatment; so also, fr the discharo-e be'abundant, hectic, with its sweats and gastro-intestmal irrita- tion, may come on, requiring frill support of the powers of the system, and the administration of the mineral acids and other remedies, according to circumstances. As the confinement to bed is necessarily very prolonged in these cases, often extending thi’ough many weeks and months, the state of the patient’s back should be attended to, and he should early be placed upon a water-cushion, or hydrostatic bed, lest sores supervene. As the wound gradually heals, water-dressing must be substituted for pou tices, so as parts and encoiuage suppuration, and, in time, the icd 01 blue vas 0 Lter-di’essing. The bone will often be observed lying white and bare, bathed in pus, at the bottom of the wound. But even in this appaiently unfaioiu-TREATMENT OF COMPOUND FRACTURE. 385 iiblc condition, it may recover itself: its vessels gradually depositing lymph in points on its surtace, and tins lymph becoming vascnlariscd, so as to cover the bone with a layer of florid granulations; in other eases, necrosis to a greater or less extent takes place, and perfect consolidation does not occm’ until the bone has separated. Ciuiing has sho-wn that those portions of necrosed bone are slowest in detaching themselves, which are connected with the lower fragment. In some instances a large quantity of proxusional callus is throAvn out, in which the necrosed bone is implicated ; and then the process of separa- tion becomes extremely tedious and protracted, and amputation may not un- commonly become necessaiy, from the powers of the patient being unable to bear up in so prolonged a stniggle. So soon as some consohdation has taken place, the limb should be firmly put up in gutta-percha or leather splints, with a starched bandage, so as to enable the patient to be taken out of bed, to change the air of his room, and thus to keep up his general health. In fitting these splints, care must be taken to make an aperture opposite the woimd, through which it may he dressed (Fig. 143). Xeudbrfer has introduced a dry plaster of Paris dressing for compound frac- tures, especially those produced by gun-shot, and indeed, for aU attended by excessive suppiuation. From this means he derived the best possible results in the German wars of 186‘4 and 1866. His method is as follows. Beneath the seat of injury he places eight layers of hnen cloth, and on this several pounds of dry gypsum are poured, so that it lies under and around the fractiue until there is a wall heaped up on each side of the wound, which is also covered in. The hnen cloths are then brought over like a many- tailed bandage, and the whole is tied up by short lengths of bandage. As the plaster becomes impregnated with pus, it is scraped off, hut the wound is on no account to be meddled with ; new plaster is apphed whez’e the old, which has become pasty, has been removed. Heudorfer states that, when compound ti-acture has been treated by the fixed plaster bandage, this shoidd be generally removed at the end of fourteen days. After this the dry method, as above described, may be ajDplied, and no splint or other extending or containing apparatus is required. It may be observed that, as plaster of Paris does not. set with albuminous fluids, it is not hardened by the pus, but merely absorbs it, becoming pasty. The time required for the proper consolidation of a compound fractui’e 'a^ies greatly, according to the amount of injury done to the bones and soft parts, and the age and constitution of the patient. In the most favoimable circumstances, it requires double or treble the time that is necessaiy for the unipn of a simple fi’actiu’e. Much stiffness of the limb from rigidity of the muscles and tendons wiU continue for a considerable length of time ; this may giadually be removed by fr’ictions and douches. Secondary Amputation may become necessary fr'om the occuiTence of raumatic gangrene, and then it must bo done in accordance with the prin- cip es already laid down when spealdng of that operation ; but more fr-cquently 1 IS required from failure of the powers of the patient in consequence of irrita- nc and asthenic fever, induced by general disorganisation of the hmb or by ICC 1C resulting fr-om profuse suppuration and slow necrosis of the bones. In ese circumstances, the constitution sufiers from the local irritation which is c cFli AC TUBES. 386 the source of the wasting discharge : but, hy removing this in time, and seizing an interval in which constitutional action may have been somewhat lessened, the patient’s life will in all probability be preser\’ed ; the results of secondary amputation for compound fractiu’e in these conditions being by no means unfavourable. Indeed, it is remarkable to see how speedily the con- stitutional irritative and hectic symptoms subside after the removal of the som-ce of irritation ; the patient often sleeping well, and taking his food with appetite the day after the operation. The proper period to seize for the performance of secondary amputation in the earlier stages of the injiny is often a most critieal point. As a general rule, it may be stated that, if the limb be not removed dmlng the hrst twenty- four hours, eight or ten days must be allowed to elapse before the operation is done ; as during that time constitutional irritation and suppimative fever are too general and active to render fresh shock to the system admissible. But when once the actions appear to tend to locahse themselves, the suppm’ation becoming more abundant, the redness extending but slowly, and the constitu- tional symptoms merging into an asthenic form, then the limb may be removed with the best prospect of success. The more the action is locahsed, the greater is the chance of the operation succeeding. In many cases the symptomatic and suppm’ative fever so rapidly becomes asthenic, that the Sm’geon must seize the best moment he can for amputation. In these circumstances the operation is seldom very successful; the stimip becomes sloughy, erysipelas or dilfuse inflammation of the areolar tissue comes on, or symptoms of pyremia set in, and the patient speedily dies. In other- cases again, between the stages of the inflammatoi-y and suppmative fever and the supervention of the typhoid symptoms, there is a marked interval of twelve or twenty-foiu- horns, or even more. During this, the mischief may be looked upon as in a great measme of local character; the constitution has been distm-bed by the setting up of the inflammatory action, but, this having terminated in suppuration, it has not yet become seriously depressed by the continued irritation of the discharge from the injm-ed hmb, or poisoned by the absorption of morbid matters from it. The patient’s powers must not, however, be allowed to sink to the last ebb before amputation is performed ; as then, if the shock do not destroy life, intercmTent and visceral congestion, or some low form of inflammatory mis- chief, win not improbably prove fatal. Much as “ consei-vative ” siu-gery is to be admii-ed and cultivated, and hasty or unnecessary operation to be depre- cated, I cannot but think that the hfe of the patient is occasionally jeopardised, and even lost, by disinclination on the part of the Surgeon to operate sufii- ciently early in cases of compound fractme, and by too prolonged attempts at saving the injm-ed limb. The success of the operation -ttull in a great measure depend upon the after- treedment. Large quantities of stimulants and support arc often required in London practice to prevent the patient fr-om sinking. I have fr-cquently given with the best results, eight or ten ounces of brandy, twelve or sixteen of port wine, or two or thi-ee pints of porter, in the twenty-fom- horns alter these operations, with beef-tea, arrow-root, or meat, if the patient would take it, and have found it absolutely necessary to do so to obviate death fr-om exhaustion.IIE-BUEAKING OF BONES. 387 At a later period, when some weeks or months have elapsed, and the fracture has not united, the bones arc necrosing, and the patient is being Avorn out by hectic, amputation must be performed at any convenient moment, and is often done with great success if it be not deferred till too late ; for here tlic mischief is entirely local, and the constitution, suffering only by the debihty resulting from it, quickly rallies when the cause of this is removed, Bexdijcg, Rebkkakii^g, Resetting Bones.—It may happen, that at the end of two or three weeks a fractiu'ed bone is found in a position too faulty to be remedied by the natural process just described. At this period the bond of union is soft and yielding, and the displacement, if angular, may usually be remedied by frequent re-adjustment of the apparatus, and more particularly by bandaging the fr-actured fragments in opposite directions, or by the use of pads and pressure thus exercised on the extremities of the broken bones. If this period be allowed to pass by, and the fractiu’e be allowed to become con- sohdated, it may be found to be so ladly set that it is necessary to forcibly Eig. 140.—Butclier’s Clamp for Re-fractuviug Badly Set Bone. lend or break the caUus, in order to improve the condition of the limb. When the displacement is angular, and the consohdation not very finn, as is usuaUy he case, this may be done readily enough ; but if the displacement be longi- ina , an much time have, elapsed since the occurrence of the injury, it will bo difficult not impossible, to remove the defoimity.

But should several mouths have elapsed since the consolidation, the unaided strength wiU not prove sufficient. In such cases, Butcher has successfully employed a siu’gical clamp (Fig. 140), by the prcssiu’e of Avhich the bone may be broken across at its displaced angle, even though the faulty union is of several months’ duration. Should the consolidation of the fractm’e be too firm to admit of re-bending, or re-breaking, subcitiamous osteotomy may be employed in some cases with advantage. The best instrument for use is Adams’s narrow-bladed saw. With this I have divided the fibula in badly set Pott’s fracture, where the bone had united at an angle pointing inwards, and thus throA\ung the outer edge of the foot upwards. The same operation may be applied to other bones, especially to those of the fore-arm. A bone which does not appear to have been very skilfully sot, and which presents a certain amount of deformity when the splints or apparatus covering it are removed, may gradually regain its proper shape if left to itself. This it does by the muscles of the limb moulding the callus whilst still somewhat soft and yielding into a proper shape. The callus may be quite strong enough to bear the weight and to maintain the length of the limb in its full integiity after the removal of aU apparatus, and yet be sufficiently yielding to become slowly and gradually shaped by the action of the muscles of the limb when they are left untrammelled by bandages. But it more commonly happens that a limb which, when taken out of the splints at the proper period, appears to be straight and of good length, gradually yields imder the weight of the body and the strain of the muscles : ■ so that, at the end of a few weeks, great and most unsightly deformity occurs. In these cases the Singeon is often unduly blamedand to his imskilfidness is attributed that displacement which, in reality, is due to the faulty character of the callus. It must be remembered that there is every degree of firmness of the callus, from that which is of noimal consistence to^^that which is quite unable to support the weight of the lunb or body, and that yields more or less quickly under the pressure to which it is subjected. . , i-i.i Delayed Union.—Occasionally, more particularly in cases of fractine of the femur, tibia, and humerus, the union between the broken fragments is Mayetl several weeks beyond the usual period of perfect consolidation. This arises, in the majority of cases, from constitutional debility, rather than from local causes. Several cases of delayed union have been recorded in which repam readily took place after the employment of merciny. Indeed, in sypFihtic subje^s the constitutional taint should always be treated. A not unfieqiient cause of delayed union is “mededing” with the fractine, c^nging tus removing splints or frequently testing the sohdity. men it is found . heeSffinof six or eight weeks after the occmrence of simple ftnctine thatTLalliis is still yielding, the general health should change of air, &c., and the limb securely put up in ^^arched o plater ot . bandte^cs Indeed, I believe that delayed union is much less likelj to occiii oanaa^^cs. ii , treated by the starohed bandage, and patients who have from the first been tiearou Lwed to more about, than in those uho have been oouflued to bod oi .athci to the house in the ordinary way.UNUNITED FRAGTUEE AND FALSE JOINT. 389 Unuxitkd Fractures and False Joints.—Some bones, when broken, ver}' rarely unite by callus or plastic inatter, their fragments merely being kept firm by the intervention of the aponeimotic structures of the part, as is the case with the patella. This, which is mving to a want of apposition of the fragments, and is dependent on the condition of the part, cannot be considered a diseased action. It occasionally happens, however, in fractures of the shafts or of the articu- lar ends of long bones, that proper union does not take place. This may be owing to one of four circumstances. 1. No uniting material of a stronger kind than a loose fibro-cellular tissue has been formed ; 2. The plastic matter that has been thrmvn out has only developed into fibrous tissue, not having undergone osseous transformation ; 3. True bony union has taken place, but, ovung to some peculiar state of the patient’s health, the callus has become absorbed, and the fracture loosened ; or, 4, The fragments may be so mdely sej)arated that no uniting material could form. In the first and third conditions we have an Ununited Fracture; the ends of the bone, which are roiuided and eburiiated, being merely connected by, and enveloped in, a loose fibro-cellular tissue. In the second condition we have a False Joint, the ends of the bone being- tied together by strong fibrous bands. The structiu-e of these false joints, Avhich has been carefully studied by Eokitansky, presents two distinct varieties. In the fii’st, which partakes of the character of a hinge-joint, we find that the ends of the fractm-e are smoothed and rounded, invested with a dense fibrous periosteum, and united to one another by thick bands of ligamentous tissue, in such a way as usually to admit of considerable lateral movement, though sometimes they are tolerably firm. In the other variety the joint partakes of the baU-and-socket character, usnally to a very imperfect degree, but sometimes in a sufficiently well developed mannei’, one end of the bone being rounded and invested by a periosteum, the other cup-shaped, and covered by firm smooth fibroid tissue. The bones are united by a kind of capsule, in Avhich a S}Tioiaa-like fluid has occasionally been found. The foim that the false joint will assume depends on the action of the muscles which influence it. Thus, when occurring in the shafts of long bones, where it is subjected to movements of flexion and extension, it vull assume the hinge-foim; whilst, when it is seated in the articular ends, where it is more subjected to movements of rotation, it will affect the ball-and-socket character. Non-union of fracture, whether resulting in false joint or in ordinary ununited fractiue, is undoubtedly very rare. I have very seldom met with it in my ovn practice. The cases that have been under my care at University College Hospital have almost all been sent up from various parts of the country, and probably present but a very small proportion of the fr-actures that have occurred in the districts fr’om which they have been sent. We probably exaggerate the frecjnency of non-union, if we say that it occurs in the proportion of one in a thousand cases of fr-acture of the limbs. ancuS^'^^^^° ununited fracture and of false joint are constitutional In some cases the Constitutional Cause appears to be a cachectic state ofFRACTURES. 390 the system^ occurring from some diseases, such as fever, scurvy, sj'philis, or cancer, or from any depressing influence, in consequence of which there is not sufficient reparative power for the production or proper development of the plastic matter, by which the fracture should be united. If this have been deposited, it may, under the influence of these constitutional causes, again become absorbed, and the fr-acturc may thus be loosened. But mere debility, ! independently of blood cachexy, will not lead to want of union in a fracture. In fact, in many very weakly children, the scrofulous or phthisical, fractures ■will unite vuth the greatest readiness, and if union be delayed for a short time it will, on the restoration of health, readily take place. Indeed, the causes that independently of local conditions, lead to non-union of a fr-actimed bone, are most obscure. In many cases no constitutional cause for the want of union can be detected, the patient being in excellent health, strong, and robust. In spontaneous fr-actures, union seldom takes place very readily or perfectly. Pregnancy is said to have a tendency to interfere vrith the proper union of a fractiu’e ; this, however, I consider doubtful, as I have had under my care, and have seen, a considerable number of cases of fr’acture in pregnant women, Avhich united in the ordinary time. BiUroth has made a similar observation. Age.—Failure of union in fr’actirres is very rare in children, and when it occurs in them is seldom remediable, unless it be the result of neglect or of improper mechanical treatment. It is more common at the earlier adult and middle ages. Union -will readily occur in aged individuals. Indeed, advanced age appears to exercise no adverse influence on the repair of fractirres. I have on two occasions, in my own practice, knoAvn very Arm and perfect consohda- tion of fr-actm-c of the shaft of the femur to take place in women of ninety years of age and upwards. The Local Causes are various and important. The anatomical condition of the fragments, as regards their vascular supply, is perhaps that on which Avant of union is most immediately dependent. For proper union to take place, it is necessary that the callus be deposited from both sides of the fr’actmu. If one fragment be so situated that sufficient blood is not sent to it for this purpose, not only may want of union, but necrosis, occur. This is exemplifled in fr’actures of the superior articular ends of the humerus and femiu. In intra- capsular fractiu'e of the anatomical neck of the hinnerus, the globular head, being detached from all its vasetdar connections, may necrose. In intra- capsular fractiu'e of the neck of the femur, the head oi the bone, still retaining some vascular connection through the medium of the ligamentum teies, has "sufficient blood furnished to it to prevent its death, but not enough to foim callus—hence fibrous union takes place. In the shafts of the long bones, the ^ degree of union will be dependent in a great measure on the conditions ot the . vascular supply to the fr-agments, through the medium of the nutritious ai'tery. The influence of the ruptinc of the nutritious artery of the bone by the hue of fracture rumiing across it, and thus interfering with the vascular supply of one of the fragments, has been investigated by Gueretin; and the occasiona occniTence of atrophy of the bone after fracture, has been shovn by Cu'iling to ( be dependent upon the inteiTuption of the supply of arterial blood throng iTREATMENT OF UNUNITED FRACTURE. 391 this vessel. He states that the portion of bone below the entrance of the nutritions arteiy, or on that side of the foramen towards which the blood flows, beins deprived its proper vascnlar supply, undergoes certain changes ; the medifllaiy canal becoming expanded and the osseous tissue less dense. Gueretin has collected cases that tend to prove the direct connection between the occiu’- rence of nnnnited fractime, and the want of proper arterial supply to one of the fragments. Thus, in the humerus the course of the nutritious artery is ft'07n above downwards ; and of thirteen cases of nnunited fractm-e, nine were found to be situated above the canal in which the vessel is lodged. In the fore-arm, Avhere the nutritions artery passes from below upwards, of eight cases of uuunited ft’acture, seven occurred below this vessel, and only one above. Adams, has, however, shown that the number and size, as well as position, of the nutrient arteries, vary considerably ; and hence the objection that non-union may occur in a fracture of any part of the shaft of a long bone. whereas the nutritions artery is only found at one spot, can scarcely be con- sidered a veiy '^'alid one. Smne lones are mticJi more Halle than others to disunion of their fractures. According to the statistics collected by Horris, it would appear that the femm-, the humerus, the bones of the leg, and of the forearm, and lastly the lower jaw, are those in which imunited fractures most frequently occiu’, and that in the order which has been given. Hamilton states that in his experience the humeiTis is more commonly the seat of an ununited fracture than the femur ; and my experience agrees with his. One cause that may operate in leading to want of union in a fracture is the application of a landage directly and too tightly to the hmb. When this is done, the vasciflar supply to the broken bone is strangled, the muscles and soft textmes want nutrition, and consequently, a fortiori, reparative actions are inter- fered with, and callus is not formed of proper consistence or in sufficient quan- tity for consohdation of the fracture. The occmnence of imunited fractine is occasionally attributed to the molility or v:ant of pn'cper ccpposition of the fragments which are so situated that, instead of the broken surfaces being in contact, rotation of the limb has caused the outer and periosteal aspects to touch. Doubtless, in some cases, it may be so occasioned ; but I believe that these causes are not nearly so frequent in their operation as the constitutional and local conditions that have afready been pointed out. The interposition of apiece of muscle between the fragments may prei ent union. Of this I saw an interesting instance some years ago, in which Mant of union in a fractured femur was oiving to the perforation of the vastus muscle by the upper fragment, and its entanglement betiveen the broken ends, hut it is very certain that, to whatever condition, local or constitutional, non- xmion of a fracture may be due, it is in very many cases quite impossible to assi.gn to it any cause appreciable by the Simgeon. 1 he Treatment of nnunited fracture must not be conducted by local means only; constitutional measures should not be neglected. We cannot expect the formation of firm and strong callus unless the general health be in a satisfactory state. If callus have not been formed, or if; after formation, it have lieen absorbed under the influence of a cachectic state of the system, the improvement of the patient’s health, at the same time that the fracture is put392 FRACTURES. up again fiimly, so that the ends of the bone are l^roiight into close aiiposition, may bring about perfect union. In some instances of unmiited fracture or delayed union m syphilitic subjects, union speedily takes place after the admi- mstration of some preparation of mercury or iodide of potassium, according to stage of the constitutional affection. I have had imder my care at the Hos- pital, a man wffh ununited fracture of the femiu- from absorption of the callus foiu’ months after the occim-ence of the injmy, under the influence of incipient phthisis and debility induced by want of food : perfect consolidation of the fr-acture was produced by giving him cod-liver oil and good diet, with rest in bed and a starched bandage to the hmb. Hence it is evident that impaired nutrition may preAmnt union, even after callus has been deposited, and that improvement of the nutritive activity of the body may of itself lead to consolidation of the fragments. If there be no very evident cause for the Avaut of union, it will occasionally suffice to put up the fr-actine fii-mly in leather or gutta-percha splmts, mth a starched bandage, and then to allow the patient to move about upon crutches, so that his general health may not suffer, at the same time that a tonic plan of treatment is followed. I have seen several cases in which the want of union appeared to have resulted fr-om too long confinement of the patient to his bed, and the consequent impairment of his health, consolidation taking place when a more favoimible hygienic system was enforced. This simple plan can, however, only be useful if but a short time, at most some months, have elapsed from the occiuTence of the injiny. In some cases, the empirical administration of meremy is attended with success. In a case of immiited fr-actine of the humerus that was admitted into the Uni- versity College Hospital under Liston, fifteen weeks after the occiuTence of the injiuy, union was induced AAuthin a month by putting up the limb in splints, and salivating the patient. When the Avant of luiion arises fr’om malignant disease, nothmg can be done. At the same time, with appropriate constitutional treatment, suitable local means must be employed to secine steady coaptation of the fragments. In the upper extremity, this may usually be done by means of splints of an ordinary character. In the leg, the starched or plaster of Paris bandage Avill be found to be especially serviceable. In the case of ununited fracture of the thigh, special apparatus AviU be required to seciue complete fixity and steadiness of the hmb. For this pm-pose, the limb should be put in an apparatus, consisting of an outer and an imier iron rod haAung hinge-joints opposite the hip and ankle, and attached above to a strong pelvic band, and below to the sole of the boot. The thigh part should be provided with Avell-padded splints, which may be scrcAA'ed down in opposite dhections against the two fr-agments, so as to hold them fh-mly in contact. This instrument should be worn for several months ; and by it Smith, of Philadelphia, has succeeded in cming ten out of fourteen un- united fractures in the lower extremity. One great reconunendation is, that this plan of treatment is entirely devoid of danger, and enables the patient to take exercise whilst under treatment. In cases Avhere there are much shorten- ing of the limb and riding of the fr-agments, Avhich are especially apt to occur in the thigh, it Avill be necessary to employ extension of the limb as aa ell as compression of the fragments against one another. This extension may be made by the lateral hon rods of the above-described apparatus being con-TREATMENT OF FALSE JOINT. 393 structed so as to slide, by means of a rack-and-pinion oi by whicli the limb may be gradually lengthened to any required extent (Fig. 147). ■When the failure of union has become very chronic, and a False Joint has been formed, it vill be necessary to employ operative procedure betore union can be attained. All operations that are undertaken in these cases are conducted on one of tvo principles ; either, 1, to excite such inflammation in the false joint and the neigh- bouring tissues, as vdll lead to the formation of lymph capable of undergoing osseous transformation ; or else, 2, hij removing the false joint altogether, to convert the case into a recent compomid fractiu'e, and to treat it as such an accident. It can be easily understood that operative screw mechanism. Fig. 147. — ApiiiU'atUii for Uuunited Fracture of Femur. have known union effected in a patient of Liston’s, who had a false joint in the shaft of the femm ; though not until after the fractiu’e had been converted into a compomid one, and much danger and suffering incui-red. Foiu- years after the consolidation of the ununited fi’actiu’e, the patient was readmitted into the Hospital, mider my care, with fractiu-e of the same bone two inches lower down than the former injury ; on this occasion, union took place in the usual manner and time without any difficulty. The introduction of a seton across the false joint, though occasionally successful, is apt to give rise to dangerous and even fatal results, from arterial haemoiThage, erysipelas, diffuse inflammation, and suppuration of the limb. The threads must not be left in beyond a few days, when sufficient action wiU have been induced. A modifleatiou of the seton consists in passing a silver wire around the fracture, and gradually tightening this, so ,as to cut through the false joint at the same time that iiiflammatory action is excited in it. In performing this operation, it must be borne in mind that large arterial branches, and even the main trunk, especially in the thigh, may become firmly attached to the callus, so that unless care be taken they may readily be wounded. Dieffenbach has proposed to excite the requisite degree of inflammation by driving, with, a mallet, thi’ee or four conical ivory pegs into holes bored by means of a gimlet or drill into the ends of the fr-actm-od bone, which are exposed for this pmqiose. The awd, or drill, may be wmrked wflth the Archi- medean screw, and will then be found to penetrate much more easily. Points procediu-es conducted on these principles are too serious to be lightly undertaken, or to be had recom’se to until other measimes have failed, the mortality following them being, even according to public statistics, considerable, and probably very much greater than has been laid before the profession. 1. Among the first set of operations,—those that have in view the Excitation of sufficient Inflammation to cause Deposit of proper Plastic Matter, —the simplest procedme consists in the introduction of acupuncture needles, or in the subcutaneous section of the ligamentous band with a tenotome. In this Avay I394 I'll AG TUBES. 0 laia cLown, and alter a few weeks the pegs, M'hich have loosened in consequence of the re- moval or absorption of their ends, should be taken out. It is not necessary or even de- sirable to attempt to pin together the ends of the broken bone, but merely to introduce the pegs into the extremities of both fragments near to the seat of fracture. It is, however, especially in ununited fr’actures of the humerus that this can be successfully done, the irritation of the pegs appearing to occasion an eiiusion of a large quantity of callus suffi- cient for the consolidation of the fractme. This operation I have practised ■with great success in several instances of ununited fracture of this bone. In one case that was under my care, there was a false joint at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the bone, complicated ■\nth an elbow ankylosed in the straight position ; here, after flexion of the stiff elbow, perfect consolida- tion of the hiunems "^^ns effected by the use of five pins. In the ununited fractures of the bones of the leg and forearm, it is also likely to be seiwiceable, but in the femim not so much so. Indeed, in the cases of unimited fracture of this bone, I have known more failures than successes after this operation. 2. The operation of Removing the False Joint may be performed by cutting down upon it, and resecting the ends of the bones, or else by destroying the articulation with caustic potash. The excision of a false joint is necessarily dangerous, and by no means successful ; erysipelas, pldebitis, and diffuse sup- puration of the bone, occasionally supeiTening. It shordd only be done when there is much overlapping of the fragments. Of thirty-nine cases collected by Norris, in which the ends of the bones were either resected or scraped, twenty- four were cured, seven derived no benefit, and six died. In those cases of the operation that are successful, some shortening of the limb must be expected to result; and, if the fractme be very oblique, it will of comse be impossible to remoA'e more than a very limited portion of bone, and, consequently, very perfect nrrion can scarcely be anticipated. The application of caustics to the exposed bones is so coarse and imcertain a method as to find but little favom* amongst Smgeons of the present day. Professor Nussbaum, of Munich, has ulna was lost as the result of a gunshot injiny. A shell of bone and periosteum was stripped off' the adjacent bone and laid into the gap that was left after the removal of the fractured ends and the intervening fibroid tissue, care being taken not to sever the periosteal connection between the transplanted shell and the body of the bone. Operations for ununited fracture very rarely succeed in children when the disunion is o'wing to other than local causes, ihey may succeed in old people : I have imited a lemur that had been disunited for recently performed transplantation of bone in a case where a portion of the395 TREATMENT OF FALSE JOINT. nearly twelve months in a man between sixty and seventy by DiefFenbach’s method. The more thickly the bone is covered by soft parts, the more likely will an operation be to snccccd. Hence the hmnerns and femur are more lavourable for operation than the tibia. On reviewing the various methods that have been recommended for the re-establishment of union between the separated fragments, it would appear that the excitation of proper inflammatory action by the introduction of the seton, or by driving in ivory pegs, promises the most satisfactory result. It is ])y no means necessary, or even advisable, to remove the fibrous band that iuten-enes between the fragments in cases of false joint; for, if the proper amount of inflannnatoiy action be set up, this either undergoes osseous trans- formation, or a sufficient quantity of callus is throuui out around it to con- solidate the fracture. It is very important that the pegs should be removed from the bone, for, if they be allowed to remain after the bone has united, tedious supjruration and necrosis of the bone may result. If union should fail to be accomphshed, and the false joint were situated in the femiu' or the bones of the leg, the limb might be so useless and cumbersome to the patient, that amputation might be required as a last resource. FFRACTURES. 39^ CHAPTER XXI. —♦— SPECIAL FPtACTURES. In coiisicleriug the natui-e and treatment of fractiu’es of particular hones, we shah at present coniine onr remarks to Fractiu-es of the Bones of the Face, Trunk, and Extremities. Injiules of the Bones of the Head and Spine derive their principal interest and importance from their compheation wth lesion of the internal and contained organs; hence the consideration of these mil be defeiTed to special Chapters. FBACTTJEES OF THE BONES OF THE FACE. Nasal Bones.—These, being thin as weU as exposed, are not nufrequently broken. When fractiu-ed, they may remain undisplaced, but they are more commonly depressed; the ridge of the nose being beaten in. The swelling and ecchymosis. that usually attend their fr’actime often render detection difficidt, and must be reduced before any treatment can be ado^Dted for the removal of the defoimity. The depressed bone should be raised with the broad end of a director, or by the introduction into the nostril of a pair of polypus-forceps, which, expanding on being opened, push the bone into proper position. A flaccid vidcanised India-rubber dilator, of proper size and shape, introduced empty, and then expanded Avith water, will be found to answer admirably in restoring the shape, and removing the disfigiu’ement of a “ broken nose,” even though some weeks have elapsed since the injmy. If the septum alone be broken, the same treatment must be adopted ; the nose being supported and moulded into shape. As a rule, after it has been replaced, the position is maintained: but in some cases, where there is a tendency to sinking of the soft parts of the nose, the introduction of a plug of oiled hut round a qniU, left open for breathing, mU be required to replace and retain the organ in proper shape and prominence. The hemorrhage, AA'hich is usually rather abundant in the first instance, may be stopped by the apphea- tion of ice ; but occasionally the nostrils require plugging, in order to prevent it fr-om continuing to a dangerous extent. If the lachrymal hone be broken together with the nasal, the ductus ad nasmn may be obstructed, and the com-se of the tears diverted. In an injiuy of this kind, I have seen exten- sive emphysema of the eyelids and forehead occiu” on the patient attempting to blow his nose. In some cases, the injury indicted on the nasal bones extends through the ethmoid to the base ot the brain, and may thus occa- sion death. This I have seen happen from a severe blow on the face with a piece of wood.

More commonly the alveolar processes arc detaclied, and the teeth loosened. The treatment then consists in binding the teeth together with gold wire.i^In fractures of the zijgoma, the fi-ag-ments may be di'iTcn into the temporal muscle, and produce so much difficulty in mastication as to require removal. In some rare cases, all the bones of the face appear to have been smashed, and separated from the skull by the infliction of great violence. Thus, South relates the case of a man who was struck on the face with a handle of a crane, and in whom all the bones were separated and loosened, “ feeling like beans in a bag.” Vidal records the case of a man, who, by a fall from a great height, separated all his facial bones. A patient was admitted into University College Hospital under my care, who had fallen thirty feet over the balusters of a spiral staircase. He had in some way struck his face, either on reaching the gTOund or in the fall. He hved only about two hours after admission. On making a g>ost mortem examination, the foIlo^A^ng injuries were found. The lower jaAV was fractmed through the ramus on the left side, and through the body between the molar teeth on the right side. In the upper jaw a trans- A'erse fracture ran completely across fr’om one side of the face to the other, at about the level of the inferior border of the anterior nares. It passed through both superior maxiUaiy bones, the vertical part of the palate bones, both pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone on both sides, and the vomer; so that the whole of the alveolar portions of the superior maxilla and the palate formed one piece. This was displaced backwards into the pharynx. The zygoma Avas fr-actured on both sides ; and a vertical fractm-e ran on each side from the margin of the orbit through the walls of the antrum; so that on each side there was one huge fragment composed of part of the zygoma, the malar bone, and the part of the superior maxillary bone Avith which it is articulated. The nasal bones, the nasal processes of the superior maxillary bones, the os unguis on each side, and the ethmoid, were smashed into numerous small fragments. There was no fracture visible from the interior of the skull. There were no other injuries of importance foimd. In Gun-Shot Injuries of the Face,, there is usually great splintering of the bone. As, however, the vitality of the part is great, necrosis is not so hkely to ensue here as elsewhere; and the partially detached and loosened fragments may accordingly be put baek into position, and wiU usually recoA’er themsefres. rhere are, however, two principal dangers in these cases ; viz., hasmon’hage, either primary or secondary, and abundant fetid muco-j)uriform discharge. The primary hmmoiThage usually ceases spontaneously, or on the application of cold. If secondary, it may be airested by cold, by plugging, and by pressm-e ; or, if continuous, and from deep soiu’ces, it may possibly require ligature of the carotid. The fetid secretion from these wounds is not only a somce of great discomfort to the patient, but of positive danger, as, by its miasmatic effluvia, or by finding its AA'ay into the stomach, it may occasion typhoid symptoms, this risk is best obviated by scrupulous attention to cleanliness, by repeated of'pob^T warm Avater, chlorinated lotions, or a solution of permanganate Loatou Jaav.—This bone is fr-cquently broken, OAviug to its prominent situa- tion ; though Its arched shape enables it to resist all but extreme degrees of598 SPEC IA L ERA CTUR ES. violence Fmeturcs of this bone ave often compound, sometimes in conse- quence of evtcinal noimd, but more frequently from the laceration of the gum unl-oque„t.y,W Fracture of the loivcr jaw may occur in various situations. I have seen it most ft-cqnently m the body of the bone near the symphysis extendi,,., between the latei-al incisor and the canine teeth. The symphysis’itself is not SO commonly fractured, tlie bone being thick in this situation. The anirle is more frequently broken. The coronoid process can only suffer fr-actm-e fr-om the most severe and direct external injm-y, as from a bullet-woimd.' The neck of the condyle is occasionally broken across. Fractures near the symphysis are usuaUy vertical. Those near the ano-le are commonly obhque fr-om before backwards, so that a long spiculum of the outer table is coimected with the upper fragment. These fractures are sometimes double, either symmetricaUy so, or more frequently one on the side near the symphysis, and the other near the angle. The Signs of fr-actine of the lower jaw are very obvious. The *gTeat mobihty of the fragments, the crepitus, the irregulcarity of the line of teeth and of the arch of the jaw, laceration of and bleeding fr-om the gums, and diibbling of sah\a, indicate unequivocally the natiue of the injury. The displacement and mobility of the fracture are greater, the nearer it is to the symphysis. If the bone happen to be broken on both sides of this line, the middle fr-agment is much dragged out of place by the depressor muscles attached to it; indeed, in all double fr-actiues the displacement is very great. In fractiu’e about the angle and lower part of the ramus, the deformity is not so great, owing to the muscles that coat and protect each side of the bone in this situation preventing the fragments from being displaced. When the neck of the condyle is broken through, that process, coming under the influence of the external pterygoid muscle, is often a great deal disiDlaced. When the fractiue is near the symphysis, the dental canal escapes ; but Avhen it is fruther back in the body of the bone, and especially near the angle, the canal must necessarily be impheated. It is remarkable, however, that the inferior dental nerve usuaUy escapes injury or division in many cases altogether, in others for several days, until, perhaps, OAving to great displace- ment or to some effort of reduction, it may be tom across. When this happens, the soft parts of the lower hjA, supjDhed by the mental branch of the inferior dental, are necessarily for a time deprived of sensation, but they soon recover. I have never knoAvn any permanent mischief fr-om this cause, or fr-om the htemorrhage following laceration of the hiferior dental artery. The Treatment is simple enough in principle, though often not A'ery easy of accomphshment. It consists in maintaining the pai-ts in apposition by suitable apparatus for four or five Aveeks, diuing Avhich time mastication must be inter- dicted, the patient living on sops, soups, and fluid nourishment of all kinds, and talking being prohibited. The appai-atus that commonly sufiices consists of a gutta-percha sphnt (Fig. 149), moulded to the pai-t (Fig. 150), properly padded, and fixed on A\dth a foiu-tailed bandage ; the two fore-ends ot whicli arc tied behind the neck, Avhilst the other tAvo are knotted over the top of the head (Fig. 151). When the ramus is broken, the side of the gutta-percha ciq>399 FRACTURE OF THE LOWER JAW. spliut should be made proportionately long. The teeth in these cases require special attention. Any that are loosened must he left in, as they will soon contract adhesions, and fix themselves firmly ; and, if necessary, they may he tied to the sonnd teeth with silver wire, or dentist’s silk. But, although metalhc wire is occasionally needed for the pm’pose of more acciu-ately fixing the Iragments, care must be taken that any tooth that may have been forced out of its alveolus and dropped between the fi’agments be removed from this situa- tion ; in one case where a tooth Avas overlooked in this position, no miion of the fractm-e took place till it had been removed. When depression, especially near the symphysis, is considerable, a clamp apparatus which ihxes the chin Fig. 103, tlie key. and line of teeth, invented by Lonsdale, ansv-ers the piu'pose of steadying the fragments extremely well. hen the fracture is double, one fissure occurring near the symphysis, the other near the angle, there is often A'ery considerable difficulty in bringing the fragments into anything like good position, ivithout the aid of some special apparatus. In such cases a metal plate should be acciu’ately moulded and fitted to the teeth, and attached to Lonsdale’s clamp or to a stem, and fixed to a horse-shoe shaped gutta-percha splint placed under the jaiv, so as to keep the whole steady and solid. Union generally takes place readily and very perfectly in fractures of the jaw, though it is somewhat slow at first, and the fragments continue mobile for some weeks. But the vascular supply of the bone is abundant, and reparative action correspondingly jyv-'i rcct. In all compound fractmes of the lower jaAv, H. 0. Thomas strongly advocatesSPEC I A L FRA C THREE. 400 drilling’ the bone on each side of the fractnre, and fixing the fragments by means ot sifr er n ire. He finds that the ordinary cross-twist does not hold ; ho therefore coils the wire at each side (Fig. 152, 154). In order to facilitate this opera- tion, he has devised a set of in- struments, comprising a tubular needle to retimn the wire, and a key for coiling it (Fig. 153). In Fractures of the Body of the Lower Jaw hy Gun-shot Injury, there is great comminution and splin- tering of the bone, followed by copious and fetid discharge, which, being in part swallowed, may redirce the patient to a state of extreme debility, or induce symptoms of a typhoid character, which may prove fatal. In these cases, Dupuytren recommends the lower lip to be cut through, the splinters taken away, and, if necessary, a portion of the bone resected, so as to convert the wound into one similar to what results after the partial removal of the lower jaw for disease of the bone. Fracture of the Hyoid Bone is of very rare occurrence ; and, though usually the result of direct violence, as a forcible gxasp, has been seen by Ollivier D’Angers to occur from muscular action. The signs are always veiy obvious. The fragments form a sharp salient angle : there is much pain and irritation, increased by speaking and deglutition. There is usually salivation ; and considerable difficulty in breathing may be present. Reduction is accom- plished by pressing the fragments into apposition, either externally or by passing the finger into the mouth. Should one piece of the bone be driven much in, it might possibly require to be chraum forwards with a tenaculum. The head should then be fixed with a stiff pasteboard collar to prevent displacement. fractures of the bones of the chest. Fracture of the Ribs and Costal Cartilages. These injiuies may occur in two ways : 1st, fr’om direct violence, the part that is struck being driven in towards the thoracic cavity, and thus broken; 2nd, thefractme occurs fr’om indirect violence, the fore part of the chest being forcibly compressed, so that the rib is bent outwards, and snaps. When the injiny is the result of direct violence, and the broken fr-agments are forced in, the plcma, lung, liver, or diaphi’agm, may be wounded, thus giving rise to the most serious and fatal’cousequences, such as haemon’hage, emphysema, and inflammation of the parts injured When it is occasioned by indirect violence, as the fr-actiue takes place in a direction outwards, the thoracic organs may be contused and thus injured, but they are not liable to be punetiued by the fr-agments. In some rare cases, the ribs have been known to bo broken by the violent contraction of the abdominal muscles during parturient efforts.

Fractures of tlic ribs may be single; muUqjh wlien SGTcral, or even the vholc of the ribs on one side, or several on both sides, are fractured ; simile, as ^ ordinary violence ; and compound, as in gunshot injuries; or when the DioKen ends are driven into the lung. , a -if iiiy one of the ribs may be broken, and frequently several are ti-actuieci ac the same time. The middle ribs, from the fourth to the eighth, are those that most frequently give way, being most exposed, and at the same time hxea. The first and second ribs arc seldom broken, being protected by the clavicle and shoulder. ’When they are fractured it is usually the result of gunshot or, if from some of the ordinary accidents of civd life, the clavicle mil be broken as well. But this is not an invariable complication. I have seen fr-actines ot the first two ribs from a fall, without any injury to neighbouring bones. ^ This fr-acture is always very dangerous, on accomit of the liability to injiny ot important subjacent structincs. The lower ribs, being less fii-mly fixed than the others, commoidy escape, unless very great and dfrect violence be inflicted upon them. Any part of a rib may be broken by direct violence ; but when the fractine is the result of compression of the chest, it is usually the point of greatest convexity or the neighbourhood of the angle of the rib that gives way. These indirect fi-actines most commonly occin in elderly people, in whom the elasticity of the thoracic pailetes has lessened as the result of age. Symptoms.—The chief symptom is a sharp pricking and catching pain at the seat of injury, increased by breathing deeply, or by coughing. In order to avoid this, the inspirations are shallow, and the breathing is principally diaphi-agmatic and abdominal. On laying the hand over the seat of injury, and desiring the patient to cough, crepitus may often be felt; and in most cases this is audible on applying the ear to the chest. Occasionally the outline of the rib ivill be found to be irregular ; and in some instances, where several ribs are broken, the whole side of the chest is flattened and depressed. Besides these local symptoms, special complications resulting from the lacera- tion of the plem’a and lung, such as hjemoptysis, pneumothorax, or emphy- sema, may occur. These complications are much less frequent than might a p-iori be supposed, [ovdng to the fractming force being usually indirect, causing the rib to bend outwards, and thus to break away from, instead of into, the chest. The danger of fractmed ribs depends on the thoracic compheations, and these will chiefly be occasioned by one of two conditions : either by the forcible driring in of the fractined end of one rib, so that the pleura and lung become woimded by the sharp and ragged fragment; or else by a large number rof ribs being broken by a severe squeeze of the chest, and the thoracic organs injined by the general compression. It is surprising, however, what an extent of injury of this kind may take place without serious consequences. I have had under my care a young man, Avho, in consequence of a crush of the chest, in a railway accident, had the upper seven ribs broken on the right side, and the lower five on the left, the chest, especially on the right side, being gveatly flattened ; he recovered without a bad symptom. In gunshot injuries of the chest, with splintering of the ribs, there is always wound of the contained organs, which becomes the main source of danger to the patient and of attention on the part of the Surgeon.

The chest-wall, even Avhen extensively flattened, gradually expands under the influence of the respiratory mo’cements. It, however, a portion of the rib continue depressed, it had most certainly better be left so : the suggestions that have been made for elevating these fractures by m6ans of shaiq) hooks and screw-probes, being more likely than the continuance of the depression to occasion serious mischief to the contents of the thorax. In order to prevent undue motion of the broken bone and consequent irritation prodirccd by its punctming the plema, or lung, the movements of the injined part of the chest may be restrained by the appli- cation of a broad flannel roller, or of a laced napkin roimd it. Instead of, or in addition to these means, it A^^ll be foimd most useful to apply a roll of adhesive plaster round the chest. The plaster must be about a foot in Avidth, and should be sufficiently long to make one and a half tiuns round the body. It should be applied very tightly, and may be left on for ten days or a fortnight, when it may require reapplication. It supports the chest more fiinily and evenly than an ordinary bandage, affording the patient great comfort. There is alAvays a considerable amount of callus throAAm out in the repair of fractimed ribs, on account of the constant moA'ement that necessarily takes place betAveeu the broken ends in respiration. In some cases, hoAAuver, more particularly in those in AA'hich the fragments are driA'en iiiAAnrds, it mil be found that the con- striction of the chest, by bandage or plaster, becomes unbearable to the patient, producing great pain and intense dyspneea. In these circumstances all con- striction must be removed, and the patient be alloAAnd to breathe easily, but he must be confined to bed. If the loAver ribs be broken, the diaphi’ag’m may become irritated by the projection inwards of the fractured bone ; and if the plaster and bandage be applied too tightly, spasmodic action of that muscle may ensue, occasioning distressing hiccup and dyspnoea. In gimshot injuries of the chest AAuth splintering of the ribs, all broken spicula of bone must be carefully picked out, and the wound lightly coA'ered AAlth Avater-dressing. In such cases, the grave injiu’ies usually sustained by the intrathoracic organs aaHI absoih the Sm’geon’s attention ; and for their treat- ment I must refer to Chapter XXVIII. The preA'ention of inflammatory action must be attempted, by the employ- ment of bleeding if necessary ; but certainly by the adoption of a spare diet and complete rest. Any complications that may occm, such as emphysema, or inflammation of the lungs or plema, must be treated in accordance AAoth the principles that will be laid doAim in speaking of Injuries of the Chest generally. It occasionally happens that fractmn of one or more of the Costal Cartilages, especially the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth, is produced by direct violence. They may be separated from their junction Avith the rib, or broken across tbe middle. The existence of fracture may be determined by the pain on pressure, mobility, and iiTegularity at the seat of injiuy. The same treatment is lequiiet for this fr-acture as for a broken rib ; the broken cartilage most commonly uniting by a bony callus Avhich smrouuds the Iractmcd ends.FRACTURE OF THE CLAVICLE. 403 Fracture of the Sternum.—The sternum is not often broken. Its fi’ac- tm-c nsnally occurs from very severe and direct violence ; and when this is applied on the forepart of the chest, the ribs or costal cartilages are more liable to suffer. The elastic support furnished to the sternum by these structures, explains in a great measime the rarity of its fr-acture. It may also be produced by violent bending forward of the body after the spine has been broken. It has been known to be broken, though very rarely, by violent straining muscidar efforts during parturition. Its fractures are always transverse, usually single, but sometimes multiple. I have seen it broken into three nearly equal firag- ments by a fall fr'om a scaffold. The displacement of one of the firagments is sometimes considerable ; bnt even if it be not, the very superficial situation of the bone will always enable the Surgeon to judge of the exact natime of the injury it has sustained, the signs of Avhich resemble those of a fractimed rib. The Treatment must be conducted on the same principles as in a broken rib, and presents nothing deserving of special attention. Indeed, when fractiu’e of the stermun ocem-s fr-om external violence, it is commonly associated Avith fr-actine of the ribs, near the angles ; and then the chest-bandage or plaster ansAvers equally for both injiu'ies. Should the sternum be broken during par- turition, the patient should be made to sit up in bed, with the shoulders supported and leaning forwards slightly, so as to take off the tension of the abdominal muscles. If a portion of broken sternum be depressed, it should be left undistiu’bed. It uill gix'e rise to no serious inconvenience, while any attempt to raise it by surgical interference may be attended with the gTeatest danger. FRACTURES OF THE UPFER EXTREMITY. The Clavicle is more frequently broken than any other bone in the body. For this there are three reasons. First, it is exposed to the influence of direct violence ; secondly, it receii'es all shocks transmitted through the shoulder in a horizontal direction to the trmik; and thirdly, being the only direct osseous sup- port of the up]ier extremity, it receives, by transmission through the scapida, every shock that is communicated to the hand when the arm is extended. Hotivith- standing its exposed jiosition, it is comparatively seldom broken by direct iujiny. The great majority of the fractures occur fi’oin indirect violence, as falls on the shoulder and the hand. This bone would be moi’e frequently broken than it is, ivere it not that it resembles two segments of a circle looking in opposite directions, so as to fomi an S shape, which admirably enables it to Avithstand indirect violence (Fig. 156). 1 he clavicle is occasionally fractured by muscular action—more particularly fr’om the SAAing of the arm, as in a back-handed blow. When the accident occurs from this cause, it is usually about the middle of the bone, and on the right side. Compound fracture of the clavicle can only occur from buUet-AVOunds, or some similar seA^cre and direct injmy inflicted upon the bone. Fractures fr-om direct violence are usually transverse, and often comminuted, from mdireet violence they are oblique. The latter are attended by mucli more deformity than the former. Fractm-cs of this bone in infants and young children are usually transverse; D D 2404 SPECIAL FRACTURES. sometimes the bone is merely bent, or is fractured on one side only. The injury is usually occasioned by Mling out of bed. Such accidents are fre- quently overlooked by careless nurses ; but, the child crying whenever the arm is moved, attention is directed to the part, and the Surgeon then finds some deformity, with a node-like swelling above the middle of the bone. Both cla\dcles are occasionally, though rarely, fr-actured. In one such case, which was under my care at University College Hospital, the patient, a young man of 20, had sustained this injury, and had twelve ribs broken as well, in a railway accident. Notwithstanding this serious complication, he made an excellent recovery. Complications.—In simple oblique fr’actime of the clavicle, there is rarely any complication of importance. But when the fractoe is the result of direct violence, the same force that breaks the bone may seriously injure subjacent parts of importance. The subclavian vein may be compressed or wounded, or the brachial plexus of nerves may be compressed or tom. The first rib may be broken by the crushing violence, and the plem-a woimded. The clavicle may be fr-actured at any point between the ligaments at its acromial and sternal ends. 1. Most fr-equently the Great Convexity is broken ; the bone bending here when pressed upon fr-om its extremity, the curve becoming increased, and at last giving way. This fractiu-e may arise from direct violence, but usually is the result of falls on the hand or shoulder. 2. It may be fr-actm-ed nearer the acromion, between the two Coraco-cla-vi- cnlar Ligaments. 3. Its Tip may be broken off externally to the outei-most point of insertion of the trapezoid ligament, between it and the acromion. These latter two fr-actures can scarcely occiu* from indirect, but are almost always the result of direct violence. 4. The clavicle may be broken internally, that is, to the Sternal Side of the Rhomboid Ligament, usuaUy about three quarters of an inch from its sternal articulation. This injiu-y is of very rai-e occm-reuce. R. W. Smith, although admitting its possibility, states that there is no actual proof fr-om dissection of its having occiu-red. The Signs wiU depend upon the seat of fractiu-e. A¥hen the bone is broken letiveen ilie conoid and tra'pezoid ligaments, there is little, if any, displacernent, but pain on pressiu-e, some crepitus on moving the shoulder, and shght irre- gularity in running the finger along the bone, are usually present. When the fractm-e is external to the trapezoid ligaments, there is a remarkably obhque displacement of the scapular fr-agment, the articular surface of w^hich is tiu’ued forwards and inwards, with a shght inclination downwards, nearly at right angles to the rest of the bone, apparently by the dragging of the weight of the shoulder, the point of which, with the scapula, is rounded for- wards (Fig. 157). When the fr-actiu-c occiu-s aloitt the middle of the lone, or at any part on the sternal side of the scapular ligaments, there is a remai-kablc deo'ree of deformity, owing to a triple displacement of the inner end of the outer fr-agment inwards, downwards, backwards, while the outer end is rotated forwards. is isj Fig. 156.—Sound Clavicle. Fig. 157.—Fi-acture of Clavicle, outside of Trapezoid Liga- ment.405 FE AC TUBE OF THE CLAVICLE. is due to two causes, one of which is mechanical and the other muscular. The displacement downwards is owing to the weight of the arm and the action of the deltoid muscle dragging the fragment down. The displacement inwm-ds, with rotation of the shoulder forwards and pointing of the sternal end of the outer fr-agment backwards, is due to the action of the pectoralis minor, and the subcla^ius, and the other muscles that pass fr-om the fr'ont and sides of the trmik to the hmnerus and scapula, draA\dng the scapula and the Avhole of the upper extremity forwards and inwards towards the mesial line, when the support of the clavicle is removed. The outer extremity of the iimer fr-agment appoara to be elevated, the skin being dravm tensely over it; but this is rather owing to the depression of the outer portion of the bone ; it is usually kept fixed by the antagonism between the sterno-cleido-mastoid and great pectoral muscles. It may, however, in some cases be raised. This is when the clavicular portion of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle is unusually strong, and when the fr-actm-e has taken place just outside its insertion into the clavicle; or it may be raised and pushed forwards, by the inner end of the outer fragment getting below or behind it. On looking at a patient with fractiu-e of the cla-vdcle in this situation, the natm-e of the injiu-y is at once evident. The flattening of the shoulder, and the approximation of its point towards the sternum ; the great prominence foi-med by the outer end of the inner fragment, over which the skin is tightly stretched ; the sudden depres- sion under this, and the crepitus, Ayhich can be easily induced by elevating and rotating the shoulder at the same time that the elbow is pressed to the side, indicate in the most unequivocal mamier the nature of the injury. The atti- tude of the patient is remarkable : he sits, leaning his head down to the affected side, so as to relax the muscles, and supports his elbow and forearm in the sound hand, in order to take off the weight of the limb. When the fractm-e occiu’s near to the sternal end of the bone, it is usually, if not always, transverse. If it occur internally to the rhomboid hgament, the outer fr-agment is displaced forward, but remains in the same horizontal level as the sternal fr-agment. If the triple displacement of the outer fr-ag- ment, characteristic of fr-actiu-ed clavicle, vizi, in a direction downwards, forwards, and imA'ards, have ocem-red, then E,. W. Smith believes that, how- ever near the joint the fractiu-e may appear to be, it must in reahty have occiUTed externally to the costo-clavicular ligament, which is too strong to admit of this displacement, or to be ruptured, and so to aUoAV it to be occasioned. Comminnted Tracture of the Clavicle is the result of seA'ere and direct violence. It is a dangerous accident, as the subclaAuan vein and adjacent plexus of nerves, or the upper part of the plem-a, may be seriously injiu-ed. In a case that Avas under my care, the subclavian A'ein was apparently Avomided, gi-eat extravasation of blood taking place about the shoulder and neck, and the circulation through the veins of the arm being so much interfered AAuth as to threaten gangrene. The case, however, did per- fectly AA-ell under the continuous application of evaporating lotions to the shoulder, and attention to the position of the arm. But in another case, gangrene^ ot the arm took place, leading to amputation at the shoulder- jomt. The patient died of pyaemia, and a fragment about one inch long4o6 SPECIAL FRA CTURES. separated from the posterior part of the clavicle was found lying upon, and compressing, the subclavian vein. Dr. John Ogle relates a case of comminuted fracture of the clavicle from direct violence, in which the right internal jugular vein was lacerated by one of the fr’agmcnts, there being great extravasation of blood. Treatment of Simple Fracture of the Clavicle.—There are few frac- tures for the cure of which so great a variety of ingenious and complicated contrivances has been devised, as those of the clavicle, and there arc few in which so much ingenuity has been displayed in vahx; for, however perfect the apparatus may appear to be, it seldom answers the pm-pose intended, viz., to cure the fractine mthout deformity. I believe that more may be done with a little skill and patience by simple means, than by the most elaborate mechanical contrivances. When the fr’actine occins at the tip of the acromial end of the clavicle, there is little if any linear disj)lacement of the broken bone ; and a figm-e-of-8 bandage round the shoulders, and keeping the arm in a sling, xvill prevent the tendency to rotation of the shoulder forwards. When the bone is broken undeineath the scapulo-clavicular h'gaments, there is but little displacement, and the same treatment will suffice. But when the fractme is situated towards the middle of the bone, or indeed at any point to the inside of these ligaments, then the management is more chfficidt; and there are three principal indications to be attended to in order to con’ect the triple displacement of the scapular fragment. 1. By making a fulcrum of a thick wedge-shaped cushion with its broad end upwards in the axiUa, and then bringing the elbow closely to the side, the humerus is made to act as a lever and chaw the shoulder and the scapular fragment outwards, thus correcting the displacement inwards. 2. By pressing the elbow Avell backwards, behind the lateral median line of the body, the tendency to rotation forwards of the shoulder is removed. 3. By elevating the shoulder, and taking off the weight of the arm by means of a short shng that passes well imder the elbow, the displacement doAvnwards is remedied. By these simple means the triple displacement of the outer fragment is cor- rected. But the great difficulty consists in keeping the fractme in a good position; and when it is obhque, this becomes almost impossible, so that a cure without nodular or angular deformity is very seldom obtained. I used formerly to recommend that the fingers should be bandaged sepa- rately, the pahn wadded, and the bandage earned up as high as the axillary pad. More extended experience leads me to doubt the expediency of aU these directions, and I now content myself with simply bandaging the hand and fore- arm lightly and leaving the tips of the fingers free, so that the conditions of the circulation through the limb can be watched. Care must be taken not to use the lever-like movement of the ai-m against the fulcrum of the axillary pad too forcibly lest the axillary vein or plexus of nerves be compressed. Before applying the roller, the elbow must always be flexed : otherwise undue and dangerous constriction of the arm may occur. The pad should be firm, made of bed-tick stuffed with brarr, six irrehes long, five broad, arrd three thick at its upper part; the sling must support the elbow, and the band shorrld be well raised across the chest. Irr the accompanyirrg figure, the sling docs irotFRACTURES OF THE SCAPULA. 407 Fig. 158.—Aijparatus for Frac- tured Clavicle. extend so ftu- towards the elbow as it ought to. It is represented in this way, in order not to conceal the other parts of the apparatus (Fig. 158). The elbow must be kept to the side by a few tiu-ns of a roller, or by means of a padded belt. In children, in whom these fractures often occur, there is frequently a difficulty in keeping the bandages properly applied ; in these circumstances the starched apparatus will be found very useful, ■care being taken to re-apply it as often as it becomes loose, lest deformity result. Fractured clavicles occurring in females, to whom any irregularity of union in this situation would be very annoying, are best treated by keeping the patient lying flat on her back in bed for the first two or three weeks. By this plan, which is as old as the days of Hippo- crates, I have seen better results produced than by any other. "When both clavicles are broken, the patient should be kept in bed, and the shoulder fixed and drawn backwards by means of a figure-of-8 bandage. In the case already alluded to (p. 404), this could not be borne, owing to the simultaneous fractm’e of the ribs; but the patient nevertheless made a good recovery with little deformity. In Comminuted Fracture of the Clavicle, it must always be remembered that the subclavian vein may be compressed or contused. It is, therefore, of importance to avoid all means that may interfere with the return of venous blood from the arm. Hence the bandaging of the fingers, hand, and fore-arm should be omitted, and the axillary pad laid aside. The limb should be di-awn back, supported in a shng, and the patient kept recumbent until miion has been attained. i In comminuted simple fr-acture of the clavicle with vertical depression of the central portion, Aunandale has removed the displaced piece of bone. Feactuees of the Scapula.—l. Fracture of the Sody of the Scapula is not very commonly met with ; and when it occurs, being always the result of considerable direct violence, it is usually associated with serious injury to the subjacent ribs and trunk. The thick layer of muscles OA'erlying this bone not only protects it, but limits displacement, and renders the detec- tion of its fracture difficult. The fracture usually takes place across the bone, immediately below the spine ; but occasionally it may be split longitudinally or starred. Ihe consists in placing the arm in a sling, the application of a ody-bandage, and sujjport of the part with a pad. But all Surgeons who have seen this accident are agreed as to the extreme difficulty of obtaining union Without considerable deformity ; which, however, is of less moment here than m most other situations. Fractures lu the Vicinity of the Shoulder-Joint are of common occurence, and may happen either in the bony points of the scapula that hang this articulation, or else in the upper end of the humerus. HotSPECIAL FRACTURES. 4o8 tuificquenfcly theie is double fracture in the neighbourhood of this articulation ;• thus the acromion may be broken, as well as the neck of the humerus. These complications, as well as, in many cases, the amount of contusion, and the rapid swelling that takes place, necessarily render the diagnosis somewhat difficult. 2. The Acromion, forming as it does the very tip of the shoulder, is more frequently broken than any other part of the scapula. But, in spite of its exposed situation, fracture of this process through its base is not very common at least I have seen but few cases of it, and there is good reason to helieve that many of the cases of supposed fractm’e in this situation are in reality cases of delayed ossification of the fine of junction between the base and the epiphysis. Notwithstanding this source of fallacy, there can be no doubt, as is proved by numerous prepai’ations, that this fracture does occur. The Signs of this fracture are obvious. When the acromion is broken ofl* near its root, the arm hangs as a dead weight by the side, and the patient, feeling as if his arm were dropping off, supports it with the other hand. There- is flattening of the shoulder, which is most marked when the patient is looked at from behind ; and the head of the humerus can be felt somewhat lower in the axilla than natural. On running the finger along the spine of the scapula, a sudden inequality in the line of the bone can be detected ; and, on raising- the elbow and rotating the arm, crepitus can be felt, the rounded outline of the- shoulder being restored. When the tip only of the acromion is broken off, the nature of the injury- may be suspected if the patient be unable to raise his arm to a level vith his head, so as to touch the crown, owing to some of the fibres of the deltoid having- lost their points of attachment; and it may be determined by the existence in a minor degi’ee of some of the preceding signs, which prevent the accident fr-om being confounded with paralysis of the deltoid from contusion ; and especially by the tip being felt to be detached. But as has already been stated, this may be a congenital defect, to which perhaps attention has only been directed when the shoulder has been bruised or otherwise injured. The Treatment consists principally in raising the elbow, so as to take off the- weight of the limb, and to push up the acromion by the head of the humerus. If the extremity only be broken off in front of the acromio-clavicular articula- tion, a pad may be placed between the elbow and the side, in order to direct the arm somewhat upAvards and inwards, and the hmb must be fixed in this- position by a bandage and sling. Should the fracture have taken place at or behind the line of the claAdcular articulation, the treatment must be the same as that for fractured claAficle. When the base of this process is broken across, there is not much separation between the fragments, and union usually takes place by bone. When the apex is detached, fibroid or ligamentous union generally occius, the fr-agments being widely separated. 3. The Coracoid Process is but seldom broken, there not being more than ten or twelve unequivocal cases of this accident recorded. It cannot happen, except by very direct A-iolence. There is in the Museum of Univei’sity College a preparation showing a fracture of the base of this process, implicating and extending through the glenoid cavity, and complicated with fracture across409- FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. the base of the acromion. The attachment of such powerful muscles as the ]K;ctoralis minor, biceps, and coraco-brachialis, displaces the fragment con- siderably, and would do so still more, were it not that it is kept in position by the ligaments to which it gives insertion, and whose fibres are expanded over it. The only Treatment that can be adopted is to put the arm in a sling and fix it to the side. 4. Fracture of tlie JSTeck of the Scapula immediately behind the glenoid cavity is a rare injury. Its existence has been doubted: A. Cooper and South have stated that cases so described are, in reality, instances of fracture of the upper end of the humerus. There is, according to South, no preparation in any museum in London illustrating fr-acture of the neck of the scapula. A case, however, recorded by Spence in the EdMurg?!, Medical Journal for 1863, puts tile occasioual occmTence of the injury beyond doubt. A man was brought into the Edinburgh Infirmary, who had fallen on his shoidder while intoxicated. There was falling of the limb towards the axiUa, with projection of the acromion and flattening of the deltoid; and crepitus was felt. The contour of the shoulder was restored by drawing the arm from the side and raising the hmb. The man died some days afterwards from meningitis, the result of an injury to the forehead which he had received during the fall. On examining the shoulder, “the fracture was found to pass obhquely from below, upwards and forwards, commencing about half-an-inch behind the origm of the long head of the triceps, and separating the neck and four-fifths of the lower part of the glenoid cavity from the scapula. The long head of the biceps and the whole of the glenoid hgament had also been torn from the upper fragment of the glenoid cavity, and carried along with the displaced portion.” The Trecdmeni of such an injury, if it were diagnosed, would consist in keeping the whole aim well raised and fixed to the chest, with a pad in the axilla. Fractuees op the Humerus.—In studying the fractures of the humenis, we must divide that bone into three parts,—the Upper Articular End, the Shaft, and the Lower Articular End. 1. Fractures of the Upper Articular Fud of the Humerus not unfre- quently occur, constituting an important class of injuries which have been care- fully studied by Sir A. Cooper, and more recently by E. W. Smith, whose work on F'lactures deserves the attentive perusal of eveiy practitioner. Five kinds of fracture of the humerus are met with in the immediate vicinity of the shoulder-joint. Two of these are Intracapsular, viz., Simple Fracture ^ the Anatomical Neck, and Impacted Fracture of this portion of the bone. Ihe remaining three are Extracapsular, viz.. Fractures of the Singical Neck Simple and Impacted; and Separation of the Great Tubercle. Intracapsular Fracture of the Neck of the Humerus.—T\Tieii the acture occurs at the anatomical node, the head of the bone is detached from e tubercles, a little above or at the line of insertion of the capsule. This acture is occasioned by severe falls or blows on the shoulder. It cannot unera or fracture its shaft, hut it cannot break its upper articular410 SPECIAL Eli AG TUBES. end. This fracture is comparatively rare in children, but is frequent in adults. The signs of this injury are by no means very distinct, though much light has been thrown upon them by the labours of R. W. Smith. There is loss of motion in the shoulder, with some swelling and considerable pain, together with some deformity ; an irregularity, produced by the upper end of the lower fr’agment, can be felt towards the inner side of the joint; crepitus is easily produced ; and there is, on measurement from the acromion to the olecranon, shortening to the extent of about one-third of an inch. When this fr’actime is impacted, the upper fragment penetrates the lower one. In consequence of this, the axis of the hmnerus is directed somewhat inwards towards the coracoid process ; here also some irregular osseous swelling maybe detected. The head of the bone can be felt in the glenoid cavity, but is not in the axis of the limb, the elbow projecting shghtly fr-om the side, the#e being ■at the same time a hollow some little distance under the acromion. There is •consequently more deformity about the joint in the impacted than in the simple intracapsular fr’actm’e, with the same impairment of motion, but only slight crepitus on firmly grasping the shoulder and rotating the elbow. In fracture of the anatomical neck of the humerus, the portion of bone broken off is truly a foreign body'in the joint, and, being unconnected with any ligamentous structure, may perish, and thus give rise to destruction of the articulation. When this does not take place, it is probable that impaction of the fr’agment has occurred, and that thus its life is maiutained; or it may happen, as E. W. Smith supposes, that its vitahty is occasionally preserved in consequence of some partial union being kept up between it and the rest of the bone by untorn shreds of capsule. In either case, the principal reparative efforts are made by the lower fragment, which deposits callus abundantly. Treatment.—As there is often much swelling from contusion in these cases, evaporating lotions should be had recoimse to for a few days. A pad may then be j)laced in the axilla, and a leather or gutta-percha cap fitted to the shoulder and upper arm, the limb having previously been bandaged. The hand must be supported in a shng, and the elbow fixed to the side. In examining and reducing these intracapsular fractures, no violence should be employed, lest the impaction of the fragment be disturbed, or portions of untom capsule, on which the ultimate osseous repair of the injury is dependent, be broken through. Zjxtracapsular Fracture of the i^eck of the HEumerus.—In this injiuy, the bone is broken through the surgical neck, or that portion which is below the tubercles, but above the insertions of the pectoialis major, latissimus dorsi, teres major, and deltoid muscles. This accident is most frequent in adults, but it may occur in childi’en as well, the separation taking place through the lino of junction between the epiphysis and the shaft of the bone. In this fracture there is double displacement; the head of the bone and upper frag- ment are mtated outwards and abducted by the muscles inserted into the gicat tubercle, whilst the shaft i’s drawn upwards and imvards and forwards under the coracoid process, by the muscles going fr’om the trunk to the arm, and by the flexors of the limb. _ ., . . The Signs of this fracture are sufficiently obvious. The glenoid cauty isFRACTURE OF THE NECK OF THE JlUMEliUS. 4^1 rtlletl by the head of the bone, which can be felt in it. llelow this tl^cre is a depression ; crepitus is easily produced, and there are great mobility of the loirer fragment, and shortening of the limb to the e.xtent of from three-quarters to one inch ; but the most remarkalile sign is the prominence formed by the upper end of the shaft of the humerus, ^vhich projects under the integuments, and can readily be felt under the coracoid process, especially when the elbow' is pushed upwards and rotated. The axis of the bone is also dh-ected obliquely upwai'ds and inwards towards this point. In consequence of the irritation of the nerves of the axillary plexus by this fragment, Avhich is often very sharp and angular, a good deal of pain is complained of in the arm and fingers. This sign, however, is not met with in chilchcn, owing to the greater smoothness of the fractured surfaces. Impacted Extracapsular Fracture of the Neck of the Humerus has been especially treated of by R, W. Smith in his excellent work on Fractures. In this injury, the superior fr'agment being penetrated by the inferior one, the continuity of the bone and its firmness are in a great measure preseiwed; hence, the usual signs of fr’actiu’s, such as mobility, displacement, and crepitus, am not readily obtainable, and indeed the signs of this injury are chiefly negative. Thus, there are impairment of motion, slight deformity about the joint and upper part of .the arm, and some crepitus ; but the latter is only obtainable with difficulty, and by firmly grasping the head of the bone whilst the elbow is being rotated. Tlie Tr.eatment to be adopted in these cases should be carried out in accordance with the following principles and details : 1. To bandage the fingers, hand, and arm so as to prevent congestion and oedema of the limb ; 2. To place a pad in the axilla to act as a fulcrum ; 3. To bandage the elbow closely to the side so as to overcome the displace- ment imvards of the upper end of the shaft, Avhich ■wfill be thro’wn outwards by the axiUary pad ; 4. To cany the elbow (w^hilst it is being bandaged to the side) forwards across the chest, in advance of the lateral median fine, in order to comiteract the forward displacement of the upper end of the shaft, and thus to throAV it backwards tow'ards the head of the humerus ; 5. To apply a sling so as merely to support the hand and wrist, allow'ing the elbow to hang unsupported, and thus letting the weight of the arm counteract the displacement upwards (Fig. lo'j). By these means the triple disj)lacement of the upper end of the lower portion of the shaft imvards, forwards, and upw'ards will be counteracted. The w'hole is then to be steadied by means of a leather or gutta-percha cap, carefully moulded and fitted to the shoulder and arm. As the bruising and extravasation are often very considerable in these cas'es, it is as well to apply evaporating lotions in the first instance. In the management of some of these fractures, I have foimd a very coii- enient apparatus in a leather splint about two feet long by six inches broad.

In this Avay the limb is steadied, and the tendency to displacement inwards of the lower fragmeiit is corrected. In some cases, fracture of the neck of the himierus is followed by atrophy of the bone, though good union has taken place. Compound Fracture of the Surgical Neck of the Humerus is not of common occuiTence. I have had a case under my care in which the accident happened to a lad from a faU out of a window. The fracture Avas transA’erse, and the upper extremity of the loAA-er fragment Avas driven upAvards, and protruded through the deltoid, to the extent of an inch and a half. It was reduced A\ith difficulty : as great irritation was set up around the seat of injury, and as there was a tendency to recurrent protrusion of the.upper extremity of the loAver fragment, this was timned out by enlarging the wound, and about an inch and a half of it saAAm off. Union took place between the fragments, and recovery was effected Avith a very usefrd ann. Separation of the Great Tubercle of the Humerus occasionally occurs from falls and bloAvs upon the shoulder ; but more commonly as the result of the violent action of the three extenral rotator muscles Avhich are inserted irrto it. Irr this irrjru’y there is a dorrble displacerrrent; the tubercle is canied up- wards aird orrtwards arvay from the head of the bone, arrd under and external to the acromiorr process ; the head is drawrr upwards arrd inwards by the muscles passing from the trunk to the arm, as Avell as by the flexors of the arm, irr such a way that it hes uporr the imrer edge of the glenoid cavity rmder the coracoid process, arrd is indeed almost luxated. The conseqrrence of this double displacernerrt is a great increase in the breadth of the shoidder, which has nearly double its natiual size ; orr examination, a roimded tumoiu—the head of the bone—^moA'able orr rotating the arm, can be felt under the coracoid process, whilst another osseous mass—the great tubercle—^may be felt at the orrter arrd back part of the joint; between these a sulcus is perceptible, and crepitus may be felt by bringing the two portions of bone irrto apposition and rotating the arm. This accident, which is rare, has been most carefully described by Grrthrie and Smith, to whom Ave are indebted for oiu krrowledge of its pathology. The Treatment consists in an attempt to bring the detached tubercle into contact vdth the head, of the bone, arrd retain it there ; this may be done either by mechanical mearrs, or by relaxatiorr of the muscles. The treatment by mecharrical means consists in placing a pad in the axilla, and brirrging the elbow to the side so as to throw out the head of the bone, at the same time that, by means of a compress, the tubercle is pressed irrto proper posrtrorr, the arm beirrg srrpported in a shrrg.

The Treatment must depend upon the extent of the complications, it cue iiijuiy be chiefly eonfined to the head of the humerus, vnth little damage to the soft parts, and none to the main vessels or nerves, excision should be practised, any splinters in connection vith the scapular processes being removed at the same time. Should, however, the soft parts be extensively disorganised, and espeeially the gi'eat vessels and nerves torn, amputation is the sole resoiu’ce. 2. Fractures of the Shaft of the Humerus are usually somewhat obhque from above, downwards and outwards. They may occiu- from any kind of external idolenee, but are more frequently the result ot musculai action than those of any other long bone. The nature of the accident can be at once de- tected by the gi-eat mobility of the fragments, the ready production of crepitus, and the other ordinary signs of fr-actiu-e. The direction of the displacement depends upon the seat of the fr-actine. If the bone be broken above the insertion of the deltoid, and below those of the pectorahs major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles, the lower fragment will he to the outer side of the upper, and will be di-avm upwards while the lower end of the upper fragment will be dravTi inwards. If the fractm’e be below the insertion of the deltoid, the upper fragment viU be abducted by that muscle, and the lower wiU be to its iiuier side. The Treatment is of the simplest character ; flexing the elbow and applying two or three weU-padded splints, the inner one of which should be rectangular, being all that is neeessary. In these cases the elbow must be well supported, contrary to what is done in fr-actures of the surgical neck. For if, in fractui'es of the shaft, the elbow and whole of the forearm be not well supported in a sling or trough, their weight may di’ag down the lower fr-agment, cause elonga- tion of the limb, and thus lead to separation between and disunion of the fr’ag- ments. In many eases an angular outer splint carried from the acromion to the hand is the best apparatus that can be employed. In applying a sj)lint to the inner side of the arm, eare must be taken that it do not press upon the axillary vein, lest oedema of the limb occur. 3. Fractures in the Vicinity of the Elbow-joint may occur through any of the osseous prominences in this situation. They are very commonly complicated with dislocation, vdth severe contusion and injmy of the joint, or perhaps with comminution of the bones, and considerable laceration of the soft parts covering them. In most cases swelling speedily comes on, tending to obscure materially the nature of the injury. They may be classified as—Sepa- ration of the Lower Epiphysis of the Humerus ; Transverse Fracture of the Lower End of the Bone ; Fractme of either Condyle ; and to these may be added Fracture of the Olecranon. Separation of the Lower Epiphysis of the Humerus before its ossifi- cation with the shaft is complete, is a frequent accident in children ; the frag- ment being can’icd backwards, with the bones of the fore-arm connected with it, so as to cause considerable displacement posteriorly. In this accident the trochlea, the capitellum, and the condyles, are broken off from the shaft, which remains in situ. It is the detached articular end of tlie bone that is carriedSPISGIAL FllAGTUltES. 414 backwards with the fore-arm by the action of the triceps muscle. The detached ft-ao'ment may readily be replaced ; but, as soon as it is left to itself, it aj^ain slips out of Its position. As this happens without crepitus, owing to^^the tractm^ being between cartilagnnous surfaees, the injmy is apt to be mistaken for dislocation ot the fore-arm backwards. Transverse Fracture of the Lower End of the Humerus, just above the condyles, occasionally occurs in adults. The displacement backwards of the fore-arm and lower fragment, the pain, and crepitirs, indicate the nature of the accident. Fracture of either Condyle of the Humerus may arise from blows and falls on the elbou'. There is considerable pain about the seat of the injury, but usually not much displacement; unless, as in Fig. 160, there be a transverse fr'acture of both condyles, constituting what may be termed the T-shaped Fig. 160.—T-sliaped Practuru oC Lower Epiphysis of Humerus. Fig. 101.—Angular Splint applied to inside of iVrm. fracture of the lower epiphysis of the humerus. Crepitus, however, may readily be felt by rotating the radius, if it be the external condyle that is injined; or by flexing and pronating the fore-arm, if it be the internal condyle that has been detached. The Treatment of all these injuries must be conducted on very similar prin- ciples. The swelling and inflammatory action, which rapidly supervene, usually require local antiphlogistic treatment, and the application of cold lotions, or of irrigation; the arm being flexed, and supported in an easy position on a proper sphnt. After the subsidence of the swelhng, the fr-actured bone, what- ever be the precise nature of the injmy, is best maintained in position by being- put in an angular sphnt applied to the inner side of the limb (Fig. 161); the fore-arm being kept in the mid-state between pronation and supination, and well supported in a sling. It is in these particular fractmes that passive motion should behadrecomse to early, a tendency to rigidity of the joint being other- wise often left. The motion should be begun in adults at the expiration of a month or five weeks ; in children, at the end of three neeks aftei the oecurrence of the accident. Union usually takes place readily. I have, ho^v- cver, seen one instance of an imunited fr’acture of the external condyle of the humerus in a boy about ten years old.

WrdST-BnOP AFTER FRACTURED lIUiMERUS. 4T5 the shaft of the humerus, it may happen that the truiilc of the musculo-spiral nerve, where it winds round the bone in a flat o-roove, may be so seriously damaged, cither by the fracture itself or in the subsequent formation of callus as to occasion its paralysis. So also Avhen the fractm-e is lower down, and the external condyle is broken off, the posterior interosseous branch of that nerve maybe injured. A^^icntbc main trunk is paralysed, supination is im- perfect, and extension of the hand and fingers is entirely lost; the fore-arm becomes pronated, and the hand and fingers passircly flaccid, so that a pe- culiar fonn of ivrist-clrop ensues; all the muscles supplied by the musculo-spiral nerve becoming paralysed. Some de- gi-ee of supination, howeyer, can be done by the action of the biceps. Although the extensors of the wrist and fingers have become paralysed,' yet, when the fingers are flexed into the palm (Fig. lC>2a), they can be extended rapidly, and A\ith some degree of force, from the second phalangeal articu- lations, as far as is represented in Fig. 1G2&. This limited movement of extension is due to the action of the interossei and liunbricales muscles, which, being supplied by the ulnar and median nerves, do not participate in the para- lysis that affects all the long extensors of the fingers. M. Duchenne de Boulogne maintains that the interossei muscles extend the second and third phalanges and flex the fii-st phalanx, the extensor commmiis acting only on the first phalanx. When the posterior interosseous nerve only is paralysed, the loss of supination and extension is necessarily not so complete as when the whole trunk is affected; these movements being still practicable to a limited extent, through the medium of the long supinator and the long extensor of the ’^u’ist, which are supplied by the radial branch. If the paralysis of the extensors and supinators be allowed to continue for some time, the fore-ann and hand become drawn into a state of permanent flexion and pronation, by secondary or so- called pathological shortening of the muscles that act in those directions (Fig. 1(!3). The Treaimmt of this complication of simple fr-acture of the humerus must be conducted on the following prin- ciples : 1. The support of the wrist, hand, and fingers in a hand and arm- splint, so as to prevent the tonic contraction of the flexors ; 2. Placing the limb in the mid-state between pronatioTi and supination ; and ;•>. The application of electricity (fiira- disation) to the affected muscles. In order to overcome the flexion of the hand and fingers, the splint (Fig. IGl) Fig. 1G3.—Peniianeiit Flox- Tire from P.aralysi.s after FractiU'e of Humerus.

In a case in which the symptoms denoted prcssime on the musculo-spiral nerve by one of the fragments or by the callus, Olficr of Tjyons cut down on the bone, removed a portion of the callus by chisel and mallet, so as to expose the nerve, and excised also a portion of bone (apparently of the lower fr’agment), which ■was strangulating the nerve. Gradual improvement took place; and, at the end of six and a half months, the patient liad regained considerable power of extension of the carpus. Compound and Comminuted Fractures of the Elbow-Joint arc neces- sarily serious accidents. They are commonly occasioned by falls on the point of the olecranon, which is the process of bone most frequently and extensively fractiued. In some cases the olecranon escapes injury, whilst the lower epiphysis of the hmnerus is splintered into many pieces ; and more commonly, perhaps, both bones, uhia as well as himierus, are injmed. As the integu- ments over the point of the elbow are thick and hard, very extensive com- minution of the bones may occur with very little apparent injury of the soft part's. When these fractimes are the result of gun-shot injury, the soft parts may be extensively tom, and the bones greatly shattered. In the cases that occm- in civil practice, I have seldom seen much laceration of the of these important accidents must necessarily depend upon the amoimt of injmy done both to bones and to soft parts. If the articu- lation be simply opened with little laceration of the sun-ounding soft parts, and no comminution of the fractured bone, the limb may very commonly be saved by antiseptic and active antiphlogistic treatment. If the bones be much shattered, the soft parts not being seriously implicated, removal of the splinters and resection of the injured joint wiU enable the Surgeon to save the rest of the hmb But if the soft parts be extensively contused and torn, as well as the bones comminuted, amputation of the arm may be required. If recourse be not had to primary resection, abscess may form m front ot oi aroumrthe joint, with much constitutional distm-bance, requiring the removal of the articular osseous extremities in a few weeks, or possibly amputation of the hmb men resection is detennined on, either as a primary oi as a secondary operation, the question may arise whether a partial or a complete removal of the articulation should be practised.

Fractures of the Fore-arm.—1. The only fracture of the bones ot tne fore-arm that commonly occurs in the vicinity of the elbow-joint, is that of the Olecranon; this almost invariably happens from falls upon the elbow, and hence is usually accompanied by very considerable bruising and swelhng of the parts. It may possibly, though very rarely, occur from musculai- action. The displacement is usually considerable, the detached fr-agment being drawn upwards by the triceps muscle. OccasionaUy, however, when the hgamentous expansion of the tendon of this muscle is not torn through, there is but little separation of the fr-agments. In the majority of cases, as the injury takes place fr-om direct violence, there is much swelling about the joint; and not unfr-equently the fracture is comminuted or compound. The Treatment is best conducted by moderately straightening the ann, and maintaining it in that position by means of a weU-padded light wooden sphnt laid along its fore part. But, although the arm should be kept nearly straight, it should not be quite extended. The best and most easy position in which to put it up is that into which the arm natimally falls when extended ; in this there will be seen to be slight flexion at the elbow (Fig. 165). If the fore-arm be too rigidly extended on the arm, it may be carried backwards beyond the straight hne, owing to the loss of the resistance of the olecranon against the fossa at the back of the humerus. In Compound Fracture of the Olecranon, when an attempt is made to save the joint, and where there is the possibility of ankylosis, the semi- flexed would be preferable to the straight position. In such cases, the antiseptic method should be used. If this fail, excision of the joint may be required. Fracture of the Coronoid Process of the Ulna has been supposed by many Surgeons to be a common complication, and, indeed, a cause of disloca- tion of the ulna backwards. There is every reason, however, to believe that t is is an error, and that, in point of fact, it is one of the rarest accidents in smgeiy at least, we must come to this conclusion, if we are to judge by the small number of recorded cases or of preserved specimens of this injiuy. amilton states that there are but eight cases on record in which the symptoms e to a behef that this accident had occiUTcd ; that in none of these cases Mere the symptoms imoquivocal, but in all open to doubt; and that in not one case did chssection afford an opportunity of positively demonstrating this acturc.^ There are but foirr preparations in existence, according to Hamilton, E T34i8 SPECIAL FRACTURES. illusfci-fifcive of this injury, and all these, he says, are doubtful. In the cases in which this accident has been supposed to have occurred, the injury has arisen from falls on the palm of the hand, by which the ulna has been driven backwards, and the coronoid process, striking against the lower end of the Immerus, sph'ntered off. In a case related by Liston, the injury is said to have been produced by muscular action in a boy, who, hanging for a length of time by his hands from a high wall, fell to the ground, and was supposed to have met Avith this fracture. Whether the fracture actually occuiTcd is doubtful ,- and, if it did, it is still more doubtful whether it Avas occasioned by the con- traction of the brachialis anticus muscle, or by the violence of the fall. In the present uncertain state of oiu’ knowledge, I forbear to speak of the supposed symptoms of this accident. If it were suspected, the proper treat- ment Avonld consist in placing the limb in angular splints. 2. Fractures of the Middle of the Fore-arm are of very common occurrence, both bones being usually broken, Avith much shortening, angular' displacement, and crepitus. Occasionally one bone only is fractined, from the application of direct Auolence. "^^Tien this is the case, more attention will be' required in establishing the precise nature of the injury. The Treatment is simple ; a sphnt someAvhat broader than the arm shoidd be placed on each side of it, and a narrow pad laid along the interosseous space, in order that the patency of this may be preserA’ed ; no bandage shoidd be placed imder the splint. If masses of callus happen to be throAvn out across the interosseous space, pronation and supination of the hand will be lost, and the ntdity of the limb greatly impaired. Compound Fractures of the Fore-arm seldom give much trouble or- require amputation, but they very commonly lead to obliteration of the inter- osseous space, and thus impair the utility of the limb, by preventing pronation and supination. 3. Fractures of the Lower Extremity of the Radius, near the AVi'ist,. are A'ery frequent. Their importance, not only from a diagnostic point of Anew, but also in reference to treatment, has caused them to be carefully studied ;■ and their natiu-e and pathology have been specially investigated by Codes, Goyi-and, Voidermier, N^laton, E. W. Smith, and Gordon. The lower end of the radius is liable to several different kinds of fractoe. The more common of these is that which is generady caded “ CoUes’ Fracture,”' from the eminent Siu’geon Avho first fully described it. In this fi’actine the car- pal end of the radius is broken across, nsuady by a fad on the palm of the hand, the lower fragment being displaced backwards. Dr. Gordon, who has bestowed o-reat attention on the mechanism and treatment of this fr'acture, states that, in twenty-seven old specimens examined by him, the due of fracture posteriorly varied from f to If inch, and anteriorly fr-om f of an inch to trvo inches above the carpal border of the radius, being in ten of the cases one inch and under, in ten more than one inch but not over If inch, in the others rnrde- finable. The fracture is usually obdqrre fr-om before backwards. Besides Codes’, other fractures are met Avith in this situation. I hey are of three kinds ;• 1, Simple Transverse ; 2, Avith Comminution of the LoAver Fragment; and 3, with firm Impaction of the Upper into the LoAver Fragment. The S'hjns of fracture of the loAVcr cud of the radius vary greatly, according-419 DEFORMITY IN FRACTURED RxiDIUS. to their nature. Mien simple, there is usually no very great displacement; but there -n-ill be noticed some timiefiiction about the mist, a swelling at its dorsal aspect, loss of the morement of the radius, and crepitus on rotating the bone Avhilst the hand is drawn down. A\'Tien the fracture is comminuted, and still more so when impacted, the signs are very marked and characteristic ; so Fi{j. 160.—Fracture of Lower End of Radius : Side View. much so, that they may always be looked upon as diagnostic of these forms of this accident. The de- formity thus occasioned gives rise to a remarkable undular distortion of the wrist. On looking sideways at the hand and fore-arm ivhich are held midway be- tween supmation and pronation, it will be seen that there is a considerable dorsal prominence apparently situated just above the back of the carpus (Fig. 166) ; inmiediately underneath this, on the palmar aspect of the wi’ist, just opposite the aimular ligament, there is a remarkable hollow or arch, confined to the radial side of the arm ; a little above this, that is to say, on the lower part of the anterior aspect of the fore-arm, there is another rounded prominence, not nearly so large or distinct, however, as the one on the dorsal aspect. The hand is abducted and rotated outwards, so that its axis is oblique to that of the forearm ; the ulnar border being somewhat convex, and the styloid process of the ulna projecting sharply mider the skin (Fig. 167). ^ The radial side of the wrist is, on the contrary, somewhat con- cave, appearing to be shortened.

The Cause of the particular Deformity that is observed, and indeed the general pathology of the injmy, has been the subject of much discussion ; in a gveat ^asine owing, I believe, to the rarity of the opportunities of dissecting recent c uies of this kind. Surgeons are, however, noiv agreed that the dorsal nro- nllf.o!rn the lower fragment, canying the cai-pus with it, being dis- wn- upwards ; whilst the palmar tumefaction is due to the in openuon .'T 1 displacement oper.,tion. ai,o displacement of tlic tipper fragment is evidently due to E 13 2 I420 SPECIAL FRACTURES. the pronatorcs quadratiis and radii teres ; but to what is the displacement of the lower fragment due ? Is it to the peculiar manner in which the two fr’ag- ments arc locked into one another ? or is it due to muscular action ? Some years ago I had an opportunity of dissecting and carefully examining the state of the limb in a woman who died of paralysis in University College Hospital, Fig. i68.-Fi-ac- backwai’ds, can’ying the hand with it. To this fr-agment were o^^Eadius'rMs'^ attached the supinator longus, and part of the pronator This case presented the appearance usually met with in this kind of injury ; the lower fr-agment being displaced in such a way that its articular sm-face looked slightly upwards, backwards, and somewhat outwards, so as to be twisted as it were\pon its axis. The upper fragment was foiuid in a state of pronation, and was driven into and firmly impacted in the lower one. i That the deformity in this case was the result of impaction, there could be i no doubt; and that impaction is the cause of defoimity in many cases, is I proved by an examination of several specimens of consolidated fr-actme of the i radius preserved in the different coUections in London, and by the difficulty of ; accounting in any other way for the occasional impossibility of properly reduc- : incr these fractures.

On examining the left arm, which presented all the signs of this injin-y in a marked degree, and from which Fig. 108 was taken, a transverse fractm-e of the radius was found about an inch above its articular smface. The lower fr-agment was split into three portions, between which the upper fr-agment was so firmly impacted to the depth of more than half an inch, as to require some force in its removal. The three portions into which the lower fr-agment was split were of very unequal size ; the two posterior ones being small, consisting- merely of scales of bone; the third fr-agment, the largest, comprising- the whole of the articular Fig. 169.—Fmctm-e of Lower End of Radius : Displacement of Lower Fragment. surface of the radius, Vhich was somewhat tilted upwards and Ui jrvtiu.ius y AjLo placement of Arti- cular Surface. quadratus; the ligaments and capsule of the joint were miinjured. not carried to the full extent at the moment of danger.fracture'OF THE LOWER END OF THE RADIUS. 421 three-quarters pronated—not Avholly so. The effect of this position is, that the ulnar border is slightly directed do-\vnwards and first comes into contact with the ground, and the fracturing force is directed in a line that is somewhat out- wards, or towards the radial side, as well as backwards and upwards. Hence the hand is di'ivcn from the ulna towards the radius, causing the strongly marked projection of the styloid process of the ulna ; and, the radius being broken across at its lower end, the fragment carrying with it the carpus and hand is driven backwards, upwards, and slightly outwards, causing the double dcfonnity of a projection at the back of the forearm immediately above the carpus, and the concavity along the outer line of the radius. But if, as sometimes happens, the hand be completely and forcibly pronated at the moment when it touches the groimd, then the shock, which is principally received on the ball of the thiunb and the radial side of the wrist, is not directed inunediately upwards in the axis of the radius ; but the force impinges in a direction obhquely from before backwards, and fr’om without inwards, as well as from below upwards, and thus has a tendency, as soon as the bone is broken, to rotate the lower fragment on its own axis, and to tilt the articular surface somewhat upwards and outwards. As the upper fragment descends, its posterior surface of compact tissue is forced into the cancellous structiu’e of the lower fragment to such a depth as will admit of the two posterior portions of compact tissue coming into contact; and thus the upper hne of compact tissue is ch’iven into the lower fragment, to an extent coiTesponding to the degree with which the fragment is rotated upwards and backwards. If the bone be brittle, or the force be continued after this amount of impaction has taken place, the lower fragment wdl he sphntered. The prominence of the styloid process of the ulna in these cases is the result of the shortening of the radial side of the wrist and hand, consequent upon the impaction. When the fractiwe is simple, or when it is comminuted without impaction, I agi’ee with B. W. Smith that the displacement of the lower fragment is the result of muscular action alone. This I have had an opportunity of observing in the following case. A man, 64 years of age, fell to the groimd fi’om a height of twenty-five feet. In his fall he broke the left radius just above the wrist, but also met with such serious injuries of the pelvis and abdomen, that he died in an hour after admission into the Hospital. On carefully dissecting the arm about twenty-four horns after death, I found that the radius was fractured transversely about half an inch above its lower articular end, and that the lower fragment was completely comminuted. The wrist, which presented all the signs of this fractme in a very marked, but not an extreme degree, could not be restored to its normal shape by any amount of traction that I could employ. On exposing the muscles of the limb, it was found that the supinator longus was attached to the lower, and the pronator quadratus to the upper fragment; the latter muscle being slightly lacerated at its lower part. The upper fragment was strongly pronated. The chief cause of displacement, and the main obstacle to reduction, was found to exist in the two radial extensors of the wrist, the tendons of which were excessively tense ; next to these, the special extensors of the thumb presented most tension, and then the supinator longus, which was far less tense than either of the other sets of muscles, but422 SPECIAL FP AC TUBES. especially fclian tlic i-aclial extensors, the tendons of which • , ' vvv-'wivyAL »»<io L/llcUJlUU. LU come into play. In another case which I have since dissected, the muscles chiefly at fault Avere the radial extensors ; next to these the extensors of the thumb ; the supi- nator lougus being but slightly if at all contracted. Besides this injury, E,. W. Smith has described a fracture of the lower end of the radius in consequence of falls upon the back of the hand, in which the inferior fragment is displaced forwards. In these cases the character of the deformity indicates the natine of the injiny. It can readily be reduced, with a feeling of crepitation, by traction. In another variety of fracture in this situation, the lower end of the radius and that of the ulna are broken off, resembling very closely dislocation of the wi’ist backwards. But the existence of grating, the ready reduction of the swelling, and the attachment of the styloid processes of the radius and of the ulna to the carpus, with which they move, will be sufficient to establish the diagnosis. The Treatment of the ordinary fracture of the radius near the wi’ist is best conducted by the apparatus (Figs. 170,171). This consists of a pistol-shaped wooden splint, which is placed along the outside of the arm, reaching fi’om the elbow to the extremity of the fingers. Forcible extension and counter- extension should be practised, with the view of disentangling the ft-agments, and removing the dorsal prominence. The splint should be cai’efuUy padded, the padding being made thicker opposite the lower fragment, and then, noth the straight portion held vertically, the head of the splint should be fixed to the back of the hand. Gentle extension should then be made, and the hand bent to the ulnar side by raising the straight portion of the splint to the horizontal Fig. 170.—OW Pistol-Splint for Treatment of Fi'actiu'e of the Lower End of the Eadius.TREATMENT OF FRACTURED' RADIUS. 423 Tjosition, so as to make it lie against the back of the foreann, and held theie, ivhile another straight splint, extending from the elbow to the lower end of the upper fragment, is placed on the inner side of the forearm. Both sphnts should then be fixed by means of a roUer, care being taken to have the inner sphnt well padded along the radial border, so as to counteract the tendency to pro- nation of this part of the bone. The arm must then be placed in a sling. The pistol-splmt should be worn for a fortnight or thi’ee weeks. At the end of this time a gauntlet of gutta-percha, or other plastic material, may be moulded to the UTist and worn instead of the splint. All apparatus should be discontinued at the end of five weeks in the adult, one week earlier in childi’en. When the fr’actiue is impacted, little if any alteration in the deformity can be produced. When it is mobile, it may usually be brought into good position. The fractiue unites in the coiuse of a month or five weeks. After the fii’st few days it is well, especially in elderly jieople, to leave the fingers fr’ee, and to encoiu’age movement in them, lest that painful stiffness Kg- m.-Pistoi-spimt shaped to hand, result which is so common a secpiela of the accident. Passive motion of the joint may, however, often be commenced earher than the miion of the fracture, with great advantage to the pa- tient, more particularly when the fractiu’e is impacted. It is often fidly three months before the stiffness of the hand and vuist is so far diminished, even by the use of friction and douches, as to enable the patient to use the fingers, the stiffness of the wi'ist being often due to the extension of a fissure into the joint. It sometimes happens that ( in both arms the radius is broken at the same time in this situation, con- stituting a somewhat serious condi- tion, inasmuch as the patient is not able to feed or assist himself in any way during the treatment. The accompanying Figs. 172 and 173, represent two fomis of splints that have justly many advocates, \iz., Gordon’s and N61aton’s. I have, however, obtained such excellent results from the use of the “ pistol ” splint, that I have not found it necessary to adopt any other plan of treatment. Fig. 172.—Gordon’s Splint.

In the Treatment, rest of thc^ pait upon a leather, gutta-percha, or pasteboard splint is all that is requisite. In compound fractine of these bones, every effort should be made to save the part; if removal become necessary, it should be to as limited an extent as possible (p. G8). FRACTURES OF THE PELVIS AND THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Fractures of the Pelvis.—The danger here depends not so much on the extent of the fi’acture as on its complication ivith internal injiuy, and on the degree of violence ivith which it has been inflicted. Fracture may extend in any direction across the pelvic bones, though most commonly it passes through the rami of the os pubis and ischium, and across the body of the ilium, near the sacro-iliac articulation. In some cases the symphysis is broken through, and in others the fractiu’e extends across the body of the pubic bone. It occasionally happens that a portion of the crest of the ilium is broken off; but this is of httle consequence, even though the bone continue depressed. When the rami of the os pubis and ischium, or the whole body of the ilium, are broken thi’oiigh, there is, of coimse, considerable danger of internal injuiy. If the patient escape this, the fractine, however extensive it may he, may unite favomably. A patient, under my care at the Hospital, had a frac- tm’e extending through the rami of the pubes and ischium in front, and across the ihiun behind, in a line parallel vdth and close to the sacro-ihac symphysis, so as completely to detach one half of the pelvis; he recovered, however, mthout any bad consequences occurring. The natine of the injmy is usually apparent from the great degree of direct violence that has been inflicted upon the part; from the pain that the patient experiences in moving or in coughing ; from the impossibihty to stand, in consequence of a feehng as if the body were falhng to pieces when he attempts to do so ; and from the ready mobihty of the part and crepitus on seizing the brim of the pelvis on each side, and moving it to and fr’o, or on rotating the thigh of the affected side. In examining a patient with suspected fractine of the pelvis, care should, howev^er, be taken not to push the im'estigation too closely, lest injuiy be inflicted by the movement of the fragments. In those cases, indeed, in which the fraoture does not extend completely across the pelvis, or in which it is seated in the deeper parts of the’ ischium, an exact diagnosis may be impossible. In fr-actured pelvis, the principal soinces of danger ai’ise from injiuy to the bladder and inethi-a, ivith consequent extravasation of mine ; from laceration of the rectum, or fr-acture of the acetabulum ; and in examining the pelvis no rough handhng should be allowed, lest injmy to the pelvic organs be inflicted by the fragments. In the Treatment, the first thing to be done is to pass a catheter into the bladder, in order to ascertain the condition of the minary apparatus ; if it be injured, recomse must be had to measures that will be described in speaking of laceration of the methra. The next thing is to keep the part perfectly quiet, so as to bring about union. With this vflew, a padded belt, or a broad flannel roller, should be tightly apphed round the pelvis, the patient lying on a hard mattress. The knees may then be tied together, and a leather or gutta-FliACTURES OF BONES OF FELVIS. 425 Dercha splint put upon the hip of the side affected, so as to keep the joint quiet, and to prevent all displacement of the fragment. If the imcthra have been lacei-ated, it must be borne in mind that, however completely the patienc may recover from the fracture, he Aiill most certainly become the subject even- tually of the most troublesome and intractable form of urethral stricture—the traumatic. Fracture of the Acetabulum is an accident that can only occm- as the result of vciy great \'iolence directly applied to the hip. It may take place in two situations ; cither through the floor of the cavity, or only through the rim, a portion of which is detached. It is probably occasioned in most instances by the head of the thigh-bone being diiven forcibly against the surface of the acetabuhmi. Hence, ivhen the rim is broken, it is usually the posterior part that is detached, and the head of the femur slips out upon the dorsum ilfi. Fractiue through the floor of the acetabuhmi is usually complicated with extensive comminution of the pelvic bones and serious internal injiuy, so as to be followed by death. In the University College Museum is a preparation of a fr-actiu’c of the acetabulum, ivith comminutiou of its floor and of the ilium. Sanson and Sir A. Cooper have seen the bone resolved into its three primitive fr-agments ; and in some cases the comminution has been so great that the head of the femur has been thrust into the pelvic cavity. In such extensive and grave injmies as these, the Surgeon can do little more than support the pehds ivith a padded belt, and place the limb on the long splint. When a portion of the rim of the acetabulum is detached, as the result of direct violence, the head of the femiu will shp out upon the dorsum ilii, or into the sciatic notch, and the signs of iho-sciatic dislocation manifest them- selves. In a case of this kind, which was under my care at the Hospital in a muscular man aged about thirty, the shortening and inversion of the hmb and displacement of the head of the bone into the sciatic notch, were aU weU marked. Traction readily effected reduction, with distinct crepitus ; but, as soon as extension was discontinued, the head of the bone slipped back into the sciatic notch. The diagnosis in this case was made, and in similar instances may readily be effected, by attention to three circumstances :—the dislocation, its ready reduction with crepitus, and its immediate retiun when the limb is left to itself. The Treatment consists in the appheation of the long sphnt with a broad padded belt, so as to seciue steadiness of the head of the bone. But vith every care a return of displacement ^viU readily take place, and an unsatis- factory result can scarcely be avoided ; shortening of the limb, and consequent lameness, being almost inevitable. Fractuees of the Sacrum are excessively rare, except as the result of gun-shot injiuy. When occiming fr-om other causes, such as falls, they are almost invariably associated with fracture of the pelvic bones, and then they have always been fatal. The records of surgery contain but a very few obser- vations, probably not more than six or eight, of uncomplicated fr’acturc of the sacrum arising from other causes than gun-shot. I have had two cases of fractm-e of the sacrum under my care. Both had a rapidly fatal issue. In426 SPECIAL FRACTURES. one tlicre was also fracture through tlie pubic bone ; in the other, the sacrum ^\'as the only bone injured. In it, the fr-actiu-e was the result of a blow on the lower part of the back by the buffer of a railway can-iage. The preparation is in the University College Museum. The only other preparation with wliich I am acquainted, is one in the Museum of the College of Surgeons. These Irac- tm-es are almost invariably transverse, with displacement forwards of the upper mai-gin of the lower fragment. This was the case in both the instances under my care ; but Eicherand has published a case in which this bone was split vertically in consequence of a fall on the face ; and its crucial and multiple fracturc has been described by others. The injiuy can necessarily only arise fr-om direct violence of a severe character, and is attended by much extravasa- tion and pain, together with neiwalgia along the course of the posterior sacral nerves, which may be implicated in or irritated by the fr’acture. The Treatment would consist in the application of a padded pelvic band. The Coccyx, though more exposed, is seldom broken. But fractme of it may occur from falls backwards, or from direct blows on the part, the tip being bent forcibly forwards, and the elements of the bone separated. The pain in these cases is excessively severe, owing to the bruising of the ligamen- tous and tendinous expansions that cover the bone. It is greatly increased in sitting and walking, and in defecation. It is sometimes removed on reducing the fractured and displaced fragments by pressiun through the rectum, but may continue for months, and even longer, constituting a truly nemalgic affection of the part. South relates the case of a gentleman who broke his coccyx by sitting on the edge of a snuff-box, and Avho suffered such severe pain that he Avas obliged to Avear a pad on each tuberosity of the ischium, in order that the coccyx might be in a kind of pit, and fr’ee from aU pressme Avhen he sat. Under the term Coccydynia, Sir J. Y. Simpson has described a pauifnl affection of the coccyx and its neighbouring structures, Avhich chiefly occiu’s in women, commonly as the result of injiuy, and is often very severe and per- sistent, so as to prevent the patient fr'om sitting, or even walking Avith comfort. It is an affection that closely resembles in its symptoms the pain occasioned by fissure or ulcer of the anus and rectum. It usually ai’ises fr’om a bloAV on the part, though it appears sometimes to originate independently of any external violence. The Treatment recommended by Sir J. Y. Simpson consists in the fr’ee subcutaneous dmsion, by means of a tenotome, of the muscular and ten- dinous structures connected Avith the coccyx. The section of these structures is made first on one side, then on the other, and finally around the tip, so as completely to isolate the bone. The good effects of the operation are usually immediate, the pain ceasing at once. Fractuees oe the Thigh-Boxe are of great practical interest, from tlieir fr-equency and severity. They may occur in the Upper Articular End of the bone, in its Shaft, or in its LoAver End. In these different situations, eieiy possible variety of fr’actiue is often met Avith. 1. Fractures of the Pelvic End of the Bone may be divided into those that occur tliroicgh the Neele Within the Caj)sule of the joint, those that occui Outside the Capsule, and those that implicate the Trochanters alone. Intracapsular Fracture of the Neck of the Thigh-Bone may be eitheiFRACTURE OF NECK OF THIGH-BONE. Ar'21 simple, the bone being merely broken across ; or impacted, the lower portion of bone being driven into the upper fragment. . , • • ^ This intraeapsular fracture may almost be looked upon as a special injury of advanced life, being but seldom met noth in persons under fifty. Thus Sir A. Cooper states that, of 251 cases with which he met in the coimse of his practice, only two were in persons below this age. It may, however, happen at an early period of life : Stanley has recorded the case of a lad of eighteen, Avho met with this injury, and Hamilton has described it as occurring in a girl aged sixteen and in a man aged twenty-five. A remarkable circumstance in connection with this accident is, that it commonly happens from very slight degTecs of violence, indeed almost spontaneously. Thus, the jarring of the fiiot in missing a step in going do'wnstairs, catching the toes under the carpet, tripping upon a stone, or entangling the foot in turning in bed, are sufficient to occasion it. It is especially in women that this injiuy is met with. Cause.—The occurrence of this fr-actme in old age is owing indirectly to the changes in structure, shape, and position of the head and neck of the femur with advancing years. The cancellous structure of these parts becomes ex- panded, the cells large, loose, and loaded with fluid fat. The compact structure becomes thinned, and proportionately weakened, especially about the middle and imder jiart of the neck, which, appearing to yield to the weight of the body, is shortened; and, instead of being oblique in its direction, becomes horizontal, inserted nearly at a right angle into the shaft. In consequence of these changes in structure and position, it becomes less able to bear any sudden shock by Avhich the weight of the body is thi-own upon it, and snaps under the influence of very shght degrees of violence. "When it breaks, the capsule may remain uninjiu’ed, but the prolongation of it which invests the neck of the bone is usually torn through. In some cases, however, this cer'S’ical reflection is not ruptured, the lower portion of it especially often remaining for some length of time untorn, at last, however, giving way under the influence of the mo^'ements of the limb, or by being softened by local inflammatory action. As the violence occasioning the fracture is generally but shght, and as the vas- cularity of this portion of the bone is trifling in old people, there is but little extravasation of blood. The fr-agments are almost always so separated that the fr-actured siu’faces are not in apposition : the upper end of the lower fragment is drawn above and to the outer side of the head of the bone, and at the same time is twisted so that its broken surface looks forwards. The head remains in the acetabulum, attached by the ligamentmn teres, and sometimes preserving a connection with the lower fragment, through the mediimi of some untorn portions of the fibrous membrane iuA'esting the neck. E,. W. Smith has observed, that in some instances the two fragments become interlocked or dovetailed as it were into one another, in consequence of the line of fracture being iiTegular and dentated. Signs.—These are, alteration in the shape of the hip, crepitus and pain at the seat of injuiy, and inability to move the limb, with shortening and eversion of it. fl'hesc we must consider separately, as important modifications of each are sometimes noticed.428 SPECIAL FliACTUMES. f Shape of the Hip is evidenced by some flattening of the part, the trochanter not being so prominent as usual. This process is also approximated to the anterior superior spine of the iliimi ; and, on rotating the hmb, it is felt to move to and fro under the hand, not describing the segment of a circle so distinctly as on the sound side. The circle described by the trochanter on the injimed side is much smaller than that on the sound side. In the sound limb, the trochanter describes the segment of a circle havin" a radius equal to the length of the head and neck of the bone. On the injured side, the circle has a radius equal only to the length of that portion of the neck that still remains attached to the shaft of the bone. During this examination crepiius will usually be felt, though this occasionally i^ veiy indistinct and even absent, more especially if the limb be not well dramx doAvn at the time it is rotated, so as to bring the fractmed smfaces into apposition ; and much^am is produced by any movement of, or pressure upon, the joint. The Attitude of the Limb is so peculiar, as in general to indicate at once to the Siu’geon what has happened. There is a striking appearance of help- lessness about it. As the patient is lying on his back in bed, it is everted ; shortened somewhat, with the knee semi-flexed ; on requesting him to hft it up, he makes ineffectual attempts to do so, and at last ends by raising it with the toe of the opposite foot, or with his hands. When he is taken out of hed and placed upright, the injimed hmb hangs uselessly, with the toes pointing downwards, and the heel raised and pointing to the iimer ankle of the somid side, the patient being luiable to rest upon it (Fig. 174). In some cases, how- ever, after the fractimc has occiUTed, the patient can hft the limb somewhat, but with much exertion, from the couch on which he is lying ; or can even manage to walk a few paces, or to stand for a few minutes upon it, with much pain and difficulty. This is owing either to the cervical reflec- tion of the capsule being untorn, or else to the fr’ag- ments not being separated, having become locked into one another ; and it usually occiu’s in those eases hi which the other and more characteristic signs of this fmetm-e are not well marked. Eversion of the limb is almost an invariable accom- paniment of this fractiu’e. It is most marked in those cases in which the shortening is most considerable. This eversion has usually been attributed to the action of the external rotator muscles, which are inserted into the upper end of the lower fragment. But I eamiot con- sider this as the only, or indeed the principal cause of this position ; for, not only is it very difficult to imder- stand how these muscles can rotate outwards the limb after their centre of motion has been destroyed by the fr-actm-e of the neck of the femim, them action being rather in a direction backwards than rotatory under these cir- cumstances ; but we find that the limb falls into au everted position in those cases in which, the fructm’e being in the shaft, and altogether below' the in- Fig. 174.—Attitude of Limb in Intraoapsular Fi'ac- ture of tlie Neck of the Tliigh-Bone.FRACTURE OF NECK OF THIGH-BONE. 429 sertions of these muscles, no influence can be exercised by them on the lower frao-ment. I look upon eversion in cases of fractured thigh as not,being a result of muscular action at all, but simply the natural attitude into which the limb falls when left to itself. Even in the sound state, eversion takes place spontaneously whenever muscular action is relaxed, as during sleep, in pai-alysis, or in the dead body ; and in the iiijmed limb, in which there is, as it were, a suspension of muscular action, it ivill occur equally. Indeed, the shortening that takes place will specially tend to relax the external rotators, and thus still more prevent their influencing the position of the limb. Inversion of the foot in cases of intracapsular fracture has been sometimes noticed. I have seen two instances : Smith, Stanley, and other Sm'geoiis, have also recorded cases. This de-sdation from the usual symptoms of this injiuy has been attributed by some to the cervical ligament not having been tom through at its inner side, but that, as Stanley observes, while it may prevent evei’sion, cannot occasion inversion ; by others to the fact of the lower frag- ment in these cases being always found in front of the upper one. This cir- cumstance, which is much insisted on by E. N. Smith, appears to me to be rather the result than the cause of the inversion ; for any traction inwards of the lower fragment by the adductor muscles of the thigh would have a tendency to di’aw the upper end of this fragment to the anterior, or in other words, the imier side of the upper one. I am rather disposed to think that this inversion is owing, in some cases at least, to the external rotators being paralysed by the violence they receive from the injiuy that occasions the fractm-e, and that thus the adductors, acting vdthout antagonists, draw the thigh and vdth it the leg inwards. In both instances that feU under my observation, and in some of those that have been published, the fracture resulted from severe direct injury to the hip, and was not occasioned by the patient jarring his foot, or by any indirect violence operating at the end of the limb. The Shortening in cases of fracture within the capsule seldom exceeds, in the first instance, fr-om half an inch to an inch, depending on the extent of the separation between the fragments ; it camiot, indeed, in the eai-ly periods of the fr-actm-e, very well exceed the vddth of the neck of the bone, as the capsule is usually not torn thi-ough. After the fracture has existed some time, the capsule of the joint may yield, allowing gTeater separation between the frag- ments, and then it may amount to two, or even two and a half inches. It not uncommonly happens that the shortening, which is at first but very slight, about half an inch, suddenly increases to an inch or more ; this is accoimted for on the supposition of the cervical ligament, which had at first not been completely ruptured, at last giving way entirely ; or it may be owing to the fragments which were originally interlocked becoming separated. It is in those cases in which there is but slight separation of the fragments, and consequently little shortening, that the other signs of fi’acture are not very strongly marked, and that the patient preserves some power over the moA'cments of the limb. The Constitutional Disturbance in intracapsidar fr-acture of the neck of the femur in old people, though trifling at first, often eventually becomes con- siderable ; and the injury frequently terminates fatally, from the supervention of congestive pneumonia, an asthenic state of system, or sloughing of the natesSPECIAL FRACTURES. 430 from coiifinemenfc to bed during treatment. Hence this injury must always be considered as \cvj dangerous, and not unfrequently fatal. Mode of Union.- ihe treatment of these fi'aetm’es turns in a great measure upon the view that is taken of their mode of union, and on the constitutional condition of the patient. In some cases no union occurs, but the head of the bone remains in the acetabuliun, being hollowed into a smooth, hard, cnp- shaped cavity, in which the neck, whicli has become rounded off and polished, is received, and plays as in a socket. The union of the intracapsular fracture of the neck of the femm- takes place, however, in the great majority of cases by fibrous tissue. This is omng to two causes ; in the first place, to the circumstance (which I look upon as the most important) that the fractured smfaces are not in aiiposition with one another ; and secondly, that the vascular supply sent to the head of the bone, consisting only of the blood that finds its way through the vessels of the ligamentum teres, is insufficient for the proper production of callus. In some cases, however, bony union takes place. This can only happen when, in consequence of the cervical hgament being untorn, or the fracture being impacted, the sm-faces are kept in some degi’ee of apposition, and the vascidar supply to the head of the bone is speedily augmented by the blood carried into it through the medium of the plastic matter that is deposited between the fragments. In no other circumstance is it probable that osseous union takes place in these fine tines : hence the infrequency of its occinrence, there being in all probability not more than eighteen or twenty cases on record as hai’ing thus terminated in this coimtry. 'WTien bony imion does take place, the head of the femm will usually be found to be somewhat twisted roimd in such a way that it looks towards the lesser trochanter, owing to the eversion that has taken place in the lower fragment. Treatment.—As these fractures do not unite by bone, unless the fi’agments- be in good contact, it is useless to confine the patient to bed for any long- period, if the signs, especially the amomit of shortening, indicate considerable separation between the fragments, or if the patient be very aged and feeble. In these circumstances, lengthened confinement to bed most commonly proves- fatal by the depressing influence which it exercises on the general health, by the intercmrence of -visceral disease, or by the supervention of bed-sores. It is therefore a good plan to keep the patient in bed merely for two or three- weeks, imtil the limb has become somewhat less painful, the knee being well supported upon pillows. After this time, a leather splint should be fitted to- the hip, and the patient be allowed to get up upon crutches. There will be- lameness dming the remainder of life; but, with the aid of a stick and properly adjusted splint, but little inconvenience will be suffered. When the fragments do not appear to be much separated, there being but little shortening and indistinct crepitus, and more particidarly if the patient be not very aged, and in other respects sound and well, an attempt may be made to procme osseous union. This may be done by the application of the long thigh-splint; or, if this cannot very readily be borne, by^ the double inclined plane, Avith a padded belt strapped round the hips. This apparatus should be kept applied for at least two or three months, Avhen a leather splint may be put on and the patient move about upon crutches. During the vhole431 FRAGTVRB OF NECK OF THIGH-BONE. of the treatment, a generous, and even stimulating diet should be ordered, and the patient kept on a water-bed or cushion. In these fractures of the neck of the femur, the starched bandage u-ill often be found to be most useful. It may be applied as in fractured thigh, but should have additional strength in the spica part, and indeed may be pro^■ided with a small pasteboard cap so as to give more efficient support. In old people, this plan of treatment is espe- cially advantageous, as it enables them to sit up or even to walk about, and thus prevents all the ill effects of long confinement in bed. Extracapsular Fracture of the Neck of the Thigh-Bone is commonly met n-ith at an earlier period of life than the injmy which has just been described, being most frequent between the ages of thirty and forty, but it is also met with at advanced periods of life. It is the result of the applica- tion of gi-eat and direct violence upon the hip, and occurs equally in both sexes. In both Fig. 175.—Simple Extracapsu- lar Fracture of the Neck of the Thigh-Bone : Detach- ment of the Troohantez’. This fracture may be of two kinds ; the simple, or the imiKicted. cases the neck of the bone is commonly broken at, or immediately outside, the insertion of the capsule of the joint. The fracture is almost im’ariably comminuted ; indeed, I have never seen a case in which the gveat trochanter was not either detached or siihntered into several fragments. In many instances the lesser trochanter is detached, and the upper end of the shaft injined (Fig. 175). This splintering of the tro- chanter is owing to the same violence that breaks the bone forcing the lower end of the neck into the cancellous structure of this pirocess, and thus, by a wedge-hke action, breaking it into fragments. When the neck continues locked in between these, we have the impacted form of fr-acture. The Signs of extracapsular fracture vary according as it is simple or impacted; but in both cases they partake of the general character of those of fractiu’e within the capsule. The indnudual signs, how- ever, present certain well-marked differences. The hip will usually be found much brmsed and swollen from extravasation of blood, which is often considerable. In the simple fracture, the crepitus is very cbstinct and lond, being readily felt on laying the hand upon the trochanter, and moving the limb. The separate fragments into which the trochanter is splintered may occasionally be felt to he loose. The pain is very severe, and greatly increased by any attempt at moving the joint, which to the patient is impossible. The evasion is usually strongly marked, and the position of the limb is characteristic of complete want of power in it. Inversion occurs more frequently in this fr-actin-e than in that within the capsule. Smith finds that of 7 cases of inversion of the limb in fr’actures of the neck of the femur, 5 occiUTed in the extracapsidar fractine ; and of 15 cases of intracapsular fr-acture, this condition was met with in 3. When there is much comminution of the trochanter the foot wdl commonly remain in any position in which it is placed, but generally has a tendency to rotate outwards. ^432 SPECIAL FRACTURES. The shortening of the limb is very considerable, being never less than from an inch and a quarter to two inches and a half, or three inches. The Impacted Extracapsular Fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone occurs when, in consequence of a heavy fall on the hip, the neck is broken Fi"s 176 177-Section of Impacted Extracapsular Fractures of Neck of Femiu-; showing ° ■ ’ ■ the degree of Impaction and of Splintering in different cases. across at its root, and the upper fragment is driven into the cancellous struc- ture of the lower one, often splitting up and detaching the trochanter (Figs. 176, 177). The Signs of this form of fractm-e are often somewhat negative, rendering its diagnosis and detection extremely difficult. There is pain about the hip, with Version of the foot, sometimes slight, sometimes great, and some shorten- ino-, occasionally not more than a quarter of an inch, usually amounting to about half an inch, but never exceeding one inch. There is but little crepitus —in some cases none can be detected, owing to the close interlocking of the fracrments ; and the patient can then raise the foot for a few inches off the coimh on which it is laid, and even Avalk a short distance upon it with a hobblino- motion, though with much pain. Some flattening over the trochanter is usually perceptible ; sometimes an increase in breadth from before back- wards.

The first is by means of N^laton’s line ; the second, by Bryant’s ilio-femoral triangle. Uelatou’s Diagnostic line (Big. 180, dark line) consists of a line diavn from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the tuber ischii. If the tro- chanter be at its proper level, this line ought to touch its upper border. The importance of this fine is, that when the head of the femur is in its nor- mal situation, it touches the summit of the tro- chanter in every position of the limb. If the tro- chanter be displaced in any direction, a corresponding- change in its relation to this fine will ensue. Bryant’s Ilio-femoral triangle (Fig. 180, dotted line) is formed by placing the patient in the recumbent position; then, drawing a line from the anterior superior spine of the ilium perpendicularly downwards, another line also from the anterior superior spine obliquely to the summit of the trochanter, and a third, or the base line, horizontally backwards from this to the perpendicular line, a triangle AviU thus be formed. The oblique line corresponds to the first part of N^laton’s line (Fig. 180), and may be taken, just as Ndaton’s, as the diagnostic line for dislocations of the head of the femur backwards ; whilst Bryant’s base line is the test-line for all cases in which the neck of the femur is shortened, or the head of the bone thromi upwards.

It is more difficult to distinguish between the intracapsulao' fracture and the impacted extracapsular fracture. In the former case, however, the crepitus and eversion are more marked, and the injuiy usually occurs from less chrect violence than when the fractiu’e is outside the capsule. In the latter case, also, traction cannot restore the limb to its proper length as in the former instance. Scve7-e contusions of the hip are sometimes followed by eversion of the limb with inabihty to move it, so that at first sight it might be supposed that the bone was broken. In these cases, however, the absence of immediate shortening and crepitus will always estabhsh the diagnosis. Bnt though no immediate and sudden shortening can occiu’ without fractm’e, these contusions may be followed at a remote period by shortening of the limb ft’om atrophic changes in the head and neck of the femrm. When the injured hip-joint has been the seat of chronic rheumatic arthritis, and the limb is aheady somewhat shortened before the accident, the difficulty of diagnosis becomes great; here, however, the history of the case, and the fact of the shortening not being of recent occuiTence, will be sufficient to estabhsh the nature of the injiuy. The diagnosis of these injuries from dislocations will be considered in a subsequent chapter. The Treatment of the extracapsular ft-acture may very conveniently and efficiently be conducted by means of the long sphnt, a padded belt, if necessaiy, being strapped firmly round the hips undemeath it; or the plan recommended by Sh- A. Cooper, of placing the patient on a double inclined plane, with both feet and ankles tied together, and a broad belt, well-padded, firmly strapped round the body, so as to press the fragments of the trochanter firmly against one another, will be found an excellent mode of keeping the limb of a proper length, and the fragments in contact. Occasionally the fracture extends throwjh the trochanter major and upper part of the shaft without impheating the neck of the bone. Here there is shortening435 FRACTURES OF SHAFT OF THIGH-BONE. to about tlu-ee-fourths of an inch, or an inch, with much eversion, and crepitus readily felt. This fractm-e, wiiich unites firmly and well by bone, must be treated in the same Avay as the last. Compound Fractures of the Neck of the Thigh-hone can only occiu- fi-om bullet-wounds. In these cases the choice lies between amputation at the hip-joint, resection of the injured portion of bone, or treating the case as an ordinary compoimd fracture. The choice of the Surgeon, for reasons stated at p. 233, lies behveen the latter two alternatives, which are the only ones that afford a reasonable hope of safety to the patient. Fracture of the Trochanter Major, by which this process is broken off ft-om the rest of the bone, is described by Astley Cooper, Aston Key, and N(ilaton as being always the result of direct violence. It may be simple or comminuted. The fi-agment is usually drawi upwards and backwards, rarely fonvards ; and more rarely it remains fixed by fibrous bands in its normal place. The symptoms are, separation betw^een the ft-agments ; and crepitus, which is most readily obtained by flexing and abducting the thigh and rotating it out- wai-ds, at the same time that the fragments are firmly pressed together. There is no shortening of the limb. The exact nature of the injury is often concealed by the swelling from extravasated blood. The fracture is very rare without accompanying ft’actiue of the neck. 2. Fractures of the Shaft of the Thigh-bone are of very common occur- rence ; every possible variety of the injury bemg met with here. They arc usually oblique, except in children, when they are commonly transverse, and iue often comminuted, double, or compound. The Signs are weU marked. There is shortening, usually to a considerable extent, with eversion of the limb, crepitus readily produced, and much sweUing fi'om the approximation of the attachments of the muscles. The lower fragment is always drawn upwards and to the inner or outer side of the upper one, and rotated outwards ; and when the fracture is high up there is a great tendency to angular deformity, in consequence of the projection forwards of the lower end of the upper ft-agment. In aU cases there is this forward projection, and in most an outward displacement or abduction as well of the upper fragment. But in some instances, though more rarely, it is drawn inwards as well as forwards. I have taken three opportunities of ascertaining by dissection the condition of parts that leads to the jwojection forwards and lateral displacement of the lower end of the upper fragment in fr’actiue of the femm*. The first case was that of an old man who died about three hours after meeting with a compomid com- minuted fracture of the middle and lower thirds of the right thigh-bone, and in whom eversion of the upper fragment was very distinctly marked. It Avas iound that the gluteus maximus and medius could be divided without affecting the position of the bone ; but when the gluteus minimus Avas cut across, it yielded somewhat. The pyrifonuis and external rotators AA^ere noAv felt to be excessively tense ; and, on cutting these across, the end of the fragment could at once be draAvn inAvards, all opposition ceasing. The projection forwards still remained, hoAvcver ; and this, Avhich Avas evidently due to the tension of the psoas and iliacus muscles, yielded at once on dividing them. It would thus appear that there must be a double displacement of the upper fragment; out- V F 2436 SPECIAL FRACTURES. wards, depending on the action of the external rotators ; and forwards, o^ving to the contraction of the psoas and iliacus muscles. The second case was one of displacement forwards and inwai’ds. It was that of an elderly man. who died of internal iiijm-ies about half an horn’ after meeting with fracture of both thigh-bones, at the junetion of the upper and middle thirds by the passage of a cart-wheel across the thighs and body. In this case nearly the same conditions were presented in both limbs. On the left side there was an oblique fractm-e, with shortening to the extent of about two inches ; the upper fragment was tilted forwards and rather inwards, the lower one being drawn up behind it to the extent indicated. On dividing the psoas and iliacus, the upper frag-ment could be depressed shghtly. The adductor brevis and pectineus were now seen to be tense ; on cutting them through, it could be stiU fm’ther depressed. It was now dravm strongly inwards, in con- sequence of the extreme tension of the internal rotator muscles ; on cutting them through, the fragment yielded completely. Part of the adductor mag- nus and of the adductor longus was torn. The other muscles were uninjiu’ed. When extension was made with the limb straight out, the flexors of the leg offered a slight resistance : they were divided. The vastus externus was next cut through ; the lower fragment could then be di-aum down a quarter of an inch; on dividing the vastus internus and crimeus, it yielded one inch more ; on cutting through the adductor magnus and longus, it came down three quarters of an inch more ; thus making up the two inches of shortening. On the right side, the fracture was the same as that in the other limb. The effect of the section of the different muscles was the same ; but the vastus externus seemed to take a somewhat larger share in the displacement of the lower fragment. The Treatment of fractures of the shaft of the thigh-bone may be conducted in six different ways, each of which presents advantages in particular cases ; hence an exclusive plan of treatment should not be followed. Whatever treatment is adopted, and however carefully it may be carried out, the Sm-geon must not be disappointed if, in the adult, a certain amoimt of shortening be left. This is more particularly the case where the fracture is oblique and high up : the more transverse and the nearer the condyles, on the other hand, the less mil be the hability to shortening. In children, imion may almost always be prociued mthout any shortening of the bone. But a slight diminution in the length of the hmb is in reahty of no consequence, and gives rise to no inequality of gait; the pelvis, by the obliquity it assumes, remedying this. It is only when the shortening exceeds half or tlu-ee quarters of an inch, that it is important and occasions deformity. 1. The fracture may be treated by simply relaxing the muscles of the limb. This is effected by laying it upon its outer side, flexing the thig’h weU upon the abdomen and the leg upon the thigh, and supporting the limb in this position by an angular wooden or leather sphnt, extending fr-om the hip to the knee or outer ankle, and by a short inside thigh-splint. This position I have occa- sionally adopted in fr-actures about a couple of niches below the trochanters, in which there is a great tendency to the projection outwards of the lower end o the upper fr’anTnent, and have found these cases tiiin out bettei in is way than by any other plan of treatment.437 TREATMENT OF FRACTURE OF FEMUR. 9 Extension, Avithout regard to muscular relaxation, means of Listo or Desault’s long splint and perineal band (Fig. 181), Avdl be found a mo. successM plan of treating fractures in the middle and lower parts of thigh.

It Fig. 182.—Browne’s Eiastic Catch. the perineal band occasion excoriation or undue pressure, so as to necessitate its removal, I have found advantage from keeping up extension vdth a heavy weight attached to the lower end of the sphnt. A very ingenious apphance has been contrived by my late House-Surgeon, Mr. Gr. Buckstone Broivne, for employing elastic extensions from the foot. It consists of a brass catch, such Fig. 183.—Compound Fracture of Shaft of Tliigh-hone: Treatment by Bracketed Long Splint. as are used for the strings of ivindow-blinds, attached to a Auilcanized rubber ring, which is connected with a transverse piece of wood fixed to the leg by adhesive straps (Fig. 182).

Extension of the limb by the attachment of a weight to the foot a plan of treatment employed by James, of Exeter, and perfected by Buck, of Xew York, IS a most simple and efficient means of treatment. The accompanyino- drawing (Fig. 184) iUustrates this well. The weight required for extension should vary in the adult from five to ten pounds. The counter-extending means consist of a perineal band, which should be of India-rubber tubing properly covered with muslin and fastened to the head of the bedstead by means of straps.

Suspension of the limb fr’om a splint applied along the anterior aspect, as in Fig. 185, has been recommended by N. R. Smith, of Baltimore. As a general Fig. 185.—Limb suspended from Splint by Slings, prcparatoiy to application of Holler. plan of treatment, it is not likely to be found advantageous. But it is easy totreatment of compound fracture of femur. 439 understand that, in certain cases, where injnry was done to the soft parts of the liTnh nostcriorly, it might be found very useful. C The starched or plaster bandage may be employed in most cases. In treating fractures of the shaft of the thigh-bone with the starched bandage, the followiSo- plan mil be found convenient. The limb should be evenly and thickly e°nveloped in a layer of cotton wadding ; a long piece of strong paste- board, about four inches wide, soaked in starch, must nex be applied to the posterior part of the limb, from the nates to the heel. If the _patient_ be very muscular, and the thigh large, this must be strengthened, especially at its upi>cr part by having slips of bandage pasted upon it. Two naiTower slips of pasteboard are now placed, one along each side of the limb, from the hip to the ankle, and another shorter piece on the fore part of the thigh. A double layer of starched bandao-e should now be applied over the whole, with a strong and well-starched spica.° It should be cut up and trimmed on the second or third day, and then re-applied in the usual way. With such an apparatus as this I have treated many fractured thighs, both in adults and in chil- dren, without confinement to bed for more than tliree or four days, and with little if any shortening or deformity being left (Fig. 140). The points to be especially attended to are, that the back paste- board splint be very strong, at the upper part especially, and that the spica be weU and firmly applied, so that the hip and the whole of the pelvis may be immovably fixed. A siiri'ple comminuted fractiu'e of the thigh-bone is usually best treated on the double inchned plane for the &st three weeks, after which it may be put up in the starched bandage. In fractures of the femur in chilcheu, it is often difficult to maintain good position, owing to the extreme restlessness of the patient. In such cases Hamilton recommends that a long splint be applied to the sound thigh as AveU as to the broken one. Ihe two splints are' connected together at the liottom by a transverse bar (Fig. 186). I can speak from experience of its use of the very great advan- tages of this method in young children. The Treatment of Compound and Comminuted Fracture of the Thigh-bone will vary according as the injiuy arises from gun-shot, or is an accident of ciAil life. In the former case, for reasons stated at p. 233, ampu- tation should at once be performed if the fractiu’e be below the upper third of the bone. AVhen the upper third is splintered, the result of amputation is so very imsatisfactory, that the patient ]nay have a bettor prospect of recovery if the limb be treated in splints, and an endeavour made to save it, disarticula- tion at the hip-joint in such cases being almost invariably fatal. AVhen a compound, and even a comminuted fractme of the thigh-bone, occurs from one of the common accidents of civil life, the line of practice is not so defined. The course that the Surgeon adopts must be influenced by the Fig. ISO.—Hamilton’s i)uul)lu Thigh Splliit with Cw.s.s Ihir.440 SPECIAL FRACTURES. fcrcd, amputation must be practised. But if the wound be but small, made [y peifoiation of the bone rather than by the violence which occasioned the fractiu’c, and if the vessels bo uninjured, an attempt must be made to save the lunb, which should be put up on the double inclined plane or in the lon«- bracketed splint. ” The treatment of the complication of a loound of the mean artery, femoral or popliteal, ivith and by a fractme of the thigh-bone, mil vary according as the injmy is compound or simple. Such an accident, complicating a compoimd fracture, would probably be a case for immediate amputation. If the fracture be simple, and a diffused traumatic aneurism form in the ham or lower part of the thigh, we must, in accordance with the principles laid down at page 380, ligatiu'e the superficial femoral artery; imless gangrene be supervening, or have actually supervened, when the thigh must be amputated above the fractiu’e. In discussing the treatment of these accidents, in which the question of am- putation of the thigh is raised, I cannot too strongly state my conviction that, unavoidable as it undoubtedly is in some cases, as the only alternative left to the Surgeon, this operation, when practised iwimarily for fractures of the thigh-lone, is one of the most fatal in surgery, and should accordingly not be too hastily resolved upon. 3. Fractures in the Vicinity of the Knee-Joint.—The lower end of the thigh-bone may be broken across transversely, through the line of junction between the epiphyses and the shaft, both condyles being detached. This most readily occiu’s in children, from the lower epiphyses not being as yet solidly united to the shaft of the "bone. In other cases, the fractme extends thi’ough one of the condyles, detaching it from the shaft of the bone. The readiness with which crepitus can be felt, the line of fracture made out, and the displacement removed by lateral pressure, determines at once the natime of this accident. to project backwards into the ham, while the lower end oi the upper fragment When the femiu’ is fractimed transversely immediately above the condyles, the lower fi’agment is powerfully acted on by the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and pophteus muscles, which flex it upon the tibia, causing its upper extremity Fig. 187. — lm)iaoteil Fracture of Lower End of Thigh-bone.

By putting tue limb on a^doiible inclined plane in a flexed condition the deformity is at once removed, the fractm-ed ends of the bones coming into perfect apposition, i have had several cases of impacted fracture in this situation under my care. In one, the upper fragment, which ivas very oblique, was firmly driven into the cancellous stnicturc of the lower one (Fig. 187). In another case, the condyles of both thigh-bones were splintered into a number of fragments, amongst which the shafts were impacted. Excellent union, however, took place, the skin having been uninjured. In the case from which Figs. 188 and 189 were taken, the patient fell from a great height on the bent knees. ^ In one knee, the anterior cracial ligament had torn up a piece of the tibia, to which it was attached. lu the other, the posterior crucial ligament had torn out a piece of the femur, and the bone was fissured a long way up between the condyles. Fracture of the lower end of the thigh-bone, communicating with open wound of the knee-joint, is necessarily a case for amputation. Fracture of the Patella may be the result of direct violence, when the bone is often comminuted, or eveu broken longitudinally, being split, and the joint possibly injiu’ed. But most frequently it occurs as the consequence of the sudden and -violent action of the extensor muscles of the thigh, in the attempt a person makes to save himself from falling when he suddenly slips backwards. The knee being semi-flexed, the patella rests on it only in its trans- verse axis, and is readily snapped across, much in the same way as one breaks a stick across some resisting object. All fractm:es of the patella from muscular action are transverse (Fig. 190). The patient does not break his patella in these cases by faUing upon it, but he falls because the patella has been broken by the violent and almost spasmodic action of the extensors of the thigh in his efforts to save himself. ■ In consequence of these fractures being occasioned by muscular action, they are more frequent in men, especially about the middle period of life, less com- mon in women, and extremely rare in children. I liave once, however, had under my care a child under ten years of age, who had a transverse fractm-e of the patella. It not unfrequently happens when one patella has been fractiu-ed, that the im- steadiness of gait causes the opposite one to be broken by muscular action in an effort to save a fall. The same patella may be broken more than once ; in the cases that I have seen, the second fracture has always occurred in the upper fragment, a little above the line of the original fractm-e. The Signs of this fracture arc very evident. 'When it is transverse, and has been produced by muscular action, the fibrous expansion over the bone is torn ; Fig. 190.—Diagram of position of fragments in Fracture of Patella.

When it has been s ]n-oduced hy direct violence, the muscles being at rest, there is little or no separation, even though the fracture be transverse. In such cases, and when it is longitudinal or comminuted, the crepitus and mobility of the ft-agments point it out. Immediately on the occm-rence of a transverse fracture of the patella, the knee-joint swells up owing to the effusion of blood into the synoidal membrane. This swelling sub- sides after a few days’ rest. Mode of Union. — When the bone is broken trans- versely, it very rarely indeed unites by osseous matter, in consequence of the wide se- paration of the fragments ; there are,, however, two or thi-ee cases on record in which this kind of union has taken place in these fractiu'es. In the longitudinal and comminuted fractures, osseous union readily occurs, the fragments remaining in close ajiiiosition. In the majority of cases of transverse fracture, the fragments remain separated by an interval varying fi’om one-fointh of an inch to an inch; but in some instances the gap is much gi’eater, amoimting even to fom* or five inches. l^Tien the separation does not exceed an inch and a half, the gap is usually liUed up by fibrous or ligamentous tissue, uniting the fragments firmly. In some of the cases, however, in which the separation between the fragments does not exceed this distance, and in most of those in which it extends beyond it, W. Adams has found that the fractme is not united by any plastic matter that has been thrown out, but that the fragments are bound together simply by the thickened fascia which passes over the patella, with which is incorporated the binsa patellm. Adams finds that the aponeurotic structure thus uniting the fragments may be arranged in different ways. Thus it may pass between the fragments, and be adherent to the anterior periosteal surface of both ; or the connecting aponemosis may be reflected over, and be adherent to, both the fractured surfaces ; or, lastly, (and this is the most frequent form of arrange- ment,) the connecting aponeurosis may pass from the periosteal sinface of the upper fragment of the fractured surface of the lower one, to which it becomes closely and firmly united. In the majority of cases, when united by aponem'otic tissue, the fragments ga^De somewhat towards the skin, coming into better con- tact posteriorly. Thus it would appear that a patella fractured transversely may unite in two ways ; most fi’equently by the intervention of thickened aponem’otic structure, and next, by a ligamentous or fibrous band. Of 31 specimens in the London museums, examined by Adams, it was found that in 15 aponeurotic union had taken place, in 12 ligamentous union, and in the remaining 4 the kind of union could not be determined.treatment of fractured patella. 443 The aponeurotic union always leaves a weakened limb and an unprotected joint ;:^br, in consequence of the separation of the frag-ments, the folding in ot the tascia, and its adhesion to the capsule of the joint, the fingers can be thrust in between the articular siu'faces ot the kuee. Treatment—In many cases of fractured patella, there is rather severe in- flammatory action in the knee, with gi-eat synovial effusion. This requires to be reduced by rest and the application of evaporating lotions, before any other treatment can be adopted. When this has been effected, means must be taken for the union of the fragments ; with this view, the principal point to be attended to is, to keep them in sufficiently close apposfrion for finn liga- mentous union to take plaee. The upper fragment, which is movable, and has been, retracted by the extensor muscles of the thigh, must be diawn down so as to be approximated to the lower one, which is fixed by the liga- mentimi patell®. This approximation of the fragments may be effected either l)y position and relaxation of the muscles, or by mechanical contrivance. •Simple position usually suffices for this piu’pose, and must be attended to whatever mechanical appliances are used. By placing the patient in a semi- recumbent position, and elevating the leg considerably, so as to relax the muscles of the thigh completely, the upper fragment may be brought doum to the lower one, and, if necessary, may be retained there, after any local inflam- mation that results from the accident has been subdued, by moulding a gutta- percha cap acciu’ately to and fixing it firmly upon the knee, or by the applica- tion of pads of lint and broad straps of plaster. These straps of jilaster may be applied above and upon the upper fragment in a diagonal direction from above downwards. They should be of sufficient length to embrace the limb and the back ^splint, to which they are to be fixed, or a figme-of-8 bandage may be applied round the limb and splint together. This position must be maintained for at least six weeks ; at the expiration of which time the patient may be allowed to walk about, wearing, however, an elastic knee-cap, or, what is better, a straight leather splint in the ham, so as to prevent the knee from being bent for at least three months. If this precaution be not taken, the union between the fi-agments, which at first appeared to be in very close contact, will gradually lengthen, until in the coinse of a few months an interval of several inches may l.)e found between them. In these cases, however, even though the separation between the fragments be great, it is remarkable how well the limb may be used, especially on level ground ; and with the aid of a knee-cap but little inconvenience is experienced by the patient. If the occupation of the patient is such that he cannot be kept at rest dmmg the treatment, the starched bandage will be found very usefirl, the patient being with it enabled to walk about diming the whole of the treatment, ine action of the bandage is much increased by drawing down and fixing the upper fragment by two broad strips of plaster firmly applied above it. A back splint of pasteboard is required to fix the knee, and a good pad of lint with a figure-of-8 bandage should be applied above and below the fracture to keep it m position. In several cases I have obtained very close and firm union between the fi’agments in this way, without confining the patient to bed after the third day. Various attempts have at different times been made to bring domi and to fixSPECIAL FRACTURES. 1 444 i the qiper fragment, so as to keep it in contact with the lower one; or, if this ' T l)e impracticable, to shorten the distance between them, and thus to lessen the length of the bond of union. With this view, an apparatus consisting of two broad bands of leathei^ buckled above and below the knee, and united by longitudinal stiaps, which can be shortened at pleasiu’e, is veiy commonly employed. Malgaigne, with the same view, constructed a pair of double hooks, which, being fixed into the two fragments, were drawn together by a screw ; and Eve, of Tennessee, accomplishes the same object by means of a ring passed round the fragments. All these means undoubtedly secure the object for which they are intended, and each may be found an useful adjunct to position in any given case. Malgaigne’s hooks are undoubtedly the most effectual; but the great objection to their use consists in the pain and imtation that are often induced by their penetration of the skin. Mr. Manning, late House Surgeon of University College Hospital, has made some very careful dissections of the arterial supply of the patella (Fig. 193). He ' finds that the vascular arch by which the upper fragment of a broken patella is ! supplied is situated at the very spot where the greatest amount of pressure is usually applied, and that not unff equently the internal superior and inferior articular arteries arise from a common trunk, which must in- evitably be compressed against the internal condyle of the femur, so that both fragments may thus be starved of blood ; and that this want of proper blood- supply has an additional tendency to prevent firm union. As an additional evidence of the compres- sion of the nutrient arteries of the patella by the ordi- nary apparatus, I may mention that Mr. Manning has j; found, on injecting a limb thus put up, that aU the || arteries were filled except those supplying the patella. jj In addition to this, Mr. Maiming is of opinion that, in j the ordinary treatment of fractured patella, the appa- j ratus in use does not retain the fragments sufficiently long in position, or control the muscles efficiently. With the view of remedying these inconveniences, Mr. Manning has ■ constructed the sphnt (Fig. 194), of which the following is a description. It consists of a wooden back-piece, a little wider than the knee- i joint, and long enough to reach fr’om the sole of the foot to the gluteal fold, and provided at the lower end with a foot-piece, A. At the junction of the middle and lower thirds is a transverse oblique sUt, B, one and a half inches long. Strips of strong plaster, two inches broad and , long enough to encircle the thigh and overlap by some inches, are attached i to a caheo band, C. The free end of this band is carried through the slit, and the straps of plaster are open on the upper part of the splint. A piece of wood, E, is attached to the lower part of the splint, and another piece ol coiTesponding size is attached to a loop at the end of the calico band, so^ that, when draivn down and the splint adjusted, these three pieces may be fi^ e oi six inches apart. Fig 1,93.—Arterial Supply of Patella (Maiming).TREATMENT OF FRACTURED PATELLA. 445 The foot and leg having been previously bandaged as far as the lower edp of the patella,'and the splint padded so as to leave the slit uncovered, the strapping is heated by naeans of a bottle of hot-water (which is more con- Tenient than a strapping-tin), and while an assistant ebaws down the upper fra‘^ment by grasping the muscles of the thigh, the straps of plaster are carried fii-mly round the limb from above downwards, extending from just below the o-luteal fold to wdthin three inches of the upper border of the patella. It being important that the band of calico should be kept in the middle line behind, the upper part of the thigh is then seemed to the splint by a few Fig. 194.—Manning’s Splint for Fractured Patella. turns of a roUer. Lastly, as many elastic rings (those known as “ office-bands ” answer the piu’pose very well) as will serve to approximate the fragments with- out causing too much pain to the patient, are passed over the projecting ends Fig. 195.—Manning’s Splint applied. of the pieces of wood, as at f. Fig. 195, on each side of the sphnt, so as to exercise sufficient traction on the muscles pulling on the upper fragment. Stiffliess of the knee often remains to a very inconvenient degi’ee after the treatment of a fractured patella. It is usually remedied by friction and manipulation. But should it not yield to these minor means, an apparatus consisting of a thigh-and-leg piece of stiif leather, united by angularly hinged lateral iron rods, and having an India-rubber “ accumulator ” adapted behind, should be worn. The continued traction of the “ accumulator ” will gradually flex the knee. But, as the knee becomes bent, the close union that may have appeared to exist between the fragments gradually yields, and they gape more or less widely, much to the disappointment often of both Siu'geon and patient, the ligamentous band stretching like a piece of vulcanised India- rubber. This cannot be helped. There is the alternative between a straight and stiff knee with close union, or a flexible and mobile one with gaping of "the446 SPECIAL FliACTUliES. fragments. Atter the knee is flexible, lateral hinged splints may be worn with- out the elastic strap. The limb that exists is usually perfectly strong, and good for any exercise except jumping. In Simple Comminuted Fractures of the Patella, the result of direct blows or kicks, the fragments are not much separated, and union takes place readily by bone. In these cases, after subduing inflammatory action, which usually runs high, the starched bandage may be applied, and the knee and fr-agments thus both kept immovable. Compound and Comminuted Fractures of the Patella, especially if occasioned by bullet-Avounds, and opening the knee-joint, are cases for im- mediate amputation. MTecrosis of the Patella as the result of fractm-e is rare. In one such case which was under my care at the Hospital, the patient, a middle-aged man had met with an ordinary transverse fracture of the patella, which united by ligament; two years after the accident, and without any fr-esh injury, he came to the Hospital, with necrosis of the outer half of the upper fragment, which was completely detached, and lying in a cavity bounded and shut off from the joint by plastic matter. I cut dmvn upon and removed the necrosed fragment, which appeared to constitute about one quarter of the patella. Ho cause could be assigned for the necrosis, except defective vascular supply to this part of the bone. Fractures oe the Boxes oe the Leg.—The bones of the leg are fr-e- quently broken, the fracture of the fibula being, as a rule, at a higher level than that of the tibia. When both bones are broken, the fracture is generaUv situated near the junction of the middle and lower thirds, and the lower fragments are, in the majority of cases, di’awn upwards and behind the upper by the action of the gastrocnemius muscle ; so that the edge of the upper fragment of the tiliia projects luider the skin and may perforate it. In some instances, however, the direction of the fractme is such that the lower frag- ments ride over the fr’ont of the upper. The tibia, though a stronger bone than the fibula, is most frequently fractured, owing to its being more exposed and less protected by muscles, and receiving more directly all shocks connnuni- cated to the heel. The fractures of the upper part of this bone are usually transverse, and result fr’oni direct Holence ; those of the lower part are oblique, and proceed from indirect violence. When both bones are broken, the usual signs of fr’actiu’e, such as shortening, increased mobility at the seat of injiu’y, and crepitus, render the diagnosis easy ; but when one bone alone is broken, it is not always a very simple patter to determine the existence of the fracture ; the sound bone, acting as a splint, prevents displacement, and keeps the limb of a proper length and steady. If it be the tibia alone that has been broken, the fr-actin-e may be detected by running the finger along the subcutaneous edge, imtil it comes to a point that is somewhat irregular, puffy, or tender, where by accurate examination some mobihty and slight crepitus may be detected. T\Tien the fibula alone is broken, the thick layer of the peroneal muscles, OA'erlayiug its upper two thirds, render the detection of the fracture difficult; but in the lower third it is easy, by attention to the same signs that occur in fractured tibia. In the Treatment of simple UncomiJlicated. Fractures of the Iieg,447 TRExiTMENT OF SIMPLE FRxiCTURE OF LEG. every possible kind of apparatus has been used. In the majority of cases, Avhere there is but little displacement and swelling-, ordinary leg-splints (Cline’s, well padded, are extremely convenient), are readily applied and keep the bones in good apposition. These may be kept on for the first few days till all swelling has abated, and then replaced by the starched or plaster bandages. In frac'ture of the leg, indeed, the starched bandage or the Bavarian splint is especially applicable. The starched bandage should be applied as follows. The limb having been well covered with wadding, a strong soaked pasteboard splint, fom inches broad, and long enough to extend from above the knee to six or eight inches beyond the heel, should be applied to the back of the leg. The projecting terminal piece is now to be tinned up along the sole of the foot, and two lateral strips adapted, one to each side of the limb. Over this the starched bandage, single or double according to the size of the limb, must be tightly applied. After it is dry, about the end of the Fig. 196. —M'Intyre’s Spliut, modifled by Liston. second day, it must be cut up as represented in Fig. 142, and re-adjusted, and the patient may then walk on crutches with perfect safety. MTntyi’e’s sphnt (Fig. 196) will be found of great service in the earlier periods, if there be much ecchymosis or extravasation, as it keeps the limb in an easy position, and aUoAVS the ready apph’cation of evaporating lotions. In applying this splint, there are fom’ points that require to be attended to : 1. That the angle be convenient, and suitable to the apposition of the fragments ; 2. That the aperture con-esponding to the heel be closed by a few tiu’iis of a roller hi which the heel may rest firmly, but with a certain amount of yielding pressure ; 3. That the foot be covered with a flannel sock ; and, 4. That the foot-piece be raised and steadied on a wooden block. In some cases of fr-acture of the bones of the leg, however, MTntyre’s apparatus is not applicable. This is more particularly the case when the fracture is veiy oblique, from above down- wards, and from before backwards ; in these circumstances, the fragments cannot be brought into good position so long as the limb is kept extended and resting on its posterior surface ; the bones riding considerably, and one or other of the fractm’ed ends pressing upon the skin in such a way as often to threaten ulceration. In these cases it is, that division of the tendo Achillis has been recommended, with a view of removing the influence of muscular contraction. This appears to me, however, to lie an unnecessarily severe pro- cedm’e, and certainly was not very successful in some cases in wliich I Iuia'c448 SPECIAL FRACTURES. practised it; for altliougli the tendon was exceedingly tense, only temporary beTiefit resnlted, the displacement returning under the influence of the other muscles inserted into the foot. In these cases the bones may usually be brought into excellent position by flexing the thigh well upon the abdomen, and the leg upon the thigh, so that the heel nearly touches the nates, and then laying the limb on its outer side on a Avooden leg-splint, provided with a proper Kg. 197.—Salter’s Swing-box for Fractured Leg. foot-piece, and keeping it fixed in this position. In some cases the swing-box (Fig. 197) will be foiuid an useful and very easy apparatus. In some fractm’es of the leg, the lower end of the upper fragment projects considerably, and can- not be brought into proper position so long as the knee is kept bent; but if it be extended, so as to relax the extensors of the thigh, the bone is readily brought into good position. In fractm-es of the leg, as in aU injmies of a similar kind, no one plan of treatment should be adopted exclusively, but the means employed should be varied and suited according to the peculiarities of each individual case. In the management of all fractm-es of the tibia, the foot should be carefuUy kept as nearly as possible at right angles to the leg. If it be allowed to di-op, so that the toes point, there wiU be a tendency for the astragalus to shp for- Avards from under the malleolar arch ; the ankle-joint being thus permanently weakened by the elongation of its anterior ligament. Should a traumatic aneurism form in the leg, as a consequence of injm-y of the posterior tibial artery, compression of the superficial femoral in Scarpa’s triano'le, Avith pressime by pad and bandage over the pulsating sweUing, may succeed. If not, the artery may be hgatm-ed in Scarpa’s triangle Avith good results. Two cases of this kind are recorded, one in the practice of Dupuytren, the other in that of Delpech. For the treatment of other Complications of simple Fracture of the Leg, see pp. 874, et seq. Compound Fractures of the Tibia are of more frequent occurrence than similar.injmies of any other bone in the body. This is omng to the thin covering of soft parts OA'er the anterior and miier aspect of the bone, and to the fact of its fracture being usually oblique ; so that the sharply pointed end449 COMPOUND FRACTURE OF TIBIA. * of the upper fragment is liable to be thrust through the iiitegumciit, when the lower part of the limb lalls backwards as the injured person is being raised ott the ground. The fracture may, of course, also be rendered compound by the same direct ’\-iolencc that breaks tlie bone. The Treatment and probable result of the case will in a great measure depend upon the way in which the fracture has been rendered compound, and on the amount of the laceration and contusion of the integuments. When the wound in the integmnents is the result of their transfixion by the point of the upper fragment, it may commonly be closed by the first intention, by laying over it a piece of lint soaked in blood, tincture of bem:oin, or collodion, or by using Lister’s carbolic acid dressing, after reduction has been effected, and the limb put on a MTntyre’s splint, the lint being left undistiu-bed as long as possible. Or the limb may be put up in a starched or plaster of Paris bandage, in which a trap is cut to allow the dressing of the womid, as represented in Fig. 143, Should there be difficulty in jireventing the protrusion or in effectmg the reduction of the pointed fragment, this must be cleanly sawn off, oi the wound be enlarged so as to sink it, as directed at p. 382. In the event of there being great contusion and laceration of the soft parts, as when the fractiu'e is rendered compound by a waggon-wheel passing over the leg, it is useless to adopt the routine practice of attempting to close the wound by laying over it a piece of lint soaked in blood or collodion. It cannot imite, as in the other case, by the first intention. Suppmation must take place, and this is best met at once by the application of water-dressing after reduction. Indeed, in cases of this kind, the greatest danger results to the patient from the Surgeon plastering the Avound over with a piece of lint rendered hard and impervious by dried blood, or attempting its closine in any other way. The inflammatory discharges are prevented fr-om escaping ; and unhealthy pus or broken down blood accumulates in the hmb, which becomes greatly swollen, tense, red, painful, and hot. The patient becomes restless ; high in'itative fever is set up ; and, unless relief be given by the evacuation of the pent-up discharges, by opening up the wounds freely, and perhaps by free incisions and counter-openings as weU, the worst form of pyaemia mil almost inevitably ensue. .If the tibia be much comminuted and the fracture compound, the case is usually one for amputation ; but should the patient be young and Augorons, an attempt even in such cases may be made to save the hmb. Here a good deal may be done in the Avay of picking out detached sphnters of bone, and sawing off smoothly the jagged and pointed ends of the adherent fragments. The length of the tibia will thus be lessened, and the patient AviU recover Avith a necessarily shortened, but othei’Avise fii-m and useful limb. Care must be taken in the after-treatment of such cases that too effective extension be not kept up, lest a gap be left betAveen the fr’actured ends, Avhich cannot be filled up AAoth callus ; the consequence being that, in the attempt to obtain good length of limb, want or impciffection of consolidation results. In both the last classes of cases, tension of the limb from deep abscess, possibly requiring incision, may ensue ; or the consolidation of the fractiu’C and the healing of the wound may be retarded by necrosis of some of the splinters, or of the extremity of one of the fragments, generally the loAA’er one • VOL. I. *45° HP EC IA L FRA G TUBES. iiiicl not nnfrcqucntly, after a proper but unsuccessful attempt to saA-e the limb, the profuseuess of the suppuration and the amount of constitutional debility may render imperatiA'e secondary amputation al)OA"e, at, or below the knee. Haemorrhage is a common complication of compound fractuics of the leg. When A’enoiAS and moderate in quantity, it may be airested by position and cold. When primary, arterial, and abundant, proeeeding from laceration of one of the tibials, the line of practice to be adopted must to a great extent be determined by the situation of the fracture and of the arterial wound, and the state of the soft parts. If the soft parts be much torn, and the Avound be anyAvhere aboA'e the lower third of the limb, it is useless for the Surgeon to attempt to seciu’e the bleeding A'essels by gToping amongst and under the deep muscles of the limb, infiltrated and disorganised as they are by the mjm-y and by extravasation. It is equally futile to ligature the superficial femoral artery l^'imary traumatic haBmonhage from the posterior tibial artery. Such an operation either fails in arresting the heemoiThage, or, if it stop the circulation sufficiently for this, giA'es rise to gangrene. There is, consequently, no resoince but amputation ; and the sooner this is practised, the better aavU be the patient’s chance of recovery. If, hoAvever, the fractiu'e be situated in the loAAnr third, and the artery be torn low doAAn in the fimb, where the vessels are superficial, and more especially if the injury be near the ankle-joint, an attempt might be made—provided other circumstances were favourable—to apply a hgatme to the bleeding arteiy, and thus to save the limb. This Avould be more feasible Avith wound of the anterior than of the posterior tibial artery. But useless as experience has proved the ligature of the superficial femoral to be in iiyrimary haemorrhage' from the posterior tibial artery in compound fractures, of the leg, it is othei’Avise in secondary haemonhage : in such cases that arteiy has been tied Avith good results, in seA'eral instances. Fractures in the Vicinity of the Ankle-Joint are amongst the most common injuries of the bones of the lower extremity. They are usually occasioned by tAAHsts of the foot, by catching it m a hole whilst rinming, by jumping from a height to the ground, or off a carriage in rapid motion. These fractiu'es aie usually associated with severe strain, or even disloca- tion, of the ankle. TAvist of the foot in these cases must not be confoimded Avith dislocation of the ankle. In a tAvist the foot carries with it the lower fragments of the leg-bones, and the malleolar arch in a more oi less perfect state. In a dislocation, the foot is throAvn out from under this arch. The tA\dst of the foot is almost invariably outwards, Avith the inner side down- Avards and the outer edge turned up, or the sole remains in this direction, though not ahvays to the extent that Dupuytren states, and the imiev Most commonly the toes arc turned someivhat outwards, and the heel raw aids. I'iK. li)S.—Di-siilaceineiit of IBoiiuy and Foot in Pott’s Fractuve. (Ricluird).Fig. 199.—Fractures of Tibia aud Fibula above Aukle. FRACTURES XEAR ANKLE-JOINT. 451 Fracfciu-es of tlie lower ends of tlic tibia aud fibula present four distinct varieties in degree. 1. The fibula may be broken two or throe inches above the malleolus externus, the deltoid ligament being either stretched or tom. 2. The fibula may be fractured about thi-ee inches above the anlde, the tip of the malleolus interims being splintered off as well (Fig. 198). This con- stitutes the form of injury called Pott's Fracture, and is perhaps the most common fracture in this situation. 3. The fibula may be fmctimed about throe inches above the ankle, and the lower end of the tibia at the same time be splintered off in an oblique direction from without, doimwards, and inwards (Fig. 199). 4. The internal malleolus may alone be broken off, the fibula remaining sound, but one of the divisions of the external lateral ligament being torn through. The Signs of these fr’actures vary somewhat according to the bone that is injm’ed. When the fibula alone is broken, there is but slight displacement of the foot, but great pain aud much swelling, with perhaps indistinct crepitus, aud irregularity of outline at the seat of fracture. When the lower part of the fibula is broken, pain is pro- duced at the fr’actured part by squeezing the bones of the leg together at a point distant from the seat of injury. If the tip of the inner malleolus be broken off as well, this may be ascertained by feeling the depression above the detached fragment. In those cases the crepitus is more distinct, and the displacement of the foot is much more marked, the sole being timied somewhat upwards and outwards, and the patient resting upon its inner side. It is this peculiar twist of the foot with its outer edge turned up, and the inner side doivn, that constitutes the characteristic sign of Pott’s fractiu’e. In those cases in which the lower end of the tibia is obliquely splintered, as well as the fibula broken, there are not only the ordinary signs of fracture, with eversion of the toes, and a corresponding timning inwards of the heel, and some rotation of the foot outwards, but the malleoli are widely separated, giving an appearance of great increase of breadth to the joint; crepitus is very readily felt, and a depression can be perceived corresponding to the fine of fracture. The Tieatment of these cases is always fraught with difficulty. In con- sequence of the swelling and infiammation that usually occur, it is often diffi- cult to make out the exact extent and direction of the fr-acture. This difficidty 18 greatly increased by the^ small size and short leverage afforded by the ragments ; a,nd so great is it, that in some cases it cannot be overcome by any amount of skill and patience that may be brought to boar on the treatment of e injury, but a certain degree of displacement results as the necessary con- ^quence of the injury, leaTOig a weak and painful joint, the mobility of which IS senously impaired.

When there is no twist of the foot, perhaps the best apparatus is a M‘Intyre’s splint; or the limb may be 13ut up in lateral leg-splints, with good foot-pieees, and swung in a cradle. I haYC foimd the splint.

It is in cases of fractiu-e of the lower third of the fibula, with 1 displacement outwards, or of both bones low down with tendency to displacc- I meiit backwards, that this splint will be found most useful. It may be applied to either side of the leg, as best seems to suit the case in question. Whatever \ apparatus is used, care must be taken to keep the sole of the foot nearly at a ' right angle with the leg. If the toes be allowed to point, it will be found that there is in some cases a tendency for the astragalus to roll forwai’ds, as it ■were, ' fi-om under the malleolar arch. In other instances, again, one of the sharp 1 angular fragments connected with the bone may be pressed forwards, and I uniting in this position, give rise to permanent deformity. But whatever care I be employed, or apparatus applied, it will be found impossible in some cases [ to replace one of the thin angular fr’agments, if it become twisted on its axis, \ and project shaiply under the skin. If the foot be much twisted outwards, as often happens in Pott’s fr’acture, : Dupuytren’s splint shoidd be applied to the inner side of the limb, so as to ( counteract the displacement (Fig. 201*). In applying the apparatus, three i points reqiure attention. 1. The pad should be folded double at the lower [■ end, and not descend below the ankle, so as to form a fulcrum, across which f the foot may be dravm to the inner side. 2. The bandage should not be t caiTied above the knee, but terminate just below the flexure of the joint. [ 3. The knee should be bent, so as to flex the leg on the thigh, and thus to I relax the strong muscles of the calf, which, by drawing up the heel, and Fig. 201*.—Application of nupuj'tren’s SiiUnt in Pott’s Fractiu'e causing the toes to point doivnwards, offer a serious obstacle to the maintenance of the foot in a good position. Much stifihess always left after union has taken place, the ankle remaining rigid, weak, and useless for a long time. In Pott’s fractme, where the malleolar arch is spht through, a peculiar de- formity is apt to residt, consisting of widening of the lower end of the leg by separation of the malleoli. The astragalus is driven upwards, the shaft ivith the inner malleolus projects somewhat to the inner side, whilst the outer half of the malleolar arch is earned outwards with the lower end of the fibula. The transverse line between the maUeoli is increased by half an inch. Compound Fracture into the Ankle-joint is necessarily a serious and dangerous accident. In this injury, the edge of the fractmed bone cuts through the integument by apparently a clean and simple Avound, but the subjacent areolar tissue is widely torn, and extensive inflammation and suppmation are apt to set in. The deep-seated mischief is far more extensive than that Avhich the Surgeon Avould bo led to expect from the small and clean-cut wound. Nevertheless, the injury, eA'en though severe, may often be recovered from Avitli a good and useful limb, Avhen occurring to young subjects of sound constitution.SPECIAL FRACTURES. 454 As age athanccs, however, and the constitution becomes broken, less is to be exjDectcd fi’om conservative surgery. In the Ti eatment, the course to be pin'sued will depend upon the extent of the injuiy. It the fracture be not much comminuted, the wound in the soft 23iUts clean cut and but moderate in extent, and the large ■'i'cssels of the foot uninjured, an attempt should bo made to save the limb. But if there be great comminution ot bone, with dislocation of the toot, and ^icrha^is ruptm’c of the posterior tibial artery, in a person at or above the middle period of life, ampu- tation should be jiractised. In a young subject, such a serious injury even as this may be recovered from, if the Smgeon remove loose fragments, saw olf the sjilintered ends of the bone, and bring the soft parts together. If an attempt be made to save the limb, whether any bone have been excised or not, it should be jilaced secimely in a McIntyre’s splint (Fig. 190), and kept immovably fixed; j)crfect fixity of the limb is here of the first consequence. If much of the fibula should requme removal, Stromeyer has recommended that the limb be amputated instead, lest an useless foot, affected with a kind of valgus, be left. But, in children and young subjects, this inconvenience and deformity may be overcome by mechanical means ; and the iirobability of its occmi-ence would not, in my oiiinion, justify amjiutation. In badly set fractures near the ankle-j oint, great defoimity with much impairment of use of the foot may result. In these cases the inner malleolus will be found to jpi’oject greatly, the fibula to be ciuved inwards above its lower third, so as to form a concavity above the external malleolus, and the foot to be somewhat tinned outwards (Fig. 202). I have in two instances of such iU-set fr-actures succeeded in removing the deformity to a considerable extent, even after as lengthened a period as a year and a half or two years, by dividing the fibula subcutaneously by means of a narrow-bladed saw at the seat of greatest concaidty, forcibly adductmg the foot, and then putting up the fractme in a Dupuytren’s sphnt. Feactuebs OB THE BoHES OB THE FooT almost invariably result fr-om duect violence, and are usually accompanied by bruising and injuiy of the soft parts ; hence much displacement is rare, and, when the frac- tiue is sim2>le, rest and position alone are necessary. Compound fr-actm’es of the tarsal or metatai’sal bones, attended by much bruising and laceration, usually require partial removal of the foot, its disai’ticulation at the ankle-joint, or amjjutation in the lower third of according to the extent and severity of the injury. The Calcaneum may be broken by direct violence, as when a person jumping fr-om a height alights forcibly on his heel, and thus Ifactiu-es the bone. In this .way the bone is usually simply broken across in front of the ligaments without displacement. I have, however, seen both calcanea extensively com- minuted, being shattered to jiieces, in the case ol a lady, who, falling from a window on the third story, alighted on her heels. In some laie cases, by the Fig. 202.—Badly set Pott's l*t'ac- tiu'e, curable by operatiou. the leg,FllACTURE OF THE ASTRAGALUS. 455 powerful contraction of the strong muscles of the calf, the posterior part of the os calcis is torn away from the rest of the Ijone. ^ • . .f _When the os calcis is shnply broken through at its posterior part behind the insertion of the lateral ligaments, the detached fragment will be ch-awn up by the action of the strong muscles of the calf. But when the ti-ac- ture occui-8 across the body of the bone, no displacement can take place, Giving to the lateral and interosseous ligaments keeping the posterior fragments in position, and preventing its being drawn away. In the fii’st form of fractm-e, the pain, swelling, flattening of the heel, and prominenee of the maUeoli, indicate the natine of the injury, even though crepitus be wanting. In the second vai’iety, the mobility of the fragment, and its projection posteriorly by the action of the muscles of the calf, point to the existence of the fractme, which is confii’med by the occmrence of crepitus. In the Trecdmeni of these injmies, subduing inflammatory action, keeping the part fixed by means of bandages and splints, with due attention to the re- laxation of the muscles attached to the tendo Achillis, by flexing the leg and extending the foot, are aU that can be done. Union probably occiu’s by bone in some cases, though very commonly by fibrous tissue. The Astragalus alone is rarely broken. Ten recorded cases of this injmy have been collected by Monahan : in nine of these the fractiu’e occurred from falls from a height on the foot; in one only from direct violence. I have seen two cases of fr'actme of the astragalus without implication of any other of the tai’sal bones. In one case it was the result of direct violence ; a cart-wheel passing over the foot occasioned a fractiu'e of the astragalus through its neck. There was no material displacement, but the line of fr’actiu’e could be readily felt, and crepitus was very distinctly eheited on flexing and extending the foot. No better treatment can be adopted in such a case than the starched or plaster bandage. In the other case the fractm’e was the result of indirect violence, the patient, a man about 30 years of age, falling from a height of about eight yards, and alighting on his feet. Here the fractm-e was evidently occasioned by the foot being forcibly di-iven up into the maUeolar arch, so that the astragalus was broken across transversely just in front of the surface that articulates with the tibia—the hue of fracture rumiing ob- liquely downwards and backwards, so that the whole of the upper and posterior part of the bone was detached. This large fragment was widely displaced, being drawm outwards and backwards, so as to lie between the fibula and the tendo Achillis, lacerating the skin to the extent of about one inch longitudinally, and pro- jecting through the opening thus made. The foot presented a singular degree of deformity, which is rcjn-csented in the an- nexed figm-e (Fig. 203). The outer mal- leolus projected gi-eatly; and immediately behind this the displaced fragment could be felt and seen partially pro- truding through the rent in the skin. The inner malleolus Avas depressed ;4S6 SPECIAL FRACTURES. there was a deep hollow below this. The os calcis was apparently turned somewhat towards the inner side of the foot. Tlic solo was arched, the skin much An-inkled, and the great toe forcibly flexed. There was a deep transverse furrow in front of the ankle-joint. On discovering the nature of the accident, and seeing the hopelessness of reduction, or rather the impossibi- lity of maintaining the displaced frag-ment in position, I cut down upon it by enlarging the opening through which it showed itself, and then, seizing it with strong bone-forceps, twisted it out, dividing tlie ligamentous connexions. The case was then treated as one of compound dislocation of the ankle-joint. About a month after the accident, the patient died of pyaemia ; and, on exa- mining the foot, it was found that the anterior portion of the astragalus had been splintered into seven fragments, which were retained in place by the pressiu’e of the siUTOunding parts. No other bone of the tarsus was injured, nor was the malleolar arch fractured. Of this splintering of the anterior frag- ment, there was no evidence diming hfe ; nor was there any reason to suspect it, as there was neither crepitus nor displacement. The extent of the fr’actme showed the immense force with which the astragalus had been driven into and against the malleolar arch. Were such a case again to occur to me, I should certainly amputate at once. The only similar case with which 1 am acquainted is one recorded by Mon-is. In this the displaced frag-ment did not occasion a woimd of the integument. It was excised owing to the impossibility of reducing it; but the anterior part of the astragalus which ivas left fell into a state ol caries, which spread to the other tarsal bones, rendering amputation of the foot necessary. The other tarsal bones are but I'ery rarely fractured, except in crushes or gun-shot injuries of the foot. The Scaphoid I have once seen fractiu-ed by a fall. It Avas in the case of a man who fell down the shaft of a lift at an hotel, about 00 feet deep, receiving injiuies to the chest and spine that eventually killed him. He appeared to have alighted, in the fii’st instance, on the right foot, the os calcis of which was extensiA'ely fractm-ed, and the scaphoid broken across Aidthout displacement, the astragalus being uninjiued. In all cases of fracture of the tarsal bones, whether simple or compomid, with so much displacement as to render reduction difficult and its maintenance impossible, the best coiuse to be pursued is that of cutting doAim upon and remoAung the displaced fragment. I know not Avhat else can be done.^ Fracture of the Metatarsal Bones usually occiu’S from du’ect Avolence, as by the passage of the wheel of a cart or railway-camage over the foot, and is then attended Avith so much laceration and bruising of the soft parts as not unfrcquently to render amputation necessary. I have in one instance knoAvn the three outer metatarsal bones broken by a person jimipiug fr-om a height. But most commonly their elasticity saves them, and the ankle-joint gives Avay in such an accident. There is but little, if any, displacement m these cases ; and unless the soft parts be so damaged as to require amputation, the support of a starched or plaster bandage is usually all the treatment that is necessary.457 CAUSES OF DISLOCATION. CHAPTER XXII. DISLOCATIONS. By a Dislocation is meant the more or less sudden and complete displacement of one of the bony structures of a joint from the other. In the orbicular joints, as the hip and shoidder, the osseous stmctiu'es may be completely separated from one another, the dislocation then being Complete. In the hinge-joints, as the elbow and knee, the osseous surfaces commonly remain partially in contact, though displaced from their normal relations to one another : here the disloca- tion is Incomplete. In most dislocations the integuments covering the dis- placed bones are put greatly on the stretch ; but in some they are ruptimed, and then the dislocation is Compound. Besides these varieties, Siu’geons recog- nise Spontaneous dislocation, in which the displacement does not occur from external violence. In other cases again, the dislocation arises from Congenital malformation of the joint, in consequence of which the bones cannot remain in proper apposition ; and finally, dislocation may take place slowly and gra- dually as a result of disease in the articulation and siuTonnding tissues. This is termed pathological dislocation. It is customary nowadays to describe dislocations of the distal bone or the more movable bone ; formerly, dislocation of the proximal bone was often spoken of. Cal'ses.—Dislocation is Predisposed to by various conditions, amongst which the natine of the joint appears to exercise most influence ; orbicular joints being more liable to dislocation than any of the other articulations, whilst in some of the synchondroses it never occurs. Malgaigne finds that, of 401 cases of dislocation, 321 occiuTed in the shoulder, 34 in the hip, 33 in the clavicle, 26 in the elbow, 20 in the foot, besides others in the thumb, vnist, and jaw. Dislocations are seldom met with in children, in whom fractures thi’ough the line of junction between the epiphysis and shaft more readily occin. I have, however, had under my care a child, just one year old, with dislocation of the head of the femin on the os pubis, occasioned by another older cliild dragging it along the ground by its leg ; Kirby and Madge have both seen dislocations of the femur on the dorsum ihi in children of three and three and a half years old ; and Travers has seen the hip dislocated in a boy five years of age. In old people the bones are so brittle, and the ligaments so tough, that violence causes fractiu’e rather than dislocation. Hence it is principally in young and middle-aged subjects that dislocations are met Avith. This is Avell illustrated by an analysis of 84 cases of dislocation of the hip-joint, collected by Hamil- ton : of these, 15 occuiTed under 15 years of ago, 32 betAA'een 15 and 30, 29dislocations. 45S between 80 and 4r>, and « between 4o and 85. They are necessarily far more common in nmn than in women, from the natime of their respective occnpatioiis. Ihus, according to Hamilton, of 115 dislocations of the hip, only 11 occuiTcd m women. I m articular ends of the bones of the extremities arc kept in their proper iwsitions by the arrangement of the osseous and ligamentous structures of the joints, aided by the continuous tension of the muscles. Considerable external violence may thus be applied to a limb Avithout dislocating it. If, hoAvever, the muscles be taken by siu-prise, or if they have been Aveakened by previous injiuy of any kind, the joint becomes predisposed to dislocation, and may be displaced imder the influence of A^ery slight causes; especially if it be one Avhere the articulating smface is shallow and the ligaments are comparatively Aveak. In this Avay the same joint may be repeatedly dislocated. Thus I have seen a man whose humerus had been dislocated between forty and fifty times, OAAflug to a Aveakened state of the deltoid. The Direct Causes of Dislocation are external violence and muscular action. External violence may act directly upon a joint, forcing or twisting tbe articular ends asunder, as happens Avhen the foot is displaced by a twist of the ankle, or when the thumb is dislocated backwards by a blow. But more commonly the force acts at a distance from the joint that is displaced, and the head of the bone is thi’OAvn out of its socket by “ the lever-like moA’ement of the shaft,” as happens when the head of the humerus is dislocated by a fall on the hand, or when the head of the femm* is dislocated. Muscular action alone may cause the dislocation of a bone, CA'en though the part be previously in a somid state. Thus, the loAver jaAv has been dislocated by excessiA'c gaping, and the humerus by making a violent muscular effort. If the joint have already been AA'eakened bypreAdous injmy or disease, muscular action is especially apt to occasion its displacement. Congenital dislocations, in aU probabihty, arise fr'om irregular muscular contractions in the foetus, by which the bones are displaced, and the normal development of the joint is interfered AAuth. In dislocations of the orbicular joints, after the head of the bone has been thi'OAAm out of its articular caA’ity, it is often stiU fm-ther dis- jDlaced by the contraction of the muscles, AA'^hich continues until they have shortened themselves to their frfll extent, or imtil the dislocated bone comes into contact with some osseous prominence that prevents its fm’ther displacement. Signs.—The existence of a dislocation is rendered evident by the change in the shape of the jomt, and in the relation of the osseous prominences to one another : by the articular end of the displaced bone being felt in a iibaa' position ; and by an alteration in the length of the limb, and in the direction of its axis. Besides this, there are after a time, if not immediately on the occiuTence of the accident, impaired motion, both acth'e and passfr’e, of the injured articulation, and pain in and around it. It should, hoAvever, be borne in mind that fractime may exist with the dislocation ; hence the mobility may be increased. Effects.—The effects of dislocation on the structm’e of a joint are ahvays serious. The bones are not uufrequently fr’actimed as aa'cII as displaced, more jiarticularly in hinge-joints : the cartilages may be injured ; and the ligaments are ahvays much stretched and more or less torn, the capsule ot the joint suffer-effects oh unreduced DISLOCATIOX. 459 in<r especiaUy. This is always torn by the prcssiu-e of the liead of the bone in dislocation of orbicidar joints : in those of liinge-joints, it may escape, ihe situation of the slit in the capsule is of great importance in reference to rcauc- tion. It commonly occurs in the shoulder towards the attachment around tlic o-lenoid cavity ; in the hip, as Busch has pointed out, at the acetabular margin. In many cases, the muscles and tendons in the immediate neighbourhood are lacerated as well as displaced, and the vessels and nerves compressed. The skin is commonly stretched, and sometimes ruptimed, when the dislocation becomes compound. If the dislocation be simple, and if reduction be speedily effected, the injuries ai'c soon repaired ; and although a good deal of stiffiiess may continue, the fimctions of the joint are, in general, not pemianently interfered with. If the dislocation be left urn-educed, important changes take place mthiii and around the joint, in the bony structures, the ligaments, capsule, and muscles. The changes in the bony structm-es are very slow, differing in this respect materially in ordinary traumatic dislocations, from what takes place in a joint that has been dislocated as the result of disease. If the articulation 1 be an orbicular one, as the shoulder or hip, the cavity, whether glenoid or acetabular, undergoes very gradual changes in outline and depth; its circum- ference becomes contracted, less regular, more angular, and the hollow even- tually shallows. These changes are so slow in the adult, that several years will elapse before they have gone on to such a degxee as to prevent the dis- placed head of the bone fr-om bemg put back. In children and yoimg people they are more rapid and complete, and the cavity fills up with a dense fibrous deposit. In the hinge-joints, the articular ends of the displaced bones become altered in shape—flattened or angular, -with the osseous projections less strongly marked. The incrusting cartilage is gradually absorbed, and the bone smoothed. The ligaments are shortened and wasted ; and a false joint forms around the articular end of the bone in its new situation. In some cases, the bone upon which the dislocated head rests becomes depressed into a shallow cup-shaped cavity, so as to receive it; in others the depression is formed by the elevation of a rim of callus upon the adjacent bone ; and in both instances the areolar tissue in the neighboiuhood becomes consolidated into a fibroid cai^sule sur- rounding and fixing the bone in its new situation, and usually admitting of but a limited degTee of motion. The soft structures that have been lacerated at the time of the dislocation become matted together by plastic material ; the muscles shorten, atrophy, and at last imdergo fatty degeneration fr-om disuse : the neighbouring- vessels and nerves may become attached to the new joint, or their sheaths become incorporated with the altered structiu-es in contact w'ith them. Tkeatmext.—In the treatment of dislocations, the first and principal indi- cation consists in replacing the bone in its normal situation as speedily as possible. In doing this, the 8ui-geon has two great difficulties to overcome : 1, the contraction of the muscles of the part ; and 2, the resistance arising from the anatomical stracturc of the joint and the laceration of the capside. f. One great obstacle to reduction in most dislocations is the tonic rou- fruction of the muscles inserted into or below the displaced bones ; and in tlic reduction of the dislocation the Surgeon’s efforts arc chiefly directed to over-460 DISLOCATIONS. come this contraction. The amount of resistance due to muscular contraction may be measured by the efforts produced by antesthetising the patient. So much of the resistance as is overcome by putting the patient under the in- fluence of ether or chloroform, is due to muscular contraction. All that which continues after this, is due to purely mechanical causes connected with the arrangement of the osseous and ligamentous structures of the joint, or with the injury inflicted on them. The resistance offered by the muscles is of several ditterent kinds, and is dependent on different causes. The influence exercised by the patient’s will, and the tonic contraction or passive force exerted by the shortened and displaced muscles, undoubtedly often offer great obstacles to reduction. But more serious than these by far is the reflex or spasmodic action, w'hich the patient is unable to control, and Avhich can only be overcome by force, by faintness, or by the paralysing influence of aneesthetics. The longer the dislocation is left unreduced, the more powerful does the resisting force become ; being less at the moment of the accident and immediately after- wards, than at any subsequent period. Hence reduction should be attempted as soon as possible after the occurrence of the accident; and, if the patient be seen at once, the bone may sometimes be replaced without much difficulty by the unaided efforts of the Singeon. Thus Liston reduced a dislocated hip by his own endeavoiu’s immediately after the accident occm'red. If a few hours have elapsed, the muscular tension becomes so great that special measmes must be adopted in order to diminish it; and if some weeks or months have been allowed to pass by, the dislocation may have become iireducible, partly owing to permanent secondary contraction of the muscles which have been shortened, wLich it is impossible to overcome, but chiefly to the matting together of the stuTounding tissues, and the formation of adhesions about the head of the bone. The muscular resistance is greatest when an attempt is made at reduction by forcible traction in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the limb, and parallel to the coiu’se of the muscles. In the reduction of a recent dislocation, advantage may sometimes be taken of the occurrence of faintness, or of the patient’s attention being distracted to other matters, the muscles being then taken, as it Avere, by sinprise, and. the bone readily slipping into its place. Such aids as these, hoAveAnr, caimot be depended upon ; and muscular relaxation should be induced by the administra- tion of cliloroform or ether. By the employment of these valuable agents, the muscles of the strongest man may be rendered so perfectly flaccid and poAverless in a few minutes as to offer no opposition whatever to reduction, AA'^hich is thus AA'onderfuUy simplified and facihtated. In no department, indeed, of practical siu’gery has the administration of anesthetic agents been attended by more advantageous results than in this. Mechanical contrivances are much less frequently used for the reduction of dislocation, since the employment of anesthetics, than formerly. It is, how- ever, occasionally necessary to employ apparatus calculated to flx the articidar surface from which the bone is dislocated, and to di-aw doAim or disentangle the displaced bone to such an extent that it may be replaced on the sm-face from which it has escaped. If the patient have not been anaesthetised, it will be fomid that, Avhen the bone is well brought doAim by the extending force so as to be opposite its articulation, and disentangled from osseous points upon which461 reduction of dislocations. it may have hitched, or from the cd-c of the slit in the lacerated capsule, it ^vill be drawn at once into its proper position by the action of its own muscles, with a sudden and distinct snap ; the muscles of the part being the most efficient agents in the reduction, so soon as the bone is placed in a position Inr them to act upon it. AVhen, however, the patient has been placed under the influence of chloroform, the muscular system being thoroughly relaxed, the bone n-ill not slip into its place with a snap or sudden jerk, but is reduced more quietly, and rather by the efforts of the Surgeon than by any sudden contraction of its own muscles. It is important to note these differences in the mode of reduction ; lest the Surgeon, when chloroform has been fully adminisfceied, failing to hear the snap or feel the jerk wliich he expected, imagining that the bone lias not been reduced, should continue to use an improper degree of extension. Manipulation of the hmb—that is, impressing upon it certain movements of extension and flexion, of adduction and of abduction—is often of essential seri'ice in effecting reductions. It is useful in those cases, particulaily, where the obstacle to replacement of the head of the bone is due less to muscular con- traction tlian to the locking together of osseous surfaces, or the impediment offered by the displacement of the ligaments of the part. In the hip, elbow, and knee it has been especially serviceable,- and has now taken the place of many of the more formal methods of reduction by extension in the axis of the limb, with the view of overcoming forcible resistance offered by muscular con- tractions or capsular entanglement. The purely mechanical means for the reduction of dislocation are sufficiently simple : the patient’s body, and the articular cavity into which the luxated bone is to be replaced, are fixhd by a split sheet, a jack-towel, a padded belt, or some such contrivance, by which counter-extension is practised. In some cases the hands of an assistant, or of the Surgeon himself, or the pressiue of his knee or heel, constitute the best counter-extending means. Extension may be made either by the Sm’geon grasping the limb to be reduced and drawing it do-wnwards, or else by means of a bandage or jack- towel fixed upon the part, with the clove-hitch knot applied in the way represented in the an- nexed cut (Fig. 204). If more force be required, the multiplying pulleys (Fig. 229), or Bloxam’s dislocation tourniquet (Fig. 233), may be used, by which any amount of extending force that may be required can readily be set up and maintained. Jarvis’s “ adjuster ” is an useful and powerful iu- stinment for the same purpose. These contri- vances, however, arc much less frequently required now than formerly, owing to Surgeons taking advan- _ , . „ Fig. 204.—Bamlage .apiilieil for cage of the paralysing effects of chlorof 01m Extension: Clove-luteU Knot. upon the muscular system, aud consequently not requiring so much force to overcome its contraction, and employing the462 DISLOCATIONS. gentler method of manipulation, by which resistance is eluded by attention to ordinary mechanical principles, rather tlian overcome by force. When any powerful exteuding force is applied, the skiu of the part should alu-ays bo pro- tected fiom being chafed by a few turns of a wet roller. The extension must be made slowly and gradually without any jerking, so as to secure equality of motion as well as of traction. In this way the contraction of the muscles is gradually overcome, Avhereas sudden and forcible extension might excite them to reaction. The traction is most advantageously made in the newly acquired axis of the limb, without reference to its normal direction or to the situation of the joint. The head of the bone is thus made to pass along the same track w'hich it has torn for itself in being dislocated, and thus is replaced without the infliction of any additional violence on the sinrounding tissues. The question whether the extending force should be applied to the bone that is actually displaced, or to the fiu-ther end of the limb, has been much discussed, and appears to have received more attention than it deserves. It is true that, by applying the extending force to the displaced bone itself, the Surgeon has greater command over its movements, with less chance of injury to the inter- ■^•cning bones ; whilst, by applying the extending force to the lower part of the extremity, he has the advantage of a longer lever for the reduction of the head of the bone. This lever, however, it must be remembered, is in many cases a broken one ; and it caimot be made to act if the bone have to be replaced in the direction of the flexion of the joints that exist in its course. For this reason, we And that some dislocations are best reduced by applying traction to the bone itself that is displaced, as in luxations of the femim and of the bones of the fore-arm ; whilst, in other cases, as in the dislocations of the humerus, most advantage is gained by applying the extending force to the end of the limb. But I look upon these points as of comparatively little consequence ; believing that, Avhen the patient is not anassthetised, the muscles of the limb themselves effect the reduction, -without the necessity of the Surgeon employing any very powerful lever-Hke action of the bone ; and that, when the patient is paralysed by chloroform, the bone is in most cases readily replaced by the simple movements impressed directly upon it, or even upon its articular end, by the hands of the Surgeon. The force required in effecting the reduction of recent dislocations is often very considerable. So great is the resistance offered, that in some cases the dislocated bone has given way under the traction. I am acquainted with cases in which the humerus and the neck of the femin’ have both been broken in effecting the reduction of recent dislocations. This accident does not always appear to have been the result of any improper or unskilful employment of force but in some cases to have ocem-red from natm-al weakness of bone. We know that “spontaneous” fractures fi-equently take place from musculai’ action, often of a very slight kind: and we can easily understand that, if a bone that woifld be liable to such ready fracture happened to be dislocated, it would almost of necessity give way under the influence of the extending or lever-like force required to replace it. 2. The reduction of dislocations is also impeded by the mechanical resistance arising fi-om the anatomical structure of the joint and its ligaments. In reducing a dislocation, it is of especial importance to attend to the relation of the463 DISLOCATIOXS OF OLD STANDIFO. osseous points in the nci<>-hbourhood of the joint, and to disentangle the displaced bone from any of these upon which it may be lodged. ^ especially the case in such hinge-joints as the jaw and elbow, in which the aiTangement of the articulation is somewhat complicated ; and in some orbi- cnlarloints, as the hip, Avhere the reduction is prevented liy the displacement and tension of torn ligamentary structures. When the patient is anoDsthe- tised, and aU muscular resistance has thus been removed, any remaining diffi- culty in eft'ecting reduction must be due to purely mechanical causes dependent on the disaiTangement of the bones and ligaments. Under the older methods of treatment, where much force was employed by pulleys or other similai contrivances, these were often torn thi’ough. But, since the introduction of mampidation, the Surgeon effects the reduction by a far less degxee of force, replacing the bone on simple mechanical pi’inciples, by relaxing the ligaments and disentangling the bones from one another. The situation and extent of the laceration of the capsule of the joint are also of great importance as offering* an obstacle to reduction, in some cases constricting the neck of the bone, in othei*s having one hp of the slit pressing against the bone in such a way as to I resist all efforts to move it. An extreme degree of force is required to tear through and thus overcome obstructions of this kind ; but they may readily be relaxed and slipped aside by skilful manipulation and attention to the position of the limb. After the dislocation has been reduced, the bone must be retained in posi- tion by proper sphnts and bandages ; the joint being kept quiet for two or three weeks, according to its size, so as to allow proper union to take place in the capsule and neighbouring structur as. Any consecutive inflammation may often be prevented by the continuous application of cold ; and, if set up, must be treated by local antiphlogistic measures. After reduction, the limb must be kept flrmly fixed and at rest for rivo or three weeks, so as to allow the lacerated ligaments and capsule to recover themselves. But fixation of the joint must not be maintained for too long a time, lest adhesions, often of a painfid character, form. These may be avoided by passive motion. If they have formed, they may readily be broken doAra by the manipulations commonly employed in such cases by “bone-setters,” who, flxing the joint by pressure of the thumb on the painful spot, in a mamier well described by W. Hood, impart sudden and forcible movement to the hmb, by which adventitious bands are ruptiu’ed. Dislocations of Old Standing.—If a dislocation have been left unre- duced for some weeks or months, changes, which have already been described, take place in and around the displaced articular structmes, the double effect of which is to render the replacement of the bones in their normal position more and more difficult as time goes on, and to lead to the formation of a new j though imperfect articulation at the seat of the displaced bone. I When a dislocation has been left permanently unreduced for a considerable Ij length of time, as for years, the amount of utility in the limb will depend I partly on the kind of joint that has been dislocated, partly on the particular i variety of dislocation that has occiUTcd. Thus, as a general rule, greater free- I dom of movement and greater utility of limb will be found in old-standing ' dislocations of ball-and-socket than of hinge-joints. But in ball-and-sockel;464 DISLOG ATION,'^. joints some dislocations will, if left nm-cduccd, be attended with less e^■il consequences to the patient than others. Thus, in the mhjlenoid dislocation of the shoulder and'the sdaUc of the hip, the limb will reeover itself to a greater extent than in the other fonns of the same kind of iiiiury aflectino- these joints. ° Treatment.—hx cases of very old and inemediable unreduced dislocation, much may be done by means of regularly conducted passi^•e movements to increase the mobility of the part, and by means of friction and warm douches to relieve the tension and painful stiffness. In cases not so old, but in which some time has elapsed since the occurrence of the dislocation, two questions always present themseh'es to the Siu-geon :—1. Is it possible to replace the dislocated bone ? 2. Is it desirable or prudent to attempt reduction ? The possibility of reducing the dislocation uill depend partly upon the joint that is dislocated and the nature and extent of the dislocation, but chiefly on the length of time dining wliich the bone has been out of place. Disloca- tions of the orbicular joints generally can be reduced at a much later period than those of the ginglymoid ; those of the shoulder can be reduced after a longer lapse of time than those of the hip. The subglenoid dislocation of the shoulder and that of the hip on the dorsum ilii are capable of reduction at a later period than the other luxations of the same joints. The latest period at which reduction is possible has been variously estimated by different Singeons. Sir A. Cooper gives three months for the shoulder and eight weeks for the hip. As a general statement, this was no doubt tolerably correct at the time when it was made, although reduction had been effected at later periods than those given by Cooper. Thus Breschet reduced a dislocation of the hip at the 78 th day, and Travers at the fifth month. But we may now go far beyond this as the limit of possible reduction. Brodhiu'st has reduced the shoulder on the 175th day ; Smith (U.S.) in one case at the seventh month, in another at ten months and a half; Blackman of Cincinnati, a dislocation of the femur on the dorsum ilii at six months ; Dupiems of the Havana, one at over six mouths, in a boy, and this without chloroform ; and E. W. Smith, after nine months had elapsed. The Obstacles to the Reduction of old-standing dislocations are rather pathological, than physiological and anatomical as in the case of recent displace- ments. They are of several distinct kinds :—1. The powerful tonic contraction of the shortened and displaced muscles ; 2. The organic changes that have taken place in these muscles, aiisiug partly from their contraction of the tissue thrown out to repair the laceration, partly firom a kind of rigid atrophy, the consequence of inflammatory action and of disease ; 3. Adhesions that form between the lacerated capsule and the muscles and the displaced head of the bone ; 4. Lastly, as a more remote effect, pathological changes in the articu- lating- surfaces themselves, by which their shape becomes altered and the socket shallowed, contracted, and perhaps ultimately obliterated by fibroid deposits. overcome these obstacles a consideiable amount of foice must b^ used, as adhesions and contractions have to be stretched and toin asundci. This is effected by the multiplying pulleys and by mauipulation undci chloro- form. In employing the necessary force, care must be taken to piotect tlic.OLD UNREDUCED DISLOCATIONS. 4^5 skin from abrasion, or even laceration, by the use of wet flannel bandages oi Avasli-lcatbcr. Tlic force exercised l)y the pulleys must be considcralfle; but it should be accompanied by free rotatory manipulations and moyements ot the head of the bone, so as to loosen it from its adhesions and reduction will usually be effected in this way rather than by forcible traction only. Anesthesia is of inestimable service in these cases ; and it is by its means that the Surgeon has been enabled to prolong materially the limit of possible reduction. But, in the reduction of old dislocation.^ anesthetics do not afford exactly the same kind of service as in those of recent date. In a recent dislocation the chief obstacle is muscular contraction ; and, by relaxiuo- this, anesthetics enable the Siu’geon to replace the bone at once without difficulty. In old dislocations the obstacles, as has just been stated, consist ill various pathological changes that have taken place aroimd and in the displaced bones. These conditions cannot be influenced by anesthesia ; and hence, except as a means of producing insensibility to pain^ and pre- A-enting instmetive or A'oluntary muscular resistance, chloroform udll not aid the Surgeon. _ • ■ . i • It must be borne in mind that the reduction of old dislocations is not only a work of very considerable difficulty, but also of considerable danger. If seA eral mouths have elapsed, the obstacles arising from the pathological changes aheady mentioned will usually be so obstinate as to render the reduction impossible without the employment of a dangerous amount of force, and in many cases they i\ill prevent the possibility of reduction, whatever force be employed. The Accidents liable to occur diu’ing attempts to reduce old dislocations, whether successful or not, are the following:—1. Laceration of the skin by the constriction aaid pressme of the bands to which the pulleys are attached. 2. Laceration of muscles : thus the pectoral has been torn through in attempting reduction of old dislocation of the shoulder. 3. The development of inflam- mation and suppiu’ation around the dislocation, by the violence to which the soft parts haA'e been subjected. From this cause death has seA'eral times resulted, in attempts at reducing old hip-dislocations. 4. Extensive extraA'asa- tion of blood from the ruptiu’e of small vessels in the lacerated soft parts, giving rise to vide-spread ecchymosis. 5. Laceration of one of the larger veins. A patient of Froriep’s died fi-om this cause, after rupture of the axil- laiy vein, in an attempt to reduce an old dislocation of the shoulder. G. Laceration of an artery, and the formation of a diffused traumatic anemism. This serious accident has happened at least twelve times in attempted reduction •of old dislocations of the shoulder. The brachial artery has also been torn in attempted reduction of dislocated elbow. 7. Laceration of neighbouring nerves. Those of the axillary plexus have been torn in attempted reduction of dislocation of the shoulder, and the median in that of the elbow. 8. Fracture of the dislocated bone. This serious accident has usually happened Avheir the Surgeon, after the employment of extension, has attempted to put in force transverse movements of the bone, or has used the bone as a lever ; Avhen it has given Avay, usually high up near the head, at other times in the shaft. It is possible that in some cases this may have been predisposed to by the bone haA'ing become Aveakened by want of use.

Neighbourino- bones have been fractured, simh as the ribs and the glenoid cavity in the endeavour to reduce dislocation acetabuhun in attempted reduction of a luxated hip. 10. The hmb has actually been torn off. This remarkable and distressiiio- accident happened to Guerin of Paris, in attempting the reduction withoirt pulleys, and mcrety by the traction of assistants, of a dislocation of the shoulder of three months’ standing, in a Avoman G8 years of age, the limb being sud- denly torn off at the elboAAV On examination, the bones Avere found porous, the muscular and other soft structm-es pulpy, the limb haniig thus evidently lost its natural strength and elasticity. The occuiTence of these various accidents and injuries, in the attempted reduction of old dislocations, cannot ahvays be justly attributed to the employ- ment of an improper degree of force by the Sm-geon. The liability to them must rather be looked upon as a necessary and ineAutable accompaniment of all attempts at putting back into its jilace a bone AAdiich has been dislocated, and left unreduced for many Aveeks or several months. During this period the bone usually contracts adhesions of a A'ory dense kind to the parts amongst Avhich it lies ; and, as it cannot be replaced in its articular caAity until these adhesions have been torn or broken through, it is easy to understand hoAV, in the attempt to do this, neighbouring soft parts, A'essels, or neiTes may give Avay, or the bone itself may yield to'the force that must be apiflied to it in order to lift it-out of its iieAV bed. The liabihty to the occurrence of these accidents should make the Surgeon very cautious hoAV he reconunends the attempt at the reduction of old-stauding- dislocations. If after a time the neA\^ joint haA’e become tolerably mobile, and be not painful, it may be better to leaA'e the bone unreduced, rather than expose the patient to great risk, Avith a slender prospect of CA'entual success. If the unreduced dislocation be stiff and painful, much may be done by passiA'e motion, frictions, and douches, to improve the patient’s condition. The Subcutaneous Section of muscles, tendons, and bands of adhesions in the neighborahood of the dislocated joint, has been proposed by Dieffenbach as a means of facilitating reduction in old-standing cases ; and he relates an instance in Avhich, by these means, a shoulder that had been dislocated for tvo years Avas reduced. In many cases in Avhich this plan has been tried, the success has not been commensurate AA'ith the expectations raised respecting it; and in other instances, of AA'hich I haA’e seen tAvo or three, the operation has been folloAved by sloughing and other serious CA’ils, AA'hile it has not been attended by any benefit in facihtating reduction. CoMPOiiN'D Dislocation is one of the most serious injmles to AA’hich a limb can be subjected. Not only is there such extensfr’e laceration of the soft parts that coA’er and enter into the formation of the joint as to giA’C rise to the most severe forms of traimiatic arthritis, but the bones are often fractured, and the main A’essels of the limb perhaps greatly stretched or torn. The Treatment of a compound dislocation must be conducted on theCOMPLICATED BISLOCATIONS. 4^7 same principles that i^nide the Surgeon in the management of a wounded ioint, \-iz., cold, or antiseptics, Avith drainage to secure the free escape ot the inflammatory products. OAving to the ruptiu-e of the ligaments aud_ ot the muscular attachments, there is usually no difficulty in the reduction, the bones being readily replaced ; but the danger consists in the destruc- tive inflammatory action that Avill be set up in the joint and limb from the extensive injury inflicted upon them. This varies greatly, according to the size and situation of the joint, and the state of the soft parts. ^ If the joint be small, as one of the phalangeal articulations, the dislocation may be reduced, and the parts covered Avith cold lint. If it be one of the larger joints, the line of practice Avill vary according to other circmnstances than the mere dislocation. Thus, if it be in the upper extremity, the patient being healthy, and the soft parts not very extensively contused or torn, the bones may be replaced, cold irrigation assiduously applied, and antiphlogistic treatment pursued. If there be fr’acture conjoined Avith the dislocation, resection shoidd be practised, as Avas successfully done by Hey in several cases of injury of the elboAV of this description ; but if the soft parts be greatly injured as AA^eU, and especially if the blood-A^essels and nerves of the limb have suffered, amputation must be performed. In the loAver extremity, amputation is more fr’equently necessaiy ; in the knee, almost invariably so. Sir A. Cooper states that he knoAvs no accident that more imperatively demands amputation than compound dislocation of this joint. Yet there are exceptions to this rule ; thus. White had a case of compound dislocation of the knee- joint in a boy, nine years of age, at the Westminster Hospital, in Avhich he saved the limb by saAving off the condyles of the femur and reducing the bone. In the compound dislocations of the ankle and the astragalus, an attempt should generally be made to save the hmb, in the AA'ay that aauU be more specially pointed out Avhen Ave come to treat of these injuries. After recovery fr'om compound dislocation, the joint AviU often remain permanently stiffened; hence attention to position during the treatment is essentially required. In many cases, hoAvever, very good motion is ultimately obtained, though the stiffness may continue for some length of time. CoAiPLiCATloxs.—Fracture of the Shaft of one of the Long Bones with Dislocation of its Head increases considerably the difficulty of re- duction. In these circmnstances, it has been recommended to consolidate the fracture first, and then to attempt the reduction. But to do this is only to^ defer and increase the difficulties. At least seven or eight Aveeks must elapse before the fr-acturc AviU be sufficiently firmly united to bear the requisite trac- tion to reduce so old a dislocation ; and then there AviU be great chance of rupture of the callus, and there AviU certainly be extreme difficulty in the reduction. It therefore appears to me much safer, under all circumstances, to reduce the dislocation at once, and afterAvards to treat the fracture in the usual Avay. In reducing a dislocation complicated Avith fractiu’c of the shaft ot the displaced bone, the fracture must first be put up very firmly indeed, Avith Avooden splints completely encasing the limb. The patient must then be put fully under the influence of chloroform, Avhich is of the most essential sorA'ice in these cases ; and, Avhen the muscles are completely relaxed, extension and counter-extension being made in the usual Avay, the reduction may be H H 2468 DISLOCATIONS. effected. Ihc extending means should always be applied upon the splints, so that thcie may be no draggmg upon the Iracturc. In this way I have reduced, nithout any difficulty, a dislocation of the head of the humerus into the axilla, compheated with comminuted fractime of the shaft of the bone, in a remark- ably muscular man to whom I was called by Byam ; and about the same time I had undei my care at the Hospital a case of dislocated elbow, Avith fracture of the shaft of the humerus, that was reduced Avith ease in the same Avay. The difficulty in reduction is necessarily increased by the proximity of the fracture to the dislocated joint; and Avhen the epiphysis is broken off from the shaft and dislocated, the difficulty may be great, but is not insuperable. Some year's since, I assisted H. Smith and Dumi in the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus Avith fractm-e of the sm-gical neck of the bone, the displaced head lying to the inner side of the coracoid process. In this case the patient, a young man who had sustained the injin-y by a fall in an epileptic fit, Avas put under chloroform, and when he Avas fully anarsthetised the displaced head of the bone was easily replaced; the patient recovering with an excellent and useful arm. After the bone has been reduced, the fracture should be treated in the ordinary way. When a Simple Fracture extends into the Articular End of the Eone, as in some dislocations about the elbow and ankle, there is no material increase in the danger of the case or in the difficulty of its management. In Compound Dislocation "with Fracture of the Articular Ends, removal of splmters, and partial resection or amputation, will be required, according to the seat and extent of injiuy. Spontai^eous Dislocations may occur either suddenly or gradually, accord- ing to the nature of the cause that gives rise to them. Sjjontaneous dislocation, if that term can be properly applied to such cases, is often met Avith on the hip as the result of old disease. The ligamentous and cartilaginous structiu'es having become destroyed, the head of the bone atrophied and absorbed, the articular sm-faces become readily displaced imder the influence of slight muscular action. There is, however, a second and more rare form of spontaneous dislocation to which the hip and shoulder are liable, and which has been especially studied by Stanley. In this dislocation the head of the bone slips out of the arti- culation AAuthout any very marked sign of disease about the joint, and ceitainly Avithout any previous destruction of it. In these cases there is either a paralytic condition of the capsular muscles, as has been observed several times in the shoulder, the deltoid having become paralysed and thus having allowed the bone to shp out of place ; or, as has been noticed in the hip, olscure rheumatic or neuralgic pains have for some time been seated in the joint. The dislocation may not be confined to one joint, but may affect several. Thus, some time ago there was a case in University College Hospital, in which both shouldeis and hips were dislocated simultaneously. In many cases it occurs suddenly, and often without any pain, the deformity of the limb attracting attention ; though in others it has been preceded by rheumatic affection of the joint. _ There is a third vai'iety of spontaneous dislocation, in aaInch, the joint havung been dislocated and reduced, the muscular and ligamentous structures have become so weakened that ever afterwards it slips out of place on t e app ica-469 CONGENITAL DISLOCATIONS. tion of slight force, or at will on the patient throwing the muscles of the limb Thf of those cases is not very satishictory. lleduction in many cannot be accomplished ; while in others it maybe effected readily enough, but the bone cannot be fixed in the joint out of which it slips again. In a case m Bpontaneous dislocation of the hip, without any apparent disease of the joint, occiiiTing in a young woman, I readily effected reduction by the pulleys, three weeks after the occiuTcnce of the displacement. The limb was then fixec with the long splint, and maintained at a proper length for two or three weeks ; when in consequence of a sevei'e bronchitic attack, it became necessary to romoTo the appaivatus, and the displacement speedily returned. Whilst conyalescent from this attack, the patient feU and fractured the displaced femur in its upper third, thus rendering it impossible to replace^ the bone. In another case of spontaneous dislocation of the knee, occurring in the same painless maimer, the joint could not be replaced, and permanent deformity was loft. After reduction in similar cases, a splint or a starched bandage should be Avorn for a considerable length of time, so as to give a chance for the hgaments I of the joint to recover themselves. If there be a rheumatic tendency, it should be romoA'ed by suitable treatment; and if there be a paralytic condition of the muscles, electricity, the endermic application or hypodermic injection of stiychiiine, and cold douches vuth friction, may be advantageously employed. CoxGEXiTAL Dislocations are occasionally met with in the hip, shoulder, vi’ist, and jaw, and have of late years attracted the attention of Surgeons through the laboms of Gu6rin, Smith, Ohelius, Eobert, and others. These dislocations are closely allied in cause and nature Avith other congenital deformities of the limbs, such as club-foot, &c. In them there is usually found aiTested or imperfect development of some portions of the osseous articular ap- paratus. Whether this is original, thus causing the displacement of the bones, or consecutive upon disuse, occasioned by spasmodic action of one set of muscles or by paralysis of another, dependent on some inltation in the nervous centres, is scarcely Avorth inquiring here. In some cases it would aj>pear as if faulty position of the foetus in utero, or undue violence dining birth, may have occasioned the displacement. These dislocations are probably incurable, as there is alAA'ays congenital defect of structine in the articular ends of the bones, or of the socket into which they are received. There is a peculiar form of dislocation which I have once, and only once, : met Avith in a child, otherAvisc perfectly healthy, 12 years of age, and Avhich I had some resemblance to the congenital form. It Avas a dislocation of the head of the radius backwards, in consequence of Avant of development of the lower third of the ulna. In this case the radius Avas nearly two inches longer than the ulna. The want of development in the latter bone prevented the I proper growth of the forearm ; and the radius consequently, after having become slightly ciuwed, liecame sloAvly, but completely, dislocated at its humeral end. All the movements of the bone, hoAvever, Avere perfect.470 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. CHAPTEK XXIII. —I— SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. DISLOCATIONS OP THE LOWER JAW. Dislocations of the Lower Jaw are not common accidents. They occur more frequently in women than in men, and have been but very seldom met with at either extreme of life ; but Nelaton and Malgaigne relate cases occiUTing in edentulous subjects of 68 and 72 years of age, and Sir A. Cooper has seen the accident in a child, occasioned by another boy thrusting an apple mto its mouth. Those dislocations are most frequently occasioned by spasmodic action of the depressor muscles of the jaw—^by opening the mouth too widely, as in fits of laughing, of gaping, or in attempting to take too large a bite. Occa-. sionally this accident has resulted from blows or kicks upon the chin when the mouth is open, or from the violent strain upon the part in tooth-drawing, or rather in digging out stumps with an elevator. The mechanism of the dis- location is simple. When the mouth is opened, the interarticular fibro- cartfiage with the condyle glides forwards on to the articular eminence ; if this movement be continued too far, and the external pterygoid muscle contract forcibly at the same time, the condyle shps forward over the articular eminence into the zygomatic fossa, the axis of the ramus being directed obliquely back- wards, and the dislocation being thus complete. In this way both condyles may be displaced, or only one. Maisonneuve and Otto Weber, by producing dislocation on the dead body, have found that the condyle lies in front of the root of the zygoma. The coronoid process rarely reaches the malar bone, but usually lies below it, being comjiletely surrounded by the tendon of the temporal muscle. From original observation, C. Heath confiims this view of the position of the coronoid process. The interarticular fibro-cartilage is attached to the condyle, and follows its movements. The capsular ligament is stretched, but not ruptm-ed : the external lateral ligament is tense, and passes from behind forward instead of from before backward : the internal lateral and stylo- maxiUary figaments also undergo stretching, which is increased by raising the chin. The temporal muscles are stretched according to Maisonnem'e, or partly torn according to Weber. When the dislocation is Bilateral, as most frequently ha]Dpens, both condyles being displaced from the glenoid cavities, the signs are as follows. The incisor teeth of the lower jaw are separated from those of the iqiper by a marked interval, varying from half an inch to an inch and a halt; the mouth conse- quently cannot bo closed, but is kept more or less widely open. Deglutition and speech are impaired, the laliial consonants not being pronounced ; there is471 dislocations of the lower jaw. dribbliuo- of the saliva over the lower lip ; the chin is lengthened, and &e lo\m- line of teeth advanced about half an inch beyond those of the upper ]aw; tne cheeks are flattened, and there is a depression in front of the meatus auditoiius externus. There is also au oblong prominence in the temporal fossa between tne eye and the ear. If the dislocation be left unreduced, the patient slowly reo-ains some power of movement over the jaw ; he gi-adually approximates the lips, and, after a length of time, may even be enabled to bring the hues of teeth into apposition, especially posteriorly. In the Unilateral dislocation, ivliere one condyle only is displaced, the axis of the lower jaw is directed towards the opposite side to that on which the dis- placement exists ; and the general signs ai-e the same, but in a less mai-kcd dem-ce, as those which arc met noth when both sides are dislocated, ihe hoUow before the meatus on the injured side is, however, well marked, and serves to point out the seat and natm-e of the displacement, the diagnosis of Avhich is not ahvays readily made ; indeed, R. W. Smith states that he has seen attempts at reduction applied to the uninjiu-ed side. Sir A. Cooper has described a Subluxation of the jaw, most frequently met u'ith in yoiuig and delicate u^omen, in which, in consequence of the relaxation of the ligaments, the head of the bone appears to slip forwards upon the emiuentia articularis, vReiiever the mouth is opened at all mdely,^ as in gaping, laughing, &c. It may usually be ascertained by telling the patient to put out the tongue. The bone hitches, as it were, and prevents the mouth from being shut at once. Most commonly, the natiu’al efforts of the patient are sufficient to retinm the head of the bone into the glenoid cavity with a cracking noise or ca’Cii a loud snap. The Reduction of a dislocated jaAV is easily effected; it being only necessary to push the angle of the bone downwards and backwards, so as to disentangle the coronoid process from under the zygomatic arch, at the same time that the chin is raised by the Surgeon’s fingers, in order that the temporal and pterygoid muscles may draw the head of the bone into its proper position. The reduction is best effected by the Siu’geon standing before the patient and •applying his thumbs, well protected by a thick napkin, to. the molar teeth on each side, and thus depressing the angle of the jaw forcibly, at the same time that he raises the chin by means of his fingers spread out and placed underneath it. The bone is then returned into its place with so forcible a snap that the thumbs may be severely bitten unless care be taken, or they be well protected. 'When one condyle only is luxated, the efforts at reduction should be applied to the injm'Cd side only. After the reduction, the four-tailed bandage should be applied, as in cases of ftactiire of the jaw ; and for several days the patient must not be allowed to talk, or to eat any solid food, lest the displacement rctm-n, Avhich it always has a great tendency to do. Yeiy old dislocations of this bone may be reduced by the process just uoav described. Thus, Stromeyer replaced one at the end of thirty-five, Donovan one at the end of ninety-eight days, and Pollock one at the end of four months. In the cases of suhluxaiion, attention should be paid to the state of the general health. Tonics, more particularly iron, should be administered ; good diet, the cold bath, and open-air exercise enjoined. If, as frequently happens, there be some tenderness about the temporo-maxillary articulation, a series of472 SPECIAL niSLOCATIOiYS. small blisters may be applied over it.

Congenital dislocation or both condyles has not yet been observed. DISLOCATIONS OF THE UPPER LIMB. Dislocations of the Clavicle.—When we look at the flat character of the sterno-clavicular articulation and the very small and shallow surface in the acromion upon which the outer end of the clavicle is received, and reflect on the violence to^ which the shoulder is frequently subjected, we might at first imagine that dislocations of the clavicle would be amongst the most frequent forms of injmy in this region. But this is very far from being the case. They are, indeed, rarely met with in comparison to the frequency of fr’actures of this bone. This is owing to several causes : amongst these are the shortness and fii-mness of the ligaments by which the clavicle is attached to the sternum and aciomioii, and the fact that any force ajqilied to the bone is usually received in a line that con-esponds to its axis, thus causing it to be bent or broken rather than luxated. The mobility of the scapula, also, has a special tendency to jirevent dislocations of the outer end of the clavicle, the two bones easily moving together. Were it not for these circumstances, the bone would fr’equently be thrown off the small flat ai’ticular siu’face of the acromion. Dislocations of the clavicle can only be occasioned by v iolence applied to the shoulder in such a direction, as to drive the bone inwards towards the mesial line, at the same time that the sca2iula is fixed. Either the sternal or the acromial end of the clavicle may be dislocated, and the simultaneous displacement of both ends has been observed. 1. The Sternal End of the Clavicle may be luxated in a direction fonuarcls, laclziuards, or upwards, being throvii before, behind, or above the sternum. In the dislocation Forwards, the end of the bone can be felt in its new position, the point of the shoulder is ajDjiroximated to the mesial line, and the dejiressions above and below the clavicle are strongly defined. It is occasioned by blows upon the shoulder, by bending this part forcibly backwards, or by A’iolence applied to the elbow whilst the ann is raised from the side. In some cases it occurs spontaneously, as a secondary consequence of lateral ciu’vature or rotation of the upper dorsal vertebra;. This dislocation, which is amongst the most frequent to which the clavicle is subject, may readily be reduced by pushing the shoulder outwards and bending it backwards, while the elbow is brought in front of the mid-lateral473 DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. trachea, the sterno-mastoid muscle has an arched outline, and the axis of the hone is directed upwards, forwards, and inwards, so that the interval betAveen the clavicle and the fimt rib is very consider- able. The trachea and oesophagus ^ are compressed when the patient i sits up or leans forwards. Smith ^ fomid on dissection that the head of the bone lay above the ster- nmn, and rested on the sterno- hyoid muscle and trachea, the clavicnlai- ligament (Fig. 205). He observes that the reason of its rarity is that it can only be produced by force acting on the shoulder in a A'ery unusual direction, \iz., dowumnrds, inwards, and probably backwards. The Tmihmnt consists in placing a pad in the axilla, elevating the elbow", and bringing it well to the side. But I doubt if the bone, though replaced, can be maintained in a good position. The dislocation Backwards is not of common occurrence : though, accord- ing to Xelaton, there ai-e at least ten or a dozen cases on record. This luxation appears generally to haA'O resulted from the point of the shoulder being driven upwards, or from the hand being Auolently draAAui forwards. It has also been observed to result from the direct pressiu-e of the clavicle backAvards, as by the- kick of a horse. In one case under my care, the clavicle Avas dislocated back- Avards at its sternal end by the wheel of a cab passing across the bone, and thus dfrectly pressing it backwards, fracturing at the same time the second rib, and separating the first fr-om its cartilage, Avhich Avas attached to the clavicle by the uinaiptured costo-cla\'icular ligament, the traction on AA'hich by the dislocated clavicle had probably determined the separation of the cartilage from its rib. It has also occiUTcd as a sccondaiy consequence of ciu'vature of the spine. The Suins are those that usually attend a dislocation of the sternal end of the clavicle—shortening of the shoidder, and deformity about the upper part of the stenium ; but, besides these, a special train of symptoms is occasioned. ligaments of the joint being torn through, as was also the costo- O ' Fig. 205.—Position of Clavicle in Dislocation of Sternal] g End Upwards.

In the Treatment of this chslocation, it is easy to effect the reduction of the bone by making a fulcrum of the fist in the axiUa, and then bringing the elbow Avell to the side, at the same time that an assistant puts his knee between the patient’s shoulders and bends them backbut it is difficult to retain the bone in proper position. _ To fulfil this object, the figure-of-8 bandage tightly apphed to the points of the shoulders, and crossed oxer a large pad placed in the middle of the back, will give the most efficient support to the part, the elbow being at the same time well fixed to the side and di’awn back. 2. The dislocations of the Outer £ud of the Clavicle, or more correctly, the dislocations of the acromion from the claiicle, are more commonly met Avith than those just described. The most fr-equent accident of this description is that in AA'hich the bone is thi’OAATi upon the Upper Surface of the Acromion, or upon the Anterior Part of the Spine of the Scapula. In several cases of this accident which have presented themselves at Unfrersity an inch and a half, the facility of the reduction of the dislocation, and the prominence of the claviculai’ portion of the trapezius muscle, indicate the nature of the accideut (Fig. 206). The Treatment of this injiuy is by no means satisfactory. Eeduction may easily be effected by raising the shoidder, diuAAdng it backwards, and carrying it outAvards by placing a pad placement. This is partly oAAdng to the shalloAAmess of the articidar surface of the acromion, partly to the tension of the trapezius, by AAffiich the acromial end of the bone is draAvn upAvards and outAA^ards, and in a great degree to the mobility of the shoulder.

In every movement of the body or neck there will be found to be a tendency to rising upwards of the end of the dislocated bone, and in the majority ot cases this will be insurmountable by any mechanical means that can be employed. It is best limited, if not oliviated, by a pad and gutta-percha plate laid on the projeeting clavicle, and strapped tightly down by a band passing parallel to the arm and under the flexed fore-arm, this being retained in position by being attached to a strap passed round the opposite axilla. t the displacement continue to be irremediaiilc, a I'ery useful arm will still be left, only somewhat limited in its upward movements. The outer end of the clavicle has been dislocated under the Acromion by the application of direct violence to the end of the bone. This form of displace- ment is very rare ; several instances' have, however, been mentioned in the journals. The diagnosis is easy, simple digital examination pointing out the nature of the accident; and the treatment must be conducted in the same way as that of fractm-ed clavicle. The acromial end of the clavicle has been 'knoAvn to be displaced under- neath the Coracoid Process. Here, also, simple examination and the clavicular bandage suffice for diagnosis and treatment. The only instances of Simultaneous Dislocation of both ends of the Clavicle with which I am acquainted have been reported by Richerand and ^Jlorel LavaUee. Dislocation of the Scapula.—The Lower Angle and Dorsal Border of the scapula is occasionally the seat of a very remarkable kind of displacement, in consequence of which it projects at a considerable angle from the trunk, giving a winged appearance to the back. The cause of this peculiar displacement is obsciu'e : by some it is considered to be dependent upon the bone slipping away from under the posterior edge of the iatissimus dorsi muscle ; by others, and apparently with more reason, it is regarded as owmg to paralysis of the serratus magnus. Whether this be dependent upon some morbid condition of the muscle itself, as Jacob supposes, or on a paralysed state of the long thoracic nerve, as Xclaton thinks, can scarcely be determined. In such cases as these, I have seen some benefit derived from the endermic application of strychnine on a blistered surface, and afterwards support by means of a properly con- structed apparatus. Dislocations of the Shoulder-joint occur far more frequently than those of any other articulation. Their pathology and treatment have been so clearly elucidated by Sir A. Cooper, that there is little left for subsequent writers but to follow the descriptions given by that great Surgeon ; though several of the modern French Surgeons, especially Velpeau, Malgaigne, and Goyrand, have thrown some new light on the subject. The reason of the frequency of these dislocations is to be found in the shallowness of the glenoid cavity, the large size and roimded shape of the head of the humerus, and the weakness of the ligaments; Imt, above all, in the extent and force of the movements to Avhich the joint is subjected. These displacements indeed would be much more fre- quent than they even are, were it not for the protection afforded to the joint by the osseous and ligamentous arch formed by the coracoid process and acromionSPECTA L DISLOCxl TIONS. 476 AMtl. their hgamciits, the great strength of the capsular muscles and tlieir close conuec 1011 uith the joiiit, and the support given by the tension of the long part; but the principal obstacle to disloca- .1 1 1 ^ y 1C scapula, enabling all movements communicated to ttic^liand and arm to react upon that bone.

Cooper, the head of the bone was found to be thrown out of the glenoid cavity, lying under the coracoid jirocess upon the anterior jiart of the neck of the scajmla (Fig. 207) ; the capsular muscles were not torn, but the long head of the biceps had been mptimed. The description given by Sir A. Cooper, and the illustrative plate in his work on Dislocatiotis, appear to point to a form of injury of the shoulder-joint which has of late years been specially described by the French surgeons as a variety of the dislocation downwards ; that form of disjilacement, indeed, which by Boyer has been described as the dislocation “ inwards,” by Malgaigne as the “ snbcoracoid ” luxation, and by Velpeau as the “ subscapiilar ” dislocation ; in which the head of the humerus is placed in front of the neck of the scapula, and underneath the subscapular muscle. In this dislocation the head of the bone, instead of being thromi, asDISLOCATIOJSfS OF THE SIIOULDER-JOTNT. 477 in the subo-lenoid, do^niAvards and slig'btly inwards, is thrown inwards cither dirLtly oi^hghtly downwards as well Why Sir A. Cooper described this as r. par lid dislocation, I do not understand ; for not only was there rupture of tlie capsule and of the long tendon of the biceps, but the woodcut at page 401 of the last edition of his work shows clearly that the head of the bone had foimcd a new articular cavity for itself in the subscapular fossa, being appa- rently completely thrown out of the glenoid cavity. There is here less deformity than in the other luxations, the acromion not formino- so distinct a projection (Fig. 211). The limb is usually somewhat lengthened, but at times is actuaUy shortened, the elbow being generaUy car- ried backwards and always slightly away from the side ; the head of the bone is placed deeply in the upper and inner pai’t of the axilla, and cannot always be very distinctly felt, owing to its being thickly covered with soft parts, by the coraco- braclhahs as well as by the pectorals ; rotation of the arm and elevation of the elbow being usually reejuired in order that it may be detected. There may be pain from the pressime of the head of the bone on the nerves or from stretching, and if the vein be pressed an oedema of the v hole hmb Avill occur. 2. In the dislocation Forwards, or the Sub- clavicular (Fig. 208), the head of the bone is thrown on the inner side of the coracoid process, lying upon the second and third ribs mider the pectoral muscles, and immediately below the clavicle. This dislocation is merely an increased degree of the preceding one, the head of the bone, which at first lies under the coracoid process, being readily di’awn inwai’ds, so as to be placed to the inner side of this process under the clavicle. In these cases the capsular muscles are much stretched or torn. In a case recorded by Ciuling, the infraspinatus and subscapularis muscles were torn away from the tubercles of the humerus, and the teres minor partially lacerated ; the capsule being completely separated from the neck of the bone, which pressed forcibly upon the axillary vessels and nerves. In three cases which I have had an opportunity of dissecting and examining after death, the great tubercle was torn away from the head of the bone, with much laceration of the capsule and extensive extravasation, but the external rotator muscles were not ruptured in two instances ; whilst in the third the supraspinatus, the infr-aspinatus, and the teres minor, were all torn across near the insertions into the humerus. In fact, in these cases it appears to bo a cpiestion of strength between muscle and bone; either the muscles are torn across, or the great tubercle, into Avhich they are inserted, is torn away from the shaft of the boiie, lea'S'ing its attached muscles uiu'uptured. In this dislocation, the head of the humerus can be felt and seen under the pectoral muscles beneath the claAicle ; the arm is shortened, the axis of the limb being directed toAvards its head, and the elbow is a good deal separated fr’om the side and throA\m back.

The axis ot the hmb is altered, being directed backwards nearly horizontally ; the elbow IS raised from the side, to which it cannot be approximated, and is carried for- wards and somewhat downwards. 4. Ill the dislocation Downwards, or the Subglenoid (Fig. 210), the head of the bone lies in the axiUa, resting against the inferior costa of the scapula be ow the glenoid cavity, and lodged between the siibscapnlar muscle and the long portion of the triceps. In it the tendon of the snbscapiilar muscle is commonly torn near its insertion into the lesser tubercle of the hu- merus, and the capsular ligament is largely lacerated. The siipraspinatus muscle may also be torn through, or a portion of the great tubercle of the humerus detached, and the rest of the capsular muscles put greatly on the stretch. The axillaiy artery and plexus of nerves are compressed and stretched by the dislocated head of the bone, so that a severe numb pain is commonly experienced in the hand and arm. The compression of the artery is so great, that the circulation through the limb may be completely aiTested. This I saw remarkably illustrated in lacerated wound of the forearm, dividing the radial and ulnar arteries. So long as the dislocation remained imreduced, no hmmoiThage took place ; but when the head of the bone was replaced, the injm-ed arteries bled fr-eely. The head of the bone can usually be readily felt in the axilla, at its anterior and mider part ; the arm is lengthened to the extent of about an inch, the forearm is usually somewhat bent, and the fingers are often numbed, in con- sequence of the piressin’e of the head of the bone on the axillary plexus. The elbow is separated from the trunk and canied somewhat backwards, but can be approximated to the side. If the head of the bone caimot be felt in the axilla, its presence there may be ascertained, as Cooper directs, by raising the elbow, when it at once becomes perceptible. In a case which occiUTed to Cleland of Galway, the am was thrown up so as to reach above the patient’s head. This patient was lame and used crutches ; and Cleland supposes that one of tlie crutches, having slipped, acted as a ful- crum in such a way as to cause the weight of the body in falling to o^■cr- come the tendency of the latissimus dorsi and pcctoralis major muscles to draAV the arm towards the side. Reduction was readily effected. The dislocation of the humerus to which the term Partial is usually Fig. 212.—Suligleiioid Dislocation.479 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. applied, is that wldcli was described by Soden in 1841, in which the long tendon of the biceps is displaced from its groove or ruptured, and the head of the bone is thrown upwards and forwards under the coracoid process, but not out of the glenoid cavity. It is to this form of displacement also that Callaway seems disposed to confine the term partial. Le Gros Clark has recently published an accomit of a case in which there was partial dislocation of the head of the humerus behind and below the acromion. In this partial dislocation the signs do not appear to be A'ery evident. In Soden’s case there was slight flattening of the outer and posterior parts of the joint, and the head of the bone appeared to be drawn higher up in the glenoid cavity than usual. There was gveat pain induced by any movement of the biceps muscle ; and, on attemj)ting any ovei’hand motions, the head of the bone became locked by the acromion. A pecuhar partial dislocation of the humerus forwai’d, dependent on paralysis of the deltoid, will be discussed in the Chapter on Traimiatic Paralysis. Causes.—Dislocations of the shoulder-joint are in almost aU cases the result of falls upon the hand or elbow ; the particular variety of dislocation depend- , ing upon the direction of the shock communicated to the arm, and the position of the hmb at the time of receiving it. On this account we almost invariably find the displacement in a direction inwards and doumwards. When a person saves himself in falling with his arms widely stretched out, the head of the bone is chfr'en with all the force of a long lever against the lower and imier portion of the capsule, which, being ruptimed, in this its weakest part, allows the bone to be thrown upon or to the inside of the inferior costa of the scapula,, and thus into the axilla. When the patient falls upon his elbow, the inner part of the joint is still acted on ; but, the leverage not being so great, the head of the bone is throum upwards or forwards under the cla^dcle. This dislocation is also often the result of direct -^uolence apphed to the shoulder. The dislocation backwards can only take place if the arm receive the shock at the time when it is stretched across the chest. As this is an unusual position for any injury to be received in, this dislocation is proportionately rare. An obstacle to this displacement may also be found in the great strength of the outer portion of the capsule of the joint, as compared ivith the inner. Relative Prequency.—Sir A. Cooper states that the dislocation “into the axilla is the most frequent form of accident. This opinion is confirmed by that of most English Surgeons. But Malgaigne, and more recently Flower, have expressed the opinion that the subcoracQid is the most common form of this accident. Flower, who has very ably investigated this subject, finds that of forty-one specimens in the different London Museums, thirty-one are un- doubtedly siibcm-acoid, and that, of fifty recent cases of which he has cognisance, forty-four were of this fomi. Next in order of frequency comes the subglenoid, and then the suhdavicular, which is rare. I believe that the subclavicular is’ as it were, an exaggerated degree of the subcoracoid ; the continuance of the : same force, whether mechanical or muscular, ivhich had thrown or drawn the cad of the bone to the inner side of the coracoid process, carrying it upwards and inwards under the centre of the clavicle. The displacement of the head of the bone under the spine of the scapula is so rare that Sir A. Cooper met with480 SPEC I A L DISLOGA TIONS. two cases only of it; several cases have occuitccI at University College Hospital, which were reduced without difficulty. Diagnosis. Dislocations of the huurerus may readily be diagnosed from fractures of the ttnaiomical and surgical neclc of the bone, by the existence of the signs which arc common to all luxations, and by the absence of crepitus. In fractures in this situation, also, the glenoid cavity always continues to be occu- pied by the head of the bone. The existence of crepitus, and of slight shortening but little alteration in the axis of the limb, and no correspondence between this and the position of its head, are additional signs of value in establishing the diagnosis. The nature of the accident that occasions the injury is often an important element in the diagnosis. Fractures of the upper end of the humerus can only occur from direct violence applied to the shoulder. Dislocations, on the other hand, are almost invariably the result of indirect violence applied to the hand or elbow. Hence the injiuy resulting from a fall or blow on the shoulder itself is almost always a fracture ; that fr’om a faU on the hand or blow on the elbow a dislocation of the humerus. Paralysis of the deltoid from a hloio or from injury of the circumflex rierve may simulate a dislocation, the shoulder being flattened and the acromion projecting : but here the mobility of the .joint, and the presence of the head of the bone in the glenoid cavity, estabhsh the absence of dislocation. The Reduction of a dislocated humerus may be conducted on three different plans :—ly the heel in the axilla ; hy the hiee; or hj draiving the arm upwards. Whichever plan is adopted the patient should, if strung, be put imder the in- fluence of chloroform ; when his muscles are paralysed by this agent but little force is required to effect the reduction, the Surgeon s imaidcd strength usrrally sufficing for this piu’pose. If more power, however, should be required than he carr exercise, extension may be made by assistarrts drurving rrpon a touel pro^rerly fixed romrd the lower end of the hrrmerus, or else by the prrlleys attached to the same part of the limb. _ _ . • i 1 1. The reductiorr of the dislocatiorr hy the heel in the axilla, is certain y t cREDUCTIOF of dislocated shoulder-joint. 481 easiest procedure in ordinary cases. In adopting this plan, the patient is laid upon his back upon a low bed or conch, or even on the ground ; the burgeon, seating himself upon the edge of this on the same side as the dislocated arm, takes the limb by the wi-ist, and, fixing one foot firmly upon the gTonnd, places tire other, covered merely Avith the stocking, Avell up into the axilla, so that the heel may press against the loAver border of the scapula, and the foot act upon the humerus (Fig. 213). tie then draAVS the limb steadily doAvnAvards, and,^ when it is disengaged to a sufiiciout extent, brings the hand across the front of the patient, the foot acting as a fulcrum, by Avhich the head of the bone may be reduced by being pushed ujiAvards and outwards. This mode of reduction is especially sei’A'iccable in ordinary dislocations into the axilla, and in those under the claA-icle. In the latter, however, it ahU be necessary to draw the aimi more obhc^rrely doAA'nAA’ards and backAA''ards, and to press the foot someAAhat foi’AA aids upon the head of the bone, after it has been disengaged by being brought below the coracoid process. 2. The reduction hj the hiee in the axilla is precisely the same in principle as the last, though not by any means so good a plan ; the knee being too large, and not foUoAving the movements of the humerus so readily as the foot. In effecting the reduction by this means, the patient is seated on a chair ; and the Siu-geon, standing by his side and resting one foot upon the chair, places his knee in the patient’s axilla. He then seizes the patient’s arm aboA’e the elbow Avith his right hand, and, steadying the acromion A\dth his left, draws the limb well away from the body and then depresses it across the knee : the head of the bone is thus reduced. 3. In some cases reduction is easily effected by laying the patient on his back, when the Surgeon, sitting behind him, raises the arm Rej'penclkularly by the side of the head, at the same time fixing the acromion. The head of the bone is thus brought directly upwards into the glenoid cavity. If the patient be very muscular, or the dislocation of old standing, it may be neeessary to have recomse to the pulleys in order to effect reduction. In applying these the scapula must be firmly fixed, the counter-extension being made by passing the patient’s arm through a slit iu the middle of a jack-toAvel, which should be fixed fii’inly to a hook or staple in the wall. The extending force may then be applied immediately aboA'e the elboAV ; and faction being- made slowly and steadily in the direction of the axis of the limb. The head of the bone should be directed to the glenoid caAuty by the pressiu’e of the Surgeon’s hands, so soon as it has come on a level with it. In this way dislo- cations of the humerus of many weeks’ or eA'en months’ standing have been successfully reduced ; but iu employing those powerful means, especially under the influence of chloroform, the Surgeon should always bear iji mind that, unless care be taken, serious mischief, eA'en laceration of the axillary artery, may result (pp. 4G5, 4GG, 482, 483). After dislocation of the humerus has been reduced, the limb should be firmly fixed to the side for at least tAVO Aveeks. It may then be put iu a sling for another fortnight: and, at the end of a month, passive motion, vuth friction, may be employed. If inflammation occur about the joint, recourse may be had to leeches and evaporating lotions. After reduction, there is a tendency for the head of the bone to be draAva,482 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. upwax’ds aucl outwards under and against the acromion, oxving evidently to the deltoid and coraco-brachialis muscles not being counterbalanced in their actions by those that hax'e been separated from the head of the bone. Compound Dislocation of the Head of the Humerus is a rare accident. I have, however, seen two cases of it, and in two directions : dounwards— Siiifflenoid, and inwards—Sulcoracoid. In both cases reduction was effected, and the patients did well. In it, even though the injm-y be extensive, it is better not to amputate if the axiUaiy vessels and nerves be uniujm’ed. The limb may be saved by reducing the bone at once ; after this the Avound should then be closed and dressed lightly, and kept cool by constant irrigation. If the axillary artery be ruptimed, either completely or through its inner and middle coats, obstruction to the arterial circulation of the arm will ensue, and amputation must be perfonned through the articulation. Complications.—A SimfU Dislocation of the Head of the Humerus, with Rupture of the Axillany Artery and the formation of a diffused axillary aneiu'ism, is serious but fortunately rare. In a case of this kind, E. Adams, after reducing the dislocation, hgatimed the subclavian artery, the patient recovering : and this would be the proper practice to pursue in similar cases. A A'ery serious accident, and apparently difftcult to treat, consists in the complication of a Dislocation of the Humerus ivilh Fracture through the Epi- physis of the displaced bone. A case of this kind, to which I Avas called, is described at page 408. When the dislocation is complicated Avith a Fracture of the Shaft of the Bone, it should be reduced at once by putting the fractime up very finnly, and then attempting the reduction by one of the usual methods. In the cases to Avhich I have ah-eady referred (p. 468), I succeeded AAuthout difficidty by means of the heel hi the axilla. The fracture must then be treated by lateral splints. Congenital Dislocations of the Shoulder-joint have of late years attracted attention. R. W. Smith has ascertained, by post mortem examination, the existence of two varieties of this condition—the Subcoracoid and Subacromial luxations. In these there is wasting of the muscles of the shoulder and arm, the motions of Avhich are extremely limited, Avhilst those of the scapula ai-e preternatiu-ally great. The condition of the bones is also remarkable. In a case of congenital subacromial luxation of both shordders, there was no trace of a o-lenoid cavity; but a well-formed socket existed on the outer side of the neck of the scapula, receiving the head of the humerus, which was small and distorted. These dislocations, though existing fr-om_ birth, _ usuaUy become more marked as age advances, but are necessarily irremediable, ^ in consequence of the malformation of the osseous structures and the wasting of the muscles. , Old Unreduced Dislocations of the Head of the Humerus are not i n- frequently met with. In the majority of these cases there is a consideiable amount of pain and immobihty about the shoulder at first; but after a time the head of the humerus forms a new bed for itself, ai^ the movements of tlie arm become freer and less painful, so that eventually a hmb useful foi all except the OAm’head movements will result. In cases of old dislocation of the head of the humerus, the question asOLD UNREDUCED DISLOGuiTION OF HUMERUS. 483 the advisability of attempting reduction always presents itself to the Surgeon. As a general ride this should always be attempted under chloroform, in accordance with the principles laid down at p. 4(J4, if only a few weeks have elapsed from the time of the accident, and then it ^vill usually be attended with success. Reduction has been eftccted in many cases at much later periods than this ; by Brodhurst, after twenty-five weeks had elapsed ; by Smitli (U.S.), after six, seven, eight, nine and ten months ; by Malgaigne, alter eight months; by Caron du Pillard, after six inonths ; and by SediUot, after a year. By the use of the subcutaneous division of muscles, &e., Diefifenbach is said to haA'c succeeded in reducing a dislocation of the shoulder after it had existed two years. In many cases, however, at a much earlier period than these, the Surgeon will fail, notwithstanding the most persevering attempts at reduction ; and in others again certain accidents have occurred, which evciy Surgeon should bear in mind, so as to render him cautious in his proceedings. The Accidents that have ocem-red in attempts at reducing old-standing dislo- cations of the head of the humerus are such as may arise either from the employment of an undue amount of force, fr’om the separation of the head of the humerus fr’om the adhesions that it has contracted in its new situation, or fr’om pathological changes in the limb itself. Among the first are laceration and bruising of the skin, subcutaneous areolar tissue, and muscles, with extra- vasation of blood : amongst the latter are fr’actiue of the humerus, laceration of the axOlary vessels and nerves, and avulsion of the hmb. Fracture of the humerus has occiured in the practice of many Sm’geons of eminence. It has happened to Petit, Pott, Larrey, Berard, DenonviUiers, and others. The siugical neck of the bone appears to have usually given way ; and the accident has not ocemued so much fr’om forcible extension, as in caiTying the ai-m across the chest so as to tilt the head of the bone into its place, when the shaft becomes exposed to fracture by pressure in a transverse direction. Such an accident necessarily prevents aU further attempt at r reduction. I Fracture of the ribs, by the pressiue exercised against the wad. of the chest, is supposed to have occuiTed in some cases. The extravasation of a large quantity of blood into the areolar tissue of the axilla has occasionally ocemued, without any evidence of the rupture of one of the main vessels. In these cases the swelling has gradually subsided under the employment of ordinary treatment, by rest and evaporating lotions. More serious by far than this is the rupture of one of the targe blood-vessels in the axilla. This may either happen from the pressure of the Surgeon’s heel, as in a case reported by Hamilton, in which an attempt was made to reduce a dislocation of old standing by this means ; the Surgeon unfortimately for- getting to remove his boot, and thus contusing and lacerating the artery. Or It may occur from the humerus having become adherent to the vessel, and lacerating this when tom away. Tlie instances on record of laceration of the ^illaiy artery, and the consequent formation of a diffuse traumatic aneurism m the axilla, in the reduction of old dislocations, are so numerous—there bein°- at least twelve cases in the records of smgery—as to act as a warning to the Surgeon not to employ too much force. I I 2484 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. In the gi-oat majority of these cases—in at least ten ont of the twelve—the diffused traumatic aneurism appeared immediately after the employment of forcible and long-continued extension. In tlic rcmaiiiiug two instances, the aneurismal tumour did not appear until after the lapse of some time. In Dupuy- tren’s case a woman, sixty years of age, had a dislocation into the axilla of six weeks’ standing reduced. Two or throe months after this, a tumour appeared in the armpit. This was mistaken for an abscess, and opened ; arterial hasmor- rhage ensued, and the patient died on the eighth day, from secondary bleeding. In Nekton’s case the patient, also an old woman, had a subglenoid dislocation which was easily reduced. But an anemdsm appeared in the axilla, which, three months after the reduction, compelled that distinguished Surgeon to tie the subclavian. Both these aneurisms were probably circumscribed. Dupuytren’s case was not the only one in which the fatal mistake was com- mitted of opening the aneiu’ism in the axilla—the same was done by Pehetan, ■who mistook the tumom’ for an emphysema; the result being of necessity fatal. In cases reported by Yerduc, Petit, Platner, and Leudet, the aneiu’ism was allowed to run its course unchecked by ef&cient singical treatment, and in every instance proved fatal by the sac giving way, and secondary haemorrhage cnsuuig. Sir C. Bell records a case that occinred at the Newcastle Infii-maiy, in which the pectoral muscles as well as the artery were torn, and immediate amputation became necessary. In foin- cases the subclavian artery had been ligatiu’ed. All these happened in America ; two to G-ibson, one to Blackman of Cincinnati, and one to Warren. Three of them proved fatal by secondary htemorrhage, Warren’s being the only one in which recovery took place. What Treatment should be adopted in this distressing accident ? If the aneurism be left to itself, or be treated by inefficient means, it must necessarily prove fatal by its rupture or sloughing and secondary haamonhage. The ligatine of the snbcla-kan is not very promising, as a fatal result occinred in three out of the four cases in wliich it had been tried for diffuse aneinism. Nekton’s case having been circumscribed. In these circumstances, it appears to me that it would be -wiser to apply to these cases the usual principle of treat- ment that is adopted in cases of diffused axilkiy aneurism from other causes ; \iz., to compress the subclavian, lay open the sac, turn out coagida, and tie the torn artery at the seat of injury. In one case, the dislocation being of twenty days’ standing, and the patient a female 2G years old, Froriep states that reduction was followed by sudden and extensive tinnefaction of the axilla, syncope, and death in an hour and a half A 2^ost mortem examination disclosed laceration of the axilla) ij vein, ho mention is made of any internal injiny to account for death. Injmy to the axillary nerves dining reduction leading to paralysis of the arm has also been described. A case of this kind is mentioned by Bilhoth as having occinred in a patient under his care at Zurich. The dislocation iras of nine months’ standing, and had been attended with partia paralysis of the arm and sotne muscular atrophy. The reduction was foUowedby total paralysis, which Bilhoth attributes to laceration of the axillary nerves m consequence of their having become adherent to the bone. • n 4? n ,i Besides these accidents, other ekl consequences have occasionally followed prolonged attempts at reducing old dislocations of the bnmerns, such as siuldcr485 dislocations of the elbow. death from sijncoDe, and exhaustion. Guf-rin’s remarkable case of avulsion of the Uml) at the elbow in a woman 03 years of age, in an attempt to restore a dislocated humerus three months after the luxation had occurred, is an instance of an accident that is as yet unique in the records of surgery. In this case no imdue amount of force seems to have been used, but the tissues of the limb had become softened and porous—partly probably from disuse, partly from senile changes. In the event of the Surgeon being unsuccessful in his attempts at reduction, he must endeaA'Oiu’, by means of frictions and passive motion, to restore, as far as practicable, the utility of the limb. In some of these cases of old reduced dislocation, I haA'c succeeded in very materially improving its condition by putting the patient under the influence of chloroform, and mooring the limb fr-eely to and fr-o so as to loosen, stretch, and break up the adhesions about the head of the bone ; and it is in this way that attempts at reduction, even though unsuccessful in replacing the head of the bone, are often of great use in improving the mobihty of the limb. In cases of old standing, where symptoms of pressime on the large vessels and nerves are present, and where there is danger of their being injured in the attempt at reduction, BiUi'oth recommends excision of the head of the bone. This has been done successfully by Langenbeck in a case of paralysis from pressime. Dislocations of the Elbow are by no means mifrequent accidents ; and, as they are often occasioned by direct violence, in consequence of which much swell ing speedily sets in, their signs are fr-equently obscured, and the diagnosis is rendered proportionately difficult; more especially when the dislocation happens to be complicated with fr’actiu’e of the articular ends of the bones. In these cases, indeed, it is only by an accurate acquaintance with the normal relations of the osseous points, and by a comparison between those of opposite sides, that the Siu’geon can detect the true natime of the injury. The Varieties of dislocation of the elbow-joint are very numerous, either both bones of the forearm or only one being implicated. 1. Both Bones.—The most common dislocation is that in which both bones are throivn Baclcivards, with or without fractiu’e of the coronoid process. This injiuy is readily recognised by the projection backwards of the olecranon, caiTying with it the tendon of the triceps. The articular end of the humerus also can be felt projecting in front of the elbow. When the coronoid process is not broken off, it is fixed against the posterior siu’face of the humerus, the forearm being inmiovably placed in its new position. When this process is fractured, there is great mobility about the joint, and crepitation may be felt as the arm is drawn forwards. Dislocation of both bones Forwards can scarcely occur without fracture of the olecranon. Eare as this accident must be, there are at least five cases on record by Colston, Lana, Delpech, Canton, Forbes of Philadelphia, and Date, in which the bones have been so displaced ivithout this process being broken. In this injuiy the elongation of the forearm, the projection of the condyles of the humerus, the presence of the sigmoid notch in front of the arm and the depression of the posterior surface of this bone, render the diagnosis sufficiently easy. In one case at University College Hospital, the injury ivas produced by the natient, a man 20 years of age, slipping on the pavement and.falling on hisSPECIAL EISLOGATIONS. 486 elbow. In this instance tbe elbow was mncli bent ; it could be brought to a right angle, and straightened considerably. The forearm was three quarters of an inch longer than its fellow. The condyles of the hmnerus were on a level Avith the olecranon; the tendon of the triceps was very tight, and the sigmoid notch could be plainly felt on the fore part of the arm. The head of the radius could also be felt in front of the humerus. In the case recorded in the Lancet, 1872, by Mr. Date of Crewkerne, the dislocation was forwards and outwards, so that the head of the radius lay outside the external condyle. At the same time, the epiphysis at the inner condyle was separated. When the olecranon is broken off, there is elongation of the forearm and great mobility, but the detached fragment can be felt behind the humerus. The Lateral dislocation of the bones of the forearm is almost invariably in- complete ; either the head of the radius hitching against the internal condyle, or the ulna coming into contact with the external one. Complete lateral dislocation of the bones of the forearm is excessively rare : the only instance Avith which I am acquainted is a luxation outwards, reported by N61aton, of which he has given a woodcut. The ulna or radius alone may be displaced ; and in some cases, both bones are dislocated, but in opposite directions. 2. Ulna.—The only dislocation to which the ulna alone is subject is that in a direction BackAvards. Although this displacement may occiu’ in an uncom- plicated form, it is more frequently associated Avith more or less dislocation of the head of the radius. When it occm's, it may be recognised by the projection of the olecranon backwards, and by the head of the radius being felt in its normal situation, or nearly so, dming the movements of pronation and supination. In some extremely rare cases the coronoid process is fractmed at the same time, causing ready disappearance and reciUTence of the dislocation, with crepitus. 3. Radius.—The radius alone may be dislocated fonvards, lachiuards, or outivards. The dislocation ForAvards is certainly the most common. In the many instances of it that I have seen, it has resulted from a fall on the palm of the hand, by which the loAver end of the radius is driven backwards, while the upper end is tdted forwards Avith the whole force of the leverage of the bone, and in this way, ruptiu'hig the annular ligament, is throAAui against the external condyle. The signs of this displacement are the folloAviug. The fore- arm is slightly flexed, and in a mid state between pronation and supination ;' any attempt at completing the latter position occasions great pain, as does also the endeavom’ to straighten the arm. The elboAV can only be bent at an obtuse angle, in consequence of the head of the radius being suddenly brought up against the lower end of the humerus, against which it strikes vrith a sudden shock (Figs. 214, 21G). On rotating the radius much pain is experienced, and the head of the bone can be felt to roll on the fore part of the hiuuerus, the external condyles of Avhich project unnatmaUy. The hand and arm can be fully pronated, but cannot be supinated more than halt Avay. The Avhole of the outer side of the arm is deformed, being earned someAvhat upwards (Fig. 215). The ruptime of the annular ligament in this dislocation makes it very ditflc'ult to keep the head of the radius properly fixed, so as to prevent a recmi’ence of the displacement. In some cases, and indeed not unfrequently, there is incomplete disloca-dislocation of the RADIUS. iS7 tion of the radius forwards, ai’ising cither from frrlls upon the hand, or from violent twists of the foreai-m. In these we have the preceding signs, though Fig. 214. -Dislocation of the RacUus forwards : Limit of Power of Bending the Ai-m.

The most characteristic symptom, however, is the patient’s inabihty to flex the forearm upon the arm. This he can never do to a greater extenthhan to bring the elbow to a right angle (Fig. 214). On being told to touch the tip of his shoulder with his fore-finger, he wiU find it impossible to do so. The dislocation of the radius Backwards is extremely rare ; it may always be recognised by the head of that bone being felt subcutaneously behind the external condyle ; the movements of the elbow, and of the radius especially, lieing at the same time veiy hmited and painful. Di.slocation of the radius Outwards is of more frequent occiurence than the last injury, the head of the bone being thi-own on the outer side of the external condyle, where it is felt under the skin, rolling as the hand is moved.' The natiu’al motions of the joint are of course greatly interfered with. The radius and ulna are sometimes displaced in Opposite Directions, the ulna being thrown lachwards, and the radius forwards. This injury, of which lhave seen two instances at the hospital, usually results fr-om heavy falls upon the hand, with a wreneh of the limb at the same time, as when a person isSPECIAL DISLOCA TIONS. 4SS thro’wn out of a carriage and liglits upon Lis hands, in consequence of whicli the bones are twisted and displaced in opposite directions. Tlie deformity is of course great, but is I'cadily recognised by the combination of the characters of the two forms of displacement, provided an examination bo made before the swelling has come on, which rapidly sets in. Complications.—Dislocations of the elbow-joint are A-ery frequently com- plicated Avith fracture of one or other condyle of the humerus, of the olecranon, and—as we have already seen in displacement of the ulna, and more rarely —of the coronoid process. In these complicated injuries an exact diagnosis is often extremely difficult, OAving to the laxity and mobility of the parts, and to the great tumefaction that accompanies accidents of this description. It is in these cases that a good knowledge of the relative bearing of the different osseous points, aided by a comparative examination of the opposite limb, will alone enable the Siugeon to effect a proper diagnosis of the natme of the injury. ' The mode of RedAiction in dislocations of the elbow-joint varies according as the ulna is displaced or not. When the ulna is dislocated, in whateA'er direction it may be thrown, and whether the radius be displaced at the same time or not, the great obstacle to reduction is the hitching of the processes of the bone against the articular end of the humerus. If either the olecranon or coronoid process be fractiued, this entanglement cannot take place, and the joint then readdy slips into its position, though it is very difficult to maintain it there. The reduc- tion of the displaced ulna, Avhen uncom- pheated by fracture, may always be effec- ted, as Sir A. Cooper has recommended, by bending the arm over the knee. The patient being seated on a chair, the Sur- geon rests one foot upon the seat, and, placing the knee in the bend of the injured elbow, grasps the forearm Avith both hands (Fig. 217); fixing the arm, he presses the knee firmly against the inner aspect of the forearm, so as to disengage the ulna from the lower end of the humerus, and at the same time he bends or pushes the forearm into proper position, into which, uideed, it has a tendency to returiff by the action of its own muscles, so soon as the opposing osseous siufaccs are separated. In dislocations of the radius, this movement across the knee as not neces- sary. ' All that is reqimnd is to fix the upper aim, and then employing extension from the An’ist, to straighten the arm well; AAdien, by benffing ^ elbow at right angles, the head of the radius may be pressed into a proper ^°Aftci-’reduction has been effected, the hmb shoidd be firmly put up in Fig. 217.—Dislocation of the Ulna : Eetluction.OLD DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW. 489 lateral aiio-ular splints, the hand being kept semi-prone.

When this has subsided, passive motion may be commenced, and frictions and douches employed, so as to remove the stitfness that is apt to be left about the joint. In those cases in which the dislocation is complicated with fractoe of some part of the articular ends, and in ivhich the diagnosis of the precise nature 01 the injury, owing to the swelling or other causes, has not been very clearly made out, the joint should be placed in as good a position as possible, by a process of traction, flexion, and moulding, so as to bring the osseous points into proper bearing with one another; the angular splints must then be applied and local antiphlogistic treatment employed. At the end of a month or five weeks passive motion may be commenced, lest permanent rigidity come on, which is very apt to siipeiwene. Compound Dislocations of the Elbow are always very serious injuries. In their treatment, the Siu’geon will usually have to decide between resection of the articular ends of the displaced bones and amputation of the arm. He will be guided in his course by the amount of mischief done to the soft parts. If these be simply lacerated over the posterior aspect of the joint the dislo- cation, when compound, being almost invariably backwards—the wound may be enlarged, and the articular ends removed. Should the soft structures be extensively contused and torn, the brachial artery or the median nerve injured, and the bones fractmed as well as dislocated, amputation wifi, be the safer course. In determining on the hue of practice, however, the Surgeon will be guided by the considerations stated at p. 416, in reference to compound fracture of this joint. In some instances recovery has taken place with a very useful limb, even after severe compound dislocation of the elbow-joint, com- plicated with rupture of the brachial artery. Old-standing Dislocations of the Elbow are reduced with much difficulty in all cases in Avhich the ulna is coulpletely displaced ; this is owing rather to the interlocking of the irregular articular siu’faces and to the formation of adhesions in the torn capsule and around the displaced bones, than to muscular contraction. The tendoii of the triceps, and even that of the biceps, has been divided in some of these cases of old-standing dislocation of the elbow, in order to facilitate reduction. In those instances in which I have done this operation or seen it adopted, but little, if any, good has resulted ; and I have known troublesome sloughing to ensue. As a general rule, I believe that it will be found extremely difficult, even under anaesthesia and with the aid of the pulleys, to reduce an ulna that has been completely dislocated for more than a month. When the ulna is only partially dislocated, even though the radius be completely displaced, reduction may be efl'ceted without much diffi- culty at a much later period—it is said, as late as two years after the but here the difficulty is not to effect but to maintain the reduction accidentSPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. 490 and keep the bone in position, as it has a constant tendency to slip forwards and outwards. Provided a dislocated elbow can be so far reduced as to allow tlie forearm to be bent at a right angle, an useful arm Avill be left. Dislocations op the Whist are of rare occuiTcnce; so much so, that their existence has been denied by Dnpuytren and other modern Surgeons of gi’eat experience. Although there can be no doubt tliat fractures of the loAver end of the radius, more especially of an impacted character, have often been mistaken lor these displacements, yet there can be now no cpiestion that they do occa- sionally, though rarely, occur. Any doubt that may formerly have existed upon this point, in consecjncnce of the Avant of post mortem examinations, has been in recent years cleared up by the dissections of cases that haA^e been made by Marjolin and Voillermier. The observations of these Surgeons, together AAith those preA'iously made by Sir A. Cooper, tend to show that dislocation of the Hand and Carpus from the radius may take place either hciclcwcivds or forwards. These accidents are occasioned either by falls on the palm, or by the hand being forcibly bent forwards. In falls on the palm, the hand may be thi'OAAOi forwards inider the bones of the forearm, lying on their palmar aspect. In forcible bending of the hand forwards, there may be displacement of it and the carpus backwards on the dorsal aspect of the radius and ulna. In the Dislocation of the Hand and Carpus BackAvards the Dorsal displacement—there Avill be shortening of the length of the hmb below the elbow, with a large dorsal prominence occasioned by the carpus overlapping the lower end of the radius, which bone Avill be felt and seen as a projection on the palmai’ side. In the other variety of radio-carpal dislocation, the Hand and Carpus are throAvn PorAvards under the radius and ulna on their Palmar aspect. This dislocation is il- lustrated in the accompanying figm-c taken fr’om a cast sent to me by Cadge of Norwich (Tig. 218). In it the projection of the styloid process of the uhia and the lower end of the radius form a concave line on the dorsal aspect, overlapping the cai-pus, Avhich lies on the pahnar side of the radius. _ _ The Diagnosis of these injm-ies has to be made fr-om sprains ot the yis , from simple and from impacted fractmes of the radius.

Reduction, which is readily effected, must be maintained by the Application of antcro-postcrior splints of sufficient length to take Compound Dislocation of the Wrist, AVithout fracture of the bones of the foreaim, is a rare accident. In one such case which came under niy care at the Hospital, in consequence of injmy inflicted on the arm by machinery, the hand was thronm forwards, the radius projecting backwards, and the soft structures on the palmar aspect of the joint were so extensively torn through as to necessitate amputation. The Treatment of such a case mil depend on the amount of injury done to the soft parts. If these be not very extensively injin-ed, an attempt may be made to save the limb ; but if they be widely torn, through, the ai-teries and nerves lacerated, and the tendons perhaps hanging out, amputation will be required ; this occinred, and the operation was per- formed, in the case to which I have just referred. This wifl be rendered more imperative if the bones of the forearm be comminuted as well. Congenital Dislocation of tlie Wrist may take place either forvards or backwin-ds. The limb is in either case greatly deformed. The bones are shortened and altered in shape, more especially the lower end of the radius. The muscles are also shortened, the extensor tendons forming a shaiqi angle as they pass over the carpus. Dislocatiojts OS’ SiifGLE BosTES OF THE CARPUS are by no means frequent. The bone that is most commonly displaced is the Os Magnum. This accident usually happens from falls, in which the hand is violently bent forwards, in consequence of Avhich this bone starts out from its articulation, projecting as a round hard tumour on the back of the wrist opposite to the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. It may be readily reduced by being pressed upon Avhile at the same time the hand is extended. There is, hoAvever, a great tendency for this bone to slip out again, leaving considerable weakness of the joint; so much so, that, in two cases recorded by Sir A. Cooper, the patients found it necessary to wear artificial supports. The Pisiform Bone is occasionally dislocated upwards. In a case under my care, it was displaced by an effort to hft a heavy weight, and draAvn up the arm to a distance of nearly an inch by the flexor carpi ulnaris. A case some time ago occurred to me, at the Hospital, in which the Semi- lunar Bone AA'as dislocated. The patient had fallen from a height, injiu’ing his spine, and doubling his right hand under him. On examining the wrist, a small hard tumoin’ was felt projecting on its dorsal aspect ; it readily disap- peared on extending the hand and employing firm pressme, but started up again so soon as the Avrist was forcibly flexed. It was eAident that this bone belonged to the first roAV of the carpus, articulating A\ith the radius ; and from its size, its position towards the radial side of the carpus, and its shape, Avhich could be veiy distinctly made out through the integuments, there could be little doubt that it Avas the semilunar bone. Taaffe, of Brighton, has related a case in which the semilunar bone Avas dislocated anteriorly, so that it jirojected upwards and forAvards betAveen the radius and ulna. Dislocations of the Metacarpal Bones.—Tlie Metacarpal Bones may possibly, though very rarely, be dislocated from the carpus. This acci- dent usually happens to a single metacarpal bone ; Avhich, in consequence of492 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. some extreme degree of violence, is forced out of its bed and is tin-own back- wards on the carpus. Most frequently, this accident is the result of injury and shattering of the hand by gun-barrel or powder-flask explosions ; and in such cases the metacarpal bone of the Tliumh is the one that commonly suffers, the dislocation being also usually compound, and complicated with fracture of the holies and extensive palmar laceration. Dislocation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, however, is rare, though the articulation between this bone and the trapezium aj)pears at first not to be of a character to resist much external violence. This is probably owing in a gi-eat measure to the powerful muscles by which the bone is supported in all cases in which the force is ap- plied upon its palmar aspect, as it most frequently is, as well as to the little leverage offered by so short a bone. Luxation, however, of the metacarpal bone of the thumb has been observed to take place fonoarch as well as haclc- wards, the latter being the most common. The Reduction is in general easy, extension being made from the thumb by means of a piece of tape apphed round the fii’st phalanx. Next to the metacarpal bone of the thumb, those of the Index and Middle ringers are most liable to dislocation backwards : sometimes complete, at others incomplete. I am not acquainted with any case on record in which all the metacarpal bones have been dislocated from the carpus. The annexed engraving (Fig. 219) is from a cast in Uni- ■\'ersity College Museum, taken from a patient in the Hospital, in whom I believe that this accident must have occiu-red ; the hand being thrown forwards and shortened, and the carpal bones forming a rounded and convex prominence on the dorsum of the metacar- pus. The convex appearance of this corresponds with the outline of the carpal bones, and differs so very remarkably from the concave aspect of the lower end of the radius and uhia, as seen in the radio-carpal dis- location (Fig. 218), that I think there can be httle doubt as to the natm-e of the injiu-y sustained by the patient. The Treatment of such cases will be the same as that for ordinary dislocations of the caiqDal bones; splints of sufficient length to take in the hand being ap- plied, after reduction, in order to maintain the parts in position. Dislocations of the Metacaepo-Phalangeal Articulations are by no means of common occin-rence. They are usually produced by Ms on the hand, and are met with at all ages ; most commonly in the yoimg adult, but some- times at an earher age. I have seen this accident in a child four yeais old. Most frequently the Proximal Phalanx of the Thnmh is the bone that is dislocated, being thrown haclcivard on the metacarpal bone (Fig. 220) in such a way that the articular sin-face of the phalanx rests upon the back of the meta- cai-pal bone immediately below its head. The signs of the accident are sufficiently evident. In the normal state of the hand, the metacarpo-DISLOCATION OF THE THUMB. 493 phalano-eal articulation of the thumb is convex backAvards : in this dislocation it becomes convex towards the palmar aspect and angularly concave behind. The head of tlie metacarpal bone can be Mt and seen projecting on the palmar aspect of the thumb. The proximal phalanx stands up as it ivere upon the back of this bone, but the articular surhice ol the phalanx cannot be felt, owing to its being in contact AAuth the posterior part of the metacarpal bone just above its neck. The phalangeal articulation is always semi- hexed. This dislocation of the proximal phalanx of the thumb has, owing to the difllculty of its reduc- tion, attracted more attention from Sm-geons than it Avould at hrst appear to deserve. So great has this difficulty been in some cases, as to render the dis- location iiTcdiicible, notwithstanding the employment of as much force as it was safe to use, and that most skilfully directed, or to compel the Simgeon to have recourse to operative interference in order to replace the head of the bone. The obstacle to the ready reduction of this small bone has been attributed to different causes. Thus, Hey supposed that it was owing to the constriction of the neck of the bone between the lateral hgaments of the joint. Dupuytren entertained a very similar opinion, looking upon the malposition of these ligaments as the principal source of difficulty. The folding in of the apterior ligament of the joint, and the interposition of a sesamoid bone between the articulating sm’faces, have also been looked upon as giving rise to this peculiar difficulty in reduction. The more probable explanation, however, appears to be, that the narrow neck of the metacarpal bone becomes locked between or constricted by the two terminal attachments of the short flexor of the thumb, Avhich must be carried back over its broader head, together with the displaced phalanx ; the head of the metacarpal bone being grasped betAveen these tendons and the torn capsule of the joint, like a stud between the sides of a bntton-hole. The observations of Yidal, Malgaigne, and Ballingall point to this as the cause of the gi’eat difficulty in reduction that is often met with. Reduction.—Although, as has been said, great difficulty in reduction is often met AAuth, it would be a gneat error to suppose that it always exists. On the contrary, very many of these dislocations are, under chloroform, most readily reduced by simple traction and manipulation (Fig. 220). Should any difficulty be experienced, the foUoAAdng plan aaiII usually answer. The hand and metacarpal bone being fixed by an assistant, the Surgeon bends back the thumb, so as to bring the phalanx to a right angle Avith the metacarpal bone on Avhich it is displaced. He noAV employs traction in the axis of the displaced portion of the thumb, keeping the metacarpal bone W’ell pressed down into the palm. Having thus unlocked tlie phalangeal articular surface from the back of that bone, he draAvs it Avell fbrAA'ards, and, AA’hen it is opposite the head of the metacarpal bone, bends it doAvn into the palm. In this Avay I haAc reduced a dislocation of the phalanx backAvards betAveen five and six AA'eeks after its occurrence. Simple traction in the straight direction, hoAACA’er forcible, and oven when aided by the pulleys, Avill do little if any good in the reduction of494 • SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. tins dislocation, as tlie only effect is to diwy tlie slit in the capsule and the two heads of tlie short flexor more tightly than ever round the neck of the bone. Vciy se\ere extension has been employed without any effect; and there is the tiadition in the surgical profession in Jjondon of a thumb hai'ing' been dragged off in the attempt to reduce this dislocation by pulleys. If the Siu’geon fail in reducing the dislocated phalanx by manipulation under chlorofonn, as above described, or by traction, what is to be done ? In these circumstances, the dislocation should not be left without a fiu’ther effort to replace the bone ; and this may usually be readily enough done by the subcutaneous section of the resisting structures. The Surgeon must bear in mind that the obstacle to reduction is purely mechanical; that muscular contraction has nothing to do> with it.; and that it is quite as great when the patient is antesthetised as when he is not. He must therefore enlarge the slit in the capsule, and divide the tense bands formed on each side by the tendinous attachments of the short flexor. This operation is best done by passing a tenotome through the skin in front of the joint, and cuttiug first on one side, then on the other. The chief resistance will be found on the uhiar side of the thumb, where the tendinous insertion of the adductor poUicis is probably divided at the same time as that of the short flexor of the thumb. After these structines have been cut through, the phalanx can be replaced, and the thiunb shoifld be put up securely between splints. AVhen reduction has been effected, care must be taken to prevent the recur- rence of the displacement. This is best done by keeping the thiunb bent into the palm, and retaining it there by means of a gutta-percha cap moulded over it and bandaged dovm. If the dislocation be left luu-educed, the thumb will to a great extent become useful, but necessarily shortened, deformed, and incapable of much flexion. In Compound Dislocation of this joint, the bone may usually readily be replaced ; should there be any diflaculty in retaining the bone in position, its head must be removed, the dislocation being then reduced with great readiness, and the wound treated in a simple manner. Dislocations between the Phalang-es rarely occiu. These dislocations arc partial or incomplete, and usually consist of a twist of the second upon the proximal phalanx. I do not think that simple dislocation of tke migual phalanx from the second is possible. Partial dislocat on of the middle pha- lanx, which is a very common accident, is readily recogiused by the deformity it entails (Fig. 222), and is easily reduced by pressure and traction in properbiblocations of the femuf. 495 directions. A very com-enient mode of applying traction is by means of the toy called an “Indian pnzzle,” which gnasps the fingei tightly the more it is pulled upon. 1 he finger will continue to be stitf and comparatively useless lor some leno-th of time. The joint being swollen and tender the patient can generally bend it, but cannot extend it ful y or bear any traction upon it. This condition is especially apt to be troublesome and chronic if the patient be gouty, or if his general health be otherwise deranged, and requires rest and local countcr-imtation, with an antipodagTic treat- ment, for its remedy. In Compound Dislocatton of he phalanges, the bone should be replaced, the finger supported by a gutta-percha splint, and the wound dressed lig y. In some cases it is necessary to remove the projecting end of bone before this can conveniently be done : ankylosis then results, a sufficiently useful finger being left. Fii;.

DiSLOCATio^rs OF THE Pelvis.—It often happens that, in consequence of severe blows upon or compression of the peMs, the Symphysis of the Pubic Bones, or more frequently the Sacro-iliac Articulation, is displaced. Here the natiu’e of the injury is indicated by the deformity that results ; and the same treatment is required as in fracture of the pelvis, with which these accidents are commonly associated. The Coccyx is sometimes violently bent, and almost dislocated/orzm/rfe by falls ; or it may be forcibly bent baclmards dmiing violent partm’ient efforts. These accidents may be remedied by manipulation thiough the lectiim ; but are apt to be Mowed by that painful nemialgic affection Coccydynia, described at p. 426. Dislocations of the Demur.—^Notwithstanding the great depth of the acetabulum, the complete manner in which the head of the thigh-bone is received into its cavity, the fiivaness of the capsular hgament, and the great strength of the capsular muscles that siuTound and support the joint, disloca- tions of the hip are more frequently met with than those of many other joints that appear less perfectly supported. This is doubtless in a great measure owing to the action, on the head of the femur, of the gveat length of leverage of the thigh-bone itself when external violence is apphed to the knee, and of the whole of the loiver extremity when the violence is applied to the foot. The different forms of dislocation of the femur were described with great clearness and precision liy Sir A. Cooper, who showed that its head is most commonly throAvn upwards and somewhat backwards, so as to lodge on the slightly concave surface between the acetabulum and the crista ilii, resting on the gluteus minimus, and having the trochanter turned forwards (Fig. 223); or the head may be throivii downwards into the foramen ovale, lying upon the obtm-ator externus muscle (Fig. 225) ; or forwards and upwards upon |i the horizontal branch of the pnbic bone under the psoas and iliacus muscles, to the outer side of the femoral A'essels (Fig. 226); the head of the bone may also be thrown backwards into the sacro-sciatic notch, resting upon the pyrifor-SPEC IA L DISLOCA TIONS. 496 mis muscle (Fig. i24). Tlieso arc the four forms of the dislocation of the hip stated by Sir A. Cooper to be the most usual, and this statement has been fully confirmed by the accumulated experience of more modern Surgeons. Besides these, liou'ever, may be added, as not very unfrequent, that form in which the bone is thrown backwards and somewhat downwards behind the DISLOCATIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE THIGH-BONE, Fig. 223.—Upwards and Fig. 224.—Baolnvards somowliatBaokwai'ds, into Sciatic Notch, on Dor.smn Ilii.

The extent of mischief done to the soft parts around the joint lai-ies in different dislocations. In aU, the capsulai- ligament is torn in a gi-eater or less extent in the direction of the displacement. The extent and exact situa- tion of the laceration of the capsular ligament are matters of great nnportance, as on a con-ect appreciation of them depends in a great measure the facility or difficulty in reduction, and the means to be employed m effecting it.

In the dislocation on the dorsum ilii. Sir \ "’cooper found the gemelli, obturatores, and cpiadratus completely tom across', and the pectineus slightly torn. In the dislocation into the sciatic notch Billard d’Angers found the gluteus maximus and medius torn, and toe <.emelli riiptm-ed. Syme found the gluteus maximus extensively torn, -with the head of the bone imbedded in it; the gluteus minimus, the pynformis, and the gemellus superior lacerated; and the head of the femm- lying upon the o-cmelli and the great sciatic nerve. In the displacement on the obtimator foramen, the pectineus and adductor brc^^s are torn. In the dislocation on the pubic bone, the extent of injmy is more uncertain. In one case related by Sir A. Cooper, Poiipart’s ligament was torn up, and in another the pectineus and adductors were torn ; but whether this was done by the dislocation or by the direct injiuy that occasioned it, is uncertain. Dr. MacCarthy has described the appearances found on dissection in two cases of dislocation of the femim on to the dorsum ilii. In one, the deeper fibres of the gluteus maa- miis had been torn by the head of the bone, which was found lying 'with its anterior part on the brim of the acetabulum, with the lowermost fibres of the gluteus minimus interposed, and the dimple for the ligamentum teres directed backwards and inwards. The posterior fibres of the gluteus medius were also torn, and the pyriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli muscles had been completely torn from their pelvic attachments. The quadratus femoris was uninjiu’ed. The capsule had given way posteriorly; in front and above it was intact. Although some fibres of the ligamentum teres had been ruptured, the ligament still resisted aU attempts to break it. The ilio-femoral and pubo-femoral bands 'were uninjined, notwithstanding that the acetabulum had separated into its three component parts, the fractiu’e transversing also the iho-pectineal eminence. The lowermost fibres of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, and some fibres of the sar- torius, psoas magnus, and iliacus internus muscles were also ruptmed. In the second case, the gluteus maximus was not torn, but the bmsa between it and the vastus externus was seen to be ruptm-ed and filled with blood. The sheath of the great sciatic nerve was also distended with blood, and the nerve-fibres W'ere separated from one another. The posterior fibres of the gluteus minimus muscle were tom across, and the areolar tissue beneath that muscle filled with blood. The quadratus femoris muscle was torn completely in two, and the uppermost fibres of the adductor magnus, and some fibres of the gemelli and obtm’ator internus muscles, were lacerated. The capsule was perfect in front and above, but torn at the most posterior part. The ligamentum teres had been torn off’ close to the femoral attachment. The importance of the ilio-femoral ligament in the mechanism of disloca- tion of the hip-joint, has been fully recognised by various Surgeons. Gunn of Chicago, Busch, Von Pitha, and, more recently and fully, Bigelow^ have insisted on an exact knowledge of this important ligament as constituting the basis of a correct understanding of the mechanism, not only of the various forms of dis- location of the hip, but also of the proper mode to be adopted for their reduc- tion. Bigelow, to whom we are especially indebted for a most lucid exposition VOL. I. K KSPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. 498 of the subject, gives this structure, from its shape, the name of the Y-ligament; and he believes that, while its branches arc unbroken, one or other of the four regular dislocations of the hip will occur : the particular dislocation depending upon the relative positions of the head of the femur and the ilio-femoral liga- ment. In no case, however, do any of the muscles, except, perhaps, the obtirrator internus, exercise any influence on the displacement. When the Y-ligament is ruptiu’cd, an irregular dislocation, the signs of which may be un- certain, will occiu’. The strength of this ligament is always great, although it vai'ies much. Bigelow has found that its breaking power in the dead body ranges from 250 to 750 pounds. ‘The next stnicture of most importance, as has been pointed out by Bigelow, is the ohturator intermis. muscle. He has shown that its muscular body is usually intermixed with tendinous structure. In consequence of this aiTange- ment, it acquires great strength when contracted, and, indeed, becomes practically an accessory hgament. Bigelow classifies dislocations of the head of the thigh-bone into Regular Rislocatiions, in which one or both branches of the Y-hgament remain im- broken ; and Irregular, in which the Y-ligament is wholly ruptiu’ed. The Te^'uldT dislocations in which both branches remain entire, are : 1, Dorsal; 2, Dorsal below the tendon (ischiatic of Cooper); 3, Thyroid and downward ; a, obliquely inward on the thyroid foramen ; 1), obliquely inward as far as the perina3iun ; c, vertically downward beneath the acetabulum ; d, obliquely out- ward as far as the tuberosity ; 4, Pubic and Subspinous ; 5, Anterior oblique. Those in which the external branch is broken are : G, Supraspinous; and 7, Everted Dorsal. _ ^ ^ a With regard to the relative frequency of the various forms of dislocation or the hip. Sir A. Cooper says, that of 20 cases of dislocation of the hip, 12 will, on the average, be on the dorsum ilii, 5 on the sciatic notch, 2 on the obtiuator foramen, and one on the pubic bone. Hamilton states that, excluding anoma- lous cases, of 104 cases of dislocation of the hip which he has coUected, 55 were on the dorsum ilii, 28 into the sciatic notch, 13 into the obturator fora- men, and 8 upon the pubic bone. Dislocation of the hip-joint chiefly occurs in young or middle-aged adults. In veiT old people, fractime of the neck of the femim will commonly be pro- duced by the same violence that would have displaced the head of the bone at an earlier ao-e. In children dislocation is rare, as the shaft generally gives way. Yet it does happen even at a very early age. Two cases have ocem-red m my practice at the Hospital. In one the bone was dislocated on the pubic bone, in a child a year and a half old ; in the other on the dorsum ihi in a boy of sixv For convenience of description, and with a view to practical utility, we may -in-ano-e dislocations of the hip-joint in three principal varieties. _ 1 Dislocations Upwards and Backwards.—The most common (hsloca- tion is that in Avhich the head of the bone is tin-own uimards and laclcwcirds Sel-- of the iU»m, or rather upon "S displaeement differs so slightly in its pathology and ™ tion into the seiatio noteh (Kg. 224), desenbed as 0 ^^ A ti™n^ injiuyby Sir A. Cooijer, that I think it is more consistent w ith the tiuenatmREDUCTION OF DISLOCATION OF IIIP-JOINT. 499 of these accidents to look upon them as essentially the same ; the displacement in both cases being upwards and backwards, but in dificrent instances partaking more of one or other direction. This dislocation may therefore be described as the Ilio-sciatic; it corresponds with Bigelow’s first and second classes of regular dislocation. 2. Dislocation Downwards.—J^’ext in order of frequency to the ilio-sciatic dislocation is the Th3rroid, in which the head of the bone is thrown downwards on the obturator foramen (Fig. 225). The downward dislocations include also those on the perimeum and beneath the acetabulum. 3. Dislocation Upwards.—In the Pnbic variety, the head of the bone is thrown upward on the pubic bone (Fig. 226). In a more rare variety of upward dislocation, it may lie below the anterior inferior spine of the ilium. Thus it -will be seen that, in whatever direction the displacement occiu’S, the head of the bone has a tendency to sink into some cavity or depression, or to lie upon one of the osseous sm-faces in the neighboiu’hood of the aceta- bulum. It is also probable that the hip can be partially dislocated. In the Reduction of dislocation of the hip-joint, two methods may be employed. The first, or the old method, consists in making extension by means of forcible traction by pulleys or othermse in the direction of the axis of the displacement of the limb, and overcoming, by main force, any obstacle arising fr’om muscular contraction or ligamentous resistance. The other, or modem method, consists in the employment of manipulcbUon, by which is meant the avoidance of aU force, the relaxation of the muscular structures by flexion, and the disentanglement of the head of the bone from any ligamentous obstacle by impressing on it various rotatory move- ments, each adapted to the particular case. Originally advocated by Nathan Smith in 1831, extended by Eeid of Eochester (U. S. A.) in 1851, this method has now in America, and veiy commonly in this country, superseded the forcible extension of Sir A. Cooper and the older Surgeons in the reduction of all recent dislocations of the hip. In those of old standing, extension by means of the pulley is still required, as by manipulation sufficient force caimot be exerted^ to overcome those secondary causes of resistance that become developed in such cases. There is a third method—that by angular extension, invented by Ponteau •, but, as this is less effective than either of the others, and nevei, I belie’^e, now employed, its consideration need not detain us. I shall desciibe each method of reduction in connection with each of the principal fonns of dislocation of the hip. Upwards and Backwards, or Ilio-sciatic. If the head of the bone rest upon the dorsum of the Ilium (Fig. 223), the hip will be found 0 e a good deal distorted, the gluteal region being somewhat prominent, and e upper part of the thigh enlarged, in consequence of the approximation of e musciflar attachments, so as to give an appearance of widening to the hip. ^6 felt in its new situation, more especially on aing the limb; the trochanter is less prominent than natural, usually png c ose against the brim of the acetabulum, and being turned forwards • there .sharked shortening, varying from one to two imhes in sol latV sarilv^? inches.

The position of the limb is remarkable, being dis- tinctly rotated inwards, with the thigh slightly bent upon the abdomen, and the leg upon the thigh, so that the knee is semi-flexed, and raised from the siu'face on which the patient is lying. The foot is inverted, so that the ball of the great toe rests on the instep or against the ankle of tbe sound limb ; and the heel is somewhat raised. The axis of the dislocated thigh is directed across the lower third of the sound thigh. The movements of the joint are greatly impaired : abduction and eversion are not practicable ; but inversion, abduction, and some flexion upon the abdomen, can be practised. AVhen the patient is lying flat, with the knee slightly raised and advanced, the lumbar spine is on its proper level; but if an attempt be made to straighten the knee, so that the limb lies flat, the lumbar spine will arch forwards. W^hen the head of the bone shps a little further back so as to become lodged in the sciatic notch., we have the dislocation “ backwards of Sir A. Cooper’; or, as Bigelow calls it, “ dorsal below the tendon,” because the head of the bone lies belorv the tendon of the obtiu-ator internus muscle (Fig. 224). In this the same symptoms exist, though to a less degree ; hence the diagnosis is pro- portionately difficult. There is much less deformity about the hip in this variety of the displacement, orving to the head of the bone sinking into the hollow of the notch, and thus presenting the trochanter nearly in its usual position at right angles with the ilium, though somewhat behiird and a little above its irormal situation. In consequence of the head of the bone being received in a depression, the axis of the limb is not altered to the same extent as when it is thrown upoir the plane sm’face of the dorsum ilii; hence the inversion of the knee and foot, though existing, is usually not so strongly marked. Bigelow, however, says that the inversion is greater in the dislocation “ below the tendon ” (Fig. 227). As the sciatic notch is but a little above the^ level^ of the acetabulum, the shortening of the hmb is inconsiderable, not exceeding half an inch or an inch at most. The axis of the linib also is directed across the sound knee. Thus the signs of these two forms o is oca- tion are nearly identical in character, though varying in degree ; the principal. axis of the femiu’ is directed to the opposite knee, whereas, when the head o the bone is lodged on the dorsum ihi, the axis of the hmb is directed across ■ ' the lower part of the sound thigh. , . i i Causes.—dislocation upwards and backwards is that which most frequently met with in the hip. It is occasioned by he' limb whilst adducted, with the body bent forwards upon thigh upon the abdomen; as when a person is struck on the ‘ ^ weight, or is thi’own forwards, or falls whilst cm-i^ng a ‘ Jpole of shoulders, when the upper and posterior part of the ]oni receiv the strain. In these chcumstances, the capsular ligament is ruptuied, and th bone slips out of its articulation. Muoli inversioi^. (Bi- gelow.) 4REDUCTION OF ILIAC DISLOCATION. 501 The Diagnosis of this form of dislocation is easy in proportion as the head of the bone lies high on the dorsiun ilii. The more it sinks towards and into the sciatic notch, the more difficult docs the detection of the displacement become, and the greater the risk of its being overlooked altogether, or mistaken for a sprain. °In ordinary cases of fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, the ever- sion of the limb at once points out that the head of the bone is not dislocated oil the ilium. The only severe injury of the hip with which the disloca- tion upivards and backwards can be confounded, is the rare case of fractw & of the neck of the thigh-hone, with inversion of the limh. In this accident, the increased mobihty, and the existence of crepitus, will enable the Surgeon to effect the diagnosis. Should, however, the fracture be an impacted extracap- sular one, with inversion, then the difficulty of diagnosis is undoubtedly great. A correct conclusion may, however, be arrived at by observing that in the fractiu'c the flattened trochanter is approximated to, and is in nearly a pei’pen- dicidai’ hne with, the anterior superior spine of the ihum ; whilst in the dislocation the trochanter is diagonally behind that process of bone, and the head of the thigh-bone can be felt in its new situation by deep manipulation of the gluteal region. HeductioxL of Iliac Dislocation by notation.—The patient being laid on his back and fuUy ansesthetised, the Surgeon flexes the thigh upon the abdomen, so that the head of the bone is hfted out from behind the acetabu- lum. The limb should now be slowly abducted, and rotated outwards. By this manoeuvre the head revolves around the great trochanter, which is fixed by the outer branch of the Y-ligament, and rises into its articular cavity. The movement is facihtated by carrying the limb downwards as weU as out- wards. Bigelow has summarised the movements necessary to effect reduction in this way in the following words, ‘‘Liftuf), hend out, roll out.” In some cases slight rotation imuards, instead of outwards, succeeds best. In others, again, it may be necessary for the Surgeon to place his foot, covered only with a stocking, on the anterior superior spinous process, to steady the pelvis while he raises the bent knee. Reduction by Extension is effected in the following manner. The patient, having been put under the influence of chloroform, is laid on his back upon a strong table. One staple should then be fixed in the floor near the head of the bed at the side eomsponding to that of the dislocated limb, while another staple 22s.-norsm Dislocation, noductiou l,y Rotation. 1H IO 1Trrr\l 1 ^ ... .0_ _J_ H’Bn B mill •■I11-I11 ii. is placed in the wall at the foot, above the level of the body, in a direct line with the axis of the limb, and about twelve feet from the other. The limb baa been flexed and abducted, and it remains 01 dy to evert it and render the outer Branch of the Y-ligamcnt tense by Rotation. (Bigelow.) The counter-extending force must then be made by a jack-towel or a padded leather belt passed between the injiu’cdSPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. 502 tliigli and the perineenm, and fixed to the staple in the floor. The pulleys mnst now be attached to proper straps, or to a towel fixed with a clove-hitch knot immediately above the knee, at one end ; the other extremity being attached to the staple in the wall, which shonld be so situated as to be con- tiimons with the axis of the lower part of the hmb. The knee being then slightly bent and rotated inwards, traction is applied slowly and steadily until the head of the bone has approached the acetabulum, Avhen the Surgeon rotates the hmb outwards so that the head may shp into its socket (Fig. 229). The Fig. 229.—Redur.tion of Ilio-sciatic Dislocation Uy Extension. fact of the reduction being accomplished is ascertained, by comparing the bony points of the limb with those of the opposite side, and seeing if they corre- spond. A long splint and spica bandage shonld now be applied to fix the thigh, and the patient be kept in bed for a fortnight, so that reunion of the ruptured tissues may take place. In reducing this dislocation, there is some danger of the head of the bone shpping downwards into the sciatic notch, if the limb be too much raised. This accident, which has happened to some veiy exceUent Singeons, may be mistaken for reduction of the bone; a serious mistake, Avhich Avould, unless corrected, entail permanent lameness. Reduction of recent Dislocation into the Sciatic Notch should be effected by Manipulation. This may usually be done by laying the patient flat on his back, fixing the pelvis, raising the thigh at a right angle so as to unlock the head of the bone and bring it below the acetabulum. It my be jerked mto this cavity by bringmg the foot down and rotating outwards at e A. Cooper foiuid gi’eat difficulty in the reduction of the dislocation ; and he and Lisfranc, amongst other Surgeons, have failed to rediice it by extension. In the reduction by Extension, the patient is laid on his soimd side instead of on his back, and extension is made over the middle of the opposite thigh instead of immediately above the knee, as in the iliac dis- of these dislocations, if diffleidty arise in raising the bone over the edge of the aoetabnhnn, recom-se may be had to the plan » Astlev Cooner of lifting the head of the bone out of the notch and ovei the fdge of the acrtabnlnm by means of a ronnd tmvel placed '“f.

Bi^^elow describes as allied to the sciatic dislocation (dislocation below me tcndoli), and constituting a stage of it, that displacement in which the head of the hone is thi-own downwards and outwards towards the tuberosity o± the ischium, lying on the posterior part of the body of that bone between the tuberosity and the spine, ihe head of the bone can be felt in this situation; and the limb is inverted (Fig. 230). Bigelow considers this as a first step towards luxation behind the tendon, which it tends to become when the patient is upright. 2. Dislocation Downwards.—Of this class of dis- locations, that on the Thyroid Foramen is the most frequent. In it, the hip is flattened, and the pro- minence of the trochanter completely absent, or indeed replaced by a depression. The hmb is lengthened by about two inches, advanced before the other, and con- p. siderably abducted (Fig. 231). The knee is bent and incapable of extension ; the foot usually points for- wards, but is sometimes shghtly everted, and is widely separated from its fellow. When the patient stands, the body is bent forwards in consequence of the tension of the psoas and iliacus muscles, and in a thin person the bone may be felt in its new situation. When he hes on his back, the knee is much raised and the thigh flexed. Causes.—This dislocation appears to be occasioned by the hmb being sud- denly and violently abducted, as by falls with the legs widely separated ; in 230.—Dislocation Down- wards and Outwards to- wards the Tuberosity below Tendon.

(Bigelow.) consequence of which the head of the bone is tilted against the iimer side of the capsule, and, rupturing this, is thrown into the thyroid notch.5°4 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. Reduction by Manipulation iimsfc be clone as follows. Tbe limb having been flexed on the abdomen so as to bring it into a pei’pendicnlar position, must be slightly abducted so as to disengage the head of the bone. The thigh is then to be strongly rotated inwards, and adducted, the knee being earned towards the floor (Fig. 232). Reduction by Extension is to be done in the following manner. The patient is laid on his back ; the counter-extencling girth, or towel, is then placed round the pelvis and fixed firmly to a staple next to the sound side of the patient. A padded girth is then to be placed between the perinseum and the upper part of the dislocated thigh. From this, extension is made by means of the tourniquet or the pulleys, which are fixed to a staple at a little distance from the injiu’ed side of the patient. Extension having then been made to such a degree as to elevate the head of the bone from the de- pression in which it hes, the Sim- geon passes his hand behind the sound leg, and, seizing the ankle of the injined limb, presses it backwards and draws it towards the mesial fine, taking care to keep the knee straight, and thus throwing the head of the bone into the acetabifiumby the action of a long lever (Fig. 233). The following are more rare forms of dislocation downwards. The head of the thigh-bone may be thrown directly downwards, so as to rest on the lower margin of the acetaluhm, between the sciatic notch and the thyi’oid foramen. Two cases of this injiuy have been recorded by Gmmey of Camborne, and one by Luke. In it, there is less eversion of the limb than in the thyroid dislocation (Fig. 234). Bigelow has pointed out that the head of the'bone, when throivn below the lower margin of the^ acetabiilimi, may be further displaced ; either backwards on the dorsiun ihi, or forwards to the thyi-oid foramen. In extreme flexion, however, the head may pass down as far as the iuberosiiy or the ascending ramus of the ischium; in the former case the limb is everted, and in the latter inverted, and in all cases flexcc . The head of the bone may also pass into tbe pennseum, so as to be te in its abnormal situation behind the scrotum. It has been ^ the urethra, and thus give rise to retention of urine. The thigh is extreme y abducted and stands out at a right angle with the body ; anc e ocs may Fig. 233.—EecUietion of Dislocation into Obtm-ator Foramen l)y Extension.DISLOCATION ON THE PUBIC BONE. 5°5 cither inverted or everted—which is ascribed by Bigelow to the want of firm bearing for the trochanter in the perinajum (Fig. 235). Fig. 234.—Dislocation directly downwards. (Bigelow.) Fig. 235.—Dislocation downwards and Inwards towards PeriniBUin. (Bigelow.) In the Reduction by Manipulation of these two rare forms of dislocation downwards, the thigh is to be bent and its head guided towards the socket. Dm’ing this, the dislocation is sometimes converted into one of the thyroid or sciatic variety. In the dislocations downwards, vertical traction and slight inward rotation may be used ; in the dislocations downwards and outwards, traction upwards and inwards, with abduction and rotation outwards ; in the displacement downwards and inwards, traction upwards and outwards. Probably allied to these forms of dislocation is that in which the head of the bone has been found thrown downwards and backwards into the lesser sciatic notch. In these cases there is considerable shortening, but the position of the limb appears to vary. In an instance that occurred to Keate, the limb was abducted and the toes tinned outwards. In a case reported by Wormald, the limb was turned inwards. Although the limb is described as shortened in these cases, Warren has related a case in which it was elongated. 3. Dislocation upwards.—The dislocation upwards on the Pubic Bone presents very unequivocal signs. The hip is flattened ; the head of the bone can be distinctly felt lying in its new situation above Poupart’s hgament, to the outer side of the femoral vessels, where it may be made to roU. by rotating the limb. The thigh and knee are slightly flexed, rotated outwards, and abducted ; the limb, which is separated from its feUoiv, is shortened to the extent of an inch (Figs. 236, 237). The Cause of this dislocation is either direct violence applied to the back of the thigh whilst the hmb is abducted ; or it arises from the patient making a false step in walking, and suddenly throwing his body backAvards in order to avoid a fall, twisting and displacing the limb. The Reduction by Manipulation should be efiected by drawing the limb doAvnwards, and at the same time raising it up so as to flex it gradually on the abdomen as the head of the femur becomes disentangled from its position. It may then be rotated inAvards, and the head of the bone thus directed toAvards the acetabulum. With regard to the Reduction by Extension, Sir Astlcy Cooper advises5o6 SPECIAL DISLOCATION'S. that the patient should lie upon his hack with his legs widely separated ; and that, counter-extension being then made by a girth earned between the 236.—Pubic Dislocatiou. (Bigelow. Fig. 237.—Pubic Dislocation. Head of Bone in Groin susi)ended by Y-ligameut. (Bigelow.) perinseiun and the injui’ed thigh, and fixed to a staple in front of and above the body, the pulleys should be fixed upon the lower part of the thigh, and the extension made downwards and backwards. After this has been continued for a sufficient time, an assistant lifts the head of the bone by means of a towel over the brim of the acetabuliun (Fig. 238). Fig. 238, Bediiction. of Pubic Dislocatiou by Extension. The head of the thigh-bone may also be thrown under the anterior inferior spinous process, constituting the Subspinous Dislocation ot Bigelow. There is shortening of the limb, which is everted, but less abducted or advanced than in the dislocation on the pubes. The head of the bone can be felt in its new situation. , t>- . i ,r.

(Bigelow.) reduction of old dislocations. 5°7 describes also Supraspinous Dislocation uitli or without rupture of the outer branch of the ligament. If this be not ruptured, the dislocation is caUed by him cintevior ohhQito: in it, the thigh lies across the upper part of the corresponding limb, and is hrmly locked in that position, m’th much shorten- ing and some eversion. Itcductioii may be clfected by extension of the limb and increased ciicumduc- tiou across the symphysis, with a little eversion if necessaiy to dislodge the head of the bone. By inward rotation, the head of the bone is throum on the dorsum. Ill the true suprasjnnous dislocation, the outer branch of the Y-ligament is ruptured : the limb is shortened and c’l'erted. In a case related by Cum- mins, the limb ji’as shortened three inches. Re- duction may be effected by ch’cmnduction mwards and eversion, by which the dislocation is rendered dorsal, and may be thus reduced as aheady directed. Everted Dorsal Dislocation may ocem.’ when, in dislocation on the dorsum, the outer branch of the Y-hgament is broken: the integrity of this portion being necessary for the inversion of the limb. Irregular Dislocations of the head of the thigh-bone occiu’ when the Y-ligament is wholly ruptimed. The displacement may take place in any of the above described directions : but the characters are inconstant. Reduction of old Dislocations of the Hip-joint is attended not only with great difficulty, but with no small amount of danger. The probabihty of effecting reduction rapidly decreases with the length of time that the bone has been left unreduced, and this more in some dislocations than in others. Thus it is easier to reduce an old dislocation on the dorsum ilii than one into the sciatic notch. Dislocation of the head of the thigh-bone on the dorsum of the ilium may usually be reduced uuthout any great difficulty, up to the end of the first fortnight. After that time the difficulty increases considerably ; and, although reduction has frequently been effected in these cases up to the sixth or eighth week, yet it has also not unfrequently failed, notwithstanding per- severing and repeated attempts. After two months have elapsed, the reduction is not only a work of gi’eat uncertainty, but also of no slight danger fi’om sup- pm’ation in the soft parts, or fracture of the femur; and it is then seldom practicable. But cases have been reported, and are refeiTcd to at p. 464, in Avhich these dislocations have been reduced at a much later period, even as late as six and nine months. If the bone be left permanently um’educed, it will in time acquire consider- able mobility, more particularly if lying in the sciatic notch, the patient walking readily uith a shortened but otherwise useful limb. The attempt to reduce old dislocations of the hip-joint is necessarily attended with more or less danger. In some cases the soft parts have been extensively lacerated ; in others fatal infiammation of the joint has ensued ; and, in elcA'cnSPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. 5o8 cases Avith Avhich I am acquainted, the thigh-bone was fractiu-ed. This accident has happened to Surgeons of such eminence as Tra\'ers, Vincent, Malgaignc, Physick of Philadelphia, to GAvynne of Brighton, to Blackman of Cincinnati, to Harris and Randolph of the Pennsylvania Hospital, to the Siu’gcons of the Ivorthem Hospital in Liverpool, and to a practitioner in London noAV hA'ing. In most of these cases the bone gave Avay at its neck or beloAV the trochanters; the dislocation was of coiu’se left unreduced, but the patients recovered Avithout difficulty, the fractime being treated in the usual Avay. The cause of the fractiu'e usually appears to have been the employment of force in a transverse or rotatory manner, after extension had been kept up for some considerable time. There is no proof that midue Auolence was used in any of these cases. It is probable that in some the femur had become Aveakened by disuse of the limb. The Complication of Fracture of the Femur with Dislocation of the Hip-joint occasions a very serious state of things, that may baffle the most skilful efforts on the part of the Siu'geon. The line of practice to be adopted must depend in a great measure on the seat of fracture. If this be situated below the middle of the thigh, the limb should be put up tightly in temporary splints, and an attempt made under chloroform to reduce the dislocation in the ordinary way by puUeys applied over the splints, or by manipulation. If the fracture be high up, near or at the neck, the patient should be put mider chloroform, and an attempt then made by pressure on the dislocated head and manipulation to replace it. It is possible that this might be effected, as in similar injuries of the humerus, AAuth comparatively httle trouble. Should reduction in this way not be practicable, w'e may adopt the plan successfully employed by Badley, who, in a lad of eighteen, with dislocation on the dorsum ilii, and fractiue of the chsplaced bone, allowed union of the fractiue to take place, and then at the end of five weeks effected reduction. Simultaneous Dislocation of both. Hips, perhaps in different directions, or of one hip AAuth fractm’e of the opposite thigh-bone, has been met with in some rare instances. Congenital Dislocation of one or both hips is occasionally seen. In these cases the spine is bent forwards in the lumbar region (lordosis): the trochanter is approached to the anterior superior spine of the ilium ; the thigh seems shortened; and the head of the bone may be felt on the dorsum fiii. The patient walks well, but Avith a peculiar rolfing motion. There is little to be done in the way of treatment beyond the use of mechanical supports. Dislocations or the Patella are not fr’equently met ivith. They may, noAvever, occm’ in foiH directions, viz., ouhvards, imvards, edgeivise or veriiccdhj, and upivards. . 1. The dislocation Outwards is the most common variety of the accident; the bone being throAAm upon the outer side of the external condyle of the femiu', ATith its axis dhected somewhat backwards and downwards, so that the inner margin is directed forwards, but sometimes the outer boiher is the more prominent. The knee is flattened in front, and is broader than usual ; the patella can be felt in its new situation, and the muscles that form the quadi’iccps extensor are rendered tense, more especially the A'astus internus ; t e eg is some times extended, but more frequently the knee is slightly flexed. ns acci endislocation of the patella. S°9 usually happens from sudden muscular contraction, especially in prsons who are knock-kneed. In some cases it has been occasioned by direct violence, the bone out of its position. Most frequently, the patella is only partially displaced outwards, with some rotation of the bone in the same direction Holthouse {Lancet, vol. ii., 1872) has recorded a case of congenital dis- location of the patella outwards. The abnormality was met mth in a boy a-cd seven, who had been admitted into the Westminster Hospital for fracture of the left femur, milst putting up the fracture, it was observed that the right patella was so displaced that its inner articular facet rested on the outer condyle, and that when the knee was flexed the dislocation became complete. The/e was no inclination inwards of either knee. The mother alleged that the condition had existed from birth, and that at first both knees were aftected. The boy could run and jimip as well as other children, and was not more liable to fall than they. ^ , . , , • , • . i 2. The dislocation Inwards is very rare ; Malgaigne, who has investigated this subject, is of opinion that there is only one case of the kind on record.^ In these lateral dislocations. Reduction may be effected by laying the patient on his back, bending the thigh on the abdomen, and raising the leg so as to relax the extensor muscles. The Surgeon then, by pressing down that edge of the patella which is fiu’thest from the middle of the joint, raises the other edge, which, beuig tilted over the condyles, is immediately drawn into position by the action of the extensors. 3. A remarkable form of dislocation of the patella is that in which this bone becomes tivisted upon its axis in such a way that it is placed Vertically, one of its edges (usually the outer) being fixed between the condyles, and the other projecting under the skin, and pushing this forwards into a distinct tumour. In some cases, as those of Woolf and Mayo, the bone has been turned almost completely round, the posterior articular siu’face becoming partly anterior. The signs of this dislocation are evident, manual examination indicating the vertical displacement of the patella, with a deep depression on each side. The hmb is completely extended, flexion being impossible. This pecuhar dislocation is of very rare occurrence, there being not more than about fourteen cases on record. It has most generally arisen from sharp blows or severe falls upon one edge of the patella, whilst the limb has been semiflexed,’in consequence of which the bone appears to have been semirotated and fixed in its new position. Violent muscular contraction, however, con- joined with a tmst of the leg, but without any blow, has been known to produce it in some cases. The Reduction of this displacement has sometimes been very difficult; in other cases it has been readily effected ; whilst in two or three mstances it has been found to be quite impracticable; Surgeons having ineffectually attempted by means of elevators and the section of the tendons or of the ligamentum patellre, to replace the bone, and the patient having eventually died from traumatic suppuration of the joint, with the displacement inuelieved. The cause of this difficulty of reduction is not very distinctly made out; it is cer- tainly much greater than can be explained by simple muscular contraction, and may not improbably be owing to the aponeurotic structiues which cover the bone becoming twisted or entangled under it, or, as Malgaigne supposes, to the510 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. superior angle of the bone lieing Avedgod in the Hulcondyloul space. If relaxa- tion of the muscles of the thigh, and the employment of proper pressure upon the patella, do not succeed, reduction may perhaps be effected by the patient making a sudden and violent muscular effort at extension of the limb, or by attempting to Avalk. In other cases the bone has been readily replaced by bending the leg, and rotating it on the axis of the tibia, at the same time that the patella is pressed into position, as Vincent recommends. Upon the Avhole, forcible flexion of the knee appears to have answered better than any other method, and under chloroform Avill probably seldom be attended by difficulty. Should these plans not ansAver, I do not think it would be advisable to have recourse to subcutaneous section of the tendon of the quadriceps extensor and of the ligamentum patellm. In one case in which both these structures were divided, the patella remained as firmly fixed as ever, and the patient eventually died of suppurative inflammation of the knee-joint; and in no case in which dmsion has been practised does it appear to have facilitated reduction. 4. Dislocation of the patella Upwards can only occur in consequence of the ruptiu’e of its ligament. This accident, AAUich is ahvays accompanied by much inflammation of the joint, requires the same treatment as a fractured patella. Dislocations op the Knee.—This joint, oAving to the breadth of its articular siu’faces, and the great strength of its ligaments, is seldom dislocated. When such an accident happens, it usually arises from falls from a great height, or by the patient jumping fr’om a caiviage in motion. The tibia may be dis- placed in fom’ directions : to either side, forwards, or laclcwards. Besides these displacements, the joint is subject to a partial luxation, dependent upon displacement of one or both semilunar cartilages. 1. The Lateral dislocations of the tibia are the most common. They are always incomplete, and are usually accompanied by a certain degxee of rotation of the limb outAvard. These displacements may either be External or Internal. In the first, the outer condyle of the femur rests upon the inner articidar sur- face of the tibia. In the other, the iimer condyle is placed upon the outer articular surface of the head of this bone. In either case, the knee is slightly flexed ; there is a marked sulcus in the situation of the ligamentum patella) ; the extensor muscles of the thigh are relaxed, and the deformity of the joint indicates at once the natime of the displacement. In these cases Reduction is always easy ; indeed, it is occasionally effected by the unaided efforts of the patient or by a bystander. It may be accom- plished by flexing the thigh upon the abdomen, then extending the leg, and, at the same time, by a movement of rotation, replacing the bones in their ^ 2? The dislocation Backwards may be complete or incomplete. When it is complete, the posterior ligament of the joint is tom, the muscles of the ham^ are stretched, the limb is shortened to the extent of an inch and a half or two inches, and is semiflexed ; the head of the tibia can be_ fel in the ham, and there is a deep transverse depression in finiit of the joint immediate y beloAV the patella. 3. The dislocation than the last accident. of the tibia Forwards is of more frequent occurrence In it, the loAver end of the femur is felt projecting intoSUBLUXATJON OF THE KNEE. the ham, compressing the vessels to such an extent occasionally as to an-est the circulation through the lower extremity, lacerating the ligaments, and stretching the muscles in this situation. The tibia projects forwards, its head forming a considerable prominence on the anterior part of the knee, with a deep depression immediately above it and the patella, which is rendered more evident by the relaxation of the extensors of the thigh ; the leg is usually rotated somewhat inwards or outwards, and there is shortening to the extent of about two inches. These antero-posterior dislocations are very commonly incomplete. T\Tien this is the case, they present the same symptoms, but in a less marked degree, than characterise the complete displacements. In the Treatment of these dislocations, extension shoidd be made from the ankle whilst the thigh is fixed in a semifiexed position. When the leg has been dravm domi sufiiciently, proper manipulation will bring the bones into accurate position ; sphnts must then be apphed, means taken to subdue local inflammation, and the joint kept perfectly at rest for two or three weeks, at the end of which time passive motion may be commenced. Subluxation of the Knee, or ‘‘internal derangement of the knee-joint,” is a more frequent accident than any of those that have just been described. It usually ocem-s fr'om the patient, whilst walking, striking his toe against or tripping upon a stone, when he is suddenly seized with acute and sickening- pain in the knee, often so severe as to cause him to fall. Before doing this, however, he is conscious of having strained or otherwise injured the joint. On examination it will be found semifiexed, the patient being unable to extend the limb properly, and every effort being attended by severe pain; and the edge of the semilunar cartilage may usually be felt projecting under the skin. In the course of a very short time the joint becomes swollen, being distended by syno- vial secretion; and symptoms of subacute synovitis speedily appear. This accident, originally described by Hey, and since investigated by Sir A. Cooper and others, occurs in consequence of the semilunar fibro-cartilage slipping away fr’om under the internal condyle, either before or behind it, so as to bring the surface of the condyle and that of the tibia into direct apposition. The severe pain that is always expei-ienced is owing in aU probabihty to the nipping of the loose folds of synovial membrane that he within the joint—the so-called mucous and alar ligaments, and also to the great stretching of the ligaments by the partial displacement of the bones. dhe Reduction may be effected by flexing the joint, and then, when the muscles are off their guard, the patient’s attention being directed elsewhere, rapidly extending it at the same time that a movement of rotation is commimi- cated to the leg. The evidence of complete reduction consists in the restoration of the power of extending the articulation. The synovitis that usually foUows this injury requires to be treated by local antiphlogistic remedies and rest. After it has been subdued, the patient should wear a laced knee-cap, as the joint will be weak, and hable to a recurrence of the injury. Complications.—Dislocations of the knee-joint are more liable to serious complications than those of any other articulation. Hot only are the ligaments tom, and the muscles injured, but stretching, and perhaps laceration^ of the popliteal vessels, followed by gangrene of the limb, may occur ; or the joint may faU into a state of suppinative and destructive inflammation.512 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. Compotmd Dislocation of the Knee-joint is one of the most serious injuries to whicli tlie limbs are liable ; the external wound being usually large, ragged, and accompanied by the protrusion of the condyles of the femiu’, with much laceration of the soft structures in the vicinity of the joint. These are cases that certainly, as a general rule, call imperatively for amputation ; indeed. Sir A, Cooper regards this injury as especially demanding removal of the limb. Cases, however, have occurred in which the limb has been saved. Hence, if the patient be young, and if the vessels of the ham do not appear to have been seriously injimed, the wound in the soft parts at the same time not being very extensive, nor much bruised, an attempt rnay with propriety be made to save the joint. In a case of compound dislocation of the knee forwards in a boy, A. A\Tiite sawed off the projecting end of the femur which pro- truded through the ham, and, bringing the wound together, succeeded in saving the limb. The Head of the Fibula has occasionally, though very rarely, been displaced by the application of direct violence. Boyer and Sanson have each recorded a case of this kind. One such case has ocemred to me in my prac- tice. It happened in a gentleman about 23 years of age, who, in descending glope covered with snow, fell with one leg bent forcibly under hun, so that he came down, as it were, in a sitting posture. The head of the fibula was thrown back off the articulating smface, and remained permanently in its new situation. The hmb was somewhat weakened, so that the patient coifid not jump, but otherwise he suffered no inconvenience. The tendon of the outer ham-string was very tense; and when I saw the case, some time after the accident, its traction effectually prevented all attempts at reduction. Dislocations of the Ankle occur in consequence of displacement of the astrao-alus from the bones of the leg, whilst it continues to preserve its normal connection with the rest of the foot. These dislocations are almost invanably connected with fracture of the lower end of the fibula, or of the imier mah leolus In fact, on looking at the arched cavity into which the astragalus is received it is evident that this bone can scarcely be displaced literally without fracture of one side of this arch. In considering these dislocations we must, in accordance with the general nomenclatm-e of similar accidents, in wine e distal part is always said to be displaced from the proximal, look upon the foot S beiilg dislocated from the leg, and not consider the tibia as being dispted unon the foot. The direction of the dislocation must consequently be dete Xed by the position into which the articular surface of the -traga - nens to be throivn. It is necessary to explain this, inasmuch as a good deal o iCity ocemn in surgical wi-itings from the same — 'leiug " rPffprpntlv accordino- to the view taken of the part displaced.

But these twists5^3 COMPOUND DISLOCATION OF ANKLE-JOINT. or sprains do not necessarily occasion dislocation, and must not be confounded Avith that accident. The dislocation Outwards is of most frequent occm-rence. The nmer mal- leolus projects forcibly against the skin. The deltoid ligament is either rup- tured, or the lower end of the inner malleolus broken off; there is a depression above the outer ankle corresponding to a fracture of the fibula ; and the sole of the foot is turned irpwards and outwards, the inner side touching the gTOund, whilst the outer edge is turned up. In the dislocation Inwards, which is a rare accident, and, aceording to Sir A. Cooper, much more dangerous than that just described, the fibula is not fractured, but the lower end of the tibia is splintered off; in an oblique mamier fr-om within outwards. The outer edge of the sole rests against the gi-omid, and the inner side is timned up. The Reduction of these lateral displacements is readily effected by simple traction on the foot, while the leg is flexed at the knee in order to relax the muscles inserted into the tendo Achillis ; leg-splints with lateral foot-pieces must then be put on, or Dupuytren’s splint may be applied on the same side as the dislocation, opposite to that on Avhich the eversion of the foot takes place. In the dislocation of the foot Backwards, the deltoid ligament is ruptm'ed, the fibula probably broken in the usual situation, and the tibia thrown forwards on the na-sicular and internal cuneiform bones ; the foot is consequently shortened, the heel rendered more projecting, and the toes pointing downwards. The dislocation Forwards, in which the foot is lengthened, and the tibia thrown upon the upper and posterior siuface of the os calcis, behind the astragalus, is an accident so rare as seldom to have been witnessed, although described. In the Treatment of these antero-posterior displacements of the ankle, traction of the foot in a proper direction, the leg being fixed and flexed upon the thigh, win readily be attended by replacement; the appheation of lateral sphuts being afterwards sufficient to keep the parts in proper position. Sometimes sub- cutaneous division of the tendo Achillis is necessary. Compound Dislocations of the Ankle-joint are serious and by no means unfrequent accidents, the displacement occiuTing in the same direction and from the same causes as the simple forms of injury. The Treatment of compoimd dislocations of the ankle-joint must depend to a considerable extent upon the amount of laceration of the soft parts, and the condition of the bones forming the arch of the joint. If the wound in the soft pai’ts be moderate in extent, clean cut, and with little bruising and injury to the bones, an attempt should be made to save the limb. This is here done by the assiduous use of antiseptics. There is no class of joint-injuries in which this method has been attended by better success than in these. The details should be carefully attended to as given at pages 201 et seq. Should antiseptics not be at hand, the case must be treated on ordinary principles, viz., by rest on a splint, the closure of the Avound, and application of ice or cold evaporating- lotions. In many instances this plan AAnll suffice, and the patient Avill recoA'er with a stiff but useful limb, the joint being only partially ankylosed. If, however, the bones be projecting and conmiinutcd, and the soft parts extensively lacerated, the question of amputation will necessarily arise. In ■ L L514 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. many cases, the operation may Ije avoided by adopting the treatment re- commended by Hey, of sawing off the malleoli, removing splinters of bone, cleaning the wound, bringing together its edges by simple dressing, and sup- porting the limb at the same time upon a M‘Intyrc’s splint. If the joint be still more seriously injured, the posterior tibial artery torn, or the foot gi’catly contused, and especially if the patient be aged and his constitution shattered, rccom’se should be had to primary amputation. I believe that the disinclina- tion on the part of Surgeons to amputate in these cases, greatly oving to the strong expression of opinion by Sir A. Cooper in favour of the attempt to save the limb, has in many cases been can-ied to such an extent as seriously to add to the patient’s danger. Secondary amputation may be rendered necessary in consequence of gangrene, erysipelas, or extensive suppuration. Dislocatioxs op the Astragalus.—The astragalus is occasioually displaced from its connection with the bones of the leg above, and with those of the tarsus below, being thrown either fonvcivcls or hciclcwciTcls. The displacement forwards happens far more frequently than that in the opposite direction. In the dislocation Forwards, the head of the bone maybe thrown either outwards or inwards; but I do not think there is any evidence to show that complete lateral dislocation of this bone can occur irrespective of displacement foiwards; the so-called lateral dislocations being displacements of the bone forwards, with twists to one or the other side. The dislocation/onmrr/s, ■with lateral inclina- tion, may either be complete or incomplete. When it is complete, the bone^ is thrown out of its bed on the calcaneinn, and separated from its comiections -with the malleolar arch above and the scaphoid in front, being forced in front of the tarsus, and lying upon the scaphoid and cimeiform bones, men the disloca- tion is incomplete, the head is sepai’ated from the scaphoid, and is thi’oviiup on it or on the external cuneiform or cuboid bones, the body of the astragalus maintaining its comiections noth the malleolar arch and os calcis._ The disloca- tion Backwards is, I beheve, always complete. In the luxation backwards there is no rotation of the bone, which is thi-own directly behind the tibia, m the space between it and the tendo Achillis. , • . ^ i.i These dislocations invariably happen from falls of the foot; more particularly when it is extended upon the leg. men the foot is m th s nnsition the lower end of the tibia either breaks off on the apphcation of si^ iient Holence, or the head of the astragalus is forced out of the cavity of the scaphoid and its bed on the os calcis; the particidar kind tho«g. i. l.a.e not couple.,.515 TREATMENT OF DISLOCATED ASTRAGALUS. L L 2 as well as forwards. In either case the displaced bone forms a, distinct tumour upon the instep, in the outline of which the form of the astragalus can be dis- tinctly made out. Over this, the skin is so tightly dra'nm as often to appear to be on the point of bursting. When the bone is thrown somewhat inwards, the foot is turned outwards, and the internal malleolus projects distinctly. When the astragalus is thrown outwards, displacement of the foot inwards, with great projection of the lower end of the fibula, takes place. In some cases, fracture of the neck of the astragalus is conjoined with these dislocations ; and not un- commonly the luxation is compoiuid from the very first, or speedily becomes so if left lumeduced, in conseqiiencc of the sloughing of the skin which covers the anterior surface of the bones, the exposed portion of which imdergoes necrosis, and perhaps eventual exfoliation. The dislocation hachivards, into the hollow under the tendo AcMUis, is rare, there being but seven recorded instances of this accident. In the majority of these there Avas displacement of the bone imvards, as well as backwards. In these cases the diagnosis is easy, as the bone forms a distinct prominence, Avhich can be felt imder the tendo Achillis, In many cases the dislocation of the astragalus is not altogether complete, a portion of the bone stiU intervening between the imder surface of the tibia and the upper surface of the os calcis. Treatment.—The reduction of the dislocation fonuards, Avhether attended by lateral displacement or not, varies greatly in facility ; in some instances being effected with the greatest possible ease, in others being attended by almost insurmoimtable difficulties. This difference depends, I think, on whether the dislocation is complete or not. When the astragalus is not completely thrown from under the arch formed by the bones of the leg, a portion of it being still entangled between their articular surfaces and that of the calcanemn, it may usually be readily reduced by relaxing the muscles of the calf, and pushing the bone back into its proper position. But when the astragalus is completely dislocated, the upper surface of the calcanemn is drawn up under the arch of the malleoh by aU the strength of the muscles that pass from the leg to be inserted into the foot. In these circumstances, in order that reduction take place, it is necessary first of all to separate the articular sm’faces to such an extent as to admit of the astragalus being pushed back into its socket : this is ahnost impossible, oiving to the great perpendicular thickness of this bone, to the extent to ivhich it is consequently necessary to draw doivn the foot, and to the httle purchase that can be obtained on it. In such cases, reduction has been greatly facilitated by the division of the tendo Achilhs, by Avhich simple operation the ivhole strain of the muscles of the calf is taken off. ^ It reduction be still impracticable, and the bone continue mueduced and irreducible on the dorsum of the foot, ivhat should be done ? Tivo com-ses present themselves to the Surgeon ; either at once to cut down upon the Mtragalus and to remoi'e it; or to adopt a palhative treatment—to put the im J at rest on a splint, to apply evaporating lotions, and to ivait the result ac mg according to circumstances as they develop themselves. In some rare cases, the displaced astragalus has given rise to comparatively little incon- the'ZrfJrf can ridom bo expected. If the dislocation have been in the direction forwards, the skm mil usually slough, and then a portion of the516 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. exposed osseous surface, which will probably necrose, may be excised, or the Avbole of the astragalus may be dissected out by freely exposing it, and severing its ligamentous attachments ; the patient recovering with a somewhat stiffened, but still useful joint. This plan appears to bo safer than excising the bone in the first mstance, so soon as the dislocation has been found to be irreducible. The operation of excising the dislocated astragalus may bo greatly facilitated by the exsanguination of the foot and leg by means of Esmarch’s elastic bandage. The tissues ai’O pale and the operation is bloodless, so that the Simgeon has full command over his knife, and can see exactly what he is cutting, and where. In luxation bacicwards, the bone has not hitherto to my knowledge been reduced, except in one case which occurred in University CoUege Hospital, and in which the tibia and fibula were also fractnred. It is by no means im- probable that subcutaneous division of the tendo Achillis may in futm-e enable the Surgeon to effect reduction. The result is, however, satisfactory, even thouo-h the bone be not reduced, the patient recovering with a useful foot. If the dislocation be left mmeduced, the soft parts covering the bone may slough, as happened in a case recorded by R. C. Williams of Diibhn, in which the bone was consecpiently extracted. ^ i In Compound Dislocation of the Astragalus (Fig. 240), the rule of practice must depend upon the extent of injiny. If the integaiments have merely been rent in consequence of the outward pressure of the displaced bone, an attempt must be made to reduce the dislocation by the aid, if necessary, of the division of the tendo Achillis ; and, if this be effected, to close the woimd Fig. 240. -Dissection of Foot in Compound Dislocation of Astragalus outwai-ds. the fet mtentioB.

So, also, if a simple dislocation of the astragalus become compound in cousecpience of the sloughing of the superjacent tense in- teguments, the exposed and necrosing bone should be removed in part or m whole, according to the circumstances of the case. If together with the dislo- cation of the astragalus, the foot be extensively crushed, amputation may be required either at the anlile-joint or at some convenient part of the leg. Dislocations op the other TiiRSAL Bones are of extremely rare occur- rence. Most of these bones, however, have been found luxated at tunes. The Calcaneum and Scaphoid, carrying with them the rest of the foot, are sometimes dislocated from the astragalus, which is left in situ under the mal- leolar arch. In these dislocations the bones may be displaced in either lateral direction—outwards or inwards. The Treatment consists in the flexion of the leg and attempts at reduction by extension of the foot in the ordinary way. If moderate extension fail in effecting reduction, Pallsel has recommended division of the tendo Achillis, and, if necessary, of the posterior tibia! tendon, as a means of facilitating this, on the same principle as in dislocation of the astragalus. The Calcaneum has been dislocated laterally from its connection with the cuboid in consequence of falls from a height, the sufferer alighting upon his heel. Chelius mentions a case in which this bone was dislocated by the effort of ch’a'Ring off a tight boot. Reduction seems to be readily effected by relaxmg the muscles, and pressing the bone back into its proper position. The Scaphoid and Cuboid Bones have been dislocated upwards, in con- sequence of a person jumping from a height and alighting upon the ball of the foot. In these instances the limb is shortened and curiously distorted, the toes pointing downwards, and the arch of the instep being increased so as to resemble closely enough the deformity of club-foot. Reduction maybe effected by drairing and pressing the parts into position. The Great Cuneiform Bone has occasionally been found to be dislocated, Sir A. Cooper mentions an instance of the kind. If reduction be not effectecl by pressing the bone into its position, no great evil appears to result to the patient, the motions of the Ihnlj not being seriously interfered with. Sometimes the tarsal joints are extensively torn open without any one bone being distinctly dislocated. I have seen this happen to a young man who caught his foot between the spokes of a revolving wheel; the foot was violently bent and twisted, and all the tarsal joints more or less torn open. Those between the scaphoid and cuneiform bones, the calcaneo-cuboid and calcaneo-astragaloid, as well as the ankle-joint itself, were especially injured, 80 as to necessitate amputation. Dislocation oe the Metatarsal Bones, though excessively rare, fr’om the manner in which these bones are locked into the tarsus, and retained by short and strong ligaments, yet occasionally occurs. Instances are recorded by Dupuytren and Smith : Liston mentions a case of luxation of the metatarsal bone of the great toe from direct violence; and Tufnell records a case of luxation downwards and backwards of the inner three metatarsal bones, fr-om a tall upon the leg by a horse roUing on its rider. Two cases have occiUTcd518 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. in my practice, in one of wiiicli, by the pressure of a “ turn-table ” on a rail- way, the outer three metatarsal bones were dislocated downwards. In the other, in consequence of a horse falling and rolling on its rider, there were a compound dislocation of the first and a simple dislocation of the fourth meta- tarsal bone. The question of amputation will always present itself in these cases, and must be determined on general principles, by the age of the patient, and the extent of injiny to the soft parts. Luxations of the Phalanges of the Toes but rarely happen, and present nothing special in nature or treatment.519 CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN. I 1 I I INJDBIES OF REGIONS. CHAPTER XXIV. INJURIES OF THE HEAD. INJURIES of the Head are among the most important subjects that can engage the Sm-geon’s attention. Their importance is derived not so much from the mere iujmy of the scalp and skull, as from the implication of the brain and its membranes, and the results which are thereby produced, in many cases dh’ectly, and in others indirectly and remotely, owing to the anatomical connections and consequent close pathological sympathies that subsist between the external and internal structimes of the head. In consequence of this tendency to cerebral complication, it is of the fii’st moment in practice to study these injuries as a whole, -with special regard to the affections of the encephalon that are produced by them, and from which the injiuy of the scalp and the fracture of the skuU derive the greater part of their interest. It is there- fore necessary, in the first instance, to be acquainted ivith the natime and treatment of the principal forms of cerebral affection that supervene upon these accidents, before we proceed to study the nature and treatment of the injmies themselves. CEREBRAL COMPLICATIONS OP INJURIES OF THE HEAD. These may be primary or secondary. The brain is subject to thi’ee principal Primary States of Functional Disturbance arising fr’om injury; viz., 1. Concussion, 2. Compression, and 3. Cerebral Irritation. Any one of these may be followed by, or be complicated with, inflammatory actions of various kinds, that derive much qf their peculiar characteristics frum the conditions ■with which they are associated, and fr’om the injuries by which they are occasioned. In describing these different conditions, we are compelled to define the symptoms that characterise them more distinctly than is the case in actual practice, where they are not so closely individualised, and become merged together to a considerable extent. 1. Concussion op the Brain,—Concussion, or stinniing, appears to be a shoek communicated to the head fr-om the application of such external violence as will produce commotion of the substance of the brain, or interfere with the circulation through it; in consequence of which its functions become suspended, usually in a slight and transitory dcgTee, but occasionally to such an extent that the patient does not rally for many hours520 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. from tlic depressed state into ■which he is thro'wn, and perhaps sinks without recoYery. The Pathology of concussion of tlie brain is very ol^scurc. The roasoir of this is obvious ;—tcAV people die from simple concussion. In those cases in which death has occun-ed from other causes during a state of cerebral concussion, it has been found that the disturbance of the functions of the brain constituting concussion has been due to actual lesion of its substance. In some cases, the vessels of the brain and its membranes have been congested. In others, again, portions of the cerebral substance, varying in size fr-om points to patches an inch or more in diameter, have been disintegrated and more or less ecchymosed. In the more severe and fatal cases of concussion of the brain, the cerebral substance is ecchymosed in a punctiform manner or dis- organised to a great extent; in fact, in these cases the characteristic signs of contusion of the brain become apparent. The Signs of concussion vary according to the severity of the injmy to the brain. In the slighter cases, the patient may merely feel giddy and confused for a few minutes. In others, consciousness is not affected, but the patient feels faint and weak, and is unable to stand. In the more severe forms in that degree, indeed, which usually accompanies any severe nijin-y of the head— the sin’face of the body becomes cold and pale ; the sufferer is motionless and insensible, or only answers when spoken to in a loud ^oice, relapsing again into speedy uisensibility, or rather semi-consciousness; the pulse is feeble, the pupils are usually conti’acted, but may be dilated, and generally respond to the action of light, and the sphincters are usually relaxed ; the limbs are flaccid, and muscular power is impaired or lost. After this condition, which is the flrst stage of concussion, has lasted for a few minutes or hours, according to the severity of the shock, the second stage comes on ; the circidation gi-adually re- establishing itself, the pulse becoming fuller, and the surface warmer. _ About this time the patient very commonly vomits; the straining accompanpng this effort appears to be of sei-snce in stimulating the heart’s action, and drmng t e blood with more vigoin- to the bram, thus tending to restore its functions ; and we accorduigly find that, after vomiting, the sufferer quickly ralhes. In the more severe cases, the symptoms that have just been described are so strong y marked that the patient appears to be moribund ; there is complete prostration of aU nervous and physical power ; the surface being cold and death-hke, the eyes glassy, the pupils either contracted or widely dilated, the pidse scaicely perceptible and intemittent. In this state the_ patient may he recovery being slow, and the concussion merging into some othei and pei n,ore sLiouskffeckn of the nervous centres ; ; speedily teiminating in death, apparently by failure of the heait s action. &it if may\mly be said, that eveiy case of concussion in which unconsciousinss, thoiiji but momentary, has been produced, is a most serious one. ^ y m- mote evil consequence in the form of secondaiy ensue, if once the brain-substance tavebeen so severely shakm M t patient unconscious, even though the insensibility hwt but a Lich cases require to be closely w.atched and caretnlly managed loi months after the injury. The Terminations ot concussion arc Aaiious. ^YQ have already scon that521 C0^IPRESSI02^ OF THE BRAIH. in some eases this affection may speedily give way to complete lecove y , althonoh slight headache, some degree of giddiness, confusion of thonght, and inaptitude for mental ocenpatioii, may last for a few days before the mental powers are completely re-established. In other cases, the concussion may rapidly tcmiinate in death ; but between these conditions there are several in- termediate states. Thus, recovery may be complete, but a permanently iiTitable state of brain may be left; the patient, though capable of the ordinary duties oflife, becoming readily excited by slight excesses hi diet or in the use ol stimulants, or by mental emotion, though not of an inordinate intensity, in- dividuals thus affected, suffering from a preternatimally irritable brain, frequently die suddenly in the coimse of a few months, or a year or two, after the receipt of the injury. _ 1 i i j.- j. In other cases the recovery continues to be incomplete; although the patient may be enabled to follow his usual occupation, and to mix in the ordinary business of life, yet his state is precarious, the brain being liable to the occur- rence of inflammatory disease on the slightest exciting cause. In such cases as these, there is fr’eqiiently a certain degree of impairment of mental power, the memory failing either generally or in certain important pouits, as ^ Tvdth reference to dates, persons, places, or language. The speech is perhaps indis- tinct and stuttering. Impairment of vision is a very common consequence of these injuries. Asthenopia, with perhaps squinting or paralysis of the eyelid, may be left. The hearing may be impaired, or noises of various kinds set up in the ears. Epileptifoim convulsions occasionally occur ; sometimes, as the patient is recovering his consciousness, he may be seized vdth a severe fit; but more commonly the convulsions do not come on as a primary con- sequence, but rather as a remote secondary result of the brain-injiuy. There may be diminution or loss of muscular and of virile power, especially, as Hennen observes, when the injury has been inflicted upon the back of the head ; and Holberton has noticed that, when the medulla oblongata has been injured, the pulse may continue pretematuraUy slow—an obseiwation which I have had several opportunities of confliming in injuries both of the medulla, the pons Yarolii, and the crura cerebri. For these symptoms to occim, it is by no means necessary that the original local injury should have been severe. In some cases, the whole nervous system appears to be jarred and concussed without any wound or apparent sign of external injury to the head. At first, the symptoms of concussion are but slight, perhaps even none are apparent, and the sufferer congi’atulates himself on his escape ; but gi-adually impair- ment of nervous power, manifesting itself in one or other of the ways just mentioned, comes on, and the health continues broken through life. In other cases, again, the symptoms of concussion may gradually terminate in those of compression ; and not unfrequently the reaction that comes on, passing beyond the bounds that are necessary for the re-establishment of the healthy functions of the l)rain, terminates in inflammation. Hippocrates has truly observed, that no injury of the head is too trivial to be despised, or too serious to be despaired of. "2. CoiPiiESSiox OF THE Beain.—This is a common condition in injuries of the ^ head, arising from a gveat variety of causes from the pressime of a portion of Ijone, of blood extravasated, or of pus formed within the skull, orINJURIES OF THE HEAD. 522 from a foroigu body lodged there. In -whateYer way occasioned, however, the symptoms, although presenting some difiercnces, are tolerably constant, The patient lies in a state of coma, stupor or lethargy, being paralysed more or less completely, heavy and drowsy, or insensible, not answering when spoken to, ox- only Avhen addressed in a loud voice, and perhaps shaken at the same time. The breathing is carried on slowly and deeply, with a stertorous or snoring noise, and ixsually a peculiar blowing of the lips. The stertor appears to be owing to paralysis of the velum pendulum palati, which, hanging down as an inanimate curtain, is throAvn into vibrations dm-iixg expiration by the passage of the air across it; the distension of the cheeks and blowing of the lips are due to the muscidar paralysis of these pai’ts. One or both pupils are dilated ; the pulse is full, often slow, the feces pass involuntarily from paralysis of the sphincter ani, and the urine is not uncommonly retained from paralysis of the bladder; the skin may be cool, but in many cases, on the contrary, is rather hot and pei-haps perspiring ; the temperatm-e may rise to 100° F. Not unfreqixently this condition of stupor alternates with paroxysms ot de- lirium, or of local convulsive action. This state of coma may become compli- cated by symptoms of inflammation ; and, unless the cause that produces the compi’ession be i-emoved, it usually tei-minates speedily in death, the patient gradually sinkuxg into more complete unconsciousness, and dying in an . apoplectic condition. In other, but much rarer cases, the coma may continue ahnost an indeflnite time, for many weeks or even months, ixntil the compress- ing cause is removed, when the patient may recover consciousness, and the symptoms suddenly disappear. ^ i • The Diagnosis between concussion and compression has been suificiently in- dicated in the preceding description not to require special mention here. But it must be remembered that, in many cases, one state merges into the other, so that the symptoms are not so distinctly marked as has been indicated ; and they are more especially obsciu-ed when associated with inflammation. 3. Cerebral Iixritation.—The third form of primary cerebral distinbauce which is met wdth in injinies of the head, differs very remarkably from both the preceding. The patient presents symptoms neither of concussion nor of compression, nor is there any combination of the phenomena characteris- ing these two states ; but the symptoms are altogether pecuhar. For con- venience of description, they may be divided into two groups, the lotUy and the mental. . _ „ j.- The Bodily Symptoms are as follows. The attitude of the patient is peculiar and most characteristic he lies on the side, and is cinled up in a Lte of general fiexion. The body is bent forwards, the knees ““ dmm up on the abdomen, the legs bent, the arms flexed, and ^ ^ He does not lie motionless, but is restless, and often, nhen nutated, tossffi^ Mmstrabont. But, however restless he may be, he stre^ « out nor assumes the supine position, but invariably let cits to the attitad Jflerion The eyelids are firmly closed, and he resists violently meiy Irt m^e to open themi if this be eflected, to be contracted. The sinface is pale anc coo , or ex en • heat of head. The pulse is small, feeble, and sphincters are not usually affected, and the patient mil l-EFFECT ON THE MENTAL POWERS. 52: the bladder requires to be emptied; there may, however, though rarely, be retention. The Mental state is equally peculiar. In-itability of mind ]S the prevail- ing characteristic. The patient is unconscious, takes no heed of what passes,^ uiiless called to in a loud tone of voice, when he shows signs of instability of temper or frowns, turns away hastily, mutters indistinctly, and grinds his teeth. It appears as if the temper, as much as or more than the intellect, were affected in this condition. He sleeps without stertor. The course taken by these symptoms is as follows. After a period varying fr-om one week to three, the pulse improves in tone, the tempcratui-e of the body increases, the tendency to flexion subsides, and the patient lies stretched out. The mental state also changes. Irritabihty gives way to fatuity ; there is less manifestation of temper, but more of weakness of mind. Eecovery is slow, but, though delayed, may at length be perfect; although in these, as in all other cases of cerebral disturbance, ulterior consequences may be manifested. This form of cerebral disturbance may, fr'om the peculiar irritability that characterises it, be with propriety termed cerebral irritation. The symptoms that have just been described usually follow blows upon the temple or forehead, and probably in many cases may arise from, or are associated with, lacerations of the cerebral substance, more especially of the grey matter. Contusion of the Beain.—The substance of the brain may be contused or lacerated by blows upon the head. This is most common at or under the seat of ill] my, or it may occur as the result of contrecoiip, at an opposite point in the same, or even in the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Being struck on the right side of the head, the patient may suffer from contusion of the opposite part of the left hemisphere, or vice versd, or a blow on the occiput may occasion laceration of the anterior part of both lateral lobes. In this injury of the cerebral substance, we have many of the symptoms that are characteristic of cerebral imtation ; but in addition to them there is occasionally more or less coma, in consequence of extravasation of blood, or there may be paralysis, facial or hemiplegic. In other circumstances, or possibly associated with these con- ditions, there may be convulsive movements more or less epileptiform in character. These may be confined to the face, may extend to the paralysed limbs, or may occupy both sides of the body. The Prognosis in these cases is serious, but by no means necessarily fatal. In fact, in the majority of instances, recovery ensues. Effects of Cerebral Injury on the Mental Powers.^—The mental con- dition of patients who arc recoi'cring or who are supposed to have recovered from head-injury, is one that deserves attentive consideration. It will fre- quently be found that the mental powers ai’e weakened, cither generally or in one special direction. The memory may be impaired for Avords, persons, or dates. The mind cannot grasp a subject or carry out a continuous train of thought, aud is incapable of fixed attention or reasoning. Delusions of A'arious kinds may occm, especially in connexion Avith the mode of occurrence of the accident. I have knoAvn a patient to give the most consistent and detailed accounts of the mode in Avhich his head Avas injured, varying them from day524 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. to day ; and cveiy one being false, but believed in by the patient at the time. The patient could be led, by a process of questioning and suggestions combined, to give almost any version that the intciTogator desired ; and this with great circumstantiality of detail. This is a matter of much interest and importance in a medico-legal aspect, as it is evident that an individual Avho has sustained a sc^'crc injury of the head might, in perfect good faith, give an entirely false account of the mode of infliction of the injury, by which an innocent person might be seriously compromised. The Secondary Consequences of injury to the brain consist of, 1, Inflam- mation ; and 2, the Deposit of Pus and other iirfiammatory exudations upon or within that organ and its membranes. 1. Teaumatic Encephalitis.—Inflammation of the brain and its mem- branes from injury {Traumatic Encephalitis) is an affection of gveat frequency and of corresponding importance. It is specially apt to superv-ene on all inju- ries of the head ; though the liability to it necessarily increases ivith the seve- rity of the accident. This inflammation of the brain and its membranes may set in with great intensity, the symptoms of phrenitis being strongly mai-ked ; in other instances, it gradually creeps on in a slow and insidious manner, not attracting attention until it has given rise to some severe and ulterior conse- quences, as effusion or suppuration, Avhen its symptoms become so mixed up with those of compression and of iiritation, as to make the exact diagnosis of the patient’s condition far from easy. The period at which symptoms of in- flammation of the brain may manifest themseh'es, after an injury of the head, varies greatly. In some instances they set m almost immediately the patient has recovered from the effects of the concussion ; the reaction from this state gradually assuming an inflammatory character. In other cases, it is not imtil after several days that inflammation declares itself; and, again, it sometimes happens that the inflammatory affection does not supervene for weeks or months : but then, occiuring perhaps mider the influence of comparatively triA’ial causes, it may destroy the patient. Pathological Changes.—After death, we usually find both the brain and its membranes inflamed. The arachnoid is, how^ei'er, the structine that appeals principally to suffer, being thickened, so as to become milky and semi-opaque. Adherent lymph of a greenish-yellow colour and opaque -purulent appearance, covers one or both hemispheres of the brain, being deposited in largest quantity at the seat of the injiuy, and not imfr-equently extending across and into its fissmes, occupying especially the depressions about its base. The vascii aiity of the brain and its membranes is greatly increased ; the arachnoid being red- dened in patches, and the vessels of the pia mater becoming tingid and very numerous, forming a Avascular network over the sinface of the ram. ^ e sinuses also are distended AAnth blood ; the cerebral substance exhibits an in- crease in the number of red points, so as often to present a somewhat rosy hue; and the A-entricles are filled AAdth reddish semi-tiirbid serum, a large T^^u^tfly of Avhich is effused about the base of the brain. In some of the mme adA ance cases, inflammatory softening of the cerebral substance may occiii. Symptoms.—In considering the symptoms of traumatic encephalitis, useless to cndeavoiu’ to make a distinction between t e m amma loi brain and that of its membranes ; the tAVO structiu’cs being a aa ays morACUTE AND SUBACUTE ENCEPHALITIS. 525 implicated at the same time. The most practical dhision of this disease fol- lowing- injury, is into the acute and the chronic or snlacute encephalitis. Acute Encephalitis usually comes on within eight-and-forty lioiu’S of the I infliction of the injury. The patient complains of severe, constant, and in- i creasing pain in his head ; the scalp is hot, the carotids beat forcibly, the pupils are contracted, the eyes intolerant of light, and the ears of noise ; the pulse is full, A-ibrating, and bounding ; and wakefulness, with delirium, usually of a , A-iolent character, speedily comes on. All the symptoms of severe constitutional 1 pyrexia set in at the same time. Under active and proper treatment, this condition may gradually subside until the health is re-established, but more commonly the symptoms of inflam- mation merge into those of compression : the delirimn becoming replaced partly or entirely by stupor, from which the patient is roused with difficulty, the pupils gradually dilating, the breathing becoming heavy and stertorous, the pulse sometimes continuing with its former rapidity, at others beeoming slow and ojjpressed. The skin is hot but clammy ; the patient falls into a heavy, dull, unconscious state, ivhich alternates with commlsive twitchings or jerkings, and occasional delirious outbreaks. As death approaches, the sphincters become relaxed, the pulse more feeble, the sm-face cooler, and the coma more intense and continuous, until the patient sinks from exhaustion and compression con- joined. In cases of this kind, pus may be found upon the surface or within the substance of the brain, in one case being diffused, in the other collected into a more or less distinctly circumscribed abscess. In other cases, again, the symp- toms of compression appear to be induced by a thick layer of lymph lying upon the siu’face of the brain, or by a quantity of serous fluid being poured out into the ventricles and about the base. Chronic or Subacute Encephalitis is the most interesting and important variety of inflammation following injimies of the head. It may come on a foAv days after the infliction of the injury, or not until months have elapsed. It may arise fr-om accidents that simply impheate the skull, as weU as from those that directly affect the brain and its membranes. The patient in many cases has apparently recovered entirely from the accident, though in others it will be found that some one symptom indicative of the brooding mischief still con- tinues, such as headache, or impairment of sight or of hearing. Occasionally, the comijig mischief is foreshadowed by unusual irritability of temper, by loss of mental vigom-, or by some other functional distimbance of the brain. In such cases, the subacute encephalitis may suddenly come on, ushered in per- haps by .an aggravation of the persistent symptom, or by an epileptic fit. In other cases, the symptoms set in suddenly without any w^arning, but usually Avith much intensity, and speedily prove fatal. The Symptoms of subacute encephalitis, Avhen it has fairly set in, consist of those of inflammation, irritation, and compression of the brain con joined ; in some cases one, in other instances another, of the conditions appearing to pre- dominate. The in-itation and inflammation proceed from the increased A'ascular setion ; the compression from the effusion of serous fluid, or pus, or of lymph. The symptoms consist of pain in the head Avith heat of the scalp, and either dilatation or contraction of the pupils, occasionally one being dilated and the other contracted. Squinting, intolerance of light, delirium, moanino- orINJURIES OF THE HEAD. 526 screaming, micoiisciousncss, with convulsive twitchings of the limbs and face, commonly occur mth the ordinary symptomatic fever ; and lastly, symptoms of coma, rapidly terminating in death. In the subacute encephalitis, the same appearances are v’ery generally found after death, as in the more acute form of the alfection ; but commonly the arachnoid membrane is principally affected. So constantly is this the case, that some Surgeons have proposed, and not altogether Avith injustice, to apply the term arachnilis to this form of traumatic encephalitis, looking upon the inflammation of the arachnoid as the principal lesion. 2, Intracranial Suppuration.—This may be of three distinct kinds:— a. Suberanial ; h. Intrameningeal; c. Cerebral. a. The Suhcranial form consists in the deposit of pus betiA'een the skull and the dura mater. It ahvays occurs at the point struck, and is hmited or circumscribed. It is nei'er the result of contrecoup. Three conditions may lead to this variety of intracranial su]ipiu’ation. a. A blow on the head which, Avith or without wound of the scalp or fracture of the skull, causes a separation of the dura mater from the bone, leaving a cavity in which inflammatory effusions and eventually pus collect. |3. A bloAV on the head causing necrosis of the bone, either by simple severe contusion, or by detaching it from the dura mater and stripping off the peri- cranium—thus distm-bing its vascular connections, and so giving rise to sup- puration imder the injured portion of bone. y. The irritation of splinters of the inner table in cases of ordinary depressed or of punctured fractines of the skull, causing chronic inflammation of the dina mater and eventual suppuration. In these cases it is often foimd associated Avith one or both of the next varieties. &. The Intrameningeal form consists in the accumulation of pus, or of greenish puriform lymph, in the caAuty of the arachnoid, or in its deposit L the pia mater. It is usually widely diffused, most generally beneath the part struck ; but sometimes on the opposite side of the head, always more towards the v’ertex than in any other part. It commonly occins in persons of low Autahty—in jiysemic cases—and is associated Avith typhoid symptoms, _ _ . c. The Cerebral form is usually met Avith as a distinct circumscribed abscess in the white substance of the hemispheres, often associated Avith the last variety, and occim-ing in individuals of Ioav or unhealthy habit of body. It may occin 1. At the seat of injiny ; 2. By contrccoup;^ or, 3. It may be the consequence of the lodgment of foreign bodies in the brain. The formation of pus Avithin the skuU is a sequela of much interest in injinies of the head ; and an endeavour has been made, especiaUy by Pott, to lay doAvn rules by which its occiuTence may be accurately detennined. ^ Thus it has been said that if, dining the continuance of encephalitis, fits of shivenng come on, followed by the gradual supervention of coma, Avhich sloAvly becomes more and more complete, whilst the constitutional symptoms of inflammation do not subside ; and if, at the same time, a puffy sAvelhiig form upon the iiniiijined scalp, or the Avoiind, if there be one, become pale and cease to discharge, the pericraiiiiun separating fr’om the bone, which is seen to be yellowish broAVii and diy, an abscess will have formed imder the skull; aiicPY.EMIA IN INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 527 further, that in all probability its seat will correspond to these changes m the scalp and licricraninm, which are due to the bone having lost its vitality by being separated from the dura mater by the subjacent abscess. In many cases, doubtless, this progi-ession of constitutional symptoms, I accompanied by the two local signs just mentioned, has attbrded proof of the existence of intracranial suppuration. It but seldom happens, however, that i the signs attending the formation of pus mthiii the skidl occim in the distinct order and Avith the degree of precision above stated. In the great majority of i cases, the Surgeon can only suspect the presence of pus from the symptoms of inflanmiation terminating in paralysis or coma. But he cannot say with certainty that pus has formed, for the coma may arise from the pressure of other effusions : but if the pufly swelling of the scalp or the separation of the pericranium occur, Avith exposure of dry and yelloAV bone, Avith hemiplegia on the opposite side, then he may feel himself justified in giving a more positive opinion as to its existence in some situation Anthin the cranial cavity, probably beneath or in the immediate neighbourhood of the part thus affected. Pyemia, vrith its characteristic visceral secondary abscesses, is by no means an unfrequent complication of injuries of the head. It may occur as a conse- quence of any lesion of the scalp, skull, or brain, in which the patient survives sufficiently long for the develojiment of the characteristic phenomena of this disease. Hence it is chiefly after the slighter forms of cerebral injury that pyaemia and secondary abscesses haA^e been met with ; occasionally after woimds of the scalp, rarely after those of the brain or its membranes, but more commonly and not unfi’equently after injiuy of the skidl, more esj)ecially after severe contusion of the bone Avithout fracture. The sequence of pathological phenomena in these cases is the same that is observed in all in Avhich pyaemia foUoAVS injury or wound of the osseous struc- tures. The part of the bone that is struck usually necroses ; inflammation and suppuration are set up in the siuTounding portions of the skull; the cancelli of the diploe become filled Avith pus ; its A-ems, which are large and sinuous, inflame, and become the media of transmitting septic material to the general cir- culation ; the ordinary constitutional symptoms of pyiemia develop themselves, and secondaiy abscesses eventually form in the lungs, liver, and joints, with lowly organised plastic effusions into the serous cavities, more particidarly those of the pleura and pericardimn. The older AATiters on Siu'gery had noted and had maiwelled at the strange phenomena of hepatic abscess folloAving slight head- injuries, and had generally overlooked the occurrence of secondary deposits in other organs and stnictm'es. More modem iiiA'estigation has shoAvn that these abscesses are pyrnmic, that they are a part of a general piu’ulent infection of the system, and that they almost invariably are aecompanied by pulmonaiy abscesses : indeed, it is these and not the hepatic that are the common conse- quences of pyaemia resulting from cerebral injury. Of eighteen cases, P. HeAA'ett found the lungs studded AAith abscesses in thirteen, and the lii’er in three • and of those three, in one case only was the liver alone affected. It has been supposed by some that intracranial siqipuration is a necessary iirecursor of these secondaiy abscesses : that it frequently co-exists is undoubted—avc often meet with pus in these cases betAveen the dura mater and the contused bone • but to suppose that it is a necessary concomitant, is an eiTor. I have seenINJURIES OF THE HEAD. 528 ■cases in the most extensive secondary deposits were Ibund in the lungs, liver, joints, &c., hut in which not a drop of pus existed in the interior of the skull in any pai-t; hut I have never seen a case in Avhich the diploe around the injured hone did not contain pus, sometimes diffused through its cells, sometimes filling its venous sinuses. When intracranial suppuration co-exists wth secondary pyaemic deposits, the symptoms of the two conditions hccome so mixed up as to lead to con- siderahlc difficulty in diagnosis ; hut when the intracranial suppuration is not established, there may he a complete absence of all cerebral distiu-hance, whilst the alternating rigors and heat of pyaemia, the oppressed breathing, or the kepatic tenderness, with hiccup or reem-ring sickness, and the articular tenderness, give unmistakable evidence of the formation of secondary TIiId SCG SS0 S • The prognosis of these cases is necessarily most unfavomablc. I doubt much whether recovery is possible when once pyeemia, consequent on head- injury has advanced to the formation of secondary visceral abscesses. _ Treatment.—The treatment of these various cerebral injimies, and of their concomitant affections, is one of the most important and difficult subjects that can arrest the Sm-geon’s attention ; the difficulty depending m a gveat measm-e on the various conditions that have just been described not occiuTmg-m prac- tice with that amomit of distinctness and particulaiaty by which their chai-acters can alone be conveyed in description, but being associated together m sue a wav that the exact state of the patient caimot so readily be made out. Ihere are few cases, indeed, in which practical tact and a nice discrimination and analysis of symptoms are more required than in those now under consideiation. It wmld hoover, be useless to attempt to describe the shades and modifica- Iffir^treatment^ in the management of the different gTO^ ffiese various forms of traumatic cerebral distimbance. ^ e must, therefoie ctitent ourselves with describing the treatment of each state ^ sepaa’ately, and leave the consideration of the varieties that commonly present themselves in practice to the discretion of the Sin-geon. • f Ill the Treatment of Concussion, the fii’st gveat indication is to ic- estlu* the Vested energies of the circulation f “r Thi T iVppt^iio-this we must be careful not to overstimulate the patient.

Venesection used formerly to be extensively practised as a precautionary measine, in order to prevent undue reaction and inflammatory mischief following on head-injuries. Perhaps our inedecessors eiTcd in the too frequent and liberal use of the lancet in these cases—I beheve that Sm-geous of the present day are too sparing in its use. In the yomig and robust the best possible effects follow venesection in head-mjuries, to the extent of from 12 to 16 ounces. In children, leeches advantageously take the place of the lancet. The patient should be freely purged, kept on a low diet, and, above all, should remain quiet in bed for some days. Should impaiiTuent of the mental faculties or senses be left, the more pru- dent plan -will be to have recourse to a mild antiphlogistic treatment, con- sisting of leeching, cupi^ing, blistering, the introduction of a seton in the nape of the neck, pinging, and more especially a mild mercurial course, with strict avoidance of all mental and bodily stimulation. The patient must be carefully watched, and kept under proper supervision for some length of time, as serious sjTnptoms ai’e apt suddenly to declare themselves. IVhen Acute Inflammation, of the Brain or its Membranes has come on, at whatever period after the injury, active treatment should be at once adopted. The head must be shaved, and an ice-bladder kept constantly apphed. Bleeding from the arm, repeated as often as the pulse rises, as well as by cupping, or leeches, should be had recourse to ; the bowels should be freely opened, and rigid abstinence must be enjoined, the patient at the same time being confined to a quiet and darkened room, and removed from all causes of excitement of the special senses. Calomel should then be ad- ministered, so as speedily to affect the mouth. As the disease assumes a chi-onic form, the same general plan of treatment, modified according to the intensity of the inflammatory affection, must be persevered in, the patient being’ kept for a length of time after the subsidence of all the symptoms in a state of complete quietude. The Subacute Encephalitis which occasionally follows injinies of the head, eien at a remote period from their infliction, is most dangerous and unmanageable, being very apt to terminate in loss or impairment of the senses, m diminution of intellectual power, or in local paralysis. Much of the diffi- culty in its treatment appears to arise from the fact that the inflammation is often of a low asthenic type, consequently not admitting active depletory measures. •' In this disorder the best results are obtained by the proper administration ot mercury and the employment of counter-in-itants. The best mode of ad ministering the mercury is-to give half a grain or a grain of calomel every four or SIX houi-s until the gums are affected, and to keep up the effect by dimmishuig- but not leaying off the drug. The repeated application of blistci’s over the shaven scalp is perhaps the most useful form of counter-irritation • to w ich, in more chronic cases, a seton in the neck may be added.

In the early stage, the treatment tliat I liave found most sncccssthl is of a negative character, and consists in tlie avoidance of all active measures. No good, but much harm, may result Irom bleeding, purg- ing, and mercurialising the patient. Complete rest, the removal of all mental and sensual excitement, shaving the head, the application of ice, a mild aperient or an occasional enema, are all that can he done in the way of medical treat- ment. As the constitutional powers are depressed, they must not he too much lowered by complete abstinence from food, and small quantities of stimulants may usually be advantageously given. A tea-s]30onful of brandy in a little water, or beef-tea, every hour or two, according to the condition of the pulse and the temperatiu’c of the skin, will generally be required. In some cases, where there is great restlessness, and some delirium, without any sign of encephalitis having supervened, chloral will be found of great value, or an opiate even may be given to quiet the patient and induce sleep. This cerebral irritation is the only form of primary cerebral distmbance in Avhich I have seen opiates act beneficially ; but their administration requires great care, and must not be ventmed on if there be any elevation of temperatme or quickness of pulse. After a time these signs of depression give way to those of subacute meningitis, the patient becomes noisy, shouting and crying, restless and sleepless. At this period, and in such circumstances, venesection may be practised with great advantage. The bleeding should be followed up by the administration of bromide of potassimn or of chloral, and idtimately by the more special treatment of meningeal irritation. In all cases of Coma from Compression, the pressure must be relieved before it can be expected that the coma will subside. But, besides this great and obvious indication, which must be carried out in diflerent ways according to the nature of the compressing cause, there are certain general considerations to be attended to, by which the patient’s condition may be much relieved. Thus the bowels should be freely opened by placing a drop of croton-oil, mixed with a little mucilage, in the patient’s mouth, or by the use of oleaghaous or terebinthinate enemata. The lu'ine is to be drawn off t^vice in the twenty- fom- hours, the room darkened and kept quiet, and ice or an evaporating lotion applied to the head. When symptoms of compression occur as the result of inflciMMdtion inside, the skull, the treatment becomes surrounded by difficulties. If, notwithstand- ing that antiphlogistic measures have been pushed to their full extent, rigors occur and coma supervene, conjoined with a certain amount of con- tinuous inflammatory action, the question will always arise as to whether tre- phining should be had recoinse to on the supposition of matter having formedt In these cases two great difficidties present themselves ; the first has reference to the existence of pus vdthiu the skull, and the second to its situation. The question as to the actual existence of Pus within the SkuU. and to the dependence of the symptoms of coma upon the compression exercised by the purulent deposit, is always a difficult one to decide. There arc, as has already been stated, no absolute and unequivocal symptoms indicative ot the formation of pus within the skull; symptoms closely simulating t lose tia accompany its presence being often produced by the cffiision ot seium, oi o531 SIGiYS OF Firs WITHIN THE SKULL. pnriform Ijmpli, on tlie brain or its membranes. ]3ut althongli there may not be any symptom that unequiTOcally indieates the formation of pus in tliis situation, the Surgeon is not unfi-equently enabled, by tlie assemblage of general symptoms and local signs, to indicate its existence with considerable acciu-acy. In these cases, however, it is usually imppssible to detennine the exact scat of the purulent deposit with sufficient precision to admit of its evacuation Ijy the trephine—whether the pus be between the skull and the dura mater, between the layers of the arachnoid, underneath this membrane, between the cerebral com'olutions, or deeply seated in the substance of the brain ; whether it be situated under the seat of injury and be. there cfocimi- scribed, or so extensively diffused as not to be capable of complete evacuation. That these difficulties are real, must be ob'vious to e^•cry practical Sm-geon ; and in illustration T may mention the following two cases, out of many that I have untnessed. A man was admitted into University College Hospital with an extensi^'c lacerated wound of the scalp, denuding the pericranium. He continued free from aU cerebral disturbance until the tenth day after the accident, when he comijlained of headache, and had a quick pulse and a hot skin. At this time it was observed that the denuded pericranium had separated from the skull. He was treated by active antiphlogistic means, the symptoms subsiding, and went on favourably until the thirty-fourth day, when he suddenly became delirious and unconscious, though easily roused when spoken to loudly, and then answering rationally ; his pulse fell to 48. He died on the thirty-ninth day, comatose. On examination after death, the pericranium was found detached at the seat of injmy ; under this the dma mater was thick, yellow, and opaque, but no pus was observable. On separating the hemis- pheres, however, a large abscess was found situated deeply in the anterior lobe •on the injured side, and protruding into the median fissme. It contained about one ounce of pus. In such a case as this trephining' would evidently have been useless ; ' for, although it was probable that there was pus within the skidl, yet its seat could not have been diagnosed, and the abscess could never have been reached. Another case that was admitted into the Hospital, was that of a man who had received a large lacerated wound on the left side of the scalp in consequence of a fall. There was no injury to the bone, and the patient Avent on perfectly Avell until the seventy-seventh day, the wound haAnng cicatrised. He was then suddenly seized with hemiplegia of the right side, from which he recovered partially on being bled ; some tmtehing of the muscles, hoAveA'er, continued. n the ninety-ninth day after the accident he became comatose, and was trephined by S. Cooper, but Avithout relief; dying Avith symptoms of com- pression of the brain on the third day after the operation. On examination lick yelloAV lymph Avas found, coA-ering the AAffiole of the upper surface of both hemispheres, lying between the arachnoid and pia mater, and extendiiio- i„to the sulci betAveen the com-olutions. There was an abscess in the substance of e bram on the surface of the right hemisphere, on the side opposite to the a 0 injury. Here_ also, though the symptoms Averc well marked, and the c.,Tiosis as to the existence of pus correct, trephining Avas useless as the cou d not be evacuated. These cases serve to indicate the difficulties that M H 2INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 53^ suiTound any operation with the view of OA^acnating matter ft-om within tlic- craninni. When, however, the symptoms of inflammation have been inteiTupted by an attack of rigors followed by coma, or accompanied by hemi]olegic paralysis on the side opposite to the seat of injury, with the formation of a puffy swelling of the scalp, or by the separation of the pericranium aud the exposure of yellow and diy bone at the bottom of the wound, there can be little doubt that the Surgeon, though bearing in mind the extreme uncertainty of the case, might be justified in trephining at the seat of local change or of injury, in the hope of finding and evacuating pus deposited beneath the skull, and thus giving the patient his only chance of life. Aud indeed, if the local changes just described be well marked, the bone being dry, having lost its vitality, aud not bleeding from the diploe when cut, the probability of finding pus im- mediately beneath the trephine aperture, and seeing it Avell up by the side of the instrument as the bone is perforated, is very great. And should it not be met with there, and the dima mater appear bulging, and without pulsation for the absence of the ordmary pulsatile movement of the brain is an important diagmostic sign in these cases, indicating abscess either under the diu’a matei or in the brain-substance—an incision might even be made through this membrane, in the hope that, the abscess being circumscribed, the escape of the pus might be facilitated. Should this attempt fail, there are few Surgeons whO’ would have the hardihood to follow the example of Dupuytreu, who plunged a bistoury into the substance of the brain, aud thus luckily relieved the patient of an abscess in this situation. Yet, even though pus be actually found uudei the skull, between it and the dura mater, and be evacuated, I fear that the patient’s chances of recovery Avill not be very materially increased, as the en- cephalitis win continue, and eventually lead to bis death. In my own ex- perience, I have never met with a case of recovery in these circumstances ; and P. Heivett states that the successful termination of a case of trephining tor mis within the skull, even between it and the dima mater, is all but unknown to Surgeons of the present day. Yet, in the face of this unfavomable prospect, it appears to me that trephining is the proper course to pimsiie. There can be no doubt fi-om the records of simgery, that patients have occasionally recovered Avho have been trephined for intracranial suppuration ; and, as the pus caimot evacuate itself, it is perfectly certain that death must ensue if it be not let out As the only chance of life, therefore, is in the use of the trejifriie, it appea s to me to L proper to have recourse to this, however doubtful may be the '“ra; Treatment of Pyemia from iujory of tbe skull must be oonducted on those ordinary medical ™ ‘^tTa mr* sur- pyrnmia, from whatever cause arising.

INJURIES OP THE SCALP. COXTUSIOXS OP THE ScAEP from blows are of common occiuTence, and present some peculiarities. However severe the contusion may be, it seldom happens that the scalp sloughs. This is evidently owing to the great vascu- larity and consequent active vitality of the integuments of the head. In many cases, a contusion in this situation is followed by considerable extravasation ot blood, raising up the scalp into a soft semi-fluctuating tumom’. It occasionally happens, especially in bloivs on the heads of children, that this extravasation gives rise to the siqiposition that fracture exists, owing to the edge of the con- tusion feeling hard, ivhilst the centre is soft, apparently fr’om the depression of the subjaeent bone. In some cases, indeed, this deceptive feehng vdll occur inthout any considerable extravasation of blood under the scalp, the depressed centre being due to the compression of the scalp by the blow that has been inflicted upon it. This I have seen occasionally in children in whom the scalp is soft and somewhat spongy. The difficulty of distinguishing between such an extravasation and a piece of depressed bone, is often so great as to mislead the most experienced Surgeons. Usually it can be effected by feehng the smooth bone at the bottom of the soft central depression, and by an absence of symptoms of compression. But in the event of doubt, it will be safer to make an incision, and so to examine directly the state of the bone itself. The Treatment of contusion of the scalp is very simple ; the continuous application of evaporating lotions being usually sufficient for the removal of all effusion. In no circumstances should a puncture be made or the blood let out in any way. Contusions of the scalp in girls and young women have been followed by severe neiwalgic pains in the j)art struck. This affection is extremely rebellious to treatment; but in two cases which I have seen, after lasting for a long time, these symptoms gradually disappeared. In such cases, incisions down to the bone are said to have sometimes been beneficial. C'EPHALHyEiiATOirA.—It occasioiiaUy happens that bloody tumoiu's of the scalp form in newly born children, either from contusion of the head in conse- quenee of the pressure to which it is subjected in its passage ; or fr’om the bruising of obstetric instruments. These tumours, which are often large and _ fluctuating, are termed cephalhaematomata. They may occur in two situa- tions, either hetiveen the cqmmurotic structures of the scalp and the pericranium, or between this membrane and the shull itself. ^ The Subaponeurotic Cephalhaematoma is by far the most common ’s ariety. It usually forms a large, soft, fluctuating tumour, situated upon one of the parietal eminences, and having a somewhat indurated circumference. The tumour may usually be made to subside in a few days by the use of discutient lotions. I he Subpericranial Cephalhaematonia is an injury of extremely rareINJURIES OF THE HEAD. 534 occurrence ; but Zeller, Valleix, and others, ha'S'e detenniued its existence. It appears as a fluctuating tumour, without discoloration of the scalp, but with a hard elevated circle aroiind it, and a soft depressed eentre, almost communi- cating the sensation of a hole in the cranium. Pressru’e, however, gives rise to no cerebral symptoms, and enables the Surgeon to feel the osseous lamina at the bottom of the depression. These tumours are usually small, seldom larger than a walnut, and it not unconunonly happens that they are multiple. It is worthy of note, hoAvever, that each tumoiu- is always confined to a separate bone, never passing beyond the sutures, where the adhesions are the strongest between the pericranium and the subjacent osseous structiuo. This affection is. said to be most frequently met with in children born in first confinements, and is more common in boys than in girls ; according to Bouchard, in the propor- tion of thirty-four to nine. The Pathology of this affection has been studied by YaUeix. This Surgeon fonnd that the pericranium was separated from the bone by an extravasation of blood, and that both bone and pericranium were covered vdth plastic matter, but otherwise healthy. He also found that the hard cucle surrounding the depression was formed by a deposit of osseous and plastic matter which bounded, the extravasation. This deposit was effected in such a way that, on a trans- verse section being made, the inner wall was found nearly perpendicular, whilst the outer sloped down upon the cranium, thus giving a crateriform appearance to the margin of the tumour. The Treatment of this affection must be conducted upon precisely the same principles as that of the other forms of scalp-extravasation. Worans OP the Scalp are of very common occruTence, and are more serious than corresponding injiuies elsewhere, especially in persons about the middle period of life, and of unhealthy or broken constitution. Not only are these injuries more hkely to be foUoAved by erysipelas than those of other parts of the body, but the great tendency to the propagation of inflammatory mischief inwards to the encephalon, and to the compheation of cerebral mis- cluef, often accompanying comparatively slight injmfles of the scalp, gives to these accidents much of their serious and often fatal character. But, though there be this danger to hfe in scalp-injiuies, there is comparatively httle risk to the scalp itself; fr-om the abundant supply of blood Avhich it receiA'es from closely subjacent arteries, and its consequent great A'itality, sloughing seldom occius, even though the part be much bruised and seriously lacerated. . i j. ..i The Treatment of wound of the scalp necessarily varies somewhat accoiU- ing to the nature of the injmy. If this be a simple cut, it will be sufficient, after shaving the parts around and cleansing its interior, to bring it together with a strip or two of adhesive plaster, and to efress it as lightly as possible. If the incision in the scalp be extensive, the lips of the wouiid must be brought together by a few points of metallic sutiue, or by hair-lip pnis. there be arterial hmmon-hage, this may usually be best arrested by passing the pins across and under the bleeding vessel, and compressing this with a hguic- of-8 suture. In this, as in all other cases of injmy of tie ea , cspccic attention should be paid to the state of the biain ; foi, houevei sit, i cxtenial wound may be, serious cerebral misehief may hav e been occasionccTREATMENT OF SCxiLP WOUNDS. 535 or, at all events, the same blow that has caused the cut in the scalp, may have (dven rise to such functional derangement of the Ijrain as may lead to the womt forms of traumatic encephahtis. It more frequently happens that the scalp is bruised and lacerated as well as wounded ; and very commonly that a large flap or integument is stripped oil the skull, and is thro^vn down o^-er the face or ear, so as to denude the bones. In these cases, advantage is taken of the great vitahty of the scalp. liowe\ei extensively contused or lacerated this may be, however much it may be begrimed with dirt, it is a golden rule in surgery not to cut any portion of it away, but, after shaving the head and ligatiu'ing any bleeding vessels, to wash and clean it thoroughly, and replace it in its pro2:>or position. Here it must be retained by the support of a few strij)s of plaster, or by the aj)phcation of a sutm’e or two at the points of greatest traction : for this 2)m’pose, thick silver-wme is better than silk or thread. The use of sutures has been dej)recated by many Surgeons in iujiu’ies of the seal}), as tending to favour erysipelas; and undoubt- edly much mischief Avill arise if an attempt be made to stitch np the womid closely, and in small wounds sutiu’es are generally unnecessary. But in exten- sive lacerations, more })articularly of the anterior part of the scalp, where the soft pai’ts are stripped olF, and hang over the occiput as the patient hes down, they cannot be dispensed with ; and here I have never seen any but the best consequences follow their use at those points where the torn sirnfaces can be readily approximated. In cases of this kind, the under siu’face of the scalp gi’amflates, and union by the second intention takes place between it and the pericranium. If the edges do not come properly together, a piece of Avater- dressing may be applied ; but the head must be kept cool, and as little band- aging and plastering had recoiu’se to as possible. The patient should be fi?eely purged, and kept perfectly at rest on a rather low diet; any cerebral symptoms that occiu’ being treated in accordance Avith the principles laid down in discus- sing traumatic affections of the brain. In this Avay, union Avill A’ery probably take place through the greater portion of the injm-ed siu’face ; should it not do so, however, or should any part slough, gTanulations spring up, and reparatiA'c action goes on with siuprising rapidity. If pus form beneath the aponem’osis of the occi})ito-frontahs muscle, bagging must be prevented by early counter- openings, and by the employment of compression in proper du’ections. It is important to make the diagnosis between tramnatic erysipelas of and abscess under the scalp. This may, as a rule, be done by obserAung that in eiysipelas the red tumefaction of the scalp extends from the mai’gins of the AAOund, and eai'ly stretches beyond the true limits of the pericranium, invading the eyelids, attacking the ears, etc.; AAfrilst in abscess, there is not only an absence of extension of disease, AAuth the exception possibly of oedema of the eyelids, beyond the proper limits of the scalp, but the pimulentj collection Avill giavitate to certain defined parts of the head, directed by the anatomical con- nections of the occipito-fr’ontalis. I he pericranial aponeurosis or tendon of the occipito-frontalis muscle is n-mly attached to the fat and fascia superficial to it, Avhilst it is comiectcd in le oosost manner possible Avith the parts underneath. This arrangement is 0 en of gi-eat semce m protecting the skull from fracture, espccially Avhen the ea is caught between two solid bodies, as, for example, the Avhecl of a cart536 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. ciiid the gvouuci, when the sealp is torn oh and tlie head slips away, so escaj^ing tinthei injiny. In suppiuation oecniTiiig under the tendon of the occipito- fiontalis, the pns giavitates to the most dependent parts until arrested bv the attachments of the aponeurosis. These attachments are as follow. Posteriorly, the fleshy bellies are attached to the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and the space between them is filled up by dense fascia similarly attached. Laterally, the tendon is connected with the attollcns and attrahens aurem, to the mastoid process, and in front of the car to the zygoma. Pus gi’avitatino’ in this direction, therefore, forms a bag of fluid just above the zygoma, never ex- tending into the cheek. In front, the fleshy flbres of the muscle are blended with those of the corrugator supercihi and the orbicularis palpebrarum ; while in the middle line they are continued down over the nose into those of the pyramidalis nasi; and the pus will therefore collect in the upper eyelids, and in a pouch over the root of the nose. When the wound is too tightly closed, the discharges force their w'ay in all directions in the loose tissue under the tendon, giving rise to general pufl^^ S'welling of the head and diffused redness, often extending over the face ; and it is probable that this state of things has often been confounded with erysipelas, and has given rise to the idea that stitches in the scalp give rise to that disease. If simple erysipelas supervene, that disease will require to be treated iii accord- ance Avith ordinary surgical principles. So far as the woimd in the scalp is concerned, that must be thrown open, aU dressings remoA’ed, and, if matter form, a free outlet must be afforded to the pus. If diffuse celluhtis occur, free incisions must be made through the puffy and swollen scalp, and counter- openings for the discharge of pus and sloughs. When the skull itself is extensively denuded in consequence of the peri- cranium being stripped off the subjacent bone together Avith a flap of the scalp, it does not necessarily follow that necrosis and exfoliation of the exposed bone Avill occur. The flap must be laid doAvn on the denuded osseous smface, to Avliich it may possibly contract adhesion thi’ough the medium of granulations. Should it, however, slough, and a large portion of the skuU be even exposed, exfoliation of the outer table, though probable, does not necessarily happen; lor, in some cases, instead of exfohating, the exposed portion of the skull Avill inflame, plastic matter be throAvn out, and, gTanulations springing up, a cover- ing be formed to the bone. FRACTUBES OF THE SKULL. Injuries of the Bones of the Skull, especially Fracture, possess great interest, not so much from the lesion of the bone itself; as fr-om its fr-equent compheation AAuth injury of the brain and its membranes. This cerebral complication may cither be produced by direct injury, the fr-agments of the fractmed bone com- pressing or wounding the brain; or it may be the result of concussion or laceration of the brain by the same violence that causes the fracture. Bending in of the Cranial bones without Fracture is an accident that may occur in infants and young children, before the bones of the skull aic completely ossified. In scA’cral instances, the displaced bone lias been raise ) aspiration with an india-rubber sucker. But no harm comes of leaving the bone depressed, as it will generally rccoA'cr its proper level in time.fractures of the skull. 537 CoNTUSiOJr OF THE CuANiAE Bo^^ES witliout fracture, occasioned either by ordinary direct violence or by tlie oblique impact of bullets, is a very serious injury, more particularly when complicated vutli wound of the scalp. In it there are three sources of danger, any one of which may be followed by a fatal result; viz.: 1. Necrosis of the part of bone struck, leading to exfoliation of the outer table, or to separation of the whole thickness of the cranium and ex- liosure of the dura mater ; 2. Suppuration under the skull, between it and the dura mater ; and, 3. Pyiemia i\'ith secondary visceral abseesses, in consequence of the suppuration of the diploe around the necrosed point of bone, and the entrance of pus into the cranial ^'eins,—a condition to which reference has already been made. The following statement, taken from the records of the War Department of the United States army, gives a good summary of the results of gun-shot con- tusions of the skull Muthout fracture. Of 328 cases, there died 5.5 ; disabled, 173 ; recovered, 100. The deaths arose fr’om hEemorrhage, 2 ; tetEinus, 4 ; pyasmia, 4 ; dysentery and fever, 8 ; compression fr'om blood or pus, 17 ; various intracranial injuries, 22.

Epilepsy. 10 Insanity. Fractures of the Skull are invariably the result of external Aiolence. I his may act directlij in breaking and sj)lintering the part struck, the fissures often extending to a considerable disttnice and detaching large portions of the skull; or the \iolence may act in an indirect manner, producing the fi’acture cither without being applied immediately to the cranium, or else at an opposite part of the skull to that which is struck. Thus the base of the skull may be fractured by the shock communicated to it when a person, falling fr-om a height, strikes the gTound heavily with his feet. The -s'ariety of indirect fr-ac- turc m which the lesion occurs at a point of the skull opposite to that wliich has been struck, is the Fracture Vij Contrecouj).INJURIES OF THE JfEAI). 53S Fracture by Contrecoup lias boon doscrilicd )>y some Surgeons as of fi’e- quenfc occuiTcnce, whilst it has been denied by others. There can, however, be no doubt that it does happen, though less commonly, perhaps, than is geneially supposed. Il/very hospital Surgeon must occasionally have seen une- quh ocal instances of it. hor its occurrence, several conditions are necessary. The skull must be struck over a large sin-face, as when a person falls with his head against the ground. If a blow fall on a thin portion of it, this Avill be fractured directly ; but if a dense and strong part of the bone be struck, as the parietal eminence, or the lower part of the os frontis, the shock transmitted through the skull generally will cause the thinnest and most brittle portions of it, though distant, to give w^ay in preference to the stronger part on which the blow has immediately fallen. The fractin-c by contrecoup is most common at the base of the skull, and is usually much radiated. It is always fissured, never depressed. SniPLE Fracture.—Au ordinai-y simple or undepressed fracture of the skull consists in a fissiu-e, sometimes smgle, at other times stai-red, extend- ing often to a considerable distance through the bones, radiating sometimes across the skull, and in other cases completely detaching its upper fr-om its lower part, or its anterior from its posterior segment. In some cases the frac- tiu-e extends into one of the sutiues ; and in other instances, which, however, are vei-y rare, the sutiues are separated wdthout any fractiue. The injury usually occius from duect violence, but is also the only form of fr-acture that happens by contrecoup. A fissiue or fracture, such as this, gives rise to no signs by which its diagnosis can be effected, and often escapes detection altogether, more iiarticularly when the scalp covering it is not wounded, or, if contused, when so large a quantity of blood is extravasated as to render it impossible for the Surgeon to feel the subjacent bone. If, however, the scalp covering the injured bone have been womided, its exist- ence may be ascertained by running the finger-nail, or the end of a probe, over the exposed surface of the bone, or by seeing a fissure into which the blood sinks. As the whole importance and danger of fractiue of the skull depend, not upon the injiuy that the bone has sustained, but on the concomitant or secondary lesions of which the contents of the cranium are the seat, no special Treaiment is required for the fr-acture itself when simple and undepressed, the Surgeon’s whole attention being directed to the injiuy that may have been inflicted on the brain or scalp. Active precautionary- measures should be adopted without delay, -with the view' of guarding against the occm-rcnce of inflammation of the brain and its membranes, even though no symptoms hai'e as yet declared themselves. So soon as the patient has recovered fr-om the concussion, his head should be shaved, an ice-bladder applied, and blood taken fr-om the arm ; the bowels should be w'ell opened, and the room kept cool and quiet. The employment of fr-ee and, if need be, repeated bleeding is, howei-er, of more service than any other means, and should never be onnttcd, except in feeble, very young, or aged subjects. In Chronic Hydrocephalus, the cranial bones are thinned and expanded : but, being at the same time preternatiuiially elastic and mobile, they are seldom fraeturcd. When they are so injured, the presence of the water may539 FRACTURE OF BASE OF SKULL. save the brain from the direct effects of the blow. In one case that Avas under my care, the hydrocephalic child fell from the top of a house on to its head, and sustained a long fr-acture through the left side of the skull, but Avithout any scalp-AVOund. Shortly after the accident, a large soft fluctuating tumoim formed under the scalp opposite the line of fracture ; and, on this being tapped, about three ounces of liydi'ocophalic fluid Avere draAvn off. This operation Avas repeated, but the child died about ten days after the injury, Avith hemiplegia of the opposite side, and Avith coiiAmlsions. Fracture oe the Base oe the Skull.—The most serious, aud indeed a very commonly fatal form of fissure or simple fracture of the skull, is that Avhich extends through its Use. It may occur in three A\uys. 1. This injiuy is usually caused by direct vTolence, as by a fall or a IjIoaa' uj)on the vertex or side of the head, producing a fractime AA^hich extends fr-om the point struck across to the base of the skull, often running through the petrous portion of the temporal bone or into the foi’amen magnum. 2. It may also take place as the result of contrecoup, the bloAV being received on the forehead, back, or side of the head, and the jar of the bones expending its greatest vdolence on and fractiu’ing the base of the skull ; and 3, by the impact of the spine against the condyles of the occipital bone causing a fractiu’e that radiates from the foramen magnmn. This kind of fr’actime of the bone is AveU illustrated by the amiexed cuts (Figs. 241,242), taken from patients of mine Avho feU. from a height on the head.

The great danger in tliese cases arises from the concomitant injury to the brain, either by direct laceration or by the extravasation of blood under it. Though most usually fatal, these inju- ries are not invariably so. Not only does it occasionally happen that patients with all those signs of fi'actiu’o of the base of the skull, which will immediately be described, are seen to make a complete recovery, but in the different Museums specimens illustrative of recovery after this accident may be met with, 'f'hus, in the College of Surgeons’ Museum, there is the skull of a person who lived two years after a fractiu’e of its base. Signs.—Fracture of the base of the skull is very commonly suspected when symptoms indicative of serious injmy to the brain speedily follow a severe blow upon the head. Those parts of the nervous centre that are most im- portant to life are more liable to injmy in this than in other fractures of the skull; the same violence that occasions the ffactiu’e injming the contiguous portions of brain, or lacerating some of the large venous sinuses at the base of the skull, and thus giving rise to abundant intracranial extravasation of blood. These symptoms are necessarily in the highest degree ecpiivocal; and much anxiety has consequently been manifested by Siu’geous to discover some special sign of the occurrence of this particular fi’acturc. The signs of fracture of the base of the skull will necessarily vary according to the seat of injury. When the fissin-e extends through the anterior fossa, there may be extravasation of blood into the orbit or eyelid, or fr’ee ha3mor- rhage from the nose. When it implicates the middle fossa, there is, in all probability, fr’actine of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, v\dth ruptin-e of the tympanic membrane, and then there will be bleeding or a watery dis- charge from the ears. 'When the posterior fossa is the seat of injmy, the signs are more equiv'oeal, unless the fissure extend forwards to the petrous portion of the temporal bone, vvfren the more characteristic signs will ocemv There are two signs, the occurrence of which, separately or together, leads to strong presumptive evidence of the existence of this kind of fracture. 1. The Escape of Blood from the interior of the Craniiun through the ears, nose, or into the orbit; and 2. The Discharge of a Serous Fluid from the Ears, and occasionally from other parts in connection with the base of the skull. 1. The occinTence of Bleeding from one or both Ears after an injmy of the head cannot by itself be considered a sign of much importance, as it may arise from any violence by which the membrana tympani is ruptm’ed, without the skull being necessarily fractm-ed. If, however, the htemorrhage be con- siderable, trickling slowly out of the external auditory meatus in a continuous stream, if the blood with which the external ear is filled pulsate, and more especially if the bleeding be associated v\dth other symptoms indicative of serious mischief within the head, and if it have been occasioned by a degree o violence sufficient to fracture the skull, we may look upon the hasmorrhage as strong presumptive evidence that a fr’acture of the base of the skull, extenc in^ into the petrous portion of the temporal bone, has taken place, and t lat, pci haps, one of the venous sinuses in its neighbourhood is tom. i.ive sccu patients recover without any bad consequences from copious aiiia icemoii 111^,0 after severe head-injury. The evidence therefore is only picsumpivc, 1FRACTURE OF RASE OF SKULL. 541 not positive as to fracture of tlie base of the skull through its petrous por- tion, or indeed of any intracranial injiuy whatever. Copious ha3morrhago from the oar to the extent of many ounces has been known to occur from a fracture of the anterior and inferior part of the meatus auditorius externu.^', in consequence of the condyle of the lower jaw being forcibly driven up against it, the jaw itself having been fractured. Hemorrhage into the Areolar Tissue of the Orbit and Eyelid, giving rise to extensive ecchymosis of the lid, possibly with protrusion of the eye-ball itself, often accompanies fracture of the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The ecchymosis that occurs in these cases arises fr’om the filtration of the blood fr-om the interior of the skull, through the fr-acture, into the loose areolar tissue adjacent to the injured bone. It differs remarkably in appearance from that resulting fr-om a direct blow upon the eyelid—fr-om a “ black eye.” In the latter case there is bruising- of the skin, and the ecchymosis is in a great measure cutaneous, of a reddish-purple colour. In the ecchymosis fr-om fracture, the hasmoirhage is entirely subcutaneous and subconjunctival: there is probably no bruising of the eyelid, but this is tense, greatly swollen, and of a pimple colour. The extravasation appears under the ocular conjunctiva in a very marked manner, which is rarely the case in an ordinary black eye, where the ecchymosis is superficial to the palpebral ligament, and shut off fr-om the subconjimctival areolar tissue. This haemorrhage may be venous or arterial. "When venous, it probably arises fr-om laceration of the cavenious sinus. When arterial, it may, as Hewett has shown, be the forerunner of a circumscribed traumatic aneiu-ism of the orbit, attended by pulsation, bruit, and projection of the eyeball, requiring the deligation of the common carotid for its ciu-e. Bleeding from the Hose or Mouth may of course arise fr-om any injiu-y of these parts without the skull being implicated ; yet in some cases of frac- ture of the skuU the hiemorrhage proceeds from the interior of the cranium, through a fissure in the roof of the nasal fosste ; it then indicates a fr-actiu-e through the ethmoid and sphenoid bones. In a patient of mine who died five weeks after an injury of the head, accompanied by bleeding from the nose, a fracture occasioned by contrecoup was fomid extending across one orbital plate of the fr-ontal bone, and separating its articulation with the ethmoid. In this case, the nature of the injury was suspected from the fact of the nose itself having been uninjured by the blow, although the hemorrhage fr-om it was very considerable and continuous ; for it is in the quantity and duration of this hemoiThage that its value as a diagnostic sign of fr-actm-e of the base of the skull consists. , Vomiting of Blood may occur in these cases, fr-om the blood having found its way through the fractured ethmoid or sphenoid down the nose and throuo-h the posterior nares into the pharynx and stomach. In these cases the vomited blood is dark, grumous, and mixed with the contents of the stomach. In some rare cases, the blood that issues from the nose and mouth passes into these cavities through the Eustachian tube. The petrous portion of the temporal bone is fractured, and the middle ear opened ; the tympanic membrane, how- ever, being unbroken, no bleeding fr-om the external ear ensues, but the blood escapes into the pharynx through the Eustachian tube. In some cases there may be a combination of these different signs. Thus, in a patient of mine atIiYJURIES OF THE HEAD. 542 the Hospital, there were htEmon-hage into the left orhit and fi'om the left nostril, copious vomitino- of blood, and bleeding ftora the rig-ht ear, following a blow upon the forehead. The diagnosis which was made during life, and Avhich was verified after death, was a fissure of the skull extending through the left orbital plate of the frontal bone, the ethmoid, and proljably the sphenoid on that side, and a fracture of the petrous portion of the right temporal bone. 2. The Discharge of a thin Watery Fluid from the interior of the skull sometimes occurs ; and, Avhen it happens, it is the most certain sign of ft'actiu’e of the base that we possess. This discharge usually takes place through the ear ; but it may occim from the nose, of which I have seen one instance, and Robert mentions another. Still more rarely it takes place fr'om a wound in the scalp communicating with the fr’actime ; percolating through this, and so being poured out externally. Cases of this kind have been de- scribed by Hey, O’Callaghan, Robert, Hewett, and other Simgeons. One such instance was communicated to me by one of the pupils of University College, a few years ago. A boy received a wound on the back of the head, with depressed and comminuted fracture of the skull. On the nineteenth day after the receipt of the injmy, a large quantity of serous fluid began to escape thi'ough the wound, and continued to do so profusely until his death fr-om ■coma "four days later. At first the fluid that is discharged is usually tinged with blood, but this soon ceases, and it then flows clear. There would consequently appear to be thi-ee situations—the ear, the nose, and a w'ornid on the vault of the cranium—fr-om which this discharge has been ■obsei-A-ed. It is an exceedingly valuable though most serious sig-n; and Robert, who has inA'estigated this phenomenon with much closeness, states that the cases in which it happens always terminate fatally. This, however, is an ■error ; for a number of cases have occurred at the University College Hospital and elsewhere, in Avhich the patients, adults, recovered, although many omices of fluid were discharged fr-om the ear. It is usually associated with symptoms indicatHe of serious injm-y tq, the base of the brain ; but to this there are also exceptions, for I have seen it in cases of injin-y of the head, unaccompanied by any severe cerebral symptoms. Most generally it occiu-s in young- peo]jle. Robert says that it does so invariably ; but Hewett states that in most of the instances in which he has seen it the patients were above thu-ty years of age.^ In one of the cases that I have witnessed, the patient was flfty-eight yeai-s of ao-e ; and in six other instances in which I have observed it, the patients were aU adults. In all cases of recovery that I have witnessed, some deafness of the ear fr-om which the discharge occurred has been left ; but the hearing, though usually lost, does not always appear to be destroyed in the ear from which the discharge takes place. ’ The ^Quantity of fluid that is thus discharged is always very considerable, the pillow usually becoming soaked by it, ivhich may be the first thing to attract attention to it. It is often necessary to keep a piece of sponge or a pledget of lint against the ear, in order to prevent the fluid from wetting the patient as it trickles out ; and, if a cup be so placed as to collect it or two will speedily accumulate. Laiigier states that he has seen a tiimblcrtul discharged in a short time, and as much as twenty ounces have been known toSOUBCE OF SEROUS DISCHARGE FROM SKULL. 543 1)0 ponvecl out ia tlivee clays. The flow is usually continuous for sec'eral days, ami tlien ceases. Altliougli the occurrence of a watery discharge from tlie ear after certain injuries of tlie head had been obsen'ed by Van der Wiel, O’Halloran, and Dease, in the early part and middle of tbe last centmy, no attention was paid to the subject by later surgical writers ; and the subject appears to have been completely lost sight of until Laugier, in 1839, again directed the attention of Siu’geons to this interesting phenomenon. tSince this period, it has been often observed and attentively studied ; and the nature and the soiu’ce of this dis- charge have l)een particularly investigated by Laugier, Chassaignac, Robert, Guthrie, and Hewett. Its physical and chemical characters are those of a per- fectly clear, limpid, and watery fluid, containing a considerable quantity of chloride of sodium, with a ^little albumen in solution, and some sugar. It is not coagulable by heat nor by nitric acid. The Source of this discharge has been the subject of much speculation. Laugier belie’^'ed it to be the serum of the blood filtered through a crack in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and so through the ruptm’ed membrane tympani. This explanation, however, is evidently not correct; for not only is blood extravasated in the living body incapable of this species of rapid and complete filtration, but the fluid differs altogether in chemical comjDosition from the serum of the blood, in containing a mere trace of albumen and double the quantity of chloride of sodium. By others it has been supposed that the fluid is fiu'uished by the internal ear, being a continuous discharge of the liquor Cotunnii; but its large quantity, and, above aU, the fact of its occasionally escaping through the nose, demonstrate the fallacy of this explanation. Again, it has been supposed, but without sufficient evidence, that the ca^-ity of the arachnoid frumishes this secretion. But the arachnoid does not secrete sufficiently to fm’nish the quantity of fluid discharged ; and if this membrane were iridtated and the secretion increased, it would become opaque from lymph or pus admixed mth it. I think, with Robert, that there can be little doubt that this discharge, in most cases at least, consists of the cerebro-spinal fluid ; for not only is it, in appearance and chemical composition, identical with this liquid, but there is no other source within the skull than the pia mater which can yield with equal rapidity so large a quantity of fluid ; experiment on animals having shown that the cerebro-spinal fluid is rapidly reproduced after its evacuation. An additional point of analogy between this discharge and the cerebro-spinal fluid is to be found in the fact pointed out by C. Bernard, that they both contain a small quantity of sugar. In order that the fluid be dis- charged, the membranes of the brain must have been torn opposite the outlet by which it is poured forth. This has actually been ascertained to be the case by carefully conducted dissections. Wien it is discharged through the eai-,’ the laceration, as B^rard has remarked, must have extended through the cul- de-sac of the arachnoid, which is iirolonged around the auditory nerve in the nitemal auditory canal. When it is poured out through the nose, the friicture las probably extended through the cribriform plate of the etlimoid bone and aid open the prolongation of arachnoid that suiTounds the filaments of the olfactory nerve. The diagnostic value of watery discharge fr-om the eai* varies, accordino- to544 INJUlUEti OF THE HEAD. Hcwctt, wifcli its relation to the ha3moiThagc Avhich may occur. He divides cases of Avatery discliargc from the ear after injuries of the head into three classes. In the first class, the discharge is Avatery from the first, and abundant, being preceded by httle or no blood, and beginning immediately after the accident. This is undoubtedly cerebro-spinal fluid, Avhich escapes through a fracture of the petrous bone impheating the internal auditory canal. In the second class, there is copious and prolonged bleeding from the ear, foUowed by the AA^atery discharge. Here, too, there is fr’actime of the petrous bone : but its exact situation is uncertain. In these cases, the diagnosis Avill rest upon the prolonged haemorrhage, rather than on the Avatery discharge. In the third class, there is but little bleeding after the injury, and the Avatery discharge, Avhich is variable in quantity, varies also in the time of its appearance. In these cases the diagnosis must remain doubtful. He mentions tAvo cases Avhich occurred at St. George’s Hospital in Avhich a copious Avatery discharge floAved from the ear. In neither of these after death AV'as any fr'acture of the petrous portion of the temporal bone foimd. In one the membrana tympani was ruptured, and the caAuty of the tympanum was “ intensely vascular ; in the other, “ the discharge Avas coimected Avith a fracture of the lower jaw just beloAv the condyle : the loAver fr-aganent had perforated the wall of the meatus auditorius.” The facial nerve may be so injured by a fr-actime of the petrous portion of the temporal bone as to become paralysed at the time of the accident. But more frequently paralysis of this nerve does not come on until a later period, about the second or third Aveek after the injmy, and disappears after lasting about a month. This transient facial paralysis accompanying some forms of fractiu-e of the base of the skiiU has been studied by Marshall, Avho mgemoiisly explains it as being occasioned by the pressime of plastic effusions, which gradually become absorbed as the fr’acture unites, and thus the compression of the nerve is removed after a time. Treatment.—The treatment of fractiu’e of the base_ of the skiiU must be conducted on those general principles that guide us iii the management o simnlefr’actiires of the cranium, such as ice to the shaved head, a calomel purge, low diet, and absolute quietude in a darkened rooni. Ii\most cases the bra is so injiu-ed in its most vital parts that speedy death is the result. Mhen recovery takes place, it is necessarily slow and protracted, hable to retardation from meningitis of an acute or subacute and chronic character. Depressed Fracture of the Skull.—It occasionally though very rare y happens that, in consequence of a blow, a portion of the sknfr is depressed Avithout being fractured, and even Avithoiit any serious cerebra symptoms occiirriuo’ Such depression Avithoiit fractime can, however, oidy occiii in Sen" whose skiiUs are soft and yielding.

In the Diagnosis of depressed fracture, it is important to remember that the apparent depression produced by an extravasation under the scalp may simulate this injury A'ery closely ; for even an experienced Surgeon may sometimes in these circumstances be induced to cut donm on a suspected fi'acture, when in reality none exists. This happens in consequence of the blood that is extravasated coagulating round the circumference of the contusion, whilst that which is in the centre remains fluid, so that a very deceptive sensation of a hollow with a hard rim is communicated to the finger. Varieties.—Depressed fractures of the skull may cither be simple, Avithout Avound of the scalp ; compound ; or comminuted. In the majority of cases, whether the fracture be simple or compound, there is comminution of the bone ; the fragments being perhaps dri\^en into the brain. Sometimes, though very rarely, the external table alone is depressed and driven into the diploe. This is especially the case over the fr’ontal sinuses,. where it may be broken in, as I have seen happen fr’om the kick of a horse, without the inner table being splintered, or any bad consequence ensuing. The inner table may be fr-actured without any apparent injmy to the outer table ; and it may not only be so fr-actured, but a portion of it may be depressed, Avithout the outer table being injiu-ed (Figs. 245, 246). Of this remarkable injury twenty cases are recorded as having happened in the late American war. One recovered, the diagnosis being made by finding the splintered inner table in a sequestrum which was removed. The rest died of intracranial mischief, and the diagnosis was not made dining life. More commonly, when the inner table is thus fr-actured or depressed, the outer table is fissined. In all ordinary depressed fractures, the internal table is splintered to a greater extent than the external one. This is espe- oially the case when the fr-acture is the result of gun-shot injury, or when it has been occasioned by blows with a pointed weapon, as the end of a pick, 01 a laige nail, or the sharp angle of a brick. In these fractiu-es, which con- stitute the dangerous variety termed Pxiiictured, the outer table may be merely perforated or fissured, whilst the inner one is AAudely sphntered into numerous fr-agments, for the extent of a square inch or more. This splintering of the inner lamina of the skull to a greater extent than the outer one has attracted much attention, being of considerable practical moment, and is usually said to be oAving to its being more brittle than the external table. This, hoAvever, I do not consider to be the only cause. I should rather attribute it 0 the fractm-ing force fr-oin Avithout inwards losing a certain amount of the inner table beine- momentum in passing through the outer table - ^ O- UCWiC uciiiy thus splintered more widely than the outer one, for the same reason that the perture of exit made by a bullet is larger than that of entry. If this be the true explanation, the reverse ought to hold good if the force bo applied in the opposite direction.

On examining the state of the bones, it was found that the outer table of the skull was splintered to a considerably greater extent Fig. 243.—Fi-aetoe of tlie Skull from Gun-shot Kg. 244.—The same—natural size, Injury from witluii: Splintering of Outer Table. than the inner one, showing clearly the influence of the direction of the fiiactur- ino- force (Figs. 243, 244). This case led me to make finther experiments on the dead body; and I found that the outer table is always more sphntered when the blow is struck from the inside of the skull outwards. Teevan has made a considerable number of ingenious experiments on this subiect, by firing bullets and clrmng pointed bodies of various kinds tlmoug the'skull. He finds, as the result of these investigations, that the aperture o± exit is the larger, whether the blow be delivered, or the bullet be driven from without inwards, or the reverse. The explanation at which he has ai^ived is that the aperture of entry is caused by the penetrating body only, ^'^sUlie aperture of exit is caused by thisilZ^^s the fragments of bone driven ^ t^le of the skuU which was first perforated. Thus, when a bullet strikes th external table from ivithout, it first perforates this, ‘^^d then carries along wi it and thi-ough the inner table the fragments of bone that it has cut out of extanal table, and hence fr-actmes the inner table more ^-^ely than When both sides of the head are traversed by a bullet, it aviU the aperture of entiwin the outer table on the side fii’st struck, and the apertine S t ft ‘ inJ table of fte opposite side of fte head, bo the sma« fte tegest holes made by the bullet being the apertures on ^ fte forher side and the outer table of the latter.

In other cases, again, a portion of the skull is completely sliced oil', hanging down in a flap of the scalp, and exposing the brain or its membranes. A special and ’^■ery important kind of punctured and depressed fracture is that in which, by the thrust of a stick, mnbrclla, or other blunt-ended body into the orbit, the orbital plate of the frontal bone, or the cribriform lamella of the ethmoid, is perforated, and the dura mater or brain wounded. In such cases there is sometimes no external wound, the stick ha^dng passed up under the upper eyelid ; and it is conceivable that the same result might even be produced by a thrust up the nostril. Death results either from wound of the cavernous sinus and intracranial extravasation of blood, or more remotely from the secondary inflammatory effects of the wound of the dura mater and brain. It is very important to observe that the inner table may be very extensively fissured, fractured, and depressed, uitliout any fracture of the outer table.

N N 2ns JURIES OF THE HEAD. 548 Tlie Symptoms of a dcpressod fracture of the fikidl arc of two kinds ; those that are dependent npon the injury to the bone, and those that result from the coucomitant compression or laceration of the brain. AVhen the scalp is not wounded, the depression may sometimes be felt; but TCi'y commonly it is masked by extravasation of blood about it, and the Surgeon is only led to suspect its existence by the continuance of symptoms of compression from the time of the injury. In all cases of doubt, when these symptoms exist, an incision should be made through the scalp at the seat of injury and the state of the skull examined. When there is a wound in the scalp ’communicating with the fracture, the Sin-geon detects at once the existence of depression and commimrtion by examinmg the bone A^ith his finger through the wound. When the fragments that arc depressed are im- pacted and firmly locked together, so as to form an imyieldmg mass, s^ptoms of compression of the brain, to a more or less marked degree, nsnaUy result But if the fracture be very extensive, and the fragments, though somewhat depressed, lie loose, and if they be yielding and do not exercise a continuous pressure on the brain, it occasionally happens that no ccrebral^ disturbance comes on for some days, even though the injmy be very exteiwve. A man twenty-four years of age was admitted into University CoUege Ho^ital. e had been struck on the forehead vdth the sharp edge of a quoit.

In militaiy jn-actice it has often hap- pened that, as the result of sabre-ents, portions of the skull have been sliced or split down, the subjacent membranes and the brain itself being Avounded, and yet a good recovery has resulted ; and I have had several cases under my own care in Avhich, though the dura mater has been punctured by spicula of depressed fractures, and portions of brain lost, the patients have made good recoveries. The Treatment of a depressed and comminuted fractiu-e of the skull varies not only according to the nature and extent of the accident, but also to the existence or absence of symptoms of compression of the brain. If there be no Avoimd in the scalp, but the occurrence of symptoms of com- pression and the existence of some irregularity of the skull at the seat of injury lead the Simgeon to suspect a depressed fracture, he should make a crucial or T-shaped incision down upon the part in order to examine the bone ; and, if this be found depressed, he should elevate or remove it. If the scalp be ah-eady wounded, all that need be done to ascertain the natiu-e of the fr’acture, is to pass the finger very gently into the Avound and thus examine the bone. If any fr’ag- ments be found lying loose, they should be jneked out, as they can only excite injimious uTitation ; any bone that is driA'en below its level must be raised, and, if completely detached, removed. In order to raise these depressed portions of bone, it is in many cases merely necessary to introduce the point of an elevator underneath the fragment, and, using the instrument as a lever, raise it into position (Fig. 247). If there be not an aj)ertm’e suffi- ciently laige foi the introduction of the elevator, one may be made by saAAung Fig. 247.—Apxilication of Elevator.

If, however, the inner table be splintered to a considerable extent, or if there be no convenient angle that can be I’emoved, the trephine must be applied in such a way that at least half its circle is situated upon the edge that o'rerhangs the depressed bone ; the Surgeon sawing out by means of this instrument a portion of the undepressed skull, in order that he may more conveniently get at the fragment. After a half circle of bone has been removed in this way, the depressed splinters may be taken out, a Hoy’s saw still being occasionally required before the whole can be removed ; the flaps of scalp should then be laid domi, a sutine or tAvo appUed, and water-dressing put over the Avound. Rigorous treatment must then be adopted, with the view of preventing or removing inflanunatory symptoms. From the success that has attended the treatment of depression of the skull without fracture, by means of pneumatic traction, it has been recommended in cases of simple depressed fracture, AAuthorrt injm’y of the brain or its mem- branes, to make an attempt to draw the depressed portion of bone to its normal level by means of a cupping-glass, adapted to the uneven surface of the skull by means of a cell of glazier’s putty. In all cases of Punctured Fracture, AAffiere there is but slight iujmy of the external table, Avith considerable splintering and depression of the inner one, or where there is a narrow and deep depression of the bone, the trephine must be apphed on different principles from those that guide us in its use in ordinary depressed fr’actines. In the punctured fractm’e it is apphed, not to remove symptoms of compression which, in all probabihty, may not exist; but with the AueAV of preventing the inflammation Avhich will to a certainty be set up if the splinters of the inner table be alloAA'ed to continue irritating the membranes and brain. Hence it is a rule in singery, in all cases of pimctm’ed fracture, to apply the trephine at once. In these cases a trephine AAuth a lai’ge crown shordd be used, and the circle of mjm’ed bone itself must be sawn aAvay (Fig. 250). Should, hoAvever, the use of the trephine have been delayed in these cases until inflammatory action has been set up, the instrument may still be applied AAuth advantage. Many years ago a boy was admitted into University College Hospital, on the sixteenth day after having been struck on the side of the head by a large nail, which projected from a door that fell upon hhn. Ro symptoms of any kind had occinred until the eleventh day after the accident, when he became duU and lost his appetite ; on the sixteenth day, that of his amission, he had suddenly become drowsy and dehrious, but answered rationally when spoken to, and complained of pain in the head. The pupils Aj^ere dilated, the skin hot, and the pulse quick. On examination, a small round apertme, iioin which some fetid pus exuded, was discovered on the right parietal eminence. On introducing a probe, nbich the Fig. 250.—Treiihiued circle rotiucl Pimctiired Frac- tvu'e. Natural size. be felt. S. Cooper immediately trephined the boy, renioTing a eirele of to including the smaU apcrtin-e. The inner table corresponding to tins sphntered to some extent, and the dura mater was thickened and inflamed , but the patient recoA'ered Avithout a bad symptom. ITREATMENT OF DEPRESSED FRACTURE. 551 Linear Cuts, as by sabre or batchefc, into the skull, j)cuetrating the outer table, are apt to splinter the inner one, in the same way as occui's in a “ punctiu-ed” fracture, to which they bear a close analogy. They require the same preventive trephining that is needed in the true punctured fractm-e, having for its object the removal of splinters and spicula, which would infallibly produce a fatal meningitis if left. In those rare cases iii which there is a Depressed Fracture, without symptoms of compression or even a wound of the sealp, the rule of prac- tice is somewhat unsettled, as to whether the depressed portion of bone should be left where it is, or an attempt be made to elevate it. Sir A. Cooper, Abernethy, and Dupuytren advise that, if it do not give rise to any symptoms of compression, it is better not to interfere with it; and there are several cases on record of patients who have reeovered in whom this course was adopted, the depression eontinuing permanent. That non-interference is the p)roper coiu-se to pursue in some cases, more particularly in children, there can be no doubt. I have had under my care a child in whom, in consequence of a fall, there was on one of the parietal bones a depression as large as a croum- piece, its edges being sharply defined : no signs of compression or of inflam- mation of the brain ensued, and it was consequently left without interference, the child making an excellent recovery, and continuing well. Indeed, in childi'en, the amount of injury that may be inflicted on the brain not only by compression but by actual laceration, and yet be followed by recovery, is very surprising. In the adult, the cerebral substance does not accommodate itself so readily to injuries, and here the line of practice is not quite so definite. But even in persons of mature age, under certain favourable circumstances, bone may be depressed and continue so without giving rise either to compression of the brain or to inflammation of its membranes. I had once under my care a case which illustrated this point forcibly. The patient, a middle-aged man, fell on his head into an area, and stripped off the greater part of the scalp from the anterior part of the head and the vertex ; on the upper part of the left parietal bone was a staiTed and depressed fractm’e of the skull as large as a florin. As the depression was smooth, not more than a quarter of an inch in depth, and there was no symptom of compression, I drew the scalp forwards and left the bone untouched, the patient making an excellent recovery, without any symptom of intracranial^ mischief. I am also acquainted with a gentleman upwards of fifty years of age, who has a depression in the parietal bone as large as the bowl of a table-spoon, the result of a fractiu’e by a fall from a horse when a lad, and from which no inconvenience has resulted. I think, however, that the expectant treatment should not be followed too implicitly, but that we must be guided by the circumstances of the particular case. If the depression be nearly uniform, of inconsiderable depth, and occupy a large extent of skull, which is depressed in a smooth hollow or bowl-like manner, and more especially if the patient be young and the scalp unwounded, it may be better doubtless to follow the advice of Cooper, Abernethy, and Dupuytren, and to wait for symptoms of compression manifesting themselves before we interfere.^ If, however, the scalp be wounded, the depression sharp, deep, and comparatively small in extent, we may reasonably suspect the existence of552 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. considerable splintering of tbe inner table ; and here, I think, the safer plan would be, even in the absence of all symptoms of compression, to elevate for the same reason that we trephine in punctured fracture—the prevention of inflammatory action that will be occasioned by the irritation of the splinters of the inner table. I Avould not, however, ventiu’c to dogmatise on this veiy important and difficult point of practice. The opinions of the most expe- rienced Surgeons are at variance ; and cases may readily be adduced on either side in support of conflicting doctrines. It would appear that military Surgeons generally are in favour of the expectant plan, and cases may be found ill the works of Guthrie, Balhngall, &c., in support of this practice ; and it is a I’emarkable circumstance that, in many of these instances in which recovery resulted in cases of depressed fracture of the skuU which ivere not subjected to operative interference, the patients were exposed to great priva- tions, possibly during a hiu’ried retreat, and left in circumstances apparently the least favourable to recoveiy. So far as my own experience is concerned, which is necessarily drawn purely from civil practice, I can say that, vdth the exception of the case that has just been referred to, I do not recollect e'ser haidng seen a case recover in which a compound depressed fracture of the skull occurring in the adult had been left ivithout operation ; but I have, on the other hand, seen several instances of recovery in which the bone had been elevated and fragments removed. The sooner elevation is done the better. Danger does not arise from eaily operation, but fr’om delay. The presence of depressed and spiculated fr:agments pressing into the diwa mater must inexdtably and speedily induce encephahtis. I have several times trephined in such circumstances as these with success, and have never had occasion to regret doing so. Indeed, there is no class of cases in which the operation of trephining is attended by such successful results as m those of depressed and comminuted fracture. Even though several days have elapsed and inflammation has set in, the proper treatment wifi be to remove the depressed and splintered bone, and thus give the patient his oidy chance a slender one, it is true—of recovery. In such adverse circimstances the patient may, however, be saved. A man was admitted under Liston wi i a long depressed fr-actiwe on the side of the head, produced by the blow of a brickbat; though no sign of compression existed, yet syuiptoms of cerebra inflammation were speedily set up, and Liston trephined him on the fourth day after the accident; the man, who was perfectly conscious walking into the operating theatre. A considerable splintering of the inner table was foimd, the fragmmte of «re romoTed. The dm-a mater harmg been by one of the spionla of bone, diffuse suppin-ation of tbe membranes of the bia n sJt in and the patient died in a few days. In this case, however tbe necessity for eriy trephining was clearly indicated, notwithstanding the absence of any TbernttS^aSts of rvactuve of the ShuU in those who recover will less closely resemble the conditions given atp. 53/, as t tusion of the cranium without fr-acture.

In such a case as this, howe'S'er, we should, I think, treat the depressed fr’acture in-espectively of the vertebral injury, thus giving the patient a chance of recovery, of prolongation of life, or, at least, of retimi of consciousness before death, A man Avas admitted under my care into the Hospital, vuth depressed fr-acture of the left parietal bone, and injury of the ccr\ ical spine, the precise nature of which could not be accurately determined. He Avas in a state of comjAlete coma and jraralysis. I trephined the skull and elevated the depressed portion of bone ; he recoA’ered his con- sciousness to a great degree, but died in a few days, ajrparently fr-om injury to the spine. On examination after death, we found a fracture of the fifth cerA'ical vertebra. INJURIES OF THE CONTENTS OF THE CRANIUM. irouxDS OF THE Brain AND ITS MEMBRANES are fr'equent in injuries of the head, and are among the most important compheations of these accidents. The extent of injury inflicted upon the cerebral substance has wide limits, fr'om slight laceration Avithout exposrue, to denudation of the brain, disintegra- tion, and escape of large portions of its substance. Causes.—Injury to the brain may be occasioned in various ways. The simplest form is that, perhaps, which is not unfrequently met Avith in unde- pressed fracture of the skuU, and sometimes happens without fr-acture, from simple concussion or commotion of the head ; laceration of the cerebral sub- stance occiuTing under the seat of injury, or more fr-equently at a distant or opposite point, by a kind of confrecoup. This laceration of the Irain hj contrecoip is by no means of unfrequent occiUTence. I have seen many striking instances of it, and haA’e found it to be one of the commonest causes of death in simple fracture of the skull. Laceration of the brain by contrecoup is attended by much extraA asation of blood ; and after death the brain-substance is found mixed iqi Avith coagula, and forming a soft, puljiy, bloody mass. In most in- stances that I haA e seen, the anterior lobes have been thus contused, lacerated, and disorganised. This accident may occiu without any fr-acture of the skull or external sign of serious injury, and usually results from falls upon the back or SI e of the head, often from an inconsiderable height, as when a person s ips su enly up in frosty Aveather and strikes his head on the pavement; the an erioi portions of the hemisj)heres of the brain, or the parts opposite to a stiuck, Avill then be foiuid in the condition just described. he brain and its membranes are often lacerated ly the shariJ spkuta of a cipressectfrcicture, Avhich may penetrate to a considerable depth in its substance Ana lastly, the injury may be occasioned by foreign bodies, such as bullets, < rsnig 01 lodging in the head; or by s/aSsfmfZjwimc/wres through the thinner portions of the skull, especially the orbital plate of the frontal bone.

If the injury implicate those portions of the nervous centre at the base of the brain, the in- tegrity of which is necessary for the proper maintenance of the respiratory act, immediate death must necessarily ensue. If, however, portions of this organ that are less essential to lii'e, as the anterior lobes and upper part of the hemi- spheres, be injured, but very slight symptoms may occur ; and in some cases there is no positive indication by which this injury of the cerebral substance can be determined, except by its exposm'e and escape through the external wmund. Hence, even the Avorst iiijiules of the head are rarely immediately fatal, the patient being seldom killed outright, unless the medulla oblongata or pons Varohi be Avounded. Children, especially, have been known to bear extensive injiu'ies of the brain, and CA'cn the loss of a considerable quantity of cerebral matter, Avithout any very serious effects, either immediate or remote ; and it is by no means imcommon to see them live several days with an extent of injiu’y to the brain Avhich Avould rapidly have proved fatal to an adult. Indeed it may be stated generally, that the younger the patient, the greater the chance of recovery. So, also, the prognosis may be considered more favoiu-able in men of the labommg class, w^hose minds are but little exercised, than in persons of more cultivated intellect. TAvitching of the muscles and epileptiform fits are commonly met Avith Avhen the brain is lacerated and these, compheating coma, or alternating with it, indicate the natme of the mischief. . , , , i i i Foreign bodies even of large size and considerable weight have been lodged for a considerable time AA-ithin the skull, in contact with the brain, AVithout occasioning death. Thus Hennen states that he has seen five cases m av nc bullets were lodged within the skull, that did not prove immediately fatal. Cunningham relates the case of a boy who lived for twenty-four days mth the breech of a pistol, weighing nine drachms, lying on the tentorium, and restuig against the occipital bone. O’Callaghan has recorded the remarkable case of an officer who hved about seven years Avith the breech of a fow ing- piece, weighing three ounces, lodged in the forehead ; the right of the brain resting on the flat part, from which it was only sepiuated by false From the great variety of effects produced by these injimes, it must be CA-ident that there can be no one set of symptoms indicative of wound of t brain proAuded there be no external wound through the cCTcbral substance can be ascertained.

This eftcct of the cerebral lesion, whether it assume the form of paralysis or of convulsions, is alwaj's manifested on the side of the body opposite to that on which the injury to the brain exists ; but not necessarily opposite to that on Avhich the blow has been inflicted on the head ; for the injury to the brain may, by counter-stroke, be in that cerebral hemisphere Avhich is opposite to the side of the head that has been struck. Thus, if a person struck on the right side of the head sustain a ruptime of the middle meningeal artery, and haA'e extrav asation of blood on the right hemis- phere of the brain, he will have hemij)legia on the left side, and vice versa. But, if the blow that is inflicted on the right side were to give rise to extrava- sation by counter-stroke on the left side of the head, the paralysis would develope itself on the side that had been struck. So it is with convulsive movements ; they vdll occur in the arms and legs, on the side opposite to that on which the brain has been injured, whether that injmy be on the side struck from du’ect violence, or on the opposite side from counter-stroke. In this way the hemiplegia may occur on one side, and the convulsions on the other. A man was struck a violent blow on the right temj)le. He was seized with hemiplegia and facial paralysis on the left side, and with convulsive movements on the right side of the face, the right arm, and leg. He died a few days after the injury. On examination, we found a fissure of the right parietal bone, laceration of the middle meningeal artery, and a large clot pressing on the right side of the brain: hence the hemiplegia on the left side of the body. There was laceration with disorganisation of the middle lobe of the brain on the left side : hence the comnlsive movements of the right side of the face, body, and limbs. Saccharine Diabetes is an occasional consequence of injuries of the brain. A man 43 years of age was admitted into Hospital under my care with para- lysis, the lesult of a fall on the back of his head. On examining his urine, it was found to contain sugar in very large quantity. Previously to the accident, he had been perfectly weU and robust; and, as the paralytic symptoms disap- peared, the diabetic sugar gradually lessened in quantity, until it ceased entirely to be formed, and this notwithstanding the continued use of saccharine and amylaceous matter in the food. Claude Bernard has recorded some similar instances in illustration of the interesting physiological fact pointed out y im, that wounds of the central j)ortion of the meduUa oblongata and irrita- tion of the fourth ventricle of the brain in rabbits occasion saccharine diabetes, an indeed, that in the dog artificial traumatic diabetes may be induced by fr-acture of the skull and consecutive iiijiuy of the brain. The Danger of wounds of the brain varies greatly according to the part that IS mjm-ed. It is greatest and most immediate in injuries of the base of the brain, of the pons Varolii, and criu-a cerebri; it is least and most remote w en the upper and anterior part of the hemispheres is the seat of lesion. he Mode of Death after these injuries varies.

The Cerebral Nerves are occasionally injured at their roots, or torn across and detached from their connexion 'with the brain, in injuries of the head. These nerves may be wounded by the same violence that injimes the brain, as when a bullet traverses the head; or they may be detached from their connexion with the brain in laceration of the cerebral pulp ; oi’, lastly, they may be torn across in fracture of the base of the skull, by the fissure extending across the foramen through which the nerve passes. Thus, or from extravasation of blood into its sheath, blindness may result from injury to the optic nerve at any part of its course ; ptosis, and strabismus in different directions, according as the third, the fourth, or the sixth nerve has been injimed. But the nerve that most commonly suffers is the seventh, which, either in its facial or in its auditory portion or both, is not uncom- monly torn across in fractru’es of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, producing either paralysis of the face or deafness. Injury to the eighth nerve is not common, or rather it is not common for patients long to survive who exhibit evidence of the lesion. I have, however, seen repeated vomitings, with palpitations, and a sense of suffocation continuing for months after apparent injury to the origins of the pneumo-gastiic. In other cases, fr-om lesion to the spinal accessory, spasm of the trapezius and steruo-mastoid muscles, simulating tetanus, may set in. Treatment.—In the treatment of injuries of the brain, little can be done after the system has rallied from the shock, beyond attention to strict antiphlo- gistic treatment, though this need not be of a very active kind. In these cases, indeed, as much should be left to nature as possible, the Smgeon merely removing all sources of in’itation and excitement fr’om his patient, and applying simple local dressings. If any foreign body be lodged vdthin the skull, it must of course be removed, if possible. This may be done if it be situated near the external wound, or fixed in the bone ; but if it have penetrated deeply into the substance of the brain, and have gone completely out of reach, it would be perhaps more dan- gerous to trephine the skidl on the chance of reaching it, or m any other way to 0-0 in search of it, than to leave it where it is. Bullets should always be extracted if they can be found. On this point military Surgeons are agreed. If they enter the skull, and strike against and fractiue the opposite side wi - out escaping, should they be sought for ? I think not. arrey anc e , true, have extracted the baU on the side of the head opposite the point ot entrance But it may not be found there.

The period after the receipt of an injury at which this protrusion takes place, varies from a few days—eight or ton—to several weeks. It has been remarked by Guthrie, and the observation has been fully confirmed, that hernia cerebri is more likely to take place through small than largo apertures in the cranial bones. This tiunoiu- increases rather rapidly, pulsates synchronously with the brain, and may shortly attain the size of a hen’s egg, or even become larger (Fig. 251). In its composition and structure it varies. In some instances it is composed chiefly, if not entirely, of extravasated blood ; but the true fungus cerebri is composed of softened and disintegrated cerebral matter, infiltrated with lymph and blood. The softening of the brain, with red discoloration, extends for some little distance under the base of the tumour. The mental condition of the patient is in many cases not much disturbed at first, there being merely some Fig. 251. Hernia Cerebri following Compound Comminuted Fracture of Right Paiietal Bone. degree of cerebral irritation. Speedily, however, stupor comes on, and deat.r eventually occurs from encephalitis, followed by coma, consequent on the inflammatory effusions that take place within the skull. Treatment. The treatment of this complication of fractm’es of the skull is commonly extremely unsatisfactory. If the tumour be shaved off, as is usually recommended, it generally sprouts again until the patient is destroyed by irritation and coma conjoined. In some fortunate cases, however, the removal of the tumour is not followed by its reproduction. All that can be done is to slice off the growth on a level with the brain ; to apply a pledget of dry lint, and a compress^ and bandage over the part, thus allowing it to granulate and the wound to cicatrise. _ Extravasation of Blood within the Skull commonly occurs in all mjimes of the head accompanied by laceration of the brain, and in manyINJURIES OF THE HEAD. 558 of tliosc in which the skull is fractured without that organ being injured. Indeed, when Ave reflect on the great vascularity of the parts Avithin the skidl, the lai'ge sinuses, the numerous arteries that ramify both within the hones and at the base of the brain, and the close vascular netAvork extended over the surface of this organ, avo can easily understand that extravasation of blood is one of the most frequent complications of these injuries and a common cause of death, when they terminate fatally at an early period after their occurrence. Causes.—^Intracranial extravasation of blood may take place either with or AAuthout fr'acture of the skuU. When it is the result of fr’acture, it is in conse- quence of the Assure tearing across one of the meningeal arteries distributed on the inside of the skull, or of a fragment of bone Avounding a sinus or the vascular network on the surface of the brain ; or it may proceed from lacera- tion of this organ breaking doAvn its capillary structm’e. Irr other cases, as in gunshot wourrds, the hremonfrage may be a conseqrrence of wormd of the vessels by the buUet or other foreign body; brrt rt may also be the result of apparently trifling injuries of the head A\dthout bruise or wound ol scalp, or fractrrre of skuU, from the rupture by conerrssion of one of the menmgeal Situations.—The extravasation may occur rn four srtuatrons: 1. ■•^^^een the drrra mater and the skrdl, Avhere it is most cominonly met wrth ; 2.

It is nsnady most considerable when ponred out upon the dura mater, or within the cavity of the arachnoid at the base of the brain. It is in smallest quantity immediately on the Biirface of that or„a , or within its substance.

The patient is concussed or stmmed as usual, after the receipt of a blow on the head ; from this he quickly rallies, and then symptoms of compression set in, and gTadually increase in intensity. He becomes ch-owsy and dull, with a slo-sv and labouring pulse, dilated and sluggish pupils, and a tendency to slow^ respiration ; as the compression increases, complete stupor at length comes on, with stertor in breathing, and there is either general paralysis, or hemiplegia of the side opposite to the seat of injury. ’When the symptoms run this regular course, it is probable that the extrava- sation results from injury of one of the meningeal arteries or large venous sinuses ; that the extravasation is confined to the membranes of the brain ; and that there is no laceration of the substance of this organ. This maybe termed the Meningeal Extravasation ; it most commonly arises from ruptirre of the middle meningeal artery, which, from its situation in a deep canal in the parietal bone, is peculiarly apt to be torn in injiu’ies of the side of the skull. ]\Iore commonly, however, the patient never recovers his consciousness after having been stumied, the symptoms of concussion speedily passing into those of compression. In these cases the paralysis is commonly incomplete, often hemiplegic, and is associated mth twitching of the hmbs or convulsive move- ments of the body generally, and much restlessness with incoherent muttering : the pupils are sometimes contracted, sometimes dilated, and occasionally squint- ing is observed. It is especially when there are convulsions, that the pupils are observed to he in different conditions ; and I have most frequently noticed the pupil dilated on the side that is most convulsed. The extravasation is probably connected with and dependent on laceration or disorganisation of a portion of the brain, and may consequently be termed the Cerebral Extrava- sation. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of these two forms of extravasation from one another is important, as it is in the meningeal only that any operative pro- cedure can be successfully undertaken ; and it may usually readily be effected by attention to the symptoms just detailed. The diagnosis between the compression from extravasation and that from depressed lone or inflammatory effusions ivithin the shidl, is easily made. In the case of depressed fracture, the symptoms of compression continue uninter- ruptedly from the very first, and proper examination of the skull wiU always lead to the detection of the injured bone. When inflammatory effusions, whether of pus, lymph, or seram, exercise undue 23ressiu’e upon the brain, the signs of compression are preceded by symptoms of cerebral inflammation, and arc accompanied by a good deal of pyrexia, by quick piulse and hot skin ; the character of the scalp-wound hkewise, and the separation of the pericranium Avhen pus is effused, enable us to distinguish this condition fr’om that in winch the pressme is the result of extravasated blood. From apoplexy, the diagnosis is not always easily made, more particularly when there is no evidence that the head has been injured. I could give nume- rous instances of this. The follorving will suffice. A man was brought to University College Hospital in a state of profound coma, in which condition ho had been found lying in the street. There was no evidence of injm-y about the head, beyond a bruise, which had probably been rccei^’ed when'he fell. The560 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. case, wliicli was supposed to be one of apoplexy, and ti’eated accordingly, proved fatal in a few hours. On examination after death the skull was found fractured, but not depressed. On the opposite side to the bruise and fracture, a coagulum, weighing nearly four ounces and compressing the brain, lay between the dura mater and bone. In such a case, it is evident that the history can alone alford a clue to its true nature. Even when the head has been injured, it is not always easy. A man was admitted under my care, comatose. A fortnight previously, he had been struck on the left side of the head behind the ear. He Avas stumied, bled freely from the left ear, but then recoAm’ed tolerably, and Avent about his avocations as usual until the day bcfol’e his admission, Avhen he became suddenly comatose. There were stertor, cpiick pulse, and some heat of head; the right pupil was natinal, the left contracted. He was treated anti- phlogistically, but died on the third day. On examination, a fractine on the left side of the skull Avas fomid, extending hito the left internal meatus; on the right side of the head, immediately opposite the fracture and the seat of injury, there was a large coagulum in the caA'ity of the arachnoid, Avith some sero- plastic exudation about it. Here was a meningeal extravasation, the result of contrecoup, existing Avithout symptoms for fomteen days, and' then proving rather suddenly fatal by inflammation. A woman, whilst AA'alking with her sister, fell in the street. She was taken up insensible ; thought to have a fit; became comatose, hemiplegic in the right side, and died the next day. After death the left parietal bone was found fractured, and a clot that weighed five and a half oimces was found lying over the ruptined middle meningeal artery on the dina mater. Or the injury may be so slight as barely to attract attention: a lady going into the opera stumbled as she went down some stahs, and struck the side of her head against the Avail. She felt giddy and confused, returned home, went to bed, Avas fonnd comatose the next day. I was sent for, but before I could trephine her she had died. On examination, a fom-oimce clot was found in the dina mater, under a ruptm-ed meningeal artery, but Avithout fractme. I have seen the same in a boy, who, running doAvn stans to his dinner, struck his head against the opposite wall; he ate his dinner, vomited, became drowsy, and died. A large clot was found in the dma mater at the part struck. In neither of these cases was there any external bruise or other sign of injury. The insensibility of drunlcenmss may usually be distinguished from the coma resulting from injuries of the head, by the absence of local mischief, by the smeU of the breath, and by the face of the di'unkard being flushed and tmgid, and not pale as in a person who is suffering from the effects of a severe injury. When a drunken person has met Avith an injmy of the head and is insensible, he should always be carefully watched, however slight the injury may appcim to be, until sufficient time has elapsed for him to recover from his draiiken fit; as it is impossible to say Avhether the stupor be the result of intoxication, or ot mischief Avithin the skidl; and I have known cases to be sent aivay from hospitals as dimiik, when in reahty the stupor Avas occasioned by depressed ^°ln the stupor from poisoning Ig opium, the condition of the pupils, which arc contracted to the size of a pin’s point, instead of being widely dilated as m coma from cerebral compression, AviU enable the Surgeon to make the diagnosis. I i I561 TREPHINING FOR EXTRAVASATION. The Treatment of extravasation of blood majbe conducted on two principles, either by means of general and local antiphlogistic measm-es,. ha-^ing for their object the an-est of fmther hasmorrhage, the promotion of absorption, and the subdual of inflammatory action ; or else by the application of the treiAine, with the "view of allowng the escape of the eifused blood. The line of treatment to be adopted should, I think, have reference to the character of the symptoms. When these indicate cerebral extravasation, trephining can be of little service, and we must be content with general anti- inflammatory measiu'es; but when the extravasation seems to be meningeal, then an attempt may be successfully made to evacuate the extravasated blood. Although Trephining in cases of extravasation was formerly much in vogue, it is seldom had recourse to by modern Surgeons, and is only proper in the meningeal form of extravasation. It is very true that, if it can be ascertained without doubt that the extravasation is not only meningeal, but that it is so situated that the blood may be removed through the trephine-aperture, and if there be no other serious injiuy to the brain or skuU, the operation should at once be performed. And doubtless cases occasionally happen in which, from the situation of the blow, and perhaps the presence of a capillary fissure over the course of the middle meningeal artery, the gradual supervention of signs of compression after an mterval of consciousness, and the occurrence of hemiplegia on the side opposite to that which has been struck, the Surgeon is warranted in making an aperture in the skull at the seat of injury, in order to remove the blood that has been pom-ed out, and to‘arrest its further effusion. But the instances in which this assemblage of symptoms exist, with sufficient pre- cision to justify an operation, are excessively rare. Out of many hundred cases of serious and fatal injmy of the head that have been admitted into University College Hospital dining the last twenty-eight years, in four cases oidy, I believe, has it been found advisable to have recoinse to trephining for the removal of extravasated blood. In three of these cases death speedily ensued, the coma being unrelieved by the operation. In the fointh case, recoveiy took place. The successful case to which I refer was that of a man admitted comatose, three days after receiving an injury of the head by a faU from a cab. There were no serious symptoms for some hours after the accident; bfit then stupor padually came on, amounting at last to complete coma. On examina- tion, a bruise of the scalp was found on the left temple : through this I made an incision, and, finding a starred fracture over the sinus of the middle menin- geal arteiy, trephined the bone, when a large coagulum was found lying upon ^e dura mater, and, on remoHng this, fluid arterial blood freely welled up. le coma was relieved, and the patient made a good recovery. In fact, in all cases of this kind where there has been a fall or blow on the head, even thouo-h here may be no external marks of violence, the Siugeon should cut down on the skull, and examine it for fracture-to trephine if necessary.

Tn no case would a prudent Surgeon trephine over the coui'se of the middle meningeal artery in the absence of local symp- toms, on the chance of finding the blood there, as has been recommended by some of the older Surgeons. The most serious objection to the application of the trephine in cases of extravasation does not, however, consist so much in the difficulty of determining that blood has been effused within the skull, or that the extravasation is of the meningeal form, as in the difficulty of diagnosing that it is so seated between the diua mater and the skull as to admit of removal; not being effused at the base, nor so widely coagulated over the surface of the brain as to bo unable to escape through the aperture that may be made. The likelihood of the co-existence of fracture of the base of the skull and of lace- ration of the brain, giving rise to the cerebral form of extravasation, must also be taken into accoimt. For these various reasons, Sm’geons now very wisely content themselves, in the great majority of cases of extravasation, with the employment of antiphlogistic treatment, on the principles already stated. The head should be shaved, the ice-bladder apphed, the patient bled, purged, and kept at perfect rest. If, however, the signs be lugent, and pretty clearly indicate the meningeal form of extravasation, and more especially it there be hemiplegia on the side opposite to that on which the blow has been received, with an injury in the course of the middle meningeal artery, the trephine may be applied at the seat of injiuy and the blood removed. The middle meningeal artery will be found at a point one inch and a half behind the external angular process of the frontal bone and from one inch and a half to two inches above the zygoma. A T-shaped incision should be made wth one part paraUel to the zygoma and one at right angles to it, the centre of the vertical uicision being opposite the point above mentioned. The fibres of the temporal muscle ai-e cut through, the bone cleaned, and the crown of a large trephine applied, with the pin of the instrument over the spot where the vessel is supposed to lie. Under this the extravasated blood and the artery Avill be found. OPERATION OP TREPHINING-. Before concluding the subject of injinies of the head, it is necessary to say a few words on the operation of Trephining, which, though far less commonly employed in the present day than heretofore, is one of sufficient frequency, as weU as of great importance from the serious nature of the cases that require it. The operation of trephining may be required for one of the six foUomng 1 Simple depressed fractm-e of the cranium with symptoms of compiession. 2. Compound depressed fractime of the cranium, with or ivithoiit symptoms •of compression. 3. Pimctiu’ed or incised fractiu’e of the cranium. 4. Extravasation of blood between the craniimi anddima mater from iiiptuie of the middle meningeal artery. 5. Intracranial abscess. G. For the removal of a bullet lodged ivithin the ci'anuuii. The trephine may thus be applied to the skull for t e ” itr^con- two principles ; either with the view of preventing inflammation and ts co sequLes, or fcr the purpose of removiug some eause of compressmu. Ihe563 OPERATION OF TREPHINING. onij case in which preventive trephining is practised by modern Surgeons, is that of the puncttired or starred fi-actm-c of the skull, without stupor ; in all other instances in which it is called for, the object of its application is the removal of a cause of compression or of irritation of the brain, such as a de- pressed portion of bone, foreign bodies either fixed in the skidl or lying close luider it, or pus or blood extra^'asated within the cranial cavity. The trephine should have a well-tempered cro^ra, serrated half-way up its exterior ; the teeth should be short and broad, and not too fine ; the centre-pin must not project more than about one-sixteenth of an inch, and care must be taken that the screw which fixes it is in good working order. The other instriunents required are a Hey’s saw, an elevator that will not readily snap, and a pair of strong dissecting-forceps. The operation itself should be conducted in the following way. The head having been shaved, and the iDortion of the skull to which the trephine is to be applied ha'^ung been freely exposed by means of a crucial or T-shaped incision, or by the enlargement of any wound that may exist, the trephine, Avith the centre-pin protruded and well screAved down, is to be firmly apjfiied until its teeth touch the skull (Fig. 252); it is then worked with rather a sharp, light, and quick movement, the pressure being exercised as the hand is carried from left to right. The centre-pin must be -withdrawn as soon as a good groove is Fig. 252.—Application of Trephine.

So soon as 002564 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. it is, he withdraAvs it iu the crown of the trephine, or raises it out Ijy means of the elevator. In this operation the dura mater must not be Avounded ; if it be injured, fatal consequences Avill probably ensue. The ol)jects for Avhich the trephining has been had recourse to must iioaa^ be carried out, depre.ssed bone being ele\’ated or removed, and pus or blood evacuated. The scalp should then be laid doAvn again, a feAV sutures and a piece of Avater-dressing being- applied. There are certain parts of the skull—over the A'enous sinuses, for instance, and near the base—to which no j)rudent Siu-geon Avould apply the instrument. So, also, if it were ever thought necessary to trephine at the frontal sinuses, the outer table must first be removed with a large croAA-n, and the inner table sawn ont AA-ith a smaller one. After the operation, careful attention must be paid to antiphlogistic measm-es of a preventive and cm-ative kind, the gi-eat du-ect danger to be apprehended being inflammation of the brain and its membranes. In some cases, also, there is reason to believe that suppmative phlebitis of the sinuses and veins of the diploe has been the cause of death. The operation of trephining is by no means a favoiu-able one in its results. Of 45 cases reported by Lente, as occiu’ring at the New York Hospital (in which, however, there is no distinction made between the application of the trephine proper and of various instruments, such as the elevator, Hey’s saw, &c., belonging to a trephining case), only 11, or about one-fourth, recovered. Of 17 cases in which the trephine proper was used at University College Hospital, by Cooper, Liston, and myself, 6 patients recovered : 1 other died of injury of the spine unconnected Avith the operation, and the remaining 10 died from various causes. In the late American war, the results have been more satisfactory than the previous experience of Army Surgeons woidd haA'e led us to hope. Of 107 cases of trephinuig, 47 recovered ; and of 114 cases where fragments of bone were removed by the forceps and elevator, Avithout the use of the trephine, 53 recovered. The Parisian Siu-geons have not been very successful. Nelaton says that all the cases of injury of the head, 16 in number, in which the trephine had beeir used in the Parisian hospitals during fifteen years, tenninated fatally. But, although cases in which the trephine is used thus commonly tei-minate fatally, it Avould not be right to atti-ibute the unfavom-able result to the operation itself. In the majority of cases, death results rather fi-om the injiu-y sustained by the brain, from the pressure of extravasated blood at the base, or fi-om encephahtis induced by the cerebral lesion. And, as the cases to which modem Sm-geons now restrict the use of the trephine would necessarily prove fatal if left to themselves, it is but right to give the patient the slender chance of one to three of escaping with life.565 CONCUSSION OF SPINAL CORD. CHAPTEK XXV. —♦— INJURIES OF THE SPINE. IxjUEiES of the spine, like those of the head, derive their importance fi'om the degTee to which the inclosed nervous structures are liable to be implicated. The spinal cord is subject to Concussion, Goinp'ession, and Inflammation, as the residt of external violence ; and any of these conditions may occiu’ without injiuy to the osseous and ligamentous structm’es investing it, although, in the majority of cases, they are directly occasioned by fracture or dislocation of the vertebraj. The cord may also be partially or completely divided by cutting instruments, gun-shot wounds, or broken vertebras. CONCUSSION OF THE SPINAL COBD.* It is by no means easy to give a clear and comprehensive definition of the term. Concussion of the Spinal Cord. This phrase is generally adopted by Smgeons to indicate a certain state of the cord occasioned by external violence ; a state that is independent of, and usually, but not necessaiRy, uncompheated with, any obAuous lesion of the vertebral column, such as fr’actme or disloca- tion ; a condition that is supposed to depend upon a shake or jar received by the cord, by which its intimate organic structine is more or less deranged, and by which its functions are greatly distinbed, and in which various symptoms indicative of loss or modification of inervation are immediately or remotely induced. It appears that Surgeons and writers on diseases of the nervous system have included four distinct pathological conditions mider this one term, concussion of the spinal cord; viz., l._ A jar or shake of the cord, disordering, to a greater or less degree, its functions, without any lesion perceptible to the unaided eye ; 2. Compression of the cord from extravasated blood ; 3. Compression of the cord from inflammatory exudations within the spinal canal, whether of serum, lymph, or pus ; and, 4. Chronic alterations of the structine of the cord itself, as the result of impairment of nutrition consequent on the occurrence of one or other of the preceding pathological states, but chiefly of the third. These various conditions differ remarkably from one another in symptoms and effects, and have only this in common, that they arc not dependent uj)on an obvious external injury of the spine itself; in which respect they differ from the laceration or compression of the cord by the fractine with displacement or the dislocation of a vertebra. Symptoms indicative of concussion of the spinal cord have of late years Iiilurierof tlfp rearter to niy work on “ Concussion of the S))ine, Nervous SI SivciVhere! Nervous System,” Lomlon, 1875, for n more coin]ilete exposition of 1 , and other Obscure subject tliau can beINJURIES OF THE SPINE. 566 liequently occurred, in consequence of injuries sustained in railway collisions, and have been very forcibly brought imder the observation of Surgeons in consequence of their ha^-ing been the fertile sources of litigation ; actions for damages tor injuries alleged to have been sustained in railway collisions ha-ving become of such frequent occuiTence as now to constitute a very important part of medico-legal inquiry. The symptoms that arise from these accidents have been A'ery A'ariously interpreted. Some practitioners have ignored them entirely, believing that they exist only in the imagination of the patient ; or, while admitting their existence, have attributed them to other conditions of the ner^•ous system which could not have arisen from the alleged accident. And when their connection with, and dependence upon, an injmy have been in- contestably proved, no little discrepancy of opinion has arisen as to the ulti- mate result of the case, the permanence of the symptoms, and the cmability of the patient. I cannot too strongly urge the fact that there is in reality nothing special in the symptoms of concussion of the spine produced by railway colli- sions, except in the severity of the accident by which the concussion is occasioned, and that it is consequently a mistake to look on a certain class of symptoms as sjpecial and peculiar to railway accidents. Injimes received on railways may differ in their severity, but do not differ in their natme, fr-om injindes received in the other accidents of ci\il life. There is no more real difference between that concussion of the spine which results from a railway colhsion and that vfhich is the consequence of a fall from a horse or a scaffold, than there is between a compound and comminuted fractm-e of the leg oc- casioned by the giinding of a railway carriage over the hmb and that resulting fr'om the j)assage of the wheel of a cart across it. In either case, the injiuy arising from the railway accident wiU be essentially of the same natme as that Avhich is otherwise occasioned ; but it vdU probably be infinitely more severe and destructive in its effects, owing to the greater degree of violence that occasions it. Concussion of the spinal cord may be produced either by direct violence, as by severe blows or falls on the back, giving rise to local pain and signs of contu- sion, or by shght blows : or by indirect violence, as when a person meets with a general fall, jar, or concussion of the body, without any evidence of a blow having been inflicted on the spine itself; or by hoists and sprains, or vrenches, of the vertebral column. CojfCussiON FROM Direct Violercb.—Concussion or commotion of the spinal cord, as a consequence of severe and direct blows upon the back, has long been recognised and described by those writers who have occupied them- selves with the effects of injmies to this part of the body. The Primary Symptoms of concussion of the cord immediately and directly produced by a severe blow ujion the spine vdU necessarily vary in severity and extent according to the situation of the injiuy, the force ndth which it has been inflicted, and the amoimt of organic lesion that the delicate structiue of the cord has sustamed from the shock or jar to which it has been subjected. A severe blow upon the Upper Cervical Region may produce^ instantaneous death. A less severe blow may produce paralysis of one oi ot all the limbs, with every possible modification of combined or disassociatu loss of motor power and of sensation, of hyperiesthesia and ot ainesthesia.CONCUSSION FROM DIRECT VIOLENCE. 5^7 Or it may g•i^'o rise to A'arions lilienomcna, clepenclent on initation ot the large ncn'es that take their origin from the medulla oblongata. Thus, ■\vhen the vcir/us mrve is affected, a sense of sulfocation, with irregular action of the heart, may be experienced, or severe vomiting may be estabhshed, and may continue for months. Sometimes the s^nnal accessory nerve is affected, and the trapezius or the stcruo-mastoid muscle thrown into a more or less permanent spasmodic state. From irritation of the iTirenic nerve, liiccup and a peculiar sense of constriction round the body, as if the patient were girt by an iron band, may be established. AMicn the Lower part of the Cervical Spine has been struck so as to concuss the cord, I have known, paralysis of one or both arms induced, mthout any paralytic symptoms of the trunk or legs. In these cases the paralysis may go off entirely ; or it may disappear in one arm and continue in the other ; or one nerve only may continue to be affected—such as the circumflex, the musculo- spiral, or the -ulnar. There may be complete paralysis of sensation and of motion in any one of these nerves ; or motor power may be lost, whilst sensa- tion is normal; or, more commonly, where the sensibility continues, it is exalted, and we may find loss of motor power with hyperaesthesia. These modifications of innervation may be confined to one nerve, as the musculo- spiral, when there wiU be loss of motor power in the extensors and supinators of the forearm and hand, with loss of sensation or with hyperaesthesia of the skin of the hand supplied by the radial nerve. In other cases we find motor paralysis of the eirciunfiex or musculo-spiral nerve, and hypera3sthesia of the ulnar-. In these respects there is every possible variety. A severe blow inflicted on the Dorsal or the Lumbar Hegiou may induce more or less complete paraplegia. In some cases the paralysis of the lower- limbs has been complete and instantaneous ; and has affected both sensation and motion, with loss of power over the sphincters. In other cases there has only been paralysis of motion, sensation continuing perfect or being in excess. The reverse has been met with, but less frequently and less completely, there being loss of sensation, and impairment, though not complete loss, of power- over motion. One leg is fi-equently more severely affected than the other. Or the two legs may be imequally affected as to sensation and motion ; both sensation and motion being impaired, but in varying degrees in the two limbs. There may be complete loss of power over the sphineters both of the bladder and anus, with incontinence or retention of lu’ine and farces ; or the loss of power may be confined to the bladder oirly. This is especially the case when there is paralysis of motion rather than of sensation in the low'er limbs. The state of the ru-ine will vary. If there be no retention, it rvill continue acid. AVhen there is retention, the urine usually beeomes tdkaline, but sometimes, oxen when there is complete retention, it remains strongly acid ; and Ollivier noted the very remarkable circumstance in one case of retention, that there was an enonnous formation of inie acid, so that the eathetcr became loaded vith it. Priapism docs not occur in concussion, Avhile it docs so often in cases of laceration and irritation of the cord. paralysed parts is generally notably lower than at of the healthy parts of the body, and in some cases an absence of normal perspiration has been obscrv'cd.568 IN'JUEIES OF THE SPINE. ihe Secondary Symptoms of sovere concussion of fclio spine are usually those of the development ot inflammation in the meninges and in the cord itsell. J-hey consist of pain in some part or parts of the spine, gTcatly in- cicascd by piessiuc and motion, and Tif/uliiii ot the vertebral cohunn, the patient moving it as a whole. The pain is greatly increased by all movements, but especially by those of rotation. It frequently extends as a line down the limbs or as a circle round the body, giving the sensation of a cord tied tightly. If the case go on to the development of acute inflammatory action in the cord and its membranes, spasms of a serious character come on ; at first, usually of the natirre of trismus ; then general spasms of the body and hmbs, mostly followed by speedy death from the exhaustion produced by their repetition. It the inflammation become chronic or subacute, permanent alteratmis in the structure of the cord will ensue, leading to incmable paralytic affections, usually confined to the lower extremities, but sometimes influencing the brain, and associated with great and deep-seated derangement of the general health. White softeninrj of the cord, unassociated with signs of uiflammation of it or its membranes, may be the result of a blow on the back. In this condition paralysis of sensation or motion, often accompained by peculiar rigidity of the muscles, may come on, and ultimately advance to general j)aralysis. Causes of Death.—Concussion of the spinal cord from a severe and direct blow upon the back may prove fatal at very different periods, depending partly on the situation of the blow, and in a gneat measme on the lesions to which it has given rise. Sudden and fatal paralysis has often occurred, without leaving after death any lesion of the cord that coifld be assigned as the cause of death. Abercrombie says, “ Concussion of the cord may be speedily fatal without producing any morbid appearance that can be detected on dissection.” Ami he refers to a case related by Boyer, and fom’ recorded by Trank, in confirma- tion of this remark. In other cases, the fatal result may be occasioned by direct and demonstrable injury of the spine or cord. There appear to be four forms of lesion that will lead to death in spinal concussion from direct severe violence. 1. HgemoiThage within the spinal canal:—a. Between the vertebrae and the dura mater ; h. Between the membranes and the cord; c. In both situations. In these respects, intravertebral extravasations resemble closely those which occiu’ as the result of injury within the cranium. 2. Laceration of the pia mater and hernia of the cord. 3. Extravasation into the substance of the cord. 4. Inflammation, and, perhaps, suppuration of the meninges, mth softening and disintegration of the substance of the cord. This disintegration is, doubt- less, of an acute and probably inflammatory character. Concussion of the spinal cord from a direct and severe injiuy of_ the biick may also teiminate in complete recoveiy after a longer or shortei tune, or in incomplete recovery. The probability of the termination in leco'seiy oes no depend so much on the actual severity of the immediate symptoms that may have been occasioned by the accident, as on their persistence. If they continueIXJUEIES OF SPIFF IN CONCUSSION. 5^9 beyond a certain time, changes wll take place in the cord and its membranes which arc incompatible with the proper exercise of its functions. Injuries of the Vertebral Column in Concussion.—In concussion of the spinal cord, there is, in addition to the lesion of the cord, serious injury inflicted on the ligamentous and bony structures of the vertebral column. This injury, however, must be considered as an accidental complication, as it does not necessarily occasion, or even aggravate, the mischief done to the medulla. Thus the ligaments may be torn through so as to allow partial sepa- ration of contiguous vertebrm ; or, a vertebra may be fractured, but without any displacement of the broken fr-agments, or other sign byAvhich it is possible during life to determine the exact amoimt of injury inflicted on the parts external to the cord. In this respect injuries of the spine closely resemble those of the head ; their chief importance depending on the amount of injmy inflicted upon the contained parts. In the spine, as in the head, it vnW some- times be found after death fr-om Avhat appears to be, and in reality is, simple injury of the nervous centres, that the vertebral column in the one case, and the skull in the other, has suffered an amount of injmy .unsuspected dining life ; and which, though it may not in any way hai’e determined the fatality of the results, yet affords conclusive evidence of the violence to which the parts have been subjected, and the inteiisity of the disorganising shock that they have suffered. There is, however, a very essential difference betiveen the spine and the head. A simple fracture of the cranium may be of no moment, except so far as the A’iolence that has occasioned it may have influenced the brain. In the spine, the case is not parallel; for, as the vertebral column is the centre of support to the body, its function in this respect will be lost when it is broken; even though the spinal cord may not have been injured by the edges of the fractmed vertebrae, but simply violently and fatally concussed by the same force that broke the spine. Boyer noticed the veiy interesting practical fact, that, when the mterspinous ligaments ivere ruptmed in consequence of forcible flexion of the spine for- Avards, no fatal consequences usually ensued, the integrity of the parts being restored by rest; but that, when the ligamenta subflava were torn through, and the arches separated, paraplegia and death folloAA'ed. This he attributed to stretching of the spinal cord. Sh C. Bell, however, Avith great acuteness, has pointed out the error of this explanation, and states that “ it is the progress of the inflammation to the spinal marrow, and not the pressiu’e or the extension of it, which makes these cases of subluxation and breach of the tube fatal.” There can be no doubt that this explanation is the correct one ; and that, Avhen once the spinal canal is forcibly torn open, fatal inflammation Avill spread to the meninges and to the medulla itself. Effects of Slight BIoavs.—The consideration of the effects that may bo produced on the spinal cord by sN^ht diows, Avhethcr applied to the back or to a distant part of the body, has long arrested the attention of observant prac- titioners. Abercrombie, AAU-iting in 1829, says, that chronic inflammation of the cord and its membranes “ may supervene upon very slight injuries of the spine.” He says also, “ Every injury of the spine should be considered as deserving of minute attention. The more immediate cause of anxiety in such570 INJURIES OF THE SPINE. cases IS mflammatoiy action, wliich may be of an acute or chronic kind ; and we hiiYG seen that it may advance in a A’cry insidious manner even after in- juries tliat Avcve of so slight a kind that they attracted at the time little or no attention. isothmgcan be clearer and more positive than this statement, ihese remarks of Abercrombie are confirmed by Ollivier, by Bell, and by other vTitcrs on such injuries. CoJTCussroN FROM INDIRECT VIOLENCE.—There is a class of cases of an extremely insidious and protracted character, in ivhich the patient has received no blow or injury upon the head or spine, but the whole system has had a severe shake or shock, in consequence of which disease is developed in the spinal cord, perhaps eventually extending to the membranes of the brain. These cases are more frequent in railway than in other injuries ; but they occasionally occur in consequence of ordinary accidents. One of the most remarkable circumstances connected ivith injuries of the spinal cord is, the disproportion between the accident and the mischief iiroduced thereby. Not only do most serious, progressive, and persistent symptoms of concussion of the spinal cord often develop themselves after apparently shght injiuies, but frequently when there is no sign whatever of external lesion. The shake or jar inflicted on the spine when a person jumping from the height of a few feet comes to the ground suddenly and heavily on his heels or in a sitting posture, has been ivell knoivn to Surgeons as a not imcommon cause of spinal weakness and debihty. It is the same in railway accidents ; the shock to which the patient is subjected being often followed by a train of slowly pro- gressii’e symptoms, indicatii'e of concussion and subsequent irritation and inflammation of the cord and its membranes. It is worthy of remark, that the symptoms of spinal concussion seldom occur when a serious injury has been inflicted on one of the limbs, unless the spine itself have at the same time been directly and severely struck. A person who by any ordinary accident has one of his hmbs fractm’ed or dislocated, necessarily sustains a veiy severe shock ; but it is extremely rare to find that the spinal cord or the brain has been injuriously influenced. It would appear as if the Auolence of the shock expends itself in the production of the fracture or the dislocation, and that a jar of the more dehcate nervous structiu'es is thus avoided. A familiar illustration of this is afforded in the injury sustained by a watch by faUing on the ground. A watchmaker once told me that, if the glass be broken, the works are rarely damaged ; if the glass escape unbroken, the jar of the fall will usually be fomid to have stojiped the movement. How these jars, shakes, shocks, or concussions of the spinal cord directly influence its action, I caimot say with certainty. When a magnet is struck a heavy blow with a hammer, the magnetic force is jaived, shaken, or concussed out of the iron. So, if the spine be severely jarred, shaken, or concussed by a blmv or shock of any kind communicated to the body, we find that the nervous force is to a certain extent shaken out of the man, and that he has in some ivay lost nervous power. What immediate change, if any, has taken place in the nervous structure to occasion that effect, ive no more knoiv than ivhat change happens to a magnet when struck. Secondary Effects.—'Wliatever may be the nature of the primary change that is produced in the spinal cord by a concussion, the secontlari/ effects arcSECOIS^DARY EFFECTS OF SPINAL CONCUSSION'. sn clearly inflaininatoiy, and are identical with those phenomena that have been described by Ollivicr, Abercrombie, and others, as dependent on chronic meningitis of the coi’d, and snbaente myelitis. One of the most remarkable phenomena attendant upon this class of cases is, that at the time of the occnrrence of the injniy the suflerer is usually quite unconscious that any serious accident has happened to him. The period of the siqoervention of the more serious, persistent, and positive symptoms of spinal lesion will vaiy greatly. Most commonly, after the fii'st and immediate effects of the accident have passed off, there is a period of com- parative ease, and of remission of the symptoms, during which the patient imagines that he will speedily I’egain his health and strength. This period may last for many weeks, possibly for two or three months. Although theie is often this long interval between the time of the occurrence of the accident and the supervention of the more distressing symptoms, it will be found, on close inquiry, that there hcis never heen an interval of complete restoration to health. His friends remark, and he feels that “ he is not the man he was.” He has lost bodily energy, mental capacity, and business aptitude. He looks ill and worn ; often becomes irritable and easily fatigued. He still believes that he has sustained no serious or permanent hurt, and so long as he is at rest, he will feel tolerably well; but any attempt at ordinary exertion of body or mind brings back aU the feehngs or indications of nervous prostration and mitation characteristic of these injiu’es ; and to these vdll gradually be super- added the more serious symptoms which evidently proceed from a chronic disease of the cord and its membranes. After a lapse of several months—from three to six—the patient will find that he is slowly but steadily becoming worse, and he then, perhaps for the first time, becomes aAvare of the serious and deep-seated injmy that his nervous system has sustained. The countenance is usually pallid, sometimes even livid, and has a peculiarly careworn, expressionless look ; the patient generally looking much older than he really is, or than he did before the accident. I have seen, however, instances of flushing of the face. The thoughts are confused. The patient cannot concentrate his ideas so as to cany out a connected line of reasoning ; he attempts to read, but is obliged to lay aside the book or pajDer after a few minutes’ attempt at perusal. All business apititucle is lost; partly from impairment of memory, partly from con- fusion of thought and inability to concentrate ideas for a sufficient length of time. The temper often becomes changed for the worse, the patient being fretful, in’itable, and in some way—difficult perhaps to define, but easily appre- ciated by those around him—altered in character. The sleep is disturbed, restless, and broken. He wakes up in sudden alarm ; di’eams much ; the dreams are distressing and horrible. Ihe head is usually of its natural temperature, but sometimes hot. The patient complains of A'arious uneasy sensations in it; of pain, tension, weight, or throbbing ; of giddiness ; of a confused or strained feeling in it i and fr’e- quently of loud and incessant noises, described as roaring, rushing, ringing, singing, sawing, mmbling, or thundering. These noises vary in intensity at different periods of the day; but, if once they occur, they are ne^•er entirely absent, and are a source of great distress.TNJUIUES OF THE SPINE. 572 rhc ori/ans oj spvcml sense nsnally become more or less seriously allected They become sometimes over-sensitive and in-itable, or their functions are impaucd oi penerted. In many cases we find a combination of all these conditions in the same organ. Vision is nsnally affected in various ways and in j eiy different degrees. In some cases, thongh rarely, there is donblc vision and perhaps slight strabismus. In others there is an alteration in the accom- modation of the eye, so that the patient has to use glasses, or to change those which he has previously worn. The patient cannot read for more than a few minntes, the letters rnnning into one another. More commonly, mnsete voli- tantes and spectra, rings, stars, flashes, or sparks—white, coloin-ed, or llame- like—are complained of. The eyes often become over-sensitive to light; and this intolerance of hght may amount to positive photophobia. It gives rise to a habitually contracted state of the broivs, so as to exclude light as much as possible from the eyes. One or both eyes may be thus affected. This intolerance ^ of light may be associated ivith dimness and imperfection of sight. ^ Vision may be normal in one eye, but impamed seriously in the other. The circulation in the fundus of the eye is visible to some patients. The hearing may be variously affected. Not only does the patient commonly com- plain of the noises in the head and ears that have ah’eady been described, but the ears, like the eyes, may be over-sensitive or too dull. One ear is frequently over-sensitive, whilst the other is less acute than it was before the accident. The relative sensibility of the eai’S may readily be measured by the distance at Avhich the tick of a ivatch may be heard. Loud and sudden noises are pecu- liarly distressing to these patients. Taste and smell are sometimes, but more rarely, perverted. The sense of touch is impaired. The patient cannot pick up a pin, cannot button his dress, camiot feel the difference between different textures, as cloth and verfet. He loses the sense of tveight, and cannot tell, for instance, whether a sovereign or a shiUiug is balanced on his finger. Sveech is rarely affected. The attitude is stiff and unbending. The patient holds himself very erect, usually walks straight forwards, as if afraid or unable to tinn to either side. The movements of the head or trunJc, or both, do not possess their natmal free- dom. There may be pain or difficulty in moving the head in the antero- IDOsterior direction, or in rotating it; or aU movements may be attended by so much pain and difficulty that the patient is afraid to attempt them, and hence keeps the head in an attitude of tmmobihty. The movements of the trunk are often equally restrained, especially in the lumbar region. Flexion for- wards, backwards, or sideways, is painful, difficult, and may be impossible; flexion backwards is usually most complained of. If the patient be desired to stoop and pick anything off the ground, he AviU not be able to do so in the usual way, but bends doAvn on the knee and so reaches the ground. If he be laid horizontally, and told to raise himself into the sitting postmc, without the use of his hands, he will be unable to do it. The state of the sjhne Avill be found to be the real cause of these symptoms. On examining it by pressure, by iDercussion, or by the application of the hot sponge, it will be found that it is painful, and that its sensibility is exalted at one, two, or three points. These me usually the iqApcr cervical, the middle dorsal, and the lumbar regions. The exact vertebras that are affected varySECONDARY EFFECTS OF SPINAL CONCUSSION. 573 necessarily in different cases ; but the exalted sensiljility always includes two, and usually three, at each of these points. It is in consecpience of the pam that is occasioned by any moyenrent of the trunk in the way of flexion or rotation, that the spine loses its natural suppleness, and moves as a whole, as if cut out of one solid pieee, instead of with its usual flexibility. The movments of the head v}wn the xvppci- cervical vertehree are variously aflected. In some cases, the head moves freely in all directions, Avithout pain or stiflPness. In other cases, the gveatest agony is indueed if the Surgeon take the head between his hands and bend it forwards or rotate it; the articulations between the occipital bone, the atlas, and the axis, being evidently in a state of inflammatory in-itation. The pain is usually confined to the vertebral cohmm, and does not extend beyond the transverse processes. But, in some instances, the pain extends widely over the back on both sides, and seems to correspond with the distribution of the posterior branches of the dorsal nerves. In these cases, from the musculo-cutaneous distribution of these nerves, the pain is superficial and cutaneous as well as deeply seated. The muscles of the hade are usually unaffected; but in some cases, where the muscidar branches of the dorsal nerves are affected, they may become very irritable and spasmodically contracted, so that their outlines are very distinct. The gait of the patient is characteristic. He walks more or less unsteadily, generally uses a stick, or if dej)rived of that, is apt to lay his hand on any article of fumitm-e that is near to him, for the purpose of steadying himself. He keeps his feet somewhat apart, so as to increase the basis of support, and consequently walks in a straddhng manner. As one leg is often weaker than the other, he totters somewhat, and raises one foot but slightly off the ground, so that the heel is apt to touch. He seldom drags the toe ; but, as he walks flat-footed as it were on one side, the heel drags. This peculiar straddling, tottering, unsteady gait, vdth the spine rigid, the head erect, and looking- straight forwards, gives the patient the aspect of a man who waits bhnd- folded. The patient cannot generally stand equally well on either foot. One leg usually gives way immediately under him if he attempt to stand on it. He often cannot raise himself on his toes, or stand on them, without immediately tottering forwards. His power of walking is always very limited ; it seldom exceeds half a mile or a mile at the utmost. He cannot ride, even if much in the habit of doing so before the accident. There is usually considerable diffi- culty in going up and down stairs—more difficulty in going down than up. I he patient is obliged to support himself by holding on to the balusters, and often brings both feet together on the same step. A sensation as of a cord tied round the waist, with occasional spasm of the diaphragm, giHug rise to a catch in the breathing, or hiccup, is sometimes met with, and is veiy distressing when it does occur. The nervous power of the limhs will be found to be variously modified, and A\I11 generally be so to very different degrees in the different limbs. Some- times one limb only is affected; in other cases the arm and leg on one side or both legs only, or the arm and both legs, or all four limbs, are the seat o uneasy sensations. There is the greatest possible variety in these respects dependent of course entirely upon the degree and extent of the lesion that lias been mflieted upon or induced in the spinal cord. Sensation or motion574 IlSrJURIES OF THE SPIFfE. only may be afroctecl; or both may be affected, either alike or in imcqual degrees, bensatiou and motion may both be seriously impaired in one limb, or sensa- tion in one and^ motion in another. The paralysis is seldom complete. 11 may become so ni the more advanced stages, after several years ; but for the fii'st year or two it is almost always partial. It is sometimes incompletely recovered from, especially so far as sensation is concerned. The Joss of motor power is especially marked in the legs, and more often in the extensor than in the flexor muscles. The extensor of the great toe is especially apt to suffer. The hand and arm are less frecpiently the seat of loss of motor power than the leg and foot; but the muscles of the ball of the thiunb, or the flexors of the fingers, may be affected. The loss of motor power in the foot and leg is best tested by the application of the galvanic cuirent, so as to compare the irritability of the same muscles of the opposite limbs. The electric test is not under the influence of the patient’s Avill; and a very true estimate can thus be made of the loss of contractility in any given set of muscles. The loss of motor power in the hand is best tested by the force of the patient’s grasp. This may be roughly estimated by telhng him to squeeze the Sm’geon’s fingers, first with one hand and then with the other, or more accurately by means of the dynamometer, which shows on an index the precise amount of pressure exercised in grasping. It is in consequence of the diminution of motor power in the legs that those pecifiiarities of gait which have been above described are met with, and they are most marked when the amoimt of loss is iniequal in the two hmbs. Modification or diminution of sensation in the limbs is one of the most marked phenomena in these cases. In many instances the sensibility is a good deal augmented, especially in the earlier stages. The patient complains of shooting pains down the limbs, like stabs, darts, or electrical shocks. The surface of the skin is sometimes oversensitive in places on the back ; or, in various parts of the limbs, hot, burning sensations are experienced. After a time these sensations give place to various others, which are very differently described by'patients. Tinghng, a feeling of “pins and needles,” a heavy sensation, as if the limb were asleep, creeping sensations down the back and along the nerves, and formication, are all commonly complained of. These sensations are often confined to one nerve in a hmb, as the ifinar or the musculo-spiral. Numbness, more or less complete, may exist independently of, or be associated with, aU these various modifications of sensation. It may be con- fined to a part of a limb, may influence the whole of it, or may extend to several limbs. Its degree and extent are best tested by Brown-Sequard’s testhesiometer. Coldness of one of the extremities, dependent upon loss of nervous power and defective nutrition, is often perceptible to the touch, and may be determined by the thermometer ; but in many cases the sensation of coldness is far greater to the patient than it is to the Surgeon’s hand, and not imfrequently no appre- ciable difference in the temperatiwe of two limbs can be determined by the most delicate chnical thermometer, although the patient experiences a ^•ery distinct and distressing sense of coldness in one limb. The condition of the limbs as to size, and the state of tliecr muscles, vill 'saiy greatly. In some cases of complete paraplegia, which has lasted for j eais, it has been remarked that no diminution whatever has taken place in the size of575 DEVELOrMENT OF SYMPTOMS. the limbs. It is evident, therefore, that loss of size in a limb that is more or less completely paralysed is not the simple consequence of the disuse of the muscles ; or it would always occur. But it must arise from some modification of innervation, influencing the nutrition of the limb, independently of the loss of its muscular activity. In most cases, however, where the paralytic condi- tion has been of some duration, the limb, on acciu’ate measurement, will be found to be somewhat smaller in circumference than its fellow on the opposite side. j\Iost eommonly when a limb dwindles the muscles become soft, and the intermuscular spaces more distinct. Occasionally, in advanced cases, some contraetion and rigidity in particular muscles set in. Thus the flexors of the little and ring fingers, the extensors of the great toe, the deltoid or the muscles of the calf, may all become more or less rigid and eontracted. The lody itself generally loses weight; and a loss of weight, Avhen the patient is rendered inactive by a semi-paralysed state, and takes a fair quantity of good food, which he digests sufiiciently wcU, may usually be taken to bo indicati^'e of progTessive disease in the nervous system. When the progTess of the disease has been arrested, though the patient may be permanently paralysed, a considerable increase of size and weight often takes place. This is a phenomenon of common occurrence in ordinary cases of paralysis from disease of the brain. The condition of the gen.ito-urincmj organs is seldom much deranged in the cases under oonsideration. Eetention of mine very rarely ocem’s. Some- times irritability of the bladder is a prominent symptom. The urine generally retains its acidity, sometimes markedly, at others but very slightly. As there is no retention, it does not become alkaline, ammoniacal, or other- wise offensive. The sexual desire and power are usually greatly impaired, and often entirely lost; not invariably so, however. I have never heard piiapism complained of. The contractifity of the spTiimter ani has not, in any case which I have observed, been so far impaired as to lead to involuntary escape of flatus or of fieces. The pulse v'aries in frequeney at different periods. In the early stages it is usually slow ; in the more advanced it is quick, near to, or above 100. It is always feeble. The Progressive Development of the various symptoms that have just been detailed usually extends over a lengthened period. In the early stages, the chief complaint is a sensation of lassitude, weariness, and inability for mental and physical exertion. Then come the pains, tinglings, and numbness of the imbs; next the fixed pain and rigidity of the spine ; then the mental coll- usion and signs of cerebral distiu’banee, and the affection of the organs of sense ; the loss of motor power, and the pecuharity of gait. ^ It is by^ this chain of symptoms, which, though fluctuating in intensity IS yet continuous and unbroken, that the injury sustained, and the ilhiess siiteequently developed, can be linked together in the relation of cause and effect. _ . ATHOLOGICAL Coifi)iTiojj-s.—Two distinct forms of chronic and subacute in ammation may affect the contents of the spinal canal, as the results of injiuw ^^^fl™^"tion of the Membranes, and Inflammation of theINJUlilJCS OF THE SPINE. 576 Fii Spinal Meningitis, the usual signs of inflammatory action in the form ot vascnlaiisation of tlio membranes ai’e met with. The meningo-rachidian veins aie tuigid with blood, and the vessels of the pia mater are much injected, sometimes in patches, at othei’ times nnitormly. Serous fluid, reddened and clear, or opaque from the admixture of lymph, may be found largely effused in the cavity of the arachnoid. In distinguishing the various pathological appear- ances presented by fatal cases of chronic spinal meningitis, Ollivier makes the very important remark that spinal meningitis rarely exists without there being at the same time a more or less extensive inflammation of the cerebral men- inges ; and hence, he says, arises the difficulty of determining with preci- sion the symptoms that are special to inflammation of the membranes of the spinal cord. When Myelitis ocem’s, the inflammation attacking the substance of the cord itself, the most usual pathological condition met rvith is softening, with more or less disorganisation. This softening of the cord, as a consequence of inflammation, may occupy very varying extents. Sometimes the whole thick- ness of the cord is affected at one poiirt, sometimes one of the lateral halves in a vertical directioir ; at other times the disease is most marked in or whoUy confined to its anterior or its posterior aspect; or the grey central portion may be more affected than the circumferential part. Again, these changes of struc- tiu-e may be limited to one part only, to the cervical, the dorsal, or the lumbar. It is very rarely indeed that the whole length of the cordis affected. The most common seat of inflammatory softening is the lumbar region ; next in order of frequency is the cervical. In very chronic cases of myelitis, the whole of the nervous substance disappears, and nothing but connective tissue is left at the part affected. Ollivier observes that, when myelitis is consecutive to menin- gitis of the cord, the inflammatory softening may be confined to the white substance. Though softening is the ordinary change that takes place in a cord that has been the seat of chi'onic inflammation, sometimes the nervous substance becomes increased in bulk, more solid than natural, and of a dull white coloirr, like boiled white of egg. This induration may co-exist with spinal meningitis, vdth congestion, and increased vascularisation of the membranes. It is important to observe that, although spinal meningitis and myelitis are occasionally met with distinct and separate, yet they most frequently co-exist. "When existina: tosrether, and even arising from the same cause, they may be associated in very varying degrees. In some cases the symptoms of meningitis, in others those of myelitis, are most marked ; and, after death, con’esponding characteristic appearances are found. Impairment of Vision from Spinal Injury.*—One of the most frequent and most troublesome effects of spinal injury is a certain degree of impairment of vision, Avhich assumes different characters, and comes on at very varying periods after the injiiiy. There is often a considerable inten-al intervenes between the occurrence of the injury and the development of the eye-symptoms ; and, if the patient be confined to bed, and be not called upon to use his eyes, it may be • For a fuller consideration of the sul.jeot of tSrSIlne'" Nervous System, I would refer iny reader to Lecture 10, Concussion of the &i no, j J.ouginans, 1875.IMPAIRMENT OF VISION FROM SPINAL INJURY. 577 long before lie discovers that their sight is enfeebled. This is more especially apt to be the case, as the attention of the Surgeon may not be directed to the state of the eyes in the first instance. The first and most frequent sjmiptom that is complained of is a dimness or iveakness of the sight, so that the patient cannot define the outlines of small objects, and cannot sec in an obscure light. If he attempt to read, he can define the letters often of the smallest print for a few seconds or minutes, but they soon run into one another, become obscured and blurred, and ill-defined. Glasses do not materially, if at all, im- prove tliis condition. There is often in the early stages some slight in-egu- larity in the axis of the eyes, scarcely amounting, however, to a squint. This bliuTing, or indistinctness of vision, is often more marked with respect to near than to distant objects. After a time the patient usually suffers from irritabi- lity of the eyes, and cannot bear a strong light, even that of an ordinary window, in the daytime, or unshaded gas or lamphght. In consequence of this in-itability of the eyes, the brows become involuntarily contracted, and the patient acquires a j)eculiar frown so as to exclude light as much as possible. This intolerance of light may amoimt to perfect photophobia, and is then associated ivith congestion of the conjunctiva and accompanied by lachiyination. One or both eyes may be thus affected. Sometimes one eye only is intolerant of light. This intolerance of light is usually accompanied by muscEe voli- tantes and spectra, rings, stars, spots, flashes, and sjDarks, or an appearance of white-coloured flame. The appearance of a fixed luminous spectrum, a line, ■ciicle, or coloured bar across the field of vision, is sometimes complained of. There is an undue retention of the image in many cases ; and where the patient has looked at any fixed object, such as the sim or the fii’e, complemen- taiy spectral colours, often of the most beautiful character, of varying degrees of intensity, ivill develop themselves in succession. The patient is^in some eases conscious of the circidation in his own eye, which becomes distinctly rfsiblc to him, even in its pulsatory character. From this description of the symptoms of the impairment of vision that follows spinal injury, it would appear that it is of five distinct kinds, ivhich may, however, be associated : 1. Asthenopia, or simple weakness of sight • -. Amblyopia, a paresis of the optic nerve or retina ; 3. Loss or faihue of the power of accommodation; 4. Inltabihty of the eye and photopsia fr-omliyperiemia or inflammation of the optic nerve and retina, which may lead to, 5. Atrophy of the optic nerve.

Sooner or later, bowever, wliether as the result of primary changes in the fundns, or more slowly from the effect of a slowly progressive infiaumia- tory affection propagated from the intracranial portion of the nervons appa- ratus towards its periphery, and thus inducing morbid changes in the optic aierve and its disc, Ave find that the ophthalmoscope reveals changes in the fundus of the eye. “ The disc,” says Wharton Jones, “is seen to be Avhitish and somewhat congested; the retinal veins are large, though the fundus usually presents an anmmic aspect, Avith perhaps some pigmentous degenera- tion of the retina round the disc.” One or other of these conditions occurs in the majority of cases of spinal injury. Allbutt says, “ It is tolerably certain that disturbance of the optic disc and its neighbom-hood is seen to folloAV disturbance of the spine, Avith sufficient frequency and uniformity to establish the probability of a causal relation between the two events.” He goes on to say that in 13 cases of chronic spinal disease folloAving accident, he found 8 cases of sympathetic disorder of the eye. My experience fully accords Avith that of Allbutt. I find that of GO cases of obscure spinal injiuy, Avithout fractiue or dislocation, that I have consecutively examined, there was impairment of Ausion in 42 instances. Allbutt makes the interesting remark, Avhich will be supported by the experience of all Surgeons, that, in the severer forms of spinal injury, those that prove fatal in a few weeks, evidences of eye-disease are not met A\dth. Of 17 such cases he found no evidence of eye-disease in any one instance. This obseiwation affords a most complete answer to an objection that has often been lu’o-ed, that as sympathetic affection of the eye is rarely met udth in severe injuries of the spine, such as fractiues and displacement of the vertebra; Avith traumatic lesion of the cord, its occurrence in the less immediately severe and more obsciue forms of injury can scarcely be looked upon as the direct result of the spinal mischief. It would appear, however, from the observations ot AUbutt, Avhich I can entirely confirm, that it is in these very cases that it is met AAuth. , . ■ n XI,., That a certain portion of the spinal cord exercises a direct mfiuence on the eyes, has been incontestably established by the experiments of modern physio- loo-ists. Budge and Waller, in 1851, demonstrated that the filaments of the sympathetic that supply the eye take their origin ft-om that part of the spii^ cOTd^ which is contiguous to the origin of the first pair of dorsal iicives an that the portion of the spinal axis Avhich extends fi-om the fifth sixth dorsal vertebra, and, accorchng to Brown-Sequard, as dorsal, possesses a distinct influence on the organs of vision physiologists it has been termed the “ ciho-spmal,” and by C lai de^cinaid t o “ ociilo-spinal ” axis. It has been determined as the result ot niimaoi experiments, that the partial clmsion of this eilio-spinal axis exeveises OTious disturbing inteiioes on the sixe of the pupils on the Tasenlai;|s,to coniunetila, and probably of the deeper oenlar tissues, and ^ ^ “ Jilood-vesseU of fbe ear, exactly similar to those that ore occasioned b) thentPAIRMENT OF VISIOFT FROM SPINAL INJURY. 579 section of the cervical sympathetic. The conclusion that must necessarily he detluced from these observations is, that this portion of the spinal cord— the oculospinal axis — includes Avithin itself both vaso-motor and oculo- piipillary filaments Avhich are connected Avith the cervical portion of the sympathetic. Claude Bernard has pointed out clearly the feet that the vaso-motor and the oculo-pupillary ncrA'cs possess different reflex actions. By dividing the firet two dorso-spinal roots, he finds that the oculo-pupillar phenomena are produced A\-ithout occasioning the vaso-motor effects of Avascular injection and increase of temperature ; Avhereas, by dividing the ascending sympathetic filament betAA'een the second and third ribs, the vaso-motor phenomena are developed in the head Avithout any influence being excited on the eye through the medium of the oculo-pupillary filaments. He sums up his observations as folloAvs. “ The vaso-motor and the oculo-pupillary nerves do not act in the same AA'ay. Thus a slight irritation of the auricular nerve only occasions A-ascularisation on the coiTesponding side ; whilst the same imtation produces reflex moA ements in both eyes at the same time. The reflex vascular actions do not appear to be capable of being produced on the opposite side to that Avhich IS imtated (d’lme maniere crois^e) ; and, besides this, they are limited and do not extend beyond a certain determined line of circumscription. All this IS in striking contrast with the oculo-pupiUar actions, which are on the contraiy general and crossed.” Clinical observations support the result of physiological experiment as to the connexion that subsists between the oculo-spinal axis of the cord and the inte^fly of Aisiou. The records of surgery contain numerous illustrations of the injiirious influence on the sight of bloAvs inflicted on the lower cervical and upper dorsal spine. .

From the secondary effects of cerebral concussion it is not difficult to diagnose the consequences of concussion of the s])inal coi-d, in those cases in which the mischief is limited to the vertebral column, d'hc tenderness and rigidity of the spine, the pain on pressing upon or on moving it in any direction, and the absence of any distinct lesion about the head, will sufficiently mark the precise situation of the injury. The two conditions of cerebral and spinal concussion often co-exist primarily. The shock that jars injuriously one portion of the irervous system, very commonly produces a corresponding effect on the whole of it, on the brain as Avell as on the cord ; and the secondary inflammations of the spine, which follow the concussion, even when that is primarily limited to the ^ ertebral column and its contents, have a tendency to extend along the continuous fibrous and serous membranes to the interior of the cranium, and thus to give rise to symptoms of cerebral irritation. _ 2. From rheumatism the diagnosis may not always be easy, especially in the earlier stages of the disease, when the concussion of the spine and the consecutive meningitis have developed pain along the com-se of the nerves, and increased cutaneous sensibility at points. By attention, however, to the histoiy of the case, the gradually progvessive character of the symptoms ^ of spinal concussion, the absence of aU fixed pain except at one or more pomts in the back, the cerebral complications, the gradual occiin-ence of loss of sensibility of tinglings and formications, the slow supervention of impairment _ or loss ot motor power in certain sets of muscles (symptoms that do not occm in rheuma- tism), the diagnosis iviU be rendered comparatively easy ; the more so n hen we observe that in spinal concussion there is never any concomitant articu ai inflammation, and that, although the urine may continue acid, it does not usuallv show a superabundance of hthates. 3 Hysteria is the disease for which I have more frequently seen concussion of the Tine, followed by nieningo-myelitis. mistaken; and it has a ways appetod extraordinary to me that so great an error of dia|iMis ™ ' made Hysteria, whether in its emotional or its local foim, s a disease ot Ten rXr thLii of men, of the young rather than of the middle-apd and bj T-ntinned and complete intermissioim of.ts — ilno way resembles whid we ble to cail consecutive menmgo-myelitis , c (.-vp In mind -icciistomed to self-control, a case one of hysteria in which a man devoted to affected by a train of symptoms indi- infliction ot a severe shock, tiii _ ^ npvvoiis svstem.

That mental emotion is occasionally manifested by an unfortunate individual Avho has been seriously iujmed by an aecident Avhich tends to shake his Avhole nervous system, can scarcely be matter of siu|)rise ; but the term ‘"hysteria,” elastic as it is, cannot, it appeal’s to me, be strained so far as to include this condition ; and even if it be considered applicable to the patient’s mental state, it can in no Avay be looked upon as the cause of those bodily sufferings and disabilities Avhich constitute the most important and serious part of the disease. Prognosis.—The prognosis of concussion of the spinal cord and that of the consecutive meningo-myelitis is a question of extreme interest in a medico- legal point of viev", and is often involved in much difficulty. The prognosis requires to be made with regard, first to the life, and secondly to the health of the patient. So far as life is concerned, it is only in cases of scA'crc and direct blows upon the spine, in which intraspinal hmmoiThage to a considerable extent has occuiTed, or the cord or its membranes have been ruptured, that a speedily fatal termination may be feared. In some of the cases of concussion of the spine, followed by chronic inflam- mfrtion of the membranes and of the cord itself, death may supervene after several, perhaps three or four, years of an increasingly progressive breaking- down of the general health, and the slow extension of the paralytic symptoms. I haA'e heard of several instances in which concussion of the spine has thus proved fatal some years after the occiurence of the accident. I have neA’er knoAvn a patient recover Avho has been attacked by convulsions, progressive paralysis developing itself, and the case ultimately proving fatal. Gore, of Bath, informs me that he is acquainted Avith two cases which proved fatal at long periods of time after the accident, in both of Avhich this symptom AA’as present. Concussion of the spine may prove fatal: first, at an early period by the se\'erity of the direct injury ; secondly, at a more remote date by the occun’ence of inflammation of the cord and its membranes ; and, thirdly, after a lapse of sevei’al years, by the slow and progressiv’e development of structiu'al changes in the cord and its membranes. If death do not occiu’, is recovery certain ? Is there no intermediate state betAAcen a fatal result, proximate or remote, and absolute and complete recovci’}'- ? In considering the question of recovery after concussion of the spine, we have to look to two points : first, the recovery from the primary and direct effects of the injury ; and, secondly, the recovery from the secondary and remote con- sequences. I here can be no doubt that recovery, entire and complete, may occur in a case of concussion of the spine, Avhen the symptoms haA’e not gone beyond the primary stage, Avhen no inflammatory action of the cord or its membranes has been developed, and more particularly Avhen the patient is young and healthy. This last condition indeed is most important. A healthy yomig man is not only less likely to suffer from a severe shock to the system rom a fall or railAvay injuiy than one more advanced in life ; but, if he do su er, his chance of ultimate rocoA'ory Avill be greater, provided always that no secondary and organic lesio,^ have developed them^es I btS to582 INJURIES OF THE SPINE. sucli recovery is more likely to ensue if tlie primary and direct symptoms Lave been scs'ere, and have at or almost immediately after the occiUTencc of the accident attained to their lull intensity. In tliese eases, under projoer treat- ment the severity of the symptoms gradually subsides, and, week by week, the patient feels himself stronger and better, until, usually in from three to si.v months at the utmost, all traces of the injury have disappeared. Incomplete or partial recovery is not nnfrecpient in cases of severe and direct injury of the spine. The patient slowly recovers up to a certain point and then remains stationary, with some impairment of innervation in the shape of partial paralysis of sensation or of motion, or both, usually in the lower limbs. 'J’hc intellectual faculties or the organs of sense are more or less distiu-bcd, weakened, or irritated, the constitution is shattered, and the patient presents a prema- turely Avorn and aged look. In such cases structm-al lesion of some kind, in the membranes, if not in the cord, has taken place, Avhich necessarily must prevent complete recovery. When, therefore, we find a patient who, after the receipt of a severe injury of the spine by Avhich the cord has been concussed, presents the primaiy and immediate symptoms of that condition, we may entertain a favourable opinion of his future condition, provided there be a progressive amelioration of his symptoms, and no evidence of the development of any inflammation, acute or chronic, of the membranes of the cord. But our opinion as to his idtimate recovery must necessarily be very uutavoiu-able if the progress of amendment cease after some Aveeks or months, leaving a state of impaired innervation ; the more so if^ subsequently to the primary and immediate effect of the injmy, symptoms of meningo-myelitis haA'e declared themselves. In such circum- stances partial restoration to health may be looked for, but complete recovery is scarcely possible. When a person has received a concussion of the spinal cord from a jar or shake of the body, Avithont any direct blow on the back, or perhaps on any other part of the body, and the symptoms have progressively developed them- selves, the prognosis Avill always be very unfavom-able ; for this reason, that, as the injmy is not sufficient of itself to produce a direct and immediate lesion of the cord, any symptoms that subsequently appear must be the residt of structural changes in it consequent on its inflammation ; and these secondary strnctural changes, being incmable, must to a greater or less degree, but pei- manently, injmiously influence its action. For the same reason, the occinrence of a lengthened interval, a period of several weeks for instance, between the infliction of the injury and the development of the spinal symptoms, is pecir- harly unfavoinable. In forming an opinion as to the patient’s probable futine state, it is of far less importance to look to the immediate or early seA'crity of the symptoms than to their progressive and insidious development. The time that the symptoms have lasted is necessarily a most important matter for consideration. When they have been of but short duration, they may possibly be dependent on conditions that are completely, and perhaps easily remoA'able by proper treatment; tor instance, on extravasation ot blood, or on acute serous inflammatory cflusion. But when the symptoms, however slight they may be, have continued even without progressive increase, but haAC merely remained stationary for a lengthened period of many months, theyTREATMEXT OF EFIXAL GONCUSSTOX. 583 will muloubteclly be found to be depcndeiit on those secondary structural changes that follow inflammatory action. I have never known a j^atient to recover entirely, so as to be in the same state of health that he enjoyed before the accident, in whom the symptoms dependent on chronic inflammation of the cord and its membranes, and on their consecutive structural lesions, had existed for twelve months. And though, as Ollivier has observed, such a patient may li\-e for fifteen or twenty years in a broken state of health, the 2)robability is that he will die within three or four. There is no structure of the body in which an organic lesion is recovered from with so much difficulty and with so gveat a tendency to resulting impairment of function, as the spinal cord and brain. And, with the exception probably of the eye, there is no part of the body in which a slight permanent change of structure jwodnees such serious distinbance of function as in the S2>inal cord. Treatment.—The general princij)les of treatment of concussion of the S2>inal cord are the same, from whatever cause the injury may have arisen. In the Early Stages of a case of Concussion of the Spine, the first thing to be done is undoubtedly to give the injured jjart com^olete and abso- lute rest. The importance of rest cannot be over-estimated. Without it, no other treatment is of the slightest avail; and it would be as irrational to attempt to treat an injimed brain or a sj)rained ankle without rest, as to try to benefit a patient suffering from a severe concussion or wrench of the sjoine un- less he be kept quiet. It is the more imjDortant to insist nj)on absolute and entire rest, for the reason, that not unfrequently j)atieuts feel for a time bene- fited by movement; and hence changes of air and scene are thought to be permanently beneficial. But nothing can be more erroneous than this idea, for the patient wll invariably be found to fall back into a worse state than had pre'S'iously existed. In more advanced stages of the disease, when chronic meningitis has set in, the patient suffers so severely fr-om any, even the very slightest movement of the body, that he instinctively preserves that rest which is needed. In order to secure rest efficiently, the patient should be made to lie on a jiroiie couch. In the prone j)osition, the sj)iue is the highest jjart of the body ; thus passive venous congestion and determination of blood, which are favoimed when the patient lies on his back, are entfrely prevented. Again, the absence ■ot pressure upon the back is a great comfort when it is unduly seusitfr'e and tender, and is a soiu'ce of additional safety to the j)atient, if he be jjarajAegic, by levelling the liability to the formation of bed-sores. Lastly, the prone 2)osition presents this ad's'antage over the suj)ine, that it allows the ready ajo^ffi- cation of local treatment to the sj)ine. In some instances complete and absolute rest may be secured to the injined spine by the application of a gutta-percha case to the bsick, embracing the shoulders, nape, and back of the head ; or by lotting the patient wear a stiff collar, so as to gi'S'c supjDort to the neck. But, if rest is needed to the sjn'ne, it is equally so to the brain. In cases of concussion of the spine, the membranes of the brain become liable to the exten- sion ot inflammatory action to them. The irritability of the senses of siofrt and hearing, that is very marked in many of those cases, with perliaps heat^of lead or flushings of the face, gives the best evidence of this morbid action. For t le subdual of this state of increased cerebral excitement and irritability, it isINJURIES OF THE SPINE. 584 •absolutely necessary that the mind should bo kept as much as possible at rest. Iho patient, feeling hiinselt unequal to the fatigue of ljusiness, becomes conscious of the necessity of relinquishing it, though not perhaps Avithout great I’cluctanco, and until after many ineffectual efforts to attend to it. There are two remedies Avhich may be employed Avith much advantage in the earlier stages of spinal concussion, Avith the A'icAV of soothing the irritation of the iierA'ous system. One is cldoral-hydi’ate, to procure sleep ; the other, bromide of potassium, to allay irritability. During the early period of concussion of the spine, much advantage will usually be derived from dry cuijping along the back on each side of the verte- bral column. In some cases, I have seen good efPects follow the application of ice-bags to the injured part of the spine. At this period, I believe, medicine is of little sei’vice, beyond such as is required for the regulation of the general health on ordinary medical principles. I^Tien the Secondary Effects of Concussion of the Spinal Cord have appeared, much may often be done not oidy for the mitigation of suffering, but for the cm-e of the patient, by carefully conducted local and constitutional treatment. Rest, as in the early stages, must be persevered in ; but, in addition to this, counter-irritation may now be advantageously employed. The various forms in Avhich this means is familiar to the Surgeon—stimulating embro- cations, mustard poultices, blisters, and setons or issues—^may be successively used. With regard to internal treatment, I know no remedy in the early period of the secondary stage, when subacute meningitis is beginning to develoj) itself, that exercises so marked or beneficial an influence as the perchloride of mercury in tincture of quinine or of bark. I have seen this remedy produce the most beneficial effects, and have known patients come back to the Hospital to ask for the “ perchloride ” as the only medicine from Avhich they had Rerived advantage. At a more advanced period, and in some constitutions in which mercury is not Avell borne, the iodide or the bromide of potassium in full doses will be found highly beneficial, more especially Avhen there are indications ot the presence and the pressure of inflammatory effusion. When aU signs of inflammation have subsided—A\hen the symptoms have become those of paralysis, whether of sensation or of motion—but more espe- cially in those cases in AAhich there is a loss of motor power, Avith a generally debilitated and cachectic state, cod-hver oil, stiychnine, and iron may be advantageously employed. But I would j>articularly caution against the use of these remeches, and more especially of strychnine, in all those cases in which inflammation is still existing, or diu’ing that period in any case in which there are evidences of this condition. In such circumstances the admi- nistration of strychnine is attended by the most prejudicial effects, increasing materially and rapidly the patient’s sufferings. But in the absence of inflfmi- matory irritation it Avill, if properly administered, be found to be most usefiil, more particularly in restoring lost motor power. In those cases m which strych- nine may be advantageously administered, great benefit will also be derived from Avarm salt-Avatcr douches to the spine, and gah anism to t le im is. At a more advanced period, Avhen general cachexy has een iiu uce , am585 WOUNDS OF THE SPINAL CORD. more or less paralysis of sensation and motion continues in the limbs, and nothing of a specific nature can be done in the way of treatment, our Avhole object should be to improve the general health on ordinary medical principles, so as to prevent as far as possible the development of secondary diseases, such as phthisis dependent on malnutrition and a generally broken state of health, which may after several years lead to a fetal termination. WOUNDS OF THE SPINAL CORD. These injuries may occur from stabs with pointed instruments ; from gun- shot violence ; or, most frequently, from the pressure of fractured -s'ertebra). In the latter form of injury there is an association of wound and compression, giving rise essentially to the same symptoms as if the cord were difeded. Symptoms.—IVhen the spinal cord is com2Aetehj clwided, certain symptoms occur that arc common to all cases, at whatever part of the cord the injury has been inflicted, provided it be not so high as to cause instant death. In the fiist place, there is mivpMa iKiraUjsis of sensation and motion in all the parts below the seat of injury, though the mental state of the patient continue intact. The precise seat of injury may often be diagnosed by the extent of the paralysis. In injury of the loAver part of the spine, there may be paralysis of all the parts supplied by the nerves of the sacral plexus, Avhilst those from the lumbar are not affected ; the sensibility being lost beloAV the knees, whilst aboA'e it is perfect—thus leading to the inference that the injury has been inflicted above the one and below the other set of nerves. When the paralysis is complete, the temperature below the seat of injury is loiveredy often considerably, so as to give a sensation of distinct coldness to the hand. This is also the case when the paralysis is partial, provided there be no sign of laceration of the cord. In cases of laceration a considerable rise of temperatme has sometimes been obsei'A'ed, even as high as 114° F.; and after a time, a Aisible diminution takes iilace in the nutritive activity of the limhs, the circulation becoming feeble AA'ith a tendency to congestion at depending points. The lessening of nutritive vigour is not confined to the paralysed parts, but affects the whole system, the patient becoming speedily emaciated, auccmic, and cachectic. ^ I he skin assumes a dirty, cadaverous hue, and the cuticle usually exfoliates in bramiy flakes. The loAA ering of the temperature, the disturbance in the processes of nutri- tion and secretion, and the supervention of emaciation and cachexy, aro ependent upon a derangement of the relations of the A'aso-motor system and the spinal cord. This derangement does not altogether arise from the simple ^ iAision of the cord, but is rather the consequence of the inflannnation set up. m it and its membranes by the injury, and is, therefore, aggravated by anything that increases the inflammation ; thus it is more marked in laceration 0 t e cord and its continuous irritation by a fractured spine, than after its simple diAosion Avith a cutting instrument. Ihe general symptoms of paralysis following injury present important lof 1 cations, according to the height at Avhich the cord is divided. 3. \\hen the injury has been inflicted in the Lumbar or Lower Dorsal O o« ftom tho sticrel ov liuiibiir iilexnsc.9, or both of tho lower oxtro-INJUUIES OF THE SPINE.

Iheic is always relaxation ot the sphincter ani, rvith consequent inconti- nence of flatus, and, to a great extent, of fteces. Tlicre is at first, reten- tion of inine in consequence of the paralysis of the bladder, which is unable to expel its eontcirts ; after a time, however, the urine dribbles aw'ay as fast as it is poured into the overdistended organ, the neck of which has lost its contractile sphincter-like action. The reason why there are incontinence of faeces and retention of urine in these cases, is this. The sphincter ani and the muscular fibres of the Idadder are both voluntary and under the influence of the spinal system, "When paraplegia exists, the restraining power of the .sphincter ani and the expelling power of the bladder are both lost. Hence the bladder cannot expel its contents : wlule the anus cannot retain those of the intestines, Avhich are brought down to it by the peristaltic movements Avhich are not spinal, but under the influence of the sympathetic nciwous system. After the first few" days the urine becomes ammoniacal in odour, tuid alkaline in reaction. This is iwobably owdng to changes that it undergoes after it has passed into the bladder, the mucous membrane of Avhich becomes chronically inflamed, secreting a viscid alkaline muco-pus, Avhich mixes A\ith the urine. In the early stages of the accident, the penis Avill usually be obseiwcd to be in a state of semi-erection. Patients w'ho have met Avith injiu’ies of this portion of the spinal cord may live on for many months, and eA'en for ■a year or tAvo, falling into a cachectic state, but eA'entually die, usually Anth sloughing of the nates, or from the supervention of some interciurent visceral inflammation of Ioav type. 2. When the cord is diA'ided in the Upper Dorsal Region, about the level ■of the third doi'sal A'ertebra, avc have not only the train of symptoms that haA'e just been mentioned as characteristic of this injury low^er down, but the respi- ration also is interfered Avith in consequence of the paralysis of the greater qjortioii of the expiratory muscles. The intercostal muscles, and those con- stituting the abdominal AvaU, no longer acting, imperfect expiration is solely olfected by the elasticity of the Avails of the chest ; and the pmnly musciflar expiratory movements, such as sneezing and coughing, cannot be accomplished. In these cases, during inspiration, which is efiected almost exclusiA'ely by the diaphragm, the ribs are depressed instead of being expanded and raised ; and the abdominal AvaU, Avhich is soft and flaccid, is protruded far beyond its normal limits. In consequence of the impediment to respiration the blood is not properly arteriahsed, and slow asphyxia goes on, usually running into congesth'e pneumonia, and terminating fatally in about a fortnight or three AA'eeks. 8. WTaen the injury is situated in the Lower CerAdcal Region, not only do all the preceding symptoms occiu, but there is paralysis of the iqApei extremities as Avell; and,’ the inspiration being entirely diaphragmatic, the circulation speedily becomes affected, the lungs surcharged and cedematous, the countenance assuming a sulfused and purplish look. If the coid uiac been divided immediately aboA'e the brachial plexus, there will be complete paralysis of the Avhole of the upper extremities ; but if the injury be opposite the sixth cervical A'ertebra, they may be only partially paralysed. I is laji pened in two cases of fracture of the spine in this region that weie some jeaisSFIiAhYS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUAIN. 587 ago under my care at the Hospital. In both, the paralysis existed on the ulnar hut not on the radial side of the arms, owing to the external cutaneous median and museulo-spiral ner\-es arising higher from the plexus than the ulnar, and thus just escaping injury. It is remarkable that, in both these cases, there was acute cutaneous sensibility in the arms along the Avhole line of junction between the paralysed and the sound parts. There is this remarkable fact connected with injuries of the Imver portion of the cervical spinal cord, that the temperature below the seat of injury often rises very considerably—to a higher point, indeed, than is noticed in any other surgical affection. Brodie found in one case that the thermometer marked 111° F. But in other cases again the tem- perature has been found greatly reduced, not more than 81° to 82° F. In cases of injury of the cord in this situation, death usually occurs by asphyxia in the coiu-sc of from 48 hours to a Aveek. 4. When the diA'ision of the spinal cord takes place above the Origin of the Phrenic Nerves opposite to or above the third cervical vertebra, instan- taneous death results from the paralysis of the diaphragm, as well as of the rest of the respiratory muscles, inducing sudden asphyxia. It necessarily happens in partial diArision of the cord, that the symptoms are not so clearly marked as in the instances that haA'e just been recorded. Thus, for instance, the paralysis may not extend to all the parts beloAV the seat of injiuy ; it may be attended by severe pain in some of the semi-paralysed parts ; or motion may be affected in one limb, and sensibihty in another. These dcAuatious may generally be explained by some peculiarity in the seat of the injury to the cord, or by the extent of its division. MECHANICAL INJUBIES OF THE VEBTEBEAL COLUMN. The mechanical injuries to which the vertebral column is liable, consist of (Sprains or Wrenches, Fractm’e, and Dislocation. Twists, Spraixs, or Wrenches oe the Spine, without fracture or dislo- cation of the vertebrm, may occur in a variety of Arrays. Boyer relates a fatal case, occiu-ring from an injiuy receWed in practising gymnastics. Sir A. Cooper giA'es an instance of a fatal AA'rench of the spine, frum a rope catching a boy round the neck whilst SAvinging. In tAvo cases, the injiuy also arose from A'iolence applied to the cervical spine ; in one from a railway accident, in the other from a fall from a horse. These Avrenches of the spine are, frum obvious reasons, most liable to occiu in the more mobile parts of the A'ertebral column, as the neck and loins, just ahoA'e the sacral region ; less fr’equently in the dorsal region. In railway collisions, Avhen a person is violently and suddenly jolted from one side of the carriage to the other, the head is frequently forcibly throAvn forAvards and backwards, moving as it Avere by its OAvn AAeight, the patient having for the time lost control over the muscidar structures of the neck. In such cases the patient complains of a seA'erc straining, aching pain in the aiticulations between the head and the spine, and in the Cer-vical Spine ffself. ^ Phis pain closely resembles that felt in any joint after a severe AATcnch o Its ligamentous structiues, but is peculiarly distressing in the spine, owim>- 0 he extent to which fibrous tissue and ligament enter into the compositionJNJUlilES OF THE SPINE. 588 ot the column. Ifc is gi'cafcly increased by to-and-fi'o mo\'ements, however sliglit, and especially by rotation ; also by pressure upon, and by lifting i;p the head so as to pnt the tissues on the stretch. In consecpionco of this, the patient keeps the neck and head immoA'able, rigid, looking straight forwards. He cannot raise his head off a pillow without the assistance of his own hand, or that of another person. d'ho Lumbar Spine is often strained in railway collisions, with or without similar injury to the cervical portion of the column, in consequence of the body being forcibly swayed backwards and forwards during the jaiTing oscil- lations of the carriage on the receipt of a powerful shock. In such cases the same kind of pain is complained of. There is the same rigidly inflexible con- dition of the spine, with tenderness on external pressure, and gi-eat aggravation of suffering on movement, more particularly if the patient bend backwards. The patient is unable to stoop ; in attempting to do so, ho always goes down on one of his knees. The muscles and fascite at the back are also often stretched and tom, in cases of hvists and strains of the ligaments of the spinal column. There may therefore be swelling and induration of these tissues from the presence of inflammatory effusions and inability to use the muscles. But the gTeat danger of these strains of the spine is, that they are not imfi-equently associated with some of the most serious affections of the spinal cord that are met “with in surgical practice as a consequence of injury. They may of themselves prove most serious, or even fatal. The Prognosis will depend partly on the extent of the stretching of the muscular and hgamentous structiu’es, partly on whether there is any inflam- matory action excited in them which may extend to the interior of the spinal canal. As a general rule, where muscular, tendinous, and ligamentous struc- titres have been violently stretched, as in an ordinary sprain, however severe, they recover themselves in the course of a few weeks, or at most within three or six months. If a joint, as the shoulder or ankle, continue to be weak and preternaturally mobile, in consequence of elongation of the ligaments, oi weak- ness or atrophy of the muscles, beyond this period, it will, in all probability, never be so strong as it was before the accident. The same holds good with the spine ; and a vertebral column which has been so weakened as to require artificial support, after several months, in order to enable it to maintain the weight of the head, will probably never regain its normal strength. One great prospective danger in strains of the spine is the possibility of the inflammation developed in the fibrous structmes of the column extending to the meninges of the cord. This I have several times seen. It is particularly apt to happen when the strain or twist occurs between the occiput and the atlas or axis. In these cases a rigid tenderness is gTadnally developed, which is most distressing and persistent, and eHdently inflammatory. Or the paralysis may be confined to the nerves that are connected with that part of the spine that is the seat of the ivrench, one or other of their roots either hai'ing suffered lesion, or the nervous cord itself having been injined m its passage through the intei- vertebral foramen. Lastly, a twist of the spine may sloiOy and nisidioiisly be followed by symptoms of complete paraplegia, anc ei en iia y ly c ca i extravasation of blood into the vertebral canal.FRACTURE OF THE SPIRE. 5^9 The Treatment of these injuries is tlie same as that of concussion of the spinal cord (see page oS;]). Fractl’iie of the Spine may occur either by the application of direct violence, or by a ^-iolent twst or bend of the body forwards. Direct A'iolence, as a blow, foil, or gmi-shot injury, may of course fracture the spine at any part and almost to any extent, in some cases merely detaching a spinous process, in others splintering and comminuting several vertebrm and lacerating or dividing the spinal cord. Fractm-e of the spine from a violent but forcible bend of the body forwards chiefly ocem-s in the cervical region. It is usually produced by a person falling from a height on the head, the body being bent forcibly forward so as to drive the chin against the sternum. This accident often liappens in falls from horsebaek, or in taking a “ header ” into shallow water. In some cases it has occurred from a person sitting on the top of a vehicle having the head forcibly bent down Avhilst passing under an archway. In these accidents there are usually extensive ruptime of the spinal ligaments and dis- placement of the bones, as well as fracture. The extent of the fracture and the amount of displacement necessarily vary gTeatly. The spinous process merely may be broken off ; or the arch may be broken through on each side of the spine : or the fr’actime may extend through the body of the vertebra. In some cases of even very extensive fracture there may be no appreciable displacement: but usually some change of position ensues, in many cases to such an extent as to compress or lacerate the spinal cord. The mode of occurrence of the fractiue wiU influence the amount of displacement. If the fracture be thi’ough the arch, or consist in a simple detachment of the spinous process by a fall or a blow on the back, there may be little or no displacement. If it occur from gun-shot injury, or from a fall upon the head, or by forcible flexure of the neck and body forwards, as when the body is comjDressed between the top of a van and an archway, then there will probably be great displacement, and perhaps separation of the articulating sm’faces of contiguous vertebrie. The Signs of this injury vary very greatly, and depend in a great degi-ee upon the extent of the displacement. If this be inconsiderable, it may be extremely difficult, and even impossible in some instances, to pronounce Avith certainty whether the spine has been broken or not; the more so, if the iractiue do not implicate the body of the vertebra. If, on the other hand, the displacement affect the axis of the column or compress the cord, the symptoms arc so marked as to admit of easy diagnosis. The symptoms are of two kinds ; those presented by the injury of the bone, and those dependent on injury by compression or laceration, or both, of the spinal cord. The Local Signs are usually ^lain at the seat of injury, greatly increased on pressure or on mo\ing the part; inequality of the line of the spinous pro- cesses, with depression of the upper portion of the spine, and corresponding prominence of the lower. There is an inability to support the body in the erect position, and to move the spine in any way ; hence, when the upper portion of the column is injured, the jiatient holds his head in a stilf and coMtrained attitude, fearing to turn it to either side. he General Symptoms of fracture of the spine are dependent upon the590 INJURIES OF THE SEINE. injury which the cord has received. If tlie fractui’c have not implicated the spinal canal, as when only the tip ol a spinous process has been broken off, or it it bo unattended by displacenient, although it may traverse the body and aiches, no symptoms depending upon the injury of the cord need exist, and indeed occasionally they arc absent. Ilut even in these cases there is usually some paralysis, owing perhaps to the concussion to which the cord has been sub- jected at the moment of injury ; and occasionally a sudden movement l>y the patient will bring on displacement, by which the cord is compressed and all the parts below the injimed spot are paralysed. A woman was admitted into University College Hospital with an injury of the neck, the natime of which could not he accurately ascertained. She was in no way paralysed, but kept her head immovable in one position. A few days after admission, whilst making a movement in bed, by which she turned her head, she fell back dead. On examination, it was found that the spinous process of the fifth cervical vertebra had been broken olf short, and was impacted in such a Avay between the arches of this and the fomfh as to compress the cord. This impaction and consequent compression probably occurred at the time of the incautious movement, thus producing immediate death. When there is only partial dis- placement, there may be but incomplete paralysis of the parts below the injury ; of one arm, one leg, &c. In these cases there is usually gi’eat pain at the seat of fracture, and extending from it along the line of junction between the paralysed and sound parts round the body or along the hmb. This symp- tom, which is of great importance as exactly defining the seat of injury, is due, as I found in dissecting a case of fr-actiu’e of the sixth cervical vertebra under my care, to the fr-actured bone compressing and irritating the nerve that issues fr'om the vertebral notch opposite the seat of injm-y. When the cord is implicated, the symptoms will vary according to the seat of the injmy and the extent of the damage. Tor a detailed account of the symp- toms presented by injuries of the different portions of the cord, the reader is refen-ed to the section on “Wounds of the Spinal Cord,” (p. 585.) In the majority of cases of fractiue of the spine, there is such displace- ment of the bone as to compress the whole thickness of the cord, and thus to o.ccasion complete paralysis of motion and sensation in the parts below the seat of injury. This paralysis resembles that which arises fr’om simple division of the cord, but is foUowed by greater impairment of nutrition,^ as shown in wasting cachexy, a tendency to sloughing, and alkaline luine. The reason of this difference is, that in fractrue the cord is not simply compressed or divided, but is continuously iiuitated by the edges of broken bone, and thus not only becomes incapable of healing, but is kept in a state of chronic in’itation and inflammation. If the fracture be above the origin of the phrenic nerve, respiratiorr will be arrested and the patient die instantaneously. Prognosis—Although fractrue through the body of a vertebra is generally fatal it is not always, and instances have been known where the brokerr hone united, and the patierrt lived months or even years afterwards ; but fractrrrcs of the spine through the hodies of the vertebrm, with displacement, are in- evitably frrtal. Death occurs in three different ways. It happens primarily aird instantarreously, as the direct and immediate corisequcrice ot the injury, in all those cases in Avhich the fracture is abox'e the origin ot t re p nenic nene.59* TREATMENT OF FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. It occura secondarily and indirectly, at a more or less remote period, as the result of changes in the body dependent on permanent loss of iimervation, in all eases in -wliich the injury sustained by the cord is below the part, the in- te>rrity of which has just been refen-ed to as essential to the maintenance of life. At the seat of injury, of compression, and of disorganisation, in- flammation is necessarily developed ; thenee it spreads along the membranes and to the cord itself to a variable distance, gi\’ing rise to elfnsion into the canal and softening of the medulla. It is doubtless by the gradual extension upwards of these secondary inflammatory disorganisations, that death is ultimately occasioned ; the mischief^ when low down, leading to impair- ment of the actions dependent upon the integrity of the cord, and, when high up, extending to the origins of the phrenic ner\'es and so arresting respiration. The Treatment of these injuries is sufficiently simple. No attempt at re- duetion can of course be made. All our efforts must be dmected to the pro- longation of life. With this ’\dew, if this fracture be in such a situation, at any point below the upper dorsal vertebrae, for instance, as will hold out a prospect of life being prolonged for a few weeks or months, means must be taken to prevent the occuiTence of sloughing of the nates, an accident that is common, and usually fatal, in these cases ; and eveiy precaution should be taken to keep the bladder healthy, one of the great dangers in cases of fr-acture of the spine being the supervention of cystitis, which may gradually extend upwards till the kidney becomes involved. The patient should be laid at once on a Avater- bed, cushion, or mattress ; he must be kept scrupulously clean, and his urine should be drawn off twice in the day at regular hoiu's. If, as usually happens after a time, the bowels become confined, relief must be afforded by castor-oil or tiu’pentine enemata. A nourishing diet must be administered and perfect rest in one position enjoined. In this way life may be maintained for a considerable length of tune ; and ossific union of the fracture may sometimes take place, though the patient may not recoA'er from the paralysis, and Avill die eA’entually fr’om disease of the cord. But in some cases a much moi’c satisfactory result is obtained ; the patient gradually gains power in the paralysed parts. In these cases much assistance Avill be afforded him Ijy his Avearing an apparatus as in Fig, 254, consisting of a firm pehic baud, Avith a strong iron rod shaped to the spine, and running as high as the vertex, having padded transverse arms to support the head and shoulders, and the whole attached to a stout leather case moulded to the back and shoulders. _ Trephining the Spine.—As the fatal result of fracture of the spine is almost meutadc, and as it is undoubtedly dependent upon the compression or divi- sion of the cord by the broken vertebra, the idea has naturally suggested itself 0 mirgeons that life might be prolonged, and health perhaps restored, if the 10 operation Avero extended to the spine Avhich is successfully emnloA^ed in an, of the depiessed port:on of bone. This operation, originally proposed Fig. 254.—Apparatus for Fracture of the Spine.592 INJURIES OF THE SPINE. by Iloistcr, was first performed by lionis and Cline. It may be done as follows. The patient lying on his face, a free incision, several inches in length, from three to fi^•e, according to the extent of the injury, is made along the line of the spinous processes, and the muscular masses on each side of the spine ■are dissected away, so as to expose the osseous surfaces. The spinous pro- -cesses, at the seat of injury, should then be successively seized with strong for- ■ceps, and gently but firmly moved, in order to see whether there be fractine at their base or supporting arches. If a portion of bone be completely broken •off it may, after all ligamentous connexions have been severed, be raised l:»y the forceps or an elevator. Should one arch only be broken through, the un- injured one may be divided by cutting pliers or a Key’s saw ; or, should both be unbroken, the Surgeon may, if he think it prudent to proceed fruther, ■divide both in this way, and so remove them and the spinous j)rocesses, and ' •expose the theca of the cord. After the operation, the wound is to be •simply dressed and the patient kept in the prone position. The results of this operation are not very encoiuaging. It has been per- formed by various Siugeons in different countries, but chiefly in America, about thirty times ; and, although some temporary advantage seems to have j ■occurred in a few of the cases, permanent success has only been obtained in j, one instance by Gordon of Whitworth Hospital, Dublin, but even in this | ease the paralysis remained. But, though so far the result has been but little satisfactory, ought Siu'geons to discard the operation ? I think not : because, as fractm-e of the spine -with serious lesion of the cord cannot be recovered from, and has an almost invariably fatal termination, and as the eKl conse- quences of the fractiu-e are dependent not only upon the primary lesion of the cord, but on the secondary disorganising and mflammatory processes set up in it by the continued irritation of the fractured fragments, we are jirstified in attempting the removal of this soiu’ce of certain misery and impending death by the only means in our power—operative procedm-e ; and we are the more justified in this com-se, as the operation is not neces- sarily dangerous, does not appear often to have hastened death, and has certainly, iii some cases, afforded most marked relief, the paralytic symptoms disappearing to a great extent, and the patient being able to move limbs that were previously motionless. One serious objection that has been urged against the operation must not, however be overlooked. It is, that in the great majority of cases the fr-acture | of a vertebra is through the body and not through the arches. This undoubtedly 1 4.. i‘h ihis circumstance that has rendered the operation as yet little !593 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SPINE. portion of the spine is, undoubtedly, either the continuance of the inflamma- tion excited by the injury in the cord and its membranes, or its increase or tlevelopment by the operation itself. Dislocations of the Spine.—On looking at the arrangement of the arti- cular surfaces of the vertebra), the very limited motion of which they are susceptible, and the way in which they are closely knit together by strong ligaments and short and powerful muscles, it is obvious that dislocations of these bones must be excessively rare. So seldom, indeed, do they occur that their existence has been denied by many Surgeons. Yet there are a suffi- cient number of instances on record to prove that these accidents may happen. Those cases that have been met ivith have usually been associated with partial fracture, but this complication is not necessary. In all, the displacement was incomplete ; and, indeed, a complete dislocation cannot occur. Fracture may occin anywhere in the spine, but dislocation ivithout, or vdth very slight, fractine is exceedingly rare. Dislocation of the spine may occm- in the follow- ing parts. 1. Between the occiput and atlas. This is very rare. 2. Between Fig. 2.55.-^Dislocation bet ween the Piftli and Sixth Cervical Vertebne.

A man was admitted into University College Hospital, who had been crushed by falling between the platform and a train in motion. Amongst other severe injuries he had paralysis of the circumflex and musculo-spiral nerves of the left arm, but no hypertesthesia. On the third day, whilst being moved in bed, his head fell to one side, and he suddenly died. On examination after death, it was found that the second cervical vertebra, carrying the atlas and head with it, had been dislocated from the third (Fig. 250) ; the connecting ligaments being completely torn through on the left side, so that the head falling to one side had caused fatal compression of the cord. Dislocation of tlie Atlas from the Occipital Bone has been described in two instances only—by Lassus and by Paletta. In the case by Lassus, death ensued in six hours, and the right vertebral artery was found to be rup- tiued. In the other case, the patient is said to have lived for five days, but the report is so incomplete that little value can be attached to it. Dislocation of the Axis from the Atlas is of more frequent occiu’rence. It may happen vnth or without fractiue of the odontoid process. In either case, the axis is carried backwards and the spinal cord thus compressed. This accident is said to have been caused by a person in play lifting a child off the ground by its head ; the combination of rotation and traction in this move- ment being especially liable to occasion the accident. For the same reason, it has been met with in those who have been executed by hanging. Death would probably be instantaneous in these circumstances. It has, however, been stated that, in dislocations of this kind, life has been saved by the Surgeon placing his knees against the patient’s shoulders, and drawing or twisting the head into position. This, however, I cannot believe possible if the displace- ment have been complete, as death must be instantaneous, the cases of supposed dislocation and reduction having probably been instances of con- cussion of the cord with sprain of the neck. Dislocation of any one of the five Lower Cervical Vertebrae may occiu’. The third vertebra is least frequently dislocated ; the fifth is more com- monly displaced (Fig. 255). These injuries are usually associated with ft’acture ; sometimes, though rarely, they happen without this complication. In these dislocations, as in those that have afready been described, the displaced bone can-ies with it the whole of that portion of the vertebral colmnn which is above it, no single bone being dislocated either among those above or those below the displacement. In dislocations, the articulations between the two vertebrre are torn open. The supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, the ligamenta subflava, and the common posterior ligament, are torn through, so that the spinal canal is opened. The intervertebral fibro-cartilage may be torn, or it may be entire, and a scale of the body of the subjacent vertebra be detached, men the spine above the dislocated part is bent forwards, a wide gap is visible posteriorly, at the seat o The causes of dislocation arc numerous, but may be enumerated as follows. I. A person standing in a cart and driving under an archway finds,DISLOCATIONS OF THE SPINE. 595 too late, that he is too tall to clear tlio archway; he bends forwards, but, miscal- culating the distance, his head is pressed ■\dolently forwards ; the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments are torn, and perhaps the intervertebral fibro-car- t age is ruptured, or torn oft’ ft’om the subjacent bone, and detaches with it a lamina of that bone. 2. A person takes a header into shallow water ; his head comes against the bottom, he rolls over, and his spine is broken or dis- located. Such accidents are not very unfi’equent. I have seen several cases of paralysis, but not of death, resulting from this kind of accident. Sometimes a child is held up by the chin and the back of the head ; the child struggles and the odontoid process gives way, and dislocation occurs between the first two vertebrffi. These accidents most commonly happen fr’om forcible flexion of the neck forwai’ds, though traction and rotation conjoined have occasioned them. In a case of luxation of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, recorded by J. Eoux, the accident happened to a sailor plunging into the sea for the purpose of bathing, and coming head foremost against a sail which had been spread out to prevent the attack of sharks ; he died on the fourth day. In a patient of mine, who feU out of a window in such a way that the head was doubled for- wards upon the chest, and who was brought to the Hospital with supposed fr'actiu’e of the spine, we found after death, which occurred on the fifth day, that the seventh cervical vertebra, carrying with it the upper portion of the spine and the head, had been dislocated forwards from the first dorsal, there being a wide gap posteriorly between the laminse of these bones, with hori- zontal sphtting of the intervertebral substance, detaching with it an extremely thin and small layer of bone from the body of the seventh vertebra. There was no fr’acture about the articular processes, which were completely separated fr’om one another. In the instance already referred to, in which a man feU on his head from a van, and death resulted in 24 hoiu’s, a similar displacement was found of the fifth fr’om the sixth cervical vertebra, with compression of and hasmorrhage into the substance of the meduUa, and disorganisation of it to the extent of nearly an inch opposite the seat of dislocation, where it had been injined by the forward pressure of the dislocated vertebra. The Sumptoms of these accidents are necessarily excessively obscure, beino- very liable to be confounded with those of fracture. _ Redmtimi has been^ effected in a sufficient number of cases of this kind to justify the attempt being made when danger is imminent. Dislocation of the Transverse Process of the Cervical Vertebra occasionally occurs. The patient, after a sudden movement, or a fall on the head feels much pain and stiffness in the neck, the head being fixed immovably and turned to the opposite side to that on which the displacement has occurred in these cases I have known Reduction effected by the Singeon placino- his _ noes against the patient’s shoulders, drawing on the head, and then tiirnino- it into position, the return being effected with a distinct snap. In the Dorsal Region, dislocation of the spine, though excessivelv rare may occur ; seldom, however, without being accompanied by fr-acture ^ The umbar ,r*'”“ “““ found WocaJd ft-om Ihe intervertebral flbro-cartilage. In Le eaTef r, there has usually been found fracture of the transverse processes of Q Q 2596 INJURIES OF THE SEINE. the first lumbar vertebra, or, as in an instance recorded by Sir C. Bell, fracture of its body. I am not acquainted with any case in which dislocation without fracture of the Lumlar spine has been observed. The Symptoms presented by dislocations of the spine are, like those of fr’actiu’e, dependent on the degree and seat of the injury inflicted on the spinal cord. And death will ensue at varying periods, according to whether the dislocation be above or below the origin of the phrenic nerves, in accordance Avith those rules that have been laid down at p. 587. The Biagnosis between a dislocation and a fracture of the cervical spine is not easily made. But there is one symptom which, according as it is present or not, may throw much hght on this point. It is the occiuTence of pain, amormting to hyperresthesia, along the line of junction between the paralysed and unparalysed parts. In fr’actm’e this wiU commonly be found to be present (p. 590). In dislocation, Avhere the nerves are not irritated or lacerated in their exit through the spinal column, it is absent. The Treatment of dislocation of the spine, except in the case of the transverse processes, resembles in all important respects that of Fractm’e of the vertebral column.597 SALIVARY FISTULA. CHAPTER XXVI. —*— INJURIES OF THE FACE AND ADJACENT PARTS. Face.—Cuts about the Clieehs and Forehead are of common occurrence. These injmies present nothing peculiar’, except that the structures of the face show the same ready disposition to repair, as well as to the supervention of erysipelatous inflannnation, that characterises the scalp when injured. In the Treatment of these wormds,»it is of much consequence to have as little scan-ing as possible. The edges, after being well cleaned, should be brought neatly into apposition by fine hair-hp pins and twisted suture, or by a few points of inteiTupted sutime ; more particularly if the wound be transverse, and impheate the lips or nose. When the wound is in the neighboiuhood of the eyehds, especial care must be taken to prevent any loss of substance, lest the contraction of the cicatrix produce eversion of the lid. In those cases in which a portion of the nose or lip has been lost, much may be done to repair the deformity by properly conducted plastic operations, such as will be described in Chapter LVIII. The bleeding, which is usually very free in wounds of the face, in consequence of the di^dsion of some arterial branch, may often be an-ested by passing the hair-hp pin under the vessel, and apply- ing the twisted sutiue above it, so that it may be compressed. If the Lip he cut from iviihin, by being struck against the teeth, the coronary artery may be divided, the patient swallo’wing the blood that flows into the mouth. Some years ago, a man was brought to the Hospital, drunk, and much bruised about the face. Shortly after his admission he vomited a large quantity of blood, which was at first supposed to proceed from some internal injiuy ; but, on examining his mouth, it was foimd that the blood came from the coronary artery of the lip, which was divided with the mucous membrane. Parotid Duct.—It occasionally hajipens in wounds or abscesses of the cheek that the parotid duct is divided, in consequence of which the wound does not close, and a tnckling of sali va takes place upon the outside of the cheek, so as to estabhsh a Salivary Fistula, a som’ce of much disfigm’ement and incon- > enience. The surface siUTOunding it is puckered and somewhat excoriated, and the fistula opens by a granulating aperture. If this condition be recent, a ciue may sometimes be accomplished, by pai’ing the edges of the external wound, bringing them into close apposition, and applying pressure upon the part. If it be of old standing, the probability is that the aperture into the mouth is closed, and that something more ivill be required than bringing the hps of the wound together. With this view the opCTation that Avill be described in Chapter LY. must be had recourse to. csidcs the fistula of the Btenonian duct, other fistulous apertiues may598 INJURIES OF THE FACE AND ADJACENT PARTS. occur in the cheek, as the result of injiuy or disease, allowing the escape of a small quantity of saliva. These openings are always healed uith difficulty : the edges becoming callous, and not readily taking on reparative action. Closure may be effected in some cases by cauterisation with nitrate of silver, or with a red-hot wire, due attention being paid to the general health. In other cases, the electric cautery may prove successful. It; however, the opening be free, with much indurated structure about it, it may bo necessary to excise a portion of the edges before bringing them together. Nose.—Foreign Bodies, such as pebbles, beads, dried peas, &c., arc occa- sionally met with in the nostrils of children, haA'ing been stuffed up in play, and becoming so firmly fixed as to require extraction by the Sm’geon. For this purpose a j>air of urethral or polypus forceps Avill usually be found con- A’enient. In some cases, hoAveA^er, a bent probe or an ear-scoop will remove the impacted body most easily. The Ears are not unfrequently loounded in injuries of the head and scalp ; a portion of the external ear being sometimes torn doAvn and hanging over the side of the face. In these cases, as in scalp-injuries, the part should ncA-er be removed, but, however lacerated and contused, should be cleaned and replaced by means of a few points of suture and strips of plaster. When the carti- laginous portion of the ear is divided, nice management is usually required in effecting perfect union. Foreign Bodies are often pushed into the ears of children. When pointed or angular, such as pieces of stick, they may readily be extracted with forceps ; but when round and small, such as pebbles or beads, they are not so easily remoA-ed. The foreign body may occasionally be removed by passing the bent ear-scoop round it. In some cases I have found an instru- ment (Fig. 257) made by Coxeter on the model of Cmale’s urethral scoop, useful in extracting a foreign body from the ear. It can be introduced straight and then passed beyond it, Avhen, by the action of a screw in the handle, the scoop is curved fonA'ards, and so enables extraction to be readily effected. But, as a rule, it is bad practice to attempt to remove foreign bodies from the ear by means of instruments ; in the majority of cases the offending body is best removed by forcibly syringing the ear Avith tepid Avater, injected by means of a large brass syidnge in a full stream, the pimia being di’aAATi up so as to straighten the external meatus. In this way the bead or pebble is soon washed out by the reflux of the water striking against the tympanum. It may be laid doAvn as a good general rule, that if a round or oval body cannot be dis- lodged by syringing it Avill not be removed by instruments, and if the proper use of the syringe do not suffice, it is better to leave ruatteis alone, and to aUow the foreign body to become loosened, than to poke instru- ments into the ear Avith the view of forcibly extracting it. These attempts are ill-advised ; and I have kiioiAm death to follow prolonged and uu- successfid efforts at the extraction of a pebble from the eai. , xi i • r^v Orbit.—Injuries of the Orbit may be dangerous, either to the brain or to the eye. If Avounds be deep and directed upiAards, they aie a \iays soiious. Fig. 257. Ear Scoop.CONTUSIOX OF THE EYE. 599 on account of tlie proximity of the brain; thus a pointed body, such as a piece of stick, the end of an umbrella, or a knife thrust into the orbit, may perforate its superior Avail, and produce a fatal wound of the brain. The injiuy to the brain through the orbital plate of the frontal bone may be fatal by the cerebral inflammation that is induced ; or the thrust may extend deeply, and, lacerating the internal carotid artery, occasion fatal hmmoiThagc. In one remarkable case recorded byXelaton, a young man was woimded by the thrust ■of the point of an imrbrella in the orbit; the cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery on the opposite side were Avounded, an arterio-venous aneurism formed, the eyeball became prominent, and death j&.’om hmmorrhage eventually resulted from the giving Avay of the aneurism. Occasionally inflammation is set up in the loose cellulo-adipose tissue contained in the orbit, gmng rise to abscess AA'hich may point in either eyelid ; or to inflammation Avhich may extend to the encephalon. In other cases, Avounds of the orbit may be fol- loAved by loss of Aision, AAithout the eyeball being touched ; either in conse- <pience of injury of the optic nerve, or at a later period fr-om the dhision of some of the other iierA'es of the orbit producing sympathetic amaurosis, as occasionally happens CA'en from ordinary Avouuds of the face implicating some of the teiminal branches of the fifth pair. Eyeball.—Injiuies of the eyeball are so commonly folioAved by impairment or total loss of vision, as to constitute a most important series of accidents ; the delicacy of the structiue of this organ being such, that injury of it is often followed by complete opacity of the lens or other media and loss of sight. The impairment of vision may be the result of direct violence ap- plied to the organ, injming its more transparent parts or displacing the lens ; or it may arise indirectly from various causes which will be presently de- scribed. The injiuies of the eye produced by direct violence, may be divided into contusions and AA'ounds. Contusion of the Eyeball, AAithout rupture or apparent injiuy of any of its structures, may gii’e rise to such concussion of the retina as to be foUoAved by temj)orary or permanent amaiuosis. More frequently contusions of the eye are accompanied by extravasation of blood under the conjunctiA^a, and much ccchymosis of the eyelids. A “ black eye ” is best treated by the continuous application of a AAcak spirit lotion. Contusion of the Eye with Rupture of some of the Structures of the Ball is a most serious accident. The cornea may be ruptiued, the humours lost, and vision permanently destroyed. Most fr-equently the ruptiuc is internal, the outer tunics escaping all injury. In this case we may have an c.xtravasation of lilood into the eyeball, completely tilling the anterior chamber, hiding and complicating deeper mischief within the globe ; or there may be hemorrhage into the vitreous body, AA'ith or Avithout detachment of the retina. This condition, termed haemophthalmia, is fr-equently associated Avith separa- tion of the ciliary margin of the iris. In other cases, the crystalline lens may be driven into the vitreous humour, be engaged in the pupillary aperture, or fall torwards into the anterior chamber. As a consequence of such injuries, the eye usually becomes inflamed, Avith intense fr-ontal and circuuiorbital pain -'dis- eiganisation of the ball, and ultimate loss of vision ensuing.uiND ADJACENT FARTS. INJURIES OF THE FACE 6oo llio Tronfmant must always be of an active antiplilogistie character. Blood shonld be freely taken from the arm by venesection, and from the temple by enppino-, the iris being dilated by the instillation of a solution of tlie snliibatc of atropine, of the strength of two grains to an ounce of distilled water ; the patient must be kept in a darkened room, on a strictly anti- phlogistic regimen, and should be put under the infinence of calomel and oijinm as speedily as possible. In this way the inflammation will be sub- dued, the effused blood absorbed, and perhaps vision restored. In some cases,, however, opaque masses and bands of lymph -will be deposited in the ante- rior chamber and the pupillary aperture, preventing more or less completely the entry of light. If the lens be displaced into the posterior chamber, it must be left there ; if into the anterior, it may be extracted through the cornea. Wounds of the Eyeball may be divided into those that are merely super- ficial, and do not penetrate into its chambers ; and those that perforate its; coats. Non-penetrating Wounds are usually inflicted by splinters of iron, or other metallic bodies, which become fixed in the cornea, or between one of the eyelids and the ball. Very painful and troublesome injuries are sometimes- inflicted by scratches of the eyeball with the nails of children. In the Treatment of these superficial injuries, the first point is necessarily to remove any foreign body. If it be fixed on the cornea, as commonly happens,, it may be picked off with the point of a lancet or cataract-needle, or a “ spud ; ” if it be a splinter of froii that has been so lodged, it is well to bear in mind that a small brown stain will be often left after the metalHc spicnlum ha's been taken off; this, however, will disappear in the course of a few days. In order to remove foreign bodies lodged between the ball and the eyelids, the latter' must be everted so that the angle between the palpebral and the ocular con- junctiva may be properly examined. For this pmpose the lower eyelid need only be drawn down, whilst the patient is directed to look up ; but the ever- sion of the upper eyehd requires some skill. It is best effected by laying a probe horizontally across it, immediately above the tarsal cartilage ; the Sm-geon then, taking the eyelashes and ciliary margin lightly between his finger and thiunb, draws down the eyelid at the same time that he everts it by pressing the probe firmly backwards and downwards against the eyeball; the patient shonld then look down in order that the whole of the upper part of the: conjunctiva, where the foreign body will probably be found, may be carefully examined. Penetrating Wounds of the eyeball present great variety ; they are com- monly inflicted by bits of stick, steel-pens, children’s toys, and not mifrequently dining the shooting season by the explosion of faulty percussion-caps, oi the lodg-ment of a stray shot in the eye. In all cases,, these accidents are high y dangerous to vision ; and, when the foreign body lodges, sight is usually peinianently lost. The danger usually arises either from the eye being opened to such an extent that the humours escape, or else that, the ins becoming engaged in a wound in the cornea, a hernial prolapse of it occiu;s. The more remote effects usually arise from inflammation taking paccnitun le ^ o e, so as to produce an opaque cicatrix ot the cornea oi o. t c capsn e o i lens ; or else adhesions may form, stretching across between e ms anCOKGUSSIOJS^ OF THE EYE, 6oi lens, or between these parts and the posterior surface of the cornea; or inflam- mation may take place in all the structures of the ball, giving rise to rapid and deep disorganisation. The Treatment of penetrating wounds is strictly antiphlogistic. Bleeding in the ann, cujiping on the temples, low diet, a darkened room, and the admi- nistration of calomel and opium, are the principal points to be attended to. If the iris have pi’etruded through a wound in the cornea, it should bo carefully pushed back, and a drop or two of the solution of atropine put upon the eye. If it cannot be returned, it may be removed with a pair of fine curved scissors; and, at a later period, any staphylomatous tumour that may form should be touched repeatedly with a pointed piece of nitrate of silver. If there be a tendency to the fonnation of adhesions, or to the deposit of lymph Avithin the impil or the anterior chamber, our principal reliance should be upon small doses of calomel, in conjunction vith opium. If the lens or its capside have become opaque, traumatic cataract thus forming, extraction may be required at a later period of the case. If the eye be so extensh'ely opened or deeply injimed that vision is irre- parably lost, and extensive suppurative inflammation in it and in the structm'es. of the orbit is threatened, the sooner the globe is extirpated the better ; the patient being thus saved much local and constitutional disturbance, and the danger of sympathetie affection of the other eye being diminished. Indirect Injury of the Eye often follows injmies of the nervous system. Thus impaiiment of vision may be produced by concussion of the eye-ball through blows on the head ; by injuries of the face implicating the fifth pair of nerves ; by injury of the spine ; or by injury of the sympathetic. Concussion of the Eye may be produced by a direct blow on the organ ; or it may be the result of a blow on some other part of the head or face. In the latter case, the injury is dependent on the transmission of the force through the bones of the head or face to the structures mthin the orbit. The resulting impaiiment of A'ision is at its Avorst at the moment of the injmy, and either sloAvly disappears, or becomes permanent in consequence of the development of stnictural changes in the eye. That indirect A'iolence may produce serious lesion of the eye, is evident from the fact that the lens has been in this way dislocated AAdthout any direct injmy having been inflicted on the eye itself. Deyber relates a case in which cataract Avas induced by a Avound of the eyebrow from a stone, the eye itself being^ otherAvise uninjured : and I have seen cataract occur in an othei’Avlse healthy woman aged 40, three or four months after the receipt of a blow on the malar bone in a raihvay collision. It also often happens that, in cases of a general shock to the system, obscuration and impairment of vision gradually manifest themselves. (See p. 57G et seq). When impairment of vision remains permanent, or is gradually developed, after concussion, it is due to interference Avith the nutrition of the structures- of the eye. In such cases, atrophy of the optic disc may often be discovered, by ophthalmoscopic examination. The development of cataract after bloAA^s on the cyebroAV or check is to be accounted for by the frontal or infraorbital nanches of the fifth neiwc being implicated and irritated, so as to impair the nutntioii of the globe.0o2 INJURIES OF THE FACE AND ADJACENT FARTB. Ilie eye may also Bud’er iu eonsef^ueuce of Wound or Irritation of tlie Sranches of the Fifth Pair* of Nerves.* This has long' been observed. Hippoerates speaks of loss of vision consequent on wounds of the eyebrow ; <uid makes the very accurate observation, that the impairment is less when the wound is recent, but increases as cicatrisation ad\-ances. Fabriciiis Hildanus and La Motto relate cases in Avhieh blindness followed wounds of the outer angle of the orbit. Morgagni relates the case of a lady who, in consequence of the o^’crtm-ning of a carriage, was wounded by some splinters of glass in the upper eyelid. The eyeball was uninjured : but vision became gradually impaired, and Avas almost lost by the fortieth day after the accident. It is by no means necessary for the production of impaired Ausion after injury of parts of the fifth nerve, that there should be an actual Avomid ; a simple contusion is sufficient. Wardrop states that it is only AAdiere the frontal nerve is wounded or injiu’ed and not divided, that amam’osis takes place. Indeed, in some cases, amaimosis has been cimed by division of the nerve after its partial injiuy. That it is the irritation, and not complete division of the nerve, that leads to loss of vision, is in accordance with the Auew of BroAvn-Sequard, that the immediate effects of section of a nerve are A^ery different from those Avhich are observed as the result of its irritation. The loss of vision may come on instantaneously, as in a case related by Wardrop of a sailor struck by a ramrod on the eyebroAV; after a few days, as in a case recorded by Chelius where the loss of A'ision came on eight days after a bloAV in the eyebroAv; or after a longer lapse of time, as in most of the recorded cases. In the great majority of cases the impairment of Ausion is at first slight, and gradually goes on to complete loss of sight. In AAfoat way can irritation of a branch of the trifacial nerve, unaccompanied by any direct injury of the eyeball or the structures of the orbit, produce in- stantaneously or remotely loss of vision ? Some observers haA^e attributed this to the propagation of irritation along the sheath of the neive to the trunk of the ophthalmic dmsion, and thence along to the sheath of the optic nerve and the retina. But there is no evidence of such a propagation; and this explana- tion would not account for those cases in which blindness suddenly super- veaied. That injmy of the fifth nerve produces important changes in the eye, has been incontestably determined in late years by the experiments of Snellen, Schiff, Biittner, Messner, and others; and whether we explain the moibid changes that occim in the eye as a consequence of the injury of the nerve by the supposition that “neuro-paralytic” inflammation is set up in the globe, or suppose that the surface by losing its sensibility becomes more liable to the action of external irritants, matters little to the practical Sm-geon. Wardrop says that “ the distribution of the fii-st branch of the fifth pair or ophthalmic branch explains how wounds of the frontal, inff-a-orbital, and other branches of nerves which form anastomoses Avith the ophthalmic gang ion, me sometimes folloAved by amainosis.” No doubt it is to the intiinate cmmexioiis that exist betAveen the frontal nerA'e, the ophthahnic diA-ision of the fifth, and * Sec ■•Concussion of Spine.” Lecture X., r- 233, ei sc,..

In what way this in-itation of the fr-ontal nerve exercises an injurious influence is doubtful, but the fact, as the result of clinical observation, remains certain, that in some cases it is the primary and determining cause of loss of vision. ■\IouTH.—'Wounds of the mouth are seldom met with, except as the result of gun-shot violence. The amount of injury done to the soft structures, however great, is usually only secondary to the mischief that results to the brain, spinal cord, jaws, and skull, and must of com-se be treated on the ordinary principles of treatment of gun-shot and lacerated wounds. Toxgue.—Wounds of the tongue usually occur fi-om its tip or sides being- caught between the teeth during an epileptic fit. They have been known to be inflicted by insane patients, in attempts to excise or to bite off this organ. Should the htemon-hage be free, the application of a ligature, or even of. the actual cautery, may be needed. These wounds generally assume a sloughy ajDpearance for a few days ; they then clean up, and granulate healthily. It is useless to bring the edges together by sutures, which readily cut out. If, however, a large portion of the tip be nearly detached, it must be supported in this way; but the threads should be thick and passed deeply. Pieces of tobacco-pipe are occasionally di'iven into and broken off in the substance of the tongue, and they either give rise to very free heemorrhage, or the wound may close and heal over the foreign body, the existence of which may not be known to the patient. In a case of this kind, where a man complained of much pain and stiffness in the tongue, with difficulty in deglutition, I found on examination, a hard swelling towards the base of the organ; and ou cutting down upon this extracted three inches of the stem of a tobacco-pipe, which, had been lodged there for several months. The Palate and the Pharynx are sometimes lacerated by gun-shot injiu’ies of the mouth: or the wound may result from something that the patient happens to have between his lips being di-iven forcibly backwai-ds into his mouth. Thus, a tobacco-pipe may, by a blow on the face, be di-iven deeply into the substance of the tongue, or perhaps into the pharynx, v^ouuding and lodging behind the arches of the palate, breaking off short; the fi-agment that is left in giving rise to abscess, to ulceration of the vessels, and perhaps to fatal secondary hjemorrhage. In a case that was under my care some time ago, the soft palate was nearly detached fr’om the palatal bones by a deep transverse wound, caused by the end of a spoon being forcibly driven into the mouth ; good union took place e^-entually, the part having been stitched together by a few points of suture.6o4 INJURIES OF THE THROAT. CHAPTER XXVII. —♦—- INJURIES OF THE THROAT : AND ASPHYXIA. INJURIES OP 0?HB LARYNX AND TRACHEA. Dislocation and Fbactuee of the Larynx.—The cartilages of the larynx may be displaced, dislocated as it 'were, by violent blows ; or they may be fractiu'ed by a squeeze, the ruptiu’e in some cases taking place transversely, in others longitudinally. Digital examination will at once detect the natiu’e of the iujmy. In aU these injmies there are pain and difficulty of breathing and of speech, and in some cases spitting of blood and cough, and there is danger of asphyxia, which indeed may be induced by simple concussion of the larynx. Should these symptoms be very urgent, tracheotomy may be required ; if not, attention to position and support of the head will suffice. Wounds of the Throat.—These are of great frequency and importance, implicating as they do, some of the most important organs in the body. They may be divided into three categories :— 1. Those that do not extend into the Air- or Food-passages. 2. Those that implicate the Air-passage, with or without injury of the OEsophagus. 3. Those that are accompanied by mjury of the Spinal Cord. AU these injiu’ies are most commonly suicidal, and may be inflicted with every variety of cutting instrument; except where the spinal cord is injined, which must, in cases of suicide, be the result of giui-shot wound, and is neces- sarily fatal. Though incised, they are often jagged, and partake somewhat of the character of lacerated wounds, with great gaping of the edges. 1. Wounds not extending into the Air- or Tood-passages. In these wounds, there is very commonly fi’ee and even fatal hiemorrhage, and this sometimes though none of the larger arterial or venous tnmks have been divided; the blood flowing abundantly from the venous plexuses or from the thyi’oid body when the wound is low down. If the larger arteries be touched, as the carotid and its primary branches, the haemorrhage may be so abundant as to give rise to almost instantaneous death. Another source of danger cases proceeds from the admission of air into the veins of the so-callcd “ dan- gerous region ” of the neck. For this a free wound is by no means necessai-y, as is instanced by a remarkable case that ocemred some yearn ago neai- London, in which the introduction of a seton into the fore part of the neck was follove by death from this cause. AVounds of the internal jugular vein are necessarily very dangerous, ine is not only the ordinary risk of primary haimorrhagc from a vessel of such laigeWOUNDS OF THE TlIROuiT. 605 size and directly communicating Avith the cerebral sinuses, but the special danger of the introduction of air into it; should these evils be safely got over, the secondary ones of recurrent hiemorrhage, diffuse inflammation, and pytemia, may yet have to be encountered. The ligature of the vessel above and below the Avound in it, exactly as if it Averc an artery that had been opened, is Uie only coui'se that can be safely pursued. In one case in AAhich this aaus being done, I saAV and heard air enter the vein as it was being raised for the passage of the ligature, but the patient made a quick recovery. The large nerves, such as the A-agus and phrenic, can scarcely, in a suicidal Avound, be divided without injury to the neighbouring vessels, but they maybe iujiu-cd by stabs or gun-shot Avouuds. The division, however, of the respiratory nerA-es on one side only, or even of one of them, Avould in all probability be Altai ill man, by interfering AAuth the proper performance of the respiratory act. In a case Avith which I am acquainted, AA^here the phrenic neri'e Avas diAided during ligature of the subclaAdan artery, death resulted in a feiA”^ days from congestion of the lungs. In the Treatment of Avounds of the neck of this categoiy, the principal points to be attended to ai'e, hi the first place, the aiTest of hmmorrhage by the ligature of all bleedhig vessels, whether arterial or A'enous ; and, secondly, bringing together the lips of the wound. If the cut be longitudinal, this may be done by strips of plaster ; if transverse, by a few points of sutme and by position, the head being fixed, with the chin almost touching the sternum, and retained hi this postine by tapes passing fr’om the nightcap to a piece of bandage fixed round the chest. I have had under my care one case in Avhich, OAving to the projection and mobility of the larynx, the wound did not unite, a large and deep gap being left, which required a series of plastic operations in order to efiect its closure. 2. Wounds implicating the Air-passage.—The air-passage is commonly wounded in suicidal attempts. It may be known to be opened by the air being heard and seen to bubble in and out of the wound during resphation. These M'ounds vary much in extent, fr'om a small puncture with the point of a penknife to a cut extending completely across the throat, and even notching the vertebrm. They are frequently complicated Avith injuries of the larger Aussels and nerves, and sometimes Avith wound of the oesophagus. Most commonly the cut is made high up in the neck ; for the suicide, thinking that it is the opening into the air-passage that destroys life, diviAvs the razor across that part of the throat AAhere this is most prominent and easily reached ; and thus, by not wounding the larger vessels, which are saved by the projection of the larynx, frequently fails in accomplishing his object. These wounds occur in four situations : above the Hyoid Bone ; in the Thyro-hyoid Space ; through the Larynx ; and through the Trachea. The wound may be made above the Hyoid Bone; the cut extending into the mouth and Avounding the root of the tongue. A AA'ouud in this situation is usually attended with much hasmonhage ; and there is great trouble in feediim- the patient, as the poAver of SAvalloAvdng is completely lost. The wound may be inflicted in the Thyro-hyoid Space, laying the pharynx open, but being altogether above the larynx. This is the most common situation or suicidal attempts. In many cases, the incision is cai-ried so low as to shaveINJURIES OF THE THROAT. 6o6 otf 01 paitly to detach the epiglottis and the folds of mucous membrane around it. In othci cases, the edges of the glottis or the arytaenoid cartilages are injiucd, the cut extendiug back to the bodies of the vertebrm. Here also there arc great difficulty in swallowing and great risk of the sudden siipeiwention of oedema of the glottis, and consequent suffocation. When the Larynx is wounded the incision is usually transverse ; but I have seen a longitudinal cut made through the larynx, so as to split the thyroid and ciicoid cartilages perpendicularly. In these cases of wounded larynx, there is much danger of the blood from the superficial parts trickling into the air- passage and asphyxiating the patient, and of inflammation of the bronchi and lungs siipei-vening at a later period. Wounds of the Trachea are not so common as those of the larynx, from which they differ but little in the attenklant dangers. The CEsophagus is seldom wounded, as it can only be reached through the trachea by a deep cut, which will probably impheate the large vessels. Effects.—There are various soiu’ces of danger in wounds of the neck im- pheating the air-passage. The luwiorrliage, whether it proceed from any of the larger trunks, or consist of general oozing fi’om a vascular surface, may either prove directly fatal by the amount of blood lost, or indirectly in conse- quence of the blood trickhng into the air-tube, and, by accumulating in its smaller divisions, producing suffocation. Asphyxia may supervene, either in the way already mentioned, or, when the wound has been inflicted above the larynx, from the occurrence of oedema of the glottis. It may hkewise occur when the external opening is very small, and occasionally happens suddenly when the wound is nearly closed. Another source of danger is the loss of the natural sensibility of the glottis, in consequence of which it no longer contracts on the application of a stimulus. Hence food taken in by the mouth may pass into the larynx and appear at the extenial wound, even though neither the pharynx nor the oesophagus has been wounded. This I have observed in many cases of cut throat ; hence the presence of food in the wound cannot in aU cases be considered an evidence of injiny to the food-passage. This occurrence is always a bad sign, and is never met with until a semi-asphyxial condition has come on, by which the nervous sensibilities are blunted, or until inflammation has been set up about the rima glottidis, giving rise to so much swelhng as to interfere with the natural actions, and to deaden the perception of the part to the contact of a foreign body. In these cases also the sensibihty of the air-passage generally is much lowered, so that mucus accumulates in the bronchi, even to a dangerous extent, the patient not feeling the necessity for expectoration, and often, indeed, ha’ving much difficulty in emptying his chest. The occiuTence of bronchitis and pneumonia, either from the inflammation extending downwards from the wound, or in consequence of the cold air entering "the lungs directly, without being warmed by passing through the nasal cavities, is perhaps the most serious complication that can happen, and is a frequent cause of death in jjatients who siuvive the immediate effects ot the wound. The depressed mental condition of the patient also is usually unfavourable toTBEATMENT OF WOUND OF THE THROAT. 607 recovciy in all chose instances in which the wonnd is suicidal, disposing him to the occiuTence of low forms ot inflammatoiy mischief. Treatment.—The same general principles are required as in the manage- ment of those wounds of the throat that do not open up the mucous canals in this region. HmmoiThage must be an-ested by ligature of all the bleeding- vessels,\-hether arteries or veins, so that no oozing or trickling into the wound may take place. In some cases the haemorrhage consists principally of general venous oozing which cannot be stopped by hgature, the patient drawing a large quantity of blood into the air-passage through the wound. In these circiunstances I have found it useful to introduce a large silver tube into the aperture in the windpipe, and to ping the Avound around it. So soon as the bleeding has feirly ceased, the plugs and the tube must be removed. The edges must next be brought together by a feAV stitches introduced at the sides, anefby attention to position, the head being fixed by tapes as described at p. GOo. I think, with Liston, that in these cases the wound should never he closely served up, nor stitches introduced into the centre of the cut. If the centre of the integuments be closely draAvn together, coagula may accumulate behind them, in the deeper parts of the wound, so as to occasion a risk of suffocation ; and, as the wound must eA^entually close by granulation, no material advantage can possibly be gained by this practice. There is an exception, however, to this rule of not using stitches in the central part of the woimd in cut throat. In cases in which the trachea has been completely cut across, a stitch or two on each side of the tube is necessary, in order to prevent the wide separation of the two portions that AA'ould otherwise take place, owing to the gi-eat mobihty of the larynx and upper end of the windpipe. In order to lessen the liability to infiammation of the lungs, the patient should be put into a room, the temperature of which is raised to about 80° Fahr., with a piece of lightly folded muslin acting as a respirator laid OA'er the Avound. So soon as the cut surfaces begin to granulate, w^ater-dressing may be applied, and the edge of the Avound brought into apposition by strips of plaster, and a compress if necessary. During the treatment, the principal danger proceeds from inflammatory affections of the chest; these must accord- ingly be counteracted by the temperature in Avhich the patient is jAlaced, and by the adoption of antiphlogistic measm-es. It must, however, be remembered that the mental depression, and the bodily exhaustion from loss of blood, that arc common in these cases, do not allow A’ery active treatment. The administration of food in these cases abvays requires much attention. As a general rule, the patient should be kept on a nom’ishing diet, Avith a moderate allowance of stimulants. If, as not uncommonly happens, the food- passage be opened in consequence of the woxmd extending into the mouth, the pharynx, or the oesophagus, it is of course impossible for the patient to swallow, and the administration of nourishment becomes A^cry difiicult. This is best accomplished by means of an elastic gmn catheter passed through the mouth into the gullet or stomach. This is easier than passing the instrument throuo-h the nose, and much better than introducing it through the Avound. In this ■Nvay a pint or more of the strongest beef-tea or soup, Avith Liebig’s “Extract of Meat,” mixed with tAvo or three eggs, and having an ounce or tw^o of brandy added to it, should be injected regularly night and morning, until the6o8 INJUBIES OF THE THROAT. patient is able to swallow. In those cases in which the wonnd is above the larynx, there is occasional danger ol the supervention of oedema of tlie glottis ; should this occur, tracheotomy may be necessary to prolong the Tjatient’s life. As consequences of wounds of the throat, we occasionally find stricture of the trachea, or aerial fistula. If the vocal chords have been injured, loss of voice may follow. Aerial Fistula may sometimes form owing to the skin doubling in and becoming adherent to the edges of the wound in the air-tube, and most fre- quently occui’S when the cut is in the thyro-hyoid space ; adhesion taking place between the inverted integuments and the os hyoidcs above, and the surface of the thjnoid cartilage below. The same may occm- in the crico- thyi’oid space, and indeed at any part of the larynx that has been opened. When this happens, there is a tendency to the fistula continuing patent. In these circumstances, I have found the following operation successful. The edges of the fistulous opening having been freely pared, and the knife passed under them for some distance so as to detach them from the subjacent parts, a vertical incision is made through the lower lip of the opening, so as to split it downAvards. Two points of suture are then inserted into each side of the horizontal incisions, bringing their edges into contact, lut the vertical cut is left free for discharges and mucus to drain through, and for the expired air to escape, lest emphysema occur. Unless this outlet be afforded, these fluids Avill bm-st through the sutures, and thus destroy union of the edges. It is not in every case that an aerial fistula can be safely closed. In some instances the larynx becomes contracted either by di-awing in of the wound, or by thickening of the mucous membrane above the artificial opening to such an extent that the fistula becomes essential, in addition to the orifice of the glottis, for the purposes of respiration. In such circumstances, any attempt at dosing it will be attended or followed by symptoms of impending asphyxia or collapse of the lungs ; and it may be necessary to leave the opening fi-ee, or even, as happened in a case under my care, in which an opening was left in the crico-thyroid membrane of a girl who had attempted suickle by cutting her throat, to enlarge the opening and to introduce a silver tube m order to relieve the breathing from the effects of the laryngeal constriction. PoEBiGN Bodies in the Air-Passage.—A great variety of substances have been found in the air-passage : such as nut-shells, beans, cherry-stones, teeth, meat, money, buttons, pins, fish-bones, bullets, pills, pebbles, and pieces of stick. These foreign bodies are not introduced into the air-passage by any effort of deglutition, for no substance can be stvallowed through^ the glottis ; but they are inhaled; thus, if a person, whilst holding anything in his mouth make a sudden inspiration, the current of air may draw it between the dilated lips of the glottis into the larynx. , . , , i j • The symptoms vary, according to the situation in which the foieigm ° 7 lodged, its nature, and the period that has elapsed since the occim-ence of the uccrdeit. The foroign body may lodge in one of the ventricles of the Im^x ; or, if light, it may float in the trachea, carried up and down by the move- ment of the air in expiration and inspiration. If too eavy oi is, i am a into one or other of the primary divisions of the trachea, and, as Aston y609 FOREIGN BODIES IN THE AIR-PASSAGE. has observed, will most commonly be found in the right bronclms. The ex- planation of this has been pointed out by Gray, who states that on making a transverse section of the trachea, and taking a bird’s-eye view of the ])ifurca- tion, the septum vill bo seen to be considerably to the left of the middle line ; so that any foreign body falling down the trachea would naturally have a gi-eater chance of entering the right than the left bronchus, although the left bronchus is a more direct continuation of the trachea than the right. The gi’eater size of the right bronchus would also favoiu- the entrance of a foreign body into it. If the substance be small, it may pass into one of the secondary divisions of the bronchi ; and, if it continue to be lodged here for a sufficient length of time, may make a kind of cavity for itself in the substance of the limg, where it may either lie in an abscess, or become encysted. The Symptoms may be divided into three stages : 1. Obstruction, imme- diately following the introduction of the substance ; 2. Imtation, produced by its presence ; and 3. Inflammation, coming on at a later period. 1. Symptoms of Obstruction.—The immediate symptoms vary somewhat according to the size and natime of the body, and the part of the ah'-tube that it reaches. In aU cases there is a feeling of intense suffocation, with great difficulty of breathing, and violent fits of spasmodic coughing, often attended by vomiting ; diming which the foreign body may be expelled. Indeed, its partial entry and immediate extrusion by coughing are not uncommon. In some cases, immediate death may ensue at this jieriod. If the body have entered the am-passage folly, there is violent coughing, with feeling of suffoca- tion foi an horn’ or two, accompanied by hvidity of the face, gTeat anxiety, and sense of impending death. There is also usually pain about the epistemal notch. The symptoms then gradually subside, but any movement on the part of the patient brings them on again with renewed violence. AU these symp- toms are most severe if the foreign body remain in the larynx ; the voice being- then croupy, irregular in tone, or altogether lost. If it be lodged elsewhere” so often as it is coughed up, and strikes against fhe interior of the larynx, an intense feeling of suffocation is produced ; and if it happen to become impacted there, sudden death may result, even though it he not of sufficient size to block up the aiwpassagc, apparently by the spasm that is induced. Some years ao-o a boy died at the Westminster Hospital before tracheotomy could be performed in consequence of a flat piece of walnut-sheU that had entered the trachea eing suddenly coughed up, and becoming impacted in one of the ventricles of the larymx The symptoms, during this period, are much less severe when the loreign body is in the trachea or bronchi. men there is a suspicion that the foreign body is lodged in the larvnx a iaryngoscopic examination should be made, when it may, perhaps, if laro-e— as a plate with false teeth—be seen between the vocal cords. ^ _ 2. Symptoms of Irritation.—When the foreign body has passed into the air-passage, and the immediate effects produced by its intJoduction have ft Tr of symptoms, dependent on the irritation produced by 1 tv' 'f ^1 the occurrence of these that tL pXtffi are o/tv-rp burgeon’s observations.

These attacks do not occur when the patient is tranquil, but come on whenever the foreign body is coughed up so as to strike the larynx, and the upper and more sensitive parts of the air- passage. As a general rule, the distress is less, the lower the substance is lodged ; the sensibility of the lower portion of the trachea and that of the bronchi being much less acute than that of the larynx and of the upper part of the trachea. In consequence of the irritation, there is usually abundant expectoration of frothy mucus. These symptoms often remit for a time, more particularly if the foreign body become fixed. In some cases indeed, there appears to be so little distress some days after the accident, that considerable doubt may exist whether any foreign body really be lodged in the air-passage or in the lungs ; and much valuable time is often lost by the indisposition of the Surgeon to adopt active measimes. The Auscultatory Signs depend necessarily upon the situation of the foreign body. If this be loose and floating, it may be heard, on applying the ear to the chest, moving up and doAvn, and occasionally striking against the side of the trachea. If it be fixed, it vdll necessarily give rise to a certain degree of obstruction to the admission of the air beyond it, perhaps occasion- ing bniits dining its passage. If it be impacted in the larynx, the voice will be hoarse and croupy, and there wiU be a loud rough sound in resphation, Avith much spasmodic cough and distress in breathing. If it be impacted in one bronchus, the respiratory murmin will be much diminished, or even absent, in the corresponding lung, and probably puerile in the other ; whilst percus- sion will yield an equally clear and sonorous sound on both sides of the chest, air being contained in the lung of the obstructed side, but not readily passing in and out. If one of the subdivisions of either bronchus be occupied by the foreign body, the entrance of air mR be prevented in the corresponding lobe of that lung, though it enter freely every other part of the chest. If the foreign body be angular, or, perforated, peculiar sibilant and whisthng noises may be heard as the air passes over and through it. 3. Inflammation.—^After a foreign body has been lodged for a day or two, inflcmimation of the IroncM or lungs is apt to be set up ; in some cases, how- ever, this only occins after a considerable time has elapsed, or, perhaps, not at all much depending, of coimse, on the shape and character of the irritant. If it continue to lodge, it generaUy forms for itself a cavity in the substance of the luno-, whence pimulent and bloody matters are continually expectorated, until th^patient dies of phthisis in the comse of a few months, or a year or two. Occasionally, however, the substance has been coughed up after a lery louo- lodgment, the patient recovering. Thus, Tulpius relates a case m v hic ^ a nut-shell was coughed up after being lodged for seven years ; and Heckster one in which a ducat was thus brought up after a lapse of two years and a half • the patients, in both instances, recovering. In other cases death may ensue although the foreign body is coughed up ; thus Sue relates an instaiic in which a pigeon-bone was spat up seventeen years after its introduction, the natient however, dying in little more than a year from marasmus. ^ depends more upon the natnre of the fore,gn body and its Bine to on any other circmnstances. If it be rongh. angular, and hard,6i I FOliEIGN BODIES IN THE AIR-FAS SAGE. there is necessarily much more risk than if it be soluble in, or capable of clisintegration by, the mucus of the air-passage. So long as the foreign! body is allowed to remain, the joatient is in imminent danger, either i’rom immediate and sudden sulFocation, or from inflammation at a more remote period. The danger depends greatly upon the length of time during which the body is allowed to lodge. Of G2 cases which I collected in 1850 (4 of which had fallen under my 0!vn observation), I found the time that the foreign body was allowed to remain in, and the result of the case, stated in 49 instances.

If, then, a patient be seen a few hoiu’s, days, or weeks, after a foreign body has been introducedliinto the aii’-passage, an examination vdth the laryngo- scope may be made ; and if the body be within reach, an attempt may be made to remove it by the mouth. If it be not in sight, inv'ersion of the body may be practised; and if both those means fail, or be inapplicable, tracheotomy ought to be performed. And this should be done, even though the symptoms be not urgent. There is often a remission in the symptoms, a period of deceptive secin-ity, by which the Sm-geon must not be j)ut off his guard. But, it may be asked, for what purpose is the trachea opened ? Why should not the foreign body be expelled through the same aperture by which it has entered ? The opening in the trachea performs a double piupose ; it not only seiwes as a ready and j)assive^outlet for the expulsion of the foreign body, but also as a second breathing aperture in the event of its escaping through the glottis. The advantage of the opening in the trachea as a ready aperture of expulsion is evddent from the^fact that, of 14 of the operated cases in which it is stated how the foreign body was expelled, I find that in 12 it was ejected through the artificial opening, whilst in 2 only did it pass out through the glottis. The reason why the foreign body usually passes out of the artificial opening in preference to escaping by the glottis, is, that the sides of the former aperture •are passive, Avhereas those of the latter are highly sensitive and contractile. Before the operation is performed, it Avill be found that the great obstacle to ■expulsion is not only the sensitiveness of the larynx, gi-eat UTitation being in- duced Avhen it is touched from within, but also the contraction of the glottis, by the closure of which not only is the exjpulsion of the foreign body preA'ented, but respiration is impeded. Every time the foreign body is coughed uja so as to touch the interior of the larynx, intense dyspnoea is produced, owing to sudden and imroluntary closure of the glottis, by which respii'ation is entirely pieA ented and suffocation threatened ; the expulsion of the body is consequently jested, unless it by chance take the glottis by surprise, and pass through it at once in the same way that it has entered it, without touching its sides. If there be a second breathing aperture, though the larynx is equally irritated by the foreign body,-yet this dyspnoea cannot occur, respiration being- can ied on uninterruptedly by one opening whilst the foreign body escajAes t uough the other ; and thus, in these circimistances, it may pass through the glottis Avith but little inconvenience.

After tbe escape of tbe foreign body, tbe opening in tbe trachea, must be closed. Scalds op the Mouth, the Pharynx, and the Glottis, occasionally occur from attempts to swallow boiling water ; or these parts are scorched by tbe inhalation of hot air or flame. The scalding chiefly happens to the chil- dren of tbe poor, who, being in tbe habit of drinking cold water from tbe spout of a kettle, inadvertently attempt to take a draught from tbe same soimce vEen tbe vmter is boiling.

The accident always reveals itself by very evident signs ; the interior of the month looks white and scalded, the child complains'^of great pain, and difficulty of breathing soon sets in ; which, unless efficiently refleved, may terminate in speedy suffocation. In those cases in Avhich these parts have been similarly injm-ed by the flame produced by the cxiflosion.of gas or of flre-damp being sucked into the month, the same condi- tions present themseh’es. . 1 i In the Treatment of this injmy, the mam point to attend to is to subdue tlie inflammation before it involves the glottis to a dangerous extent.

ASPHYXIA OB APNOEA. Asphyxia, or, as it is more correctly termed, Apnoea, may arise fr'om various causes. The follovdng classification is derived firom a table by Harley. 1. Mechanical Impediment to the Entrance of Air into the Lungs, A, From Accident: either (1) externed, as in pressiu-e on the trunk pre- venting expansion of the chest ; pressure on the throat; smothering ; injiuy of the spinal cord causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles ; penetrating V'ound of the chest, admitting air ; or (2) interned, as in obstruction of the fauces or larpix by foreign bodies, or in constriction of these parts from the application of irritating fiuids. B. From Disease; as in pressure on the trachea by an aneurism or other tumoim; oedema of the glottis ; obstruction of the air-passage by tumour ; accumulated mucus, &c. 2. Drowning. 3. Absence of Oxygen,—^nitrogen, hydrogen, or some other harmless gas being inhaled. 4. Accumulation of Carbonic Acid Gas in the Blood. 5. Inhalation of Toxic Gas or Vapour. Several of the conditions above enumerated as producing apnoea have been ah-eady described in the preceding pages ; and others will be considered when we speak of diseases of and operations on the Air-passage. In this place we vfill speak of the Surgical management of cases in which respiration has been suspended by Drovming, Hanging, and the respiration of Hoxious Gases. The general subject of Suspended Animation from these various causes cannot be discussed here, but we must briefly consider some points of practical importance in its treatment. In cases of Drowning, life is often recoverable, although the sufferer may have been in the water for a considerable time ; foi’, though immersed, he may very probably not have been siibmersed dining the whole time. The period after which life ceases to be recoverable in cases of submersion, cannot be very accurately estimated. The officers of the Royal Humane Society, who have great expeiience, state that most generally persons are not recoverable who haie been more than four or five minutes under water. In these cases, hovcver, although submersion may not continue for a longer period than this, the process of asphyxia does ; this condition not ceasing on the withcfrawal of the body fr-om the water, but continuing until the blood in the pulmonary ■vessels is aerated, either by the spontaneous or artificial inflation of the lungs. As several minutes are most commonly consumed in withdrawing the body •om the water and conveying it to land, dining which time no means can be L’T ij^to the lungs, we must regard the asphyxia as continuing 5 occupying, indeed, the time that intervenes tion submersion, and the first inspira- , V lethei artificial or spontaneous, after the removal of the body from theINJURIES OF THE THROAT. 6i6 The latest time at which life can be recalled, during this period, is the measure of the duration of life in asphyxia. If, during this period, the action of the heart should cease entirely, I believe, with Brodie, that the circulation can ncr ei be restored. But although wo may put out of consideration those marvellous cases of restoration of life that are recorded by the older writers, and which are o'shdently unworthy of credence, are Ave to I’oject as exaggerated and apocryphal cases such as that by Smethurst, in which recovery took place after ten minutes’ submersion ; that by Douglas of Havre, in which the patient Avas not only submersed, but had actually sunk into, and Avas fixed in the mud at the bottom of the harboiu’ for from tweB'e to fom*teen minutes ; or that by Weeks, in Avhich the submersion, on the testimony of the most credible witnesses, exceeded half an horn’ ? I thmk that it would be unphilosophical in the extreme to deny the facts clearly stated by these gentlemen ; the more so that in these, as in many other instances of apparent death from drowning, life appears to have been prolonged by the patient falling into a state of syncope at the moment of immersion. We must therefore not despair of recovery, but should employ means of resuscitation, even though the body have been actually mider water a considerable time. There are certain minor means often employed in the case of persons who have been immersed in water, and are apparently droAvned, which appear to be AveU adapted for the treatment of the less severe forms of asphyxia, or rather cases of syncope from fright and immersion in cold water. These consist, after the nose and mouth haA^e been cleared of any collections of mucus, in the ap- plication of heat by means of a bath at about the temperature of 100° Fahr. until the natural Avarmth is restored ; in the employment of brisk friction ; and in passing of ammonia to and fro under the nostrils. It is evident that these measmes can haA''e no direct influence upon the heart and lungs, but can only act as general stimuli to the system, equalising the circulation if it be still going on ; and, by determining the flow of blood to the surface, tending to remove those congestions that are not so much the consequences of the asphyxia, as of the sojomn of the body for several minutes in cold AA'ater ; they would therefore be of especial service during the colder seasons of the year. A hot bath may also, by the shock it gives, excite the reflex respiratory move- ments. With the view of doing this with a greater degree of certamty, cold Avater should be sprinkled or dashed upon the face at the time when the body is immersed in the hot bath, as in this way a most powerful exciting influence can be communicated to the respnatory muscles ; and the first object of treat- ment in all cases of asphyxia—the re-establishment of respiration Avould more rapidly and effectually be accomphshed ; deep gaspings ensuing, by which the air Avould be sucked into the remote ramifications of the air-cells, aerating the blood that had accmnulated in the piflmonary vessels, and enabling it to find its Avay to the left cavities of the heart, and thus to excite that organ to increased activity. These means, then, are useful in those cases of asphyxia in Avhich the sufferer has been but a short tune submersed, and in Avhi eh the heart is still acting, and the respiratory movements have either begun ot their OAAm accord on the patient being removed from the water, or m Avhich they arc capable of being excited by the shock of a hot bath, aided by t le as niig o cold AAnter in the face. At the same time the lungs maybe e am pureTREATMENT OF ASPHYXIA FROM DROWNING. 617 air, by compressing the chest and abdomen, so as to expel the vitiated air, and then allowing them to recover their usual dimensions by the natui-al resiliency of their parietes. A small quantity of air vdll, in this way, be sucked in each time the chest is allowed to expand, and thus the re-establishment of the natural process of respiration may bo much hastened. This simple mode of restoring the vital actions should never be omitted, as it is not attended with the least danger, and does not in any way interfere vdth the other measures employed. Marshall Hall has recommended that the patient be turned prone, so that the tongue may hang forwards, and the larynx thus be opened ; and that respiration be then set up by gentle jiressure along the back, and by tiuTiing the patient on his side at regular intervals. It, by these moans, we succeed in restoring the proper action of the respiratory movements, it will merely be necessary to pay attention to the after-treatment. Should we, however, fail in restoring respiration, we should have recourse to other and more active measines. In the more severe cases of asphyxia, warmth should be applied by means of a hot-air bath, by which not only the natinal temperatme of the body may be re-established, but the blood in the capillaries of the surface be decarbonised. The most direct and efficient means, however, that we possess for the re-estab- lishment of the circulation in these cases is certainly Artificial Respiration. In this way alone the pulmonary artery and the capillaries of the lungs can be unloaded of the blood that has stagnated in them, and the left side and substance of the heart will be directly and rapidly supplied with red blood. The whole value of artificial respiration depends, however, upon the way in which it is employed. Inflation is not very effectual from the mouth of an assistant into the nostrils or mouth of the sufferer, as air once respired is not well fitted for the resuscitation of the few sparks of life that may be left, but it is in many instances the readiest and indeed the only mode by which resphation can be set up, especially if water or other fluids have found their wny into the mouth. The bellows, if properly constructed for artificial inflation, so that the Cjuantity of air injected may be measured, are no doubt very useful; and if furnished with Leroy’s trachea-pipes, or what is better, with nostril tubes, may be safely employed. About fifteen cubic inches of air may be introduced at each stroke of the bellows, and these should be worked ten or a dozen times in a minute. The lungs should be emptied by compression of the chest before beginning to inflate, and, alter each inflation, by compressing the chest and abdomen ; but care must also be taken not to employ much force, lest the air-cells be ruptured. Richardson has devised a pocket-bellows for artificial respiration, consisting of two elastic hand-bellows with a single tube for intro- duction into the nostril. A safe, and at the same time a very efficient mode of introducing pure air into the lungs, is, by the elastic expansion of the walls of the chest. This may be effected in various ways; either by means of the split sheet, as recommended by Leroy and Dalrymple (Rig. 258), or else by alternately compressing the chest and abdomen with the hand, and then remoHng the pressure so as to allow the thorax to expand by the natural resiliency of its parietes, and thus, each time it expands, to allow a certain quantity of air to be sucked into the bronchi. The method recommended byINJURIES OF THE THROAT. 6i8 Silvester, find now adopted by the Royal Humane Society, effects this puipose v ith great ease and certainty. It is carried out in the following way. The Fig. 25S.—Split-slieet api)lied. patient is laid on a flat siu’face on his back, with the head and shoulders slightly raised on a pillow. The tongue should be draAvn and held forwards. The arms are then to be grasped just above the elbows, and to be drawn gently and steadily upwards above the head (Fig. 259), in which position they are Fig. 259.—Silvester’s Method—Iiispiratinn. kept for two seconds ; they arc then to be timied downwards, and to be pressed for two seconds gently and fii-mly against the sides of the diest (Fig. 260). These movements are to be repeated deliberately about fifteen times in the minute, imtil natural efforts at respiration are induced, when they are to be discontinued, and the ordinary means to promote circulation and warmth employed. The quantitySECONDARY ASPHYXIA. 619 of air introduced need not be large ; for, by the law of the diffusion of gases, if fresh air be only introduced into the larger divisions of the bronchi, it will rapidly and with certainty find its way into the ultimate ramifications of these tubes. This last means of inflation has the additional advantage of Fig. 260.—Silvester’s Method—Expiration. resembling closely the natimal process of respiration, which is one of expansion from without inwards, and not, as when the mouth or bellows are used, of pressiu’e from within outwards. In one case the Imigs are, as it were, drawn outwards, the air merely rushing in to fill uj) the vacuum that would otherwise be produced within the thorax by the expansion of its parietes ; in the other they are forcibly pressed up from mthin, and hence there is a danger of rupture of the air-cells. Inflation of the Lungs with Oxygen Gas is likely to be of great service in extreme cases of asphyxia. I have found by experiment that the contractions of the heart can be excited by inflating the lungs with this gas, when the introduction of atmospheric air fails in doing so ; and there are cases on record in which resuscitation was effected by inflating the lungs with oxygen, when in all pro- babihty it could not have been effected ivith any other means. In my Essay on “Asphyxia” will be found a case of resuscitation, in which oxygen was suc- cessfrdly administered by Weeks after the asphyxia had continued thi’ce- fiuarters of an hour. Whatever means of resuscitation are adopted, they should be continued for at least three or four hours, even though no signs of life show themselves ; and after ordinaiy respiration has been re-established, the patient should be kept quiet in bed for some hours. The danger of the supoiwention of Secondary Asphyxia after recovery has apparently taken place is much increased, and indeed is usually brought about, ^y some effort on the part of the patient that tends to embarrass the partially restored action of the heart and lungs. The patient, being to all appearances620 INJURIES OF THE THROAT. resuscitated, is alloAvod to get up and ■wallc home, ■when tlie symptoms of asphyxia speedily return. Sliould symptoms of secondary asphyxia, such as stujDor, laborious respiration, dilatation of the pupils, and convulsions, manifest themselves, artificial respiration should be immediately set up, and be main- tained until the action of the heart has been fully restored. In these cases I should, from the very great efficacy of electricity in the somewhat similar con- dition resulting from the administration of the narcotic poisons, be disposed to recommend slight shocks to be passed through. the base of the brain and upper portion of the spinal cord, so as to stimulate the respiratoiy tracts. Asphyxia fr’om the Kespiration of Noxious Gases, such as carbonic acid, is best treated by exposing the surface of the body to cold air, by dashing- cold water upon the face, and by setting up artificial resphation -\nthout delay, if the impression of cold upon the surface do not excite these actions. There is a peculiar variety of this kind of asphyxia, which is occasionally met A\dth among infants, the true natiu-e of which was pointed out to me by Wakley, who, as coroner, had abundant opportunities of witnessing it, as it is not an imcommon cause of accidental death amongst the children of the poor. It is that condition in which a child is said to have been overlaid; the child, sleeping with its mother or niuse, being foimd in the morning suffocated in the bed. On examination no marks of pressure avQI be found but the right cavdties of the heart and lungs are gorged with blood, and the siuface is livid, clearly indicating death by asphyxia. That this accident is not the re- sult of the mother OA’erlaying her child, is not only evident fr-om the post mortem appearances, but Avas clearly proved by a melancholy case to which I was called seA'eral years ago, in which a mother, on waking in the morning found her tAvin infants lying dead, one on each side of her. Here it was eAudent, fr-om the j)osition of the bodies, that she could not have overlayed both. The true cause of death is partly the inhalation of, and slow suffocation by, the vitiated air Avhich accumulates under the bed-clothes that have been dravm, for the sake of Avarmth, over the child’s head, and partly the diminished supply of oxygen. In such cases, resuscitation by artificial respiration should always be attempted if any signs of life be left. Asphyxia from the respiration of Carbonic oxide is more fr-equent than Surgeons are apt to imagine. As has been afready stated in the chapter on Burns, death often takes place in cases where builduigs are on fire from poisoning- by the respiration of carbonic oxide. According- to Leblanc, it is this gas that is the poisonous agent given ofP in the fumes of charcoal. Lhe effect of the respiration of carbonic oxide gas is to deprive the red corpuscles ef their power to carry oxygen, and death takes place rather from the want of oxygen than from the poisonous action of carbonic oxide itself. The inhalation of oxygen is of service in such cases, but it must be borne in mind that death is generally very rapid. _ In cases of Hanging, death seldom results fr-om pine asphyxia, m is usually the consequence, to a certain degree at least, of apoplexy, and craimon y of simultaneous injury of the spinal cord. In these cases, bleeding om e jugular vein may be conjoined Avith artificial respiiation. ^ ^ If there should be a difficulty in setting up artificial respiration through the mouth or nose, as is more especially likely to happen when the patient hasFOREIGN BODIES IN THE (ESOFHiWUS. 621 been suffocateel by breatliing noxious gases, or in cases of hanging, tracheotomy or laryiagotomy should at once be performed, and the lungs inflated through the opening thus made in the neck. INJUBIES OP THE PHABYNX AND (ESOPHAGUS. AVouAms OF THE OESOPHAGUS are chiefly met with in cases of cut-throat, in which, as has been already stated in treating of this injury, they occasion much difficulty by interfering with deglutition. Foreign Bodies not uncommonly become impacted in the pharynx and oesophagus, and may produce great inconyenience by their size or shape. If large, as a piece of money, or a lump of meat, the substance may become fixed in the lower part of the phaiynx or the commencement of the oesophagus, which is narrowed by the projection of the larynx backwards, and, compressing or occluding the orifice of the glottis, may sufibcate the patient at once. If the foreign body go beyond this point, it usually becomes arrested near the tennination of the oesophagus. lYhen it is small or pointed, as a fish-bone, pin, or bristle, it may become entangled in the folds of mucous membrane that stretch from the root of the tongue to the epiglottis, or that lie along the sides of the pharynx. In some cases it may eyen perforate these, penetrating the substance of the laiynx, and thus producing intense local irritation, cough, dyspnena, and suffocation. The foreign body, by transfixing the coats of the oesophagus, may seriously injure some neighbouring parts of importance. Thus, in a curious case admitted into the IJniyersity College Hospital, a juggler, in attempting to swallow a blunted sword, by pushing it down his tliroat, perforated the oesophagus and wounded the pericardium; death consequently resulted in the com’se of a few days. The Sjrmptoms occasioned by the'impaction of a foreign body in the food- passages are sufficiently eyident. The sensations of the patient, who usually complains of imeasiness about the top of the sternum, difficulty in swallowing solids, and perhaps an lugent sense of suffocation, lead to the detection of the accident. Should any doubt exist, the Surgeon may, by introducing his finger, explore nearly the whole of the phaiynx, and should examine the oesophagus by the cautious introduction of a weU-oiled probang. If the impaction be allowed to continue um’elieyed, not only may deglutition and respiration be seriously interfered with, but ulceration of the oesophagus will take place, and abscess fonu either behind it or between it and the trachea; or fatal hiemon’hage may ensue by perforation or ulceration of neighbourino- blood-yessels. ° ^ The Treatment must depend upon the natiue of the foreign body and its situation. Should it be large, blocking up the pharynx so as to render resjiira- tioii impracticable, it may be hooked out by the Surgeon’s fingers. Should asphyxia ha’^u been induced, it may be necessary to perform tracheotomy at once, and to keep up artificial respiration until the foreign body can be ex- tracted. If it be smaU or pointed, as a fish-bone or pin for instance, thouoh it aye lodged high up, the Surgeon will usually exqierience great difficulty in 18 icmoyal, as it becomes entangled between and is coyered in by the folds of e mucous memljranc, where from its small size it may escape detection. InINJURIES OF THE GULLET. <522 these cases, an expanding probang will be found useful. After it has l:)ecn removed, the patient will experience for some time a priclcing sensation, as if it wei’e still fixed. If the impacted body have passed low down into the oesophagus, the Surgeon must deal with it according to its nature. If it be smooth and soft, as a piece of meat for instance, it may be pushed domr into the throat by the gentle pressure of the probang. If, however, it be rough, hard, or sharp-pointed, as a piece of earthenware, or bone, or a metallic plate, with false teeth attached, such a procedure would certainly cause perforation of the oesophagus, and serious mischief to the parts around ; in these circumstances, therefore, an attempt at extraction should be made by means of long slightly curved forceps, constructed for the purpose. The foreign body occasionally becomes so firmly impacted in the pharynx or oesophagus, that the employment of any degree of force for extracting it would be attended vdth danger of perforating the oesophagus or transfixing the large vessels of the neck; in these circumstances it may become necessary to open the tube and thus remove it. The operation of Pharyngotomy or <Esoph.agotoniy is seldom called for; if required, it may be performed by making an incision about four inches in length along the anterior border of the left sterno-mastoid muscle, the oesophagus naturally cimdng somewhat towards the left side. The dissection must then be carried with great caution between the carotid sheath and the larynx and trachea in a direction backwards, the emo-hyoid muscle having been divided in order to afford room. Care must be taken in this deep dissection not to wound either of the thyroid arteries, more cspeci^illy the inferior one, which -will be endangered by canying the incisions too low. When the pharynx or the oesophagus has been reached, a sound or catheter should be passed through the mouth into this cavity, and pushed forwards so that its point may cause the walls to project, and thus serve as a guide to the Siugeon. This must then be cut upon, and the apertiue thus made in the gullet enlarged, by means of a probe-pointed bistoiuy, to a suffi- cient size to allow the removal of the extraneous substance. Hard and perfectly indigestible foreign bodies, such as artificial teeth, are sometimes accidentally swallowed dining sleep or an epileptic fit, and, passmg through the pharynx and oesophagus, di-op into the stomach. In these circum- stances, there are two coinses open to the Singeon ; either to endeavour to extract the foreign substance, or to leave it, and allow it to pass, if possible, per anum. I think that the line of practice to be followed should depend on whether the foreign body produce irritation in the stomach or not. If it irritate, giving rise to continued efforts at vomiting, it should, if possible, be extracted. In order to do this, an ivory-baUed probang should ffi-st be passed in to ascertain the situation of the foreign body. After this has been heard and felt, we may adopt the plan successfuUy employed by Little—who removed a hooked plate containing five ai-tificial teeth from the stomach of a woman— of introducing a ‘‘coin-catcher” so as to search for, secure, and then extract it. In doim^ this, there is of course a gveat probability that the mass will be draivn up sideways; and that it may, if broad, hitch in the pharynx, whence it must be detached as weU as the Surgeon can manage by a judicious combination of force and skill. Should the foreign body be small, as a coin, or even angular and sharp-pointed, as a plate mth artificial teeth, and should it not irritateBEMOYAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 623 the stomach, it had better be left to pass thi'ough the intestines, T\Tien it is thus left, the patient should neither take purgath'es nor opiates. Both are injiu-ious : the purgatives by increasing the imtation of the bowels and the chance of their being wounded by sharp and projecting points from the plate ; the opiates by arresting its progress. The better plan is to keep the patient in bed, perfectly quiet, and to give him an abundance of pultaceous food. By adopting this plan I have succeeded in getting a gold plate, with three molar teeth and a sharp cmwed clasj)ing hook at each end, to pass without the slightest difficulty or pain four days after it was swallowed by a gentleman about 25 years of ago. No attempt need ever be made to extract small coins from the stomach, as they viU always easily j)ass through the intestinal canal.624 INJURIES OF THE GUEST. CHAPTEK XXVIII. —♦— INJURIES OF THE CHEST. "WousTDS or THE Chest-Walls are not of sncli frequent occun’ence now as formerly in the days of duelling. The soft tissues may, however, be con- tused, torn, or cut. The thoracic muscles, especially the pectorals, are some- times ruptiu’ed by force applied to the arms when abducted or raised above the head. The great pectoral muscle has been torn in a boy who attempted to drop from hand to hand three rungs of a ladder at a time. Extravasation of blood, and even inflammation and abscess may result from such injury. Subpectoral abscess may occm from injury of the pectoral muscles, or of the areolar tissue beneath, or it may form without any apparent cause. The pus must be evacuated early. This may be done by making an incision through the skin and then tearing through the fibres of the muscles, after the manner recommended by klr. Hilton for the emptying of submuscular or deep-seated abscesses. Abounds of the chest derive their principal interest and importance from the accompanying injmy of the lungs, heart, or larger blood-vessels. When the soft parietes alone are wounded, the injury differs in nothing fr’om similar lesions in other parts of the body ; except that it is usually slover in healing. This is especially the case when the muscular parietes are fruTowed by buUets. If the Surgeon be in doubt whether the cavity of the chest have been pene- trated or not, he may endeavom- to ascertain this point by careful examiuation with the finger ; but he should never introduce a probe ; it is better for him to wait and to be guided in his opinion by the symptoms that manifest them- selves, rather than, by probing the wound, to run the risk of converting it into what he dreads—a penetrating wound of the chest. INJUBIES OP THE LUNG. Contusion oe the Lungs may happen from severe blows on the chest, as from falls from horseback or kicks in the side. It may be comphcated vff fractm-e of one or more ribs, usually at the posterior part. But this is n necessarily a concomitant of the injiuy. The symptoms are as foUows. Mter the receip^t of the blow, the patient is seized with diflflciilty in breatoig, w hic is ant to become paroxysmal, so as to resemble asthma. There is expectoi - tion! at first of mLs rmtingod with blood. On listening to the crenitation with some dulness on percussion, will be foimd towaids t posterior pkrt of the lung.

It is probable that in these cases the lung is ecchymosed at the time of the injury, and that the blood extravasated in its tissue gradually breaks down Avheii it is discharged by coughing in the -s-iscous, semi-coagulated state above described—A'ery different ft-om the florid frothy sputum of recent limg- womid. IluPTURB OF THE LuNO from external violence has • occasionally been observed with, but in some instances wdthout, fracture of the ribs or other sign of injury to the thoracic walls. The symptoms and consequences of such an injury closely resemble, indeed are identical with, those of a wound of the lung ; there being expectoration of frothy blood, pnemno-thorax, perhaps emphysema and subsequent pneumonia. Though very dangerous, these injuries are not necessarily fatal; but recovery may take place as after an ordinary open wound of the lung. WoujS'd of the Lhh& is the most common and one of the most serious complj^atiorrs of injiuies of the chest. It may occur -without any external worrnd, from the ends of a brokerr rib being driven inwards, lacerating the pleru-a and penetrating the pulmonary tissue ; most frequently, however, it happens from a penetrating worrnd of the chest, by stab or bullet. The Ssrmptoms are sufficiently well marked. There is, in the first place, the immediate shock that usually accompanies the infliction of a severe injury, in this case amounting to extreme collapse. The patient is at the same time seized with considerable difficulty of breathing, the resphation being abdo- minal ; this is followed by much tickling and irritating cough, and the expec- toration of fr'othy bloody mucus, or perhaps large quantities of pure blood. If there-be an external opening, the air may pass in and out during the act of breathing; and emphysema, pnerrmothorax, or pnerrmorria will speedily superwene. On auscidtating the chest immediately after the infliction of the irrjirry, a loud rough crepitation will be distinctly audible at and aroimd the seat of lesion. CompHcations.—The principal dangers attending a wound of the lung arise irom the Bleeding, both external and iritermal, the occrurence of Hmmo° thorax. Emphysema, Pneumothorax, Pnermionia, and Empyema. 1.^ The Haemorrhage is usually abundant and often fatal; the patient vomifrng or spitting up a large quantity of florid and frothy blood, by which e might be choked. If it do not prove fatal by the second day, this bloody expectoration generally ceases in a great measure in the course of forty-ei°ht hours, giving way to sputa of a more rusty character. If the external wound le ^e^y free, there may also be copious bleeding from it; but not unfrequently e blood finds its way into the pleural sac rather than through the external apertme, and accmnulates in it ; and death may arise either from the exhaust- internal and concealed hasmoirhage, or fr-om suffocation Afihn u n flungs by the blood in the pleura Although bloody expectoration to some extent at least is an almost necessarv ribf rticirmo ’ystb, occasioned by the projection of broken ’ VOL. seventh day by hmmothorax and pleiuitio6a6 INJURIES OF THE GUEST.

The blood in these cases would ju'obably be infiltrated into the loose tissue of the lung around and above the wound, Avhere it would coagulate so as to offer a barrier against its escape into the bronchi, while it was being poured out where least resistance was offered to it—viz., at the point of injury in the pleura. The symptoms of this internal hmmorrhage, Haemothorax, are those that generally characterise loss of blood, such as coldness and pallor of the surface, small weak pulse, and a tendency to collapse with increasing dyspnoea. The more special signs consist in an inability to lie on the uninjiued side, ndth, in extreme cases, some bulging of the intercostal spaces, and an ecchymosed condition of the posterior part of the wounded side of the chest. The most important signs, however, are those that are furnished by auscultation. As the blood guavitates towards the back of the chest, between the posterior wall and the diaphragm, there will be gradually increasing dulness on percussion in this situation, noth absence of respiratory murmur ; the other portions of the lung, however, admitting air freely. An ecchymosis of the loins described by Valentin, and noticed by Larrey and others, occasioned by the filtration of the blood through the Avound or rent in the pleiua costalis into the areolar tissue of the chest, has been looked upon by some Siu’geons as pathognomonic of hsemothorax ; its importance, however, is secondary to that of the auscultatory signs, as in many cases it has not been met udth, and in others of non-penetrating wounds of the chest it has ocemued. 2. Emphysema, or the infiltration of air into the areolar tissue of the body, and Pneumothorax, or the accumulation of air in the cavity of the pleura, are aiot imfrequent complications of a wounded limg, although not by any means invariably met with. These accidents more commonly occur when the external wound is small and oblique, than when it is large and direct, and often happen in those cases in which the lung is punctiued by a fractiued rib, without there being any external wound. In the majority of cases, emphy- sema and pneumothorax occm- together, but either may be met with sepai’atelj. The mechanism of traumatic emphysema is most commonly as foffoAys. The costal pleura being wounded, and the lung injured, a quantity of air is sucked into thie plemul sac at every inspiration, either through the external wound, or if none exist, from the hole in the limg, thus gnnug rise to pneumo- thorax. At every expiration, the air that thus accumulates in the p eura sac being compressed by the descent of the walls of the chest, is pumped into the areolar tissue around the edges of the wound ; and if this be oblique aiic valvular, being unable to escape wholly thi-ough it, it finds its way at each succeeding respiration further into the large areolar planes, fiijt about the trmik and neck, and eventually, perhaps, into those ol the body geneially. Thouo-h this is the way in which emphysema usually occurs, it may Lo octasid otte™.

Milton has described a form of traumatic emphysema that arises from the ru])turc of an air-cell or bronchus without any external wound. The air, passing into the posterior mediastinum, and finding its Avay along the nerves and vessels in this situation, escapes thi'ough the ccnucal foscia which closes the upper part of the thorax, and thus reaching the neck, diffuses itself along the sheaths of the arteries and nerves, aloi]g which it finds its way into the limbs ; its appearance in which is first indicated by its extending along the course of the vessels. When emphysema is complicated with fracture of the ribs, and the air suiTounds the fractured ends of the bones, I have seen extensive suppuration in the areolar tissue, so that the broken parts of the fractured ribs lay bathed in pus. This will occur when the emphysema is the result of puncture of the lung by the broken rib, vithout any wound in the skin. The Symptoms of Emplujsmna are very distinct. There is a puffy swelling, pale and crackling when pressed upon, at first confined to the neighbour- hood of the wound, if there be one externally ; if not, making its appearance opposite the fractured ribs, and gradually extending over the ipjper part of the truidc and neck. To these parts it is usually limited: in some cases, however, which are happily rare, the swelling becomes more general, the body being blowii up to an enormous size, the features effaced, the movement of the limbs interfered with, respiration arrested, and suffocation consequently induced ; after death, air has been found in all the tissues, even under the .serous coverings of the abdominal organs. In traumatic pneumothorax the auscultatoiy phenomena are very distinctly marked ; there is a diminution or complete absence of the respiratory murmur and of vocal fremitus on the .affected side, with a loud tympanitic resonance on percussion, puerile respi- ration in the soimd lung, and considerable distress in breathing. 3. Pneumonia is an invariable sequence of wound of a lung, and constitutes ■one of the great secondary dangers of this injury; the inflammation neces- •sary for the repair of the Avound in the organ haAdiig frequently a tendency to extend to some distance around the part injured, and not uncommonly to teiminatc in abscess. Traumatic pneumonia resembles in all its symptoms, auscultatory as well as general, the idiopathic form of the disease. There are the ^ same crepitation, duhiess on percussion, and tubular breathiuo as hepatisation advances ; with rusty sputa, much tinged with blood in the early stages. It differs, hoAvever, from the idiopathie form in haAino- less tendency to diffuse itself throughout the lung, and in being limited to the neighbourhood of the part, and to the side that is injured. lienee it may •occur m any part of the hmg—the upper and middle lobes—and only iuA-ades he base of the organ if that happen to be the seat of wound.

If this inflammation run too high, if the constitution be unsound, or if blood or a foreign body be lodged in the cavity of the pleura, there will be effusion often to a A^ery considerable extent. The effused fluid is usually turbid sermn, full of flakes of lymph, which often adhere in large layers to the inside of the chest-wall; it is generally mixed with blood from the Avounded lung. This effusion Avill take place very rapidly, so as to half fill one side of the chest in three or four days. Eventually, there may be suppu- ration. The existence of these effusions of serum and pus mixed AAuth lymph and blood, may be recoginsed by the ordinary auscultatory signs ; dulness on percussion and absence of respiratory murmm- at the lower and posterior parts of the chest, up to a level that has a gTadual tendency to ascend, and that varies according as the patient is upright or recumbent, with ^gophony at the upper border of the fluid, until at last, the whole side of the chest being fiUed Avith fluid, there is complete absence of all breath and voice sounds and of vocal fremitus, AAuth increase of size on measurement, brdging of the intercostal spaces, compression of the lung against the spine ; and, if the left pleura be filled, displacement of the heart towards the right side ; if the right pleima be the seat of the accumulation, descent of the liver below its normal level. When the pleuritic effusion and extravasation reach such a degree as this, there is necessarily great dyspnoea, and death will usually speedily GHSIl.6. Collapse of the Lung in wounds of the chest, consequent upon the action of the atmospheric pressime on the outside of the organ, has been more fi-equently spoken about than seen. The chest may be largely opened, and the fuU pressiu-e of the atmosphere alloAved to act on the outer sm-face of the luno- and yet no collapse of this organ takes place. The lung in such cases may be seen rising and falling at the bottom of the wound. When collapse of the lung occurs in the early stage, it is, I believe, owing to compression by t e air sucked into the cavity of the pleina by pneumothorax. In the latter stages, it may be due to compression by haimothorax or empyema. The Prognosis in wounds of the lungs is necessarfly extremely imfavmn- able but less so than that of similar injuries of most of the other viscera. e dano-er will depend gi’eatly upon the mode of infliction of the wound and it extent. If the lung be wounded by the sharp end of a broken rib, recovciy usually ensues.

S:; of oltott occurring in the Crimean629 TREATMENT OF WOUNDED LUNG. War in the Britislr amij, 120 died ; and iMouat and Wyatt state that, of 200 cases of penetrating- -\vonnds of the chest occurring in the Russian army at the siege of Sebastopol, and treated at Simpheropol, only 3 recovered. The Russian surgeons, however, do not bleed in these cases, but use digitalis instead. Chenu states that, in the French army in the Crimea, of aOS cases of pene- trating -wounds of the chest, 407 were fatal. Longmore remarks that the apparently great mortality in the Crimean returns Avas largely due to the proximity of the field-hospitals to the trenches, AA'here the patients Avere AA'ounded ; if they had been Avounded in the ordinary circumstances of a battle, mimy of them Avould iieA'cr have reached an hospital. The gi-eat danger and principal cause of death in these injiu-ies is unquestionably the haemor- rhage that ensues. This may prove immediately fatal if one of the larger pul- monai-y A'cssels be divided. As the bleeding is most abundant at and shortly after the receipt of the wound, Hennen states that, if the patient siu’A'iA'e the third day, great hopes may be entertained of his recoA'ery. After this period, the chief source of danger is the occiu-rence of inflammation of the lungs and pleiu-a, the extent and severity of which are greatly increased in gun-shot inj.iu’ies by the frequent lodgment of foreign bodies Avithin the chest. The inunediate cause of death at tliis stage is undoubtedly the accumulation of inflammatory dfnsion in the pleiu’al caAuty, as the direct consequence of the pleurisy dcA'eloped by the injiuy. This effusion is often very rapid, and may 231'ove fatal from the foiu’th to the eighth day. Emj)hysema is seldom a dangerous complication, though it may become so if very extensive and allowed to increase luichecked. If both limgs be wounded at the same time, the result is almost ineAutably fatal, either by the abundant hemorrhage suffocating or exhausting the patient, or else by induction of asphyxia in consequence of air being clraAvii into both the pleiu'al sacs, and thus, by comj)ressing the lungs, arresting res- jjiiation. This, however, does not necessarily result; and there are a suflicient numbei of cases on record of recoveries after stab or bullet Avounds traA'ersing both sides of the chest, to shoAV that collajAse of the lungs and consequent asphyxia does not necessarily result from this double injiu-y, which indeed has also been determined experimentally on animals by Cruveilhier. The Treatment of wounds of the chest, imj^licating the lungs, must have reference to A'arious sources of danger that have just been indicated. The Local Treatment is very simple. If the wound have been made by a u et, all foreign bodies that are Avithin reach should be extracted. If there c any difficidty in doing this, it may be necessary to enlarge the apertiu’c ; u t e Surgeon must^ not go too deo2>ly or perseA'eriiigly in search of them, es e excite more in-itation than the foreign body Avould. Light Avater-dress- mg should then be applied, no attempt being made to close the apertm-e, so a the escape of any extraneous substance that may haA’c been left or of extravasated blood, may not be interfered Avith. IftheAvoundbe a clean puncture, Avithout escape of air or much ha3mor- nhsSU u V^^rought together and closed by means of stitches, Enabled bleeding may be arrested, and the patient issuing fieely through it from the iiijiu-ed lung, it should630 INJURIES OF THE CHEST. ]iot 1)C closed, but the patient slioidd be laid on the ■wounded side, and a piece <d' water-dressing applied, otherwise emphysema or hicmothorax will certainly occur. In either case, the wall of the chest on the injured side should be fixed by long- and broad strips of plaster, an aperture being left between the strips opposite to the seat of injury. Monat states that the best results have followed this practice in the army. In wounds of the chest-walls, the intercostal arteries usually seem to- cscape ; or at least, if Avoiuided, they do uot often bleed in a troublesome mauner. Should profuse haemorrhage occur from this source, I believe that the only safe mode of arresting it is to open up the Avound, and, if necessary, to enlarge it so as to roach the bleeding vessel. Should this fail, compression- must bo trusted to. An infinity of devices have been recommended for the- suppression of this kind of htemorrhage ; but they are for the most part more- ingenious than useful and but little applicable to practice, and, indeed, the complication is so rare in chest wounds, that it is needless to describe them. Wounds of the internal mammary artery are rare, considering its exposed situation. They may, hoAvever, occur it the chest be jjeuetrated in front through the intercostal spaces or costal cartilages. The danger in these cases is ft’om the ha3moiThage taking place sloAAdy into the anterior medias- tinum, or into one of the pleurae, AAithout any external bleeding reA'ealing the mischief. If the wound of the A’essel be ascertained, an attempt should be made, by enlarging the external apertme, to seize and ligatme the bleeding- ends, cutting directly doAAii upon them through the injured intercostal space ; or the A’essel might CA'en be foUoAved beneath one of the costal cartilages, if necessary, by cuttina’ through this. Should much blood haAC already been- extraA'asated, this must be removed through the external Avound, by the- introduction of a female catheter, or by the application of a cuppmg-glass oa ei it, and the case then treated like one of effusion into the chest. In the Constitutional Treatment of these injuries, the first indication consists in diminishing the quantity and force of the blood circulating through the lungs, and thus, by lessening the impidse of the heart and increasing the tendency for the blood to coagulate in the spongy pulmonary tissue and smallei- A-essels, to endeavoin to an-est the hteraoiThage from these organs. I he patient must be kept lying on the injm-ed side, and have nothing but ice and barley-water allowed. If the hiemorrhage have been very abundant, the collapse and fainting consequent upon this may tend to induce a natiira cessation of the bleecling, Avhich thus often spontaneously ceases on the sijier- A-ention of syncope. Should the haemoptysis, however, continue or retimi from^ time to time, what should be done ? Here a veiy considerable disorepancy ot opinion exists amongst Surgeons; the question at issue being Avhether a ene- scction should be adopted with the A'iew of restraining the hemorrhage, or the l,atient be treated by rest, low diet, ice, digitalis, ood similar totheelose of tlie Crimean war, tlie most experienced T' “amd moiis ill their opinion, that the patient’s safety lies 111 free >»1“" “ venesection. .John Bell, Hennen, and Giithrie, all concur m ni^ng necessity of ft-ee venesection so as to keep down the ayion ^ arteries, -fflienever this rises and the cough or hajmoptysis letiiins. lecomseTREAT2IENT OF WOUFDED LUNG. 631 sliould be had to the lancet. In the Crimean campaign, Macleod states, that “ those cases did best in which early, active, and repeated bleedings were had recoui-se to.” In the official Ecport of the Medical and Surgical History of the Mar in the Crimea, venesection is advocated Avith equal decision as a means of arresting hajmoptysis. The An-iters state : “When haemoptysis to any con- siderable or dangerous e.xtent is present, A-enesection for the rapid induction of syncope seems not only allowable, but seems to afford the only chance of safety, and may CA’cn require to be repeated.” HoA\^ever paradoxical or even irrational it might at first sight appear to endeavour to restrain one haemor- rhage by establishing another, yet the practice seemed established as the result of experience, and its good effects could be explained by the sudden induction of syncope by the venesection, ghing time for the sealing up of the pulmonary A'cssels by the coagidation of blood Avithin them. But although this Avas the practice up to a comparatively recent period, the vicAvs of military Surgeons on this point seem now to have undergone a com- plete change ; and the experience derived from the great war of the rebellion in America and from the Maori Avar in HeAV Zealand, has led to the promulga- tion of different doctrines and the adoption of a different line of practice. In America, venesection appears to have been generally abandoned, Avhile reliance Avas placed on rest, cold, and oj)ium for the suppression of haemorrhage ; and this practice is said to have been generally satisfactoiy. In Hew Zealand, Mouat states that bleeding Avas almost entirely discarded. Longmore says that, if the patient should surviA'e, the loss of blood by venesection seems to inten-upt the process of adhesion between the pleimal siufaces, and other repara- tiA'e measures adopted by natime, Avhile it induces a condition favourable to gangi-ene, or the formation of ill-conditioned purulent effusions in large amount. In civil practice, I think that, if the patient be young and strong, if the haemoptysis be not so copious as immediately to threaten life and the dyspnoea great, relief will be afforded, and the chance of severe secondary inflammation lessened, by one free venesection. But I do not think that this ought to be repeated, unless at a later stage, to combat inflammation and to relieve dyspnoea arising fr-om the engorged state of the lung and right side of the heart. If the patient surviA^e the third day, the danger to be apprehended is no longer from hmmorrhage, but from inflammation of the lungs and pleiuitic effusion. Military Burgeons formerly recommended venesection as a means both of preA'enting and of reducing inflammation. In modem practice, hoAv- cver, there is a difference of opinion : in the Crimean Avar, there were a number of cases of recovery from lung-wounds AAuthout blood-letting, Avhile in other instances recovery Avas apparently greatly aided by free A’enesection. Long- more remarks that “ more extended statistical informatioir, Avith careful analysis of individual cases, is required before the question of the proper treatment of chest-wounds, so far as A’enesection is concerned, can be considered a settled one. In civil practice, in healthy subjects, if the inflammation be confined to the lungs, and be attended by much dyspnoea, A-enesection Avill often give mucli relief. But Avhen the dyspnoea arises from pleinitic effhsion, bleeding 'must necessarily be useless, and in some cases Avould be decidedly injinious by still nrther Aveakening the poAvers of the patient. The inflammation must also be m ated by a 1 igid diet, and by the admiuistratioir of salines and antimonials.632 INJURIES OF THE GUEST. It may be necessary, however, to support the patient’s strength at the same time that means are employed to reduce the inflammation. In fi'acture of the ribs with Avounded lung, the same line of treatment requires to be adopted; but Avhen the accident occurs in elderly people, we may advantageously sub- stitute calomel and opium, or anunonia and senega, for the antimonials. If extravasation of blood into the pleura be going on, its further effusion must, if possible, be arrested by the same means that are adopted for the stop- IDage of external htemoiThage. When the bleeding has been checked in this way, the blood must early be let out from the pleural sac ; for, if it be allowed to remain there, it will speedily putrefy, gmng rise to extensive formation of pus in the caAdty. In order to prevent this occiu-rence, the wound should be opened freely AAuth a probe-pointed bistoury at the fifth or sixth day after the injiu’y, so that the blood may be discharged. If it do not readily come away, a cupping-glass may be applied over the aperture, and thus it may be AAithdrawn. Should, however, the hmmorrhage continue notwithstanding the employment of the means indicated, Guthrie advises that the wound should be closed, so that the blood that flows into the pleural sac may, by accumulating in this, compress the Imig, and thus arrest the further escape of blood from the wounded vessels; the patient at the same time should be made to lie on the injm’ed side, in order to increase the pressure exercised upon the Avounded organ. On the sixth or eighth day the chest should be tapped, or the wound opened again, in order to evacuate the extravasation, and prevent its acting as an irritant to the pleura, or, by permanently compressing and condensing the lung, rendering this useless. In all cases of purulent effusion into the chest, Guthrie advises, with good reason, that tapping should be early performed, in order that the lung may not be draAATi down by false membranes in such a manner as to be imable to expand, AA'hich Avould lead to permanent flattening of the side and impairment of respiration. If any extraneous body, such as a bullet, a piece of wadding, or of clothing, haA’e penetrated too deeply into the chest to be readily extracted through the external wound, it would not be safe to make incisions or exploratory researches, with a A'iew of extracting it; for, though its presence would increase the patient’s danger, yet attempts at extraction Avould not only add to this, but Avould in all probability be fatal. In many cases, bodies so lodged become surrounded by pus, are loosened, and eventually are spat up, or appear at the external Avound. In other cases, they remain permanently fixed in the chest, becoming enA’eloped in a cyst, and so remaining for years, without producing in’itation. In this way, Hennen states, a bullet has been lodged in the chest for upAvards of twenty years ; and Yidal mentions the case of a man AAho Ihed for fifteen years vdth the broken end of a foil in his chest, Avhich, aftei death, was found sticking in the vertebrm, and stretching across to one of the ribs. The routine system of bandaging or strapping up the chest tightly must not be followed in all cases of fracture of the ribs. Ihere are tAvo conditions in Avhich it is not advisable. The first is, where the fragments of the broken rib are sharp and angular, and, projecting inivards on the pleura and lung, pioc iicc pain, distress, and no slight danger of wounding these striictiu’es it pressed doAvn upon them. Secondly, there are cases AA^hcrc the lung has become com633 HERNIA OF THE LUNG. pressed by tbo effusion of air, serum, or blood into the pleural sac. In such cases, tight bandaging of the chest will produce gTcat distress ; for, the lung on the ilijiu-ed side being, ah-eady rendered useless, or nearly so, as a respn-atoiy organ bv the compression, respiration is altogether canded on by the lung on the unii’ured side. If the chest be uniformly or tightly compressed, the i^e of this lung is also interfered with to such an extent, that a semi-asphyxial condition may ensue. In such cases, rather than bandaging the whole chest, the better plan is to strap up only the injured side from spine to sternum, so as to restrain its movements and leave the sound side free. The Treatment of Emphysema consists of little in addition to what is called for by the wounded lung. In many cases, indeed, the air becomes rapidly absorbed, without the necessity of any local interference. In others, again, the pressiue of a bandage may be required. If, however, the emphysema be so extensiA'c as to interfere with respiration, the external wound, if any exist, must be fr'eely opened, and scarifications made into the areolar tissue, so as to give exit to the air. I doubt whether emphysema alone can ever prove fatal. If, however, both sides of the chest be opened, it is possible that the accompanying pnemnothorax may so interfere with the due expansion of the limgs, as to produce an asphyxial condition that may end in death. Hbexia of the Lueg, oe Pxeumocele.—This is an extremely rare affection. It consists in the protrusion of a portion of the lung at some part of the thoracic walls, so as to form a tumour mider the skin. It has most frequently been met with after an external -wound, under the cicatrix of w'hich the hernial s-weUing has appeared ; but it has been kno-wn to occur from fr-actured ribs without any wound, and even fr’om violent straining dining laboin. I have seen a case in a man who gained his livehhood by playing the comet. In these cases it is probable that, the intercostal muscles and costal pleura ha-^ing been divided or ruptured, by the efforts of the patient, and not having luiited afterwards, the lung has, dining expiration, gradually insinuated, itself into the apertine so formed, until at last the hernial tiunoin has appeared. This protrusion may take place at any part of the thoracic parietes ; thus Yelpeau observed it in the supraclavicular region of a girl ; but most com- monly it occurs on one or other side of the chest. The tumour may attain a large size ; I have heard Velpeau state that he had seen one half as large as the head. It does not appear to shorten life. Almost the only case that has fallen under my observation is one that I saw in 1839, in Velpeau’s wards at La Charitfi; and as the signs of the affection were ivell marked in this case, I may briefly relate it, from notes taken at the time. A man twenty-nine years of age, left-handed, received in a duel a sword-wound at the inner side of, and a little below the left nipple ; he lost a considerable quantity of blood, but did not spit up any. The wound healed in about a fortnight, shortly after which he noticed the tumour, for which he was admitted three months and a half after the receipt of the injury. On examination, an indinated cicatrix about half an inch in length was found a little below, and to the inner side of, the loft nipple. On inspiring or cough- ing, a soft tumour of about the size of an egg appeared immediately underneath the^ cicatrix, -which it raised up ; it subsided under pressure, or when the patient ceased to inspire or to cough ; and its protrusion unght be preventedINJURIES OF THE CHEST. 634 by pressing tlio finger firmly on tlie part \\liere it appeared, when a depression was felt in the intercostal muscles, it the fingers were slid obliquely over the tumoin, it yielded a fine and distinct crepitation, exactly resembling that pro- duced by compressing a healthy lung, and the spongy tissue of the organ could be distinguished. On applying the ear, a fine crackling and rubbing sound was distinctly perceived ; the tumour Avas resonant on percussion. The portion of protruded lung did not appear to re-enter the chest on expiration, but Avas firmly fixed in its neAV situation. Is^o treatment was adopted in the case, nor does any appear admissible in similar instances. The only affection Avith Avhich a hernia of the lung can be confounded, is a circumscribed empyema AA^hich is making its Avay throAAgh the Avails of the chest. Here, hoAvever, the dulness on percussion, and the absence of respira- tory muimur and of crackling under the fingers, Avill readily enable the Surgeon to make the diagnosis. It occasionally happens in extensive Avounds of the chest, that a portion of the lung protrudes during efforts at expiration. If the Avound be free, the protruded lung may return on pressure or during inspiration. If left unretiuned, it soon becomes livid and gangrenous ; in these circumstances it may be removed by the knife or ligatiu’e ; but Guthrie advises that the protruded part should never be separated from the pleura costalis by AA^hich it is siuTOuuded at its base, so that the cavity of the thorax may not be opened ; the woiuid must then be closed in the usual Avay. WOUNDS OF THE HEART AND LARGE VESSELS. Wounds of the Pericardium.—The pericardium may be Avoimded AA'ith or AAuthout penetration of the chest, and AAuth or without injury of the heart. Without Avoiuid of the chest-AvaU, it may be lacerated by a severe contusion ; with penetration of the chest-AA'all, it may be AA^ounded by a stab or by gun-shot. Laceration of the Pericardium may take place from a severe bloAA' on the chest. In this Avay I have seen the membrane split doAvn longitudmally for tAvo or thi-ee inches, from contusion received in a fall. The Pericardium may he wounded by a stab AAdthont the heart being iujin-ed. Thus I have seen a AVOund of the pericardium in a youug man, in- flicted by his sweetheart AA’ith a sharp-pointed pair of embroidery scissors. The pericardium may be bruised or cut by an oblicpis gim-shot aa oiiud Avithout damage to the heart. This I haA'e seen happen Avith a pistol-bullet penetrating the chest obhquely. In injuries such as these, collapse to a greater or less extent is alwa}S met AA'ith.

It must he conducted on those ordinary medical principles that i.-uide us in the maua.o-euient of similar cases arising from other than traumatic causes. A^'ouxJ),s OF THE Hfart.—The heart may receive a wound which does not penetrate through the walls ; or one or more of its cavities may be opened by the ao-ent that inflicts the injmy. Most commonly the wound is inflicted fiy stab or gun-shot, and then generally no foreign body is lodged in the cardiac cavities or substance. But in some instances bullets, as yell as pieces of stick, needles, iron pins, and other substances, have been lodged and encysted in the substance of the ventricles. In the vast majority of cases, woiuids of the heart are immediately fatal, but they are not necessarily or invariably so. Much will depend on whether they penetrate or not into the cavities, and on the extent of the injury that the heart has sustained. Won-Penetrating Wounds may be fatal at once from direct shock to the heart; or the patient may sur-^dve a few hours or days and then die of peri- carditis ; or he may recover and live for years, as in a case reported by West of Birmingham, in Avhich the man lived for four and a half years. After death, enclences of extensive and severe pericarditis Avere found, and there Avas a linear cicatrLx half an inch long in the anterior part of the right A'entricle. Penetrating Wounds of the Heart are almost invariably at once fatal from loss of blood and shock to the organ and system. This is especially the case if the cavities be largely opened, or much of the heart-substance destroyed. But there are many exceptions to this general laAV of fatahty. Jamain has collected 84 cases in AA'hich people have lived for considerable periods after haAing received a Avound of the heart. Of these, in 35 cases the right ventricle was Avounded, and the sufierers lived fi’om four and a half hours to twenty-three days. In 19 cases the injmy Avas to the left ventricle; and of these life was prolonged to periods varying from half an hour, in two cases, to six months in one instance. Both A’entricles were wounded in Aa'C cases in patients li\'ing from one hour to nine and a half months ; the right aiuicle in seven cases, the patients Imng from seven hours to tAventy days ; the left auricle in tAvo cases, in Avhich the patients lived respectfrely one and tAvo days. In many cases, the patient has been knoAvn to walk or to run some considerable distance after the receipt of the injmy. Ollivier and )Sauson have collected 29 cases of penetrating wounds of the heart, Avhich did not prove fatal in the first forty-eight hours after the receipt of the injmy. On analysing these, it Avould appear that the rapidity of death depends greatly on the direction of the AVOund and the part of the organ injured. When the Avound is parallel to the axis of the heart, it is not so speedily fatal as Avhen in a transverse direction, and Avounds of the aiuicle are more immediately folloAved by death than those of the ventricle ; the irregular contraction of the different planes of muscular fibre that enter into” the formation of the Avail of the ventricle tending to obstruct the free passage of636 INJURIES OF THE CHEST. the blood tbrough the -wound, and pcrliaps to close it entirely. The size of the wound, however, will necessarily intluencc the result more materially than its directiom Not only, however, may a person live a considerable time after having received a penetrating wound of the heart, but there arc many cases on record in which life has been prolonged even though a foreign body Averc lodged in the cavities or substance of the organ. Thus Ferrus relates the case of a man ivho lived for twenty days with a skewer traversing the heart from side to side; and Eoux that of a man who lived twenty-one”days with a portion of a file, ivith ivhich he had stabbed himself, in the Avail of the left A'entricle. Davis and Stewart found a piece of wood, three inches long, in the right ventricle of a boy, Avho lived five weeks after the accident had happened; Carnochan relates a case in Avhich the wounded man survived eleven days Avith a bullet deeply lodged in the substance of the apex of the heart; and Latour records the case of a soldier who lived for six years after being Avomided Avith a musket-ball in the side, and in the right ventricle of whose heart the bullet was foiuid lodged, lying against the septum. OUivier, Jamain, West, and especially Fischer, have collected statistics Avith regard to the relative frequency of wounds of the different caAuties of the heart. Fischer has collected 452 cases, in Avhich the right ventricle is stated to have been Avouiided in 123, the left ventricle in 101, and both ventricles in 26. In 28 cases the right auricle, and in 13 the left, was the seat of injury. The apex of the heart was wounded in 17. The reason of the fi’equency of Avound of the right A'entricle is the obAuous anatomical fact that it lies more anteriorly than the left, and hence is more likely to be injured by wounds that penetrate the chest from the front—this being the most common situation of wounds that injure the heart. According to Fischer, in 258 cases the heart was AAmimded from the front of the thorax, in 26 from the abdomen, in 11 fi’om behind, and in 5 fr’om the side. The pericardium is necessarily womided in most cases of AA^omids of the heart. But there are instances on record in which a ball has entered the chest and caused a laceration of the heart-substance Avithout penetrating the peri- cardium, which escaped in consequence of its firmness and fibrous character. Again, as has aheady been stated, the pericardium alone may be injured: Fischer has collected 51 such cases. The Symptoms of a wound of the heart, when immediately fatal, are as follows. The person struck springs up coiwulsively, or falls suddenly prostrate; sometimes Avith, sometimes without, a sudden and sharp shriek. Death results fr’om hmmon’hage, which AA'iU. be profuse, and pass out beyond the pericardium, if the wound be large' and that membrane be widely opened; or hito the pericardium, AAdth choking of the heart from compression, if the Avouud be small. In either case, death 'is hastened by collapse arising fr’oin shock to the central organ of the circulation itself, and to the system at large from the wound of so important an organ. If the Avound be small and death be not immediate, there are eAudenccs of great shock in the intense depression of vital poAver, the pallid and anxious countenanee, and the relaxation of the limbs. The aetion ol the heart itselt is tumultuous, Aveak, and irregular ; the pulse is scarcely perceptible ; the breathing is frightfully embarrassed. If the patient siu'vive a few days, these637 liUPTUliES OF THE HEART. spnpfcoms partially and intermitting-ly subside ; and the ordinary auscnltatory signs of pericarditis come on—friction and creaking sounds, with diminished and distant impulse, and perhaps widely spread dulness in percussion. To these may possibly be added evidences of endocardial inflammation. Of these consecutive inflammatory complications and of their consequences the patient Avill most probably ultimately die, though perhaps at a remote period and after prolonged suffering. Ruptures of the Heart from External Violence, without penetrating wounds of the chest, arc not of frequent occuiTcnce. Gamgee has, however, collected 27 published cases of this accident. On analysing these he finds that, in at least one half of the cases, the pericardium was intact; 12 of the ruptures were on the right, 10 on the left side. The right ventricle was ruptured in 8, and the left in 3 cases ; whereas the left auricle was torn in 7, and the right only in 4 instances. Death is usually nearly instantaneous, though there are instances on record in w'hich the patient has made some exertion after the ruj)- tm-e had taken place, and has even lived for several hoiu’s. In a case of raptime of the right auricle recorded by Rust, the patient survived foiu’teen hours. In most of the recorded cases, the injury occasioning the ruptiue was directly applied to the region of the heart. But instances are not wanting in which this organ has been found ruptured through one or both ventricles or in one of the am-icles, without any evidence of direct injury in the cardiac region—the patient having fallen upon his head or shoulders, or having been merely thrown forcibly to the gTound with serious injury to the lower extremities. In some of these cases, there is reason to beheve that the ruptiue w^as produced by the spasmodic violence of the contractions of the heart, under the influence of great mental emotion or fear. The only case that has occiured in my practice was that of a man brought into the Hospital dead, having fallen from the top of a cart. The right shoulder was bruised, and the clavicle broken—showing- clearly that he had pitched on that side ; there w^as no other bruise about the body, or evidence that the wfieels had passed over him. On examination, the liver was found extensively torn, in fact smashed, and the pericardium was distended with blood—there being a triangular ragged apertiue at the anterior part of the auricular appendage of the left auricle, through which it had escaped. Wounds of the Aorta and Vena Cava ai-e usually as immediately fatal as those of the heart itself. In this respect, they resemble wmimds of the auricles rather than those of the ventricles. Heil has, how'ever, recorded a case in w'hich the patient recovered and lived for a tw'elvemonth, after receiving a stab that penetrated the ascending aorta.63S IXJIJRJES OF THE ABDOMEN AND FELVJS. CHAPTER XXIX. INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVI8. INJUBIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND ABDOMINAL VISCERA. Injuries of the abdomen occiu- frequently. They may be dhided into Contusion of the Abdomen, with or without Euptme of Internal Organs; Non-penetrating Woimds ; and Penetrating Wounds, either imcomplicated, or conjoined with Injmy or Protrusion of some of the Organs contained in this cavity. Contusions of the Abdominal Walls from blows or kicks usually ter- minate without serious inconvenience, but in some cases are followed by very acute peritonitis, which may prove fatal. In other cases, the abdominal muscles may be ruptm-ed, although the skin may remain unbroken. A man was admitted under my care into the Hospital, having received a blow from the buffer of a railway carriage upon his abdomen. He complained of great pain at one spot ; and, on examination after death, we found the rectus muscle torn across vdthout injmy either to the integu- ments or the peritoneum. If the patient live, an injury of this kind is apt to be followed by atrophy of the muscular substance, and perhaps by the occur- rence of a ventral hernia at a later period. Occasionally the contusion is followed by abscess in the abdominal wall, which has a tendency to extend widely between the muscular planes. The abscesses should be opened early, lest they burst into the peritoneal cavity and occasion fatal inflammation. Buffer-Accidents.—A contusion of the abdomen is often associated with Ilupture of some of the Viscera. In military practice these internal injm-ies are met with in the so-called wind-contusions ; ” in civil practice they commonly result from blows, kicks, the passage of a cart-wheel over the abdomen, or the squeeze of the body between the bufters of two railway carriages! These “ Buffer-accidents ” are of common occurrence in hospital practice, resulting usuaily from the carelessness of railway guards and portem, who, trying to pass between carriages in motion, are caught and squeezed between the buffers. In these cases the most fearful internal injunes occur, often Avithout any external rvound. A man was admitted under iny care into University College Hospital, in whom the liver, stomach, spleen, and kidneys, were crushed and torn ; the heart was bruised, being ecchymoscd on its sur- face and one of the lungs was lacerated, without any rupture or liruisc ot t re skill or fracture of the ribs. In this way any of the abdommal organs may be torn or contused, the particular one injiu'cd depending on the situation ot the blow. The organ that is most frequently crushed 111 this way is the liver.liUrTUEE OF ABDOMIXAL 639 VISCERA. owing to its large size and the unyielding nature and ready lacerability of its structure ; the other solid organs, such as the spleen and kidneys, do not suffer so frequently : the pancreas I ha^-e never seen injm-ed. Among the hollow organs the stomach most commonly suffers, and it is especially likely to do so if struck while distended by food. Any portion of the intestinal canal may be lacerated. I ha^'e seen the duodenum, the ileum, the jejunum, and the large intestine ruptured in different cases : the mesentery likewise may be torn, and the spermatic cord snapped across. The sufferer usually dies in the coiu'se of a few hours, or at the utmost at the end of two or three days after the receipt of these severe injuries, from hfemorrhage into the abdominal cavity, conjoined with shock. It is seldom that life is prolonged sufficiently for peritonitis to be set up, though this is the chief danger to be aiDprehended in those cases that survive the more immediate effects of the accident. The shock of itself may prove fatal, though there be but little apparent intcnial mischief ; thus, I have seen a man die collapsed eight hours after a buffer-accident, in whom no injury was found except a small rupture of the mesentery, attended with but very shght extravasation of blood. The severity of the shock, amounting often to prolonged and complete collapse, is one of the most remarkable phenomena attending these injuries. It is difficult to account for it, except on the supposition that it is due to wound or concussion of the great sympathetic nerve and its large abdominal ganglia. To whatever cause it may be referred, it is certain that it is greater than that which follows a corresponding injury, imattended by loss of blood, of any other part of the body except the central portions of the cerebro-spinal nervous system. The continuance of the shock may be maintained, and its intensity increased, by the syncopal effect of internal hemorrhage, -which, when the solid organs are ruptured, is the most common cause of death. So far as my experience goes, I would say that the shock is most severe in inj rules of arrd about the stomach, probably from damage to the great solar plexus. Hemorrhage is the most usual cause of death wherr the liver arrd spleeir are rrrptrued ; and the patieirt usually dies of acute peritorritis wherr the irrtestine has been tom across. It does rrot follo-w, however, that these injrules are necessarily fatal. Patients have lived after all the signs of rrrjrture of the kidney, the passing of bloody urine, arrd the preserree of circrrmscribed peri- tonitis, and, when death has occurred at a later period, cicatrices have been detected in the orgarr. A patient was admitted urrder my care irrto the Uni'S ersity College Hospital for a severe blow upoir the back from the buffer of^ a railway carriage, followed by htematuria and other symptoms of rerral injury ; on his death fr’om pnerrmonia rrine weeks after the acciderrt, arr extra- vasation of blood, with the marks of receirt cicatrisation, was forrrrd irr the left kidney. Iiirpture of the liver is by no means-speedily or even rrecessarily .fatal. It may be, and rrsually is so, from great extravasation of blood or of bile ; but if neither of these be largely poured out, the patient may live for some consider- mile time, though ho may eventually succumb to traumatic peritonitis A man was once admitted under my care into the University Colleo-e Hosnital - .0 had been crushed between the butters of two railway Lria4 He collapsed and apparently moribund, Imt rallied in a few houil Two days640 INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. after the accident, great pain and tenderness in the right iiypochondrinm Avcrc complained of, and dulness on percussion was found to extend as low as the umbilicus. He became jaimdiced, and there were symptoms of low peritonitis; these were follou’ed by great swelling of the abdomen, Avhich became tym- panitic ; the peritonitis continued, and symptoms of intestinal obstruction cimie on, the dulness increasing, Avith fluctuation in the flanks. He died on the sixteenth day after the accident, and on examination no loss than 240 ounces of bilious fluid, mixed Avith flakes of lymph, Avere found in the abdominal cavity; the obstruction of the bowels being dependent on the prossm-o of this effusion, and on the matting together of the intestines by lymph. There AAms a large rent in the thick border of the liver, which Avas beginning to cicatrise.' Injury over the region of the liver, probably occasioning laceration of that organ, folloAved by peritonitis and jaundice, may be recovered from. Of this I have had several instances in my oaati practice. The foUoAving is a good example. A man, about forty years of age, fell from a scaffold to the ground. In falling, he struck violently against a beam, injuring his abdomen on the right side. He was brought to the Hospital in a state of collapse, fr’om which he sloAA’ly rallied. There was no injury but that of the abdomen, of which he complained much, more particularly over the region of the hver, which Avas A'ery tense. Peritonitis speedily set in, AAuth gi-eat tympanitic distension of the belly, vomiting of bilious matter, and the passage of uncoloured stools. These symptoms continued many days, and the man became jaundiced. As the tympanites subsided, it was found that there was dulness on percussion in both flanks, and that the fluid, which Avas evidently extravasated into the peritoneal cavity, rose to a level with the umbilicus when he lay on his left side, which he did habitually. He was treated Avith opium, and put on a very mild unstimulating diet. He gTadually but slowly recovered, the vomitings becoming less frequent, and eventually ceasing, and the fluid in the abdomen being slowly absorbed, bile at the same time appearing in the motions ; but the tenderness over the region of the liver continued up to the time at which he left the Hospital, nearly two months after the accident. ^ In this case the long and severe collapse, the seat of pafri and injmy, the peritonitis, the bilious vomitings, and the white stools, all pointed to serious injiuy of the liver and the intestines; and rapid intra-abdominal extravasation could only be accounted for by rupture of that organ. _ ^ The Symptoms of an internal abdominal injiny are often extremely eqmvoca., and Avill necessarily vary according to the organ injured. If the Spleen have been lacerated, there will be all the effects of severe shock of the system, accompanied by those of internal hemorrhage; coldness, and pallor of the sinface, a smaU and feeble pulse, anxiety of countenance, and gi-eat depression of the vital powers, Avith pain at scat ol ^ perhaps dulness on percussion from extraA’asated blood. These symptou speedily terminate in death. j. fmvws H the Kiilneye he injured, there trill commonly be a Irequen desne to pass mine, and this rviU be tinged avith blood, often to a After the discharge of blood ceases, the nrmeav.il ™ ^ may continue so tor a great length of time. On exanuning such ..IbmnmonEMrilYSEMA OF THE ABDOMINAL WALL. 64F «vinc under the microscoi:)C, it will generally be found to contain a few blood- •corpuscles and possibly some casts of tubes, wtli mucous and epithelial scales, shoeing the existence of inflammation in the kidney. It is a remarkable and important practical fact that, so flir as my experience goes, I have never seen idbumen in the urine as the result of renal injury, unless it had been pre- ceded by blood. The absence of blood from the urine must not, however, be taken as an indication that the kidney is not injured ; it may be so dis- organised as to be totally incapable of secreting, and consequently no bloody urine finds its way into the bladder. A man was admitted into the Hospital under my care for a butfer-injury of the back ; he passed mine untinged Avith •blood, but after death his right kidney was found completely smashed by the blow, and there Avas an extensiAO extravasation of blood in the cellulo-adipose tissue around it; here it aaus evident that the disorganisation Avas so sudden mad complete that no urine could find its way into the bladder. In another case, in consequence of a fall from a AvindoAV, aai elderly man died in the course of n,ii hoim, having struck his back and sustained several fractiu’es of the limbs. The left kidney was ruptm’ed in a starred manner, with extensiA-e extravasation of blood into the tissues around it, but there Avas not a tinge of blood in the mine which AA’as retained in the bladder. If the Liver have been ruptured, pain over the region of that organ, dulness -on percussion from extravasated blood, and great collapse followed, if the patient live, by diffused traumatic peritonitis, bilious vomitings, white stools, and jaundice, Avill, with sufficient precision, indicate the true iiatm-e of the injury. Bernard has further shown that contusions of the IHer are followed by traumatic saccharine diabetes. When the Stomach is ruptured, the natm-e of the accident is usually revealed by bloody voimting ; and Avhen the Intestines have been tom, by the admixtm’e of blood with the stools, if the patient live long enough to pass any. These signs, however, do not occur in all cases. A man AA^as admitted to the Hospital under my care, whose abdomen had been squeezed between a cartwheel and a lamp-post; dming the five hours that he lived he vomited several times, bringing up a meal which he had taken immediately befoi’e the accident. In the A’omited matters there was no blood to be seen ; but on examination after death it was found that not only the liver and spleen Avei’e ruptmed, but the stomach Avas torn almost completely across near the pyloms. Emphysema of the Abdominal Wall, and subsequently of the trunk generally, may result from the escape of flatus from Avounded intestine into the subperitoneal areolar tissue, and thence into the more superficial planes. When this takes place, the same doughy, puffy, inelastic, crepitating swelling of the subcutaneous areolar tissue, that is met with in thoracic emphysema, is obserA-ed. t usually commences in one or the other flank, and may tlren creep up towards the axilla, or in fr-ont of the abdominal Avail. As a diagnostic sign, this form of emphysema is valuable in those cases in w ici he mtestines have been injured, either Avithout any u^omid of the < jc omma parietes, or, if there be wound, without protrusion of the iiiinred portmn of s„t. two of tbo cases i,. which I l!avo obsen-ed rthis co'^ ion Mas the only positive sign of intestinal injury. In one case, the transA-erse T TINJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 642 duodenum had been ruptured where uiicoyered by peritoneum, l)y a buffer- accideut ; and, in the other the rectum and meso-rcctum had been traversed by a pistol-ljall. In both these cases the emphysema was extensiA'c, the flatus having’ directly passed into the subperitoneal areolar tissue. In other cases it may in the first instance pass into the cavity of the abdomen, and render that tympanitic, and then, as in thoracic emphysema after pnemnothorax, escape- into the areolar tissue at the edges of the Avound. In a case under my obsei’A-a- tion, it occniTcd after tapping the bladder through the rectum. The flatus escaped, after the removal of the cannula on the sixth day, through the small aperture in the Avails of the gnt into the subperitoneal areolar tissue of the pelvis, thence, through the sciatic notches, doAAm the posterior and outer part of the thighs and the flanks. The diagnosis of abdominal emphysema from thoracic emphysema and from putrefactiA’e infiltration of air into the areolar tissue requires to be made. In the first case, the diagnosis may readily be effected by obsemng an absence of the signs of thoracic injury, and by the situation of the emphysema in the posterior or lateral abdominal wall, or around the lips of a Avound. From putrefactive infiltration Avith air, the abdominal emphysema is easily distin- guished by the cause, and by the absence of Ioav inflammation of the arcolar tissue. The Treatment of the various injm’ies of the abdomen that have just been described is very simple. If the symptoms indicate laceration of one of the A’iscera, little can be done during the state of collapse supervening on the accident, beyond keeping the patient quiet, and employing the means that have been recommended for lessening the effects of shock. If the patient surAuve this period, we must guard against peritonitis, and hmit, if possible, the extra- A-asation of blood into the abdomen, should there be indications of its occiuTence, by the employment of treatment that Avill presently be described. Wounds of the Diapheaom may be occasioned by stabs or by gun-shot injiUT. Sometimes, however, this muscle is perforated by the fragment of a broken rib without external Avound. The lesion, though not in itself mortal, is necessarily usually complicated with so much Ausceral injuiy as to be very generally followed by death. If the patient sm-vive, the aperture may be blocked up by a false membrane, to which the adjacent lung Avill probably adhere ; and thus the separation between the cavities of the chest and abdo- men vdll be maintained. Should this reparative action not take place, a henna protrusion of some of the abdominal viscera may take place into the pleura caAuty, as will be more fully described when we speak of ‘ Diaphragmatic Wounds of the AuDOMEN.-Wounds of the Abdominal Wall that do not penetrate the Peritoneal Cairity, if luicomphcated with intenial lujuiy, usually do well, and merely require to be treated on ordmaiy principles.

Wounds that Penetrate the Cavity of the Abdomen are of especial interest, on account of the frequency with which they are complicated with peritonitis, and with injury of the A'iscera. Tlicy may, for practical purposes, be divided into 1, those that Penetrate the Peritoneal Sac, without wounding or causing the protrusion of any of the contained organs ; and 2, those that are complicated with Protrusion or AVound of some of the Viscera. 1. Penetrating Wounds of the Abdomen, without Visceral Pro- trusion or Injury, are often somewhat difficult to distinguish from simple wounds of the abdominal wall, though the escape of a small quantity of reddish serum may reveal the nature of the accident. In these cases the Sui'geon should be careful not to push his examination too far, by probing or otherudse ex- ploring the wound, lest he really perforate the peritoneum which was previously intact. The cavity of the peritoneum has often been perforated from front to back by bullet-wounds or sword-thrusts, without there being any sign of visceral injury. In the absence of peritonitis or other signs of mischief, the wound must be treated as a simple one of the abdominal wall, and any com- plication that may occur must be met in the way that will immediately be described. 2. In a Penetrating Wound with. Protrusion or Injury of the Viscera, the risk is necessarily greatly increased; here the chief danger is from peritonitis, induced either by the wound, by the extravasation of the intestinal contents into the peritoneal cavity, or by the accumulation of blood in it. It but seldom happens that death results from hEemorrhage in these cases, though this may, of course, occur if any of the larger vessels be injured. Protrusion of uninjured intestine, mesentery, or omentum may take place through the wound in the abdominal wall. This protruded mass is always very large in comparison with the aperture from which it escapes, the sides of which, being overlap by it, constrict it rather tightly, so as to form a distinct neck to the protrusion. If left unreduced, the mass speedily loses its polish and bnght colour, becoming dull and livid fi-om congestion ; it then inflames, and soon becomes gangrenous from the pressime exercised upon it by the sides of the aperture through which it has passed. In many cases the protruded intestine is tvounded. The existence of this forther injiuywill readily be ascertained by the escape of flatus, or of the more fluid contents of the gut. ^ The characters of the wound vary, as Travers has pointed out, according to its size. If it be a mere punctime, or even an incision two or three lines in length, eversion or prolapsus of the mucous membrane VI take place, so as to close it sufficiently to prevent the escape of the con- n s. f the aperture be above four lines in length, this plugging of it by everted raucous membrane cannot take place, and then the contents of the )owe are more freely discharged ,• but, even in these circumstances, there will ne a tendency to the protrusion of the membrane, which forms a kind of lin over the edge of the cut. 1 notp-otrude, but remains ivitbui the peritoneal exhib, s the same phenomena. In these cases, however, there is the p1ri“r- f conUrinro the ti.nt-r. ' ^^ticnasatiou, unquestionably one of the greatest dauo’or'’ aat can oecnr ,n wounds of the abdomen, inasmuohasby itshiit^tquaS T T 2INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. C44 the feculent matter gives rise to and keeps up tlie most intense peritonitis, takes place less frequently than might he expected. For this tliere are soA'cral reasons. In the first place, as we haA-e ah’eady seen, if the wound in the gut he helow a certain size, there is a natural tendency to its occlusion l>y eversion of the mucous membrane. Besides this, it must l:)e home in mind that, though in ordinary language Avc speak of the “cavity” of the abdomen, there is in reality no such thing ; there being no empty space Avithin the peritoneal sac, hut the whole of the Aisceral contents of the abdomen being so closely and equably brought into contact by the pressure of the abdominal muscles and of the diaphragm, that it requires some force for the intestinal contents to over- come this uniform support, and to insinuate themsetoes between the coils of contiguous portions of intestine. The influence exercised by the continuous pressure of the abdomiual walls upon the intestinal contents, is Avell shown by the greater facility with which these escape from a portion of woimded intes- tine that has been protruded, than from one that is still lying Avithin the abdo- men. In the former case, feces will escape from a much smaller aperture than ill the latter, in consequence of the gut not being supported on all sides by the uniform pressure to which it is subjected within the abdomen. It is seldom, indeed, that feces are extravasated from gut that is not protruding, unless it be very full at the time of the injury, or the wound in it be very extensive. The influence of the equable pressure of the abdominal contents in preventing the escape of feces was well illustrated in a case in University College Hospital, of a man who was shot through the abdomen.

Th#patient should then have a full dose of opium; about two grains of solid opium or forty minims of the liquor sedativus, which must bo repeated in from four to six hoiu’S, so that the elfccts may be kept up. I prefer in these cases the solid opium, of which as much as fr-om six to eight grains may be given in twenty-four hom'S. The patient should be kept perfectly quiet in bed, and no nourishment given for a few days, except barley-water and ice. The bowels should not be opened by aperient medicine, lest abdominal irritation be set up, but oleaginous enemata may be administered at the end of a week or ten days. If the intestine he wounded but not protruding, we must endeavoiu’ to limit the peritonitis that will ensue, and also to prevent feculent extravasation. The patient shoidd be laid on the injiu’ed side vdth the wound dependent, so as to allow the fteccs to escape thi’ough it, if disposed to do so. If the injury be about the umbilicus, he must lie upon his back with the knees drawn up and bent over a pillow. Opium must then be administered in the fuU doses already indicated, and repeated in gi-ain doses at least every fourth or sixth hour, so that the system may be kept well under its influence. The value of opium in these cases is very great; it not only seems to moderate the inflam- mation of the peritoneum, but is of the greatest utility in preventing extrava- sation of feces. This it does by arresting the peristaltic movement of the intestine, and thus keeping it from change of position. This arrest of the intestinal movements also tends greatly to the closure of the wound. Travers has shown experimentally, and his investigations have been confirmed by subsequent observations on the human subject, that wounds of the intestines are closed by lymph that is thrown out, not only from the contiguous peritoneal smfaces of the part actually injured, but fr’om that of neighboiuing coils ; so that the apertiwe in the gut becomes permanently glued and attached to the structures in its vicinity. In order that this process should take place, it is necessarily of importance that the movements of the bowels be paralysed ; and it is a beautifril provision of natm’e that the very inflammation which closes the wound, arrests that peristaltic action, the continuance of which w'ould interfere with its agglutination to, and closure by, the neighboiuing parts. Until, therefore, the necessary degree of inflammation to effect this is set up, the intestinal movements must be arrested by opium. If extravasation of feculent matter have taken place into the abdomen, an attempt may be made to facilitate its escape externally by removing the stitches and plasters, and placing the patient ou the injiued side, so that this may be most dependent; should the lips of the wound have ah’eady become adherent to one another, they may even be gently and carefuUy separated by the introduction of a probe, and in this way an outlet afforded for the effused matters. When a portion of intestine or of omentum has protruded, it should c replaced as speedily as possible, before strangulation has occurred, which may occasion gangrene. The alidominal muscles should be relaxed by bending c igh upon the abdomen, when the Siugeon may gradually push back the646 INJUBIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND BELVJS. protrusion by steady pressure upon it; he must not, hoAvevor, employ any force, nor any rough liandliiig of the exposed and delicate parts; but if their return cannot readily be elfected, owing to the constriction of the neck of the tumour, the apertime through which they have escaped must be carefully enlarged in a direction upwards, by means of a probe-pointed bistoiuy, or a hernia-knife guided by a flat director. The incision necessary to enlarge the opening sufli- ciently for reduction, need not exceed half an inch in length. In replacing the protruded parts, whether by the aid of incision or not, care must be taken that they are fairly put back into the cavity of the abdomen, and not pushed up into the sheath of the rectus, or into the subserous areolar tissue lying before the peritoneum ; an accident that would be fatal by allowing the constriction of the neck of the protrusion to continue unrelieved. In eifectiug the return, the Siugeon should not push liis finger into the abdomen, but must content himself-with simply replacing the protruded gut or omentum, and allowing it to remain in the immediate neighbourhood of the wound in the abdominal wall, to which it will contract adhesions ; and through which its contents may escape, in the event of any sloughing being set up in it. If the protrusion be inflamed, it must equally be replaced without delay ; but should the intestine have become gangrenous from continued constriction and exposiue, no attempt at reduction should be made, but an incision must be canied through it, so as to allow the escape of faeces, and the formation of an ai’tificial anus. If the protruded omentum'^ be gangrenous, it must be excised on a level with the pp.Titnnp.nm, to the apertm’e in which that portion lying within the abdomen wiU have contracted adhesions. If the intestine that protrudes he wounded, the treatment of the aper- ture in the gut mil call for special attention ; and Siugeons have been some- what divided as to the question of the propriety of stitching it up. Scarpa and S. Cooper were opposed to this practice on the ground that it does not jDrevent extravasation, and that the stitches produce iiritation by acting as foreign bodies. They proposed to return the woimded gut, taking care, how- ever, to leave the aperture in it to correspond with that in the abdominal wall, so that an artificial anus might be established by the adhesion of the edges of the openings to one another, and by that means prevent extravasation. To this practice the great objection exists, that extravasation will probably occur before there has been time for the effusion of lymph, and the agglutination of the contiguous surfaces ; besides which, it is impossible to secm’e the necessary con-espondence between the two apertm-es, the wounded gut being very liable to alter its position after it has been replaced. It has also been found by experience that one of the objections m’ged against the employment of a suhue, that it camiot prevent the escape of feculent matter, is not valid. If it be properly applied, it may effectually do so, as was shown by a successful case under my care, the details of which were pubhshed in the Lancet tor 18al. That the stitches act as sources of irritation to any extent, is also doubtlul. Travers foimd by experiment that, when a wounded gut was sewn up, and returned into the abdomen, the sutiues quickly became bridged or coated over with a thick layer of lymph, and, gradually ulcerating them way inwards, at last di'opped into the cavity of the intestine, being dischcUgec jic/ leaving a firm cicatrix at the point to which they liad been app lec. 01 1 \647 TJIEATMEXT OF WOUNDED INTESTINE. various reasons, (lutlirie, Tra^'ers, and other Surgeons of experience, advocate the practice of stitching np the wonnd in a protruding intestine in suitalde cases, with which opinion I entirely agree. It is, ho^vever, evident that no positi\-e and inivaryiug rule can be laid down that is applicable to all cases. .Much must depend on the nature, cause, and extent of the wound in the gnt. If it be very lai-ge and transverse, the result of gun-shot violence or other con- tusing force, no suture can be of any service ; for, not only might it be difficult to bring the edges together, but they wmdd probably not adhere to one another, nor to the abdominal wall. If, however, the wound be punctured or incised mid of moderate extent, the case is different. Much will also depend upon the way in Avhich the sutines are applied. They should bo introduced by means ■of a fine round needle, armed with sewing silk, in such a way that the perito- neal sinfaces on each side of the womid are brought into contact: adhesion takes place solely between these, the wound in the other structines of the gut filling np by plastic deposit. It has been recommended that the needle should penetrate the peritoneal and nreolar coats oidy, no muscular tissue being iaken np in it, lest retraction of the included fibres, by di’agging uj)on the stitches, might re-open the wound. This ad^'ice, however, it is extremely difficult to follow. The safer plan is doubtless to cany the sutine thi-ough the whole thickness of the gut, bringing the pjg_ ,61 - stitches out at about one-sixth of an inch from the edge of the cut, in such a way that the serous surfaces are drawn into iipposition. The kind of sutine that should be used is here represented (Fig. ^61). When the lips of the wound have been nearly brought into apposition in this way, it has been proposed to leave the end of the thread hanging out of •the aperture of the abdominal wall, and to withdraw it when it becomes loose ; but I think it better not to leave it, as it might induce great irritation, acting like a seton in the peritoneal cavity. The ends, therefore, should be cut short close to the knot, when the suture will eventually become covered with lymph, mid find its way into the inside of the gut by ulcerating through the muscular mid mucous coats. Should the aperture in it admit of being thus closed, the protruded jiortion ■of the intestine must be reduced, having previously been properly cleansed with a little lukewarm water. Should, however, the protruded gut be too ■extensively torn, and especially if it be lacerated by gun-shot injury, it would be useless to stitch it np, and it must be gently and^ carefully reduced. The reduction must be effected in the way that has been already described, the ■Sm-geon being especially careful not to push the wounded coil of intestine fin- into the abdoinen, but to leave it close to the external orifice, so that, in the ■cient of extravasation occiuring, or the stitches giving way, a ready outlet may be afforded. Should the womid in the abdominal wall be extensive, it must be closed by sutines and plasters, supported by a bandage, tlie interior angle being left open to allow the escape of extravasation.

Care must be taken, by attention to the position of the patient, and by the free administra- tion of opium, to keep the bowel as quiet as possible near the external opening the mine should be ebawn off tmee iu the twenty-four hoius, and no purgative- whatever administered, lest by the excitation of peristaltic action adhesion be disturbed, and extravasation take place. After the lapse of six or eight days, an enema may be throwm up, and repeated from time to time. No food should be allowed for the first tln-ee days, during which time ice and barley-water should be freely taken ; after this, beef-tea, and light food that leaves no solid residue, may be given. It is of great importance that no solid food should be administered for at least two or three weeks after the occurrence of the injury.. In a case of wound of the intestine which was under my care, the patient, Avho. Avas progi’essiug very favomably, and eventually recoA^ered, nearly lost her life by eating the pulp of an orange on the tenth day. Traumatic Peritonitis is the great danger to be apprehended in all serious injuries of the abdomen, and it is by inducing this that extravasation of ffeces or of blood so fr’equently proves fatal. It is true that a certain degree of inflammation of the peritoneum is necessary for the heahng of all abdominal Avounds, but it must be limited in extent and plastic in character. It is the more diffuse form of peritonitis, attended by the exudation of tm-bid serum and shreddy ill-conditioned lymph, that is so speedily fatal. In these cases,. Ave meet with the ordinary symptoms of the idiopathic form of this affection uniform tenderness about the abdomen, but more particularly in the neighboin- hood of the injury, Avith occasional stabbing pains, followed by tympamtic. distension, vomiting and hiccup, a smaU, quick, hard pulse, often assuming a Aviry incompressible character, Avith considerable pyrexia, and great anxiety of coimtenance. This diffuse traumatic peritonitis Avill set in and nm its course- Avith great rapidity. In a case in University CoUege Hospital, already alluded to, of bullet-AVOund of the abdomen, the patient hA-ed tAventy-fom hours. Two or three pints of serous effusion with much puro-plastic matter Avere found ; and great reddening of the whole of the Aisceral and much of the paiietal peritoneum had ensued. In another case of ruptiu’e of the ileiun, the conse- cutive peritonitis proA’ed fatal in about thirty hom’s after the accident. This extreme rapidity in its comse and fatal termination, distinguishes traumatic from idiopathic peritonitis. To what is the rapid fatality of traimiatic peritonitis due ? It does not, as in the case of traumatic inflammations of the head and chest, cause death by the direct interference Avith organs, the healthy perform- ance of Avhose action is directly essential to the continuance of life. It is also far more rapidly fatal than any inflammation of the plema, peiicai’diimi, 01 arachnoid. May it not be due to some direct impression upon the sympathetic ganglia—to the collapse of nervous shock, associated Avith and intensified by an acute contiguous inflammation ? In some cases the disease assumes a moic chronic form ; and recovery occasionally takes place. In the less acute oim!> ol‘ the disease, where life is prolonged for many days or several weeks, effusion649 IIUPTURE OF THE BLADDER. of (lark or turbid serous fluid takes place iu the peritoueal cavity. As this cflusioii increases, dulness on percussion Avill manifest itself—usually first on the flanks, and then gradually extending forward until it may occupy a gTcat extent of surface in the abdomen. In the Tmtlmenl of this disease, we must be guided by the character of tho inflammation. If it be sthenic, and the patient young and robust, he may be- bled in the arm, but should certainly have leeches abundantly applied over the surface of the abdomen ; a pill, composed of two grains of calomel and one grain of opium, may then be administered eveiy sixth hour, or oftener if the patient be not influenced by the narcotic ; and rigid abstinence from food should be enforced, ice and barley-water alone being allowed. If the perito- nitis bo the result of a wounded intestine, it is safer to omit the calomel, using instead mercurials to the inside of the thighs, but giving opium freely. When the peritonitis occurs in an old or feeble subject, our principal trust must bo in the administration of opium and in free leeching of the abdomen, followed perhaps by a blister, which maybe dressed with mercurial ointment. In these cases, liowever, early support will be required, 'with perhaps the administration of wine or stimulants. The inflammatory extravasation will gradually bo absorbed under the influence of the calomel, aided by bhsters. INJUBIES OP THE PELVIC VISCERA. Bladder.— Rupture of the Bladder, from blows upon the abdomen, is not of very unfrequent occiUTence. It can scarcely happen when the organ is empty, as it then sinks down imder cover of the pelvic bones. But when the bladder is greatly distended, rising high above the pubes, and thinned propor- tionately to its distension, it may very readily be ruptured, even by very slight degrees of external violence, as by one man rolhng over another in a clrnuken scuffle, or by a person running against a post, or falling out of bed. The Effects of this iujiuy vary considerably, according to the part that has given way or been wounded. If the laceration have occurred iu those portions, of the viscus'that are invested by peritoneum, the lu-ine will at once escape into the pehlc and abdominal cavities, and speedily occasion death by intense in’itation and inflammation. I have, however, seen a case in which, even in these circiunstances, the patient survived ten days. Ifi on the other hand, that portion of the organ have been ruptured which is uncovered by the perito- neum, the mine may infiltrate into the areolar tissue betAveen this membrane and the abdominal waU, and, diffusing itself widely, produce destructiA’e sloughing of the tissues amongst which it spreads. In these cases life may be prolonged for some days, when the patient commonly sinks from the imtation and inflammation combined. An open Avoimd of the bladder is by no means so dangerous as a subcutaneous ruptiue. Many patients have recovered Avhose- fladders haAn been perforated and traA'ersed by bullets, the urine finding a free- exit through the apertmes, and consequently not tending to extravasate itself, mthrie relates several cases of this kind ; and Thomson saAv fourteen cases a er the battle of Waterloo, in a fair way of recovery. Thus, although we accident as of tho gravest character, yet it cannot be Lonsicloicd as being necessarily fatal.U\JUliIES OF THE AJW02IEN AND PELVIS. The situation of tlic injury in tlie hypogastric region, thcsuper- AGution ot collapse tollowccl by intense burning pain in the abdomen and pelvis, with inability to pass the urine, or, if any have escaped from the urethra. Its being tinged ivith blood, are usually sufficient to point to the natm-e of the accident. If, m addition, it be found on introducing a catheter that the bladder is contracted and empty, or that but a small cpiantity of bloody urine escapes, the Surgeon may be sure that this organ has been bui-st. In the case of gun-shot injury, the escape of m-ine which generally takes place through the track of the bullet iviU afford incontestable evidence of the mischief tluit has been produced. AVhen the bladder is ruptiu-ed through that portion which is covered by peritoneum, the urine escapes into the pelvic cavity ; there, however, it does not diffuse itself, but remains hke a feculent extravasation in the neighbom’- hood of the apertine of escape, restrained by the general pressure of the ■abdominal and pelvic viscera. This localized extra-vesical extravasation may be emptied by the catheter thimigh the rent in the bladder, hence the escape of urine is not incompatible mth ruptiue of the bladder. This important jiractical point is well illustrated by the following case. A man was admitted into the hosjiital under my care, who had sustained ruptiue of the upper and j30sterior wall of the bladder by falhng down staus ; Avhen admitted he was profoundly collajDsed and semi-unconscious. The abdomen was swollen, tender, tympanitic in fient, dull in the flanks. On passing a catheter the bladder was found to be empty and contracted, but with a little gentle manipulation the point of the instrument could be passed thieugh the laceration in the posterior wall of the bladder, and a large quantity of clear urine was drawn off'. For two days the patient seemed to be doing well. The catheter was taken out to be cleaned, coidd not be introduced afterwards, little mine escaped, and the patient died of peritonitis. In the Treatment, the most important indication is the prevention of fiuther extravasation by the introduction of a fidl-sized elastic catheter into the bladder. This must be tied in, and should be left open, vith a vulcanised India-rubber tube attached, so that the mine may dribble away through it as fast as it accimiulates. Opium should be given, as in aU severe abdominal iujiuies, to prevent peristaltic action, and to prevent the diffusion of the mine thi’ough the abdominal cavity. If the rupture has taken place in a part of the bladder uncovered by peritoneum the danger is from minary infiltration. If •any sign of extravasation appear externally, free and deep incisions should be made into the part, so as to facihtate the early escape of the effused fluid and the putrid sloughs. I cannot but consider all active anti-phlogistic treatment •as out of place in these injmies, never having seen the shghtest benefit follow its employmeirt. The only chance that the patient has, if once extensive extravasation have occurred, is that there may be sufficient power left in the constitution to throw out a barrier of lymph that will limit the diffuse and sloughing inflammatory action set up ; and the prospect of this would certainly not be increased by the employment of depletory measures. There will also be so great a call iqDon the jiowers of the system at a later i^eriod, after slough- ing has fairly set in, that a supjDorting or even stimulating plan ot treatment will rather be required.WOUNDS OF THE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 651 Foreign Bodies, such as pieces of catheters, tobacco-pipes, pencils, &c., are occasionally met with in the male urinary organs, having been introduced through the urethra. In some cases they arc soon spontaneously expelled. If left ill the bladder they become iucrusted with phosphates, and thus become the nuclei often of large and iiTegularly shaped calculi ; hence it is absolutely necessary to remove them speedily. This may occasionally be done oy fortunately seizing the foreign body mth a small lithotrite or urethral forceps at one end, and withdrawing it in the direction of its long axis. But if this procediu'e be unsuccessful, it must be cut out. This is more safely done by the median than by the lateral operation of cystotomy. Bullets, pieces of clothing, &c, are occasionally lodged in the bladder in gun- shot wounds of that organ. These speedily become incrusted with urinary deposits, and, giving rise to the symptoms of stone in the bladder, require to be removed by cystotomy, an operation that has piroved very successfid in these cases, e’^'idently in consequence of. the healthy condition of the mlnary organs. Dixon has collected from various works the details of fifteen cases, in which balls, that had either primarily entered the bladder, or had foimd their way into this organ by abscess or ulceration after having been lodged in the neighboiu’hood, were extracted by operation. In ten of these cases the result was successful; in the remaining five no record is made of the tennination. AiTow-heads have also been met with in the bladder. There is, in the Ai’my Medical Museum at Washington, a remarkable sp>ecimen of an Indian arrow- head which has formed the nucleus of a large phosphatic calculus. In the female also, various foreign bodies are occasionally passed uj) the urethra, and shpping from the fingers are lost in the bladder.' Hair-pins, bougies, pencils, pen-holders, and a vast variety of similar objects have here been met with. They may usually easily be extracted tlorough the urethra, which should be expanded by a proper dilator. Ruptuhb op the Ureter.—Stanley has related a remarkable case in n 1C the Ureter was ruptui’ed by external violence, and in which the patient recovered ; a very large accumulation of fiuid forming on the injured side of the abdomen, with considerable circumscribed tiunefaction and fluctuation, and u hich required repeated tajiping. In another case, in which the Pelvis of ^ ® nipitured, a similar collection of urine took place within the u c omen, requiring tapping ; as much as six pints being removed at one SI ing.^ On examination after death, Avhich occiuTed in the tenth week fr-om e acci ent, a large cyst was found behind the peritoneum, communicatino- u-ith the pehus of the kidney.

The hajinoi’rhage is usually Ti'cry profuse. If it proceed from a distinct arterial trunk, such as the dorsal artery or that of a corpus caTernosnm, the vessel must be ligatured. If it occur from general oozing fr-om the vascular tissues of the penis, it may be arrested by cold, pressure, or astringents. Pressure is best applied by passing a large catheter into the bladder, and then compressing the organ against this by means of a narrow bandage or circular strip of plaster. Injury of the genital organs by self-mutilation in cases of sexual mania or melancholia is occasionally met with. In some cases the patient has cut ofi‘ one testis; in others, the penis; in others, again, the Avhole of the external sexual organs. Injuries such as these present no very special character, and require to be treated on ordinary principles, the great point being of course to restrain the haemorrhage and to prevent contraction of the urethral orifice. Urethra.—Woimds of the Urethra by gun-shot injiny, or sharp instru- ments, is a troublesome accident, on account of the liability to the infiltration of urine and ultimately to fistula. It may be recognised by the escape of blood from the meatus, and of mine from the Avound. The Treatment consists in the introduction of a gum catheter, which should be tied in ; and if the edges of the wound be clean cut, they may be brought together by inter- rupted sutures. Laceration of the Urethra is immediately attended by most serious symptoms, and remotely followed by most disastrous consequences. It A'ery frequently occurs in men employed in building, from slipping in Avalkiug across an unfinished floor, in such a Avay as to fall heaUly astride upon one of the joists, thus bruising the perineum and rupturing the urethra and other struc- times lying under the rami and symphysis of the os pubis. The same accident may arise in other Avays. Thus I haA’e met Avith it in a farrier, kicked in the perincerrm whilst shoeing a horse ; and it has been met with as a consequence of laceration by a splinter of bone from a fr'acture of the ramus of the os pubis. In these injuries the integrrments are usually untorn, but deeply ecchymosed. The extravasation of blood is often considerable, extending into the scrotum, Avhich rapidly swells up and becomes black. It may, indeed, be very serioi^ arising in some cases from the lacerated structiu’es and the torn superficial or transverse arteries of the perinaeiun; in other instances from the corpus spongiosimr, the brrlb, or the artery of the bulb. In all cases of lacerated urethra, blood will drip from the orifice; and, if the bulb and its arteries have been torn, the haemon-hage fr'om these may be very great, a pint or more of blood being thus rapidly lost, in addition to great accimiulations in the perimEiun and scrotum, distending these parts with coagula and infiltration. , In consequence of the intemiption in the continuity of the canal and tlic compression or plugging of the torn part by the coagida of the extravasatod blood, the urine cannot be voided and the bladder gradually fi s. 'CTREATMENT OF LACERATED URETHRA. 653 patient attempt to empty it, only a few drops will issue from the urethral orifice ; but he will be seized with severe burnino-, smarting pain in the perinmum, and the ultimate CA'ils of the injury will he greatly aggi’avated, for, wherever the urine penetrates, sloughing of areolar tissue will invariably and rapidly ensue. There is this great difference between extravasation of urine from ruptured bladder and fr-om lacerated urethra : in the first case the urine escapes involuntarily fr-om the injured organ ; in the second instance, no lu'ine Avill escape from the torn lu-ethra, unless by a voluntary expulsive effort on the part of the patient. The sufferings of the patient speedily become aggravated by the retention of the urine and the distress occasioned by the distension of the bladder ; and the necessity for relief thus becomes urgent, lest by an involuntary spasmodic effort the urine be pumped -widely into the already broken down areolar tissue of the perinmum and scrotum. The ultimate results of a lacerated urethra are no less serious than the immediate effects. If the floor only of the urethra have been lacerated, lea-vrng the upper part of the wall of the canal intact, the continuity of the m-ethra -will not be lost, but a permanent traumatic stricture of the worst kind ^viiI ensue. If the m-ethra have been completely torn across, or slough as a result of the injiu-y, obliteration of a portion of the canal may take place, and an incurable urinary fistula -\riU be left in the perinmum. The Treatment consists in the early introduction of a catheter into the bladder. If this caii be done before the patient has made an attempt to pass his urine, much of the immediate danger of the case may be averted, by the prevention of urinary infiltration. The catheter, which shordd be an elastic one, must be left in the bladder for a few days. It should not be plugged, but should have a vulcanised India-rubber tube attached, so that the mine may escape as fast as secreted. If any hardness, throbbing, or other sign of in-itation occur in the perinmum, free incision should be made into the part, so as to afford a ready outlet for any urine that may have been effused. If the Siu-geon find it impossible to introduce a catheter into the bladder, the m-ethra being torn completely across, he should pass it as fiir as it will go, and then, putting- the patient in the position for hthotomy, make a free incision in the mesial line upon the j)oint of the instrument, so as to make an ojDeniug in the perinmmn that vill communicate with the deeper portion of the urethra ; any arteries that bleed fr-eely should be tied. He must then endeavour to loass T /-V r-t k 1-1 .-V ^ -.1^ 1 .m iT T.i . — urethra. This is often extremely difficult. If the floor of the urethra only ave been torn, it may be accomplished by keeping- the point of the catheter well against the upper wall of the canal; but if the urethra have been completely torn across, it will tax all the skill of the Surgeon to direct and pass the instrument into the vesical end of the canal. An ingenious plan for overeoraing the_ difficulty in such cases was suggested by T. P. Teale (senior) 0 heeds. A director is fii-st introrhic.nd fnf'n flip -nTnYiinoi _• the catheter into the bladder, through the proximal portion of the injured654 INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND BELYIS. torn across a catheter cannot he passed, and the nrine finds a difficulty in escaping, relief not being afforded by the perimeal incision, and the bladder becoming overdistended, this organ should be tapped through the rectum, in the way that will be described when we come to speak of diseases of the nriiiary organs. ^ But tai^ping through the rectum should not be done before the perinasal incision is made. VAC4INA AND Rectum.—Foreign Bodies are occasionally thnist forcibly into or impacted in the vagina or rectum. When a foreign body, such as a stick, or a broom-handle, or the leg of a chair, is thrust forcibly up the rectum by a person falling on such a body, two dangers may result; either extensive laceration of the sphincter ani and the perinEeum, with hiemorrhage ; or trans- fixion of the'gut and wound of the peritoneum, with consecutive inflammation of that membrane. The consequences of such an injury present nothing veiy special, and require to be treated on ordinaiy principles. If in the fall the foreign body have been forcibly thrust into the vagina, there ivill be danger of injury to the bladder or peritoneum ; but the chief danger will result from laceration of the labium, and free htemorrhage fr-om this source. I have several times seen enormous quantities of blood thus lost. This htemon-hage is best an-ested by plugging firmly with lint soaked in a solution of the percliloride of iron, and by the pressiu'e of a bandage. A variety of things, such as pieces of stick, glass-bottles, gallipots, tumblers, &c., have been introduced and impacted in these canals. Their extraction is often very difficult, in consequence of the swelhug of the mucous membrane over and around them, and the depth to which they have been pushed. In order to remove them, the use of hthotomy or necrosis forceps may be required. In some cases the foreign body produces ulceration into the bladder ; and it has been found to transfix the wall of the canal in which it is lodged, and, by penetrating the peritoneum, has speedily occasioned death. A remarkable case of this kind occiUTed in my practice, in which a cedar pencil, five inches long, and cut to a point, had been forced up by the patient herself, a young woman, through the posterior wall of the vagina into the abdominal caA'ity. Here it transfixed two coils of the small intestine, and after being fixed there for eight months, I extracted it by an incision through the anterior abdominal wall, midway between the umbilicus and Poupart’s ligament, where its point was engaged in the fascia transversahs. It had occasioned repeated attacks of peritonitis ; and, after extraction, death resulted from that cause. Laceration oe the Peeinhdum.—The perinteiun is occasionally ruptured during parturition. The extent of the laceration varies groatly, and influences materially the ultimate issue of the case. In some cases there is merely a shght rent at the fourchette ; in others, the whole perinteum has given way as far as the sphincter ani ; in a third case the sphincter is also torn ; and in a fom-th the rent has extended into the recto-vaginal septum. The woi*st cases are those in which the periineum has been torn, and the recto-vaginal septum destroyed by sloughing from prolonged impaction of the foetal head. In such cases, the loss of soft tissues and the existence of dense cicatricial bands render complete union by operation very uncertain. The length of time that has elapsed since the occurrence of the injury is of little consequence. It is as easy to repair a perimeum that has been lacerated655 OPERATION FOR RECTO-VAGINAL RUPTURE. for ten yeare, as for ten days. A very serious evil arising from ruptured I)erimeum is the loss of support to the pehic viscera, and the consequent liability to prolapsus of the uterus or of the A'aginal or vesical Avail. When the sphincter ani or the recto-vaginal septimi has giA'en Avay, incontinence of fteces to a greater or lesser e.xtent is the consequence, feculent matter coming aAvay in a fluid state iuA'oluntarily. The neighbouring parts are from this cause liable to excoriation ; and not unfrequently the rectal mucous membrane becomes pro- lapsed or htemon-hoidal. The Trealment, Avhich is purely operative, consists, in chronic cases, of a plastic in-ocedure, haAing for its object the bringing together and the union by adhesion of the opposite sides of the rent. The extent and difficulty of this operation aaiII vary according to the extent of the laceration, and its prospect of success AAill depend on attention to several points in its performance ; but also, as is the case Avith most plastic j)rocedures, on the state of the patient’s health. This should bo brought up to the best possible condition before the Surgeon proceeds to operate. All local iiTitation should be removed, piles or pro- lapsus ani cmed, and the parts brought into as healthy a state as possible. When the laceration is of very limited extent and recent, union may usually be effected by the immediate introduction of a point or tAA^o of suture, and bringing and keeping the thighs together. Should the laceration, though it iiiA-olves the Avhole perinaaum, be confined to this, and not extend into the sphincter ani, it may usually readily be repaired by paring the edges freely, and passing tAvo deep quilled and foim superficial sutimes, so as to bring the oj)posite sides together, as Avill immediately be described. After the operation, the patient should he on her side, and either have the urine draAvn off three times a day, or A\ear an elastic catheter for at least a Aveek. In these cases the boAvels may be ahoAved to act naturally, care being taken that the motions be kept aAvay from the perinseum, Avhich must be supported by the nurse when the bowels act. When the laceration is very extensive, extending through the perinteum, the sphincter ani, and the posterior wall of the vagina into the rectum—in fact, tearing through the recto-vaginal septum—more extensive and most careful treatment Avill be required. The foUoAving is the mode of performino- the necessary operation. ® Operation for Rupture of the Perinaeum involving the Recto-Vaginal Septum.—The bowels haA'ing been well cleared out, the patient should be placed m the position for lithotomy. The upper wall of the vagina being held ou 0 the AA^ay by means of a “duck-billed” speculum, the edges and sides of 0 rent must be freely and deeifiy pared in a horse-shoe shape, so as to leave a laAv surface about an inch in Avidth. The greatest care must be taken to remove every particle of mucous membrane and integumcntal structure not wi y fiom the sides of the fissure, but also fr'om above the upper ano-Ie of it in the recto-vaginal septum, and from the anterior part of this. Any nortioii 0 icse structures that may be left behind, however minute, Avill, of course be . 0 )s aclc to union, and Avill either interfere completely AAuth it, or leave a fm opening in its site. The sphincter ani should then be freely divided cac side of the coccyx, as recommended by BroAAm, in order that its artimi may be parelyecd, and all tesioa of the part aenaoved , 0 “s656 INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. muscles around the anus may be loosened by subcutaneous section oi‘ tlieir <!0ccygcal attacbments. Three quilled sutures (Fig. 2G2) should tlien bo passed deeply tin ough the freshened side ot the laceration, and the edges brought together by a few superfine inter- rupted sutures, or ]jy a continuous suture. The deep sutures are best introduced by long na'jvus-needles. The one nearest the anus should be passed first; and if the recto-vaginal septum be involved in the rent, it must be dipped into but not passed through the freshened surface of tins part, so as to dravp it well forwards and against the new perimeum. The sutures should be introduced at a distance of one inch from the cut •edge, should pass about three-quarters of an inch in depth, and be brought out on the other side at the same distance from the freshened surfaces as that at which they entered. The great difficulty in this operation will be found to ■consist in the enlargement of the aperture in the recto-vaginal septum, and in bringing its edges together. In proportion to the loss of substance that has ocemred, this difficulty will increase. Sometimes a narrow band, the result of «ome previous ineffectual attempt at union, wiU be found to stretch across the gap nt the verge of the anus. This should not be retained, as it will be gveatly in the way of the operator, and useless as far as after-union is concerned. The best material for the deep sutines is strong whip-cord well waxed, or iron vdre. I now generally j)refer the wire as less irritating. For the super- ficial sutui’es, thin annealed silver wire should be applied in the continuous mamier by means of the glover’s stitch ; the parts are thus much more secm-ely ■and easily held together than by the interrupted suture. The siiccess of the operation will, to a great extent, depend on the attention bestoAved on the after-treatment, the mode of conducting which has been laid doAvn with much precision by B. Brown. The principal points to be attended to are as follows. Immediately after the operation, a full dose of opium should be o-iven, followed by a grain once or tAAUce a day, so as to arrest all intestinal action. The patient should be laid on her side, and a catheter, furnished with a long India-rubber tube introduced, retained so as to prevent any di'ibbliiig of mine OAcr the raw edges, which would be fatal to their union. Ihe hae- morrhage usually ceases when the edges are brought together. If it should continue, the application of a pad and T-bandage, and of ice in the vagina, will generally easily control it. The deep sutmes, if of Avhip-cord, should be left m for three days, as a general rule. In some cases they may even be retained for foin- days ; but if any suppmation be set up along their track, they must at once be AvithdraAAOi ; if of wire, fhey may be left longer—for six days. I lie superficial sutures should be left in as long as they produce no irritation ; avhen of silver wire, they may be left undisturbed for eight or ten days. _ Diiriiio^this period, I have found it advantageous to keep the part covered with collodion, men the sutures are removed, a pad of diy lint, supported by a l-bamlage.

"When the recto-vaginal septum has been implicated, the bowels should not be allowed to act for at least ten or twelve days, lest the freshly united surfaces be torn through. When the perina3um only has been the seat of laceration, they maj be allowed to act earlier. Diming the whole of the treatment, the patient’s strength must be supported by abundant nourish- ment, and scrupulous attention paid to the cleanliness of the parts, which should be frequently syringed vdth carbolised water and covered with finely carded dry wool. Plastic operations of this kind should not be performed unless the patient be in a good state of health, that there may be a good prospect of immediate union. The success of the case will at last mainly depend on the extent of laceration, or rather of loss of substance, in the recto-vaginal septum. If this be uninjured, or merely notched as it were, there will be but little difficulty experienced in effecting a cure. If, on the other hand, this wall be deeply lacerated, or, still worse, if a portion of it have sloughed away, the greatest difficulty may result in effecting union ; and in such untowai’d circumstances it may happen, that the perimeum unites, but that a fistulous opening is still left in the recto-vaginal wall, requiring a futime plastic operation for its closure {vide Chapter LXVII.). VOL. I. u uDIVISION THIRD. SUKGICAL DISEASES. DISEASES AFFECTING THE TISSUES GENERALLY. CHAPTEK XXX. MOETIFICATION, OR GANGRENE. The death of a part of the body only is, in sui’gical language, termed IVEortification or Gangrene. When the morbid action is confined to the osseous structm-es or to the cartilages, it is termed Necrosis; when hmited to the soft tissues of a hmh. Sphacelation; and when accompanied by ulcera- tion, it is called Sloughing. Many other varieties of gangrene are recognised by Surgeons. Like aU other diseases, it may be Acute or Chronic in its duration ; as the parts affected are moist and swollen, or dry and shrivelled, it may be divided into the Moist and the Dry or Mummified gangrene ; so again, according to its cause, it is spoken of as Idiopathic or Traumatic; and very frequently, and most correctly perhaps, it is aivanged under the denominations of Constitutional and Local. Besides these, various Specific forms of the disease are met Avith, which Avill require special consideration. Local Signs.—^Whatever form the gangrene may assume, certain local phenomena are common to all varieties. The part becomes colder than natural; not only is it colder than the corresponding part on the opposite side of the body, but the temperatime may fall below that of the external air. The sensi- bihty of the part is lost. It may be touched, pricked, or cut without feeling. In some cases the sensibihty is greatly increased just before gangrene sets in, intense agonising pain of a burning or neuralgic character being experienced, Avhich soon gives way to complete insensibihty. All motion of the part itself ceases. It may be moved by muscles from a distance, as a mortified toe might be moved by the unaffected flexors or extensors, but it has no power of motion independently of that which is communicated fi'om a distance. The skin of the mortified part becomes discoloiued, usnally gi-cyish or greenish, the cuticle separates, and when pressed upon obliquely slides away imder the fiugei, leaving the moist and slippery cutis exposed. The colour gradually darkens to a dull purplish greenish black, mottled in patches with I’eddish-biown spots,CAUSES OF MOItTIFICATlOK 659 and after a time there is an odour of putrescence evolved, vciy commonly with an emphysematous crackling from effusion of gas into the tissues of the part. The colour of the part affected is usually of a dark pm-plish or greenish black, more or less mottled with red. This, which is unlike anything else in the system, shows that putrefactive changes have taken place in the solids and fluids of the diseased tissues, and is usually connected Avith the moist and SAvollen form of the disease. Tn the dry variety of gangi’cne the colour is often at first of a pale tallowy-white, with a mottled appearance upon the surface. The skin soon sln-iA'els, becomes diy, horny, and semi-transparent, and even- tually assumes a broAvm wrinkled appearance ; in other cases the gangTenous part is broAvn, dry, and shrivelled from the very first. These differences in the colour of the mortified part indicate con-esponding differences in the cause of the affection. In general terms, it may be stated that the dark varieties of gangi-eue are the result of destructive changes taking place in the very part itseh; or ai-e of constitutional origin; whilst the pale form of the affection ■occurs as a consequence of some obstruction to the supply of blood to the part, and is a loeal disease, influencing the constitution secondarily. But it must be borne in mind that gangvene may occiu’, that is to say, that the part may lose its A’itahty, without becoming dark, foetid, or emphysematous. These signs, though sometimes eontemporaneous with loss of vitahty, are more frequently ■consecutive to it, and indicate more than the simple' death of the part; they are proofs of putrescence havmg set in, as well as of death having occurred. Constitutional Symptoms.—These vary greatly. When the disease is stiictly local, affecting a part of but hmited extent, and perhaps of no great importance to the economy, they are not very strongly marked. If, however, the gangi-ene, although hmited, implicate important organs, as a knuckle of intestine for example, marked symptoms declare themselves. Whatever the precursory condition may be, the frill invasion of the gangrene, if it be rapid, IS always aceompanied by eonstitutional distiu’bance of an asthenic type, attended by gi-eat depression of the powers of the system, with a dull and •anxious countenance, and a feeble, quick, and easily compressible pulse ; the tongue IS brovm, and soon becomes loaded ivith sordes. When the gangrene is internal, sudden cessation of pain, with hiccup, vomiting, and tympanitic dis- tension of the abdomen, may be superadded to the symptoms, and indicate the mischief that has ocemTed. Death usually supervenes with low delirium twitchings, and epma. men the invasion of the gangrene is more gradual’ as in some of the constitutional forms affecting the lower extremities, the aSheSorT ^ m-itative fever, eventually subsiding into the “'I- Rive immediately on the part, SodZl ^1, T" -i”;™ Tims, gangi-ene of a part may hi hcfi-nr Mtahty of its tissues is destroyed by severe contusion or ^ ^ heat r H operatfoe oi by eaWfi 1 , or Dy calcification or embolism of the arteries. surgical u u 2MORTIFICATION, OR GANGRENE. 66o ?>. Cbstruction of the Circulation tliroxigh or Retardation in the return of Venous Blood from a part may cause gangrene. Under this head are to he classed those forms o!‘ gangrene ■which arise Ifom inflammation, and those in -which the return of blood through the principal veins is interlhred ■\vith by thrombosis, or by pressure on the venous tract. 4. Specific Poisons of various kinds occasion special diseases of which gangrene is the principal characteristic. Thus, hospital gangrene, malignant pustule, glanders, cancrum oris, carbuncle, and ergotism, are instances of specific affections accompanied by gangrenous action. Amongst the causes, some are Constitutional, others Local, in their action. Those forms of gangrene are said to be constitutional which arise from intense or specific inflammation of the part; from obstruction of the circulation in consequence of disease of the heart and vessels ; or from the action of various specific poisons. On the other hand, those varieties of gangrene are local which arise from injuries of all kinds, whether applied to the part itself, or to the main artery leading to it, by its ligature or woimd, or from the plugging of the vessels which commimicate ■with ulcers or other’ circumscribed inflammation. These forms of gangrene which arise from traumatic causes, have been already described in previous chapters (see pp. 208,254,263, 310) ; while those that arise from obstructed circulation to or through a part, or that take the form of specific disease, are left for consideration here. Gangrene from Arrest oe the Supply op Arterial Blood.—Whenever a part of the body is deprived of its proper supply of blood, mortification may ensue. Most commonly, when the principal trunk of an artery is obstructed, the collateral circulation is sufficient to maintain the vitality of the part; but, should this be interfered -with, gangTene occiu’S from the simple deprivation of blood. Indeed, the sudden loss of a large quantity of blood from the system generally may occasion the death of some of the extreme parts of the body, in which the circulation is natiu’ally most languid. Thus Sir B. Brodie relates the case of a drunken man, who, being bled to an inordinate extent, was seized with gangrene of both feet. The want of a due supply of arterial blood to the limb may be occasioned by two primary sets of causes :—a, from injury or ojoeredion, as wound or ligature of the main trimk; I, from disease, as hj thrombosis or by embolism; by calcificcdion, and suhsequent occlusion of the vessel. ^ Gangrene from arterial obstruction varies materially in its symptoms, prognosis, and treatment, accord- ino- as it arises fr’om one or other of these causes. Nhen the obstruction is seated in the arteries alone, the gangvene wiU be of the dry kind ; but when there is also an impediment to the return of blood through the veins, the disease will partake more or less of the character of the moist variety. a. A hmb gangrenous in consequence of the Ligature or Wound of its Main Artery, without any other injury to the vascular system, becomes cold, feels heavy, and loses its sensibility; at the same time it assmnes a dull ta 0A7- i,Mte colOTir, mottted with greyish or brownish streaks. This state of tbm^ is chiefly met with in the lower extremity ; the integimieiits of the loot die, becoming semi-transparent and horny-looking where they are streWied over the tendons of the instep, and the part presents a shrivelled appeainnee. It » short time the pallid colour is lost, the part becoming brown or blackish, ibisGANGREXE FROJil THROMBOSIS AXE EMBOLISM. 66i form of gangi-cue may im-aclc the whole of the loAver limb, but most commonly is limited to'’the foot, stopping either just above the ankle, or if not there, im- mediately below the knee, as Guthrie has observed ; the, arrest taking place in one or other of these two spots, on aceouut of the greater freedom of the col- lateral circulation here than in other parts of the limb. If any of the large venoils trunks become obstructed or otherwise implicated, so that the return of blood through them is interfered with at the same time that the supply by the arteries is aiTested, the limb generally assumes a greenish-blue colour, and rapidly runs into putrefaction. In some of these cases it happens that sloughs of the integument and subcutaneous areolar tissue form, although the limb generally preserves its 'natality. The treatment of these forms of gangvene, which are strictly local, is described in the chapter on the Arrest of Arterial HtemoiThage. &. Gangi-ene may oecur from the arrest of the circulation through an artery as the result of Disease or Alteration in the Coats of the Vessel, or from some Morbid State of the Blood. This is the variety that is commonly called Sponfaneous. It may be the result of thrombosis or embolism in a previously healthy ai’tery, or of the plugging up of an artery that has imdergone athero- matous change, or calcification, or other senile degeneration. Spontaneous gaugreiie from the formation of Thrombosis, or clot in an artery, usually occins in young or middle-aged persons. Whether the throm- bosis be the result of, or the antecedent to, inflammation within the vessel, is a cjuestion which need not be discussed here. In either case, when gaugrene fr-om this cause appears, Ave meet with the usual signs of arteritis, such as tenderness along the coinse of the vessel, cessation of pulsation in its terminal branches, and intense superficial pain in the limb, followed by the rapid super- A-ention of dark dry gangrene in the Avhole of the extremity up to the point at AA^hich the vessel is inflamed. In some cases the gangrene partakes of the characters of the humid form, oAving to the implication of the contiguous vems. It is, I believe, most frequently met Avith in the upper extremities j at least, most of the instances of it that I hav'e seen have been situated there. I haA'e obserA'ed it most commonly in Avomen, occurring sometimes at an early period of life, eA'en at the eighteenth year. Its causes are A'ery obscine ; in some cases the disease appears to bo of rheumatic origin, in others it is connected AAith a cachectic and broken state of constitution. It frequently proves fatal by the suj)crAention of ty[Ahoid symptoms, before any attempt can be made by nature to separate the mortified part. After death, the affected vessel is found fii'inly plugged at the seat of obstruction by a dense coagulum, Avhich completely impedes the circulation through it. (gangrene may also be produced by Embolism, the terminal branches of the arteries and the capillary vessels becoming plugged by a mass of finely gTanular fibrinous matter, Avhich is can-ied aAAny by the blood-cinrent from the heart, or IS Avashed doAvir and into the loAver part of the A-essel from the inflamed patch on the inner smfaee of the artery at a higher point. In peculiar conditions of >e flood, at present of an uncertain character, this plugging is more specially fip 0 occur. Ill some cases the embolou appears to consist of a pluo- of which has been detached from a distant part ol the circulatory ‘ 1 fr ‘ ., from the Ulterior of the left ventricle for instance, and, being carried662 MOBTIFIGATION, OR GANGRENE. by the circulation into the arterial system, stops at some point of bifm’cation or of narrowing ot a vessel. In such cases the gangrene may develop itself suddenly. The aecompanying drawing (Fig. represents the bifiu’cation ot the common femoral artery occupied by a fibrinous plug, taken from a man aged ?,2, who died of gan- grene of the left leg. In this case the patient, after recovering from rheumatic endocarditis, whilst straining at stool, suddenly felt his left leg tingle painfully, then become numb and cold. The circulation in it ceased, and gangrene speedily supervened, which extended as liigh as the knee. Death followed amputa- tion of the limb. Here there can be little doubt that the sudden supervention of gangrene was the result of obstruction to the obstiuR- arterial circulation of the lower extremity, consecpient on the Arteiy detachment of a fibrinous endocardial plug, and its aiTest at Emboion bifurcation of the femoral artery. Spontaireous gangrene is termed Senile when it occiu’S in old people in consequence of the Coats of the Arteries becoming Rigid and Calcified (Fig. 2G4), and unable to maintain the proper circulation of blood through the limb. The want of a due supply of arterial blood in these cases is not only owing to the diseased state of the arteries, but is in a gveat measure due to the feeble propulsive power of the heart, and the consequent naturally weakened circulation through the lower limbs especially. When the circula- tion is so enfeebled as to lower the nutrition of the limb, coldness, cramps, and in some cases cutaneous ulcerations, will ensue. When the circulation becomes arrested from the conjoined influences of diminished cardiac propulsive power and arterial obstruction, gangnene inevitably results. It is met with in the lower extremities of people past the middle period of life, and the tendency to it increases as age advances. The premonitory symptoms are as follow. A sensation of Aveight in the limb, Avith coldness, itching, and tingling in the feet, and cramps in the calves, is complained of, and the circulation of the part is habitually defective, the pulsation of the tibials being scarcely per- ceptible. This condition commonly exists for a considerable length of time before gangrene actually comes on, and should always be looked upon Avith anxiety in old people. In many instances the disease sets in AAuthout any exciting cause ; but in other cases the mortification is immediately developed, as the result of some slight inflammation accidentally induced, as from the excoriation produced by a tight boot, or from a trivial wound in cutting a com or toe-nail; the inflammation occasioned by this slight injiuy being sufficient to disturb the balance of the circulation in the already weakened part to so great an extent, that gangi’ene ensues. In other instances, again, the disease is ushered in by more acute symptoms. The whole foot becomes swollen, oedematous, and red ; inflammation, apparently of a gouty character, being set up in it. In whatever way it begins, the gangrene may at first only affect one toe, or it may from the commencement inAmlve several toes. It most g-encrally in the fii’st instance appears in the form of a cold purple or blackish-icd spot on the side of one of the toes, usually the inner side of the great toe , this spot may be sruTOunded by an inflamed areola, and accompanied by much smarting and birrning pain of a paroxysmal character ; it spreads by grac rra yGANGRENE FROM VENOUS OBSTRUCTION. 663 involving the inflamed areola, which continues to extend in proportion as the gangi-ene progi-esses. The pain, which is often of the most intense character, subsides when the gangrene becomes complete. In other cases the toes and foot simply shrivel, without any sign of local in- flammation and udth but little constitutional disturbance. In one or other of these ways the affection gradually creeps up the limb, invading perhaps one toe after another, involving the instep (Fig. 205), the heel, or the sole of the foot; and unless it terminate by the formation of the line of demarcation, or death put an end to the patient’s sufferings, it may extend up the ankle or leg. The part that is destroyed is always black, dry, and shrivelled, resembling closely in appearance a dried muuuny; hence the change is often termed Mummification (Fig. :206). The toes often look like the shilveiled skins of over-ripe or sucked-out black guapes. There is usually consider- able constitutional distimbance, sometimes pyrexial at first, but subsequently sinking into an irritative or asthenic form ; and the disease is often .fatal in from a month to six weeks. But this is very uncertain. I have knovm the disease to continue with -s-eiy little constitutional distiu’bance for more than twelve months, slowly creeping on during that time. In other instances, the gangrene being limited to a small extent, as to the toes only, the patient may recover with the loss of the fore part of the foot. The pathology of the arterial system, in re- ference to these forms of gangrene, will be more fuUy discussed in the first chapter of Volume II. Gaxgrene prom Obstruction op the Circulation THROUGH OR PROM A Part.—This may occui' in three ways : 1, by Venous Oistruct'ion, and consequent over-accumulation of blood ; 2, by the arrest of all the blood, arterial, venous, and capillary, as in Strancjulcdion by Pig. 26I.—Arteries a tight ligatiu’e ; 3, by Inflammation. wity°Xsteuftea 1. Venous Obstruction.—Gangrene mav ™ arise from obstruction to the return of blood through the veins of a part, the circulation being arrested by the overloading of the capillaries ivith venous blood. It is especially apt to take place if the arterial supply be diminished at the same time that the retimi of venous blood is interfered ivitli : as when an artery and vein ai-e compressed, or when the femoral vein is wounded accidentally at the time ^— ■- i- , „ j Pig. 265. — Senile Oniigi-cne: Ex- liosure of Bones of Foot. this cause IS when the artery is ligatimed.

MORTIFICATION, OR GANGRENE. extremities that are met with Ihom pure debility, as after fevers, ol'ten appear to originate in this way. i. Strangulation.—A part is often pm-posely strangled by a Surgeon in operative procedures ; or its circulation may in this way be arrested as the result of certain accidents or diseased conditions. (See p. 187.) In cither case, the strangulation acts by stopping more or less completely the whole of the circulation through the part. If the strangulation be sufficiently severe, it may kill the tissues outright : for instance, when a naivus or a pile is tied, all flow of blood to or from the part is suddenly arrested, and its vitality is destroyed, the tissues that ha-s'e been strangled shrivelling and separating by ulceration along the line of ligatiu’c. When the strangulation is not so severe as this, great congestion ensues, consequent on the amomit of blood sent into the part being greater than can be removed by the veins, which are more affected by the constricting force than the arteries ; the part strangled becomes dark and congested, phlyctenae or vesicles arise on its sm’face, and effusion takes place into its tissue ; inflammation becomes at last superadded to the effects of the strangulation, and still more embarrasses the circulation of the part: and thus sloughing arises, from the conjoined action of the strangula- tion and the inflammatory exudation. AU this we find in the constricted gut of a strangulated hernia. 3. Inflammation.—Deferring for the present the consideration of certain specific forms of inflammatory disease that are Hable to be attended with gangrene, we have here to consider the death of parts, when it ocem’s as a sequence of ordinary inflammation. The production of gangvene by inflam- mation,—or rather, perhaps, by the congestion formmg part of it—is a less simple affair than its production in either of the ways which we have ah-eady described. Sir James Paget remarks that in certain forms of gangrene after inflammation, all the more simple ordinary causes of mortification may be involved along with others ; thus, “ 1. The inflammatory congestion may end in stagnation of the blood; and this, as an indirect cause of mortification, may lead to the death of the blood and that of the tissues which require hmug circulating blood for their support. 2. A degeneration of the proper textmes is a constant part of the inflammatory process ; and this degeneration may itself proceed to death, while it is concurrent with defects in the conditions of nutrition. 3. The exudation of fluid in some inflamed parts may so compress, and by the swelling so elongate the blood-vessels, as to diminish materially the influx of fi’esh blood, even when little of that affeady in the part is stagnant.” The intensity of the inflammation may be so great as to kill the part directly, however healthy its texture or soimd the constitution of the patient may be. More commonly, however, it is not so much the actual as the relatn e intensity of the inflammation that destroys the part: there being some debdity, local or constitutional, by which the resisting or preservative power is lessened. Paget says that the gangrene here seems to arise especially in persons nhose tissues have become degenerate in consequence of old age, of defective lood or of other materials of life, or through habitual intemperance ; the distui ance of local nutrition, which forms part of the inflammatory process, oreater than the enfeebled tissues can resist or overcome. It is remarkable DARREST OF GANGRENE. 66s to observe what slight injuries Avill induce gangTcnous inflammation under these circumstances. The nature of the tissue exercises, howc\'cr, considerable influence ; thus, witli a moderate amount of inflammation, some tissues very readily run into gangTcne, the areolar membrane especially being apt to do so ; M'hilst others, as the proper tissue of glands and organs, are seldom so affeeted. The specific charact&r of the inflammation influences greatly the disposition to gaugTene : some forms, as the carbuncular, invariably resulting in the loss of vitality of the part. In some states of the constitution, the blood appearing to be diseased, there is a gTeat liability to gangTone. Gangrene consequent on inflammation is of the moist or acute kind, being always connected with a retention of blood in the part affected. 'We may regard it as impending in a part that has become inflamed from injury or other cause, if we find that the redness becomes of a dusky or pinplish hue ; that bullte filled with dark fluid rise upon the surface ; that the swelling, at first hard, tense, and branmy, becomes of a pulpy or doughy character ; that the pain is of a dull, heavy, or burning kind; and that the temperatm’e of the part, at first greatly increased, gradually sinks. We know that gaugTene has taken place when there is a total loss of the sensibility of the part, even to pricking or pinching ; that the motion of the part itself ceases ; that its coloiu- changes to a peculiar mottled, purplish-red, or greenish-black hue, unlike anything else in the body ; that the temperature falls to a level with that of suiTouuding ah ; or that the smTace affected may, by evaporation, e^•en feel colder. There is likewise an odour e^'olved, differing from that of ordinaiy fost mortem decomposition, and evidently depending upon gaseous exhalations fr’om the part that has lost its vitality, and has at the same time become, while retained in connection with the living parts, the seat of putre- factive changes. The extent of tissue affected may vary from a mere spot to the implication of the gveater portion of a limb ; and the gangrene appears to be finally aiuested by the inflammation losing its force as it radiates from t le centie, until it reaches a part where it is sufficiently reduced to be com- patible with these processes of separation and repair which will be immediatelv described. The Consiitutional Sijmptoms, always of a low type, vary according to cir- cumstances. ^ If the blood be healthy, and the constitution sound, the gan- gi-ene occmTing as the consequence of sev'ere iujmy, the symptoms will present the ordinary character of inflammatory fever, though even in these cases there IS a great tendency to asthenia. If the constitution be broken, or the blood ni a diseased state, the constitutional symptoms will rapidly riui into the iiTitative form.

MORTIFICATION, OR GANGRENE. limits next the gangrono ; the lino, indeed, along which the dead and living parts touch. It extends along the whole dej^th of the gangrene, completely snrronnding it on all its attached sides. It appears to be formed exactly by the same process, and by the same mechanism, as that by which lymph is effused around any foreign body or fluid accumulation that has lost its vitality. Just as lymph forms the boundary wall to extravasation of blood, or to accu- mulation of pus in an abscess, so it forms a barrier, deposited in the living tissues, to separate them from the dead structures beyond, Avhich by their loss of vitality have become foreign to the adjoining healthy structiu'es. The inflammation, if any be j)resent, is re- duced in intensity at this part; it does not, however, cease abruptly, but fades away in the healthy structures beyond it. When the gangrene is airested, natme throws off the spoilt parts, not by a process of disintegration or falling to pieces of these parts, but by a vital act —a process of ulceration, extending through the line of demarcation, and loosening the slough or necrosed tissue by the softening and absorption of that layer of living tissue which lies next to it. This line of ulceration is termed the line of separation, and extends itself along the extreme inax’gin of the living tissues (Fig. 2GG). This process of separation, commencing at the edge of the slough, which gradually loosens, slowly extends downwards to the whole depth of the gan- grene ; if this affect the entire thickness of the limb, the ulceration v\ill find its way completely across it. If the slough be more superficial, the ulcerative action passes underneath it, and detaches it gradually. The line of separation is usually oblique, the soft parts being first divided, and the hard tissues then ulcerated through, until the ligamentous or osseous structures are leached, which are slowly acted upon. As the ulceration extends across the limb, the largest arteries and veins are cut through by it, without the occmrence of htemorrhage, ovsdng to a mass of plastic matter being poured out in their interior, and blocking them up from the line of separation to the nearest large coUateral branch above it. The period required for the detachment of gangrenous parts varies according to their extent. Small sloughs may e detached in a few days, whilst many weeks are required for the separation of a limb. The action is most rapid in the soft vascular tissues and in youug subjects. , After the separation of the gangrened part, a more or less ragged irregui ulcerated surface is left, which, if not too extensive, and the patient’s reparative powers be in a favomable state, wiU undergo cicatrisation by the same process as in ordinary ulcers. This indeed, commences while the separatioii is going on; granulations gTadually appeai-ing in that part of Jhc Ime separation wlh’ch has effected its purpose of cutting off t c ceac lom living parts. , DiAGXOSis.-The diagnosis is easily effected when gangi-enc has fully devcCONSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT OF GANGRENE. 667 loped itself; but iu the early stages, before it is positively declared, it is nob always easy to deteriiiinG its existence. The ecchymosis and discoloration of a bruise, the collapse and lividity that result from cold, or the daii pm^ile hue occasioned by long-continued congestion, may readily be confounded with im- pending gangrene. In these cases of doubt, the Siu’geon should not be in too great a huny to pronounce an unfavourable opinion, and still less to act upon it; for not luicommonly parts of the body which have to all appearance lost their vitality, may, under proper treatment, regain it. Progxosis.—So far as the part itself is concerned, the prognosis is always bad; though occasionally, when gangrene has not been fully established, partial recovery may imexpectedly take place. So lar as the life of the patient is at stake, much will depend on the cause of the affection, and on the age and strength of the individual; at advanced periods of life, and in a feeble state ol system, the result is always unfavourable. Also whilst the gangrene is spread- ing, the prognosis is bad, as it is impossible to say where the morbid action may stop ; but when a “ line of demarcation ” has formed, indicating the pos- session of a certain vigoiu’ of constitution, the principal danger is over, and the result will depend on the power of the patient, and the support that can be given during the processes of separation and of repair. Teeatmext.—As gangrene proceeds from a great variety of causes, it is e’^'ident that no one plan of treatment can be miiversally applied ; and it becomes necessary to modify our therapeutical and operative means, not only according to the cause of the disease, but also with special reference to the constitution of the patient, and with regard to the stage in Avhich we meet with the gangrene ; and, indeed, it often requires great tact and experience to accom- modate the treatment in this way to the varying phases of the disease. The Constitutional Treatment of gangrene is of the highest importance ; of greater moment, indeed, in the spontaneous forms of the affection than the local management of the disease. It has three principal aims : 1. To remove the cause if possible, and thus to arrest the gangrene. 2. To suppoi't the pow&rs of the system during the process of the separedion of the sloughs and dead tissues ; and 3. To lessen the irritahilitg of the nervous system. 1. In the removal of the constitidwnal cause, yfo, must look wholly to the condition of the patient’s system. If this be in an inflammatory or febrile state, we must have recourse to a modified antiphlogistic plan. Depressing remedies must be very sparingly used, the patient’s condition being usually not of such a natm-e as to bear lowering. It is very easy to knock down inflammation by energetic measures ; but, at the same time, the reparative poivei of the system may be destroyed, and the patient may not be able to rally. Inflammatory fever, however high it may be in the early stages, rapidly sinks after gangrene has set in, symptoms of an asthenic or an irritative type ensuing. Plence it is only before the occurrence and during the spread of gangrene, that lowering remedies can be employed ; for, when once ganoi’ene as ceased to extend, however high the action may have been that accomiDanied s progress, all the powers of the constitution will be required to maintain the p cess of separation of the sloughs, if they be extensive and deep.

An enfeebled state of the enealat.ou of the part or the eyetem generally may equally ol-2WliTIFICATI0N, OR GANGRENE. 668 sion or complicate the gangrene ; and there may be every possible combination between this and an active inflammatory condition. In these circumstances, it will be necessary to conjoin an antiphlogistic plan of treatment with remedies of a tonic, or even stimulating character. It is this plan of treatment that is conunonly found to succeed best in spontaneous gangrene ; here moderate anti- phlogistic remedies are perhaps required in the earlier stages, with a light nutritious diet and mild tonics as the disease ad\'ances ; and in the latter periods, when the constitutional symptoms become asthenic, stimiilants should be given. The best stimulants are wine or porter, according to the patient’s habits of life ; and these should be given in combination with nourishment, BO as not merely to raise the pulse, but to produce a more permanent tonic influence on the system generally. If much depression occur, the medicinal stimulants, especially ether, ammonia, and camphor, are of material sendee. The only tonics that are of much value here, are the preparations of cinchona bark and some of the vegetable bitters, as gentian and cascariUa ; and though the specific virtues that were formerly attributed to them can no longer be accorded, yet when they do not irritate the stomach, they are of unquestion- able service in combating the asthenic symptoms, and improving the digestive powers. In these cases I look upon cinchona bark, in combination with chlorate of potash and ammonia, as of undoubted value. 2. After the proper employment of moans calculated to remove the constitu- tional cause of the gangrene, the system must he supported against the dehili- tating influences that accompany the yn-ocess of ulceration and of suppuration necessary for the separation of the mortified parts. 'During this period, there is less irritation but more debility, and stronger tonics and stimulants can be borne ; but we should be careful not to o'^'erstimulate the patient. On this point it is extremely difficult to lay do'wn any precise rule ; every iDossible variety as to the quantity and quality of food and stimulus being required by different individuals. The safest guides are the state of the pulse and tongue ; if they improve, the means employed agree. At the same time hygienic measiu’es should be carefully attended to ; cleanliness and free ventilation, with the abundant use of the disinfectants, are of the first moment, so that the patient may not be poisoned by his own exhalations. 3. The third indication, that of lessening the irritabilitg of the system that always supervenes, and which is partly owing to the severity of the pain, and specific, as Pott supposed, yet in many cases, and especially in the gangrene of the toes and feet of old people, it is undoubtedly a remedy of the greatest value. A grain of solid opium may be administered advantageously ever) sixth, eighth, or twelfth hour, according to the effect which it is foi^ncl to produce ; care being taken that the bowels do not become confined ihe hiccup, which is often distressing, is best remedied by the administration ot partly to the shaken and depressed state of the nervous system, is best carried out by the administration of opiiun ; and although this drug may not act as a long should be made, which by gaping Avidely allowLOCAL TREATMENT OF GANGRENE. 669 and otlier fluids, and thus effectually relieve tlie vessels and the tissues. This is more especially the case where there is much loose areolar tissue, as in the penis or scrotiim ; or indeed in any part in which much tension is conjoined with the inflammation. The relief of local tension is of the first importance in cases of inflammation threatening to terminate in gangrene. By a free incision through the structures so aifected, as in phlegmonous erysipelas or cai-buncle, not only may the vitality of the aifected tissues be preserved, but the extension of gangvene, if it have already sot in, may be arrested, and the constitutional disturbance is at once lessoned : the strain on the blood-A'OSsels being taken off', the pulse falls, loses its sharpness, and great relief is afforded. In some forms of inflammatory sloughing, nature relieves the part by free hmmoiThage, asfr'om the dorsal arteiy in cases of acute gangrene of the j)enis : and it is not until this has taken place, that the gangrenous action becomes arrested. By incision, also, irritating effiisions and infiltrations are discharged, and thus one cause of sloughing is removed. Mild local antiphlogistic treatment of an ordinary character is likewise required. When the gangvene has been arrested, the foelor of the sloughs must he diminished by disinfectant applications, such as the solutions of the chlorides, carbolic acid, or charcoal and yeast poultices. The sejKiration of the sloughs shoidd be left as much as possible to natm’e, which is always fully able to accomplish this, if the patient’s strength can be kept up. The 'sdtality of the tissues in the proximity of and above the line of separation is very Ioav, and may readily be destroyed by any fresh action set up in them, there being always a danger of exciting inflammation to such a degree as to exceed that which is necessary for the adhesive variety, and to cause it to rim into the gangrenous form. Hence no attempt should be made to puU away sloughs not already separated, nor shoidd stimulants be applied to the living tissues. It matters little as to what is done to parts afready dead, which, when loosened, may be cut away ; but we must not meddle with those that are living. He- morrhage seldom occurs before the separation of the sloughs, but there is always danger of its happening during that process. If it occur, pressime or the actual cautery will be found the best means to arrest it; and, if these fail, ligatirre of the artery higher up the hmb, or amputation when practicable, might be required. The parts that are already gangrenous should be enveloped in lint soaked in solutions of carbolic acid, the chlorides of zinc or hme, or creasote, or dusted with charcoal powder and covered with a layer of wadding. Ho iroultices should be applied if the sloughs be large, heat and moisture hastening their decomposition ; but if they be small, yeast, carrot, or charcoal poultices may be advantageously applied. Parts that are quite dead, but that do not readily separate, such as tendons, ligaments, and bones, may be cut through with scissors, phers, or saws, and thus many weeks or mouths saved in their separation. It may occasionally be necessary in doing this to encroach on the living tissues ; this should bo f one as carefully and as sparingly as possible, for reasons already stated. The issues do not bleed much, owing to their infiltration ivith lymph. Ihe line of separation should be dressed with water-dressing, or witli Rnnw> mi d detergent lotion or ointment, in order to keep the siu’face clean and io670 MOIiTIFIGATION, OR GANGRENE. prevent the absorption of gangTenous and septie matters. If sloughs be not readily separated, the balsam of Porn, either pure or diluted with yolk of egg or A'ory dilute nitric acid, and opiate lotions, are the most useful applications. After the separation of the sloughs, the ulcerated surface must be treated on general principles. The Treatment op Senile Gangrene, presenting some peculiarities, requires a few words to bo specially devoted to it. Constitutional Treatment.—By some Sm'geons this disease has been treated on a strictly antiphlogistic plan, on the supposition that the obstruction of the arteries is caused by the inflammation of their eoats. This, hoivever true it may be in some of the forms of “ spontaneous gangrene ” arising from acute^ob- structiA'e arteritis in young subjects, is certainly an erroneous doctrine in the great majority of cases of dry gangrene oeem-ring as the result of senile ehanges in the A'essels of the lower extremities of aged persons ; and, though inflammation may occasionally afiect the calcified coats of an artery, or the parts supplied by such a diseased vessel, it is always a Ioav form of the disease, and does not bear depletion. Brodie very justly observes, that in these cases the local precursory inflammation terminates in mortification, because the inflamed part cannot obtain the additional supply of blood' that it requires; hence, if blood be abstracted from the system, and the action of the heart weakened, the cause of the disease Avill only be aggraA’ated. But, though depletory measm’es are not admissible, we must guard against running into the opposite extreme, and OA'er- stimulating patients labouring under this disease. Senile gangrene commonly occurs in individuals belonging to the wealthier classes of society, Avho haA*e lived high, taken insufficient exercise, and consequently induced an initable, plethoric, but enfeebled state of system. In many cases the patients are of a gouty habit, and occasionally the inflammation that precedes the development of the gangrene appears to be of this natiu-e. In this condition stimulants and the more powerful tonics are not Avell borne ; they heat the system, accelerate the pulse, and interfere Avith digestion. As Brodie observes, it is of great importance in this disease to attend to the state of the digestive oigans, in older that nutrition may go on, and that blood of a proper quahty may be made. In order to accomplish this, a hght nourishing diet, partly animal and partly vegetable, should be given, and a moderate quantity of Avine, beer, or brandy allowed. The boAvels must be reheved firom time to time by a rhubarb draught ■or simple aperient pill. Mercury depresses the system, and hence it should not be used as an aperient in any form in this disease, imless the state of the liver imperatively demand it. If the digestion become impaired, a stomachic, •as the infusion of cascarilla or the compound infusion of gentian AVith a little ammonia, may be administered. The administration of opium in these cases, as originally recommended by Pott, has received _ the_ sanction of almost every practical Siu’gcon. Brodic’s opinion on this point is especially valiiab e ; he says “ If I am not greatly mistaken, the result of a particular case will very much depend on this—Avhether opium does or docs not agree Awth the pafrent From tAvo to fom- grains of opium may be administered in divided doses 111 the course of twenty-four hours; the quantity being increased as the system becomes accustomed to its effeete. If, howcvei-. it distiivl. the .occasion headache, iiohvithstanding the use of aperients, as mil often happen671 AMPUTATION IN GANGRENE. when there is febrile disturbance in persons of a full habit of body, it must be discontinued, as it Avill increase the irritation of the system. The pain in the foot, which is often very severe during the progress of the disease, usually ceases of itself when the mortification is complete ; and before this, it is but little influenced by any sedatives, whether coiisLitutionally or locally applied. ■\^’’ith respect to the comparative advantage of the depletory and stinmlating plans of treatment in senile gangrene, I think it may fairly be stated that neither method should be api^lied exclusively ; that in those cases in which there is much febrile action, in which the tongue is loaded, the pulse quick, and the skin hot, in which the spread of the gangrene is preceded by a red angry blush, with much pain and heat, moderate diet and mild tonics will be most useful; whilst, on the other hand, when it is simply a shrivelling of the toes and feet, A^dthout any preceding increased local action, or febrile con- stitutional disturbance, a decided tonic or stimulating plan Avill succeed best. The Local Means to be employed in senile gangrene are simple. It is of great importance to keep up the temperature of the hmb, and to equalise its circulation as much as possible ; this is best done by the apj>hcation of cotton-wadding or of carded avooI in thick layers around the foot and leg, so as to envelope the limb completely in this material, over which a large Avorsted stocking may be drawn, or a silk handkerchief stitched. This dressing need not be removed more than once or tAvice a Aveek, unless there be much discharge from the fine of separation, when it must be changed more frequently ; the gangrened part itself should be coA^ered with a piece of lint soaked in chlori- nated lotion. “When the soft parts have been separated, and the bones of the foot exposed, these should be cut across by cutting-pliers or a small saAV, and the sores that result dressed in the ordinary way Avith some astringent lotion or slightly stimulating ointment. The balsam of Peru, either pime or diluted Avith an equal part of yolk of egg, is a very excellent application in these cases. In the event of recovery, the patient must be careful to avoid exposine to cold, and to keep the legs warmly clad at aU seasons of the year. Aaiputatioj^ IX Gaxgebxe.—The question of Amputation in cases of gan- grene of the limbs is of great importance to the practical Surgeon, and is one on certain points of which the opinions of the best practitioners still vary. At first sight it appears rational to cut off a limb that is dead, disorganised, and offensive ; and Avith propriety this may be done when the gangrene is, strictly speaking, a local condition, as, for instance, the result of a severe injiuy ; any affection of the constitution in such a case being secondary to the local mischief and dependent on the in-itation set up by it, and on the depression of the poA\ ers of life consequent on the efforts made by natm-e to rid the system of a spoiled member. But Avhen the eonstitutional disease is the primary affection and when the gangrene is consecutive to and dependent upon this, it would clearly be useless to cut off the mortified part, as the same morbid action might c pxobably Avould be set up in the stump or elseAvhere. Hence the broad ques ion of amputation m cases of gangrene tuims upon the fact of the mortifica- tion being local or constitutional in its origin. hen the pngrene is local, Ave usually amputate at once: cspeciallv when S' an artery. Here, for the reasons which have been given (jip. 214,672 MORTIFICATION, OR GANGRENE. ?)12), iuupntatioii should bo pcrlbrincd as soon as the gangrene has unequivo- cally inaiiilested itself, without waiting for the lino of demarcation. The result of amputation for traumatic gangrene is, on the Avhole, very unfavourable ; the patient very commonly sinking from a recun’ence of the disease in the stump, or fr’om the constitutional disturbance that had previously set in. Those cases are especially unfavourable in which the areolar tissue of the limb is much infiltrated and disorganised ; the affection indeed partaking more of the characters of constitutional disease, with some forms of which it is closely associated. There are two exceptions to the rule of amputating in traimiatic and local gangrene before the occurrence of the line of demarcation ; viz., gangi’ene from frost-bite, and that from severe burns. In these injuries it is better to wait for the formation of the line of separation, and then to fashion the stump through or just above it as the circumstances of the case require. In gangrene from constitutional causes, it is a golden ride in surgery never to amputate until the hue of separation has formed ; for, as it is impossible in these cases to say where the mortification AnU stop, the amputation might be done either too high or not high enough ; and, under any circumstances, the morbid action Avonld almost to a certainty be set up in the stump. It is not even sufficient in cases of this kind to Avait until the line of demarcation has formed before re- moving the limb ; these cases of spontaneous or constitutional gangrene liaAing often a tendency to remain stationary for some days, and then, creeping on, to overstep the line by Avhich they had at first appeared to be arrested. Besides this, the local distiu’bance and inflammation set up by the amputation might be too great for the lessened Autahty of the system or part, and might of itself occasion a recurrence of the gangTeue. Hence in these cases it is ahvays Avell to wait ViK. 267.-Sroiitaiicoiis Amputation in Gangrene of Right Foot strength and fitneSS foi ‘ on.l T.Aff i.PL'from Embolism. j.-l until the line of separa- tion has ulcerated so deeply that there is no chance of the gangrene overleaping this barrier, at the same time that means are taken, by the administration of tonics, nourishing food, &c., to improve the patient’s the operation. So soonBED-SORES. 673 this must be left to the discretion of the Surgeon ; but no procedm-es of this kind should be undertaken until the patient’s strength has been restored suf- ficiently to bear the operation. In senile [jangrene it has been proposed to amputate the thigh high up. This practice has lieen successfully adopted by Garlike, Janies of Exeter, and others, and certainly appears to deserve a trial in all cases in which the health is othenvise good and the constitution tolerably sound. It has not as yet been adopted in a sufficient number of cases to warrant a positive opinion on its merits ; but it would appear that, for its success, the amputation should be done high up in the thigh, so that there may be a better chance of meeting with a healthy condition of the vessels and good vitahty in the limb ; the operation being performed on the principle, that this form of gangrene is dependent on local disease obstructing the vessels of the part, and not always on constitutional causes. BED-SOBES. When a part of the body is compressed too severely, or for too long a time, even in a healthy person, it loses its vitality, and a local limited slough results ,• this separates, and an ulcer is left, which cicatrises in the usual way. But in certain deranged states of the health, more especially when the blood is vitiated, and the constitutional powers lowered, as diuing fever, or when the heart is diseased and weakened, more particularly if the patient be old and debihtated, or if innervation be acutely affected, and he be paralysed, the skin covering those points of the body that are naturally and necessarily pressed upon in the recumbent position, such as the sacrum, the trochanters, the elbows, shoulders, and heels, becomes congested and inflamed, assuming a dull reddish- brown colom-, and speedily becomes excoriated, often without any pain being felt by the patient. But one great cause of bed-sores is undoubtedly bad musing. It would not be just to say that a bed-sore is always the result of negligent musing. But it may truly be said that the chance of the formation of bed- sores, and their severity when formed, mil be increased or diminished in the exact ratio of the neghgence or care of the muse. It is not so much the actual severity of the pressure that occasions a bed-sore, as moderate long-continued piessuie applied to a part congested by position in a patient enfeebled by disease or want. If means be not taken to reheve the part from the injiuious compression to which it is subjected, and more especially if it be allowed to ecome instated by the contact of fasces or mine, the subcutaneous areolar tissue con-esponding to the inflamed patch wiU become extensively softened and doughy, being converted, with the skin covering it, into a tough greyish slough, fr-om under which a thin ichorous pus exudes. This slough may extend by a process of undemining of the integmneuts covering it ; and on its sepa- ration extensive mischief will be disclosed, the fascia and muscles beiim exposcc, or the bones even laid bare, and soon becoming roughened and ST: f me cases, even the inferior apertme of the spinal canal may be f,, ^ t^eath may result fr-om a low form of arachnitis, in consequence « tho spreading to the membranes of the cord.

At the same time, cleanliness and dryness should be carefully provided for by proper niu-sing, by the use of a draw-sheet, and fur- nishing the bedstead with the necessary arrangements of bed-pan, &c. The back should be periodically examined by the Surgeon himself. In certain low states of blood or nerve power, bed-sores of the worst character will very rapidly form. The skin on the exposed parts may be protected by the appli- cation of collodion or soap-plaster spread upon wash-leather or amadou, or isinglass on felt; or, what is better, it may be strengthened by being washed with spirits of wine, either pure or with two gTains of perchloride of mercury dissolved in each omice. In some cases much benefit is derived by timning the patient on his side and employing frictions of brandy and glycerine in equal parts. If the skin has become reddened it should be painted vdth a solution of nitrate of silver, of 5 gr. to 1 oz. If the skin have become chafed, the removal of pressure is imperative, and the abrasion may be washed over with collodion. If a sore have formed, it may be di’essed with the balsam of Peru, either pure or with zinc ointment, spread upon lint. In some cases also the prone couch may occasionally be advantageously substituted for the ordinary bed previously employed. When sloughs have fonned, their separation must be facilitated by the use of char- coal or chlorinated poultices, and the ulcers that are left should be dressed ■with astringent and aromatic appheations, such as catechu, tincture of myrrh, &c., and the utmost attention must be paid to cleanliness by the use of antiseptic lotions ; but no di’essing that the Sm’geon can apply ■will cause these ulcers to clean, and still less to heal, miless pressiu’e be removed and the patient s general health improve, and then they will speedily cicatrise under the most simple treatment. BOILS. A Boil is a hard circumscribed tumour of a violet or purplish-red colour, flattened, though somewhat conical, suppurating slowly and imperfectly, and always containing a small conical central slough of areolar tissue called a core. It consists of an inflammation of the subcutaneous areolar tissue and of the under surface of the true skin. The tension and hardness accompanying this affection render it extremely painful and annoying. It is most commonly seated in the thick skin of the back, the neck, or the nates. Causes.—Boils most frequently occur in young people, but are common enough at all ages, and are usually seen either in very plethoric or in very enfeebled constitutions, often Mowing some of the more severe febrile dis- eases, and attending convalescence from them. In other cases, the system appears to have fallen into a cachectic state, often without any evident cause, and this tenninates by a critical emption of boils. A sudden change m the habits of life, as from sedentary to active pursuits, a course of sea-bathiiig, cVc., Avill also occasion them. They are commonly met noth in the year, but may occur at all seasons, and arc occasionally epi emic.CARBUNCLE. 675 they take place they are often extremely tedious, crop after crop continuing to be evolved. In many cases they must be looked upon as salutary, as being the means adopted by natime to rid the patient of morbid matters that imtate the constitution, and which might, if retained, produce disease in it. Hence, after an outbreak of boils, the health often gradually improves. Treatment. The Constitutional Condition, on which the disease is dependent, requires to be cai-efully attended to. Ho one remedy is capable of curing boils. The disease is the result, in some cases, of fault or defect in nutriSon ; and the gi-adual modification and improvement of those processes that are subservient to it are necessary before the local eruptive affection will cease to appear. In other instances, it appears to be due to want of proper elimination of effete materials. Hence less is often to be expected from medicines in these cases, than from a general regulation of the hygienic con- dition of the patient. Hature will do more for his recovery than art; and the utmost that the practitioner can do is to administer such remedies as will assist in the improvement of the constitutional condition. If he be debilitated and cachectic, iron, quinine, sarsaparilla, and cod-liver oil; if he be plethoric, and his system loaded, purgatives, salines, and liquor potassee wiU be appro- priate. In the one case an abundant nourishing diet, in the other case a spare and simple one, with avoidance of stimulants, will be required. In some cases, empirical means are of service. Thus, when the disease is associated with pompholyx, or preceded by painful vesicles, arsenic may be of benefit. In other instances, yeast or charcoal has been advantageously given. The Local Treatment of boils is simple. When they are forming, the most useful dressing is a warm spirit lotion kept applied with lint and oiled sfik ; as suppm’ation comes on, a linseed-meal poultice, either simple or made with port wine, may be advantageously applied. Most commonly the boils may be allowed to break, when they discharge a thick pus, together with the central core, thus leaving a small cavity in and under the skin, which, however, soon fills up. The Surgeon may in some cases find it necessary to open them by a crucial incision when they are large, and do not appear disposed to break of themselves. When the boil commences as a small irritable pustule, it may occasionally be kept back by touching the point of this with nitrate of silver, or Muth a satm’ated solution of perchloride of mercury. CARBUNCLE A Carbuncle consists essentially of a circumscribed and limited inflamma- tion of the subcutaneous areolar tissue, rapidly running into suppm’ation and slough. The rapid formation of pulpy greyish or ash-colom-ed sloughs of the areolar tissue is characteristic of the disease, whether resulting from the specific nature of the inflammation, or, more probably, from the strangulation of the part by the accumulation of serum and blood, consequent on violent inflammatory action in parts the \i.tality of which has been materially lowered by constitutional depressing causes. Signs.—A carbuncle usually begins as a small pointed vesicle situated on a hard base of a dusky red colour. There is generally from the first a hot, X X 2676 MORTIFICATION, OR GANGRENE. burning, stinging, bcavy, or throbbing pain in the part, ont of proportion to the apparent gTavity of the disease. The contents of the A'csicle speedily become piu-iform, and are shed. The inflamed base then rapidly enlarges as a flat, painful, hard, but somewhat doughy, circumscribed swelling of the integuments and subjacent areolar tissue. The swelling is of a dusky red hue, slightly elevated, but never loses its flattened circular shape ; as it increases in size, the skin covering it assumes a purple or brownish red tint, becomes undermined, and gives way at several points, foivning openings through which ash-grey or straw-coloured sloughs appear, and from which an unhealthy pm-ulent discharge scantily issues. The size of the swelling varies from one to six inches in diameter ; most commonly it is about two inches across. Carbuncles are generally met with on the posterior part of the trimk, more especially about the shoulders and the nape of the neck ; being rarely seen anteriorly, or on the extremities. I have, however, had to treat very large carbuncles on the abdomen, and have met wdth them on the shm, forearm, forehead, lips, and cheeks. The Constitutional Disturbance attending this disease is always of the asthenic type ; the complexion is often peculiarly sallow or yellow, the pulse feeble, and the tongue loaded; and if the tumoin’ be large, or be seated on the head, death may take place, the patient sinking into a typhoid state. Causes.—A carbuncle usuaUy arises without any assignable local exciting cause ; but in some cases it is evidently directly occasioned by the intro- duction of some poisonous matter into a puncture in the skin or into a bair-foUicle. In aU cases it is associated with and dependent upon a disordered, usually a low, state of the constitution. Any condition that lowers the powers of the system wiU predispose to, and may at last occasion, carbuncle. Habitually bad and insufficient food, the exhaustion induced by chiunic wasting diseases, as diabetes, albuminuria, &c., or the debility resultmg from acute febrile diseases—more particularly typhus—may aU occasion it. Car- buncles are more conmion in the old than in the young, and in men than in women. . , , t«? • -(.o Diagnosis.—Carbuncle resembles loil in many points, yet differs in 1 gi-eater size, in the dusky red of the inflamed integument, in its broad flat character, and in the large quantity of contained slough in piopoition 0 small amount of pmmlent discharge, as weU as in the conditions in whic it o-enerally occurs. It also differs from a boil in its tendency to spread. A boil “comL to a head,” bursts, and discharges pus and slough ; a ^arb^ Im be discharging and sloughing at one part, whilst it spreads, hard and in carbuncle will depend on the size of the swelfliig on to situation, and on the state of the patient's that of his kidneys. The most dangerous carbimcles aie those hat aie lai,^ and situated or encroaching on the scalp ; m ao , e ““ is involued the greater the danger. If the ma, he recovered ftom i but if the kidneys be ^ eacLriiie diabetes, the progress of the disease cannot leadily be checked, the patient will usually sink.TREATMENT OF GARBUNGLE. 677 Treatment. The Constitutional Treatment musfc be conducted on Wie o-cncral principles that guide us in the management of low and sloughing inflammations. After the bowels hare been cleared out, the patient should be put on ammonia and bark if much depressed, or else the mineral acids and quinine. The latter in large doses, as much as five grains every four hours, is often of great service. Our great reliance in the more severe forms of the disease is, however, in the free administration of dietetic stimulants and good nourishment. The best medicine in such cases is undoubtedly port wine or porter, given as freely as the patient can take it. The mode of employment of stimulants is of gi-eat importance in these cases. As a general rule, that stimulant will agree best to which the patient is accustomed during health. Beer and wine should not be given together, but either will go well ’ivith brandy. In addition to stimulants, good and abundant nourishment should be given; meat, if the patient can digest it ; if not, soups, such as strong beef-tea, essence of meat, or turtle-soup. The brandy-and-egg mixture is also especially serviceable. Local Treatment.—In the very early stage, when the disease appears as a small, angry, pointed vesicle situated on a hard brawny base, its further lu’ogress may often be completely arrested by opening the vesicle, and rubbing its interior with a pomted stick of potassa cum calce or nitrate of silver. If the carbuncle have attained a somewhat larger size, though still small, the wisest plan is to cover it with a piece of soap-plaster spread on leather, having a hole cut in the centre, through which the pus and sloughy matters may be discharged. Beyond this, nothing will be required. When larger, it should be poulticed. In these cases the question will arise whether it should be incised or not; and, if incised, in what way the operation should be practised. Some Surgeons imiformly adopt incisions ; others, rvith equal constancy, reject them. I think that the exclusive adoption of either method is eiToneous, and that the most successful treatment consists in allowing the question of early incision to be determined by the amount of tension existing in and aroimd the carbimcle. Should the parts be soft, relaxed, and comparatively painless, no advantage can result from incision ; but, on the other hand, if the tension be considerable, the agony gveat, and the constitutional distiu’bance dependent on both proportionately intense, nothing gives such immediate rehef, local and constitutional, as early and free incision. This may be done in two ways; either subcutaneously, by entering a long bistoury at one side of the carbuncle, and making two or three subcutaneous sweeps through the inflamed tissues in planes of different depths ; or by a free crucial cut, carried fairly through the diseased parts into the healthy tissues beyond them. By either method the constitutional disturbance accompanying and resulting from the extreme tension is at once removed, the local progress of the disease is checked, and extension of sloughing by strangulation of the tissues is prevented, ohould incision of the carbuncle not have been pcrfomied early, it may ecome necessary at a later period, in order to prevent the confinement of le pns and slough. Poultices arc now to be applied ; these may be simply 0 mseed meal and water, or they maybe made more stimulating by the a (1 ion of port wine, yeast, or beer-grounds. As the sloughs loosen, they678 MORTIFICATION, OR GANGRENE. should be separated ; and the granulating surface which is left, and which Avill usually be fouhd to be sluggish in its action, should be di’essed with some of the more stimulating ointments, such as those of elemi, resin, or balsam of Peru. The ulcer, though large, will when thus treated cicatrise rapidly, and will leave but a small scar.DISEASES BY ABSOBPTION OF SEPTIC MATTER. 679 CHAPTER XXXI. DISEASES ARISING FROM THE ABSORPTION OF SEPTIC MATTER, OR THE PRODUCTS OF INFECTIVE INFLAMMATION. jMost Siu-g-eons include under this class Pyemia, Septicemia, and Hospital CangTcne, and some also the allied disease, Erysipelas. Before discussing this group of diseases more fully, it will be weU to consider the meaning of the terms employed. Septic (o-ijn-u, to make rotten or putrid) is used by most Awiters as almost synonymous Avith putrid; but the word is also frequently apphed to that condition of atmosphere brought about by overcrowding wounded patients, Avhich loads the air with decomposing animal products exhaled from their bodies, and effluvia fcom their discharging wounds. Thus, we speak of septic fever and septicEemia, meaning thereby, the fever or general blood- poisoning produced by the absorption of putrid (septic) matter from a wound ; and we say, a very foul ward is in a septic condition, and that the patients are exposed to septic influences. The term “infective" is used to denote ah in- flammation which, in the words of Biudou Sanderson, “ sjjreads and endures beyond the direct and primary operation of its cause, and which induces similar inflammations in other parts, and disorders the vital functions of the whole body.” It has been shown by Burdon Sanderson that this condition of infec- tiveuess may occiu in inflammations unconnected in any way vdth putrefaction. Such inflammations can be produced, experimentally, in animals, and acute necrosis of bone is a good example of them occiuring in the human subject. San- derson has also shown that all infective inflammations are characterised by the presence of minute organisms, bacteria or microzymes, in their fluid products. The poison in septic diseases is imdoubtedly a product of ordinary putrefaction; but in infective iifflammations uncomiected with putrefaction, it is supposed to be due to some j>eculiar change in the fluids of the inflamed part analogous to fermentation. What part the baeteria or microzymes take in the production of the poison, is stiU a disputed point, as is the similar question with regard to putrefaction. In actual practice, it is rare to see infective inflammations not connected in any Avay Avith the presence of putrefying discharges. For example, after an amputation, if a patient be attacked by septictemia or pyaemia at a time Avhen the discharges are in a state of decomposition, it is impossible to say Avith certainty Avhether the secondary disease is due merely to the absorp- tion of putrid matter, or Avhether some infective inflammation, specific in its nature, has given rise to a poison Avhich has infected the Avhole system. The Avell-known fact that many of the most virulent animal poisons, resulting from unhealthy inflammations, lose a considerable degree of potency Avhen alloAved68o SEPTIC AND INFECTIVE DISEASES. to decompose, clearly shows that iu these cases, at least, something more than the ordinary products of putrefaction must ho present. Pyaemia, scpticiumia, and hospital gangrene appeal’, in all cases, to be of septic or infective origin. Septic influences also play an important part as predisposing causes of erysipelas, yet it frequently occiu-s independently of them. The poison which produces these diseases is always animal in its origin. In surgical practice, its development is usually directly or indirectly the result of overcrowding of patients suffering from suppurating wounds or sores iu wards that are either insufficient in size, or that are imperfectly ventilated, or of defective attention to the hygiene of the wound itself. Under the influence of overcrowding of pus-producing Avounds, the atmosphere of the apartment becomes loaded with organic matter in a state of decomposition.* It has been directly shown, by experiment, that the ah’, under such circumstances, contains floating in it epithelium scales, and other organic particles; and as Parkes says, “ It is a question whether we shall not be obliged to beheve that every pus or epithelium cell, or even formless organic ■ substance, floating in the air, may, if it find a proper place or nidiis in or on which it can be received, com- municate to it its OAAm action, and thus act as a true contagium.” It has been established incontestibly that if the cubic capacity of a ward be taken, and the rate of ventilation through it determined, a Surgeon may with certainty foretell how many suppurating Avounds it AviU require to generate septic disease in it. If I may ventiu’e to use such an expression, I may say that a Sm-geon might at anytime ‘'grow” septic and infective diseases in a Avard by crowding it, beyond its capacity of healthy endimance, vith patients suffering from suppurating Avounds. These diseases occur therefore in direct proportion to the neglect of hygienic arrangements. They are in most cases the result of certain definite infringements of sanitary rules ; they are not accidental; they are preventable, and ought to be prevented, so far as they arise from hospital contammation. These diseases may probably be produced in several ways. If, as there is every reason to believe, the poison is in some cases nothing more than the ordinary products of decomposition, there is no difi&culty in understandmg how it may arise in the discharges of a Avound. If through uuskihul siu’gical treatment the serous, purulent, or sanious discharges, mixed Avith ah’, be pent up in deep cavities, decomposition must result; and the putrescent mattei, if absorbed, AviU give rise to pytemia and septicaemia. Healthy gTanulations seem to offer a powerful resistance to such absorption, but in contact AA’ith decom- posing matter at some degree of pressure they readily slough, and the barrier is then broken down. When, as is undoubtedly frequently the case, the poison giving rise to the disease is something specific, it is carried from one patient to another either by the atmosphere which has become impme from impertect ventilation, or by dirty dressings, instruments, or fingers. Another method is piu’ely hypothetical. It is supposed by some that a patient may imbibe tfr’ongh the lungs, and possibly the skin, some virus floating in the air, and that his blood may be thus contaminated and that the secretions of the woimd may become infectiv’e. This AdeAV is maintained chiefly with legar to eiysipe as, and its supporters adduce iu its tavoiu’ the folloAiing facts. 1. le cons i u tional symptoms frequently precede the local by many horns ; -. ujsip ■* See also Clwptors I. aiul II. •j \ I68i SLOiraillNG FHAGEBJENxL may arise in cases in wliich there is no wound ; and 3. The most careful auciseptic precautions, although powerful in the prevention of septicmmia and jjjcTinia, are far less so in erysipelas. Certain cases are also met with in whicli ah the symptoms of pymmia arise ivithout the existence of any external wound or sore. ” For instance, the pus from beneath the periosteum in acute necrosis has been found to contain bacteria at the time when the abscess was opened and before it could have had any direct communication ivith the air, and the poivei- fully infective properties of the inflammatory products of this disease are only too well known from the frequency with which it terminates in acute pymmia. In these cases it must be concluded either that the A'iriis rendering the inflam- matory products infective was spontaneously generated witliin the body, or that, having in some way obtained admission from without, it underwent furthei development and increase at the inflamed spot. Such cases as the above are, however, veiy rare, and shoidd in no way lead us to doubt that the vast majority of all septic and infective processes in open wounds arise from causes attacking the woiuid directly, and are the result of faulty sanitary arragements or of imperfect wound hygiene. ' Of the nature of the poisons causing these various diseases we know little. The obseiwations of Biuxlon Sanderson tend to show that they are “ incapable of diffusion (in liquids), and, therefore, in the strict sense insoluble,” and that they are invariably associated with the presence of microscopic organisms ; but evidence is stiU wanting to show certainly whether these organisms produce the virus, serve merely as carriers of it, or only coexist ivith it. Each view has its supporters. Experiments by Baxter, undertaken on behalf of the Privy Council, show that the most virulently infective products have their activity destroyed by disinfectants, such as carbolic acid, chlorine, sulphiu- dioxide, and potassic permanganate. There is reason to believe that the poison or poisons giving rise to pymmia and septicaemia are identical, the variety of the disease depending on circumstances to be discussed hereafter. The virus of erysipelas is probably specific and entirely distinct frnm that causing the two former affections. The same may be said of hospital gangrene. Thus, although the different septic diseases are developed by much the same methods, there is every reason to beheve that they do not aiise from the generation of the same septic influence ; but that each septic disease is ; the result of the impregiiatiou of the wound, or the contamination of the I system by a different poison, such poison being capable only of producing I its own special or specific disease. That this is so appears j)robable from the fact that septic diseases are not interchangeable ; that one does not run into the other; that one tyjDe will prevail at one period, another one at another time. Each is a distinct and specific affection, and though arising generally under the influence of the same favouring circumstances, each is the outcome of a special septic poison. AVe will now consider them more in detail. SLOUGHING PHAGEDENA. "^is affection, which is also known by the names of Hospital, Contagious, or ulpy Gangrene, is characterised by a rapidly destructive and spreading-682 SEPTIC AND INFECTIVE DISEASES. ulceration, covering itself as it extends by an adherent slough, and attacking open sores and wounds. It is rarely met with in its fullest extent, except in military practice ; the accumulation of a large number of wounded persons Avith suppurating sores under one roof, and the want of the proper cleanliness and attention during an active campaign, disposing to it. Overcrowding of a hospital is the most fertile cause of this disease, as well as of other septic diseases. It used formerly to desolate the civil hospitals ; but, thanks to the sanitary measures now generally adopted in these institutions, it has almost disappeared from them, though still an outlmeak of it occasionally takes place, more especially during the winter or early spring months, when, in consequence of cold winds, the windows are kept shut and ventilation is thus interfered Avith. But the occurrence of this foul disease is of itself condemnatory of the sanitary arrangements of the hospital in which it is developed, and in the present state of our knowledge is inexcusable. Local Signs.—When sloughing phagedmna invades a wound or open sore that has hitherto been perfectly healthy, the surface becomes covered with grey soft points of slough, which rapidly spread, until the whole of the surface of the wound is affected. At the same time the sore increases rapidly in super- ficial extent, and commonly in depth ; the snrroimding integument liecomes cedematous, swollen, and of a liA'id red colom*; the edges of the ulcer are everted, sharp-cut, and assume a circular outline; and its smfface is covered Avith a thick pulpy greyish-gi’een tenacious mass, which is so firmly adherent that it cannot be wiped off, being merely moved or sAA'ayed to and fi’o when an attempt is made to remove it. There is usually some dirty yeUoAvish-green or broAvnish discharge, and occasionally some bleeding ; the pain is of a severe biu’ning, stinging, and lancinating character ; and the foetor from the sm’face is great. The ravages of this disease, when fully developed, are very extensive. The soft parts, such as the muscles, areolar tissue, and vessels, are transformed into a grey pulpy mass, and the bones are denuded aud necrosed. The larger blood-A’essels resist the progress of the disease longer than any other parts, but may at last be exposed, pulsating at the bottom of the deep and foul chasm. There is, however, little risk of hemorrhage in the early stages : but, when the sloughs are separating, an artery may give way, and bleeding to a dangerous oi fatal extent ensue. Hennen states that there is most danger of this about the eleventh day. When the sloughs are throAvn off, in the form of reddish-broAvn or greyish-green, viscid, and pulpy masses, a very sensitive granulating sm-face is left, having a great tendency to bleed, and to be again invaded by the sloughing action. . Blackadder has described an nicerated form of this affection, m which a vesicle containing a bloody ichor forms, Avith a hot stinging pain; this breaks, leaAdng a circular ulcer of about the size of a spht pea. The ificcr once formed,''rapidly extends by sharp-cut edges into the siuToundiiig integument. „ , On the two occasions in Avhich I have had, m former years, the nity of Avitnessing outbreaks of this disease m University College Hospital, the sm-face of the woimds affected became rapidly covered Avith a yellowish-gi j pultaceous slough. In some cases there was haimoiihage , ni mos comm i a small quantity of foetid discharge only aa^us poured on , e eeges683 CAUSES OF HOSPITAL GANGRENE. became sharp-cut and defined, and the ulceration extended fui'ther m the skin by an eio-hth or a quarter of an inch than in the subjacent areolar tissue, i most inslanccs the disease was confined to the skin and areolar tissue, exposing but not usually invading the muscles and bones, though in some cases these were affected. The ulcers were somewhat circular, and Avere siUTOunded by dusky infiamed arcolm of some width. When once the morbid _ action was stopped, they cleaned rapidly, throAving out large vascular granulations. ^ Constitutional Symptoais.—In the early stage these may exhibit evidence of active fibril disturbance, with high temperature and quick pulse. But they soon subside into symptoms of asthenia and prostration. In the majority ot cases they folloAV the local iiwasion of the sore ; Blackadder, Hollo, Belpec , and WcUbank have all found this to be the case, and in the instances at Uni- versity College Hospital it certainly was so. Hennen and Thomson, on the other hand, state that the constitutional symptoms precede the local. In this I believe them to be certainly in error. They have confounded that state of iU health which occms in the wounded Avho are confined in the foul and reek- ing atmosphere of an over-croAvded military hospital, and which, predisposes to the invasion of hospital gangrene, or of any other septic disease, Avith the symptoms produced by the phagedasna itself. Causes.—All Avoimds and sores are hahle to be attacked in this Avay, but the disease most fi’equently affects those that are of recent origin ; the more chronic affections, and those that are specific, A'ery usually escape. It is m mihtary hospitals, dining actiA'e warfare, that sloughing phagediena is noAA" chiefly met with. The experience of many wars has led incontestably to the conclusion that hospital gangrene will certainly be dcA^eloped amongst the wounded if they are aggregated in large numbers under one roof, howcA’er large and well ventilated may be the building ; whilst, amongst the wounded Avho are treated in the open, or in “ hut-hospitals”—mere temporary sheds—it is all but uuknoAAm. Ho better illustration can be given of the undoubted fact that the disease is primarily generated by a septic, i.e., poisonously putrid state of the atmosphere occasioned by the accumulations of the exhalations from the wounds, bodies, excreta, and clothes of many injiued people collected into one building. Ovm-croAvding of patients, more particularly those Avith suppiuating Avoimds, in the same Award or room, is the great occasioning cause of hospital gangrene and sloughing phagediena. I belieA’e that in this way the disease may at ,qny time be produced. The last outbreak that occiured at University College Hospital Avas clearly referable to that cause, and to that cause only, more than a quarter of a century ago. In one of my wards, Avhich is intended to con- tain 15 or IG patients only, OA\dng to accidental and unaA^oidable circum- stances, 21 patients Avcrc admitted, and slept for one night, many of them haA’ing suppurating Avounds. The result Avas an outbreak of hospital gangrene, Avhich spread through the Institution, and Avas most serious and persistent. Next to overerowding, I believe that the most fertile causes of this disease are want of elcanliness and ventilation, and the retention of soiled and dirty dress- ings. The accumulation indeed, of animal exhalations from the sick and wounded, is a cause of various forms of Ioav fever and of allied diseases ; and hospital gangi-ene, when it occurs in these circumstances, may be taken as684 SEPTIC AND INFECTIVE DISEASES. eA'idcncc of the iulriiig'oaieut of the sanitary laws in accordance with which the arran<>'emcnts ot an hospital should be regulated. But though it commonly has its origin in this way, especially in the crowding of military hospitals after a hard-lought action, it is met with out of hospitals. Well-marked cases of this atfectiou, some of a rery severe character, have at times occuiTcd amongst the out-patients of University College Hospital. In these cases, as in many others, it is probable that the disease was occasioned by the neglect of hygienic conditions, in the close and ill-ventilated houses of the poor, aided possibly by some atmospheric or epidemic influence ; influenza, erysipelas, and phlebitis being also very prevalent. This had been observed at the time of the first occuiTence of the disease at our Hospital, in 1841 ; and it is impossible not to recognise a similarity of cause in these different affections. It is a highly con- tagious disease, and when once it has broken out it will readily spread from patient to patient by contact with nurses’ or Surgeons’ fingers, instruments, dressings, and above all if the pernicious custom of using sponges in wards be adopted. It is impossible to be too careful in these respects. It may also be carried by organic particles in the air, and thus be said to be “ in- fectious.” Treatment.—The preventive treatment of hospital gangrene may be deduced from a consideration of the causes that give rise to it. It ought never to occur in a civil hospital. Its presence there is the severest condemnation that can be given of the sanitary condition of the Institution, and is an evidence that those arrangements which ought to exist in every well-conducted hospital are neglected. By avoiding over-crowding it need never occm\ In military practice its prevention may almost to a certainty be secured by treating the wounded under canvas, in “ hut-hospitals,” or in the open. Should it break out, the building in which it has developed itself should at once be abandoned or destroyed. The spread of this fell disease may be prevented by at once isolating the affected patient, treating him in the open, putting him as it were in quaran- tine, alloAving no contact between his attendants and other patients. Should it have broken out in a Civil Hospital, the first pomt to attend to is to p)-e,vent the extension of the disease to patients who are not as yet affected. This may be done by separating those who have been seized with it from the healthy, by preventing overcroAvding of the hospital, ventilating the wards, washing the floors with a solution of the chlorides, whitening the walls, and fumigating the apartment with chlorine gas. Local Treatment.—The extension of the slough must be stopped by the free application of fuming nitric acid, or of the actual cautery, to the edges and surface of the ulcer. I have used both these agents, but prefer the nitric acid, if strong and freely applied, the sides and edges being AveU sponged with it. The actual cautery is, however, very useful in those cases in Avhich the smface J to be destroyed is very extensive, or if there be a tendency to haemorrhage. ^ Should it not reach the deeper portions of the sore, nitric acid may be fr-ccly | sponged into them. It is important to bear in mind that those escharotic 'I applications should be carried deeply, so as to affect the li\ing stiuctmes lying | beneath the tenacious gTey pulpy slough, and that their action be not ^ fruitlessly expended upon charring this, which is afready disoiganised. ence, jLOCAL TREATMENT OF HOSPITAL GANCRENE. 685 l)cfore the application of the caustic, the soft pulpy slough should be scraped off with a spatula. After the cauterisation a strip of lint, soaked in a strong solution of the watery extract of opium, should be laid around the margin of the ulcer, so as to cover the surrounding areola ; and the separation of the sloughs must be encouraged by the continued application of charcoal, yeast, or cfdorinated poultices. In many cases iodoform will be found preferable to caustics or the cautery. It gives little or no pain when dusted over the sore, arrests the progress of the sloughing action, and clears away the sloughs them- selves in a most remarkable manner. lYhen the sloughs have separated, and the surface of the sore has cleaned, it may be dressed with a lotion composed of one gTain of the sulphate of copper and five of the watery extract of opimn to an ounce of Avatcr. The granulations, Avhich are very luxuriant and vascular, Avill skin oA’er AAuth great rapidity ; and the cicatrix, like that of an ordinary biun, Avill contract A'ery firmly. Should arterial Immorrliage occur, it may be arrested by the application of a ligature to the bleeding point; but if this do not hold, as Avill probably be the case from the softened state of the tissues, the perchloride of iron or the actual cautery must be applied; or the limb must be removed if all other means fail. In some cases, though the sloughing action is checked at one part of the smface, it has a tendency to spread at another. When this is the case, it may be necessaiy to apply the caustic or cautery repeatedly. In other instances, the sloughing action cannot be stopped, but opens large arteiles, and destroys the greater part of the soft tissues of a limb ; and then it may be a question whether amputation should be performed during the spread of the disease, or the patient left to die of hEemorrhage or exhaustion. Such a contingency is not of common occurrence; yet it may happen and the operation be successful, as appears from the foUoAsdng case, though there would necessarily be great danger of a recurrence of the disease in the stump. The AAufe of a butcher applied at the Hospital, with a slight wound of the forearm, inflicted by a fold hook. It was dressed in the ordinary way, but in the course of a few days she returned Avith extensive sloughing phagedmna of the part. She was imme- diately admitted, and the disease Avas arrested by the enei’getic employment of the local treatment above described ; not, however, until after considerable destruction of the tissues on the inside of the forearm had taken place. She left the Hospital before the Avoimd was completely cicatrised, and retiu’iied in a few days Avith a fresh attack of the disease, more extensive and seinre than the first, AA^hich could not be permanently stopped, either by the actual cautery or by nitric acid. The radial artery Avas opened and required ligature, and the AAhole of the soft parts, from the AA'rist to the elbowq Avere totally dis- organised, and the bones exposed. There Avas noAv very seA'ere constitutional ]mtation, and the case Avas evidently fast hastening to a fatal termination. In these circumstances I amputated the arm midAvay betAveen the shoulder and elbow; and, notAvithstanding that the local disease Avas progressing at the ime of the operation, and that great constitutional disturbance existed the patient havmg a pulse of KO to 170, at which it continued for more than a ■■ccove.7; to which the free administratioii of 1 nine and stimulants gi’catly contributed.SEPTIC AND INFECTIVE DISEASES. 686 The Constittitional Treatment consists in as nourishing a diet as th-e patient will take, with a liberal supply of stimulants ; and these may be increased by the addition of the brandy-and-egg mixture, or of ammonia, in proportion as depression comes on, from five to seven grains of the sulphate of quinine should be given every four or six hours, with a full dose of opium at bed-time, or more fr’equently if there be much pain and irritation. GANCJEENOUS STOMATITIS, OR CANORUM ORIS. A peculiar phagedtenic ulceration, closely resembling hospital gangrene, is occasionally met with in the mouths of ill-fed children living in low and damp situations, most connnonly occurring between the second and sixth or eighth years, but more especially about the period of the second dentition. In its mildest form this affection presents itself as small, deep, and foul gi-eyish ulcers, on the inside of the lips or cheeks, attended with a red spongy condition of the gums and much foetor of the breath. Good food and air with nourishing diet, the administration of bark, with the chlorate of potash, and the use of chlorinated lotions, with the honey of borax, will soon bring about a cure. Signs of Canckum Okis.—The more severe form of the affection, the true Cancrum Oris, commonly occurs during convalescence from some of the eruptive diseases of childhood, or after the incautious administration of mercury during a weak state of the system. One of the cheeks becomes swollen, braivny, tense, and shining, being excessively hard, and presenting a red patch in its centre. In consequence of this swelling, it is often difficult to open the mouth ; but if the Surgeon can gain a view of its inside, he will see a deep and excavated foul ulcer opposite to the centre of the external swelling, covered with a brown pulpy slough. The gimis are tm-gid, dark, and ulcerated ; the saliva is mixed with putrescent matters ; and, as the ulceration in the mouth extends, the sweUing sloughs, and a large, dark, circular gangrenous cavity forms in the cheek, opening through into the mouth. During all this time the child suffers little, but, as the disease advances, it commonly becomes drowsy, and at last dies comatose. '\¥hen fully developed, this affection is most fatal. Eilliet and Barthez state that not more than one in twenty cases recovers. miii- Treatment.—The treatment is that of hospital gangrene. The sloughing mass shoidd be deeply cauterised with nitric acid, but not with the actual cautery, lest the cheek be destroyed ; the mouth should be syimged out with the dilute solution of the chlorides ; and the system supported with beef-tea, ^vine, and ammonia, in doses proportioned to the age of the child. After the cure of the disease, the cheek may be deeply cicatrised, contracted, and rigid, much in the same way as after a bum, requiring possibly some plastic opera- tion in order to enable the child to open its mouth properly.687 ERYSIPELAS. CHAPTEE XXXII. ERYSIPELAS. Erysipelas so frequently and seriously complicates most other surgical dis- eases and injm-ies, that its study is of the utmost importance to the practical Surgeon. It usually manifests itself as a peculiar and distinct form of inflam- mation of the skin, ha^iing certain special characters Avhich distinguish it from the ordinary inflammation already described. Erysipelas, or, as it may he termed, the Erysipelatous Inflammation, including all those yarieties of this condition that are usually spoken of as “ diffuse,” has a remarkable tendency to spread with great rapidity by contmuity of siu’face, to change its seat, and not to be limited by any adhesive action. It may extend itself over any continuous siuface; the skin, the areolar tissue, the mucous and serous membranes, and the hning membrane of arteries, veins, and lymphatics, are all liable to be affected. Hence, to describe it merely as a cutaneous disease, a dermatitis, as has often been done, is not only highly incorrect, but unphilosophical, and evinces a very limited acquaintance AAuth its true natiu’e. It affects the skin more frequently than other membranous surfaces, simply because the skin is more frequently than any other textime in the body the seat of wounds—the most common exciting cause of this disease. Indeed, not only must we look upon erysipelas as a disease that may affect any surface, external or internal, but we must consider the constitutional disturbance that takes place in erysipelas as the essential morbid condition. This, it is true, is usually complicated with diffiise inflammation of the integument and areolar tissue, and then constitutes one of the ordinary forms of erysipelas. But a constitutional fever may occur ot precisely the same type as that which we observe to precede and to accom- pany the local inflammation, Avithout any such complication. This I had special occasion to observe in a very fatal outbreak of erysipelas that took place in one of my wards some years ago. On that occasion, all the cases in which the cutaneous form of erysipelas appeared Avere marked by severe constitutional disturbance, attended by much gastro-intestinal irritation. But precisely the same type of general febrile symptoms, and the same irritation of the stomach and boAvels, occurred in patients in the same Avard irr Avhom rro local or surface nianifestation of the disease took place. The trire pathology of the diffrrse, Ioav, or erysipelatous inflammations has yet to be made out. They are all closely connected with one another, and are evidently blood or constitutional diseases, rrnder whatever name they go. The similarity of causes, of effects, and of con- stitutional disturbance, makes it probable that they are all essentially depen- dent on one common condition of the blood; and that the particular local mandestation that occurs is secondary to this, and perhaps in some deo-ree accidental, and dependent on varying local conditions. "688 ERYSTPELAS. A cliief chavactoristic of this ciysipelatous fever is its incomioatibility witlv the localisation of any inflammation that may exist at or occur after its invasion ; and hence, when it attacks the system, it causes already existing inflammations to become dilfnsc or spreading, and to extend themselves over any surface on which they happen to be situated. It is, in fact, the very antithesis of the adhesive inflammation ; and not only is it so, but when erysipelas attacks a woiind in which the healing process has made any progress, it has a tendency to disorganise the lymph that has been ah-cady deposited, to open up the wound, and to lead to the establishment of suppurative action in it. It is especially apt to cause those inflammations to spread, which have not already been localised by the deposit of adhesive matter. Hence, recent wounds are more liable to be affected by it than old, and more especially gTanulating ones, in which the inflammation has already taken on a plastic character, which requires to be overcome before the diffuse form can set in. The invasion of erysipelas is characterised by general malaise and depression, chilliness, and occasionally actual signs, gastro-intestinal disturbance, accom- panied by nausea, and sometimes by violent vomiting and purging. Cases have been recorded in which the first symptoms hav e been convulsions of an epileptiform character. During the chilliness the temperature rises to 103° or 104° F. • but the rise does not show the extraordinary fiiictiiations common in pymmia.' The constitutional disturbance, although usually at first sthenic, very speedily runs into an asthenic or irritative type, presenting in severe cases the usual typhoid symptoms-—a quick feeble pulse, brovoi tongue, pungent hot skin, and muttering delirium. The disease is truly an affection of debility ; it is in consequence of the want of a siilficieut degi’ee of power in the part, or in the system, for the deposit of plastic matter, and the limitation of the inflam- mation by this, that the local affection spreads itself unchecked along the smface it invades. The tendency that frequently exists in erysipelas to the occim-ence of sloiio-hiiio- and suppmation of the affected tissues, is a finther indication of the asthenic and low character of the disease. This Hew of the nature of the constitutional disturbance in erysipelas is of great importance m reference to the treatment of the disease, as it demonstrates the necessity of not lowering the patient’s powers too much during the early period of the affection, when it often temporarily assumes a truly sthenic character. _ Erysipelas is especiaUy apt to become complicated mth low visceral lufl^- mation ;* the membranes of the brain, the bronchi and the lungs, or the gastro- StestinH mucous surface, are commonly implicated in this way ; and it is often through these complications that death results. ■ CASsES.-Erysipelas may occm without any external woimd, injury, or lesion of any kind, the disease being occasioned by some externa agency such as cold uctiiJ iniiu-iously on a system previously disposed to it by habitual deiange- ment^of health ^Or it may be directly excited by the infliction of a vound in an iiidmdiial who is either strongly predisposed to this affection by previous an Perano-ement or who is after the receipt of this injiu-y exposed constitutional de c ^ t, ^ ^ of the disease. Erysipelas may to circumstances : 1. Those that are intrinsic to689 CAUSES OF ERYSIPELAS. lias habitually been exposed, or by which he is surrounded after the injury or operation to which he has been subjected. I. Intrinsic Causes.—The great iwedisposing cause of erysipelas is to be sought for and will be found in a want of atteniion to hijcjienic conditions. It is one of the penalties inflicted by natine on those who neglect those prime requisites of health—temperance and cleanliness, or who are incapable of ob- taining good food and pure air. '^V’ere the laws of hygiene attended to as they should be, erysipelas and the allied diffuse inflammations would rarely be met with in surgical practice. Some persons appear to be naturally predisposed to erysipelas to so great a degree, that the application of cold, or slight stomach- derangement, or a triiral superficial injury, may excite it. This predisposition is most generally acquired by habitual derangement of health, and is especially induced by any of the depressing causes of disease, such as over-fatigue, anxiety of mind, night-watching, and habitual disregard of hygienic rules as to diet, exercise, air, &c. The habit of body, however, in which erysipelas is most frequently met Anth as a consequence of very trivial exciting causes, is that Avhich is induced by the habitual use of stimulants to excess. It is more especially in that state of the system characterised by an admixtime, as it were, of instability and of debihty, in which inflammation is not followed by the deposition of plastic lymph, but has a rapid tendency to the formation of pus and slough, and to extension of disease in a diffuse form, that erysipelas is very readily induced. This state is met with amongst the laboiu’ing poor, as the result of the privation of the necessaries of life, conjoined with the habitual over-use of stimulants and exposure to the various depressing conditions of bad food, impiu’e afr, &c. Amongst the wealthier classes it occurs as a consequence of high living, want of exercise, and general indulgence in luxurious and ener- vating habits. Some diseased states of the Ulood appear to predispose, in the highest degree, to the supervention of erysipelas. This is especially the case in diabetes, and in disease of the kidneys attended by albuminuria. As a consequence of renal disease, erysipelas often occiu’s idiopathicaUy, or from the most trivial causes ; such as a scratch, the sting of an insect, or any of the minor operations in surgery, more especially about the lower part of the body. Not only is it readily induced in this AA'ay, but it will extend in an uncontrollable manner in t cse states of the system, and Avill often assume a gangrenous form, there being apparently na utter want of limiting or reparative power in any inflammation, however set up. Persons of a gross and plethoric habit, with a tendency to gout, are predisposed to the occm-rence of erysipelas. The blood-degeneration that attends malignant disease peculiarly disposes to erysipelas, Avhich accord- ing y more frequently takes place after operations on persons having such diseases than after the removal of simple tiunours. Persons whose nervous systems ai'o habitually depressed, the semi-idiotic and idiotic for instance, are very prone to low diifrise and sloughing inflamma- tions of an erysipelatous form. patient circmnstances that surround the atmnQr.h ’ pvoductioii of this disease, season of the year and atmospheric changes exercise a marked influence. Erysipelas I nsnn v suppos^e^^ to JO more frequent in the spring and autumn, and the experience at Y YERYSIPELAS. 690 University College Hospital during tlie past four years, for which time the records of such cases have been very accurately kept, tends to confii-m this idea. Thus we find that during the years 1871-2-3-4, 151 cases of erysipelas ■were treated in the Hospital, including those admitted for the disease and those affected by it while undergoing treatment for other affections. Of these, 34 occurred during the cold months of December, January, and February; 43 during March, April, and May ; 22 during the hot months of June, .July, and August; and 52 diming September, October, and November. It is an interest- ing fact, that during these four years only one case arose diming the month of ,J Illy. It has frequently been asserted that erysipelas often breaks out on the setting in of cold easterly winds or on sudden atmospheric changes. Observa- tions were made diming one year (1872) at University College Hospital with the view of testing the truth of this assertion ; but, as they were not continued after that year, the time over which they extend is not sufficient to exclude chance from the results. As far as they went they tended to show that mild damp weather, inth westerly ivinds, is a more powerfid predisposmg cause of erysipelas and other hospital diseases than cold dry weather with easterly winds, that is to say, exactly the reverse of the popularly received opinion. The subject is one of great interest, and is well worthy of frmther investigation. Erysipelas often becomes epidemic as the result of peculiar, but at present in- explicable, conditions of the atmosphere. Thus at University College Hospital the number of cases occurring during the four years before mentioned was as follows : in 1871, 29 ; in 1872, 29 ; in 1873, 2G ; in 1874, 67. And not only was it at University College Hospital that this excess of erysipelas was noticed, but every similar institution in London suffered in the same way. It will usually be found that, when erysipelas is very abundant among the in- patients of a hospital, similar cases present themselves for treatment in the out-patient department, and at the same time it isusuaUy noticed that phlebitis of varicose veins, epidemic catarrh, acute tonsillitis, and other allied affections prevail. Epidemic erysipelas may vary in its type. Thus the epidemic of 1874 was chiefly of the cutaneous variety, and was accompanied by comparatively slight tendenc/to gangi-ene or sloughing ; while that of 1872, in Edinbmgh, was of a violent phlegmonous tyiie, usually attacking the subcutaneous tissue and leading to extensive diffuse sloughing and suppmation. _ But not only is erysipelas epidemic ; it is also contagious. The contagion erysipelas, after liariirg been repeateefty denied, can no longer bo contests Tmvers Copland, Bright, Niinneley, and others, have adduced cases in pioot of ils ciSns charier; and instances have repeatedly Men under my own observation, in which erysipelas, often unfortunately fatJ has been communicated to the servants, nurses, or relatives of patients ^ ' A remarkable proof of the contagious nature of erysipelas • fm. nf 18^1 in one of my wards at University College Hospital. I lie Ho“pftaUmcfti;”ftrftL Iry c.es of the hind —l^n^ rvhA on the 16th of Jannaiy, at abont noon, a man ^ ^Mdin'g tU precantions, however, two 1691 EXCITING CAUSES OF ERYSIPELAS. (lays after this, a patient, from M'hom a necrosed portion of ilium had been remo\-cd a few weeks previously, and who was lying in the adjoining bed to that in which the patient with the erysipelas had been temporarily placed, was seized with erysipelas, of whicli he speedily died. The disease then spread to almost every case in the ward, and proved fatal to several patients who had recently been operated upon. In some instances patients were affected with the constitutional symptoms without any appearance of local inflammatory action, but characterised by the same gastro-intestinal irritation that marked the other cases. Erysipelas may not only spread in this Avay fr-om patient to patient, but any tliffusc inflammation, as phlebitis, inflammation of the absorbents, low or j)ucr- pcral peritonitis, may give rise to external erysipelas, and in its turn be occa- sioned by it—a strong argument in favour of the allied or even identical natiu’e of all these affections. Then, again, the mitact of dead or putrescejit animal matters with recent woimds may occasion it. In this way the disease is not uni'requently originated in hospitals by dressers going direct from the dead- house, and especially from the examination of the bodies of those who have died of diffuse inflammation, to the bedside of patients, without taking suffi- cient care to wash their hands or change their clothes. For this reason also it is of great consequence that the same instruments be not used for practising operations on the dead, and performing them on the living body. Overcroivcling of hospitals, and want of froinr ventilatmi in wards or rooms, are fertile sources of erysipelas, and of the allied low inflammations ; in fact, an outbreak of ery- sipelas might at any time be induced in this way amongst patients in all other respects healthy and well cared for. The principal Exciting Cause of erysipelas is certainly the fresence of a wound. It is chiefly recent wounds, however, that are affected ; when once the adhesive or suppurative inflammation is set up, the wound is not so hable to take it on unless it be in bad constitutions, the formation of limiting fibrine appearing to lessen the hability to the occinrence of the disease. When erysipelas is epidemic, it is well for the Sui’geon not to perform any operation that can conveniently be postponed ; and in no case should a patient on whom an operation has recently been performed be put in a neighboiuing bed to a case of erysipelas, or even m the same ward. The size of the wound has little influence on the occuirence of erysipelas, which takes place as readily from a small as a large one. But although the mere size of a womid does not influence the liability to the occurrence of erysipelas in it, which will as readily follow a puncture as an amputation-wound, yet its character does. Thus, lacerated wounds are much more liable to be followed by erysipelas than clean-cut incisions. And the depth of the wound influences in an important manner the se’s'erity of the erysipelas, which is more intense in those injuries that penetrate the fasciae, even though this be cut to a very imited extent, when the disease may spread widely and fatally through the deeper subaponeurotic and intennuscular planes of areolar tissue. Injuries a lout the head and hands are those that are most liable to be followed bv this disease. ^ But, though we must constantly bear in mind the constitutional nature of eiysipe as, it will be more convenient and practical to describe it as it affects Y T 2ERYSIPELAS. 692 (lifFeront tissues and organs. With this view, we may divide it primarily into External and Internal Erysipelas, EXTEBNAL EBYBIPELAS. External Erysipelas is that variety of disease which affects the skin and snbentaneons areolar tissue. This form has been deseribed with an absurd degree of minuteness, so far as the transitory and accidental characters of its duration, shape, and appearance ai'e concerned, by many of the vniters on Diseases of the Skin ; who, in their anxiety to record minute and often accidental shades of difference in appearance, have entirely lost sight of the true nature of the disease. The division adopted by Lawrence into the Simple, the CEdematous, and the Phlegmonous forms, is a practical arrangement that is commonly adopted by Sm’geons. I prefer, however, and shall adopt, the division made by Nxmneley in his very excellent work on Erysipelas, as founded on the true pathology of the affection. He arranges external erysipelas under tlmee varieties : 1. Cutaneous ; 2. Cellulo-cutaneous ; and 3, Cellular. 1. Cutaneous Erysipelas is the shghtest form of the disease, implicating merely the skin; it comprises many of the species of erythema of different writers, and corresponds to the simple erysipelas of Lawrence. Local Signs.—A patient is seized with rigors, alternate chills and flushes, followed by headache, nausea, a quick pulse, a coated tongue, and hot skin ; in from twenty-four to forty-eight horn’s the rash appears, though sometimes it comes out simultaneously with the constitutional distm’bance. If there be a wound, its secretions dry up, and the margins become slightly swollen, and affected by the red blush. If the disease occur idiopathically without a wound, it most commonly appears upon the face, next upon the legs, and lastly upon the trunk. The rash is of a uniform but vivid rosy red hue, sometimes becoming dusky, and always disappearing on pressime; when advancing it is characterised by a sharply defined border slightly raised above the healthy skin, but when subsiding it fades away into the colour of the healthy skin. It is accompanied by some slight cedematous swelhng, fr-equently only recoo-nisable by the permanent impression left by the finger nail pressed on the skin^ but which is often considerable Avhere the areolar tissue is loose, as in the eyehds and scrotum, and there is usuaUy a stiff bm-ning sensation in the part, and not unfrequently greatly increased sensibility. Vesicles or bifite often form, containing a clear serum, which speedily becomes turbid and dries into fine branny desquamation. The redness may spread rapidly along the hnib 01 trimk, or, if the face be affected, may travel quickly from one side to the 0 hei, causing such swelling of the eyelids as to close them, and gmng rise ^ sne ^ and much tensive pain in the ears. The disease is almost f ^ “ nanied by some enlargement and tenderness of the lymphatic glands. In some cases this may even precede the rash. Sometimes the disease disappears in 01 prt of the body and 'reappears in another. This, whieh is Often a dangerous form of the affection, occin-i’ing in and indicating the approach of death. In these varieties f pelas, Ai-nott states that the fauces ai’c always involved. . abscesses not usually induce any serious mischief in t e ‘ pyoiiqs. form, more especially in the loose areolar tissue of the neck and 0 y693 CELLULO-CUTANEOUS ERYSIPELAS. ■\Vheu the inflammation is passing off the pain abates, the colour fades, the swelling subsides, and the cuticle, that has been detached by the serous transu- dation, flakes off in thin layers. In other cases, oedema of the part continues, with some in-itability and redness of the skin and peeling of the cuticle ; and in some rai-e cases the simple erysipelas seems to take on a gangrenous or slough- ing character, especially about the umbilicus and genitals of young children. The Consiitutional Symptoms of the cutaneous or simple erysipelas present every variety between the sthenic and asthenic foi-ms of inflammatory fever. "When the disease occurs in London, it certainly most frequently assumes a low type. There is also in most cases a good deal of derangement of the digestive organs ; the tongue being much coated, there is tenderness about the epigas- trimn, the evacuations are dark and offensive, and not unfrequently there is diarrhoea. When the scalp is affected, severe headache, vrith symptoms of cerebral inflammation, are often met vith ; indeed there is always a danger of the supervention of cerebral compheations in cases of erysipelas of the face or scalp, and it may be said that the cutaneous form of erysipelas disease seldom proves fatal imless the scalj) be affected, and the brain consequently implicated. Even after a comparatively slight attack the patient is usually much reduced in strength, being frequently left in an ansemic and emaciated condition. •2. Cellulo-cutakeous or Phlegmonous Eeysipelas differs from the last variety in the degree of inflammation, and in the depth to which the tissues are iiu’olved. The intensity of this form of inflammation is so great that it invariably terminates, if left to itself, in diffused suppuration and sloughing. In depth it always extends to the subcutaneous areolar tissue, and, though generally bounded by the underlying fascirn, it not unfrequently implicates them if they have been opened up, and extends to the intermuscular areolar planes, the sheaths of the tendons, and other deep structm’es. Local Siyns. The cellulo-cutaneous or phlegmonous erysipelas is ushered in ])y the ordinary symptoms of inflammatory fever, accompanied or followed by the signs of severe inflammation in the part affected. The redness is uniform, of a deep scarlet hue, and pretty distinctly bounded ; the pain is fr’om the first pungent and burning, though it may soon assume a throbbing character ; the sv elling, at first soft, diffused, and admitting of distinct pitting, soon increases, and becomes tense and bra^vny, the skin being evidently stretched to its full extent, and the part appearing perhaps to be twice its natimal size. Large ■\esications or^ blebs containing sero-piumleut fiuid, sometimes of a sanious tinge, appeal in many cases. This condition usually continues up to the sixth 01 eighth day after the invasion of the disease, during the whole of which time tie constitutional symptoms have presented the ordinary type of sthenic in- ammatoiy fever ; about this time, however, a change commonly takes place, w Cl for better or for worse. If, under the infiuence of proper treatment, and m a 0 erably healthy constitution, the infiammation subside, resolution takes p ace, with a gradual abatement of all the symptoms. If, however, as usually appens, tie disease runs on to more or less sloughing or suppuration of the pm , no mcroasc of the swelling, pain, or redness takes place, but, on the con- ^iinmution of these signs may occur, and thus give rise to a decep- nart becomes daaldy congested, and tlie pmt, instead of being tense and brawny, has a somewhat loose, soft, and boo-o-y694 ERYSIPELAS. feci, communicating a scmi-fiuctuating, doughy sensation to the fingers. Tliis change from a tense brawny state to a semi-pulpy condition indicates the forma- tion of pus and slough beneath the integument, and occins without any material alteration in tbe size, colour, or general appearance of the part, but can only be detected by careful palpation; hence the Simgcon must daily examine with his own fingers the state of the part, and neither trust to the reports of others, nor to the general appearance of the diseased structiu’cs, for a know- ledge of the probable condition of the subjacent tissues. If an incision be now made into the affected part, the areolar membrane will be found loaded with an opalescent fluid distending its interstitial loculi, but not flowing from the wound ; the retention of this fluid gives a gelatinous appearance to the sides of the incision, Avhich rapidly degenerate into slough and pus. If the alteration in structure have advanced to a stage beyond this, the areolar tissue will be found to have been converted into dense masses of slough, bathed in thin and unhealthy ichorous pus ; these sloughs have not inaptly been compared in appearance to masses of decomposed tow, of wet chamois leather, or to the membranes of an embryo a few months old. Whilst these changes are going on below the siuface, the skin, at first congested, becomes somewhat paler, and assumes a white or marbled appearance, rapidly forming into black sloughs, and being undermined to a large extent by large quantities of broken-up areolar tissue and of ill-conditioned pus, without any appearance of pointing, however extensive the subcutaneous mischief may be. These destructive changes expose muscles, fascice, and blood-vessels, and may induce necrosis of the bones or destroy the joints. They occur most readily in those parts of the body that possess the lowest degree of vitahty, and hence ai'e more common in eiysipelas of the legs than in the same affection of the scalp. If the patient recover, there udll be tedious cicatrisation of the deep cavities that are left, or con- siderable oedema, often of a solid character, a kind of false hypertrophy of the part, which may continue for some considerable time. In other cases, there may be such extensive local destruction or gangrene of the soft tissues, with exposure and death of the bones or suppmation of the joints, that amputation of the limb may be required to save the patient’s life. No operation of this kind, however, should ever be practised for the effects of erysipelas, imless they be strictly localised, and without tendency to spread; nor until specific consti- tutional fever has been completely removed, except such as is ot a hectic character, and dependent on the exhausting influences of the suppuration and disorganisation of tissues. During the progress of these local changes, the Constitutional SymiAoms have assumed corresponding modifications. At fii'st of an active inflammatory character, the fever, when suppmation and sloughing have set in, often si - denly becomes asthenic. Although in some cases there is at fii-st no dimim - tion in the severity of the symptoms, the constitution gives ^ the patient has struggled for a few days against the exhaustmg licences o the disease, and death speedily supervenes. If the patient ® sloughing, and if the discharge continue abundant, hectic, gastro-intestinal irritation, metastatic abscesses, oi pytemia, may .

The immediate danger is always greatest when the head is affected, from the extension of the disease to the membranes of the brain, and the supervention of arachnitis. The remote danger from the effects of suppuration of aa-colar tissue, necrosis of bones, and inflammation of the joints, is greatest when the lower extremities are the seat of erysipelas. A ^•al•iety of the cellulo-cutaneous erysipelas has been described as (Edema- tons Erysipelas. By this is meant not merely the effusion into the areolar tissue which occurs in all the varieties of the disease, but a peculiar fonn, spe- cially marked by oedema of the areolar tissue, with less inflammation of the skin than usual. There is much swelling, Avhich pits deeply on pressure, with but little pain or tension, and but moderate redness of the skin ; the constitu- tional symptoms are less marked than in the other varieties of the disease ; it is principally met noth in old people, or in persons of a dropsical tendency, in whom it ocems especially about the legs, scrotum, or labia, sometimes giving rise, by the effusion of a sero-plastic fluid, to permanent and solid enlai-gement. 3. Cellular Erysipelas, or, as it is often termed. Diffuse Inflammation ■of the Cellular Tissue, or Cellulitis, has been particularly described by Duncan, Arnott, Lawrence, and Nunneley. It always arises frrom a wound or injury, often of an apparently tririal character, and most commonly affects'the subcutaneous areolar membrane, though occasionally it extends to the subapo- neurotic tissue, and then is a more severe and dangerous affection. Though commonly arising as a consequence of ordinary injiuies, it is especially apt to follow those in which there has been any inoculation of animal poisons, as fr'om dissection-wounds, the stings of insects, and the bites of venomous reptiles. In whatever way arising, it is characterised by the rapidity and extent of the sloughing of the affected tissue, and by gxeat depression of the powers of the constitution. That the diffuse inflammation of the areolar tissue, whether it be limited to a finger, or implicate the areolar tissue of half the body, is a Tariety of erysipelas affecting this textiue primarily, and the skin secondarily, there can be no doubt. The points of resemblance between cellulitis tmd erysipelas have been well shown by Nunneley. Not only are the local effects precisely the same in the two diseases—the swelling, tension, infiltration of pus, and formation of gangrenous shreds and sloughs ; but the constitutional symptoms, though varying peihaps in degree, present no difference as to character. The results also are identical, there being the same local impair- ment of structure, the same tendency to involve parts at a distance, and to the formation of secondary abscesses. These two forms of disease occm- in the same constitutions, in the same states of the atmosphere, and in the same situation; one may produce the other; and, lastly, the same treatment is required for both. Local Sifjns.—There are great swelling, tension, and pain in the hmb, which feels braAvny in some parts, oedematous in others. The skin is slightly reddened in patches, has a mottled appearance, and speedily runs into blackish sloughs. le extent to which the disease may spread varies greatly ; when once it has set m, it commonly runs rapidly up the Avhole of a limb, extending also to the 0 the tmiik ; in other cases, its violence appears to be principally expended at a distance from the seat of injury ; thus, in a case of a punctured6g6 ERY8IPELAB. wound of the finger, the diffi;se inflaniination may principally take place in the extended planes of areolar tissue about the axilla and sides of the chest. It is important to bear in mind that this form of erysipelas sometimes affects the internal planes of areolar tissue. Tins may happen, for iiistance, in the fasciae of the pelvis after lithotomy, or in the anterior mediastinum after opera- tions at the root of the neck. The sloughing often occurs with remarkable rapidity in the course of thii’ty-six or forty-eight hours, the areolar membrane being broken down into ill-conditioned pus and shreddy sloughs, more especially Avhen the disease has resulted from the inoculation of an animal poison. Death, may in such cases occiu’ in two or three days ; in other instances, several weeks may elapse before a fatal result declares itself. The Constitutional Sijmptoms are those of asthenic fever in the most marked degree ; a quick and feeble pulse, brown tongue, and muttering delirium, being early concomitants of this affection. Post Mortem Ajpoearances.—After death fr’om erysipelas, the internal organs present nothing that is characteristic. As in all diseases accompanied by high fever and general blood-poisoning, the epithelium of the kidneys and liver is found in a state of cloudy sweUing, and the spleen is in some cases enlarged. The lungs are usually congested. Sometimes marked post mortem staining of the blood-vessels and organs is foimd very soon after death, and occasionally small petecllim are scattered beneath the serous membranes. It has been lately stated by Lukowsky, that, at the advancing line of the rash in cutaneous erysipelas, the lymphatic vessels and spaces of the skm are found to be packed with minute organisms (micrococci), which are not present when the eruption is receding, or in the parts over which it has j»assed; but this assertion requires confirmation. DiAGiSrosiS.—The diagnosis of the various forms of erysipelas is generally easily made. From the exanthemata, it is distinguished by the character of the eruption, its limited extent, and usual complication with injury. From inflam- mation of the veins or of the ahsorhents, the diagnosis is not always easy, more especially as the two conditions frequently co-exist. If it be a vein that is inflamed, the general absence of cutaneous redness, the existence of a hard round cord, and the tenderness along the coiu’se of the vessel, are sufficient to establish the diagnosis. In inflammation of the absorbents, the redness is not uniform, but consists of a niunber of small and separate red streaks, running in the direction of the lymphatics, and affecting the glands towards which they coinse. These two affections, however—erysipelas of the skin and inflammation of the absorbents—are almost invariably conjoined ; hence a definite diagnosis is not of much importance. PnoaNOSis.—The prognosis in erysipelas is always grave. It may bo dan- gerous to the part affected, or to the life. The ceUulo-cutaneous variety is very dangerous to both ; more .especially if it be traumatic ; if it affect the head oi parts in which the areolar tissue is abundant and lax, as the scrotum and orbit. There may be special danger even in the slighter forms of erysipe from the seat of the affection, or of asphyxia when attacking the fiuices. Uj groat cause of danger in erysipelas, and that renders it so epiessiUj, ^ , strength and so fatal a disease, is its constantly progressive tendency, so tuat whilst fading on one side it continues to extend on the otici. o in el^^697 FREVENTION OF ERYSIPELAS. time is thus left for constitutional rally, or for recovery of strength. The/ww of the disease influences greatly the result; the cutaneous variety being attended with least danger, the cellular with the most. Tlie danger in erysipelas vnll depend gi-eatly upon whether the disease be traumatic or idiopathic. The traumatic is infinitely the most dangerous. This is probably due to the ad- mission of air, and the accompanying organic matter, into the inflamed cellular tissue through the wound. The same condition, indeed, that renders an open Avound much more dangerous than a subcutaneous one, renders traumatic infinitely more fatal than idiopathic erysipelas. Much also depends on the seal of the affection; that attacking the head and loAver limbs being the most dan- gerous ; encephalitis being apt to ensue, Avhen the head is affected. When the legs are extensiA'ely implicated, sloughing of the skin and areolar tissue, with denudation of the bones and destruction of the joints, may occiu’. The disease in all its forms, is most dangerous at either of the extremes of life. If the con- stitution be sound, very extensive mischief may be recovered from ; if, on the other hand, it be depressed or broken by want of the necessaries of life, by fatigue, OA^er-exertion, or indulgence in stimulants, a very slight amomit of disease may prove fatal. The most dangerous compheation of erysipelas, and one which when it exists almost precludes the hope of recovery, is chronic disease of the Mdneys, either in the form of the granular contracted, or of the large Avhite kidney, Avith albuminuria. I have never seen any patient labouring- under these diseases, and attacked Avith traumatic erysipelas, escape Avith life ; the sloughing and suppuration running on unchecked by any treatment that could be adopted. The particular which the erysipelas may assume, and the occiurence of gastro-intestinal or pulmonary complications, will also seriously affect the result. Treatwext.—Preventive Measures.—The occurrence of erysipelas is best guarded against by attention to hygienic measures, more particularly proper ventilation AAuth pine air, and the aA'oidance of OA’ercrowding of patients. In hospitals, erysipelas might be produced at any time by want of attention in these respects, and the frequency of its occurrence may most materially be lessened by careful regulation of the hygienic conditions that sun’ound the patient. Mith every cai'e, however, erysij)elas can neA’er be completely eradi- cated from singical wards, as it is often ejiidemic, brought into the hospital from AA'ithout, and in many cases the conditions that lead to its develojDment have influenced the patients so deeply before their admission into hospital, that no subsequent attention can prevent its occm-rence afterAvards. It often hap- pens that erysipelas is unusually fr-equent in certain Avards and even in certain beds. Its persistence in these respects Avill be found to be owing to some local eause, such as the emanations from a drain or dust-bin, on the removal of Avhich the disease AA’ill cease. kScrupulous attention to cleanliness also on the part of nm-ses and dressers should be enforced, and the latter should not be allcAAnd to go straight from the dead-house to the Avard Avithout previously AAnshiiig their hands in some disinfectant or antiseptic solution. When erysipelas has aheady occurred, its further spread may be prevented by isolating the affected patients, an at once taking active measures to purify the Avard from Avhich they have been removed. iicuo dhe Curative Treatment of erysipelas must always be conducted with698 ERYSIPELAS. Tcfcrcnco to the low character of the local inflannnatioii, its tendency to run into suppuration and gangrene, the asthenic type that the constitutional fever readily assumes, and the frequent complication of visceral inflammations of a congesth’o fonn. The apparent intensity of the local inflammation must not lead the Surgeon into the fatal eiTor of employing an over-active antiphlogistic treatment, more particularly if the disease be epidemic, when it always assumes a low type. It is especially important to look to the future, and to remember that, if active depletory measures be employed early with a view of lessening the present disease, it will be at the risk of inducing more extensive sloughing, and perhaps of lowering the patient’s powers to such a degree as to prevent his bearing np under the depressing influeirce of the ulterior consequences of the disease. Treatment of Cntaneons or Simple Erysipelas.—The treatment required is essentially of a tonic and stimulating character. The principal medicinal remedies consist of bark, quinine, iron, and ammonia. If there be much thirst, these remedies may be given in an effervescent form. But in any case they should be administered in frequent doses. In many of the low forms of erysipelas, medicines are not well borne, the stomach rejecting them ; and then I have seen the best possible results follow the free administration of the brandy-and-egg mixtime, to which I am in the habit of trusting in the majority of these cases. During the progress of the disease, simple pmgatives must be given from time to time. In aucemic and cachectic individuals no remedy exercises so beneficial an influence as the tinctine of perchloride of non, administered in doses of twenty minims every third or fourth horn. The Local Treatment of this, as of every variety of erysipelas, is of equal import- ance with the constitutional management. In slight cases the part should be covered with floin or starch powder dusted ov’er it. In the more severe forms warm applications assiduously continued, especially poppy and chamomile fomen- tations apphed by means of flannels or spongio-piline, afford the greatest possible relief. Cold lotions should never under any circumstances be employed ; they not only lessen the vitality of the part, and thus favoin local sloughing, birt they may chance to cause a retrocession of the disease, and the consequent affection of some internal organ. The local abstraction of blood and of sennn from the iiiflamed part, by the plan introduced by Sir R. Dobson, of rapidly making with the point of a lancet a large number of small pimctmes, from a quarter to half an inch deep, is of much value, by lessening the tension and swelling, and con- sequently diminishing the inflammatory action ; a hot fomentation cloth or a poultice should be laid over the punctures so as to encom-age bleeding, aiid tlie escape of serum. Astringent applications to the inflamed sinface, such as a strong solution of the nitrate of silver, are recommended by some Surgeons, have seen them rather extensively employed in former years, but not witff any very marked success.

In the early stage, our object is to i)revent the inflammation from running into gangi-eue of the affected tissue. The fever being at this iDeriod commonly sthenic, the more active administra- tion of purgati’^'es, antimonials, or effervescent salines is required. I have never seen a case in which blood-letting was required; and depressing remedies, such as salines, should be giA'en vith great caution. Medicinal tonics and dietetic stimulants require to be given early and late. As the disease advances, and symptoms of more or less depression come on, it may be neces- sary to effect that gradual change to a more stimulating plan of treatment, which has already been described in speaking of the management of inflam- matory fever. In doing this, the pulse and the tongue must be our guides ; as the one becomes feebler and the other browner, so must ammonia, bark, and especially port wine, and the brandy-and-egg mixture, be administered. In the more ad’^'anced stages of the disease, when sloughing and suppimation are fully established, oiu’ sole object must be by nourishing diet, and the use of stimidants and tonics, more particularly the tinctime of perchloride of hon, to bear* the patient through the depression and subsequent hectic. The Local Treatment of cellulo-cutaneous or phlegmonous erysipelas must be conducted on essentially the same plan as that of the cutaneous variety, though with more active means. The part affected must be kept at rest, must be elevated if it be a limb, and ha‘\'e hot chamomile and poppy fomentations assiduously applied, cold being more prejudicial here even than in the form of the disease last described ; in this way, the SAvelling and tension may perhaps be removed, and the sloughing of the areolar tissue prevented. In the majority of cases, however, other means will be required to effect this, and with this view none are more efficacious than incisions made into the part; by these an outlet is afforded for the blood and effused serum, Avhich, by distending the vessels and cells of the part, produce strangulation of the tissues and conse- quent sloughing. This mode of practice, originally introduced by Mr. C. Hutchinson, is generally allowed to be the most effectual means Ave possess for ])revention of sloughing ; hence the incisions should be made early, before there has been time for the tissues to lose their vitality. So soon, indeed, as they have become bravmy, indurated, and tense, incisions properly made and placed AviU afford the greatest possible relief to the part and the patient, taking- down the tension by the gaping, and the swelling by the exit they afford to blood and serum. Much difference of opinion has existed among Surgeons, as to the extent to Avhich incisions should be practised in these cases; some recommending that one long cut should be made through the inflamed struc- tmes ; others contending, on the contrary, that a number of small incisions cttei a,nsAver che proposed end. The objections to the long incision are, that so considerable a Avound not only inflicts a serious shock to the system, but that the loss of blood from it may be so groat as to be fatal—cases haAing occuiTed m which life has been lost from this cause, or the hmmorrhage has ligature of the main artery of the limb ; and also ofTmnlW I’clicve tension so effectually as a number extent preventive incisions consequently should be of limited two to three inches 111 length .- at most they should not extendERYSIPELAS. 700 deeper than into the gelatinous-lookine; subcutaneous areolar tissue, unless it happen that the disease have extended beneath the fascia, when they may also be carried through it. South recommends that the incisions should be so 1 arranged in fom’s, as to enclose a diamond-shaped space, and states I I that in this Avay the greatest relief is giA-en to the tension of the I p.art. After the incisions have been made, the part should be avcU poulticed and fomented, so as to facilitate the escape of serum. As it is not the object of the Surgeon to draAV Ijlood in these cases, any undue amount of htemoiThage should be aiTested by plugging the Avoimd. Much blood may be saved by elevating the limb and applying a toimniquet before using the knife, but it is better not to employ Esmarch’s bandage, for fear of driAung the un- healthy inflammatory products into the circulation. In those cases in AA'hich • the disease is not already complicated AAdth an open Abound and decomposing discharges, great adAvantage Avill be derived from the employment of Lister’s antiseptic di’essing, thus preventing the decomposition of the effused inflam- matory fluids Avhich fill up the areolar tissue exposed by the incisions. Before making the incisions, the hmb should be AveU fomented for a quarter of an hour Avith cloths Avetted Avith a hot solution of carbolic acid (1 to 40). The toiu’- niquet is then applied, and the incisions made under a spray of carbolic acid. To arrest excessive bleeding, the Avoiuids must be plugged Avith carbolic acid gauze. The treatment is then conducted according to the rules laid doAvn Avheii describing the antiseptic method. If the necessaries for Lister’s dressing be not at hand, the part may be AATapped in hot oakum poultices, or dressed AAuth some other disinfectant application. After suppimation and sloughing have taken place, as indicated by a boggy feel of the parts, free incision should be made in order to let out pus and sloughs. After this, the skin aauII often be found to be greatly undermined, Iffue, and thin, AAuth matter bagging in the more dependent parts ; if so, egress must be made for it by free counter- openings, and di’ainage-tubes inserted as required. During the after-treatment, frequent dressing is necessary to prevent an accumulation of pus, and the sloughs must be removed as they form. Care should be taken not to destroy any of the A^ascidar connections of .the sldn Avith subjacent parts; but, in order to get proper cicatrisation, it AAill often be found necessary to lay open sinuses, or to divide bridges of unhealthy and blue integument stretching across chasms left by the remoA'al of the gangrenous areolar tissue. If the loss , of substance be great, the cicatrix that forms may be Aveak, imperfect, or so contracted as to occasion gTeat defoimity of the limb. In othc]- cases, again, the diseased state of the bones and joints may be such as to caU for ultimate amputation, either in consequence of the local deformity and announce, or in order to free the constitution from a source of hectic and of imtation. In aU circumstances, the patient’s health AviU usually continue in a feeble and shattered state for a considerable time after recovery fr’om this form of erysipelas, requiring change of air and great attention to habits of life, a nourishing diet, &c. . , In the Treatment of Cellular Erysipelas it is usually necessaij to administer stimulants early ; ammonia, Avine, or brandy may be required from the very first. The Siugeon must judge of this by the constitutional condifron of the patient, and more particularly by the state of his pulse and tongue. TheERYSIPELAS OF THE HEAD. 701 Local Treatment is precisely of the same kiiul as that adopted in phlegmonous erysipelas, exeept that the ineisions require to be made eaidier and perhaps more freely ; in all other respects, there is no difference between the general management of the two forms of the disease. Special Forms of External Erysipelas.—Erysipelas of Newly bom Infants is occasionally met with, more particularly in lying-in hospitals, or in situations where the mother and child are exposed to depressing causes of disease. It usually appears a few days after the birth, at first about the abdomen and genitals, and soon spreads over the whole of the body, being- characterised by a dusky redness, which rapidly runs into gangrene of the affected tissues. It has been supposed to arise from inflammation of the mnbilical vein, or of the umbilicus itself. It is extremely fatal, mnng to the feeble vitality of the child, and ptresents but few points for treatment; change of air and of nursing, Avith the administration of a feiv di-ops of spirits of ammonia or brandy from time to time, being aU that can be done. Erysipelas of the Orbit may occur primarily, or as the result of extension of the disease from the neighbouring structiu-es. It is dangerous, and often fatal from encephalitis. It commences Avith a violent deep-seated pain at the base of the orbit ; the conjunctiva becomes injected and ecchymosed, the eye- lids are gpeatly sAvollen, red, and oedematous ; the eyeball protrudes, and vision is impaired or altogether lost. Symptoms of cerebral inflammation now set in, and the patient becomes dehrious and often sinks comatose. The Treatment consists in fomentations, with early and free incisions into the orbit, made by pushing a lancet flat-Avise between the eyeball and the orbital walls, through the inflamed conjunctiva, the eyelids having prcAdously been everted. In this way inflammatory effusions and pus may be evacuated. Destructive abscesses of the orbit, possibly of an erysipelatous origin, occa- sionally occur in the puerperal state, requiring, when practicable, the fr-ee evacuation of the pus, in the way just mentioned. Phlegmonous Erysipelas of the Head is of very fr-equent occurrence from slight injimies or operations about the scalp and face, more particularly in elderly people and those of unhealthy constitution. In this form of erysipelas there are two special sources of danger ; one is sloughing of the occipito- frontalis muscle, the other, inflammation of the membranes of the brain. The occipito-frontalis muscle rarely sloughs, except in cases of traumatic erysipelas of the head. It then loses its vitality in consequence of the sup- pm-ation of the deep plane of areolar tissue lying betAA^een it and the cranium, and encephalitis occurs apparently by the extension of the inflammation inwards. The Prognosis of erysipelas of the head Avill often greatly depend upon its origin—Avhether traumatic or idiopathic. When arising fr-om Avound, it is very commonly fatal; Avhen it is idiopathic, it is very seldom indeed foUoAved by death. This difference in the termination of the tAvo varieties of the disease is OAving, I believe, to the great tendency to suppm-ation and deep slouo-hiuo- of the scalp in cases of Avound, and the infrequency of this occuiTence when there is no breach of surface. In the Treatment of this affection, active means are more fr-eqiiently required than in the management of other forms of erysipelas. But in very many.702 EliYSIPELAS. purliaps [ may say in most instances, the disease is associated ’nhth more or less asthenia, and then the tonic and stimulating plan of treatment is attended by the best results. AVith the view of preventing sloughing of the muscles, a free crucial incision should be made through the scalp down to the bone ; the head, of course, having been shaved at the onset of the disease. Bagging of matter must be prevented by free counter-openings, and the application of pads and bandages, wherever it is likely to occur. However much the scalp may be undermined, or the bones of the cranium exposed, adhesion usually takes place, and the Autality of the parts is preserved. Phlegmonous Erysipelas of the Lips and Side of the Face and Neck, of a peculiarly fatal character, occasionally occurs in young people otherwise apparently healthy. It begins with a pimple, bleb, or vesicle on the lips or nose. This is occasionally attributed to the sting of some insect, or possibly to inoculation from a carrion-fly. It is hot, painful, and itching ; from this, as from a focus of mischief, the disease spreads rapidly, usually involving one side of the face only. The parts become brawny, red, and pm-- plish, greatly swollen, and painful. The constitutional disturbance is very great. Irritative fever, rapidly assuming a low form, sets in ; and death com- monly results in from forty-eight hours to six days, recovery rarely occurring. This disease has some resemblance to malignant pustule, but never runs into snppiu’ation or slongh. Hence I do not think that it can justly be considered a carbuncular inflammation of the face, under which term it has been described. Its whole coiu’se and the appearance of the inflamed part rather indicates its erysipelatous nature. Heath usually ensues in fr’om forty-eight horns to five or at most six days after invasion. The fatal result is preceded by rigors, and is evidently due to blood-poisoning of a rapid and aggi’avated character. The infection of the blood takes place through the large venous anastomoses of the side of the face, which are peculiarly patent, ocem-ring in the dense areolar and fibro-cellular strnctiu-es in which they ramify. Treatment has little effect m staying the progTess of this terrible malady. Dietetic stimiflants,^ strong sup- port, and tonics are indicated. Free incisions might be of service, but the situation affected prevents the possibility of their emidoyment. Diffuse Cellulitis of the SuhmaxiUary Region has been specially described by Bickersteth. After the exposure to heat and cold, gi-eat niflam- matoiT swelling rapidly sets in at the forepart of the neck and imder the angle of the jaw • these parts liecome diffusedly brawny ; unless relief be afforded, death will rapidly ensue -from suffocation, the disease spreading to the root of the epiglottis, and producing oedema glottidis. _ _ _ ThQ^Treatment consists in making a fi-ee incision in the mesial hue, ’on tho chin to the os hpidcs, through the infiltrated pai'ts from which a thin dmk senim, but no pus, will be seen to exude. The mcision luiist be oan-ied to a depth if two inches or more towards the base of the tongue, keeping eai-c- MlVto tte middle hue, until the whole of the bra,my infiltration has been Elytipelas of the Scrotum, the “ inflammatory todemn.” so well de*ribed by liton, is of frequent occurrence, as the result of wounds, ulcci-s, and othci Jnrees of irritation in this neighbourhood. The scrotum sivells to a ^ size being uniformly red, but with a semi-transparent glossy appeaiance, pittm„WHITLOW. 703 readily on pressure, and feeling somewhat soft and doughy between the fingers: the integiunents of the penis are also greatly swollen and oedematous, and sometimes the inflammation extends to the areolar tissue of the cord. The chief characteristic of this form of erysipelas is its tendency to run into slough Avithout any prcA’ious brawny or tense condition of the parts ; the dartos becoming so distended Avith sero-plastic fluid that the circulation thi-ough it is arrested, and its tissue loses its vitality. When an incision is made into it in this state it scarcely bleeds, and the sides of the wound present a yellowish- Avhite gelatinous appearance. The Treaiment of erysipelas of the scrotum consists in making a free incision about four inches in length from behind fonvards on each side of the septum, taking care, of course, not to go so deep as to Avound the testes ; the part must then be supported on a pillow, and well poulticed and fomented. If this incision be not made at once, a great part or even the Avhole of the scrotum may slough away, leaA'ing the testes and cord bare ; in these unpleasant circumstances, hoAvever, the parts AviU often Avith great rapidity cover them- selves with a ncAV integument. The oedema of the penis usually subsides of itself, or after making a few punctures in it; should its integuments, how- ever, threaten to slough, a free incision must be made into it, or the prepuce be slit up. Erysipelas of the Pudenda is occasionally met Avith in iU-fed unhealthy children in whom cleanliness is neglected. The parts become of a dusky or hvid red, swell considerably, and quickly run into gangrene, which spreads up the abdomen or doAvn the nates. It may prove fatal by inducing peritonitis or exhaustion. In the Treatment, ammonia, bark, and the chlorate of potash, Avith good noiu’ishment, and a little wine, are the principal means, at the same time that yeast or chlorinated poultices are applied locally. Erysipelatous Inflammation of the Fingers, or, as it is commonly called. Whitlow, is a frequent affection in old and in young people, either occiu’ring spontaneously in cachectic constitutions, or as an accompaniment of renal disease, or arising from the irritation produced by scratches, punctiu’es, or the inoculation of the part with poisonous or putrescent matters. It is most common in the spring of the year, when, indeed, it sometimes appears to be epidemic. That whitloAV is truly an erysipelatous affection of the fingers, appears to be proA ed by the following facts. 1. The causes, whether of season, infection, or local irritation, are the same in both affections. 2. The constitutional dis- turbance in whitloAV is always very severe for a disease apparently so slight, and assirmes the same character of speedy depression that we observe in erysipelas. 3. I he inflammation of the affected finger is inv’ariably diffused, never being bounded by adhesion, but always tending to terminate in suppura- tion and sloughing. 4. So soon as tire disease spreads beyond the affected uger, or to the back of the hand, it assumes a distinctly erysipelatous apnear- ance and character. ^ ^ r n ai The inflammation of Avhitlow is in many cases confined to the pulp of the this, and often quentlyAuthout any recognisable traumatic cause. The part become704 ERYSIPELAS. extremely painful, hard, reel, and s-wollen ; it then suppiu’ates to a limited extent, with some sloughing of the areolar tissue. In many cases the ungual phalanx, which is embedded in the cellulo-fibrous pulp, necroses. There is usually some inflammation of the lymphatics of the arm ; and not unfi-ecpiently ti good deal of constitutional fever and irritation is present. In the more severe cases of whitlow, the inflammation, which is of an excessi-s'ely painful character, owing probably to the tension of the parts, extends to the sheaths of the tendons, and then constitutes an affection that is fraught ■with danger to the utility of the finger or hand. The whole finger swells considerably, becomes red and tense, Avith much throbbing and shooting pain ; the infiammation rapidly extends to the back of the hand, which becomes puffy, red, and swollen, presenting the ordinary characters of erysipelas. Although the palm be greatly swollen, it usually preserves its natmul colour, or becomes dull white, owing to the gveater thickness of its cuticle. Pus rapidly forms, both in the finger and hand, and, finding its Avay into the sheaths of the tendons, spreads up the forearm imder the annular ligament. There is usually no fluctuation to be felt in the finger, even though pus may have formed, but in other parts of the hand it may readily be detected in the -usual way. In these cases there is always much sloughing conjoined with the suppuration ; the areolar tissue of the finger and hand, the tendons of their sheaths, and the palmar fascia being all more or less implicated. In some cases the end of the finger, as far as the fii’st phalangeal joint or the middle of the second phalanx, falls into a state of gangrene and has to be separated. In many cases the joints of the fingers are destroyed, and the phalanges necrose ; or, if this do not happen, the tissues of the part may be so matted together, as the result of sloughing and suppuration, that rigid and contracted fino'ers or a stiff and comparatively useless hand, may be permanently left, mitlow affecting the little finger or thumb is much more likely to cause ■suppiuation in the common sheath of the flexor tendons than when it occurs in W of the other fingers. This is due to the fact that the synovial sheaths of the flexor tendons of the thumb and little finger commmucate with the common sheath, while those of the thi-ee other fingers do not. In the Treatment, the patient should be well piuged, and kept upon a stiictly antiphlogistic regimen diuing the early stages. At the same time the inflamed fino-er should be freely leeched, and then alternately poulticed and soaked in veiw hot water, for twenty-four or forty-eight hoius, being _ kept whole of this time in an elevated position. In this way the inflammation y be sometimes cut short at its onset; should it, however, continue to increase the W- becoming hard, AAdih much throbbing, a free longitudinal incision must afonfe be nmde alo^g each side of it, so as to relieve tension and lue- vent slouching ; this procedure should never be omitted, on account of the of the preservation of the full utility of the part. Local aneesthesia of ^the fino-er may be produced by the ether-spray. The incision is best made tm the m xZr the dital end of the finger, so that .f the patieiff outtin? ivill be faeffitated rather than prevented. In .1“ d owned' the sheaths of the tendons should, if possible be avo.d d ; *cy te the tendons will probably slongh, and the ft.ger he left in a pelinanent y• z z 7°5 ERYSIPELAS OF MUCOUS SURFACES. extended and rigid state. The finger must then be well soaked in hot water, and poulticed. In this way the inflammation may be arrested, and sloughing happily avoided ; should, however, matter have formed, it must be let out as it acciimulates. The dead and sodden cuticle should be cut away with scissors, as it frequently seriously interferes with the escape of the discharges and sloughs. After the opening has been made, and any slough which may have fomed has come away, it not unfrequently happens that a large and fungoid gi-anulating mass sprouts up ; this will, however, gradually subside, as the swelling of the finger goes down and the inflammation abates. It the nail become loosened, it had better be removed, as it may otherwise keep up iiTitation ; it must not, however, be torn off if adherent, but merely scraped and cut away so far as it is loose. When the whole of a finger is aft’ected, the hand should be placed on a pasteboard splint as soon as the inflammation has been somewhat subdued, lest contraction of the affected finger ensue, which may eventually extend to the neighbouring ones. In opening a deep seated palmar abscess, there is danger of wounding the branches of the median nerve, the superficial palmar arch, and the digital arteries. These structures may all be avoided, and the operation done safely, by making the incision towards the head of a metacarpal bone, upon the bone itself and parallel to its axis, so as to avoid the digital interspaces. When the joints are implicated, destruction of the cartilages commonly ensues; yet, by position, and rest on a splint, a tolerably useful though stiffened finger may be retained. When the bones are implicated, some operative pro- cedm’e usually becomes eventually necessary. If the ungual phalanx alone be necrosed, it may be excised through an incision on the palmar side of the finger, the pulp and nail being left; in this way I have often preserved a finger that must otherwise have been removed. Amputation of the finger at the metacaiqio-phalangeal articulation wiU usually be required when the second or proximal phalanges are involved ; though here partial excision, by cutting and scraping away the diseased bone, may sometimes be usefully done. During the later stages of these affections, tonics, good diet, and stimulants will be required for the re-establishment of the health. . INTBBNAL EEYSIPELAS. By Internal Erysipelas we mean those forms of diffuse inflammation which affect the Mucous or Serous Surfaces, or the Lining Membrane of Ai’teries, Veins, and Lymphatics. Erysipelas of Mucous Surfaces.—The mucous tract that is chiefly affected by this disease is that covering the fauces, the pharynx, or the larynx. Erysipelas of the Fauces may occur in consequence of the disease spreading from the head and face to these parts ; or it may commence as a primary affection, occun’ing perhaps at the same time that the rash appears on the cutaneous surface of some distant part of the body. When the fauces are erysipelatous, they present a bright crimson or scarlet colour, with some swelling and thickening of the soft palate and uvula ; the patient also most commonly has some huskiness or complete loss of voice, and occasionally some eroupy symptoms. At the same time there is a good deal of low constitu- VOL. I.7o6 ERYSIPEfAS. tional fever, wifcli a pungent hot skin ami quick pulse. This form of erysipelas is peculiarly contagious, and occurs not uufrequently in the attendants of those who are labouring under some of the other varieties of the disease ; of this I have seen numerous instances. In many cases, also, it is epidemic, spreading through a house and affecting almost every inmate. Treatment.—The best results arc obtained by sponging the inflamed parts freely with a strong solution of the nitrate of silver; and, if there be much constitutional depression, by administering full doses of ammonia, with cam- phor or bark. Should the disease go on to sloughing, constituting one of the forms of “ putrid sore thi-oat ” (which not unfrequently happens), the mineral acids and bark, vdth chlorinated gargles, and the brandy-and-egg mixture for support, will be found most useful. In many cases, this disease continues limited to the palate and fauces ; but in others it extends upwards or downwards. It may extend upwards tlirough the nares, out of the nostrils, and thus spread over the face and head. It may extend downwards, affecting the gastro-intestinal membrane, or, more frequently, implicatmg the larynx. Erysipelatous Laryngitis, as described by Eyland, Budd, and others, is extremely dangerous. The inflammation, commencing in the fauces, rapidly spreads to the mucous membrane and loose submucous areolar tissue external to and within the larynx, giving rise to extensive cedematous infiltration with sero-plastic fluid, which, by obstructing the rima glottidis, may readily suffo- cate the patient. In consequence of this special tendency to cedema, the disease has by many writers been termed “ mclematous laryngitis:’ After death, the submucous areolar tissue of the fauces, that about the base of the epiglottis, and especially that which enters into the aryt^no-epiglottidean folds and that covering the posterior part of the larynx, Avill be found to be dis- tended with serum or a sero-puriform fluid. This infiltration reaches to the rima of the glottis, and, extending into the interior of the larynx, gives rise to such swelhng that its cavity is nearly obliterated. Great as the swelling may be however, in all these parts, it never spreads below the true vocal chords. This fact, which is very important, is explained by the mucous membrane coming closely into contact with, and being adherent to, the fibrous tissue of which these structures are composed, without the intervention of any sub- mucous areolar tissue. The progress of this cedematous inflammation of the , mucous membrane and loose submucous tissue in these situations is often amazingly rapid, the swelhng being sufficient to induce suffocation at the end of thirty-six or forty-eight hours, or even sooner. If the patient be not carried off in this way, there will be a great tendency to suppuration and sloughing of the affected tissues, leading perhaps eventually to death from abso°T)tion of pus and low constitutional fever. The Symptoms of this affection are strongly marked. The patient a^r _ being attaeked with erysil»las of the fauces, attended by seme d.fflcuhy pain ill deglutition, and huskiness of the voice, is seized ivith more oi 1^ difficulty in breathing, coughs hoarsely and with a croupy s^nd. and co plains of tenderness under the angles of the diffieoltyin breathing increases, and may speedily natient giving rise to intense fits of dyspnoea, m one ol which he mil probably Cndiily eflTied off. The dfflcnlty is greater in inspiration than o. p i707 EliYSIFELAS OF SEROUS MEMBRANES. z z 2 ration as the swollen parts above the opemng of the larynx fall together like a valve in the fonner act, while they are easily separated by air coming fi’om below in the latter. On examining the throat the fauces will not only be obsen'od to be much and duskily reddened, but by depressing the tongue the epiglottis can be felt, and perhaps seen, to be rigid and erect. Examination with the laryngoscope readily shows the condition of the parts to be as above described. Enlarged lymphatic glands can usually be felt early in the case behind the angle of the lower jaw. In the Treatment, local means are of the first importance. The tongue having been well depressed, the posterior part of the larynx, the epiglottis, and the aryta3no-epiglottideau folds must be well scarified by means of a hernia- knife, with which this operation may be most readily and safely done. If no better instrument be at hand in case of emergency, a very useful amount of scarification may be done by the nail of the Surgeon’s index-finger, notched with a knife to make it tear the mucous membrane more readily. The patient should then be directed to inhale the steam of hot water, and a large number of leeches may be applied under each angle of the jaw, to be followed by large and hot poultices; at the sanie time, the bowels must be kept weU opened, and the patient treated by antiphlogistic measures or otherwise, according to the condition of the constitutional fever. Most frequently, I have found anti- monials of great service in the early stages, followed later by support and stimulants. A few hours after the engorged tissues have been unloaded by scarification, the fauces, pharynx, and upper part of the larynx should be well sponged out with a strong solution of the nitrate of silver (sixty gTains to an ounce) which must be applied freely, coagulating the mucus, and taking domi the increased vascular action. If notwithstanding the employment of these measures, the dyspnoea increase, the face becoming pale, M^dd, and bedewed with a clammy perspiration, it will be necessary to open the windpipe to save the patient from impending suffocation. In doing this I prefer laryngotomy, for reasons that will be mentioned when I come to speak of the Diseases of and Operations on the Air-passages. In order, however, that this operation may be successful, it must not be too long delayed, and should not be looked upon as a last resource; if it be done in time (and time in these cases is most precious, owing to the rapid progress of the disease), the patient’s life may probably be saved ; but if it be deferred too long, congestion of the lungs wifi come on, the blood will cease to be properly arterialised, and the patient wll sink from slow-asphyxia, even though air bo at last freely admitted. If the patient survive to the stage of sloughing, chlorinated gargles, bark and support must be our chief reliance. ^ Erysipelas of the Serous Membranes is of common occurrence in sur- l^al practice, being frequently met with in the arachnoid and peritoneum. - ncse, like all other serous morabranes, are liable to two distinct forms of inflammation , one, which is sthenic, having a tendency to the formation of p as 1C ymph ; the other,^ which is diffuse or erysipelatous, being always accompanied by the exudation of aplastic unorganisablc material. of^nTrics^ofAraclmitis coumionly occurs as a consequence injuncs of the head and erysipelas of the scalp.

On examination after death, the ^ arachnoid and pia mater are found gi'eatly injected wth blood, forming a close red net-work of vessels over the surface of the brain ; the substance of which is usually somewhat injected, the ventricles being distended with a reddish- coloured serum. If examined at a later period in the disease than this, the inflamed arachnoid is found to be covered with a layer of opaque puriform lymph, of a greenish-yellow coloiu’ and slimy consistence. Erysipelatous or Diffuse Peritonitis is not unfrequently met with in aged and cachectic subjects after the operation for hernia, or as a consequence of various diseases and injm-ies of the pelvic or abdominal organs. The symptoms are often of a latent character, the disease being chiefly indicated by obscure pain diffused over the abdomen with tenderness on pressure, an anxious depressed countenance, and a small and rather hard pulse. There may be heat of skin ; but it is a peculiar feature of this form of the disease that the patient may die without any elevation of the temperature of the body. On examination after death, the subperitoneal areolar tissue is found injected, the peritoneum opaque in parts, covered Avith fihny patches of greyish lymph, and usually containing a largish quantity of opaque dirty-looking tiubid fluid, mixed with shreds and floccuh of lymph. This, though closely resembhng pus in appearance, is serum with lymph intermixed, and is pecu- liarly acid, acrid, and irritating. It is this form of peritonitis that is especially dangerous to dissectors ; inoculation of the fingers with any of this fluid being often productive of the most serious and even fatal con- sequences. Erysipelatous Inflammation of the Lining Membranes of the Vascular System Avill be discussed when we come to consider diseases of these parts.CAUSES OF PY.EMIA. CHAPTER XXXIII. PYAEMIA. The term Pyaemia is applied to a group of pathological phenomena, which, arising in somewhat similar conditions, and running for the most part similar courses, were until recently considered to constitute a single well-defined attection dependent, as was supposed, upon the admixture of pus with the blood ; hence the name given to it. This disease (for it will be found con- venient, though not strictly correct, to look upon the members of this group as constituting but one aftection) is closely allied in cause and in character to some of the lowest and worst forms of erysipelas and diffuse infiammation, with which indeed it is frequently associated, and to which it presents great similarity in its causes, symptoms, and effects. Causes.*—Like erysipelas, pyaemia commonly occms at those seasons of the year, and under those atmospheric conditions, in which diseases of a low type are prevalent. There is no more common or certain cause of its production than the overcrowding of patients suffering from suppurating wounds in hos- pitals ; and it is in unhealthy and cachectic constitutions that it usually manifests itself. It is more common in adults and elderly people than in children ; but, though it is least frequently met with during the earher periods of fife, it may make its appearance at any age. Very young children and even infants may be attacked by it. Pycemia is a very common cause of death after operations and severe injuries, especially in hospitals that are situated in large towns, or that, however well situated, are overcroAvded. It is disposed to by all conditions of hfe, either before or after operations or injuries, that tend to impair the health, to lower the strength, and to induce an mihealthy state of the blood, such as constant want of fresh air, overcrowding in working or in sleeping apartments, and insufficient or inqjroper nourishment. Of all these causes, overcrowding is undoubtedly the most frequent and the most fatal; more particularly is over- crowding of patients injurious, if there be many suppurating wounds under the same loof. That pymmia is the result of the faulty hygienic conditions just a hided to, viz., AA'ant of pure air, overcrowding, and insufficient and unwhole- some diet, is evident from the fact of its being rife and most destructive where those causes of disease prevail, as amongst the poorer classes of all large and t ensely peopled tovuis ; while in the pm-er air of country districts, or in pmate practice amongst the wealthier classes, it is rarely met with. It is one 0 t ose causes of death after operations that might and ought to be prevented; anc w erever it is frequent, we may be sure either that the constitutions of tne patient are peculiarly deteriorated, or else that the hygienic conditions to See also aiaptcrs I. and II., and “ Ilosi.ttnli.sm and the Causes of Death after Oiieration.” Longmans, 1874.PYyEMIA. 710 which they are exposed after the injury or operation arc ])eculiarly faulty. Tliat it may be prevented, has been abundantly proved by the experience gained in the Franco-German war of 1870. In that great struggle, the fact, which had been previously well known to all scientific Surgeons, was esta- blished beyond all possibility of cavil, that the danger of pyasmia increased, ccvtcris 2^ctribiis, in proportion as wounded patients were closely crowded, so that the atmosphere surrounding them became contaminated by morbid exha- lations from suppm-ating wounds. It was found in numerous instances that, among the great mass of the wounded, pyaemia Avas developed among those Avho were aggregated within the walls of hospitals or regular buildings, such as chiu’ches, barns, school-houses, and conservatories, which, though clean and airy, did not admit of thorough ventilation; while it was almost, if not entirely, unknown among soldiers of exactly the same class who Avere treated for their wounds in hastily constructed open and draughty huts. Indeed, there is no fact better established in surgery, than that pyEemia is the invariable result of the aggregation of the wounded, and that its develo]Dment may be prevented at any time by reference to the cubic space allotted to each patient. As this is diminished, so the disease increases ; and this, coiteri^ paribus, in an exact ratio. Pyaemia is rarely, if ever, idiopathic or primary, but occiu's as the conse- quence of preAdous inflammation of some part of the body. This inflammation may be idiopathic or the result of some Avound or injury, and in most cases it has reached the stage of suppuration before the pyaemic symptoms come on. Cases, however, have been met Avith presenting all the post mortem appeai’ances of pyaemia, in which no local source of infection could be discovered after the most careful search. These are very rare, and do not prove that pyaemia can ocem.' idiopathicaUy ; for, however careful a search may have been made, it is quite possible that the source of the disease was overlooked. Pyemia fre- quiently appears in connection Avith some low form of specific suppurative inflammation. Thus we see boils, carbuncles, diffused abscess, erysipelas of the skin, or erysipelatous inflammation of the veins or absorbents, precede and lead to its occurrence. In the vast majority of cases of pyaemia coming under the observation of the Siu’geon, the disease arises in connection Avith decomposing discharges from a wound. That is to say, at the time when the first rigor attacks the patient, the wound Avill be found to be yielding dischaige having the odour of decomposition more or less distinctly perceptible. This fact, and the results of pathological experiments on animals, have led many Surgeons to beheve that the absorption of putrid matter from a wound and its introduction into the system by means of the veins in the form of decomposing clots, is sufficient to give rise to all the symptoms of pyajmia, and that by the absolute prevention of decomposition in Avounds we may greatly dimimsb, 111 fact, almost abohsh this disease. The influence of decomposition as a cause ot pytemia has been denied, because cases midoubtedly occur m which no decom- position is present at the source of infection.

Wounds of veins, of bones, and of joints, are the injuries that are especially apt to be followed by this disease ; and in the puerperal state it is often met with, probably as the result of uterine phlebitis. Phexomena.—Pyamiia is characterised especially by two series of pheno- mena : 1. A peculiar train of Constitutional Symptoms attended by a state ot <n-cat depression of the powers of the system ; ih The formation of Absces^ses, and the occurrence of diffuse inflammation in various parts of the body. The disease may be acute, subacute, or chronic. Most usuaUy it is subacute, and often chronic. Whatever form it may assume, the symptoms are essentially the same, differing only in degree. I. Symptoms.—The characteristic symptoms of pymmia consist of a sudden and severe rigor, preceded by a great rise in the temperatine ot the body, and followed by profuse and exhausting sweating. The invasion of the disease is as follows. During the period of an appa- rently ordinary febrile disturbance, the patient is seized with a rigor, usually very severe and prolonged. This is accompanied by a great rise in the tem- peratiue of the body, and is followed by profuse sweating, during which the temperature falls. The temperatm-e again rises even as high as 107° Fahr. The accompanying Diagrams (Figs. 2G8, 269), for which I am indebted to Dr. Ringer, who took them from patients of mine, vdll indicate this more clearly than any description. A single rigor only may occur, and the disease pass off. But more fre- quently the rigors are repeated at intervals of from 24 to 48 horns ; and, as the disease becomes established, they may reciu’ twice or oftener in the 24 hours. The temperature in pyaemia presents remarkable and characteristic fluctua- tions. It is iinitbrmly higher than normal, but rises above and falls in its general level in exact accordance vdth the development of the rigors. Wim- derhch observes that the rise of temperatiu’e in the first accession of pymmic fever is greater in a shorter time than in any other disease, and that the fall is equally rapid with the rise, and sometimes more so. But it does not, as a rule, reach the normal point, and usually ascends again long before this is reached. In some cases, however, the temperatine falls slightly below normal dining the profuse sweating following a rigor, as shown in the accompanying temperatme charts. Dr. Ringer, who has paid great attention to this subject, believes that the rise in the temperature precedes the occurrence of the rigors ; and he has been able to predict the approach of a rigor by noting a commencing rise in the thermometer. It is a remarkable circumstance that this actual and great increase in the temperature of the body should co-exist with a sensation of cold ; and there are sometimes actually two rigors during one continuous rise of temperature. As the rigor subsides the patient breaks into a sweat—first about the face and head, and then over the body. The sweats are usually very profuse, the bedclothes being soaked with perspiration. They are very exhausting to the patient. As soon as sweating comes on, the temperature begins to fall, and continues to decline until it reaches the uniform level, perhaps sinking in the earlier n'gors to the normal level or even below it. This low temperature, "uhen it occurs, is of very brief duration.PYjEMIA. 712 The lioat, rigor, and sweating, increasing at j^retty regular intervals, cause an invasion of pya3inia closely to resemble that of an ague fit. And, indeed, there would appear to ho a close analogy between the two diseases ; for, as ague is the result of blood-poisoning from exposure to malarial influences and oo (M bb s Slight Uigor Severe Rigor.

Any open Avoimd that may exist at this time usually becomes foul and. sloughy, and ceases to secrete healtliy pus ; but this is by no means necessarily the "case, for it may continue healthily granulating throughout the disease.

The secretions are arrested ; the pulse is quick and soft ; the face is usually pale, with a very anxious drawn look, but sometimes flushed, and the eyes bright; there are hebetude and dulness of mind, vflth slight nocturnal delirium, but perfect consciousness on being spoken to. Eapid wasting of the body sets in about this period ; patches of erratic erythema frequently make their appearance on the surface ; and the skin assumes a dull sallow and earthy, or a ^bright yellow icteric tint, which may extend e-\’en to the con- .lunctivEE. The symptoms now indicate an extreme depression of the vital powers ; the pulse becoming small and fluttering, the tongue, Avhich has been dry, becoming brown, sordcs being deposited about the teeth, and low delirium supen-enmg. Usually from the sixth to the tenth day, but sometimes earlier.714 PYjEMIA. suppuration commences in different tissues, joints, and organs. Abscess may form in the lungs or pleura) without cough or pain ; if in the areolar tissue, or in the substance of muscles, there is usually doughy swelling, with some red- ness ; it in the joints, the swelling is often considerable, the pain usually intense and very superficial and cutaneous, the patient screaming aloud with the agony. These pains, which are chiefly seated in the knees, ankles, hips, and shoulders, often simulate rheumatism very closely, and have been mis- taken for that disease. The progress of the disease is usually from bad to worse, sometimes rapidly, but at other times not uninterruptedly so, there being remissions and apparent, though not real, improvement. The patient rapidly wastes, the body becoming shninken, the muscles soft, and the skin grey or sallow, loose and pendulous ; great debUity also sets in. The abdomen becomes tympanitic, diarrhoea or profuse sweats come on ; pneumonia or pleuritic effusions declare themselves ; delirium, from which the patient is easily roused, alternates with sopor ; and at last he sinks from exhaustion. Death usually takes place about the tenth or twelfth day ; though it may occin as early as the fourth, or the patient may linger on for six or seven weeks. In other cases pyrnmia occurs in a very insidious manner, either without any rigor or with one so slight as hardly to be noticed. Occasionally the rigor may be more distinct, but in this variety of the affection it is never repeated dining the coinse of the disease. It seems, in fact, little more than an exaggeration of the pre-existing surgical fever. The temperature remains high, shoving, perhaps, shght fluctuations, but never presenting the extreme variations seen in ordinary pyaemia. There are complete loss of appetite and rapid wasting ; occasionally diarrhoea is present, and more rarely vomiting. The tongue is extremely dry and furred, so as to render the patient’s speech thick and unintelligible. After a time the skin assumes a yellowish thit, as do the conjunctive. This colour is not due to true jaundice, but rather to an alteration in the blood, in consequence of which the red corpuscles break up dining life, thus staining all the tissues of the body with their pigment. In acute cases, after fr’om three to six days, the temperature falls,- the pulse becomes more and more feeble, and the patient sinks into a semi-comatose state, in which he dies. If life be prolonged for a longer time, symptoms of low pneumonia orpleinisy, and, perhaps, pericarditis set in; abscesses may form in some of the joints, or in the seat of recent injuries or points of pressine, as over the backs of the arms, shoulders, or sacrum ; and the patient gradually emaciates and dies exhausted. In these more chronic cases, the staining of the skin is not noticed. Many writers describe the above conditions luider the name of septiciemia, and would distinguish it fr’om pya)mia as a distinctly separate, although nearly allied, condition, resening the name pyiemia foi those cases in which metastatic abscesses distinctly referable to emboUsm are to be found. No doubt many cases are seen presenting every possible stage between the most typical specimens of the tw'O varieties, and this has been use as an argument in favoin of their identity ; but it might also be explained by supposing that the two conditions may exist at one time mingled with each other in varying proportions. _ j . . 2. The Formation of nnmerons Purulent Deposits, “ sccondaiy or715 PURULENT DEPOSITS. metastatic abscesses,” as they arc often termed, is the most marked feature of pyiemia. The suppurations usually contain a somewhat thin and oily-looking pus ; sometimes, however, it is thick and laudable. The more oily-looking thud, though opaque and yellow, and closely resembling true pus, will, on jiiicroscopic examination, bo found to difter from this in the absence of the true nucleated pus-corpuscles, though it contains an immense numljer of granular cells (Fig. 12). After removal it often forms a firm fibrinous coagulum. These purulent collections vary greatly in size and in situation. They are found in foiu- localities, ^'iz., in the viscera, in the areolar and muscular struc- tures, in the serous membranes, and in the joints. They are most frequently met with in the lungs and pleime, usually in one pleural sac only ; then in the joints : next in the intermuscular areolar planes. Pyrnmic abscesses differ from ordinary piu’ulent collections, not only in the pecuhar character of the pus that they contain, but more particularly in the rapidity wuth which they form, a few days commonly sufficing for them to attain a large size. This, mth their very widely spread character, and the insidious manner in which they occur, often with few if any local signs—the tissues, as it were, breaking down without any inflammation—constitute the distinguishing features of these collections. • The visceral abscesses vary in size fi'om a pin’s head to a walnut; in many cases the organs affected are studded vdth them. These collections are most frequently met with in the limgs, being seated at the posterior part and on the surface of these organs, or in the interlobular fissures ; they are usually sur- rounded by a darkly inflamed and condensed layer of pulmonary tissue, and sometimes a zone of pulmonary apoplexy can be recognised immediately in contact with the puriform fluid. Not unfrequently they are seated in the midst of a large patch of lung in a state of low or congestive pneumonia, or the whole of the posterior part of the lung may be in this condition studded with small pytemic abscesses. The organ that is most frequently affected next to the hmg is the liver. Here, also, the abscesses are usually small, numerous, and suiTouuded by an inflamed or congested areola of hepatic substance. In some cases, however, hepatic pymmic abscess is single and of considerable size, perhaps as large as an orange. I have seen purulent collections in the spleen; but they are rare here, in comparison to the organs just named. They may occur in other organs ; as in the prostate, testes, and brain. When the pus is infiltrated into the areolar tissue and muscles of the limbs and trunk, it forms immense diffuse collections of a thin serous matter, com- monly mixed with shreds of the areolar membrane of the part, having no boundary of limiting fibrine. These collections are most ft’equent, perhaps, in the axilla, down the flank and about the back, in the iliac fossa, thigh or calf, and may cither be confined to the subcutaneous, or extend to the deep inter- muscular, areolar planes in these regions ; or they may even form in the muscular substance itself, being diffused between the fasciculi, which are •softened and disintegTated. Most commonly the presence of these collections 13 indicated by patches of cutaneous or erratic erysipelas, and by a douo-hy me ematous, and boggy state of the superjacent integuments. tbP deposits of lowly organised lymph in and upon seious and synovial membranes are very common ; the pleura, the arach-PYjEMIA. 7i6 noid, 01 tlie peritoneum may eacli be thus affected. In the pleura especially, these accumulations are frequent, and pyaemic empyema will often occur very suddenly with few, if any, general symptoms or local signs to indicate its piesence. It is then most frequently due to extension from a pyaemic abscess immediately beneath the pleura, or perhaps, to rupture of such an abscess into the pleural cavity. Frequently some of the joints, especially the knees and shoulders, become filled with a thin, yellow, purulent liquid. These arthritic abscesses are usually indicated by intense pain, often cutaneous or superficial, with fluctuation and swelling hi the joint. Often, however, large accumulations of pus form suddenly in joints, without haidng been preceded by pain or any other sigai of mischief ; in these cases the interior of the joint, though filled with pus, remains tolerably healthy, there being no erosion of cartilage or destruction of ligament, but merely some inflammatory injection of the synovial membrane. Not only are the appearances just mentioned commonly met with in cases of death from pymmia, but we find inflammation of the \iscera, more particu- larly of the brain and lungs, and not unfrequently a diffused erysipelatous redness of some membranous sm-face, as of the arachnoid or the gastro-intes- tinal mucous membrane. It must, however, be remembered, that in cases in wNich during life the skin has shown a marked yellowish tint, dark red ;post mortem stainuig, not only of vessels but also of the tissues smTOundiug them, will always be found very soon after death, often even before the body is cold, and this must not be mistaken for the results of inflammatory congestion. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of pyaemia requires to be made :—1, from ordi- nary Surgical Fever, the Inflammatory Fever wNich accompanies wounds and Injui’ies, and Typhoid Fever ; 2, from Ague ; 3, from Eheumatism. 1. The Diagnosis from ordinary Surgical Inflammatory Fever and Typhoid Fever is usually sufficiently easy, the comse of these fevers being unbroken by severe rigors, by sudden fluctuations of temperature, or by sweats. These symptoms, which are characteristic of pyaemia, do not occur in these other forms of febrile disturbance. An ordinary fever may be ushered in by a rigor; but this is seldom so intense as that which marks pyaemia, and certainly does not recur during the attack. The temperatme also in ordinary fevers is uniformly and continuously high. It is not marked by those sudden exacer- bations, followed by equally rapid declines, that are so characteristic of pyaemia. But it must be borne in mind that a pyaemic rigor may occur in the midst of the uniform high temperature of simple inflammatory fever, indicating the develop- ment of the blood-poisoning ; but then the decline is only to and not below the previous high level, and, unless the pyaemia become established, the rigor and rise of temperatme do not reem. 2. From Ague, which is indeed a form of blood-poisoning from vegetable decomposition, the diagnosis would not be easy in the earher stages, it the patient had been exposed to malarial influences as ivell as to the ordinary causes of pyaemia, as in a person injured whilst lii’ing in a swampy countiy. But, in large towns, the general absence of ague and the obvious surgical cause of the pyaemia wall render the diagnosis more easy. In the later stages, t le signs of articular inflammation and suppmation, the secondary a isceial an areolar abscesses, will all tend to clear up the diagnosis.PATHOLOGY OF PYjEMIA. 717 The temperature will also serve as a valuable guide in forming a diagnosis. As before stated, in pytemia it rarely falls to normal, and if by chance it do so. it rapidly rises again to a higher point, while in ague there is a very distinct and prolonged interval of normal temperature between the febrile attacks. If, however, the patient be suffering at the same time from ague and traumatic fever, the temperature mil fail to sink to the normal point and the diagnosis mil be consequently more obscure. 3. From Rheumatism it is easy to make the diagnosis of pytemia, provided the recun-ent rigor and other early symptoms have beeii well and strongly marked. But if these have been somewhat obscure, and if the secondary articular implication be early developed, then it may certainly be difficult to determine the exact disease with which the patient is affected. But, inde- pendently of the recurrent rigor, the great prostration, the early supervention of atonic symptoms, the development of the visceral abscesses, of areolar sup- puration, and of patches of eiTatic erysipelas, will establish the true nature of the disease. Moreover, the temperature of rheumatic fever does not show the extraordinary variations seen in pymmia and the sweating in rheumatism is continuous, and not merely the sequence of a rigor. In pyaemia the tongue is usually dry, and perhaps brorvn, and never presents the creamy white fru characteristic of rheumatism. The smell of the patient is sweet or “ saccha- rine ” in pyaemia, while in rheumatism it is sour, and quite distinctive. PfiOGJrosis.—The prog-uosis in pyaemia is always bad. The disease is dan- gerous to life, to health, and to limb. When active acute pyaemia has fairly set in, recovery rarely, if ever, takes place, the patient usually dying between the fourth and the twelfth days. One or two pyaemic rigors may be recovered from. It is the repetition of these attacks, followed by profuse sweating, and attended by extreme exhaustion, that is so fatal. In fact, the danger and the rapidity of the fatal termination in any given case will, cc&tens paxibus, depend on the rapidity of the recuiTence of the rigors and their severity. M hen the pymmic attack is from the first subacute or chronic, it may be recorered from, usually after j>rolonged illness, the formation of numerous or large abscesses, arid great and continued distiubance of the general health. In these less active and acute forms of pymmia, one joint is liable to special implication, more particularly the knee, and next the elbow. The diseased action lighted up in it may go on to inflammatory disorganisation. Destructive suppuration may be set up in it, and loss or permanent impairment of utility of the limb will be the inevitable result. ^ Pathology.—That the blood undergoes important changes in this disease IS unquestionable, and there are many reasons for believing with Virchow, to are indebted for much light on this subject, that at least three diflerent conditions may present themselves ; which, although probably co- oxistingMu the majority of cases, yet are of independent origin, and may each ^ editing cause of some special symptoms, which, taken altogether, constitute the disease called pyiemia. These three conditions arc- thc affectintTr^^ ^^^1 colourless blood-corpuscles, constituting the afiection termed Leucocytosis, which has been commonly viewed as a proof of the admixtiue of pus with the circulating fluid. ^7i8 PYuEMIA. 2. The formation of Thromlii, and the changes which take place in them, leading to Embolism or Metastatic Deposits. 3. An absoiption of ichorous or putrid matter, and the commingling of this with the hlood-strcam, producing the condition called Icboi*rb8emia or Septicaemia. It ■will be desirable to consider these three conditions and their consequences seriatim. 1. Leucocytosis, or increase of the white corpuscles, with a coiTcsponding increase in the amount of fibrine in the blood, is dependent upon an over- action of the lymphatic glands, arising from an irritation applied to a part fi*eely supplied with lymphatic vessels. The character of the iii’itation has, however, an important influence in determining the occuivence of this condi- tion ; thus, an erysipelatous or diffuse phlegmonous inflammation, affecting at an early period the lymphatic vessels and glands, may be expected to produce leucocytosis far more rapidly and certainly than a superficial inflammation of the skin due to traumatic or other simple causes. In consequence of the adhesive character of these white corpuscles, they may often be found, when present in considerable numbers, to be collected into masses or groups attached to the walls of the vein, thus giving rise to the belief that they are really pus- corpuscles, from which indeed they are indistinguishable, and that they are the products of inflammatory changes in the walls of the vessels. This may be well seen in any part w^here coagulation has taken place, the clot presenting a layer of milky whiteness due to the entanglement of the white corpuscles in the meshes of the flbrine. It cannot be doubted that any considerable increase in the numbers of bodies possessing such marked powers of adhesion, both to one another and to the walls of the vessels, must tend to diminish the freedom of the circulation through the smaller vessels and capillaries, and thus facili- tate the occmrence of stasis in the vessels. This condition of the blood seems to be connected with a state of general depression, and a pallor or a certain yellowness of the skin. How far it is connected ^vith the formation of the metastatic and secondary abscesses characteristic of the true pytemic state, is not yet deteimined ; although the demonstration of the passage of the white corpuscles through the walls of the vessels, and their further development into pus-corpuscles, renders the view suificieiitly plausible, that some such connec- tion exists. 2. The subject of Thrombosis and Embolism is one of the most impor- tant that can engage the attention of the scientific Surgeon, as upon a ftfll comprehension of the circumstances attending these processes will in great measure depend his knowledge of the pathology of this disease. The which lead to the formation of a thrombus or clot in a vessel arc of three kinds, viz.— a. Ketardation of the blood-stream ; due to (a) Diminished ms a iei'go; (|3) Diminished calibre of the vessel ; (y) Interruption of its continuity. t. Changes in the condition of the wall of the vessel, or the presence of foreio-n bodies ; due to (a) Imperfect nutrition of the wall of the vessel, com- plete‘"or incomplete ; Injuries to the wall, or presence of foreign bodies. c. Altered conditions in the blood itself; due to (a) Leucocytosis ; (/3) Scpticccmia.CAUSES OF THROMBOSIS. 719 A thrombus forms more frequently in a vessel of medium size than in one of very large or very small calibre ; and, as might be expected, more fr’equently in a vein than in an artery of equal magnitude. The phenomena attending the formation of a thrombus in an artery have been akeady considered, and it will therefore only be necessary here to review those results of coagulation in the veins which are intimately connected wth the subject before us. It will be desirable to consider the influence of these causes seriathn. a. Diminished vis a tergo may result fr’om want of power in the contrac- tions of the heart. This may be due to old age, bad nourishment, cardiac •disease, or to severe shock or loss of blood from an injury or operation. The force of the heart is also weakened in all exhausting febrile diseases, as erysi- pelas, severe traumatic fever, or hospital gangrene. InteiTuption to the proper distribution of the force through want of elasticity in the arteries acts in the same way. The cm-rent of blood under these circumstances flows with less rapidity through the veins, and coagula are hable to form around the valves or in any dilatation that may hajjpen to exist. Another very common cause of retardation consists in the clmimdion of calibre produced by the pressm-e of a tumom- upon a vessel, or by the contraction following inflammatoiy exudation in the substance of an organ : examples of these conditions may be frequently seen in the iliac veins pressed upon by a pregnant uterus or an ovarian tumomv and in the vessels of a cirrhotic liver ; and it must be remembered that a tight bandage may act in exactly the same way. The most important cause, how- ever, is undoubtciily the interruptmi of the floio of blood which follows the division of a vein during a surgical operation. Several circumstances influence this result in an important manner ; thus, if a vein be divided imniediately below the site of a pah of valves, these being closed by the pressure from above, coagulation will take place in the column of blood thus rendered stationary ; the clot may be hmited or may extend to a considerable distance along the vessel, and not unfrequently small isolated thrombi form around the valves of the venous tranks leading from such an occluded branch. This process has been commonly described as phlebitis, the coagulation being viewed as secondary to the inflammatory changes in the coats of the vessel, w'hich usually ensue, sooner or later. These considerations offer a probable explanation of the evil effects which frequently foUow' the application of a ligature to a large venous trunk ; because, as a lai’ge column of blood is in these cases rendered stagnant, coagulation rapidly sets in and is not easily limited. b. Amongst the second class of causes, inflammation of the- coats of the vessets, arteritis and phlebitis, formerly occupied the most prominent position. Hunter described two forms, the suppurative and adhesive ; and he considered that an exudation was thrown out upon the surface of the lining membrane, which acted as the exciting cause of the thrombosis. This has, however, been shown to be incorrect. The external coat may become inflamed, and the muscular coat suffers secondarily and becomes swollen, producing not only a narrowing of the calibre of the vessel but some iiTegularity on its inner sui’face. us may load to coagulation ; and it is by no means necessary for this that 0 mflamraatory action should reach the stage of suppuration, and that necrosis 0 e inner coat should take place. All that is necessary is, that the inflam-720 PYJiMIA. mation should be sufficiently severe to deprive the living wall of the vessel foi- a time at least ot its vital properties ; and this may occm’, as experiment has shown, at a point far short of actual death. It is possible, therefore, for phlebitis to gixe rise to the lormation of a thrombus, and afterwards to pass off, leaving the clot enclosed in a healthy vessel, under which circumstances it may undergo gradual absorption and perhaps partial organisation without doino- fiu-ther mischief. In the gTeat majority of cases of phlebitis it is, however, 510W believed that the inflammation of the wall of the vein is the result of the thrombus which has arisen from one of the causes here mentioned, and not the primary cause of the coagulation. Coagulation in a vein thus differs from the same occurrence in an artery, for the deposit of fibrine which takes place upon the roughened walls of a degenerated artery must be considered as having a protective influence, and as tending to lessen the danger of ruptme. The protrusion of foreign bodies, such as spicula of bone, or fr'agments of atheroma or fibrine, may give rise to the formation of a thrombus at any spot, and may be considered under the same head as embolism. c. Among changes in the blood itself, which lead to the formation of thrombi, those conditions abeady described under the head of leucocytosis necessarily occupy an important position, as tending not only to diminish the rapidity of the flow in consequence of the increased viscidity of the fluid, but to cause an increase in the amount of coagulable material or fibrine. It is doubtful whether this condition alone would suffice to produce coagulation in the vessels ; it must, however, be a powerful predisposing cause. It is probable, also, that certain septic conditions of the blood may tend to increase the liabihty to coagulation in the smaller vessels and capillaries in consequence of altered or arrested function of certain organs—lungs, hver, or kidneys. This is, however, probably the least important influence produced by septic conditions of the blood, which seem rather to lead to the softening and break- ing down of clots than to their formation. Changes.—A thi-ombus, having formed, usually imdergoes certain changes either of a destructive or a productive character, the results being classed as follows :— a. Changes in the clot itself leading to organisation, obsolescence, or soften- ing and breaking down; b. Changes in other parts due to the formation of the clot, viz., changes iu the walls of the vessel and the establishment of the collateral circulation ; or to the destruction of the clot. _ The wall of the vessel usually contracts upon the contained clot, which oradually shrinks, becomes denser, more flbriUated, and ultimately penetrated by vessels. It may subsequently undergo calcareous degeneration, leading to the formation of phleboliths, not unfrrequently foimd in venous plexuses. The changes which end in disintegration produce, however, the most serious results, leadincr to secondary htemorrhage in the case of the arteries, and to blood- poisoiflng or metastatic deposits in that of the veins. The causes vfrich lead to these changes are somewhat obseme; but they are gencraUy dependent upon bad hygienic sunmmdings and septic or epidemic influences. The healthy or- o-anisation and absorption of a clot cannot take place if the wall of the vessel enclosing it and tlie sm-roimding parts be in a state of inflammation and sup-721 EMBOLISM. purafcion ; and this state of things is no doubt one of the most frequent causes of disintegration. Diffuse inflammation spreading up the loose connective tissue surrounding the vein not unfrcquently leads to a similar result. The general health of the patient has the same influence on the absorption and organisation of a clot as it has on the growth of healthy granulations on the surface of a wound. In those conditions in which Ave find wounds foul and unhealthy, and discharging sanious or ichorous pus, we susjject that thrombi, if present in any A^essel of magnitude, wiU run great risk of disintegration. Those bad hygienic surroundings and septic or epidemic influences which cause one condition, equally produce the other. Whenever a clot is actually exposed to decomposing matter, it of course rapidly decomposes and disintegrates itself. It is remarkable hoAV very rapidly large clots may become disintegrated, and be washed away by the blood-stream in a state of minute subdivision, sometimes without producing any apparent results. Should, however, the fragments be of larger size, the phenomena of Embolism are produced ; or should they be impregnated Avith the j>roducts of unhealthy inflammation or decomposition, the most grave blood-poisoning is the result: these effects have been carefully studied by Virchow, to Avhose admirable researches science is indebted for an explanation of the results of these j>rocesses. An embolon is a solid body which has entered the current of the circulation. ^It may consist of detached fragments of fibrine, calcareous or atheromatous ‘matter, foreign bodies, or entozoa. The effects which it produces Avill depend upon its size and qualities, and upon the part of the circulation into which it may have entered. Thus it may become arrested in vessels of considerable size, or in the smallest arteries or capillaries ; if it commence its career within an arterial trunk, it may become impacted in the smaller branches or in the capillaries of the systemic circiflation ; Avhereas, if it arise Avithin a vein, it Avill probably be an’ested in the branches of the pulmonary or the portal circulation. Sometimes, though rarely, the special characters of the embolon aviU enable the obserA'^ei" to decide as to what may have been its origin and course. It has been doubted AV'hether a fragment of notable specifle gravity entering the right side of the heart from the vena cava could be propelled into the branches of the pulmonary artery, and thus become imj^acted in the lung ; the exjAeriments of Virchow have, however, indisputably proved the possibility of this occurrence. It is to embolism that modern pathologists ascribe the formation of most, if not all, the metastatic abscesses found in the lungs of patients who have died pyajmic; and they consider that the embolon is derived rather fr’om the destruction of pre-existing thrombi, than from the entrance of true pus into the circulation. Much attention has been directed to the question Avhether the admixture of pus Avith the blood necessarily leads to the occlusion of A^essels and the formation of capillary thrombi; and the inquiry can hardly be said to be exhausted. These can, however, be no doubt that, although the JZZ corrmscles of pus and blood are identical in their microscopic characters, they yet differ materially m their vital properties, and that the presence of nus in anynotable quantities would lead to the occlusion of A’essels anditsconse qucnces. The impaction of an embolon is indicated by the sudden occun-ence of certain general symptoms, such as pain, numbness, or rigor • bu^ ' 1 sjuupto™ w,ll neeessarily var, aceor4'ng to the’orgau^feted f t^ h! 3 APYyEMIA. 722 embolism of the brain paralysis Avail follow, whilst in that of the linm dyspnoea is most prominent. The immediate local effect of the occlusion of a vessel is the production of intense congestion in the surrounding parts, which is usually followed by haemorrhage and the consequent production of the haemorrhao-ic infarcts .commonly seen in these cases ; the changes which subsequently take place in the part affected will depend upon the facility with which the col- lateral circulation is established, and upon this also will depend in great measure the maintenance of its vitality. The appearance produced by these changes will vary with the structure of the particular organ in which they occur, with the character of its vascular supply, and with the exact point at which the body has become impacted. For a full account of these peculiarities, the reader must consult special works on Pathological Anatomy. It must not, however, be supposed, that the occurrence of embolism and pyasmic abscesses stand invariably in the position of cause and effect; it is only under certain conditions, at present imperfectly imderstood, that the foimer may give rise to the latter. It is, indeed, a matter of common occm-rence to find hasmorrhagic infarcts in the spleen or kidney, or more rarely in the liver or lung, without there being any reason to suppose that the patient had, at the time of their occmTence, suffered from any pygemic symptoms. It is, in fact, the character of the embolon itself that determines the subsequent results, and there is no reason to believe that a simple embolon, whether arterial or venous, has any tendency to set up acute inflammatory changes at the spot where it" lodges, merely by its mechanical action. On the other hand, if the embolon be impregnated with the infective j)roducts of unhealthy inflammation, or of decomposition, wherever it lodges acute inflammatory changes, culminating in abscess or gangrene, must necessarily result. This has been experimentally proved by Virchow, Crnveilhier, Panum, Savory, and others, by the mtroduc- tion of small solid masses into the circulation. It was found that when the foreign body was in itself unirritating, as wax. India-rubber, &c., only the ordinary changes due to the local disturbance of the circulation followed its impaction in the pulmonary vessels ; but when it possessed chemical or me- chanical irritating properties, inflammation invariably occurred. The effect was most marked when the embolon consisted of animal matter in a state of decomposition. Savory showed that putrid pus or blood-clot, injected without being prevriously Altered, always gave rise to pygemic abscesses in the hmg, while the same fluids, carefully filtered, produced no abscesses, but gave rise to intense fever and symptoms of general blood-poisoning. Pygemic abscesses may, however, occur in an organ having no direct vnscular connection with the part in which the original lesion exists, and in circumstances which render it im- possible to conceive that any sohd particles could have passed from the one to the other ; we must, therefore, seek for some other cause to account for their formation, and this will lead us to the subject of blood-poisoning. 8. The third condition which is present in many cases of so-called pygemia, and which is probably the actual cause of many of the symptoms, is that of blood-poisoning, Ichorrhaemia or Septicaemia, due to the absoiqDtion of ichorous or of putrid matter, and its entrance into the circulation. This subject has been inv''estigated experimentfdly by a very large number of observers during the last ten years, amongst Avhom Ave may mention, as the723 ICHORRHJEMIA OR SEPTICAEMIA. most distinguished, Burdon Sanderson, Billroth, 0. Weber, Hiieter, Savory, and Davaine. The results of their laboiu's may be summed up as follo-\vs. The injection of any fluid into the blood of an animal, even pure distilled water, will give rise to a temporary elevation of temperature. The injection ■of fluids derived from a part in a state of acute inflammation always raises the temperatm’e considerably, but if the inflammation be of an unhealthy character the effects are much more marked. In the same way, severe effects may be produced by the injection of carefully filtered infusions of organic matter in a state of decomposition. The milder effects produced by these injections con- sist simply of a brief attack of fever Avith its usual symptoms, thirst, anorexia, high temperature, and quick pulse, and when these have passed away the animal is as well as before. The more severe effects are of two kinds, acute and chronic. The acute are characterised by rigors, high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, acute internal inflammations, as peritonitis, pleiu’isy, or pericarditis, and in some cases by metastatic abscesses and by patches of diffuse cellulitis. In extreme cases, the animal may die collapsed in a few minutes before fever ■can declare itself. Every stage may be produced at wiU between these cases •of most mahgnant blood-poisoning and the mildest febrile disturbance, by A’arying the natm’e of the fluid and the conditions of the experiment. The •chronic effects produced, siqDposing the animal to escape the acute pyaemic condition, are identical in eA’ery way Avith tuberculosis, consisting of an over- growth of the lymphatic tissues. The effects produced in these experiments vary, 1st, vdth the nature of the fluid injected ; 2nd, Avith the quantity in- jected ; 3rd, Avith the mode of injection ; and 4th, Avith the animal experi- mented on. 1. TlieJSature of the Poison. Dr. Biu’don Sanderson has shoAvn that the fluids capable of producing the most potent effects are in aU cases characterised by the presence of minute organisms variously spoken of as bacteria, micro- •z^es, or micrococci, and that the effect produced varies to a certain extent Avuth the appearance of these organisms. The part Avhich they play in the process •of infection is at present undetermined. That they can appear in the products •of subcutaneous inflanmation which have never been exposed to the external air IS certain, but this is no proof of their having been generated at the part, as they may ha^ come from Avithout and found their way to the inflamed spot by the blood. There is no evidence to show that the poison need be of any specific character, like that of an acute specific disease. It has been abundantly proved by experiment that all the symptoms of septicaemia or blood-poisoning may e pio need by the injection of simple albuminous matter in a state of •lhooldT^-^°^’ f necessary that the fluid injected •effee s or putridity; in fact, the most malignant T- • - n . by fluids free from decomposition, and their effects DrCdr decomposes.

This curious increase in the Airulence of the poison as the result of transference from one individual to another is, to say the least, very suggesth'e to the practical Surgeon, and should make him doubly careful, lest by the use of sponges or by his OAvn uiiAA'ashecl hands he should, as it were, repeat the experiment on his patients. 2. The intensity of the effect varies Avith the quantity injected, when the injections are made directly into the blood. If the injections of the more Airulent fluids be made under the skin or into a serous cavity, they excite local inflammations, the fluid products of which possess the same virulent pro- perties, and thus the effect aatII not vary so directly with the amount of fluid injected. 3. The Mode of Injection.—Some fluids, for the reason just stated, act more powerfully Avhen injected into a serous caAuty or into the subcutaneous cellular tissue than AA'hen injected directly into the blood. 4. The Animal Eximlmented on.—Dr. Sanderson has clearly shoAvn that different classes of animals are differently affected by the same poison, and that different indiA'iduals of the same class present very different poAvers of resist- ance. Thus all rodents are pecuharly susceptible to infective processes, while dogs are much less so. Sanderson thinks that the human subject is probably intermediate between the two. That different individuals of the same species are differently affected by the same poison, is a point of gTeat interest. It is doubtless the same Avith the human subject, and in all probability the suscep- tibihty to the effects of these virulent infective poisons varies greatly from time to time in the same individual. This Ave have unfortunately only too often the opportunity of verifying by the observation of dissection-woimds. A student in robust health may usually inoculate himself with impunity fr’om almost any dissection or ^oet mortem examination, but one exhausted A\ith over-work or dissipation wordd under the same circumstances run the greatest risk of blood- poisoning. In the same way, there can be no doubt that the patients admitted into a hospital fr’om dirty homes and fr-om every condition of bad hygiene, are far more liable to suffer from blood-poisoniug than those who have lived in better circumstances. By what channels the poison enters the system is still uncertain ; it may be either by the veins or by the lymphatics. Of one thing, hoAvever, there seems to be no doubt, that healthy granulations under circiuustances of ordmaiy pressure offer a decided barrier to the passage of any of these infective materials into the blood, and it is also just as certain that recent wounds, before then- surfaces are covered with organising lymph or granulations, offer them a ready entrance. In fact, tha experiment of injection of decomposing matter into the lymphatics is often unintentionally perfoimed by the Surgeon, wound of any size under ordinary dressing be closed too tightly, an no mn age be provided for the necessary serous discharge, it will be lomid that after725 POST MORTEM APPEARANCES. about SC to 48 hours the patient’s temperature rises perhaps to 103° Fahr. or 104° Fahr., and all the signs of severe fever set in. On looking at the wound the stitches will be found to be tight, and on removing one the serous fluid will flow out, having a distinct odour of decomposition, and the fever will then oradually subside. Here the decomposing fluid will have been pent up at high pressiu’e in a cavity surrounded on all sides by the unclosed lymphatics, which have been divided in the wound, and the experiment of injection is as accurately performed as if done Avith a syringe under the skin of a dog. It merely recpiires that the quantity of fluid injected should be sufficient, or that the susceptibility of the individual should be great enough, to convert such a case as the above into one of septictemia. In the same way, there is reason to believe that the fluid portions of pus pent up at any degree of pressiu’e in a caA'ity may be absorbed. If the jdus be healthy, the effect will be merely to produce the ordinary febrile distiu’bance accompanying such conditions, but if unhealthy or decomposing, it may give rise to intense blood-poisoning. There is no reason to believe that the entrance of pus corpuscles into the blood plays any part in the process—as originally supposed by Arnott, Hmiter, Berard, and Sedillot. It Avill be seen, therefore, from Avhat has been said aboA^e, that in the opinion of many modern pathologists no sharp line can be drawm between ordinary siu’gical or traumatic fever and septicmmia—just as Sander- son has shoAvn that no sharp line can be drawn between inflammations, the products of which possess decided infective properties, and those which do not; and no one at present can say exactly where one ends and the other begins. Briefly then, to sum up our present knowledge of pymrnia it may be stated that, 1. The metastatic abscesses can in many cases be distinctly traced to the results of embolism ; the embola having started fr’om softening clots in the veins of the part from Avhich the disease originated, and being imj)regnated A7ith some poison which causes them to excite acute inflammation whereA’er they lodge. This poison may be in some cases something specific, of which Ave have no knowledge at ju’esent, or it may consist of the products of ordinary decomposition. 2. The other symptoms of pyaemia are fully accounted for by the entrance of J;he same poisons into the system in a fluid or minutely subdivided form. o. The most characteristic feature of the fluids which possess these iii- ectiA^e properties is the irresence of minute organisms, bacteria, microzymes, whence these originate, or what part they take in the process of infection, is stiU a disputed point. 4. Cases occur in which embolism forms no part of the affection, and n eis m Avhich embolism is all important and blood-poisoning comparatively aecon aiy. The former are included by some Surgeons under the names of sep icccmia and ichoiTha3mia, and the latter under the names of pyremia or «m 0 aemia. In this country, hoAVCA^er, it is more common to extend the name pyaemia to both conditions. the abore brief eketoh of the more P rtant pathological conditions Avhich constitute the pyremic state the ™ ’ body usually changes rapidly after death, decomposition setting in at an726 PY.EMIA. Gculy pei’iod ; the skin is genertilly of a dii’fcy-ycllow tinge, sometimes inteiisely jaundiced, uitli numerous spots ot livid mottling, due to the occurrence of local congestion. Any external wound may present a grey, sloughy or dry appearance ; and dark red lines may be seen extending upwards, indicating the course of the veins or lymphatics. d he Sloocl will often be found to be of a dai’k colour, fluid, oi' miperfectly coagulated, although sometimes it may present no abnormal appearance what- ever. Large numbers of white blood-corpuscles may be readily seen under the microscope, sometimes collected into masses, or entangled in a clot so as to give it a milky white appearance. The red corpuscles are frequently found to have broken up even before death, and the senim to be consequently darkly stained with blood-pigment. The Heart is frequently the seat of small extravasations, which may be found either beneath the pericardial or endocardial lining, or in the muscular substance itself. Sometimes, though not very often, abscesses are found situated either in the wall or in the papillary muscles ; these are usually small collections of puriform matter, rarely much larger than a pea, and often sm’- rounded by a zone of congestion or hmmorrhage. The muscular substance is flabby, and the lining membrane of both the heart and aorta is more or less deeply stained by imbibition of the coloiuing matter of the blood. Peri- carditis may result primarily from the formation of metastatic abscesses m the heart, but is usually secondary to the inflammation of the pleiua, Avhich is often very intense. Occasionally diflPuse acute inflammation of the muscular structm’e of the heart is found, without any distinct abscess having been formed. The Lungs are much congested, especially at the posterior bases, where the tissue is friable ; sometimes this congestion passes into true pneumonia, Avhich almost always exists to some extent at least. The most important condition present in these cases is the existence of metastatic abscesses, which may vary much in number and size. These are commoifly found scattered over the siu'face, and are almost invariably siurounded by a zone of condensed lung- tissue, the result either of inflammatory action or of haemoiThagic mjection ; and are still fiuther smTounded by an area of active congestion. The position of these abscesses is usually indicated on the siuface by a shght elevation ; their form is most commoifly wedge-shaped, the broader part or base being directed towards the surface. The central part of the mass consists of a grey slough, which may or may not have softened down into a grumous semi-fluid matter. The area of haemorrhage, measuring from one-eighth to half an inch in breadth, may present the ordinary characters of Imig-apoplexy, closely resembling damson-cheese on section ; or, it may appear of a tawny-yellow colour fr’om partial reabsorption of blood-pigment. The size of these deposits varies greatly, from less than that of a pea to two or three inches in diametei. They are most commonly foimd on the posterior siutace of the lower lobe, or in the interlobular flssm’e. The pleiuisy lyhich accompanies, and piobably in most cases results from, the formation ol the deposit is often Aeiy se\eie. le pleiu’al siu'face is freely covered with patches of inflammatoiy l} inph, w i s coiTesponding quantities of deeply coloured tiubid fluid arc usually collecte into the plem'al sac. Sometimes, though rarely, small collections of pus are727 POST MORTEM APPEARANCES. found scattered througli the substance of the organ -without aflFecting its pleural surface, or gi-vdng rise to any of the wedge-shaped masses above described. The Liver fi’equently presents no abnormal appearances, even in severe cases, where the lungs have sutfercd most markedly ; in others, again, it is the seat of many abscesses, which often attain a ^-ery large size. They have much the same character, both as to form and position, as those in the lungs, and are usually sun’ounded by a zone of hEemorrhage and congestion. "WTien, however, they occur as primaiy abscesses without any deposits in the lungs preceding them, they may appear as simple collections of pus, ha-dng a more or less branched an-angement. This foim of pya3mic deposit does not appear to be the result of embolism, but to be referable to those other conditions of ichor- rhEemia or septicEemia Arhich have been already described. It must be remem- bered that hepatic abscess may result from intestinal mischief, either typhoid or dysenteric ; and therefore the occurrence of this condition does not neces- sarily indicate the existence of general pyEemia. In cases in which the general blood-poisoning is more marked than the local effects, the liver is found to be swollen, its structm’e is soft and more friable than usual, and its coloiu’ uniform and muddy. The epithelium is found on microscopic examination to be ex- cessively granular. 1 he Spleen is usually large, soft, very friable, and often of an almost pulpy consistence. Infarcts uncomiected with the pyaemic state are frequently met Avith in this organ ; metastatic abscesses are not, however, very common. The Kidneys probably stand next to the liA^er in the order of frequency Avith Avhich they are affected. They are almost invariably swollen and soft; the epithehum cloudy, excessively granular, and often choking the tubules in imgular niasses. They are A-ery fr’equently congested, and sometimes the seat 0 destructive nephritis ; when abscesses aj)pear, they jDresent the same varieties as those found in other parts. The Intestines rarely suffer, but abscesses may be found in the submucous or subserous areolar tissue. Local peritonitis not unfrequently foUows the formation of hepatic abscesses, and may become very severe.

In other cases, with the heaffhy body ^ abscesses, the appearances may be those of a perfectly728 PYAEMIA. Treatment.—The Preventive Treatment of pycemia consists in a scrupulous attention to those hygienic measures which have Ijeen described in the earlier chajiters of this work ; and, abo\’o all, to a carei'ul avoidance of ovemmvcUng. It^ is impossible to speak too forcibly on the necessity of avoiding this O'n il in siu’gical Avards, if we wish to prcA'ent outbreaks of pyaemia. I he more the patients are isolated, the less AA'ill be the liability to pyaemia. If the aggregation of patients favom-s the deA-elopment of this disease, their segregation is the best preventive: abundant cubic space of air, free ventilation, and scrupulous attention to cleanliness will do more to prevent the dcA'eloi> ment and spread of pyemia than any other precautions that may be adopted. In fact, none are of any avail if these be neglected. Yet it is impossible not to admit that the constitution of the patient himself may haA^e much to do Avith the production of the disease ; and it is often distressmg to the Surgeon to feel that, whatever care may be bestoAved upon the patient after an operation or accident, in these respects, the evil influences to which he has been exposed previously to its occiu’rence may have so conhiminated his blood, that pymmia becomes almost an inevitable sequence of any suppuratiA'e inflammation that is set up. As it is now AveU knoAvn that the absorption of decomposing animal fluids is an efficient cause of aU the symptoms of pyaemia, too great care cannot be taken to prevent putrefaction in the discharges. Lister states that by his antiseptic method of treating he has almost abolished pyaemia in his practice. As, however, from what has been said before Avhile treating of the pathology of pyaemia, it is clear that the disease may arise independently of decomposition, no system of di’essing can be expected absolutely to pre- vent it in all cases. A feAv exceptional cases Avill probably occin, in spite of everything that can be done to prevent it. In addition to ordinary prophylactic hygienic measures, there are a fcAv of a more special character. Thus, pus should abvays be freely let out, especially if it be sanious, decomposing, or offensive. Quinine or iron may be given before an operation, or as soon after as the patient’s condition will bear it; and a liberal supply of good nourishment enjoined. Disinfectants, especially ' carbolic acid and the chlorides, should be freely used. Some Simgeons have advocated the internal administration of agents that haA'e a special antiseptic character, as the hyposulphites and siflpho-carbolates ; but their use does not seem to have been attended with the benefit that was expected from them on theoretical grounds. The Curative Treatment of pytemia is most unsatisfactory. It doubtless happens that patients occasionally recover fr’om this disease, eA’en after the formation of diffuse abscesses; but such a result must be looked upon as a happy exception to its commonly fatal termination. The only plan of treat- ment that holds out any reasonable hope of success, appears to me to be the stimulating and tonic one, consisting of brandy or A\ane, ammonia, bark, and beef-tea ; in fact, that plan of treatment which is usually adopted in lowfeACis and inflammations. I have certainly seen service done in some cases, and indeed recovery effected, by the administration of large doses of quinine ; Aa e grains being given every third or fourth hour, Avith the best effect. Beyond this I do not think it necessary to go. Among many others I may mention a729 CURATIVE TREATMENT. Tery serious case of pyaemia following amputation of the arm, and accompanied not only by all the sjanptoms of that disease in a very marked degree, but by pleuritic elfusion, swelling and tenderness over one hip, and secondary hmmor • rhage from the stump, which was cured under the tonic and stimulating plan of treatment. The quinine very decidedly checks the rigors ; but does not appear to influence the temperature or the sweats. In some cases I have administered the chlorate of potash largely (5 ij to 5 iv in the day), in addi- tion to the quinine and 'wane, with apparent benefit. If the depression be very great, carbonate of ammonia in fiA'C to ten or even fifteen grain doses may be given, well diluted, from time to time ; such fluid nourishment as the patient Avill take, noth a liberal allowance of wine, porter, or brandy, being also administered. In addition to this medicinal treatment, hygienic measures must be put in force. The patient should throughout be placed in an airy and well-ventilated apartment, and cleanliness carefully attended to. In the case of a superficial vein being inflamed, it has been recommended by Bonnet, B^rard, and Langier, that the actual cautery should be fuUy apphed along the course of the vessel; and they state that the best results have followed this practice. As abscesses form, they must be freely opened ; and the diffuse and purulent collections forming in the areolar tissue must be evacuated ; the cavities being well syringed out with antiseptic lotions. In cases arising as the consequence of acute osteo-myelitis following amputations or compound fractures, removal of the hmb at the next joint above the affected bone has been recommended and successfully practised by Sir J. Fayrer, even after one or more well marked rigors. If convalescence take place, the patient will slowly recover. The rigors and sweats will gradually become less frequent; the appetite wiU improve; the countenance will lose its anxious expression, and the skin its unhealthy hue. But strength returns slowly. The disease may assume a relapsing character. Gieat caution, therefore, is necessaiy before a patient can be pronounced safe. E\en after recovery he ^vill continue pale and wasted ; energy is lost; nutrition is impaired ; and at a more remote period some low form of disease, as phthisis or albuminiu’ia, may j^rove fatal. *TUMOURS. 730 CHAPTER XXXIY. TUMOURS* The frequency with whidi Tumours fall under the observation of the Surgeon, the great variety in their characters, and their important relations, local as weU as constitutional, render their consideration one of great moment. According to Hunter, a tumour is “ a circumscribed substance produced by disease, and different in its nature and consistence from the surrounding parts.” This defi- nition, though not perhaps accinately comet in some forms of tiunom-, which do not differ in their uatm-e from neighbom-ing parts, is yet chnically con- venient. By a tumoiu’ may also be meant a more or less circumscribed mass, grovdng in some tissue or organ of the body, and dependent on a morbid excess of, or deviation from, the nutrition of the part. These growths may therefore be considered mider the two heads of local hypertrophies, or outgrowths of the normal structure of the part; and of new formations, presenting structural characters which differ more or less widely from those of the parts aroimd. The tumour thus formed increases m size by an inherent force of its own, imspectively of the growth of the rest of the system, but still obeys the same laws of growth which govern the body generally. In order to constitute a tumour, it is necessary that the normal form of the part be mdely departed from; a mere increase in its size, so long as it preserves its usual shape, being scarcely considered in this light. Thus if the tibia be uniformly enlarged to double its natm’al size, the enlargement is a hypertrophy ; but if a comparatively small rounded mass of bone project directly forwards fr’om its tuberosity, it is said to be a tumom and not a mere hypertrophy. Classification of Tuaioues.—A classification of tumours maybe founded either upon their anatomical structure, or upon their vital and clinical characters ; and although these two systems may occasionally lead to a some- what similar grouping of individual growths, yet one knowledge is at present too imperfect to enable us to point out in every case the connection between clinical history and histological structm-e. Smgeons have long divided tumoiu-s into two great classes—the Won-malignant and the Malignant. This division, however, though practically convenient, is not scientifically exact. Although some tumours, as the cancers, are always and essentially malignant, and othei’s as uniformly benign, as lipomata and some cysts, yet many others that are Tlie most exliaustive treatise on this subject is Vii'ohow’s great work, “Die Kraukliaften Gesclinnilste " hniiin-,, wiiiist ill Ilia “ Uellular Pathology ” will be I'ound an exiiosition of his yiey s or (the Pathology of Tumours), whilst iu his ... , the (levelopiiieut of new formations.

The Non-Malignant, Innocent, or Benign Tumours are strictly local in their development, and are rarely connected with any constitutional or hereditary peculiarity. They resemble more or less comj)letely the normal textures of the part ill which they grow, and hence are very commonly, though not perhaps with strict propriety, termed homomoiyhous. They usually, though not invarialily, grow slowly, are more or less distinctly circumscribed, being often enclosed in a cyst or loose capsule of connective tissue, and have no tendency to invoh’e neigh- bouring structures in their own growth ; any change that they induce in con- tiguous parts not consisting in the degeneration or conversion of these into their o\ni structm’es, but simply in displacement or atrophy by their size and pressure. They ai’e usually single, but not unfrequently multiple, developing either simultaneously or successively ; but if in the latter mode, udthout any connection with preceding growths. If removed by operation, they do not return ; but if left to the ordinary processes of natime, they slowly attain a great size, remain stationary, and, at last, atrophy, decay, or necrose. The essentially Malignant Tumours differ widely from those just described. They cannot be considered as strictly local diseases, as in many cases they result primai’ily from a constitutional or hereditary vice, or, if local in the first instance, have a tendency rapidly to affect the constitution, and to reproduce themselves in distant j)arts of the body. They are usually characterised by extreme vegetative luxuriance, but by a somewhat low vitahty, being prone to early decay ; the peripheral parts being usually in a state of active growth, while the central are undergoing fatty degeneration, ulceration, or gangrene. They represent an extreme departui’e from the ordi- naiy nutrition of the pai’t ; and, when once fomid in an organ or tissue, they dos elope by an inherent force of their ovm, irrespectively of neighbouring parts, producing masses which differ entirely in structure and appearance fr’om anything observed in the normal condition of the body, and hence are not un- ffequently called liaten'ornoiylious. This term, however, cannot be considered stiictly accurate ; inasmuch as the microscopic elements of which the masses- are composed ha’^'e their several analogues in the normal structmes of the body. But though the individual constituents of the tiunoiu’ may ]je normal^ theii aggregation and mode of arrangement are totally abnormal, and differ from everything met with in a healthy state of the tissues. The mass, w ich may either be infiltrated in the tissues, or localised, increases quickly m size ; not imcommonly, indeed, the rapidity of the growth may be taken as a measure of the malignancy of the tumour. As it increases in size, it wids to implicate the neighbouring structures in its ovm groAvth, and to affect distant organs through the medium of the lymphatics or the blood • ] lemoved by operation it has a great tendency, under certain conditions' ocal and constitutional, to return in its original site or elsewhere, though does not necessarily do so. If left to its own development, a malionant tumour wiU inevitably soften, necrose, and ulcerate, often with much min Lhe^y f ® eduction of a peculiar state of constitutional y, which speedily and necessarily terminates in death.TUMOURS. 732 Tlie following may bo looked upon as the principal signs of malignancy in those turnours—as cancers, which are clinically as well as anatomically ma- in whicl^, in fact, the. strnctiu’e taken as a whole differs from any- thing that normally exists in the body, and in which the progress of the disease has an invariable tendency to proceed from a primary local to a secondary constitutional condition. 1. The tumour, Avhether arising spontaneously or as the result of external violence, whether occurring in an individual in whom there has previously existed an hereditary tendency to similar or to allied disease, or in one whose progenitors ha^'e never evinced any tendency to similar affections, IS in\’ariably at fh-st small, and is usually defined, with a distinct outline. ’2. There is a constant tendency to the extension of the disease by local infiltration into and the absorption of neighbouring structiues; not only by their mere absorption by the pressure of an increasing growth, but by their actual incorporation into its very substance, and the deposit of the morbid mass in their place. 3. This process continues uninterruptedly; in many cases very slowly, as in scirrhus of the breast; in others, in special forms of disease and in certain situations, as in encephaloid of the testes, very rapidly. 4. The rapidity of the growth of the tumour, and of the absorption and in- corporation of the neighboiu’ing structures, is usually in the measure of and in proportion to the mahgnancy of the affection. 5. There is no limit to the size of the growth ; but when it reaches a certain point of development, its central parts undergo fatty degeneration, and in some cases a sort of cicatricial contraction. When it reaches the siuface, it speedily sloughs or ulcerates towards its centre, giving rise to profuse discharge usually offensive in character, and not unfrequently to abundant haemorrhage. Even diming this stage, its circumference continues to grow and to invade the siuTounding parts. 6. At a certain period of the growth—early in some cases, not until many months have elapsed in others—the lymphatic glands immediately above the primary disease, those intervening between it and the central portions of the system, become enlarged and hardened, in consequence of the deposit within them of morbid material identical in character with that which constitutes the primaiy or original disease. This secondary impheation of the lymphatic glands is undoubtedly due to direct absorption. It may occur before the skin is involved ; but almost invariably manifests itself when once the integiunental structimes are implicated in the malignant disease. The disease has a tendency to run the same coimse in the glands that are thus secondarily affected as it does in its primary seat. 7. At a later period than this the internal organs, more especially the hmgs and liver, become the seat of secondary deposits of a similar natime essentially, though differing possibly in some minor chai’acters, to those which were primarily developed in the' original seat of the local affection. These secondary visceral deposits occasionally become the foci of new developments ot the disease, which assume a more active and fatal character than tiie piimaiy affection to which they owe their origin. _ _ • 8. After the contamination of the lymphatic glands, the constitution of theSARCOMATOUS TUMOURS. ^ 733 \ patient exhibits evidences of serious modifications in nutrition and sangui- fication, The body wastes, the skin becomes sallow, the digestive powers become impaired, and anaemia supcr’i'cnes. 9. Death may occur in various ways :—from the exhaustive effects of the discharges, and htemon-hages fi-om the local and primary disease ; from special ’\fisceral disturbances induced by the secondary deposits ; or from malnutrition and consequent cachexy. The malignant tumours are usually of a cancerous nature, but “ malignant ” and “ cancerous ” are not synonymous terms. Every malignant tumour is not a cancer, though every cancer is a malignant growth. Some tmnours occa- sionally present the clinical characters of malignancy, though structurally they are intimately related to others which are usually looked upon as essen- tially non-malignant; and we are thus obliged to consider, that these terms . arc merely relative, and that these two great classes pass into one another by insensible gradations. It Avill be subsequently seen that the sarcomata and some cartilaginous tmnours stand in this intermediate position between the more typical examiDles of these two great groups. Those benign tumours Avhich haA^e a tendency to recur after removal, and thus to run as it were a locally malignant com’se, are usually very rapid in their growth and develop- ment. Indeed, great rapidity of growth may usually be looked upon as evi- dence either of mahgnancy of structure, or of hability to speedy recurrence after extirpation. In some cases, after repeated removals, the tendency to recur- rence appears to wear out, and the patient eventually overcomes the disease. But in other instances this fortunate result does not occur. Where tumours of any kind recur after removal, it Avill often be foiuid that the secondary differs in many important respects from the primary growth. Thus it may be found to be softer, more vascular, and more diffused. In microscopical stiTicture, it may be found to present evidences of greater activity of groAvth, and to depart more Avidely from the normal type. Paget has A'ery fully described varieties of tumours, Avhich, though differing AAudely from cancers in structure, have nevertheless destroyed the patient by repeated reciUTence after removal, and by ultimate ulceration, sloughing, and contamination of neighbouring tissues, or even of distant organs through the medium of the circulation. These tumours he described chiefly under the names, “ fibro-plastic and fibrous ; ” but they are now included under the A'arieties of sarcoma. He also makes the important observation that tumours, apparently similar in structure, may run A’ery different courses in different indiAuduals, in some being in eA'ery way innocent, and in others malignant. Thus a tumoiu’, composed purely of spindle-shaped cells, may in one case shoAV no tendency to recur after removal, or to affect distant parts ; whilst in another it may not only infiltrate smTounding tissues, but ^ve rise to secondary groAvths in internal organs. More extended observa- tion has, hoAvevor, shoAvn one very interesting difference between the mode of recurrence of these tumours, and that of true cancers. A true cancer or carci- noma invariably affects the lymphatic glands before the internal organs; whilst ^ occuiTonce for a sarcoma to become widely disseminated ^J^P^atics showing any signs of implication. would seem, therefore, that, as a rule, carcinoma is disseminated by meansTmwURS. 734 of the lymphatic vessels, and sarcoma by the blood-vessels. This rule is by no means absolute, but it is sufficiently constant to form a very interesting feature in the natural history of these diseases. Paget makes the very interesting practical remark, which agrees entirely with the result of my own observatioip that the childi-en of cancerous parents may be the subjects of tumours not carcinomatous in structure, but closely resembling such growths in the rapidity of their progress, their liability to ulcerate and to bleed, and their great dis- position to return after removal. The term Semi-malignant may be employed to include those growths which occupy the doubtful position indicated above: it must, however, be distinctly understood that this term cannot be employed in any very definite sense. Innocent and malignant tumours are occasionally met with in the same person, foiu- or five different kinds of growth even occim’ing in one individual. I have seen in one patient a scirrhous breast, enchondromatous tumoiu- of the leg, and an atheromatous cyst on the back, with scrofulous glands in the neck. New formations of different types may even be found in the same mass ; thus, encephaloid cancer and spindle-celled sarcoma are said to have been found together in the testes. This, however, must not be taken as any evidence of the possibility of the conversion of one into the other, but rather as the result of a departure in different directions from the nonnal nutrition. There is indeed no proof that a non-malignant can be converted in any circumstances into a malignant tumour of a different type ; a fibrous growth may degenerate and assume many of the characters of maligmancy, at last desfroying the patient, but there is no evidence that it can ever be changed into a can- cerous mass. A malignant tumour may, however, appear on the site of a non-mahgnant growth that has been removed : thus I have seen a scirrhous nodule deposited in the cicatrix left after the removal of a cystic sarcoma of the breast. Besides these various forms of tumours, others are met with, of a constitu- tional and specific character, such as those that occur in connection with scrofula and syiffiilis ; but these are usually looked upon in this country rather as modifications of chronic inflammation than as tumonrs. A classiflcation founded upon an anatomical basis not only enables the ob- server to comprehend the precise relation which any particular growth under observation bears to others that resemble it; but it leads him to trace the origin of the new formation fr’om the pre-existing structines of the part in which it occins, thus forming the flrst step towards a knowledge of the etiology of the disease. Tumours are said to be heterologous or homologous, according as they present a gTeater or less deviation from the normal condition of the tissues fr’om which they spring. These terms are essentially relative ; and it is only to in- stances at the extreme ends of the series that either term can be deflnitely applied. The more heterologous the growth, that is, the gveater the depai-ture from the normal nutrition of the part in which it occurs, the more malignant, as a rifle, will be its action upon the system generally ; whilst the reverse, inth some exceptions, is true of homologous formations. At the same time it must be borne in mind, that Virchow’s law holds good even in the most heterologous departures fr’om the standard of health ; this law states, that “the same types of anatomical structures exist in new formations as are found in the body735 GENERAL CHARACTERS OF TYPICAL TISSUES. generally,” and thereby denies the possibility of the occurrence of a true hete- roplasia, and the existence of specific elements in new formations. The following classification may be adopted as possessing chnical convenience, and, at the same time, presenting, as far as possible, an anatomical unifonnity. I. Cystic Tumours generally. ‘ II. Tumoiu’s composed of one of the modifications of fully developed Con- nective Tissue. a. Fat—Lipoma. h. Fibrous Tissue—Fibroma. c. Cartilage—Chondroma, Enchondroma. d.

Tiunours composed of Tissue which is either purely Embryonic, or is showing some signs of a tendency to develope into adult tissue of the Connec- tive type. ^ Sarcomata.—These are chiefly subdivided according to the shape and size of the cells of which they are composed; thus, round-celled, oval- celled, spindle-celled, giant-ceUed sarcoma, &c. _ V. Tumours composed of Cells of an Epithehal Type, arranged in spaces in a stroma consisting of more or less perfectly developed fibrous tissue. Carcinomata or true Cancers.—Scirrhous, Encephaloid, and Adenoid Cancer, Epithelioma. ,1., Tm of Tissues—Before proceeding to consider he mdividual growths, which are thus grouped together, it wiU be desirable ^hicHw Py ae structures upon vhich the types of some of the classes are founded. ^ First as to connective tissue .—This exists throughout the body, present- ing however, many varieties of foian adapted to the special ftmctions of each particular part in which it appears. It consists essentially of an interceUular or fibrillated, in which are embedded ceUs having an oval a are normaUy present. These are looked upoS of ae blood, and the iked branched tures, which constitiito^’o^i ^ ^ various cell-struc- tioii Thi. ® ^ proportion of the products of abnormal niitri ‘■00. Th.s v.ew .s, however, now abandoned by many and nnKrZlt^t736 TUMOURS. all pathologists ; the wandering Avhite corpuscles from the blood being con- sideiod by many to be the only source of new cellular growth, while others believe that although the new gTowth arises chiefly from this source, yet the j)re-existing cellular elemeuts of the part are not wholly inactive. The following tissues may be considered as belonging to this type, the pathological deviations from which must be viewed iii the same light; the connective or areolar, the white fibrous, and the yellow elastic tissues in all parts of the body, whether entering into the formation of organs, or existing as separate structures. The cartilaginous and osseous tissues represent two important modifications, but exhibit occasionally a tendency to return to the primary form as described above. Mucous tissue must also be included under the same type. Its most perfect analogue is found in the MTiartonian jelly of the umbilical cord, but it is also represented in the adult by the vitreous humour of the eye. The simplest fomr of embryonic tissue is composed of small romid cells about the size of white blood-corpuscles, and possessing the same amoeboid movements, connected with each other by a small quantity of homogeneous intercellular substance. The cell consists merely of a small mass of protoplasm with a nucleus in the centre, which is usually somewhat difficult to distinguish. The vessels m such tissue are abundant, and extremely thin-walled, like those of granulations. The modifications observable in this tissue are seeu both in the cells and in the intercellular substance. The cells may be of great size, almost resembling epithelial cells ; they may be spindle-shaped, oval, or stellate. The intercellular substance may be small in quantity and amorphous, or its quantity may be increased without apparent change in its nature. The most common modification is a development of fibrous tissue between the cells. It must 1)6 remembered, however, that, in tumours classified under the heading sarcomata, with very rare exceptions the intercellular substance, be it homo- geneous or fibrous, extends between the individual cells, in this differing from the stroma in carcinomata, which forms alveolar spaces in which the cells are grouped. In fact, it is one of the essential characters of the epithehal type of tissues, that it presents a simple cell-structnre without any intercellular sub- stance. The cells of epithelium present a very great variety in their form and size, and though usually possessing but one nucleus, may sometimes contain several nuclei, as in the transitional epithelium from the bladder. It is at the present time a disputed question whether cells of an epithelial type can ever develope except in connection with pre-existing epithelium, after the first separation of the three layers of the embryo. If it be true that they cannot, then primary carcinoma can only arise in connection with the skin, mucous membranes, and secreting glands. The flat cells lining the blood-vessels, lymphatics, and serous cavities are not now looked upon as epithehum, but are distinguished by the name of endothehum or epithelioid cells. They are different in character and origin fr-om epithelium, and can undoubtedly be developed in any part of the body. The characters presented by the several groups of tumours will now be considered. I.—CYSTIC TUMOURS. Cystic Tumours may be classified according to their contents, or accordingENCYSTED TUMOURS. 1Z1 to their anatomical cliaracters and mode of development. The following is an example of the former method. ]. Dermoid Cysts, presenting three varieties— Those containing Ejndermis. R Those containing True Skin, Hair, and Glands, r. Those containing Cartilage, Bone, and Teeth. 2. Serous Cysts, arising in four different ways— a. By Dilatation of Sacs, CaHties, or Canals, including Blood-Yessels. k By Accumulation of Fluid in the Meshes of Areolar Tissue. c. Jly Changes in Hjemorrhagic Effusions. il. By Changes in the Products of Inflammation. 8. Colloid Cysts, resulting from— a. Colloid Degeneration of Pre-existing Cells. k Colloid Degeneration of Newly formed Cells. dhe second method will, however, be adopted here as being the more simple and more clinically useful. Cystic tumoiu’s are di-vdded into two great classes :— 1. Those that are dependent upon the gradual Accimmlation of a Secretion m a naturally existing Duct or Cyst, with dilatation and hypertrophy of its waUs. ^ 2. Those that residt from the New Formation of a closed Cyst in the areolar tissue of the part, and the distension of it by the secretion fr'om its lining membrane. 1. Encysted Tumours, arising from Simple Distension and Gradual Hypertrophy of the Walls of a Duct or Cyst, are met with in three fomis : (a) Encysted tumours of the skin and subjacent areolar tissue occiu’- ring in various parts of the body, and dependent on the closm-e of the excre- toiy ducts of the sebaceous glands : (k) Tumours formed by the accumu- lation of secretions in, and the closure and dilatation of, the ducts of other secreting glands and organs, as in the sublingual or the mammary gland; (c) Those foimed by the retention and modification of the secretions in cysts Avithout excretory ducts, as in the bursaa. When these tumours arise in con- nection with ducts or cavities naturally lined with epithelium, they also possess «T. similar lining, but if they spring fr'om closed sacs such as bursaa, which are lined merely with a flattened en- dothelium, we find no true epitheliimi in the cyst.

Ihese aie usually situated upon the scalp, face, neck, or back ; sometimes, hoAvevei, they occur elsewhere thus I have removed a very large one ft’om the fore part of a girl’s arm, and others from the labia and groin. The size of these tumours varies from that of a pin’s head to arr orange ; the smallest occur on the eyelids, the largest on the shoulders and scalp. They are often very nrrmerous, especially about the head, w^here as many as thirty or forty may bo met vvdth at the same timeand most frequently they form in w'omen about the middle period of life : they are smooth, rorrnd, or oval, movable under the integument, either semi-flrrctuating or elastic, though sometimes solid to 'the touch. In some parts where the sebaceous follicles are large, as on the back, a small black point can often be detected on the sruface of the tumorrr, through which an aperture may be found leading into its interior, and allowing the expulsion of its contents. A sebaceous tumoim consists of a cyst-wall and contents. The cyst-wall is composed of dense white fibrous tissue, having elongated connective-tissue-corpuscles scattered through it. It is connected to the surrounding parts by loose areolar tissue, containing yellow elastic fibres in some abimd- ance. The thickness of the wall varies greatly. When the cyst is situated on the hairy scalp it will always be found to be tough and thick, while in all other situations it is much thiimer. Immediately in contact with the inner siu’face of the cyst-waU, a layer of ac- tively growing epithelial cells is found closely resembling the deeper layers of the epidermis ; fimther from the wall these assume a distinctly squamous form; then they become fiUed with fat granules, and finally break down into a fatty granular mass. The atheromatous mass forming the contents of the cyst is com- posed of this fatty debris (Fig. 271). If examined when freshly removed from a tumour, it will be found to be soft creamy pultaceous, or some- times cheesy-looking, of a yellowish white colour. Sometimes in old cysts it becomes dry and laminated, looking not imhke Parmesan cheese. In some cysts of old standing and large size, the contents may be semi-flmd, the more liquid parts being a brown, green, or blackish tint. These various con- tents are essentially composed of sebaceous matter, mixed in various piopoi- tions with epithelial scales, fat-granules, and cholesterine. Sometimes the cyst-wall is found to send fibrous septa towards the centre of the cyst, but tine papillcC or hair-follicles are never found in cysts due to obstruction of the cx- Fig. 271.—Couteuts of Atliei-omatous Cyst (454 cliam.) a.

Occasionally a part of the cyst-wall may undergo calcification, and calcareous particles may be found among its con- tents (Fig. 271, b). Some forms of cysts of new formation closely resemble those just described in then- contents and naked-eye appearances, but differ from them in the structm-e of their walls, which is that of true skin. These will be refeired to again imder “ dermoid cysts.” Progress.—The growth of these tumours is often very slow ; but not un- fr-ecpiently, after remaining stationary for years, they increase rather rapidly. The tumoin- itself, though painless, may give rise to uneasy sensations, by compressing nerves in its vicinity j it usually continues to grow slowly, until the patient, being annoyed by its presence, has it removed by operation. If left imtouched, it occasionally, though rarely, happens that the Sebaceous matter, exuding through an aperture on its sm'face, forms a kind of scab or crust, which by a j^rocess of subdeposition becomes conical; and, beino- gradually pushed up from below, at the same time that it assumes by exposure a dark brown colom-, forms an excrescence that looks like a horn, and is iisually considered to be of that character. These “ horns ” have been met with on the head, on the buttock, and in other situations. The accompany- Fig. 272.—Horn on Hose of a Child.

In other cases, these tmnours inflame and suppmate; the skin coveriuo- em becomes adherent and reddened, ulceration takes place, and, if the cyst je sma 1 and dense, it may be throum off by the suppurative action in the sunoundiiig tissues. If it be larger, ulceration of the integuments covering it takes place, and the sebaceous matter is exposed ; this may then putrefv ecome o ffnsive, and break away in unhealthy suppination.

Sebaceous cysts Avhich have uuder- gouc this change may, however, readily be distinguished fi-om malignant gioAvths by a micioscopical examination ot their exudations or dchris; these consisting of pus and healthy epithelium, mixed up with fatty matters more or less disintegrated. Diagnosis.—The only diseases -with which these tumours can be confounded are abscesses and fatty growths. From an abscess an encysted sebaceous tumour may be distinguished by its history, slow growths, situation, elasticity,- and mobility, and the existence of the dilated orifice of the sebaceous duct, through which some of the contents can be scpieezcd, the microscopical exami- nation of which will serve to confim the diagnosis. Yvom. fatty tumours these growths may be diagnosed by their firmer and more regular feel: and in case Fig. 274.—Large Atliennatous Cyst from the Bade, simulatiBg Fatty Tiunoiu*. (Half the natural size. i I of doubt, by the evacuation and examination of their contents. Sometimes the cysts may be lobulated so as closely to resemble a fatty tumom- (Fig. 274). But even in these cases they may be distinguished by the Surgeon pressing on the edge of the tumour ; if cystic it will remain fixed, and the finger can be pressed through it; if a lipoma it will roll away. The Treatment of a tumour of this kind simply consists in its removal, after which it is never reproduced, unless a small portion of the cyst-wall have been left behind. So long as these tumours are small, and do not give rise to deformity or inconvenience, they may be left Avithout surgical interference. But when large, and more particularly when they haA'e become inflamed, they j should be removed. The method of operation vrill vary according to their situation and the thickness of their walls. When situated on the scalp, where the cyst is dense and tough, the tumour may very readily be removed by transfixing the upper part of it and the skin covering it with a scalpel, squeez- ing out the atheroma, and then seizing the edge or bottom of the cyst-wall , with forceps and pulling it out. lu this little operation there are tAvo points that require attention ; first, the base of the cyst should ncA’cr be transfixed ; and, secondly, no attempt at dissection should be made : if either of these precautions be neglected, troublesome brnmoirhage may ensue. No dressing ,| is required after the operation, beyond a piece of dry Cotton-Avool laid on the | wound, AA'hich aauII generally heal by the fii’st intention. Should it not do so, | Avater-dressing should be applied. When these tumours occur upon the scalp, a large munber may be removed at one sitting ; as, hoAveA'er, there is alwajs some danger of erysipelas following operations in this situation, it is only pnrdent to select a favourable season of the year, and not to operate if theENCYSTED TUMOVES. 741 health be out of order. Erysipelas is the only danger to be apprehended : it is especially apt to occur in elderly people of a stout make and florid com- plexion. \\"hen seated about the back, trunk, or hbnbs, they usually require to be dissected out, being thin and more closely incorporated with the skin ; and often, in consequence of former inflammation, adherent to the subjacent parts. In doing this, cai’e should be taken that the whole of the cyst-wall is extir- pated ; the wound, which should be dressed lightly, speedily heals. If, how- ever, any portion of the wall be left, it should bo freely rubbed with nitrate of silver, lest a troublesome fistula remain. When the tumoiu’s are situated between the shoulders or on the back, and the patient is unwilling to submit to an operation, I have sometimes easily and successfully remo^'ed them by opening up Avith a probe the small black orifice, which will always be found leading into them, squeezing out the contents of the cyst, and then pushing in two or three silk threads, which, acting like a seton, have excited the requisite amount of inflammatory action to bring about a closure of the cyst. In some cases, in which, from the constitutional condition of the j)atient, or Irom prejudice on his part, the use of the knife is objectionable, these cysts may be removed by rubbing the siu’face freely either Avith potassa fusa or fuming nitric acid. I^Tien the slough so formed separates, the cyst comes aAA^ay with it. The horns and semi-mah'gnant idcers that result from these gTOAvths, may require excision. If, however’, the ulceration be connected with the cranium by its base, or be very extensiA’e, as in the case depicted (Fig. 273), it wdU be safer to treat it by the application of the chloride of zinc, or by occasionally touching it Avith fused potass. (&) A arious forms of encysted tumom* may arise fr'om the Closure and Dilatation of the Ducts of other Excretory Organs, as, for instance, cystic tmnours of the breast from the obstruction of the lacteal ducts, rauula fr’om obstruction of the duct of the submaxillary gland, mucous cysts of the mouth or A'agina fr’om the obstruction of the ducts of the mucous glands. These affections, hoAvever, constitute special diseases, the consideratioir of AAhich must be defeiTed to subsequent chapters. The general principle of Treatment of such diseases consists either in restoring the freedom of the outlet by the excision of a portion of the wall, or obliterating the cyst by making an incision into it, and alloAvdiig it to gTanulate from the bottom. (c) Cysts may arise from Distension of Ca-vities Avhich are un- provided -with any Excretory Duct, as, for instance, the bursae, which often attain a very considerable size in these circumstances. Cystic tumours formed in connection Avith the sheaths of tendons, or gancjlia, belong also to t IS class ; and strictly speaking, hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis testis should also be included. When arising from burste, the normal structure of the Avail 0 the bursa becomes greatly altered ; sometimes it is thin and expanded ; at o lers it acquires a thick fibrous, almost ligamentous appearance. Inside, the cyst IS often warty-looking, and its Avails are often laminated, the layers bein<>- composed of imperfectly developed fibrous tissue. Sometimes by gradual ’eniiig of the cyst-wall the central caA’ity becomes almost obliterated, and the disease assumes the form of a solid tumour. Not unfrequeiitly attachedTUMOmiS. 742 to the wa Is, and floating m the interior, are a number of grannlar melon- ceddike bodies, greyish or yellow in colour, semi-transparent, elongated or irregular in shape, usually rather hard, but sometimes soft and flocculent. 1 he fluid contents of these cysts arc usually thin and serous, of a yellowish or brownish^ coloim. In their progress they are found to increase up to a certain size, when they usuaUy thicken and harden, in conseciuence of the hbious transformation just described ; or else they inflame and suppurate in an unhealthy manner. They may occur in any of the situations in which bursm naturally exist or are accidentally formed, but are most commonly met ivith upon the knee-cap, the nates, or the flrst joint of the great toe, where they give rise to the attection known as bunion. The simple foims of cystic tumours of the ovaiy may be placed under this head, as they arise from dilatation of the Graafian vesicles, and are filled with a more or less clear serous fluid. They sometimes attain an enormous magnitude. The Treatment of the cysts derived fr-om bursie consists in attempting their absorption by the use of stimidating plasters ; or, if this fail, in the removal of their contents by tapping. Their cavities are then closed by exciting inflam- mation and sujipiu’ation within them, by the introduction of a seton, by injec- tion with stimulating solutions, or by the subcutaneous section. If these means fail, excision will be required, more especially if the tumour have be- come dense and fibrous. 2. Cysts that result from the New Formation of a Closed Cyst, and the Distension of it by the Secretion from its Lining Membrane. Under this heading must be included {a) Dermoid Cysts ; (h) Serous or Simple Cysts ; (c) Compound Proliferous or Multilocular Cysts; ((?) Sanguineous Cyst or Hsematoma, (ci) Dei*moid Cysts.—These were described by Lebert as presenting thi’ee chief var- ieties. 1. Cysts closely re- sembling in structure the ordinary atheromatous cyst before described, only occiu’- ing in situations in which sebaceous follicles are not nor- mally found. These are rare. 2. Cysts whose walls ju’csent all the structiu’es of true skin ; cuticle, papiUte, cutis vera, sweat-glands, sebaceous fol- licles, hau’-follicles, and hair. (Fig. 275). Their contents are usually rather thinner than those of the ordinaiy atheromatous cyst, though closely resembling them in appearance. Often a small ball of coiled- up hair is found inside the cavity. The contents are the accumulated Fig. 275.—Wall of Dennoicl cyst from the Ann (40 diam.) !i. Epklennis. Ij. Hair follicle. c. Sebaceous gland. d. Surrounding connective ti.ssue with small masses of fat.743 SEROUS OR SIMPLE CYSTS. secretions of the glands in the cyst-wall mixed with desquamated epithelium. These cysts arc by no means uncommon. They are always congenital, although they may perhaps not be noticed for some little time after birth. One of the most common situations in which they are found is at the outer angle of the orbit; hero they are excessiyoly thin-walled, requiring yery carefid dissection for their removal. If a small piece of the cyst-wall be left behind, it will give rise to a troublesome fistulous opening, or even the cyst may re-form itself. Occasionally the bones of the skull have been found to be absorbed or not developed beneath these tumours, a fact which it is importaut to remember in attempting their removal. These cysts have also been foimd within the skull. 3. The third variety of dermoid cysts in- cludes those peculiar tiunoiu’s which contain teeth and portions of bone. These haA'c been supposed to be the remains of blighted ova inclosed in the body, but this view is by no means proved. These tumours are most frequently met with in the abdomen, especially about the OA^aries, mesen- tery, and omentum ; they have also been observed in connection vnth the testis, haAing probably descended into the scrotum with this gland. A very remarkable case of this kind once occuived at University College Hospital, under Marshall. They have also been found in the lung, but never, I believe, in connection with the extremities. Cysts containing fatty matters present several varieties. The contents may be derived from the fatty degeneration of epithelial structmes, or of the con- tents of a cyst originating in any of the ways above described. Sometimes the fatty matters are in the form of a half-fiuid oily emulsion, or of a Avhite cheesy mass of the consistence of soft putty ; at others they present a A^ery peculiar appearance knoAAii as Cholesteatoma {Perlgeschioulst, Twneur PerUe). This consists of a smooth, laminated, Avhite and dry fatty mass, contained in a cyst, and composed partly of concentrically arranged epithelial cells, and partly of crystalline fat and cholesterine. Virchow has described this as a distinct variety of tumour, and considers that it is not necessarily connected with epithelial formation. It usually occurs in the temporal bone, but has been foimd in the cerebellimi. It is a very rare form of tumoim. (Z») Serous or Simple Cysts are met AAuth in almost CA’ery situation, being composed of a thin expanded wall containing a slightly viscid serous fluid. They arc usually found to be lined with a flat endothelium, like that lining the serous caA'ities. One of their most frequent situations is in the neck. The Compound, or, as they are often called. Proliferous or Midtilocular Cysts, are especially met Avith in the ovary, and have been studied Ainth great cai*e by Hodgkin, and more recently by Wilson Fox. Of these there are two Aarietics, the first consisting of an aggTegation of simple cysts closely packed and pressed together ; the second composed of cysts having others PTOAvino- rom their Avails. ^ The caA'ities of these multilocular cysts present the greatest possible variety in their contents; fluid, from a limpid serum to a semi- 8ohc ]elly-hke matter, and of OAxiy shade, from light-yeUow to greenish- ■■ g>™ths, caucerous th™ ’ cutaneous stractims, ore also found inTUMOURS. 744 V Tn f ™ «><= of co„- btuctioiis of portiom of tho clncta of glandular stmotures, associated tvith the hypertrophy and resh grotvth of tubular formations, a view which satisfae- withhi '"flwnr S “ opitheliiuu and other adenoid struetures nithin them. Some of the secondary cysts associated with tlie papillary grow hs apl»m to result from the cohesion of adjoining masses of pa,illary Btmctme, and thus present cavities hiicd with epithelium, similar to that winch lines the parent cyst and the papillary mass itself. The intracvstic growths themselves appear to be derived from the superficial strata of the stroma of the cyst-wall; and, as they arise by protrusion into tho ca\-ity of the cyst, they are necessarily covered by the same epithelium which lines the latter. Villous growths are also fomid scattered in patches on the inner surface of the cyst-wall. They are always highly vascular, consisting almost entirely of loops of V essels covered by a layer of epithelium. These are intimately con- nected with the development of gland-structures. The teim P't oliferous is also applied to those cysts in which solid intracystic growths are found, as in the proliferous cysts of the mamma. The growths projecting into these cysts assume a lobulated or cauliflower-like form, and in structiu’e are found rudely to resemble the normal structure of the mamma. These “intracystic” growths may cause by their increase in size the gTadual absorption of the more fluid contents, until, at last, their development is arrested by the cyst-waU. The tumour would then merely resemble an ordinary adenoma of the mamma surrounded by a distinct capsule. The Sanguvieo'us Cyst, or Hcn-matoma, is a peculiar variety of tho simple form, and has been described by Paget as principally occurring about the neck, the parotid, the anterior part of the thigh, the leg, the shoulder, and the pubes. It is especially characterised by containing fluid blood, more or less altered in appearance. He describes these cysts as being formed in three possible ways ; either by hEemorrhage into a previously existing serous cyst, by transformation fr’om a nm'sms, or by a vein becoming occluded and dilating into a cyst. I have seen a large hasmatoma on each ear of a lunatic. The contents were semi-solid coaguhun. These sanguineous cysts may sometimes resemble in general appearance encephaloid disease. A case of this kind was sent to me by Hemy Bennet—a tumoin of about the size of an orange, of nodulated appearance, existing in the leg of a woman below the knee, where it had been gradually increasing in size for about a couple of years. So close was the resemblance to malignant disease presented by the tumoin, that the limb had been condemned for amputation by some Siu’geons who had previously seen the case ; as, however, the growth, oh examination, proved to be a sanguineous cyst, as its walls were thin and adherent, and as it extended too deeply into the ham to admit of ready remoA'al, I reduced it by successive tappings, and then, laying it open, alloAved it to granulate from the bottom. When iwacticablc, hoAvever, the cyst- should ahvays be dissected out. In seA^eral cases recently reported, it has been found that the so-called blood- cyst, or haematoma, Avas in reality a sarcoma, the structure of Avhich had been broken doAvn by Immorrhage. See “ (Sarcomatous Blood-cysts.” The term Hcmiatoma or Blood-cyst is also aiAplicd to those cysts that result745 rARASITIG CYSTS. f . ,4inncres takino- place in extravasated blood (sec p. 18C).

Cysts of Lw formation ocenr frequently m cmmcim A lumom-s and are then duo to softening, or luemon-liage, or to dilatation of cavities existing in the structure of the tumour. Thus in cysts are frequently found as the result of mucous softening of >nati x of tlie eartilage ; in myeloid sarcomata cysts are vei-y common probably due to haimorrhage into the structure of the tumour ; and m adenoid tumouis of the breast, the imnerlect acini characteristic of the growth may become dilated into cysts. These cysts will he described more fully with the varioiis tumouis in which they occur. . Cysts also occasionally come under the care of the Surgeon which owe t origin to the presence of v^parasitP. The most common of these is that known as the hydatid cyst. This is due to the presence of the scolex (or young) of the tmiiia echinococcus. The parasite in this stage of development is cystic in form, it never reaches its fully developed state in the human body ; the tmnia (or tape- worm), of which it is the scolex, being only known to exist in the dog and wolf. In the human body it is commonly found to present the following appearances. ]Most externally is a cyst-waU composed of the tissues of the part, altered by the pressme of the cyst, and indurated by fibroid growth. Within this is the waU of the cyst belonging to the parasite. This is often half an inch or more in thickness, and is composed of a semi-transparent, elastic ^ substance, not unlike the white of a hard boiled plover’s egg. It is beautifully laminated to the naked eye, and a still finer lamination is seen under the microscope. This cyst is spoken of as the acephcdocyst. Sometimes the cyst is single, but fi’ecpiently numerous secondary or daughter cysts are found in its interioi. The contents of the cyst consist of a clear fluid of very low specific gravity, usually not over 1007', and containing either no albumen, or only the faintest possible trace. The characteristic ttenia-heads, or, as they are called, echi- nococci, arc found either adherent to the cyst-wall, or free in the fluid. The head is small and rounded, and about in. in diameter, and pro’sided with four suckers and a ring of booklets. Frequently no perfect echinococci can be found, but the booklets, being indestructible, can usually be detected. Hydatid cysts are found in almost any part of the body. They occur’ most frequent in the liver, and in other organs in the following order of frequency :—lungs, muscles and subcutaneous tissue, kidneys, lower pelvis, nervous centres, bones, and heart. They are in rai’e cases found in the eye. The cyst-wall may undergo calcification, and the tumour cease to trouble the patient. Occasionally sup- piu’ation may occiu round the cyst, and the whole may be discharged. A few years ago I opened a very large abscess in the adductor region of a young woman’s thigh, and gave exit to nearly a pint of pus, in which dozens of small hydatid cysts about the size of gooseberries were floating. The diagnosis of these cysts when seated in the subcutaneous or muscular tissues cannot be made with certainty, e.xcept by withdrawing some of the fluid with the aspirator.746 TUMOURS. and submitting it to microscopic and chemical examination. If it bo of low specific gravity and free from albumen, it is almost certain to have come from a true hydatid cyst Ihe Treatment of these cysts, when practicable, is the of the parasite. In internal organs, tapping, aspiration, and simple acupuncture, have all been successful. A few years ago I successfully rcniovod a hydatid cyst of the size of a fist from the muscles at the back of the neck of a young man. II.-TUMOUBS COMPOSED OP ONE OP THE MODIFICATIONS OP FULLY DEVELOPED CONNECTIVE TISSUE. ^ The structures included under the term connective tissue and its modifica- tions are fat, fibrous and areolar tissue, cartilage, bone, and mucous tissue. The tumoiu-s composed of any of these tissues in a state of perfect development are almost uniformly benignant. Occasionally enchondroma assumes a malignant form, but it will then be usually found that, instead of being covered by a firm fibrous membrane at the margin of the growth, there is a zone of embiyonic tissue which is infiltrating the sinTounding jiarts on one side and becoming developed into cartilage on the other. It is from this tissue, probably, that the system becomes infected, and not from the fully developed cartilage. In the same Avay, tumours ivhich to the naked eye seem to be composed of bone may assume all the characters of malignancy ; but on microscopic examination it will be found that these tumours do not grow as normal b.onc does, either from a fibrous membrane (periosteum) or from cartilage, but are in fact ossifying sarcomata. These will be described amongst the sarcomata. Again, there is no absolute boundary betAveen sarcoma and fibroma. Many tumours composed almost entirely of spindle-cells contain a large proportion of fibrous tissue between the cells. If the fibres very much exceed the cells, the gTowth would be called a fibroma ; if the reverse a sarcoma ; and one between the two is often spoken of as a fibro-sarcoma. As a broad rule, it may be said that the beuignancy of the groAvth will be in proportion to the perfection of the de- velopment of the tissue of which it is composed. a. Fatty Tumour or Lipoma.—These tumours constitute an important class of surgical diseases, as they occur A'ery extensively in almost every part of the body, and at all ages, though they are most commonly met Avith about the earlier periods of middle life. In the majority of cases they appear to originate without any evident cause ; in other instances they can be distinctly traced to pressure or to some local irritation, as to that of braces or shoulder-straps over the back and shoulders. In one case I have known the disease to be here- ditarily transmitted to the members of three generations of a fiimily. Fatty accumulations take place under two forms, one diffused, the other circumscribed; it is the latter variety only that is termed the Adipose or Fatty Tumour. The diffused form of fatty deposition occurs in masses about the chin or nates without constituting a disease, though it may occasion much disfigiun- ment. This form Avas described by Brodie under the name of “ latty outgroAvth.” Fatty or adipose tumours may fom in all parts of the body as soft, indolent, inelastic, doughy SAvellings, sometimes giving rise on manipulation to a feeling closely resembling fluctuation. They groAV very sloAvly, and are usually OA'al or round in form, but frequently lobulated to a most extraordinary degree.747 FATTY TUMOURS. rpi npnr most frcquontlv ill the subcutaneous fat about the neck and .1 Ipi-s and are occasionally met with between or even in muscles, in t e ^ 1 Vnnrl of ioints and of serous membranes and of mucous canals, some- S.wths would »carocly bo looked for Tlras I removed some time since a lipoma three mebes in eng i, ani thick as the thumb, from under the annular ligament and the palmar fascia ot a vomm ivomaii.

It is inclosed in a fine thill capsule ha^'ing small vessels ramifying oi'er its sur- face. This capsule is adherent to the surrounding structures, but loosely connected unth the tumour itself, so that, in ope- rating for the removal of these gi’owths, it is important tho- roughly to open the capsule before attempting to remove the tumour. These tumoiu’S, which pre- sent the least possible devia- tion from the normal struc- ture of the parts in which they grow, arc derived from the con- nective tissue by an increased development of fat. They present occasionally some minor varieties of structure. Thus the fibrous tissue may be in excess, giving rise to the so-called “fibrous lipoma,” or the tumour may be permeated by niunerous dilated vessels, as in the “ erectile lipoma.” These conditions arc, however, rare ; occasionally mucous tissue may be found intermixed with the adipose, forming the “ myxo-lipoma.” d'his will be again mentioned under myxoma. In the Treatment of fatty tumours little can be done except by extirpation with the knife, by ■which the patient is speedily and effectually rid of the disease. The tumour, being cncapsuled and but loosely adherent to adjacent parts, readily tunis out if the capsule be fr-cely opened. Great care must be Fig. 27(3.—Fatty Tumour (1S8 diam.)

The ui L.

J n healthy areolar tissue two kinds of fibres are almost invariably present: the white fibrous and the yellow elastic tissue. In tumours composed of fibrous tissue, similar variations in density are found. Thus we have fibrous timioiirs as dense in structure as ligaments, and others as loose as areolar tissue, but in all it is extremely uncommon to find any yellow elastic fibres. Fibrous tissue enters very largely into the composition of many tumours besides the true fibro- mata. Thus the stroma of most cancers is composed of fibrous tissue, the intercellidar substance of a sarcoma may be abundantly fibrous, and in a h'poma the lobules of fat are bound together by areolar tissue. The term fibroma is, howci er, only applied to those tiimoius in which fibrous or areolar tissue forms by far the most abundant constituent, and in which the cells are not of an epithelial type and are not arranged in definite groups. As before stated, no sharp line can be di-awn between fibroma and sarcoma, and the term fibro- sarcoma is frequently applied to those tumours in the border-land between the two. Fibromata may be divided into two chief classes :—1. Soft fibromata, areolar tumours, and fibro-ceUular tumours; 2. Firm fibromata, desmoid tumours, and fibroid tumours. 1. Soft Fibromata.—These may be diffused or circumscribed and encap- suled. The diffused variety or areolar tumours are little more than a simple h}q>erplasia of the subcutaneous>or submucous areolar tissue. They are repre- sented by pendidous fleshy growths, forming large tumours, commonly called Wens, which may occur on any part of the surface. They are smooth, pedun- culated, firm, somewhat doughy, but non-elastic, pendidous, and movable, slowly increasing without pain often to a very great size. They are thinly covered with skin, bearing abmidant papiUre, and sometimes enlarged sweat- glands and hair-foUicles. Large vessels may ramify on the surface, and occa- sionally the skill is pigmented. They are sometimes congenital. In the disease known as molliiscmn fibrosiim these tumours form pedunculated masses or rolls, hauging from the skin of the buttocks, thighs, and other parts of the body, and may attain such a size as seriously to inconvenience the patient by their Aveight. These masses are composed merely of connectiA’e tissue, sometimes dry and tough, and sometimes oedematoiis. They contain large blood-vessels, fr’eqiiently of such size as to render removal of the groivtli a most hazardous operation. A somewhat similar condition is seen in the disease knoivn as Flephautiasis Arabum, in Avhich the skin and areolar tissue ot the affected part undergoes an enormous hypertrophy ; but the neiv groAvth in this case is not pedunculated, and is moreoi'er distinctly connected with repeated attacks of inflammation of the lymphatic vessels of the part. It is in warm climates and749 SOFT FIBROMATA. in the Hindoo and ncgi-o races that this disease attains its greatest devclopmen . It chiefly attacks the genitals, the liypertrophy affecting the skin and arcolai tissue of the scrotum and penis in the male, forming an enormous mass httj, seventy, or e^-en a hundred pounds in weight, or depending from the labia m the female. The remarkable enlargement of the leg occurring m the Mauritius and some parts of the West Indies, and hence termed Barbadoes leg, is an affection of this kind. The skin in these cases becomes dark coloured, rough, and scaly, like that of an elephant, whence the name of the disease. It should perhaps be classed rather nith diseases of the lymphatic system than mth tumours properly so called. In the Treatment of these affections, pressure and iodine applications may be tried in the earlier stages, with the view, if possible, of checking theii gTOwth ; at a later period they must, if large, be removed by operation, though this procedure is at times an extremely severe one, owing to their great size. Timioiu'S of the circumscribed variety, described by Paget as fibro-cellular, are not of common occurrence ; and when met with they are most frequently found in the serotum, the labium, the deep muscular interspaces of the thigh or axilla, and on the scalp, in ivhich situation they may form large masses, attaining some- times to a weight of many pounds. Tnien seated in the subcutaneous tissue these tumours may become peduncidated, as in the accom- panying figiue (277), which represents a tumour of this kind which I removed from the side of a woman. I have removed one weighing nearly foiu pounds fi-om the axilla of a woman, where it lay between the seiTatus magnus and the ribs, forming a tumour of great size. MTien they occiu about the scrotum and labiimi, these tumoiu’s must not be confoimded with elephantiasis of these parts, fi’om which they may be distinguished by being limited and cir- cumscribed masses, and not mere outgrowths. Paget observes that, when occiuTing about the genital organs, they are found in young women and in old men. They happen only in adults who otherwise are in good health, and grow quickly, forming soft, clastic, rounded, and smooth tumours ; they are not attended by any pain. After removal they are found to iiosscss a thin capsule, to be of a yellowish colour, and to contain a large quantity of infiltrated serous fluid, Avhich may be squeezed out abundantly, and coagulates on standing. This fluid may be so abundant as to give rise to distinct fluctuation. Thus, a few years ago, I removed a soft fibroma from amongst the short muscles of the thmnb, which had been previously treated unsuccessfully by puncture, under the impression that it was cystic in nature. Under the microscope these tumours display a beautifully delicate nct- Fig. 27".—Peiululoxis Fibro-ccllular Tumoiu'.TUMOURS. 75° work of wliitc fibrous tissue, arrano-ed in undulating filaments and fibrous bands, in the midst of wliicli stellate, spindle-sliaped, oval or round cells are found. These cells are similar to those normally found in fully developed or growing fibrous tissue. They vaiy in abundance, but never e.xcced the fibrous tissue in amount. The cells are rendered more apparent by the addition of acetic acid.^ These timiours sometimes appear to grow rapidly, when, in reality, the increase in size is due to a rapid increase of the fluid, and not to a new deposit of a solid character in the tumour. As these tumours are per- fectly hinocent, no hesitation need be entertained about their remoi'al. “* ^ ribi. oiiia/tai ribroid. ov Desiuoid Tumours.—These tumours are met with in various situations, the most common of which are the bones and periosteum, the mamma, the subcutaneous connective tissue, and in connection with nerves. In the uterus “ fibroid ” tumoins are exceediugly common, but in this situation they contain not only fibrous tissue, but also a variable nmount of non-striated muscular fibre. Amongst the best known examples ■of firm fibromata may be enumerated, the simple or fibrous epulis, the fibrous tumoiu’S of the antrum or lower jaw, the fibrous polypus of the nose, the ordinary or false neuroma, and the painful subcutaneous tubercle. Fibrous tumom-s are also seen in the neck, especially in the parotid region. In shape these tumours are irregularly oval or rounded ; they are smooth, painless, •and except when growing from bone they are freely movable ; they grow slowly, but may attain an enormous size, equal to that of a cocoa-nut or water-melon. Liston removed one from the neck, which is at present in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, that weighed twelve pounds ; they have, however, been found weighing as much as seventy pounds. They are almost invariably single ; they are excessively firm and hard, but yield shghtly on pressure, in this differing from bony tumours. When cut into, they present Fi"s 27S ■’79 —Firm fibrmnata (ISS di.am.) Figure 279, from a small Fibroma of the forehead, shews Oie (dreidar ar’rangemciit of tlie libres. Figure to the left, from a naso-pharyiigeal rolypus, resemhles ordiuai-y iibrous tissue. a white glistening fibrous structure, often showing, to the naked eye, bundles of interlacing fibres. Sometimes the fibres show a concentric arrange- ment (Fig. 279) ; an aj^pearance which, according to Bilhoth, is due to the fibrous formation taking i^lace around nerves and vessels. On microscopic751 FIBROMATA. examination, pure fibromata are found to be composed of interlacing bundles of Avliite fibrous tissue, scattered amongst which are cells, few iii number, and spindle-shaped, stellate, or oval in form (Fig. 278). These ai-e often oidy rendered apparent by the addition of acetic acid. In most cases the Acssels are not abundant, but frcciuently these tumoins can be shown by in- jection to be very vascular. Sometimes coarse cavernous spaces may be found. The vessels are intimately adherent to the fibrous structure of the tumour, and consequently, being unable to contract or retract, they pour out enormous quantities of blood if opened by wound or ulceration. This is especiaUy_ the case in those fibrous tumours which grow from the bones of the head or face, as in the fibrous polypi growing from the body of the sphenoid bone. Haemor- rhage is moreover often a marked symptom of fibroid tumours of the uterus. ^ Fibromata form most commonly about middle life, and may remain stationary for years, and this is the condition in which they are often pre- sented to the Surgeon. They may, however, suffer various anatomical changes. They may undergo disintegration, becoming oedematous, and softening in the centre, or at various points of the circumference ; they then break down into a semi-fluid mass, the integuments covering them inflame and slough, and imhealthy pus, mixed vdth disorganised portions of the tumour, is poured out, leaving a large and sloughy chasm, from which fimgating growths may sprout, readily bleeding on the slightest touch, and giving the sore a malig- nant appearance ; the patient eventually falling into a cachectic condition, and becoming exhausted by the hmmorrhage and discharge. In other cases these tumoiu’S may calcify, or more rarely undergo true ossification. In rare cases the central parts of these tumom'S may undergo a process of softening, so as to form large cysts containing fluids of various shades of colour. Paget relates the case of a very large cyst of this kmd formed by the hollowing out of a fibroid tumom of the uterus, which was tapped by mistake for ovarian dropsy. Some of the forms of fibroma require fiuther mention here, though they will be again mentioned under the diseases of the organs in which they occur. Fibromata of Bone.—These may grow from the centre of the bone, as is not uufrequently seen in the lower jaw, or from beneath the periosteum. The diagnosis between these latter and the firmer varieties of sarcoma can only be made after removal. Virchow lays great stress upon the fact that periosteal fibromata do not penetrate into the structm’e of the bone, or show any ten- dency to infiltrate the suiTounding soft parts, while the reverse is the case wdth the sarcomata. Fibromata of Nerves.—These are commonly spoken of as neuromata, although this term Avould be more properly limited to those tumours in AA^hich newly formed nerve-filaments are found. They form rounded tumours, over Avhich the fibres of the nerve are stretched; they are fr’equently multiple, sometimes extremely numerous, very hard and dense, and almost invariably painless, and not affecting the function of the nerve upon Avhich they groAV. They are ahvays more movable in a direction transverse to the course of the nerve upon Avhich they are seated than in any other ; a symptom which is of some importance in their diagnosis.752 TUMOURS. Fibromata of Glands arc rare, l)eiii(>- almost confinotl to tlio mammm. Painful Subcutaneous Tubercle is a peculiar form of fibroma, found beneath the skin, usually of one of the extremities, and very rarely of tlic trunli. It is seldom inoie than half an inch in diameter, and is so small as scarcely to cause a prominence on the surface, yet it gives rise to pain of the most intense and agonizing character, usually called forth by some slight touch or pressiu’e, and then lasting perhaps for an horn- or more. These tumours are not neuro- mata ; at any rate, no connection has as yet been traced between them and nerve-filaments. They are by far more ft-equent in females than in males. Fibroid Tumour of the Uterus.—These timioiu’s, as before stated, arc not pure fibromata. In addition to the fibrous tissue, such as is found in pure fibromata, they present numerous long spindle-shaped cells, which were shown by A^irchow to be involuntary muscular fibre cells, and consequently these tumours arc classed by many-writers under “ myomata ” or “ myofibromata.” In the tumours of old women these muscle-cells frequently undergo atrophy, and the tumour then presents the aiDpearance of a pure fibroma. Fibroid tumours of the uterus either project into the cavity of the organ, forming uterine polypi, or into the ca-rity of the pelvis. They are liable to softening and ulceration, accompanied by much hemorrhage when they assume the poly- poid form. Under any circumstances they frequently calcify, and occasionally, as above stated, soften, forming enormous cysts. Somewhat analogous tumom-s are found in the prostate gland in the male. The Treatment of fibromata is in a great measure palliative ,* but when they are so situated as to admit of removal, as in the neck, lower jaw, antrum, mamma, or subcutaneous tissue, they should always be extirpated. Tumours closely resembling fibromata in naked eye appearance and con- sistence, have been kno"\^Ti to reciu’ after removal with much tendency to ulceration, sloughing, and hmmoiThage. They may even give rise to secon- dary deposits in internal organs. These tumours mil always be found on microscopic examination to present the signs of one of the forms of sarcoma to be described hereafter. Pure fibromata are invariably benignant. c. Enchoiidroma — Chondroma — Cartilaginous Tumours.— These tumours have been carefully studied by Muller, and investigated by Paget. They form an exceedingly interesting group, being of comparatively frequent occm-rence, and sometimes assuming a large size. In stmctiu’e, enchondroma may closely resemble normal cartilage (Fig. 279), either of the hyaline or fibrous variety. The cells vary much in size and shape. In the most typical form they are large (-^ to inch), round, oval, or polygonal in shape, and containing a single large nucleus and nucleolus, and sometnnes inclosed in a capsule as in normal cartilage. Occasionally the cells are found to be iiTegular in shape and branched, the processes of one cell communicating with those of another, as in a myxoma. This form re- sembles the cartilage normally found only in the cuttle-fish. The matrix may be hyaline, as in normal foetal or articidar cartilage, or fibrillatcd. It varies mrrch irr derrsity, occasiorrally beirrg so soft as to give the trrmour a false serrse of fiirctuation. This softrress is rrsrrally fourrd irr the more rapidly gTO-wing varieties. The tumour may corrsist of a sirrgle rrrass of cartilage, or may be composed of inrrumerablo lobules, borrrrd together by a ascirlar barrds of753 OJ UTILA GIXO US TUM0 URS. filmms tissue. It is this vascularity that often forms the most striking diiference bot^veen normal cartilage and enchondroma. Its surface may he covered by a distinct fibrous layer, sharply limiting it from the sm-rounding tissues, or the mass of cartilage may be surrounded by a vasenhar zone of embryonic tissue, sometimes composed of round, and sometimes of spindle-shaped cells ivhich may infiltrate and invade the siuToiinding structures.

Thus they may luidergo true ossification. The ordinary pedunculated or spongy exostosis is usually found to be covered ivith a thick layer of cartilage, so that it might be spoken of as an ossifying •enchondroma. Calcification is a far more common change than true ossifica- tion (Fig. 279). Not iinfreqiieiitly mucous softening takes place in the matrix. The cells in this condition float free in the fluid, and undergo de- generation, becoming filled with large globules of fat. This mucous softening may be so extensive as to give the once solid tumour the appearance of a thick- walled cyst. In a case of a very large enchondroma of the ribs under my eare a few years ago, I was enabled to make the diagnosis by microscopic ex- amination of a small quantity of such fluid, removed by means of the aspirator. Cartilage may also be found mixed in one tumour with other structiuns. Thus the cartilagijious tumours of the parotid region are seldom, if ever, pure, but contain mingled together the structru’es of myxoma, adenoma, and ■ enchon- droma. Enchondroma and sarcoma are not infrequently found combined. Enccphaloid cancer and enchondroma are said to have been fomid combined in the testis. Cartilaginous tumours may appear mider two distinct forms; most commonly as innocent growths, but in other cases assuming a malignant tendency and appearance. These two forms present dificrent signs. In the first case, the enchondroma occurs as a hard, smooth, elastic, ovoid, round, or flattened tumour, often nodulated, of small or but of moderate size, seldom exceeding that of an orange, and growing slowly without pain. In the second form, it approaches in its character to malignant disease, growing with extreme rapidity, VOL. I. 3 c754 TUMOURS. attaining- an enormous size mthin a few months, and contaminating the system by the deposit of secondary enchondromatous gi-OAvths in intenial owmns • in these circumstances, it Avonld ai^pear to have occasionally been mistaken'for the rapidly spreading forms of encephaloid disease. The infectino- variety will always be found to be surrounded by a zone of soft embryonic tissue. When these groAvths attain a large size and soften as aboA'e described, the skin covering them mgy become duskily inflamed, eventually slough, and form fistulous openings, through which a thin jelly-like matter is discharged. In some cases it would appear that large tumom-s of this description, softening in the centre, and becoming elastic and semi-fluctuating, have been mistakeirfor cysts, and have been tapped on this supposition. In small enchondromata the opposite condition more frequently occurs, the tumom- becoming indurated, and undergoing ossification. ^ Locality. Most frequently enchondroma occims in connection with some bone. It is most fteqnent in the metacai-pus and phalanges of the fingers (Figs. 282, 283). It is rare, in this situation, to find only one bone or phafanx affected; the tumours are almost invariably multiple. They form hard or elastic rounded knobs, seldom larger than a ivalnut or a pigeon’s egg. They never ossify, but not unfrequently calcify. Large enchondromata are most commonly met ivith in or upon the head of the tibia or the condyles of the femim, foi-ming in these situations rapidly increasing growths of considerable magnitude. Enchondi-omata also are found on the ribs and bones of the pelvis, in the inteimuscnlar spaces of the neck, thigh, and leg ; in connection with the sheaths of tendons, and occasionally in glands ; but in this last situation they are seldom, if ever, ixme, being mixed Avith myxoma, adenoma, or sarcoma, and it is said by some, occasionally with carcinoma. It is a curious fact, that enchondromata never arise in connection Avith pre-existing cartilage. When coimected with the bones, enchondroma may spring from the rig. 2S2. —Large Encliraulroma of Index Finger. Fig. 2S3.—Ordinary Enchoudroina of Finger. periosteum, gi-adually enveloping, absorbing, and eventually destroying, the osseous structures, though at first not incorporated with them. It has then been distinguished as “ perichondroma.” This is its usual mode of oiigin Avhen occurring in the femui* or tibia; Avhen seated on the short bones, especially on the metacai-pus and phalanges (Figs. 282, 283), it cormnonly springs from the intei’ior of the osseous structime, which becomes expanded3 0 2 7SS bony tumours. and absorbed, and is involved in the general mass of the tumour. ^\ hen occurrinf>- in celhdar regions unconnected with bone, the cncliondroma is softer, and does"not present such distinct cartilage-cells as the osseous enchondroma. Most trequcntly these euchondromatous masses occur in childhood, or shortly ifter puberty, appearing to arise from an overgrowth of the cartilaginous element of the osseous system at this period of life. d’he TvBCifviBiit consists cither in excision of the tumour, or in amputation of the affected part. Excision may be practised when the tumour is seated in the parotid region, or otherwise unconnected with bone. When fomiing part of the osseous structures, it cannot well be got rid of without the removal by amputation of the bone that it implicates. When it occurs in the hand, removal of the affected fingers and metacarpal bones, to an extent proportioned to the amount of the disease, Avill be required ; but it should be remembered that in this situation enchondromata are always peifectly innocent, and con- sequently the operation should not be performed if the fingei be useful to the patient, unless he is willing to sacrifice an useful finger to get rid of an unsightly deformity. In Fig. 26 may be seen the kind of hand left after operation in the case ' from which Fig. 283 was taken. If, in these circumstances, excision of the tumour only be attempted, it will be found that the whole mass cannot be removed, and that it rapidly gTOws again ; or that the wound formed by the operation remains fistulous and open. Most commonly a permanent cure is effected by the ablation of the tumour in one or other of these ways ; but cases have occurred amongst the niore rapidly groA\ung varieties of enchondroma, especially when seated in glands, and when the growth is not purely cartilaginous, in which recirrrence has taken place after operation, the secondary tumour being softer than the primary, with a close approximation to malignancy in appearance and action. (cl) Osteoma. Exostosis. Bony Tumour.—In order to render the review of the different varieties of tumour complete, it will be be necessary briefly to mention the osteomata in this place, though their clinical characters will be more fully treated of in the chapter on the Diseases of Bones. In the first place, it is necessary accurately to distinguish mere calcification from the formation of true bone. The former is extremely common, the latter some- what rare. Bone appears in tumours under foiu’ chief conditions ; 1 st, as the result of the ossification of a fibroma ; 2nd, of a sarcoma ; 3rd, of an eu- chondroma; and 4th, as a special growth covered Avith a firm layer of perios- teum. Bone has also been described as occun'ing in connection with carcinoma ; I but this assertion requires confirmation since the separation of sarcoma and carcinoma. Only the last two forms mentioned above are usually spoken of I as bony tumours or exostoses. They differ essentially from each other in their il seat and consistence, as Avell as in their mode of growth. Those developing fr’om j cartilage or spongy exostoses, are situated almost invariably in the inuuediate neighbourhood of an epiphysis, and rarely, if ever, start into growth after the tAvonty-fourth year; those developing from a fibrous periosteal covering, ivory exostoses, are of extreme and remarkable density, and arc usually seated on flat bones, such as those of the head, face, scapula, and pelvis. Both these growths closely resemble normal bone in structure, the spongy exostosis exactly756 TUMOURS. agreeing with the cancellous tissue of the extremity of a long bone, and the ivory or hard exostosis corresponding to the petrous portion of the temporal, • J jJUI VJI UUO LL-lXipUicU J the lower jaw, or the compact tissue of a long bone. Both forms are invariably non-malignant- cl- ^ Spongy E.costoses, sometimes called pedunculated or cauliflower exostoses, iVom their shape, are most common at the upper end of the humerus and the lower end of the femur, and on the ungual phalanx of the great toe (Fig. 284). If observed during the stage of growth, they are found to be covered by a perfectly developed hyaline cartilage, which ap- parently grows from the perichondrium covering it, and quickly undergoes ossification at its deep siuface. If the tumour be observed when all growth has ceased, it will be found to be com- pletely bony, being composed of a pedmiculated mass of cancellous tissue, covered thinly by a layer of compact bone. The cancellous tissue of the tumoim is continuous mth that of the bone upon which it grows, the compact tissue of the shaft being absorbed beneath the base of the tumour. Sometimes these tumours are hereditary and mul- tiple. They scarcely ever reach a gveat size, and probably cease to grow if they become completely ossified. Ivory Exostoses.—These tumours form flat rounded elevations, usually seated about the bones of the skull or face. They are covered with a fibrous mem- brane and are of intense hardness. Occasionally they are multiple and grow to a considerable size, and when seated on the facial bones distort the featiues honibly, and at last after years of sufiering possibly cause death by pressure on the brain. e Myxoma. Mucous Tumour.—These tumoius are classed by some Avriters under sarcomata, as the tissue of which they are composed closely resembles the rudimentary fat of the embryo. In the adult, the vitreous body of the eye is the only part in which mucous tissue is nonnally found. _ Many tiunom’S formerly described as coUoid cancer belong properly to this class. Myxomata usually foim round, oval, or lobulated masses, distinctly siuTomided by a loose capsule of comiectiye tissue. They are tense, elastic, and gelatinous, finquently giving rise to a sense of fluctuation so distinct as to lead to then- being mistLn for cysts. They are usually of slow growth On section they are found to be of a delicate pink colom-, sometimes stained by hmmoiihages, or they may present an uniform yeUowish tint.

The round cells vai-y in size and are distinct from the branched ones. The branched cells are reiy ir- regular, and the' matrix somewhat fibrous. fibrous tissue, sometimes containing yeUo'W elastic fibres. The stellate cells may be smaUer in some cases than in others. The peculiar featiue of the growth is the mucous intercellular substance, and wdthout this being present no tumour should be called a myxoma. Frequently tissue agreeing in all respects with that of a pure myxoma is found mixed with that of sarcoma, enchondroma, or adenoma. These tumours are spoken of as myxo-sarcomata, myxo-chondromata, &c. Myxo-chondroma, frequently containing portions of adenoma, forms the ordinary parotid tumoiu’. Occasionally a development of true fat-cells may take place in the central parts of a myxoma, thus indicating, as Virchow thinks, the relation of these tumoiu’S to embryonic fat. A few years ago I saw in consultation a case of an enormous abdominal tumour, which proved on examination after death to be a pure myxoma, weighing at least thirty pounds, the central parts of which contained an abundance of true adipose tissue. Such tumoiu’s as these have been spoken of as myxo-lipomata. Myxo- mata may occur in any part of the body. When superficial they often assimic a poljqioid form, as in the ordinary mucous polypus of the nose (Fig. 280). Myxo- mata are not unfrequent in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, in nerves they foiTii one variety of false neiuoma, and they are occasionally met with in glands. IMyxomata are usually absolutely non-maliguant, but occasionally they recur locally after removal. If left untreated, they may cause death by ulceration of the skin taking place OA'er them, leading to sloughing of the tumour with pro- fuse haemorrhage aud foul discharge. Occasionally they may prove fatal from pressure on important organs, as in the case of the abdominal tumour above mentioned. The Treatment consists in the remo'^’al of the growth whencA'er an operation is possible.TU2WURS. 75S III. TUMOUBS WHICH KEBEMBLE IN STRUCTURE, MORE OR LESS PERFECTLY ONE OP THE MORE COMPLEX TISSUES OP THE BODY A. Myoma. Muscular Tumour.—Tliese tumours are of two classes ; those containing striated and those containing non-striated muscular fila-c. Striated muscular fibre has, at present, only been found in a fcAv congenital tumours, and is merely a pathological curiosity. Non-striated muscular fibre is found in abundance, as before-mentioned, in the so-called fibroid tumoui's of the uterus (see p. 732), and of the prostate, but it is always associated with large cpiantities of fibrous tissue, so that the tumour is more properly spoken of as a myo-fibroma. The older tinnours are found to be composed almost entirely of fibrous tissue, the muscular fibre-cells haying undergone atrophy. Pure myomata have, in very rare cases, been found in connection Avith the oesopha- gus. Fagge has recorded an interesting case of this, which was accidentally discovered after death, at Guy’s Hospital. It gave rise to no symptoms during life, although the tumoim Avas as large as a good sized egg. Myomata are ahvays non-malignant. B. Neuroma. True Neuroma. Nervous Tumour.—The term neuroma is chnically applied to any tumoiu- groAving on a neiwe, whether it be a fibroma, myxoma, sarcoma, or true neuroma. The term should strictly be hmited to those tumours in Avhich there is an actual new groAvth of nervous tissue. Tumom's containing ncAvly formed nervous tissue are rare. Neuromata com- posed of gTey matter (non-medullated fibres and g-anglionic tissue), haA'e been described, but they are so infinitely rare, that they need no fm-ther mention here. The vast majority of true neinomata are composed of bundles of meduUated or Avhite nerve fibres, interlacing Avith each other, or sometimes rolled up into masses, and separated by connectiA’e tissue, more or less rich in small cells. True neuromata occur only in connection AA'ith nerves. The bulbous extremities of nerves, often seen in stumps after amputation, are said by Valentin, Lebert, and others, to be specimens of true neuromata. True neiu’omata occur also without preAdous injury of the nerve. They are then frequently multiple. They are not diagnosable in any Avay from other firm tumours of nerves. They are sometimes painful and tender, and sometimes not. The most characteristic sign of any tumour seated on a nerve is, that Avhen the nerve upon which it is seated is put on the stretch by the position of the part, the tumour is almost immovable in a direction parallel to the coiuse of the nerA'e, while it is more or less freely movable in the transA'erse direction. True neuromata are always non-mahgnant, and should not be interfered AAuth in any way unless they give rise to serious inconvenience from pain. 0. Angioma. Vascular Tumour.-—Under the name of angiomata • are included only such tumours as are composed of vascular tissue of new growth, and not such swellings as arise from the dilatation of pre-existing vessels. The so-called cirsoid aneiuism, or aneurism by anastomosis, being supposed to be due chiefly to a dilatation of pre-existing arteries, although doubtless accom- panied by some ucav formation of A'cssels, is not usually included amongst angiomata, nor are the SAA-ellings formed by coiiA'olutcd masses of varicose A'eins. True angiomata are usually diA'ided into tAvo classes : m angioma or telangiectasis, and the cavernous angioma. The angioma is composed of a mass of tortuous and dilated capillaries bound together by759 L YMPHADENOMA. connective tissue. The blood vessels comprising it arc normal in stiuctmc. This forms the ordinary superficial ntevus, mother’s mark, or port-wine stain. It is, probably, always congenital. The cavernous angioma, or erectile tumoui, resembles in structure the corpus cavernosum penis, being made up by spaces, communicating freely with each other. The walls of the spaces are composed of fibrous tissue, and are lined with an endothelium resembling that of a vein Fi?. 2S7.—Nffivus. A. ,1S8 aiiim.) inliltniting fat.

Some of the cells have been removed to show the arrangement of the stroma. h (188 diam.), shows general an-angement. (Fig. 287). These tumours are sometimes distinctly circumscribed, and enclosed ill a loose capsule of connective tissue ; in other cases they are diffuse. They arc rarely if ever congenital, usually arising in young adult life. They are most common in the siibcutaneoiis tissue, but have also been met with in the liver, spleen, and other internal organs. The mode of origin of these tiimoiu’S is doubtful. The symptoms and treatment of vascular tiimoiu’S vdll be fidly described in a subsequent chapter. 1). Lymphangioma, Tumour composed of Lymphatic Vessels. These excessively rare tumours are composed of dilated lymphatic vessels communicating with each other, like the spaces of the ca’^'ernoiis angioma, the cavities containing lymph instead of blood. Yirchow has described them as occiiiTing congenitally in the tongue, forming one variety of hypertrophy of that organ (macroglossia). They are also said to have been seen forming pale, compressible, congenital tumom-s of the skin. E. Lymphadenoma. Tumour composed of Lymphatic Tissue. Lymphoma.—Lymph adenomata are composed of tissue exactly resembling that of the follicles of the lymphatic glands, lymphoid or lymphatic tissue, the .so-called “adenoid tissue ” of His; but to avoid confusion, the term “ adenoid” should never be used in connection with this structure, but reserved for tissues resembling those of the secreting glands. Lymphoid tissue (Fig. 288) is characterised by a delicate reticulate stroma, in the meshes of which arc packedTUMOURS. 7C0 iminbcrlcss colls, in ovory way resembling the white corpuscles of the blood. 1 he stroma is composed of fibrous tissue containing a few oval nuclei scattered through It, especially where the bands cross each other. The stroma may, in some cases, be increased in amount and thicker than that normally found in lymphatic glands. The -^-essels are abundant and in close connection with the stroma. To the naked eye these tumours are white in colour, sometimes- stained by hemorrhages. They are soft and often brain-like, and, from the readiness Avith Avhich the cells are separated from the stroma, they may yield a milky juice on scraping. Thus they closely resemble cncephaloid cancer in appearance. They vary in size from a pin’s head to a foetal head. They are sometimes circiiuAscribed, as when they are situated in a lymphatic gland and have not extended beyond its capsule, but more usually they are diffuse. They occur at any age, but are most common in young adult life. They usually grow in connection with pre-existing lymphoid tissue, and, as this has been shomi to be Avidely disseminated through the body, they may occur at almost any part. Lymph adenomata are chiefly found in connection Avith the diseases kuoAviA as leucocythEemia, or that called “ cuUnie ” by Trousseau. The former of these is characterised by a great increase of white coi-puscles in the blood, Avith anaemia and general debility, and the latter by the presence of the tumours without these symptoms being present. For the symptoms of these diseases, the reader must refer to works on Medicine. The tumours form in the lymphatic glands, hver, spleen, kidneys and other organs, and they have been occasionally met AAuth in bones. They most commonly come under the observation of Surgeons Avhen situated in the lymj)hatic glands or bones. The glands of the neck and axilla are most frequently affected. They form painless swellings, usually Arm in consistence, slowly growing, and are at fii’st indistinguishable from simple chronic inflammatory enlargement. As they increase in size the glands fuse together, forming large nodular masses. They shoAV no tendency to soften or suppurate. After a time they may cease to grow. In the thorax such tnmoius may cause death by pressure, and the same has been said to occiu in the neck. Prom what has been above said, it is evident that the diagnosis of these growths from simj)le hypertrophy or chronic inflammation of lymphatic glands, is in the early stages a matter of great difficulty. The great number of the tumours, the absence of any source of local in-itation, and the fusing together of the enlarged glands, are im- portant signs in the later stages, accompanied by the symptoms of general AA'Cakness. If the glands cease groAAnng and the general health be fairly good, the tumours may be remoA'ed by operation. In other cases, constitutional treatment alone must be relied upon. A fcAV years ago I removed a tinnoim of this kind, as large as a flst, from the axilla of a woman aged 30. She had also a chain of enlarged glands in the neck. She suffered from some debility, but had no excess of white corpuscles in the blood, or enlargement of the spleen. P. Papilloma. Tumour resembling the Papillae of Skin or Mucous Membrane.—A papilla is a more or less pointed projection composed of areolar tissue, surrounding a capillary loop and co\‘ered by epithelium, AAdiich may consist of many layers, as in the skin, or ot only one as in the intes- tine. Lymphatic spaces or capillaries are also normally present in the areolar761 ririLLOMA: COHNS AND WARTS. ■'I’lio tiimoui-s which pass under the name of papillomata are usually livuertrophies of the normal papilla of the part on which they grow, auc nre covered by the variety of epithelium normal to the part, ihe papi as 0 Avhich they are composed differ from those normal to the part m size, shape •md vascularity. Thus, instead of merely microscopic papilhe, such fis liormal to the skin, we may have growths sometimes reaching the size and pie- sentiiio- the appearance of the head of a good-sized cauliflower. Instead of simpkpapilhe, we may have branched growths snbdisiding aginn and again and connected with the parent tissue only by a narrow stalk Ihe vessels of these «n-owths are always abundant, and frequently dilated to a consideiable size “idle connective tissue forming the basis of the papillm is more or less crowded with sniaU round cells, according to the rapidity of the growUi. Sometimes the deeper layers of the epitheliimi are darkly pigmented. Malig- nant tumours of various kinds when seated on a free surface may assume a papillary form, but these must not be confounded with papillomata. On the other hand, a papilloma may by im-isible degrees merge into an epithelioma or adenoid cancer, as the case may be, the distinction betAveen them sometimes not being possible, even Avith the help of the microscope. It may, hoAAeAei, be broadly stated that so long as the tmnour maintains a simple papillary form, the epithelium being purely superficial, and shoAving no tendency to biuTOw betAvecn the papillie into deeper parts, and so long as the base of the tumom- is not composed of masses of small round ceUs infiltrating the siuTounding structures, Ave may at least hope that the tumoiu- is non-mahgnant. In other cases, such as the common Avarts or gonorrheal Avarts, we knoAV certainly that the gi’OAA'th is simple. Papillomata A'ary in hardness and softness, according to the parts on Avhich they grow, and the amount and nature of epithelium with Avhich they are covered. Thus the common corn or Avart, being thickly covered AA’ith horny epithehum is hard, while the papillomata of the rectum, being thinly coA'cred AA-ith columnar epithelium, are ahvays soft. The chief forms of papilloma are :—corns, simple warts, condylomata, and mucous tubercles, and some forms of polypi and villous tumom-s. Corns consist of an undue development of cuticle, with a slight increase of the vascularity of the subjacent cutis ; subsequently the papillae themselves become enlarged, especially when the irritation has been prolonged or consider- able. A soft corn is merely one Avhich from its situation is kept constantly moist, so that the ncAvly formed scaly epithelium, instead of forming a dense crust, peels offl leaving the vascular and sensitive papiUae but thinly covered. Warts afe the result of a primary hypertrophy of the papillae, accompanied by the formation of noAv vessels, and leading to a great increase in the deA'elop- ment of the epidermis, Avhich forms laminated strata, and sometimes produces masses Avith a concentric arrangement of the cells, closely resembling the nest- like stnictimes seen in epithelioma. The true warts are most commonly found on the skin, and are then often A'ery hard and horny ; sometimes they may develope a long hom-like groAvth. Softer varieties are, hoAveA'er, found on the muco-cutaneous surfaces, especially of the prepuce and vulva, and are usually of a specific origin. They may also occur on the mucous membrane of the mouth or soft palate. Warts may be the result of a local irritation, but in many cases they appear to depend as much upon some constitutional condition.TUMOURS. 762 The ™-ty growths from the vulva, as tlic result of g„„oiThcoal iiritation, m.iy reach tlie size ol a ioctal head.

Ill Condylomata and -Mucous Tubercles the enlarged papillte are soft, and contain a great abimdance of small round cells, giifing evidence of their rapid growth. They occm- about the anus and in the perinteum aud folds of the nates, as ivell as occasionally in the larynx and fauces. They are always dependent on a syphilitic taint. When situated on the mucous membranes, they are often pointed, somewhat pendulous or nodulated on the sin-face, I'ery A'ascnlar, and bleed readily Avhen touched ; but when they occur on a mneo- entaneous siu-face, they are flattened, expanded, soft, and ivhite, constituting the true condylomata or mucous tubercles. Some forms of polypi are properly classed amongst papillomata. Thus the simple polyiins of the rectum may be a soft papilloma bearing columnar epithe- lium. In some rare cases, the epithelium has been found to be scaly. The papilbn may branch again and again, the peduncle being comparatii-ely small. It is difficult, hoAvever, to draAV any accurate line between such papillomata * and the adenoid cancer to he described hereafter. The common form of villoua tumour of the bladder, frequently described as “ aIIIous cancer,” should also nndouhtedly he included under papillomata. This tmnom- is composed of long delicate processes floating freely in the caA’ity of the bladder, attached only at their bases. They each consist of a dilated capillary loop, sniToniidcd by an almost liomogencons conncctiA'C tissue, containing a few scattered round or oval cells, and coA'ered Avith an epithelium of an irregular shape, often resembling spiudle-cells in form, and similar to that naturally lining the bladder. This epitheliiun is A'cry difficult to find, as it soon separates by maceration in the urine after death. The base fr'om Avhieli the A'illi groAv isADENOMA OR GLANDULAR TUMOUR. 7^3 composed merely of fibroid tissue tuuuelled in tdl directions by dilated vessels. These tumours, if left unrelieved, im-ariably terminate fatally from the abundant hmmoiThage to which they gi\'o rise, and the effect they have in interfering with the escape of urine from the bladder ; but they ne^•er give rise to secondary deposits or imnde siiiTounding structures, and are consequently non-mahgnant. They will be more fully described under diseases of the bladder. The o-cneral principles of Treatment of these affections consist in their removaf by excision, ligatme, or caustics, according to their size, situation, and attachments. Excision is usually preferable when they arc seated on mucous surfaces ; the ligature should be used if they be hnge and pendulous ; and caustics should be employed when they arc seated on the skin or a muco- cutaneous surface. The term “polypus ” may perhaps be more conveniently defined here than elsewhere. It is purely clinical, and has no pathological meaning. It merely means a tumour growing from the mucous surface lining a ca'\ity, haAdng a distinct peduncle and a rounded, oval, or papillary form. Thus the ordmary l^olyiAUS of the nose is usually a myxoma, and. the malignant polypus a sarcoma. Polypus of the uterus is a fibroma or myofibroma, and polypus of the rectum often a papilloma, and sometimes a form of cancer. Simple polypi are usually coA'ered by a prolongation of the mucous membrane from which they grow. Thus the mucous polypus of the nose is covered by a membrane bearing ciliated epithehum. Adenoma. Glandular Tumours. Pancreatic Sarcoma. Lobular Hypertrophy of Glands, &c.—These tumours resemble secreting glands in structm-e. Secreting glands are racemose or tubular, and consequently many Avriters diAide adenomata into two corresponding classes. The Tubular Adenomata are composed of masses of tubules resembling the crypts of Lieberkfihn, some closed and some open on the surface. They are usually papillary, and seated on some parts of the intestine. They often form jDoljqAoid tumoiu’s. When simple and with well marked papilla3, they might 2)crhaps be more properly spoken of as paj)illomata, and they AAnre consequently mentioned under that class. When shoA\'ing the well marked malignancy so common to these growths, they are perhaps more conveniently classed Avith carcinomata, either under the name of columnar epithelioma or adenoid cancer. They Avill, therefore, be more fully described hereafter. The Hacemose or Acinous Adenomata resemble in structure more or less perfectly a racemose gland, and are found always in connection Avith such organs (Figs. 290, 291). They are composed of rounded or irregular spaces lined Avith a peculiar small epithelium, someAA'^hat square or rounded in form, and fr-equently many layers deep. The spaces comuumicate Avith each other, cither'directly or by means of more or less jAerfect duct-like channels. The acini, Avhich are more or less Avidely separated, are bound together by fibrous tissue, bearing vessels, and containing cells varying in shape and number. In the most typical forms the cells are merely such as are seen in ordinary con- nective tissues ; but if the tumour be groAving rapidly, large numbers of small round or oval cells are found (Fig. 291). Sometimes the tissue betAveen the acini may be composed entirely of spindle-cells, in fact, may haA’e the structiu-e of a spindle-celled sarcoma ; the tumour is then often spoken of as an adeno-764 TVMOUnS. bo found, ze fi'om a Lu oybcic sarcoma ot the mamma, ko growths, similar in stnictnre rig. 2!I0.—Acltiioiiia of Mamma, of slow growth, (1S8 diam.).

Tubes cuiitaiu more than one layer of eiiithelimii. to the rest of the tumour, may be fonncl projecting into the cysts (intracystic growths—proligerous cysts of the mamma). These tumours are infinitely most frequent in the mamma, but they are sometimes seen in connection Avith the parotid, and have been recorded as groAving from the racemose glands of the soft palate, and from the lachrymal gland. In the parotid they are often Fig. 291.—Adenoma of Mamma, rai>id growth (18S diam.).

UNDEBO-OINO- IV.—TUMOURS BRYONIO, OB IS SEEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT SARCOMATA. r-nivr-pn^ED OF TISSUE WHICH IS EITHER PURELY EM- COMPOSED primary modifications OF ADULT CONNECTIVE TISSUE The laro-e «TOup of tumoiu-s now classed together under the name of sarco- mata includes many which were, till comparatively recently, known by a , and grou^ which has now received a definite meaning, was formerly applied to variety of other names, and grouped in other divisions : and the term sar- coma, which has now received a definite meaning, was Ic almost any soft fleshy growth. Thus almost all soft sarcomata of bones, the o-lioma or glio-sarcoma of the eye, sarcomata of secreting glands, and lymphatics, were formerly called soft cancer ; the melanotic sarcoma, melanosis, or melan- otic cancer, and the ossifying sarcoma, osteoid cancer ; many fii’m sarcomata have been described as scirrhus, and soft sarcomata broken down by hmmor- rhao-e as blood-cysts. Lastly, the tumours known as fibro-plastic, fibro-nuclear, recmTcnt fibroid, malignant fibroid, and myeloid, have all been brought into the gTeat class of sarcomata. These tumours may gi'ow in any part of the body. They may present every variety of consistence, colour, and shape , they may be circumscribed or diffuse ; they may be as innocent as a fatty tumoiu’, or as malignant as the worst form of cancer. The anatomical type of sarcoma is found in embryonic tissue, a description of which has been given in a former page (p. 736). Its pathological analogue is seen in the products of inflammation, but between these and sarcoma are many differences. The products of inflammation, supposing they live, show a tendency towards develop- ment into some more perfect tissue ; but in a sarcoma the older parts of the growth show no higher development than the most recent, the same type of structiu'e being as a rule maintained throughout. Inflammatory new growths tend speedily to limit themselves, sarcomata to grow indefinitely. In sarcoma, the individual elements are often larger than those seen in inflammation. The cells of sarcomata vary greatly in shape and size, and it is chiefly according to these variations that this group is subdivided. The cells consist simply of a mass of protoplasm smrounding one or more nuclei, and enclosed in no cell-wall. They may be small and round, exactly res.embling the white corpuscles of the blood, or large and round, looking almost like epithelium- cells ; they may be oval, spindle-shaped or fusiform, stellate or tailed; large mother-cells crammed with nuclei may be found, and occasionally the cells are pigmented. The intercellular substance may be scanty or abundant, homo- geneous or fibrous, but under all circumstances it penetrates between the individual cells in the greater part, if not in the whole of the tmnour, and thus establishes a broad distinction between these growths and carcinomata, in which the stroma forms alveolar spaces, the cells lying free within them. Occasionally the growth may ossify. The blood-v'essels of sarcomata are usually abundant and thin-walled, resembling those of. newly formed granu- lations. This makes these tumours prone to bleed, both into their own sub-766 TU2WUJiS. sbmce ami exton,ally, a„cl maypcri.aps acemmt for the readiness with wl.iel, ..any »,reom,Ua propagate themselves in the direetion of the eire.

On scraping after a section has been made fresh, but after about tvventy-fou^ is It can often be obtained. Some sarcomata are distinctly circumscribed and enclosed m a fibrous capsule, others infiltrate surrounding pX like le caicmomata. Sarcomata are most frequent in youth and middle life. As a ride, it may be said that sarcomata infect the system generally through the mediim of the blood-ve.ssels, ivhile carcinoma is disseminated chiefly by e lymphatic system. This rule has many exceptions, yet nothing is more common than to see secondary gTowths of sarcoma in the lungs, liver, and 0 er orpns, iidthout the lymphatic glands having ever been affected. The reverse is certainly the rule in carcinoma. It may also be bi’oadly stated that the more closely a sarcoma approaches to fidly developed connective tissue in Its structure, the less likely it is to prove malignant; but this rule also is not free fi-oni exceptions. Sarcomata vary greatly in their rate of growth, some proving fatal in less than a year, others lasting many years without attaining any considerable size. Sarcoma-tissue sometimes occurs mixed with other kinds of growth. Varieties OE Sarcojrl—Small Round-celled Sarcoma. Granulation Sarcoma. Encephaloid Sarcoma.—These tumours were fonnerly included among soft or encephaloid cancers. They resemble in structure the superficial layers of granulations, being comjDosed of small round cells about the size of a white blood-corpuscle, or a little larger, each containing a round or oval nucleus, and imbedded in a homogeneous intercellular substance (Fig. 292). Fig. 292.—Round-colled Sarcoma, from a large tumour in the muscles round the upiier end of the femur (188 diam.) The cells vary in size and have a vei-y clear nucleus and nucleolus ; the matrix wliieh has shrank away from the cells is faintly granular.

SriNDLE-CELLED SARCOMA. tiuctly fibrillatcd. The tumour may thus closely resemble a lymphaclenoma, but on careful examination the stroma will be found not to be so clearly reti- cular. These tumours arc soft, sometimes even pulpy, and gi’ey or whitish in colour. They very often infiltrate suiTOunding parts. They arc excessively vascular, and often present scattered patches of hiemorrhage or cysts resulting from extravasation of blood. They yield no milky juice when quite fresh, but when decomposition sets in it can easily be obtained by pressure or scraping. Their chief seats are in the skin, bones, subcutaneous areolar tissue, muscles, and occasionally in glands. Their diagnosis cannot be accurately made till after removal. They show a malignancy equal to that of the worst cancers. Their gi-owth is rapid, and they early give rise to secondary deposits, especially in the limgs, and the lymphatic glands are fr’eqiiently affected. One fonn of small round-celled sarcoma has been described by Virchow under the name of Glioma, from its resemblance in structure to the neuroglia or connective tissue of the brain. It is composed of an excessively delicate areolar stroma, having round cells imbedded in its meshes. These tumours vary much in consistence, being sometimes soft and sometimes quite fimi. They occur almost invariably in connection vdth the nerves or nervous centres. The tiimoiu’ formerly known as soft cancer of the eyeball is in fact a glioma arising fi’om the retina. It is most common in young children, and fr’equently runs a malignant course, projecting beyond the eyeball, infiltrating siuToimding parts, and gfring rise to secondary deposits. Spindle-celled Sarcoma. Fasciculated Sarcoma. Recurrent Fibroid. Tumour. Fibro-plastic Tumour.—These tumours are composed of spindle- shaped, fusiform, or oat-shaped cells, either lying closely in contact with each other or separated by a homogeneous or fibrous intercellular substance (Fig. 293). The cells vary greatly in size in different tumours, but are usually tolerably equal in the same growth. They may be little more than y-oVo-tfr inch in length, or they may reach entirely across the field of the microscope. This has given rise to the distinction between large and small spindle-celled sarcomata. The intercellular substance is usually more abundant and more fully developed into fibrous tissue in the suiall than in the large-celled growths ; and it is the former, therefore, that gradually merge into fibromata, so that it is often difiicult to determine under which heading to class them, and some writers have given them the name fibro-sarcoma. All spindle-cells, large or small, contain an oval nucleus -with one or more nucleoh. The cells are usually arranged in bands crossing each other in various directions, often giving the growth a fasciculated or fibrous appearance. The vessels, as in other sarco- mata, are abundant and thin-waUed. The small simidle-cclled sarcomata are usually firm in consistence, and of a pinkish or white colour, the central parts being yellow fr’om fatty degeneration. Occasionally they contain cysts filled with straw-coloured fluid, and they may closely resemble in aspect the common fibroid tumour. They form by prefer- ence in fibrous structiues, as fascias, skin, or tendons. They may occiu in inter- muscular spaces, or occasionally in the sheaths of neiwes. Thus I amputated the leg a few years ago for a large tumour of this kind seated on the posterior tibial nerve. Though these tumours are usually distinctly circumscribed and sometimes encapsuled, and run a perfectly innocent course, in many cases768 TUMOURS. they show an extraordinary tendency to local reeiirrcncc after removal; but it IS rare for them to give rise to secondary deposits in internal organs.' Pao-et describes these growths under the name of recurrent fibroid tumours, and relates sc\'cral instances of them. One was a tumour of the upper part of the leg, Avhich bet^veen lb4G and the end of 1848 had been remo^■ed five times, and reappeared for the sixth time after the last operation, Avhen, as it had become large and ulcerated, amputation Avas deemed adAosable ; this procedure, hoAvever, was followed by death. The examination of the third tumour pre- sented “ very narrow, elongated, caudate, and oat-shaped nucleated cells, many of Avhich had long and subdivided terminal processes ; ” in the last removed tmnora-, the cells M^ere generally filled with minute shining molecules, as if fatty degeneration had taken place. In another case, a tumour of the shoulder had been removed, and retmmed four times between May, 1848, and December, 1849, reappearing in the following year for the fifth time ; it, however, after a time became stationary, and many years afterwards the patient, l)ut for the presence of the tumoim, might be considered to be a strong and healthy man. Paget also relates a case in which, beDveen 1839 and 1851, Syme removed a tumour of this kind five times from the upper part of the chest: it recurred a sixth time and was followed by death. He also refers to a case by Gluge, in which a similar tumour was five times removed fr-om the scapula, its sixth reappearance being followed by death. The most interesting of all is a case by Maclagan, in which four removals were performed in the course of thirty- six years, twenty-three years inteiTcning between the second and third removals, and eleven between the third and fourth. Since this form of tumour Avas first described by Paget, a number of instances have been recorded by British and continental Surgeons. These recurrent tumours appear to become more mahgnant in the later than in the earlier recuiTences, becoming more painfid, rapidly degenerating, and giAung rise to an ulcerating fungus, which eventually proves fatal by exhaustion and haemorrhage. The cells Avill then be foiuid to have become larger, and the intercellular substance softer and devoid of fibrillation ; and, in fact, they merge into the large-celled form of spindle- celled sarcoma. Lar(je spindle-celled sarcomata, formerly often spoken of as fibro-plastic tumoiu’S, are much softer than the variety last described. They are usually of a pinkish colour, frequently stained dark red in parts fr-om extravasations of blood, and if of any size, their central parts are opaque and yelloAV fr-om the effects of fatty degeneration. They yield more or less transparent viscid juice on scraping, mixed Avith fragments of the growth. They may be distinctly circumscribed and encapsuled, but not infrequently they invade sim-oimding parts. They frequently contain cysts of some size, sometimes filled with straAV-coloined fluid and sometimes with blood or a blood-coloined liquid. These tumoins form frequently in connection with bones, especially conmiencing nnder the periosteiun of the shafts of long bones or about the bones of the face or nose. A few years ago I amputated a thigh at the hip-joint in UniAei- sity College Hospital, 'for a large tumour of this kind growing beneath the periosteum of the femur, and in another case the arm Avas remoAed by Heath for a similar growth. Both had caused spontaneous fracture of the hone, and both ultimately proA-ed fatal fr-om internal deposits. These tumoui-s■,G() lOVAL-GELLED SARCOMA. ^■hen affecting bone, must not be confounded with the myeloid, which they closely resemble. Large spindle-celled sarcomata also grow from fascim and intermuscular spaces, and not unfrecpiently from glands, especially the mamma, and they may be found in rare cases in almost any situation. They very otteii run a malignant course, ginng rise to secondary deposits in internal organs. Their tendency to local recurrence after removal is very great. In some cases the structm-e may somewhat change with repeated recurrences, the later growths always showing signs of more active development and deviating more and more from the normal type of spindle-celled growth, such as is found in the fibroid tissue of cicatrices. This is clearly shovm by a case which occurred under my cai-e at University College Hospital. A tumour as large as a fuU-sized turnip was removed from the shoulder of a middle-aged man, and was found to be slightly connected with the spine of the scapula. On examination, it presented all the characters of a spindle-celled sarcoma, consisting almost entirely of densely packed fusiform cells, with oval or oat-shaped nuclei. A small mass reappeared before the wound had completely healed, and on examination pre- sented a much lai’ger proportion of oval cells and spindle-ceUs, now having double nuclei. It recurred a second time, and now but few Avell-formed spindle-ceUs were found, but the tmnour was chiefly composed of oval and flask-shaped cells, or rather masses of protoplasm, in which numerous nuclei wei’e imbedded. A portion of the spine of the scapula, which was removed with the tumour, showed that the growth had sprung from the cancellous tissue of the bone. From what has been said above, it will be seen that the spindle-celled sarcomata form a very large and important gvoup of tumours, varying greatly in clinical characters and structiu’e, but all resembling each other in the hroad featine of the spindle-cell forming the predominant element. As to their iJrognosis, it may be broadly stated that the more they approach the structiu’e of the spindle-celled growth found in cicatrising wounds, the less likely they are to give rise to general infection of the system ; but that even the simplest may recur locally after removal, and consequently too guarded a prognosis cannot be given in such cases. Oval-celled Sarcoma may be looked upon as merely an extremely rapidly growing and malignant spindle-celled tumour. Thus we saw in the case j ust mentioned, that, as the rapidity of the growth inercased vdth each recm-rence, the spindle-cells became replaced by large oval cells with two or more nuclei. Sarcomata may occiu’ primarily, presenting similar fcatiu’es. They are soft, rapidly growing, and rarely completely circumscribed. They are of a delicate pinkish colour, and yield an abundant slimy albuminous fluid on section. I have twice had occasion to remove such growths from the neigh- bourhood of the mamma. In one case it recurred locally after the wound had healed, and in a short time formed an enormous tumour, larger than the patient’s head. She refused a second operation, and the case soon terminated fatally. In the other, although a large portion of the pectoral muscle was VOL.

Myeloid or Giant-celled Sarcoma Avas formerly often classed under filjro- plastic tumours, and sometimes probably as soft cancer. It was described by Aberncthy under the name of “ albuminous sai’coma.” It aa\ss first fully described by Lebert, and its clinical and anatomical characters have been carefully in- vestigated by Paget. It is nearly related to the spindle-celled group of sarcomata. The most characteristic fcatime of myeloid tumours is the presence of large, many-nneleated masses of protoplasm—the so-called myeloid cells—somewhat resembling the cells found in the marrow of foetal bones (Pigs. 295, 296). They are often of great size, sometimes ^diameter. They are often extremely irregular in shape, having processes projecting from them in aU directions. The nuclei vary from eight or ten to thirty or forty in number, and are oval in shape, with distinct and highly refracting nucleoh. These myeloid cells are embedded in masses of spindle-shaped or roundish cells, between which there is either no intercellular substance, or merely a small quantity of homogeneous gelatinous material. These growths are extremely vascular, so much so, that the whole mass not nnfrequently pulsates distinctly. Myeloid tumours frequently contain cysts, often of considerable size. On section they present a soft gelatinous appearance and brittle structure ; they usually yield a shmy fluid on scraping, mixed with fragments of the tiunoiu ; they are of a pink colour at their growing margin, while the central parts are of an opaque yellow from fatty degeneration. The intermediate parts usually present patches of a dark maroon colour, caused by extravasations of blood. Occasionally patches of ossification may be foimd. Myeloid tmnonrs grow almost exclusively fr-om bone, and by far most frequently from the medullary cavity or cancellous tissue at the head of along bone. They grow to a large size, sometimes sloAvly and gradually, and at other timeswith very great rapidity. The growth gradually causes absoi-ptiou of the bone, but at the same time a iieAV deposit takes place rig. 295.—jMyeloid Sarcoma from the Lower Jaw (454 diam.)

On examination of such a tumour after re- moval, a bony plate will fre- quently be fovmd separating it from the medullary canal. At other times it may extend a long distance, infiltrating the medulla. Myeloid tumours are most common at the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the tibia, and the upper end of the humerus. They also, when growing from the jaw-bones, form one variety of epuhs. I have removed them from the lower end of the radius, and fr'om the metacarpal bones (Figs. 297,298). In the majority of cases they may be safely removed without the prospect of recur- rence, but occasionally, without any apparent reason, they return after removal. The true myeloid rarely, if ever, gives rise to se- condary deposits in the lymphatic glands or internal organs. Myeloid tumoius are said to have been seen in the parotid region and the mamma, but this is doubtful. Ossifying and Osteoid Sarcomata.---These tumours Avere formerly classed amongst the cancers, under the name of osteoid cancer. Almost any form of sarcoma may undergo ossification. Thus round-ceUed, spiudle-ceUed, and myeloid sarcomata may occasionally show abundant formation of bone. The development of bone in these growths seems to give rise to no radical change in their nature. They still show the same tendency to imlimited growth, and sometimes the same liabihty to recur locally or to give rise to secondary deposits in distant parts. The secondary deposits develope bone like the original growth. The bony parts of these tumoius usually present the appear- ances of tiue bone, but somewhat irregular in structure. Occasionally tumours growing from bone are met with, which present the structiue of the gvowing tissue found beneath the periosteum in inflammation or in normal growth ; that is to say, small round or polygonal cells with simple or multiple nuclei, sepa- rated by a small amount of homogeneous or fibrillated intercellular substance. These groivths readily ossify ; they, form beneath the periosteum, and the bone beneath is often thickened, so tLat the medullary canal may be obliterated. They show a considerable tendency to local recurrence after removal. In rare cases, ossifying sarcomata are found unconnected with pre-existing bone.

They thus closely resemble epithelium-cells in appearance. They are separated from each other by a distinct and somewhat abundant fibrous stroma, but on careful examination this stroma will be found to penetrate between the individual cells. In some parts, probably from the pressure of the grovdng cells, the stroma may be partially absorbed, so that the cellular elements seem to lie in alveolar spaces in immediate contact with each other, but further examination of the tumour will always show parts where the stroma and cells are closely inter- mixed. On carefully pencilhng out the cells from a thin section, it will often be found that a deli- cate stroma is brought into view, passing between the individual cells and subdividing the spaces formed by the bands, which give the growth its alveolar and can- cer-like appearance. In some cases, however, the distinction be- tween these tumom’S and scin’hus is very difficult. Alveolar sar- comata occur chiefly in the cutis, bones, and muscles. In the cutis they form hard rounded tumom’S, often multiple, of tolerably slow growth, and free from pain. They lead ultimately to ulceration of the skin and the formation of an intractable ulcer. In the bones, they are more often single and of more rapid growth. Three cases affecting the cutis have occurred in University College Hospital during the last few years. In the first, three amputations had been performed for recm’rence of the growth after removal, by Christopher Heath, commencing with one finger and ending with the fore-arm. The tumours, when first removed, were supposed to be specimens of sch'rhus of the skin. Finally, similar tumoiu’s appeared in the cheek and scalp, and two more operations were performed. The man died shortly afterAvards, and there was reason to believe that the cause of death was a similar tumoim in the lung. The whole history of the case lasted more than seven years, and at no time had the lymphatic glands been affected. In the second case, Berkeley Hill amputated the leg for a number of similar tumours situated below the knee, from one of which the accompanying draiving is taken; and in the third, Marcus Beck amputated half the foot for a similar growth, which commenced at the roots of the second and thii’d toes, and had reemred three times after removal. Melanotic Sarcoma—Melanosis—formerly included under melanotie cancer, was speciaUy studied by Sir Robert Carswell, Avho arranged it luider the heads of Punctiform Melanosis, in which the dark pigmentary matter ocem-s in the shape of minute points or dots scattered over a considerable extent of sm-face ; Tuberiform Melanosis, occmriug in tumours which vary in bulk from a millet-seed to an egg or an orange, always assuming a globulm, ovoid, or lobulated shape, and being principally met with in the areolo-adipose Fig. 299.—Alveolar 'Sarcoma from Skin of Leg (188 diam.)

Uniy the second or tuberiform me- lanosis is truly a morbid growth, the others beingmercly varieties of pigmentation of pre- existing structures. Melanotic sarcoma is usually of the spindle-ceUed variety, but frequently contains large numbers of round or oval cells intermixed with the fusiform cells (Fig. 300). The spindle- cells are of lai-ge size, and there is no fibrous stroma. The pig- ment is seen as brownish gi-a- nular matter in the interior of a certain number of the cells, the rest remaining colourless. In the secondary tumours, it has been shown by E. J. Godlee that the new cells follow the lines of the vessels. These tumoins are usually shai-ply circumscribed, both to the naked eye and the microscope. They are soft, sometimes almost pulpy, round or oval in shape, and varying in colour from dark brown to the most intense black. They arise especially from structures in which pigment naturally Fig. 300.—Melanotic Sarcoma commencing in the Papillm of tile Skin (Malignant Mole). (40 diam.) a. Supei-ficial Epidermis. 1).

Melanotic sarcoma is one ot the most malignant of all forms of timiour. The secondary deposits occur m cTeiy organ and tissue in the body, and they may apparently lie propagated entirely by the Yaseular system, the lymphatic glands escaping any contamina- tion, or they may be distributed by both the vascular and the lymphatic systems. It may be broadly stated that if a melanotic sarcoma reach the size of a filbert secondary deposits have in aU probability ocemred, and no local treatment can cure the patient, although, by relieving him of one source of infection, it may retard death. Although showing this temble general malignancy, the local malignancy of melanotic sarcoma is not great. It may reach a large size ivithout ulcerating ; it is frequently distinctly encapsuled, and, if removed freely, often docs not return in the scar. The secondary tumom’s form in every part of the body ; constantly in the limgs and liver, almost constantly in the brain and spinal cord, spleen and kidneys, and subcutaneous tissue ; very often in the heart, intestines, medulla of bones, and lymphatic glands. Like the cells of the primary tumour, some of the secondary growths are found to be jugmented and some not. The diagnosis of melanotic sarcoma is made by the colour and rapidity of the growth. It must not be confounded vdth the simple j)igmented wart. This is always of slow growth, more or less firm, peduncu- lated and lobulated. It must be remembered, however, that melanotic sarcoma may start fr’om a Avart of this kind, or from a congenital mole. As to true melanotic cancer, that is to say, pigmented encephaloid, it is doubtful if such a growth exists, and if it do, it must be of extreme rarity. The Treatment of melanosis is the removal of the tumom’ as soon as it is diagnosed, unless secon- dary deposits can ah’eady be recognised. Psammoma is a rare form of tumom.’ found only in coimection vith the membranes of the brain. The chief characteristic of these growths is the presence of small concentric calcareous globules, the so-caUed “ brain-sand.” They are chiefly composed of pecuhar flattened cells. They give rise to no symptoms, except in infinitely rare cases. Sarcomatous Blood-cysts, or Hsematomata.-—Tumours have been fr-e- quently described under the name of “blood-cysts,” of which the most characteristic feature was the presence of a large collection of fluid or partly coagulated blood in a cyst, the walls of which were imperfectly defined. If the blood were evacuated by pimcture or incision, free hjemorrhage, difficult to control, or, at least, speedy re-accumulation of the fluid, was the only result. If seated on a limb, free excision of the cyst and its contents, or amputation, Avas justly looked upon as the only mode of treatment holding out any prospect of success. The nature of these tumoius was not AveU understood ; it has, however, recently been shown that in all probability they are, in the great majority of cases, soft sarcomata, broken doAAm by haemorrhage into their structure. The walls of these cysts are formed of a thin layer of sarcoma tissue, either of the round or spindle-ceUed variety. A vei’y interesting case of this kind came under my care in University College Hospital in 1874. A healthy man, aged 40, had noticed, for about nine months, a soft sAA'eUing on the upper and outer part of the leg, AAffiich he attributed to a strain. It fluctuated distinctly ; and AAffien I first saAV it, a dark red fluid was oozing from tAvo dis- coloured points. It Avas altogether about three inches in diameter and of a775 CANCER OR CARCINOMA.

" “Mixed Sarcomata.—Tumoiu’S are frequently seen Avhich combine in them- selves striictm-es properly belonging to two or more distinct forms o grow Several of these have been already mentioned. Thus the growths standing on the doubtful line between small spindle-celled sarcoma and fibroma, are spo en of aBfiiro-sarcomata. In very rare cases some of the cells of a sarcoma may olevelope into true fat-cells ; Ave have then the Upo-sarcoma. Spindle-celled or small round-celled tissue is not iiiifrequently associated with cartilaginous tumours, forming the chondrosarcoma. Occasionally large tracts of a tumour, the chief part of which is purely sarcomatous, may midergo mucous softening, and the ceUs may be more or less stellate or branched, as in a myxoma, and we have then the myxosarcoma. As before stated, the tissue between the acini ■of an adenoma may present exactly the striictm’e of a spindle-celled or even roimd-ceUed sarcoma ; these tumoms are then sometimes called a^7eno-sa)•co- meda. Lastly, the stroma of a cancer may be composed of cells like those ^ a large spindle-celled sarcoma.

TUMOURS COMPOSED OF CELLS OF AN EPITHELIAL T'VPE ARRANGED IN SPACES IN A STROMA CONSISTING OF MORE OR LESS PERFECTLY DEVELOPED FIBROUS TISSUE. The members of this group constitute the cancers or carcinomata, and are uniformly malignant in their progress. Cancer, Carcinoma.—Before proceeding to the indiA'idiial growths forming" this class, it Avill be desirable to say a feAV Avords upon the subject of cancer generally.* The term has been very A'agiiely applied, the older pathologists * It is not my intention to enter largely into the general history of malignant diseases, as siuice ''vill not admit of mv doing so ; I would therefore refer my readers, who wish for further information on this inte- resting subject, to the works of Aheruethy; tiie iiapers hy Lawrence; tlie admirable and magnificent “ illustrations of the Elementary Forms of Disease,” hy Sir R. Carswell: to the excellent and copious monograph hy AValslie; and to P-iget's piiilosophic Lectures on this subject.

Accidents of structure or appearance have been designated by special names, as Cystic, Villous, Fungoid, &c, and thas much contusion has resulted. Cancers may be conveniently divided into four groups, which must not, how- ever, be taken as possessing any positively distinctive characters, but merely as types of certain important varieties, viz.; Encephaloid, soft or acute Cancer; bciiThus, hard or chronic Cancer; Epithelial or Integumental Cancer, and the Adenoid or Glandular Cancer, or Tubular Epithelioma. This di’dsion will be found to facilitate the study of the numerous minor varieties which occasionally present themselves. Viewing the four varieties of cancer above enumerated as formed upon a common type, we cannot be surprised at finding veiy niuneroiis points of resemblance existing amongst them ; thus one form of cancer may take the place of another, or be associated with it; encephaloid occun’ing after the removal of scin-hus, or being associated with a structine allied to epithelioma. This identity of seat and of reciuTence, which tends more than anything else to establish a common origin amongst these tumours, has been specially pointed out by Carswell. Then, again, these tiimoiu’s are all of a truly malignant character, having a tendency to induce a peculiar and similar condition of the system that goes by the name of the Cancerous Cachexy. In chemical composition, also, they are nearly identical, being principally composed of albumen. We will now describe and compare the Scirrhous and Encephaloid cancers : the epithelial and adenoid forms, iiresenting some very marked peculiarities of structure, will be more conveniently considered apart from the others. Microscopic Structure.—The microscopic characters of the different forms of cancer have of late years attracted considerable attention amongst pathologists. They consist, in aU the varieties, essentially of the same elements, though these may differ somewhat in aj)pearance, and in relative preponderance, in the different forms of the affection. A cancer always presents collections of cells of an epithelial ty]ie, gi’ouped together irregularly, in close contact vdth each other, and enclosed in spaces always more or less distinctly alveolar. As in a normal gland we can have no doubt where the epithelium ends and the fibrous tissue begins, so in a cancer there is a sharply defined fine between the cells and the stroma. The cells ai’e but loosely connected with the stroma and with one another, and in many cases are separated from each other by a very small quantity of fluid. If a thin section of a cancer be gently brushed under water with a camel’s hair pencil, or shaken in a test-tube half full of water, the cells may be washed away and the stroma left. Its alveolar natui’e iriU then be distinctly apparent, and the fibrous stroma will bo seen to bound spaces which by their communication form a cavernous system. Every cancerous tumour is siuToiinded by a halo of small777 MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF CANCER. cell-infiltration, implicating the suiTonncling parts, and in this mass of snic round cells it is somewhat difficult to discern the exact process by ^^duch the tumour OTOWS. It is this that has led to the gi’eat diversity of opinion as to the histological origin of cancer. In the central parts of cancers, as of sarco- mata, degenerative changes are almost invariably found. These Unnom-s yield on scraping or pressure a miUcy fluid, termed the Gancer-jimc, in which cells and granules are found in varying proportions. The gi-anules are mostly fatty, and m-e the result of fatty degeneration of the cells of the tumoim. This milky juice, it must be observed, is not absolutely characteristic of cancer. It is yielded by the lymphadenomata and by all the sarcomata, provided at least twenty-foiu- hoiu-s elapse after their removal before they are examined. At one time tlie cells of cancer were looked upon as characteristic of the disease (Fig. 304), and the cancer-cell was spoken of as something absolutely peciihar and diagnostic; it is now known, however, that the exact deter- mination of the nature of a gi-owth can only be made by careful examination, not of the cells only, but also of the stroma and of the relation of the cells to the stroma. The mode in which the tumoiu’ invades sur- rounding parts is also an impor- tant aid in determining the nature of the growth. The Cells of a cancer are extremely variable in shape and size. They may be romid, caudate, and even fusiform. Many varieties of form are usually found in the same tiimoiu', but occasionally great unifonnity prevails. The size may vary from ^-gVo inch. The nuclei are oval and highly refracting, often placed excentrically ; they are of considerable size and frequently double, while in some cases five or six may be found in the same cell. They contain bright shining nucleoli. The size of the cells is not indicative of the variety of the cancer. Thus, in some scirrhous tumours the cells may be small, and in others large, and the same may be said of encephaloid. The distinction between scirrhus and eneephaloid is made not by the size of the cells, but by the relative proportions of cells and stroma in the mass. AH cancer-cells are prone to early degenera- tion, usually becoming filled with fat-granules, and ultimately breaking dovm and in great part disappearing, so that what was once a considerable mass of cells may be represented by a few granules. This is most marked in sciii’hus. In other cases the cells undergo colloid degeneration. A globule of colloid matter first appears in the cell, pushing the nucleus to one side. Finally the nucleus disappears, and the whole cell becomes filled with the colloid matter, and at last bursts. It is this change occurring in an encephaloid cancer that is supposed to give rise to the so-called colloid cancer. Creighton has lately Fig. 304. A. Cells from a large Encephaloid of the Breast. B.

(454 diam.)778 TUMOURS. described a process of Vcaciw^ or endogenous cell-formation, to wliicli he attributes the multiplication of the cells not only of cancer, but of sarcoma and m his opinion the original cells of the cancer are formed from the pre- cxistnig epithehum-cells of the part by this process. The stroma of cancer is in the vast majority of cases formed of fibrous tissue, throughout which we have cells, of the ordinary connective tissue type, scattered more or less abun- dantly, In rapidly growing cancers there may be numerous spindle-cells scat- tered amongst the fibres, or in some rare cases the whole stroma may be composed of spindle-cells, its structure then resembling that of a sarcoma. The alveolar arranpment is well marked in every scirrhous and cncephaloid cancer ; in epithelioma it is not feo clear, but still the same type is maintained, that is to say, the cells are arranged in groups in immediate contact vdth each other, and the groups separated by fibrous or fibroid tissue, bearing vessels. The stroma of a cancer is often loaded with fat-granules in the degenerating parts of the tumoiu’, but it very rarely undergoes calcification. It has been much disputed in former times whether the stroma of the cancer belongs to the tumour or merely represents the remnants of pre-existing tissues invaded by the tnmoiu’. There can be no doubt that the stroma is developed by an nimatiu'al growth of the pre-existing connective tissues, just as much as the ' cells arc supposed to be developed by an abnormal process of gi’owth taking place in the pre-existing ■ epithelium, but in no cancer is any structure which could be said to be a mere remnant of the pre-existing tissues, ever found in the fully developed parts of the tumoiu’. The stroma deviates as much as the cells fr'om the normal structure of the affected part. The Uood-vessels ol cancer are very abundant, especially in cncephaloid, in which the stroma may chiefly consist of vessels, the fibrous tissue being comparatively small in nmount. These vessels frequently are so abundant as to give the whole tumom* u, distinct sense of pulsation. In some cases they show curious bud-hke pro- cesses and dilatations projecting from their walls. That cancerous tumoiu’s are in intimate coimection with the hjmiohatics of the j^arts in which they gTow, no one can doubt, but the exact nature of this connection is not yet accurately made out. It has been asserted by Kdster, of Wiii-zburg, that the cancer cells actually lie in Ijnnphatic spaces. Cornil and Eamder state that there arc abundant lymph-spaces opening directly into the alveolar spaces in which the cancer-ceUs are lying. Either view, if proved, would fully account for the extraordinary readiness with which cancer infects the system through the lymphatics. Much diversity of opinion formerly existed amongst Singeons as to the value that should be attached to these microscopic signs in determining the true natme of many tumoiu’s ; some being guided by these appearances alone, ethers looking upon them as luicertain and fallacious, and trusting rather to the general characters of the growth. The latter, however, appears to me to be too limited a view of the siteject; for, although the unaided eye of an ■experienced Sm’geon may in many cases recognise the true chai’acter of a tumoin, and the microscope in some few instances fail to afford much ad- ditional information, yet there can be no doubt that in most cases it is only by the aid of this instrument that the real nature of the growth can be absolutely determined.779 Olliom AND GllOWTIL OF CANCER. It is doubtless true that every one of the microscopic elements above 1 .■] nnv senorately occur in the normal tissues and secretions of the bodT some in the adult, others, as the caudate and fusiform in the embryo : but, though this be the case, it does not appear that they are ever found similai-ly grouped in any tumours, except those of a cancerous nature ; and in these it is rather by the aggTegation of these appearances, than by any single one in particular, that the true charactei of the disease is determined. In his examinations, however, the experienced Sim^eon mil find that the appearances presented to the naked eye will ass him“much in pronoimcing upon the mahgnant or cancerous character of the and Growth of Cancer.—The exact mode of origin and growth of a cancer is still a much disputed point, and opinions are still much dudded upon it. Virchow attributed the origin and growth entirely to changes occurring in the connecth-e-tissue-corpusclcs. He believed that the first change was a midtiplication of these cells, certain gi-oups of which afterwards developed into ceUs of an epithehal type, while from the remainder the stroma was formed. This Hew may now be said to be finally abandoned, since the discovery of the exudation of the white corpuscles of the blood. ^ There may then be said to be three chief views at present held by pathologists of high repute. 1st. That of Thiersch and Waldeyer, that the cells of cancer are the direct descendants of pre-existing epithelium-ceUs, and that true carcinoma can never arise except in connection with epithelium. The term epithelium is here used in its limited sense, meaning only those cells which cover free smfaces, as distinguished from the “ endothelium, which lines blood-'s essels and lymph-spaces or cavities. On this view, true carcinoma can never arise primarily in bone, muscle, or subcutaneous tissue. Waldeyer believes that the rapidly gTowirrg epithehum-cells force their way into the lymphatic spaces, and that the alveoli of the cancer-stroma are indeed only altered lymph- spaces. He beheves he has demonstrated a layer of endothelium, covering the epithelium-cells of the cancer. If this be correct, the great readirress with which cancer infects the lymphatic glands is fully explained. The observations of Thiersch were confined to epithelioma ; Waldeyer exterrded his Hews to all forms of carreer. 2nd. That of Koster, who also believes that the ceUs of a carreer are actuaUy enclosed in lymph-spaces, but attributes their origirr to proliferation of the endothelium of the lymphatics. Orr this view, true carreer may arise primarily in any structrne of the body. 3rd. That of Classerr, who attributes the gvowth of cancer to charrges takirrg place in white blood-corpuscles, which have migrated from the blood-vessels. This view is identical with Virchow’s, except that Avhite blood-corpirscles are substituted for proliferated connective-tissue corpuscles—a change Avhich has been almost urriversal in pathology sirree Cohrrheim demorrstrated the import- ance of the fact of the migTatiorr of these corpuscles. Orr this A’ierv also, true cancer may originate in airy structure in the body. The first of these three viervs is steadily gainiirg ground. It has the support of Billroth and marry other emiirent pathologists. This view necessitates the780 TUMOURS. carefnl separation of malignant sarcomata, such as are common in bones, g ands, and subcutaneous tissue, from true cancers, such as arise in connection mth glands, skin, and mucous membranes. Quite recently, Creighton has carried out a series of investigations for the Medical Department of the Privy Council, which tend to confirm the view that epithelium is the starting point of cancer ; but he believes that under certain circumstances epithelium may also give rise to cells of the connective tissue type. The observations leading to this conclusion were made on a case of secondary spindle-celled sarcoma in the liver. He describes a process of vacuolation and endogenous cell-formation. A clear space first appears in the cell, pushing the nucleus to one side. In this space in the epithelium-cell, the spindle-cell is formed. The question is necessarily one of great difficulty, and presents a large field for further inquiry. Progress.—The general characters that attend the progress of the scin’hous and encephaloid forms of cancer present numerous points of resemblance. When once formed, the tumour continues progressively to increase hi size, with a degree of rapidity, and to an extent, that vary according to its kind ; the scin’hous tumour gTowing most slowly, and attaining but moderate dimensions; the encephaloid often with gveat rapidity, and to an immense size. When the full growth of the tumour has been attained, the process of decay commences. The mass softens at some point, the skin covering which becomes duskily inflamed and ulcerated, and an irregular sloughy aperture forms, through which the dehHs of the mass are eliminated in an ichorous or sanious fluid, having often a peculiar fetid smell. The ulcer then rather rapidly increases, with everted edges, a hard and knobby, or soft and frmgatiug surface, and the discharge of a dark fluid, often attended by hiemoiThage, and occasionally with sloughing of portions of the mass. Coincidently ivith the implication and ulceration of the skin, there is usually deposit in the lym- phatic glands with great increase of pain, and most commonly with the super- vention of the constitutional cachexy; though in some cases this condition precedes the cutaneous impheation. This cachexy may possibly be due to some modifleation in the condition of the blood, induced by the action of the morbid growth on the economy. The exhaustion resulting from the ulceration, sloughing, and consecutive hmmoirhage, and the secondary deposits in internal organs, also commonly increases this cachectic state ; in many instances it is not marked until after the skin has become affected, and in others it does not supervene until ulceration is actually set up. In this cachexy the countenance is pecnliarly pale, dravm, and sallow, so that the patient has a very anxious and care-worn look. The general surface of the body commoifly acquires an eai'thy or yellowish tint, and not unfrequently large spots of pityriasis or chloasma make their appearance on various parts of it; the appetite is impaired, the voice enfeebled, the muscular strength gveatly diminished, and the piflse weak. The patient complains of pains in the limbs, of lassitude, and of inability lor exertion ; he emaciates rapidly, and frequently suffers by the occurrence ol cancerous deposits in internal organs ; and at last dies from exhaustion, induced by the conjoined effects of Aveakening discharges, general debility> and pain.781 ULCERATION' OF SCIRRUUS. These general characters of cancerous gi-orvths present certain imporbmt • g- e nof.nrdiiio- to the form of the disease that is developed. ' ''sfiThus.-The^cirrh or hard cancer, is most commonly met ^^•lth as a 1 Tar.aU ill tlip fomale breast, in various portions of the ahmentaiy piimaiy ep , pylorus, the sigmoid flexm-e of the colon, and the if^h^Z secondari^m the iT.pMc o-hnds It occurs in two forms ; either as a circumscribed mass, 01 inliltiated t the tissue of an organ. In either case it forms a nrcssiUe, and nodulated tumom-, at firet niorable and unconnected avith the Lin, but soon acquiring deep-seated attachments, and implicating t e in egu- inent. It gi-ows slowly, seldom attaining a larger size than an orange. At times painfoss, at others it is painful, aching generally, occasionally with much radiating and shooting pain through it. These sensations vary accoi ding to the part affected, and to the sensibility of the indi\-idual ; the pains are especially severe after the tumour has been handled, and at night are of a lancinating, neuralgic character. The tumour may thus continue in a chi-onic state for a considerable length of time, slowly increasing, gradually extending its deeper prolongations, and implicating the more superficial parts. In some cases, more particularly in elderly people, scirrhus gives rise to atrophy of the oi-o-an in which it is seated, causing wi’inkling and puckering of the sur- rounding skin, which becomes adherent to the tumom’; and the cancer may thus continue in a very chronic state. The ulceration usually takes place by the skin becoming adherent at one point to the tumour, either by dimpling in, being as it were di’awn down towards it, or else by being pushed forwards, stretched, and implicated in one of its more prominent masses ; it then becomes dusky and hvid red, somewhat glazed, and covered by a fine vascular net-work. Softening occiirt. at one point, where a crack or fissure forms ; a clear drop of gummy fluid exudes from this, and dries in a small scab upon the sm’face : this is followed by a somewhat bloody discharge of a thick and glutinous character ; and the small patch of skin from which it issues, becoming undermined, speedily sloughs away, leading a circular ulcer. This gradually enlarges, becoming ragged and sloughy, with craggy everted edges, ha^dng irregular masses arising from its surface, and discharging a fetid sanious pus. The pain increases greatly ; and, the lymphatic glands becoming involved, cachexy is fully developed, and the patient is destroyed by it or by the secondary visceral deposits. In old people, ulceration of scirrhous masses often assumes an extremely chronic ■character, the growth in them not being endued Avith the same A'itality as in the young. The ulcer in these cases is flat, sloughy, of a greyish-green colour, hard and rugged, with puckered edges, and much -wrinkling of the surrounding skin, and exhaling the usual fetid odour. In younger persons, and especially in stout Avomen Avith florid complexions, the disease usually makes rapid progress. So also, if inflammation bo accidentally set up in the neighbouring tissues, cancerous infiltration rapidly takes place in them. I once had under my care an old man Avith a cancerous tumour of the leg, which, after remaining stationary for seven years, became accidentally inflamed, and afterwards increased Avith gi’eat rapidity. Occasionally, but A'ery rarely, scirrhous masses slough out, leaving a large ragged cavity, Avhich may even cicatrise ; and782 TUMOURS. n cancerous infiltration 1 • ri f! ^ considerable distance around the tumour into integument Aidiich to the naked eye appears quite healthy, but Avith the microscope Avill afford unequivocal evidence of the existence of cancer-germs diffused tLugh It It extends like a halo around the original tumour, and very probably shades off into the surrounding textures. It is of great importance in determinino- the question of operation to bear this in mind, and not to act on the supposition of the tumoim being abruptly defined. The secondaiy deposits from scin-hous tumours may take place in the viscera more particularly the Imigs or liver, or in the lymphatic glands ; in the fonner situation they are often encephaloid, in the latter they assume the scin-hous form. Structure.—After a scin-hous tumom- has been removed, though still feelino- firm under the fingers, it is not so hard as A^hen it Avas in the body ; oAving, as Walshe observes, to the escape of its fluids and consequent loss of tiir- gescence. On cutting it Avith the scalpel, it usually creaks somcAvhat as it is cliAdded, and presents a A\-hitish or bluish-Avhite glistening sm-face, intersected by Avhite bands, -which apparently consist partly of ucav structure, partly of included areolar tissue. This section has not inaptly been compared to the appearance presented by a cut through a turnip or an unripe pear, hence tei-med napiform and apinoidhj Walshe ; and, from its reticulated character, carcinoma reticulare by Midler. A curious feature about scin-hous cancer, in Avhich it differs from almost all other tumours, is that it becomes cup-shaped on section. This seems to be due to the fact that in most scin-hous tumom-s a kind of process of cicatrisation takes place in the central parts, -while the peripheral parts are stdl growing. The cells undergo fatty degeneration and break up. The greater part of the 23roducts of degeneration are absorbed, and only a narrow streak of granides Fig. 305.—SciiTlms of Breast (1S8 cliam.)

A little nearer the centre the alveolar an-angement becomes apparent, and gTOups of rounded or irregidar cells, with large oval nuclei, are found imbedded in spaces in a stroma of coarse fibrous tissue. These spaces communi- cate with each other like those of a sponge. The stroma and cells there usually form about equal bulks of the growth. The stroma shows signs of active growth, having spindle - cells scattered here and there through it, sometimes in abundance. A little nearer the centre we find the cells begin- ning to degenerate, the nuclei be- coming hidden by clouds of fat-granules, and perhaps fat-granules appearing in the stroma ; the spindle-ceUs are replaced by elongated tailed cells with scarcely any protoplasm around the nuclei. Towards the centre the fatty cells disappear, and a few granules only mark where they were, and the stroma becomes dense and hard, and even the nuclei before mentioned are difficult to recognise. The above is a description of the ordinary sciirhus of moderately slow growth. In more vigorously growing specimens the degeneration is delayed, the cica- trisation is less perfect, and the proportion of bulk occupied by the cells is increased. Encephaloid.—A large number of growths formerly classed as encephaloid cancer are now included under the various forms of rapidly growing soft sarco- mata. The true encephaloid cancer is a comparatively uncommon disease. It occius in the testis and the breast, and may often attain an enormous size, equal to that of an adult head. In bone it is extremely rare, if it ever arise in this situation primarily. The tumours formerly described as cancer of bone are now included under the names of round-celled, spindle-celled, and giant- celled, or myeloid sarcoma. The encephaloid cancer of the cyc-baU is now classed with sarcomata, under the name of glioma or glio-sarcoma ; and the disease described as cancer of the bones of the face is now also known to be almost invariably if not always sarcomatous. Encephaloid cancer commences as a tumour, which, though occasionally somewhat hard, is usually from the first, or at all events soon becomes, softTUMOURS. 784 and elastic, Lcing more or less lobulated, growing rapidly, and having an •elastic and at last a senn-fluetuating feel. The skin covering it is nsna% at first pale and loose, with a large net-work of dilated veins spreading over it In sonae cases, however, at a very early period, a species of inflammatory integuments covering rapidly gi-owing encephaloid tnmoms. As the tumom- enlarges, the skin becomes adherent, diseoloured of ^ purple-brown tint, and at last ulcerates at one point. When once the tumour has made its way through, and is relieved from the pressure of the fascia and integuments, the rapidity of its growth becomes fearfully increased; and a large soft fungous mass, rugged, irregular, dark-coloured, and bleeding profusely rapidly sprouts forth, constituting the affection to which Hey gave the appro- priate term of fumjus Immatocles: ^Yhen this condition has been reached, ■death rapidly ensues fr-om exhaustion and hiemorrhage. Pulsation has been met with in particular forms of very vascular encephaloid ; in these cases also a loud bruit, synchronous with the pulsation and the heart’s action, has been detected, and may be heard on the application of a stethoscope. These symp- toms have been most frequently met with in encephaloid tumoiu’s connected with bone, and may, unless care be taken, cause the disease to be confoimded with aneurism. The constitutional cachexy in encephaloid occm-s early, and is well marked ; and secondary affections of the lymphatic glands and viscera, occasionally of a scirrhous character, often take jilace. No absolute and sharp line can be drawn between sciirhus and encephaloid ; gradually merge into one another. Thus the secondary tumours in the li'\ er are usually somewhat firm, and often go by the name of scirrho-encepha- loid. Again, a tumour which one Surgeon might call encephaloid of the breast, another might speak of as a rapidly growing scirrhus. Structure.—After removal, the tumour is found to be very vascular, dis- Fig. 307.—Encephaloid of Breast (IS8 diam.) Tlie largo-colled variety.

Two only of these, the Colloid and the Mdanotic, require notice in this place. Colloid, Gelatinous, or Alveolar Cancer may occur in distinct masses, often of a very large size, weighing many pounds, or may be infiltrated into the tissue of organs. As it is most commonly met with in the viscera of the abdo- men, it does not so often fall under the observation of the Siu’geon as the other varieties of cancer. Yet it may form superficially. I have met with it in the breast, forming a very large tumour ; and there is a preparation in the Univci- sity College Museum of a scirrhous breast containing colloid.

The septa forming these spaces arc distinctly fibrous and regular in their aiTaiigcment (Fig. 308). Some of the spaces are completely filled with colloid matter, others may show a few cells containing VOL. I. 3 ETUMOUIiS. 786 fat grannies in the centre, snrronnclod by zones of gi-annles, resulting from the degeneration of other cells. Cells again may be seen in the process of under- going colloid degeneration. A globule of colloid matter first appears pushino- the nucleus to one side ; afterwards the nucleus undergoes a similar degenera^ tion ; and finally the cell bursts and disappears, leaving behind it only a few gi’annlcs (Fig. 308). True colloid cancer is merely a degeneration of scin-hus or cncephaloid. Many other tumours have been described in former times as colloid, amongst which may be mentioned many myxomata, oedematons soft fibioniata, and some glandular tiimoiu’s which had undergone colloid degene- ration. Melanotic Cancer.—It is quite possible that there may be a pigmented foim of true cancer, but if so it is extremely rare. Such a form of tumour is mentioned by Cornil and Ranvicr, but they do not record a case. The tumours formerly described under the name of melanotic cancer have already been mentioned with the sarcomata (see page 772). So-called Osteoid Cancer is probably always ossifying sarcoma. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of the different forms of cancer is not always easily made. Scirrhus, when in tumour, may very readily be confounded with fibrous tumours and chronic glandular masses, or with the indurated atrophy of a part; in many of these cases, indeed, the diagmosis cannot be coiTectly effected until after removal. In other cases, however, the rugged feel, the lancinating pains, and the tendency to the implication of the lymphatics, or to affection of the general health, will commonly serve to establish the diagnosis. IVIien ulceration has taken place, the previous condition of the tumour, the general character of the sore, and the microscopic examination of the debris, may serve to denote its true character. Encephciioid in tiimoiu- may be confounded ivith abscess, with cysts, or with fatty, erectile, and sanguineous tumours, and with the various soft varieties of sarcoma ; and, when pulsating, wdth anemism. In these cases cai-efril palpation, the existence of elasticity without fluctuation, and the presence of the large and tortuous veins ramifying over the surface of the mass, may establish its true character. When it is fungating, it may be confounded with the sprouting intracystic growths that sometimes spring fr-om the interior of a cystic tumour. Here, however, a microscopic examination of the debris, as well as the existence or absence of contamination of neighboiu’ing lymphatics, wiU show the true nature of the affection. The diagnosis of a tumour as a cancer is sometimes materially obscured by the accidental development of abscess in the tissues around or above it. In such cases, the continuance of a swelling which is evidently not iiiflammatoiy, after the pus has been evacuated, may lead to a suspicion as to the true nature of the disease. Causes.—The causes of cancer, as of aU other diseases, may be divided into two gi’eat classes, 'S’iz.: the constitutional or predisposing, and the local or exciting. So far as the constitutional or predisposing causes of this disease are con- cerned, it maybe said that it is difficult to coiuiect any distinct or recognisable constitutional condition with a tendency to this disease. Cancer no doubt commonly shows itself in persons aiiparently in perfect health, of florid787 CAUSES OF CANCER. complexion, robust habit of body, with every aspect of health and sign of ^^^Thitlf we fail to recognise by outward signs a constitutional tendency to cancer, we cannot doubt that its development is connected with a hereditary tendency, and is influenced by age. The Jieredilariupss of cancer haS been established beyond a doubt. V elpcau states, as the result of his researches, that it is traceable hereditarily in one- third of the cases. Paget finds that amongst hospital patients the hereditari- ness amounts to about 1 in G, but amongst private patients, whose family histories are better known, it is found to bo hereditary in 1 in 3 ; thus agree- ! ing with Velpeau’s estimate. I In this respect cancer stands very much in the same category as many other j tumours, and, as will be shown more fully when we come to discuss the com- plicated and very difficult question of the origin of cancer, hereditariness must not be taken as synonymous with the constitutionalism of cancer or any other disease. A strictly local tendency, whether to shape of feature, deformity of body, or I purely local tumour, as wart, ganglion, or hpoma, may be transmitted as readily as a constitutional predisposition to any given disease. Hence, in saying that cancer is hereditary in one-third of the cases, it is not necessarily implied that it is constitutional in them, but simply that there is a tendency in a certain number of individuals to transmit the disposition to the disease to their offspring, just as they may transmit a pecuharity of feature, a tendency to premature baldness, or to a fatty tumour. Admitting the hereditary nature of cancer to the fullest extent, however, it still leaves two- thirds of the cases imaccounted for. Affe exercises a marked influence on the occim’ence of cancer ; and its influence is marked in two ways :—1. In the absolute frequency of the occur- rence of cancer; and 2, in the relative frequency with which it develops in different organs at different periods of life, and in the different forms that it assumes. Although cancer is undoubtedly rare in early life, yet it may possibly be a congenital affection. It may occur at all periods of hfe from the earliest ages ; and will evince itself in persons from eighty to ninety years of age. According' to Walshe, the mortality from cancer goes on steadily increasing till the eightieth year ; hence the popular belief, that the middle period of life is most obnoxious to it, would appear to bo an erroneous one. Age, however, influences the liability to cancer in special organs. Thus malignant tumour of the eye and of the bones frequently occurs in children; of the testis, not uncommonly, in young adults; whilst, in the female, Sibley states that the average age of patients with uterine cancer is forty-throe, and Avith mammary, forty- eight years. All forms of cancer arc not, hoAvever, met with in equal frequency at all ages ; the encephaloid being the most common in the young, and scirrhus in the middle-aged and elderly.

TUMOURS. Menial Emotions ol a depressing cliaraeter, if long-continued or fTecpicntly repeated, may possibly predispose to the occurrence of cancer. I have seen so many cases of cancer, more particularly of the abdominal organs, in in- di^■iduals who ha^'o sulfered much from grief, anxiety, or harass of mind for years before the development of the malignant disease, that, although the doctrine is incapable of proof, I cannot but look upon it as probable, that the edneer was the result of the antecedent long-continued mental dis- quietude. We know, by cvery-day experience, that functional derangement of the abdominal and pelvic organs of the most inveterate character may be occasioned by mental disturbance ; and it appears to me not improbable, that such functional derangement may at last lead to perversion of nutri- tion, terminating in malignant deposits in such organs, as the uterus, the liver, or the stomach, as are more readily influenced by the condition of the patient’s mind. , Sex.—The influence of sex is well marked, not only in the absolute hequency of cancer, but in its occmrence in organs that are special to each sex. Cancer is absolutely far more frequently met with in women than in men, simply because cancers of the uterus and mamma constitute by far the largest proportion of these diseases, being infinitely more common than cancers of the male organs. But when we come to cancers of organs that are common to both sexes, as the eye, the tongue, the lip, the intestinal tract, &c., we shall, I think, find that they are more common in these situations in men than in women ; the difference, however, not being sufficient to counterbalance the preponderance in the female reproductive organs. The Exciting causes of ca^icer are of two kinds ; dhect external violence, or long-continued irritation of a part. A blow on, or other injmy of a part, often appears to be the direct deter- mining cause of the development of a primary cancer. Scirrhus of the mamma is commonly attributed by the suficrer to the infliction of an injmy. So in other situations. Thus Paget relates cases in which cancer has developed after the fractine of a bone at the seat of injury, and in the orbit after a blow on the eye. Long-continued irritation of a part may also develop cancer. This is a matter of every day obser\'ation in the development of cancer of the tongue from the persistent irritation of a broken or jagged tooth, or the production of cancer of the lip by the constant use of an unprotected clay-pipe. But, perhaps, the best marked instance of the production of this form of cancer, is that of the cancer of the scrotmn in chimney-sweeps, developed by the irritation of the soot lodged in the rugae—a form of disease which, as Be Morgan has pointed out, is fast disappearing with the cessation of the employment of climbing-boys, a strong argument in favour of the theory of the local origin of cancm-, that a form of the disease should cease to appear on the removal of the soince of local irritation that produced it. But local in-itation is more likely to produce cancer if it be applied to a part that has already been for some time the seat ol structural epithelial chanp. Thus a connnon wart, mole, or cicatrix is very apt to assume a cancerous action under the influence of persistent irritation. And, as J. Hutchinson has tru } observed, a cancer may in this way be “ grown.789 GEOGR APIIICAL DISTRIBUTION OF CANCER.

The answer to involves the whole theory of the local or constitutional origin of cancel, to which I must refer the reader. (See next page.) . It is A-ery important to bear in mind that all tissues' and organs are not equally liable to cancer. Amongst the tissues, the skin and mucous meinteane and the parenchyma of organs are the favom^ed seats of the disease. It is a doubt Avhether it over occurs primarily in serous or synovial inembrau , muscle, or cartilage. . Every organ of the body is liable to the development of cancer. Eiit it ocem-s mosl frequently in the organs of reproduction—111 the mamma anc uterus of the female—in the penis and testis of the male. The tongue and certain portions of the intestinal tract—viz., the cardiac and pyloric orifices, the sigmoid flexure, and the lower part of the rectum and the anus—are favourite seats for the development of cancer. It has been obserA ed that in those organs which liai'C an intermittent functional activity, cancer is moie frequent than in others, and in them it is especially apt to occiu- at tbe periods of commencing senile degeneracy or functional disease. The Geographical Distribution of Cancer is a most interesting and important element in the problem of its origin, and by a closer study of it than has hitherto been made, I believe that much light may be thrmvn 011 this. Cancer appears to be a disease favoured by, if not actually dependent on, the aggregation of indhddiials under the influence of an advanced civilisation. Amongst savage tribes, as amongst wild animals, it is unknomi. In the great centres of ciAilisation, as amongst domesticated animals, it abounds. This circumstanee points certainly to the possibility of there being a parasitic origin for the disease—to the possibility, in fact, of its being originally an organism that has entered the body from without. Of this, hoivever, ive possess as yet no evidence. Cancer is said to be iinknoAvn in the frigid zone. The Esquimaux in the Western, and the Samoieds and other migratory tribes in the Eastern hemi- sphere, are equally exempt from it. Amongst the inhabitants of the torrid zone it also rarely occurs ; though in the more populous parts and the seats of an older civilisation, as in India, it is not unknown. But on this and other points connected Avith the gcogTaphical distribution of this fell scourge, we require additional and precise information. Cancer is certainly more common in Europe than in any other part of the ch-ilised world. In some parts of the United States of America and in China it also appears to be of frequent occuiTence, Avhilst in South America, in Africa (except Egypt), and in tbe greater part of Asia, it is not common. ilaviland has obtained very important results fronr the investigations of the tables of mortality of this country, Avith regard to the distribution of cancer in Great Britain ; and his investigations appear to lead to this conclusion, that geological formation, soil, and resulting endemic conditions exercise a marked influence on the development of cancer.790 TUMOURS. Haviland finds, Avitli regard to England, that cancer is most common in the cstern and north-M'Cstcru parts ot the kingdom, including Wales; and that geneially thioughout the more eleA'ated midland and southern districts it is not counnon. It is less frecpient on the older geological formations, towards the sources of rivers, and in dry well-drained districts. He points out, on the other hand, that the sites of the groat cancer-fields of England are the tertiary formations and the alluvial districts ; that cancer suiTounds the course of the groat rivers after their full formation, when they are passing through A'allcys and low-lying lands liable to floods and to the consequent accumulation of alluvial deposits. These districts are also the most densely populated. Hence it may be inferred that density of population favours the production of cancer, and that wherever social organisation is highly developed, there cancer becomes proportionately rife. But this view is not quite borne out by statistics. Thus we find that the development of cancer does not depend on mere popula- tion, as the mortality from cancer in Norwich and Great Yarmouth, com- paratively small towns, is to that in such great centres of population as Liver- pool and Manchester as 141 to 84, or nearly double ; that in Philadelphia it is to that in the much larger city of New York as 15 to 7, or more than double ; Avhile in Marylebone it is very far higher than in the capital of Pemisyh'ania. In these conclusions we must not, however, omit to take into account the increased tendency to hereditary transmission amongst a compai’atively settled population, such as that of the east of England. Is Cancer a Disease of Constitutional or of Ziocal Origin ? This cpiestion has led to much discussion among pathologists. There are at least three distinct theories with regard to the origin of cancer, a. It is a blood- disease. h. It is pmely local in its origin, c. If local in its origin, it can only be developed in a constitution that is fitted in some Avay for its formation; a fitting soil, in fact, is required for the cancer to germinate in. We will consider these views separately; and in so doing, I may observe that it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to separate the two questions as to the origin and the development of cancer from one another ; for, however essentially they may be distinct and separate, they blend themselves in such a discussion as this in an almost inextricable manner. a. That cancer is a blood-disease—a disease essentially dependent on a morbid state of the blood, is a Anew that has long been entertained by many. But in truth, this doctrine Avith regard to the origin of cancer has been made to include two distinct propositions ; the first being, that the blood itself is chai’ged Avdth the poison of cancer AA’hich is ready to burst forth or to s^wout out on any part of the body on the application of the necessary local irritation or disturbance. The second view is, that “blood-disease” and a “con- stitutional disease ” are synonymous and convertible terms. This is un- doubtedly an eiTor. It is quite possible to understand and to hold the a ieAv that the tissues of the frame are imbued Avith a cancerous tendency, Avithout having recom’se to the hypothesis that they deriA’e this from the blood. I he germinal membrane of the chick, as has been pointed out by Sir Y, Gull, takes on changes antecedently to, and independent of, the formation ol the blood. And so Ave may take it as possible that the tissues ot the bod} may inherently possess morbid or cancerous procliA'ities, independently ot the blood2. Such primary tumours arc ahvays single—no primary outbreak of OIUGIN^ OF GANGER 79^ IJY Avliich they arc nourished. But if by blood-disease be meant a disease in Avhichtlie blood actually contains the cancer-cell, as the blood m gout does the matcries morbi of that disease—uric acid circulating througii the body and capable of deposit in some locality favourable to the local development ot the malady—this hypothesis is certainly untenable. There is no cA-idence n-hatever, histologically, that the blood of any individual is a poison-bearing fluid, and has a cancerous constitution or tendency, or that, at aU events before the primary growth has developed itself, the cancer-cell, or auy material capable of undergoing cancerous development, is met with in the blood. Every phenomenon that oecims in connection with cancer may be explained without having recourse to such a hypothesis as this, which has not a particle oi^ jiathological observation on which it can be based. But if the doctrine of cancer being a blood-disease is untenable in the sense in Avhich I have here stated it, the same camiot at once be said in the way of its being primarily a constitutional aflection independently of the blood. The doctrine of the constitutional origin of cancer may be more clearly expressed in the words of Paget. “ Cancers are manifestations of certain specific and morbid states of the blood ; and in them are incorporated peculiar morbid materials which accumulate in the blood, and which their growth may tend to increase.” ^^The existence of the morbid material in the blood, whether in the rudimental or in the effective state, constitutes the general predisposi- tion to cancer ; it is that which is by some called the predisposing cause of cancer. The morbid material is the essential constituent of the cancerous diathesis or constitution ; and when its existence produces some manifest im- pairment of the general health, independently of the cancerous growth, it makes the primary cancerous cachexia.” Eor the local manifestation of this constitutional disease, the part where it is developed must be put into a favour- able condition by irritation, injury, or other similar cause. The blood-disease and the local conditions may compensate each other ; thus, with an intense cancerous diathesis, tumoiu's may be formed in such a way aud in such numbers as to be apparently independent of local conditions ; while in cases where the constitutional element exists in a low degree, a long continuance of irritation may be required to bring out its local manifestations. Paget believes that by this theory of compensation the opposing views as to the local or con- stitutional origin of cancer may be reconciled. J). The theory as to the local origin of cancer appears to be more generally adopted by Sui-geons. Velpeau, Yirchow,';De Morgan, all support or incline towards it. The arguments on which it is based may briefly be summed up as follows. They are certaiifly sufficient to account for all the phenomena of cancer ; and many of these phenomena do irot admit of explanation on any other theory. 1. Cancerous tumours spring up in indinduals who haA'C ahvays enjoyed perfect health, and who are to all appearances perfectly Avell at the time of the occmTcncc of the disease. As in these cases there is no evidence AA^hatever of constitutional affection of any kind, it Avould be a begging of the AA'hole ques- tion to assert that the existence of the local tumour must of itself be taken as an indication of a constitutional cancerous tendency.TUMOURS. 792 multiple cancel’s ever occurs. Tumours may form in certain cases in rapid suc- cession, but ne\ei simultaneously. But primary cancer does not occur at the same time at diffeient oi these seats of election—as the mamma, pylorus, and rectum, as would be the case were it constitutional. 3. Cancers arc not unfrcquently the result of some local injury or in’itation. This is a matter of daily observation in the lip, the tongue, the female breast, &c. ■ 4. The primary tumour only attacks certain organs which are the seats of irregular functional activity, as organs of generation, or certain parts of other organs, as of intestinal tubes. 5. The constitutional health does not, in the majority of cases, suffer until some months have elapsed ; when, after the lymphatics or glands have become implicated, or the neighbouring tissues invaded, but not until then, signs of cachexy set in. In many cases of cancer, especially of the mamma, the health continues excellent for many months—a year or two even after the disease has declared itself, and so long as it continues to be confined to its primary seat. It is not imtil after secondary deposits have occurred that the characteristic cachexy sets in. 6. If the primary tumoiu’ be removed before neighbom-ing parts have become contaminated, the health, if it have suffered, often improves materially. 7. Primary cancer becomes secondary or constitutional—a. By extension by continuity of tissue to neighbouring parts adjacent to primary disease • /3. Through lymphatics ; and y.

Thus, primary cncephaloid leads to deposit of encephaloid masses in the lungs ; scin’hus of the rectum to secondary scirrhus of the liver, with identical structural peculiarities. 1). Growth is favoured by local circumstances, as warmth and moistiu’c of cavities. 10. In some rare instances no recurrence whatever takes place after opera- tion, the disease being eradicated from the system, which coidd not be the case if it were constitutional. In the majority of cases, the patient remains fr’ee from recurrence of the disease for many months, or even years. 11. When recurrence does take place soon after an operation, it is almost invariably either in the cicatrix or its immediate neighbom’hood, owing to cancer-ceUs which had been widely infiltrated, or had migrated, escaping removal, and subsequently developing into new tumom’S. Were the disease constitutional, recurrence would be as likely to take place in other parts, espe- cially in symmetrical parts, or as it does when the operation has been too long delayed in internal organs. 12. We observe the same tendency to recurrence after removal, and even to seeondary deposit in distant organs, in other tumours which are incontestably primarily local, such as the sarcomata and the enchondromata, and which only become general in certain constitutions under special conditions in thcii more advanced stages, and in a secondary manner. The theory of the local origin of cancer is undoubtedly a very captivating one. It explains in the readiest and the simplest way possible most of theORIGIN OF CANCER. 793 phenomena of tho disease.

As to the Kahm,/ to recurrence after removal as will ^ stated when we come to speak of the operation for cancer, no doubt. But in truth this argument can have but little wei^^ht M-e consider the rapid tendency to diffusion that has just ^ characterising cancers above all other tnmoiu’S, oinng o e c enveloping capsule. The fact is, that the cancer-cells have already becon diffused through the neighbouring structures, and they may hai’e entered the lymphatics or the blood long before the prime j tiimoin’ has attained such a size as to attract attention or to renc er opera lo ^ If it be admitted that a cancer may commence this process of diffiision, of self-multiplication, at any period after its first formation as a distinct tumoim or gi’owth, it is impossible to deny that the recimrence of the disease^ after operation, whether local in the neighbouring areolar tissue, more distant in e lymphatic glands, or, further still in the viscera, may be due to the early spread of migratory cells, each of which has become the centre of a new recurrent growth. It would be too late to uproot the oak after the acorns had been Avidely scattered abroad. One main soince of confusion, if not of error, in respect to the origin of cancer has been, that it has usually been studied in organs, such as the mamma, in which its early origin cannot be discovered. In such a situation a tiimom’ must attain the size of a nut, at the least, before it is diagnosed or even detected. Hmv many months or ei^eii years may it liaA’e required for the first cell—not a 1,000th of an inch in diameter—to have led to the deA'elopment of such a mass as this, and how Avidely the local contamination and general infection may have spread, before such a size eimn as this is attained by the primary tumour. The rapidity with Avhich a purely local condition may infect the constitution is Avell illustrated in the case of a chancre. If once an indurated chancre has formed, the removal of the sore by excision would not save the patient from constitutional contamination, Avhich begins to take place almost from the very first moment of the formation of the true chancre. The same is probably the case Avith a cancer, Avhich, Avhen once formed, then immediately commences the infecting process. In fact, the analogy betAveen the tAvo diseases is perfect.794 TUMOURS. 2. The next point is as to the hemlilariness of cancer. As lias already been statecl, this is undoubted. But an hereditary tendency to a disease must not be confounded with a constitutional disposition to it. It is a fatal error in etiology to confound hereditariness with constitutionalism. Hcre- ditariness may be local as well as constitutional. The hereditary trans- mission of a particular feature from parent to offspring cannot be considered a proof of a constitutional tendency. So also the hereditary transmission of a malformation, as of supernumerary fingers or exostoses, is certainly purely local. But diseases may also be transmitted through descent without being in any way constitutional. Tumoims that arc not cancers are here- ditary, as ganglions, ivarts, hpomata, cnchonch’omata, &c.; sebaceous cysts of the scalp are strongly hereditary, and yet there can be no pretence that these are in any way constitutional or blood-diseases. These are instances of hei editary local diseases that arc not congenital, but develop after the body has reached maturity ; just, indeed, as a cancer does. We do not look upon these conditions as constitutional—dependent on some conditions of the blood, merely because they are transmitted from parent to offspring. All that we can at present assume is, that it is probable that in some cases there is a predisposition of imknown nature, hereditarily transmissible, which may tend to the development of cancer without the action of a known local exciting cause ; and this hereditary tendency may be local, as in a certain tissue, or iir a particular organ which is the usual seat of election of cancer, as the mamma, the testis, or the pylorus. 3. The r/reater virulence affected by cancers in some individuals than in others, and the varyintj degrees of rapidity with which they run their comse, would imdoubtedly lead to one of two inferences ; either that the primary cancer is more active, has greater inherent vitality, or that the constitution in which it occiu’s is more fiivourable to its development. That some cancers are inherently and at) initio more active, more virulent in fact than others, independently of the constitution of the individual, is evident from the greater rapidity and virulence with which some recurrent cancers will de^•elop themselves than did the parent growth. But that some constitutions may be more favourable to the development of cancer, may be a more fertile field for the primary local gTowth than others, there is every reason to believe. We see this in syphilis and tubercle. We know that there are individuals in whose constitution, when once syphilis has become engrafted, the disease assumes the most virulent and intractable form. The danger in fact of contracting a chancre varies very greatly in different in- dividuals—not owng to any difference in the primary disease, but in the soil on which it is implanted. So it is vith tubercle. This product is now kno^vii to be in many cases at least local in its origin. But it requires a fitting soil— a “ tuberculous ” constitution—in which to germinate. So it is also with the parasites that infest the human body. That all indi- viduals are not equally fitted to be their liahitat, there can be no doubt. The conditions under which ascarides, lumbrici, or skin-parasites will originate and develop, do not equally exist iii all. These parasites are undoubtedly local in their formation—a fitting soil for their growth existing in some, not in others. They are not the “ local manifestations of a constitutional ^oce,” but simply of0RIGI2T OF CANCER. 795 a morbid local state in those constitutions in which they find the necessary is\ritrcnnOT°‘ There is a tendency in the tissues of duals to iarour the development of those cancer-growths, /_ in some local in-itation, whether this be trauniahc or functional.^ ^^^to stitntional shite, whether congenital, hereditary, or acquired constitute a fitting soil for the cancerous element, m which to to develop.

The (jQogra^ihkal distriluUon of cancer has already been considerecl a p. 789. The peculiarities in this respect imdoiibtedly cut both ways—m favour of its local as well as of its constitutional origin. For it may lamly be argued that the influences resulting from soil, climate, &c., may develop a local parasitic growth, or* that they may give rise to constitutional states capable of developing a cancer. On revieu-ing the whole of this intricate question, I think wo may iairly conclude that—1, cancer is primarily n disease of local origin ; 2, it is often occasioned by the direct action of local causes ; 3, it is predisposed to by A'arioiis local conditions, physiological as well as anatomical; 4, like all other local diseases, it is under the influence of age, sex, habit of body, and here- ditary constitution ; 5, and although once originating locally its dcA elopment is favomed by constitutional conditions ; 6, there is no evidence of the existence of any constitutional state that can primarily, ]ocr se, and inde- pendently of any local cause, functional or organic, develop a cancer. There are two points in connection vdth the structure of cancer that deseiwe careful study, in reference to the question of local origin. The first is the abundant blood-supply that a cancerous tumom invariably demands and obtains ; the second is its want of a limiting capsule. The first of these points has an important bearing on its growth, the second on its diflFusion. 1. The much larger Mood-supplij that is furnished to a cancerous growth than is sent to any other kind of tumour is well knoAvn to all practical Surgeons. A scirrhus of the mannna, not larger than a pigeon’s egg, will receive a far larger vascular supply than an adenoma as large as a cocoa-nut, the number of arteries requiring ligatm’e after operation in one case being greatly in excess •of those that spout in the other. This abimdant vascular supply is noticeable in the remoA’al of the smallest cancers, but increases with the size of the tumour. The tumour itself is not usually vascular, though some cancers, as the encephaloid, are so abundantly so as to present little else than a congeries of vessels, and to possess active pulsation and bruit; but the vascularisa- tion is in the neighbouring and suiTOunding parts, in the midst of Avhich LLX OLlXJ.ULLJ.lV.4.11X^ JJCIX ilX UliU IXILVAOU it lies. It is always arterial in the deeper parts, the correspondin ig A’cnous796 TUMOURS. enlargement being nsually superficial. Now this is clifibrent from what we see ni any local manifestations of constitutional disease. In syphilitic gnmmata or tuberculosis, we see nothing like it. Now to nliat is this increased vascnlarisation of the neighbouring tissues due.'' It must be to one of two causes—either to the local in-itation produced bv the tumour, or to the supply required for the sustenance of an organism having an acti^ie groAvth inherent in its nature. That the increased vascnlarisation cannot be due to mere local irritation of a heterologous or foreign mass embedded in the tissues, is probable fi-om the fact that the local irritation excited by the mere presence of such a tumour would be equally great in others, such as lipomata, enchondromata, exostoses, &c., in which it is certainly not observed. It must therefore be due to the second of these causes, viz., the demand made by an independent organism having an inherent active vitality, capable of self- support, yet drawing its nourishment fi-om the parts amongst which it lies embedded ; and certainly this active arterial supply, this great afflrrx of blood evidently required by the tumour for its nutrition and der-elopment, and sup- plied by an active hypertemia of the neighbouring parts, is scarcely compatible with the idea of carreer beirrg arr evidence of senile degeneracy of organs or their tissrres, brrt rather that it is arr active indeperrderrt organisrrr, full of the vigour of an independent existence, and requiring a free afflrrx of blood for its rrrrtritive growth arrd highly complicated development. It is, I think, viewed fi’onr this point, a strong additional argrrmerrt in favour of the primary local originatiorr of cancer. 2. The secorrd importarrt poirrt iir conrrectiorr with the structure of a can- cerous tumour is the absence of cm enveloinng cajesnh; unlike almost every other trmrour, it is not in any way encysted or errcapsuled. There is corise- qrrerrtly rro barrier betweerr it arrd the tissrres in which it is deposited; rrothiug to limit its extension into and its absorptiorr of and conversion irrto its own structrrre of the corrtigrrorrs tissrres. The very smallest scin’hous tumour—one irot larger than a pin’s head—that carr be picked out of the scattered tubercles that rvill sometimes dissemirrate themselves through the skin iir the rreighbourhood of a scirrhous mass, is as destitrrte of a capsrrle or of arry kind of limiting envelope arorrrrd it, or of barrier thrown orrt by the neighbouring tissrre, as is the largest carreer. So, doubtless, would be such a trmroru from the very first horrr of its formation, whilst yet irrvisible to the naked eye, arrd oirly a mirrute microscopical body implanted on the tissrres. Arrd yet, from the very first moment that a cancer exists as such, it must be presrrmed to consist of those three elemoirts that corrjointly errter irrto the formatiorr of all cancers, and that constitute, not singly, brrt by their combination, a cancer, viz., cell, stroma, arrd cancer- juice. What circrrmstances or corrjrmctiou of cirerrmstarrees can possibly far‘Our more highly the diffrrsiorr throughout the neighborrring tissues arrd of the whole system of a primary growth thus constitrrted, stimulated to rapid gror\ th by arr active arterial supply, tharr the want ot a capsrrle ?

From the very first day of its formation Xin the very fii^t of the multiplication of its cells-that highly organised but fatal mioTatiiig cell may have started on its travels into areolai spaces, caiTicd on by amoeboid movements, but capable of self-support whenever arrested, there developing by an inherent and active vitality of its ovm-, ex- citino- the neighbouring arteries to furnish it with an ever increasing vascularity, and hi its new liaMut developing into a fresh cancerous centre, capable in its turn of the same process of multiplication and of local infection, which maybe indelinitely extended ; capable also, probably, of entry into the vessels, of being ciu-ried through them to distant organs, and deposited in them, like pyemic embola, forming centres of arrest and of deposit, and of multiple and new growths in the lungs or liver. _ It is this early and rapid tendency to the dissemination of cancer conse- quent on the want of an enveloping capsule, that leads to the supposition of its being constitutional. For the system may become permeated by cells shed from the parent primary tumour, before this has attained sufficient size to attract serious attention, if indeed, it has been observed at aU. But cases frequently occur in which cancer can be distinctly traced to some local cause, being immediately occasioned by a blow, injury, or other violence, or by a long-continued irritation of the part that eventually becomes affected. Thus a blow on a woman’s breast may give rise to cancer of the mamma ; and the in’itation of a broken tooth may occasion it in the tongue. It is disputed whether external causes of this kind can give rise to the production of cancer, without the previous existence of constitutional predisposition. That cancer, even when apparently excited by local causes, may in reality be of constitu- tional origin, cannot admit of a doubt; more especially in those cases in which it is hereditary, or in which it makes its appearance almost simultaneously in different parts of the body, -with a strongly marked cachexy. But in many other instances it certainly appears as if it were strictly local in its origin, as when it slowly occurs after the infliction of some violence, and ndthout any evidence of constitutional disturbance or contamination. We commonly see, for instance, a woman in perfect health receive a blow upon the breast, which gives rise to some passing inconvenience at the time; after a lapse of some months, though still with an unimpaired state of health, she notices a small hard lump. This eveiitually proves to be a scirrhous tumour. It may con- tinue stationary, or but slowly increase for months or years, until the turning point comes, at which the disease begins to contaminate the skin or the lymph- atics, and to be carried into the system, producing cachexy and giving rise to a tendency to the production of those secondary deposits of wliich we shall speak presently. In such a case as this, it is impossilfle to look on the cancer as of constitutional origin—that is, as arising from a manifest pre-existent morbid condition of the blood. Still it is difficult to nnderstaud, why an injury should in one person be followed by mere hypertemia and the conse-TUMOURS. 798 quont transitory disturbance of the nutritive ciiangcs in the part, while in anotlier the same injury is followed by cancer. We know that an exudation- coi-pusclc or a pus-cell is the result of strictly local action ; and we know also that all persons arc liable to the formation of these under favom-ablc conditions. It is true that we are ignorant of the manner in which a cancer-germ can bo liroduced by the local action of the part in which it is generated, Imt we are as little acquainted with the essential mode of production of the exudation-cell or pus-coi-puscle, which we know to be the result of strictly local action ; 'and it seems to me that the difficulty is in no way solved, but simply pushed back a step,^ by the attempt to prove that, in all cases of cancer-formation, a special condition of the blood must exist, which inipresses the cancerous character upon local actions taking place in the system. We only know that it is not every one who is liable to the formation of cancer ; and hence it is not very easy to miderstand how it should arise, unless there were some tendency to its formation some condition of the body or of the part favouring the produc- tion of those forms of gi'owth which constitute the disease. This condition may be one of such low intensity that, as far as regards the practical question of the result of removal of the tumour’, Ave may regard the disease occumng in the circumstances here considered as strictly local in its early stages, and may expect that the removal of the local disease will be followed by a more or less prolonged interval during which the patient shall remain in good health, until perhaps the disposition to the formation of cancer shall have gained sufficient intensity to again manifest itself, either sjmntaneously or as the result of some fresh form of irritation. Secondary Deposits of Cancer.-^A cancer never remains stationary. It may progress slowly or multiply rapidly. But whether its progress be slow or rapid, it is constant. The primary cancer has a tendency to multiplication, as AveU as to vegetative development of the original tumour. This multiplication of the primary growth constitutes the secondary deposits. These may take place in three ways or rather situations. 1. In the lymphatics and glands leading fr’om the primary growth. The secondai’y deposits so formed are due imdoubtedly to direct absoiiDtion of cancer-ceUs or cancer-juice, and their deposit in the neighbouring lymjAh- atics. 2. Primary cancer may multiply itself locally by the formation of more or less numerous deposits in the neighbouring cellular tissue, each being a separate nucleus or centre of new cancer-groAvth. This mode of secondary deposit may possibly be due to the cancer-cells being capable, like the white blood-corpuscles, of amoeboid movements, and thus travelling into neighbouring connective tissue spaces by their oum poAver, there to form new centres of disease. 3. The secondary deposit may occur in internal organs. The viscera Avhich are most liable to become the seat of secondary deposits are, first, the liA’er, and next the lungs. The cause of these deposits is some- Avhat obscure. Paget is of opinion that in some cases, AAffiere a rapid multipli- cation of cancers takes place, this may arise from an increase in the cancerous diathesis or morbid condition of the blood. But he believes that in most of799 TBEAT.UENT OF CANCER. these cases there has been a coin’cyance of cancerous material by the blood, in the form of embola ; and ho supports this view by referring to_ the analogy nointed out by AYalshc as existing between the secondary deposits m cancer Ld the secondary abscesses in pycemia; the liver and lungs in both cases being nrincipally affected. Ho refers also to a case of cancer of the liver, where the <rrowths were coloimed yellow by the bile, and in which he found cancerous ‘^owths of the same colour infiltrated in the lungs. This view is supported by the very important observation of Moxon, that in primaiy cancer of the rectum he has actually found in the secondary deposits in the liver evidences of the rectal origin of the deposit, in the transference with it resembling those of the rectum structures, such as Lieberkiihn’s follicles, in the secondaiy can- cerous hepatic gi-owths. So also in osteoid we find the_ secondary^ deposits in the lungs of a bony character. Paget, however, thinks that it is not necessary to suppose that entire cancer-cells are thus transferred ; cancer- juice, or minute fragments of cancer-plasma, may be as efficient as entire cells. Virchow considers that the fact that the secondary deposit does not necessarily occiu’ in the orsan through which the blood must first pass, militates against the theory that^ cancer-cells are caivied onward by the circulation, and become impacted in the smaller vessels of the part, in the manner of embola. He inclines to the belief that the cancerous juices are absorbed and enter the circulation either directly by the veins or indirectly through the lymphatics, and that they give rise to changes in the nutrition of certain parts, leading to the development of cancerous growths. But this question necessarily involves the whole doctrine of the formation of secondary deposits, whether cancerous, sarcomatous, enchondromatous, osteoid, or pyemic—are they the consequence of specific embola, or of changes wrought simply by the absorp- tion of the fluid constituents of these diseases ? I incline to the former view, and look on these secondaiy cancerous deposits just as I do the pyEemic as the direct result of embolism of a specific character in one case, of a septic in the other. This, however, is at present all matter of hypothesis. So far, however, is certain, that in whatever way we suppose the secondary deposits to be fonned, Ave may safely assume that their presence indicates that the system is charged AA'ith the material of cancer, and that the disease is no longer limited to the spot in which it first appeared. Treatmext oe Caxcer.—The treatment of cancer will necessarily bo in a great measure dependent on the view that is taken of its origin. The constitu- tionalists would necessarily and naturally endeavour to discover some method of preventing the development to or of eradicating that blood-poison, or that general tendency which they suppose underlies the local affection, and to lead to its evolution. They Avould necessarily discard operation as being not only use- less, but eiToneous in principle—as erroneous as it AA^ould be to amputate the foot to relieA'e or cure the gout. The localists, on the other hand, necessarily rely on the remoA'al of the primary local disease at as early a period as possible, as the only means of preventing secondary deposits, and consequent constitu- tional infection. Hence the discussion as to the origin of cancer has a most important practical bearing on the treatment of the disease. All Curative Constitutional Treatment is certainly utterly useless, no constitutional remedies appearing to exercise any material influence on tins disease. I amTUMOURS. 8oo not acquainted with any case of cancer, either from my own ohservatious, from conversation with other Surgeons, or from published statements, tliat affords satisfactory evidence of cure by an internal remedy. It is true that many so- called cases of cancer have, at various times, been stated to haA'e been cured by different medicines ; but it must be borne in mind that, in a less advanced state of pathological knoAvlcdge than exists at the present day, almost all hard chronic tumours were called “ scirrhous,” and many intractable ulcers “ can- cers ” ; mistakes which arc not unfrequently committed, and sometimes un- avoidably so, even with the improved means of diagnosis that we at present possess. Not one of the many remedies that have been vaunted as being specific in this disease, and by Avhich cures have been stated to haA'e been effected, has retained the confidence of the profession, or has, on further trial, corresponded in its effects to the statements of those Avho introduced it. I therefore think it but waste of time to discuss the supposed advantage to be derived from hemlock, sanguinaria, condurango, iron, arsenic, iodine, cod-liver oil, or lemon-juice, in the treatment of cancer. But though cmutNe treatment can effect nothing in these cases, much may be effected in cases that do not admit of operation toAvards retarding the progress of the disease by proper Palliative Treatment. With this view, the diet should be mild, nutritious, easy of digestion, unstimulating, and sufficient to support the strength under the wearing influence of pain and discharge ; and the preparations of opium, of conium, and of hyoscyamus, must be freely administered in order to reheve the patient’s sufferings, and to procure rest. The Local Means are those upon which the Surgeon justly places the chief reliance in these affections. The PaUiative Local Treatment consists in the use of means calculated to retard the growth of the tumour, to lessen the pain attending it, and to remove the feetor that arises if it be ulcerated. In order to prevent the rapid extension of the tumour, it is of gveat importance to subdue all local excitement within and around it; in proportion to the amount of action existing in the part, the disease Avill usually extend Avith rapidity ; any inflammatory condition of the neighboming tissues being espe- cially prejudicial in this respect. Hence, in these circumstances, the occasional application of a few leeches Avill often be of considerable service. No counter- irritation, however, ought to be employed in the vicinity of the cancerous imrt, as it only excites action in and aroiuid it, and hastens the process of ulceration; the skin especiaUy is apt to become rapidly infiltrated by the cancerous disease If. if irritated bv tlie annhcation of iodine and other stimulants.

Q 8oi wliich opiates may bo ach'aiitageoiisly added with a view of lessening the Curative Local Treatment of eancer embraces three methods, viz. : destruction by caustics ; absorption by pressure ; and removal by the knife. All these local means are employed on one principle ; viz., on the supposition that the cancerous tumour which it is proposed to destroy, to absorb, or to extirpate, is primaiily a local disease : that, if this local malady can be removed sutticiently early, constitutional infection may be prevented ; and that, even if this have to some extent taken place, fatal contamination of the system may be retarded by the removal of the local source of that constitutional infection. The great objection that has been urged against operating in this disease is, that cancer being assimied to bo from the first a constitutional affection, it is useless to remove the local tumour, leaving the constitutional vice um’eheved. If this objection Avere tenable, it would apply to the removal of cancers in any Avay, and Avould have as much force against removing cancerous growth by caustic, by pressiu-e, or by congelation, as against extirpating them by the simpler and speedier means of the knife, and in fact must lead to the conclusion that none but local palliatives are proper in this disease. For such an argument as this to have any value, it must first be shmni that cancer is ahvays ah origm& a disease depending on the actual presence in the blood of a certain morbid material, and that it is not in many cases primarily local, in so far that any tendency to the formation of cancer has strictly limited its action to the part, where we find the cancer developed. The arguments which have ah’eady been adduced, however, and the results of experience, appear to me to be conclusive- as to caneer being, for aU surgical piu’poses, primarily a local disease, and only beeoming constitutional secondarily by contamination of the blood and absorp- tion into the system, and consequently to justify operation for the removal of cancerous tumours in suitable cases. Caustics.—The employment of caustics for the destruction of cancers has,, in all ages and countries, been resorted to by empirics, who profess to remove- tumours of a malignant nature, by secret remedies, less painful and more effec- tual than the knife. As their application, to use Yelpeau’s expression, requires neither a knowledge of anatomy nor of operative surgery, these remedies have- always been popular Avith many who have neither the kncAA-dedge nor the skill to use the knife. In this country, hoAvever, they have never enjoyed any A'ery extended reputation ; and in fact they have, perhaps, not been legitimately employed to the extent that they deseiwe, especially in ulcerated and reciuTent cancers, or in those so situated on the skin and muco-cutaneous surfaces as not to admit of being very readily or safely extirjpated by operation. The great objection to the use of caustics has been the scAmity and the con- tinuance of the pain induced by them, Avhich lasts not only for hoiu’s, but for- days—more intense and prolonged than any occasioned by the knife ; and as it is usually necessary, in order to destroy effectually the morbid groAvth, to repeat the application of the caustic several times, the suflPering is often greater than the most resolute patient can submit to. The chief argument in favour of the use of caustics is the statement, that cancers thus destroyed are less liable to reciu' than when extiiiAatcd by the:TUMOURS. 8o2 Iviiife. Ihere is, however, no positi^•o eviclenee before us in proof of the truth of this opinion. It is not improbable that the chemical action of the caustics ' ]uay extend so widely into neighbouring tissues as to destroy or render unpro- ductive the cancer-cells or cancerous plasma by which they are infiltrated, and on the development of which the local recurrence of the disease depends. But it is impossible to believe that the mere method of removal of the local disease' can influence the constitutional nature of the cancer. If secondary infection have taken jilace, it can signify very little whether the local disease be extir- pated by the knife or by caustics. If no cachexy exist, it appears to me that the patient must be equally safe in ivhatever vny the local disease is removed, provided it be thoroughly and effectually extirpated. Another advantage .urged in favour of caustics, in the coiTectness of which 'Velpeau acquiesces, is, that enlarged lymphatic glands are more likely to go down under their use than when the primary cancer is extirpated by the knife. Some of the advocates of the use of caustics in the treatment of cancer pretend that the particular agent employed exercises on the morbid structure a specific action, which is cnnfinp.fi to it, and does not extend to the neighbomiug healthy tissues. But this asser- tion is entirely destitute of fouWation. • . The caustics that have been and that are employed in the treatment of cancers are very various. They cannot be used indiscriminately, and consequently we must briefly consider them separately. 1. The concentrated mineral acids, especially the fuming nitric and anhydrous sulphuric acids, are often advantageously employed. The concentrated nitric acid may be usefully applied to small superficial cancerous ulcers; it rapidly destroys the tissues, and does not spread too -widely, but it is not potent enough for the destruction of tumoiu’S. The glacial sulphuric acid, made into a white paste with asbestos, as used by Michel, or rubbed into a black paste mth powdered safifon,js the caustic which Velpeau extols as the most efficient in cancerous tmnoiu’S, more particularly those of a fungating or bleeding kind. It converts the part to which it is applied into a thick, hard, carbonised eschar, with but little surrounding inflammation ; and, as its action is rapid, the pain is not pro- longed. On the separation of the hard slough, a healthy granulating cavity Avill be left, which cicatrises rapidly with much contraction. It also acts as a hsemostatic, rapidly shiiveUing and drying up large bleeding and discharging fungi. 2. The caustic allcalies, especially potash and lime, either alone or in combi- nation, in the shape of the Vienna paste, or fused into sticks, are very energetic in their action ; but they have the disadvantage of spreading widely if applied to a large siuface, and, by softening or dissol-ving the parts, giving rise to a tendency to hmmorrhage. They may, however, be adv’antageously applied to small cancers of the face. 3. Various mineral salts, more particularly the chlorides of antimony, zinc, and bromine, the acid nitrate of merciuy, and arsenious acid, arc often employed with much success in the treatment of cancerous rfleers and growths. Of the various chlorides, that of zinc is the most usefid. This is applied by being made into a paste containing one part of the chloride to foiu parts ot floiu, moistened with a little water, or by the pine chloride slightly moistened being spread on strips of lint. It must, in order to act, be applied to a rawLOCAL TREATMENT OF CANCER. 803 surface : hence ifc is customary first to destroy the skin Avith nitrjc acid, and then to apply the chloride. Cancpioin states that a paste, made of equal parts of the chloride and of flour, four lines in thickness, and applied for forty-eight houi-s, destroys the parts to the depth of an inch and a half. ^When of less strength and substance, its action is proportionately limited. There are tAVO methods by Avhich a tumoiu- may be attacked and destroyed by caustic paste : cither at or from the circumference, or from the centre. When the tumour is hu-ge and rapidly gi-OAving, it may be most adA'antageously destroyed fr’om the circumference, at its junction Avith the healthy tissues. This may be done by the plan adopted by MaisonueuA-e—of making the paste into small sticks, or pencils, Avhich ai-e pushed deeply and at short interA'als into the substance of the tumour around its circumference, so that its tissue becomes penetrated by the action of the caustic in all directions, and its totality thus rapidly destroyed. In small tumours, and those that groAA' AAuth less rapidity, in Avhich there is no great risk of the rapidity of their groAvth overtaking and passing beyond the destructive effects of the caustic, the paste may be applied to and aroiuid the ■centre, and the disease in this manner extirpated. In other cases, the tumour may be deeply and rapidly attacked by applying, a layer of the chloride of zinc paste over the AA'hole of its surface. The slough produced by this application is then incised, or scored longitudinally at equal distances of about half an inch, until the parts beneath, to A\'’hich the caustic has not penetrated, are reached by the incisions so made : j)ieces of lint covered Avith the deliquesced chloride are put into them, and aftei-Avards fr-esh incisions are made until the cauterising influence has extended to the bottom of the tmnom’, Avhich finally sloughs out in a mass. Of the utility of the chloride of zinc as a caustic, there can be no doubt; but the chief objection to its use lies in the intensity and continuance of the pain occasioned by it. This, hoAvever, maybe lessened by an admixture ■of about a sixth part of morphia, or, as L. Parker has suggested, by freezing the pai’t before the caustic is applied, and continuing the appheation of the fr-igorific mixture during the time of the action of the caustic. Landolfi has recommended the use of the chloride of bromiue in combination AAuth those of gold and zinc ; but this caustic does not appear to possess any decided advan- tage over the simple chloride of zinc, and is objectionable on account of the fumes evolved dining its use. Arsenic exercises a poAverfrd action upon cancerous groAvths, and is the chief ingTcdient in many of the secret preparations used by empirics ; it is, hoAvever, a dangerous agent, and excites great inflammation and pain. If too fr’eely used, it may induce poisoning, and not a fcAv deaths have resulted in this Avay ; it should, accordingly, not be applied at any one time to a surface exceeding a shilling in size. The most convenient mode of applying it appears to be Manec’s paste, composed of one part of arsenious acid to eight of cinnabar und foiu’ of blunt sponge, rubbed doAAui to a proper consistence AAuth a little Avatcr. SuliAiate of zinc, dried, finely levigated, and made into a paste AAuth glycerine, or an ointment AAuth lead, has been very strongly recommended by Simpson, as one of the most efficient and convenient of all caustics in rodent and cancerous ulcers. In action it someAvhat resembles the chloride of zinc, but is less painful. 3 P 2TUMOUBS. 8o4 Of all those caustics, T should certainly say that the deliquesced chloride of ziuc is the safest and most efficacious, more particularly -when a scin-hous tumour has to be destroyed. When au encephaloid fungus has to l)e attacked, the concentrated sulphuric acid is preferable, omng to its coagulating and hiemostatic properties. When small cancerous sores have to be destroyed, the nitric acid, the arsenical paste, or the chloride of zinc, made into a paste noth flour and morphi<a, may very conveniently be used. Compression is a plan that has been alternately greatly extolled and much depreciated. It v^as fully tried at the Middlesex Hospital, by Young, more than fifty yeai-s ago, and unfavourably reported upon by Sir Charles Bell at that time ; it consequently fell into disuse in this countiy, but was revived by Eecamier in France, and employed larg’ely by him. Although he published a favourable account of this practice, it made but little progress amongst French surgeons; the oifly one who seems to have used it to any extent being Tanchou, who employed a peculiar topical medication conjoined vith it. In this comitry the practice fell into complete oblivion, until J. Amott some years ago invented a mode of employing pressm-e by means of an elastic air-cushion ; since which time it has been often employed with varyina: desTees of success. In employing pressure. Young principally had recourse to plasters and bandages. Eecamier used amadou applied with an elastic roller ; and Tanchou recommended spring-pads, under which small bags or pieces of cotton-wadding impregnated -with various medicinal substances were placed, so as to protect the skin and act upon the tumoiu’. Amott’s plan consisted of pressure exercised by a Macintosh air-bag, held in its place by straps, and pressed upon by a truss- spring, the pressure exercised by which was made to vary from two-and-a- half to twelve or even sixteen pounds. These different plans should not be employed indiscriminately, but may all be of service in particular cases. I have employed them all, but have never found permanent advantage from any of them. The first question that necessarily arises in reference to the emj)loyment of pressme in these cases is, whether it can effect a cure. This it could oifiy be expected to do by producing atrophy, and subsequent absorption, in the strictly local forms of cancer. The only case on record, with any pretension to a conclusive character in this respect, is one related by Walshe in his excellent Treatise on Cancer, of a cure of a tumour of the breast believed to be caucerous, by compression. But even this instance I cannot look upon as by any means conclusive ; for, although no one can entertain a higher oj)inion than I d© of the very remarkable- diagnostic skill possessed by Walshe, yet I think there can be no doubt in the mind of any Siu’geon that it is absolutely impossible to determine in many cases, by any amount of knowledge or skill, the true nature of a chronic tumour of the breast ; and, in fact, the most experienced practitioners fre- quently find, after the removal of the tumour, that it was of a different character from what they had previously anticipated. This difficulty at- taches to Walshe’s case ; and I think that there is no proof that the tiunour of the breast, which underwent absorption under the pressure of Arnott’s ai^paratus, was of a truly cancerous nature, and that it was not a chronicEXCISION OF CANCER. ^°S mammary tummm, or some similar gr-owtlr which, as every one knows, whll fl is'Tnneiir under tliis kind of treatment. But if compression cannot be shown c^'er to have cured a cancel, can i no retard’thc proo'ress of this disease, or relieve the snlferings attendant upon it. I believe that in some cases it may certainly do both, though m others it is as unquestionably injurious. It appears occasionally to retard the growth of the tumour when applied in the early stage, simply by preventing- hs expansion, and perhaps by compressing its nutrient vessels, and so dimmishmg^the supply of blood sent to it, and by causing absorption of smrounding inflammatory infiltration ; in these cases likewise it relieves for a time the pain by lessening the tm-o-escence of the part. In other cases, however, I have known it to act injm-iously by pressing out and diffusing the tumour more widely, appearing to increase the tendency to implication of neighbouring parts, and occasioning o-reat suffering. When the tumoiu' is ulcerated, or if the skin covering it be Tnflamcd, prcssiu-e cannot be employed with any advantage ; and most com- monly iiritable sensitive patients cannot support the constriction of the chest that it necessitates. i, i Excision.—With regard to the question of removing cancers by the knife, much difference of opinion exists amongst Sm-geons ; for, though aU deprecate indiscriminate recoiu’se to this means, some go so far as to dispute the propriety of ever operating for this disease, whilst others would restrict the operation to certain cases of a favourable character. These divergences are necessarfly of considerable importance, and require attentive examination. The objections that have been urged against the general propriety of operating in cases of cancer, do not apply so much to the operation itself, the risk attending which is not greater than that of other operations of similai magnitude, but are rather based on the supposition that cancer is originaUy a constitutional affection, and that the patient is consequently liable to speedily suffer from a return of the disease, so that an operation that is at least unnecessary wiU have been performed. This objection, however, as has already been remarked, equally applies to all other means of local removal, as by caustics or compression, as well as to extirpation by the knife ; and, if cai-ried to its logical conclusion, must necessarily preclude any attempt at removal, by any means, of the local disease. That this objection, so far as the liability to rctiun of the cancerous disease after operation is concerned, is to some degree a vahd one cannot be gainsaid ; the experience of all Surgeons tending to establish the fact, that the majority of patients operated upon for cancer die eventually, and usually within a limited time, from a reciuTence of the disease. Thus, A. Cooper states, that in only nine or ten cases out of a hundred did the disease not return in three years ; and Brodie has found that it generally proves fatal in two or three years after the operation. After removal of the original cancerous tumoiu-, the disease may return in one of three situations, viz. : in the cicatrix ; in the neighboiuing lymphatic glands, with or ivithout implication of the cicatrix ; or in internal organs. The mode of recurrence in these different parts is obvious enough. When the disease returns in the cicatrix, it is owing to local causes ; either to the original cancer having been imperfectly removed, when recurrence Avill take place before the wound is healed, or very shortly after this event; or toTUMOURS. 8o6 the widely spread infiltration of cancer-germs tlirougli tissues that had a healtliy appearance, when recim-ence will take place after a lapse of some weeks oi> months, in the shape either of uniform infiltration of the cicatricial tissue, which assumes the appearance of an elevated hard ridge of a pui-plish-red colour, or of nodules which rapidly coalesce. When it recurs in the lijm]]halic fjlands, it is because they were infiltrated with the cancer-geims before the removal of the original tumour. They become hard, and often develop into secondaiy growths, rivalling the primary disease in size and rapidity of gi-owth. hen the secondary deposit takes place in internal organs, it is usually met with in the liver or the lungs. In such cases it is reasonable to presume that cancer-ceUs or portions of cancer-plasma enter the blood, arc carried into the general current of the circulation, and are deposited in these organs, there forming the rruclei of new growths. Eecmrerrt carreer, in whatever situation it may occru-, is more rapid irr its corrrse than the primary form of the disease. It may prove fatal in various ways ; by exhaustion from local discharges or hemorrhage ; by the induction of arr anemic cachexy, in which the nutritioir of the system becomes so impaired that death results from inanitiorr ; or by the inductiorr of internal disease of an acute character, as low pneumonia, pleuritic effusion, or ascites, according as the irrternal deposit is thoracic or abdomirral. The disease is especially apt to reem* soon if the skin have become involved, if the lymphatic glands be enlarged, or if there have been constitutional cachexy before the operation ; also if the tumoiu’ be gTOvdng rapidly at the time of removal, and especially if the patient be robust and strong, with a florid complexion. In determining the adrisability of operating in cases of cancer, several ques- tions of great importance present themselves to the consideration of the Siu’geon. He has first to consider whether the operation is hkely to rid his patient com- pletely of the disease ; or, in the event of its not doing so, whether life may not be prolonged by the removal of the cancerous tumom*; or, lastly, whether his sufferings may not be much lessened by the removal of the local affection, although there be no prospect of really prolonging life. The principle on which all operations for the removal of cancer are under- taken is this : either that, the disease being local ai) origins, the constitutional and secondary manifestations can be prevented by a timely removal of the local and primary deposit; or that, even if the tumour be the result of a con- stitutional predisposition or vice roused into activity by local causes, the exci- sion of this morbid deposit removes from the system a new centre and soui’ce of constitutional infection ; so that, if the operation be unsuccessful in completely eradicating the disease, it may yet be productive of much good in preventing the contamination of the system from this new centre of mox’bid action. The two following questions will therefore present themselves to the Surgeon in considering this subject. 1. Can cancer be cured, or rather completely extirpated from the system by excision ? That in some cases a cancerous tumour may be removed with eA'eiy expec- tation of the patient being completely freed fr-om^ the disease, cannot, I think, be doubted ; although it may be true that such instances are rare. Yet they do occasionally fall under the observation of Surgeons, and certainly seem to807 result of operation on GxiNGER. „ n,-t fhc -iircction is not in all cases constitutional, and that, if happily r 1 sl“l„„ving it during its local condition th™ is a go^d p.- f fimf tVio nifcicnt may be rescued from a return of the affection. p sirtcs that he has perfectly cured patients by the removal of cancerous tumours -at least, that no return has taken place for 12,15 or 20 years extuTa^ The evidence of Brodie on this point is extremely valuable ; Aviitin„ in 1840, • L a ei-iloo tint “So Ion" a"0 as 1832,1 removed abreast that eminent Surgeon states, that &o ion„ „ _ , affected ivitli a scinhons tnmoiii-, and the lac y is still m tsOp Avas so last year Since the operation she has married, and had chiicUen. Tnst icai-1 was^called to see a lady on account of another complaint, on ivhom I ptflZcd tlTe oim-ation thirteen years ago, and found that she continued Le ft-om the old Lease ; and, Tciy lately, I have heard of another lady vtase scirrhous breast I removed six years ago, and_ Avho_ continues well. T opinion of Fergusson is also very positive on this point and he speaks in < tone with which I perfectly agree. He says ; ‘‘ Nevertheless, as excision gives the only chance of seciirity-a point on ivhich most pm-ties seem to a^ee-an operation should alivays be resorted to, proAuded the knife can be carried b jond the supposed Mmits of the disease ; and, moreover, I deem it one of the diffies of the practitioner to lU’ge the patient to submit to such a proceeding, opinion of these eminent Siwgeons, supported as it is by the general practice of the profession, tends to show that in some cases, at least, the disease may le extirpated fr’om the system by excising the tumour before the constitution has become impheated. , tj, , ^ a 2. If cancer cannot be actuaUy cured by excision, may not life be prolonged and health improved by an operation ? , , . • t I am decidedly of opinion that this is possible ; and that, though a patient may at last be carried off by some of the reemrent forms of cancerous disease, health may have been improved, life may haA^e been prolonged, and much suffering may have been spared, by a timely operation.^ It may often be observed that, after the cancer has been removed, the digestion becomes stronger and the patient gains flesh ; the colour of the complexion retiu’ns, and the spirits greatly improve ; the system being relieA'ed from a source of local irritation, and the mind fr’om a cause of disquietude that has undermined the general health of the patient. This is more particularly the case in encephalokl cancer, in AAfrich early remoA'al of the disease is luiqiiestionably successful, in many cases, in prolonging life. The observations of Paget on this point are peculiarly A’aluable. He states the aA^erage dimation of life of those patients laboinlng under this form of disease, in Avhom the primary affection is removed, to bo about twenty-eight months ; AA'hilst the aA^erage life of those in Avhom the disease is allowed to run its course, is not more than tAA’o years. I think that the introduction of ana3sthetic agents into operative surgery has very materially affected the bearings of this important question. So long as an operation Avas a source of great pain, and of much consequent anxiety and dread, a Surgeon might very properly hesitate to subject his patient to severe suffering Avith so doubtful a result ; but noAV that a patient can be freed by a painless procedure fr-om a source of great and constant annoyance, discomfort, and suffering, the Surgeon may feel himself justified in thus affordingTUMOURS. SoS I or years of comptu-ative case, though he may be fully aware that, at tlm expiration ot that time, the attcction may retm-ii, and will then certainly prove latal. Even under these circumstances, the patient’s condition may be much improved ; for the recurrent is frequently less distressing than the primary disease, since, as it often takes place in internal organs, it is not attended with the same amount of local pain and distress. In discussing the propriety of operating in a case of cancer, the Surgeon can, however, have little to do with general or abstract considerations. He has to deterrnine what had best be done in the particular case ; and it wll serve him little, in coming to a conclusion as to the line of practice that he should adopt, to refer to the statistics of the gross results of operations, or to general com- parisons between the results of cases that are not operated upon and those that are. The whole question narrows itself to the point, as to what should best be done in order to jirolong tlie life, or relieve the sufPering, of the particular individual whose case is being considered. In order to come to some definite conclusion on this, it is necessary to classify the different cases of cancer, and to arrange them under the heads of those in which no operation is justifiable ; those in which the result of any such procediu'e would be very doubtful; and those in which an operation is attended with a fair prospect of success. 1. Cases not proper for Opieration.—a. The operation ought never to bo per- formed in cases where several cancerous tumours exist in different parts of the body at the same time. Here the disease is evidently constitutional, and can- not be eradicated by any series of operations, h. If the cancerous cachexy be strongly marked, or if the disease be hereditary, it is useless to remove a local affection ; as the malignant action will certainly manifest itself elsewhere, or, perhaps, even speedily retimi in the cicatrix, c. If the timioim be of very rapid growth, and be still increasing, there would appear to be so vigorous a local tendency to cancerous deposit, that it will speedily develop itself again in the cicatrix, d. If the tumour be so situated that it cannot be completely and entirely extirpated by cutting widely into the surrounding parts, it ought not to be meddled with ; othenvise the affection will to a certainty return in the wound before it has closed. It is necessary to remove not only the tumour, but the surrounding tissues to some extent, even though apparently healthy. e. If the whole of the affected organ, as a bone, cannot be removed, or if the skin and glands be involved, it is useless to attempt the extirpation of the growth, as a speedy relapse will certainly ensue. /. In the very chronic and indurated cancers of old people, it is often well not to interfere, as in these cases the affection makes such slow progress, that it does not appear in any way to shorten life, and the mere operation might be attended with serious risk at an advanced age. 2. Doubtful Cases.—Those cases in which the result of an operation is extremely doubtful, but in which no other means offer the shghtest px’ospect of relief, have next to be considered, a. Cancers of the eye, tongue, and testes, belong to this category ; for, though more liable to return than similar affec- tions of any other part of the body, yet they may be considered fit cases for operation, inasmuch as in no other way has the jxatient the slightest chance of being relieved from his disease, b. In cancers that ara already ulcerated, the Surgeon may sometimes operate in order to giA'e the patient ease from jxi’esent809 CASES PROPER FOR OPERATION. „ „r Mi'lrais asiii6omccasesi-ecor(lodbyBrodio,witlia.-iewofpi-o- snffcim , , p 1 . expectation of affecting a permanent eme. ‘“■f'le « be so large, or be so sitnated, that its removal cannot be mitetaken without so serious an oircration as to occasion m itself consideiablo vitik fhe m’owietv of operating is cilways A ciy doubtful. 3’ Cases proper for Oj)eratio7i.—nio&Q cases of cancer in which an operation is in my opinion, not only perteotly iustfflable, bnt should be m'ged upon the mtient as Uording the best prospect of preserving life, are those in which the disease has appeai-ed to originate h-om a strictly local cause in P™® irise ill good health, and in whom there is no cachexy or hereditaiy taint.

In aU encephaloid cancers also, early operation should be practised -Ruth the view of prolonging hfe. • n i p An important question in connection with operations for cancer is, at what period of the growth they may be done with the best prospect of success. Most Sm-geons, taking a common-sense view of this question, are in fayoin of removing the affection as early as possible ; feehng that, as it is difficult to say when the local form of the disease becomes constitutional, it is safer to remove it as soon as its true natine has been ascertained.; and I confess that I can see no ad^■antage that can be gained by delay. The necessity for eaily operation in nudullary cancer is admitted by aU ; but with regard to scirrhous cancer the opinion is entertained by some, that in many cases there is a better prospect of success if the operation be delayed ; and it is stated by Hervez de Chegoin and Leroy d’Etiolles, that the result of those cases operated on after the cancer has lasted for some time, is more favourable than that of those in which an early operation has been done ; the cancer often appearing to be arrested in its development, and to localise itself, as it becomes more chronic, and having consequently a less tendency to speedy return after removal. That the result of operations in such selected cases is favoinable, is probable enough ; as it may be reasonably supposed that the more active varieties of cancer, those that possess the greatest amount of vegetative activity and of reproductive power, may have acquired a condition unfavourable to operation, or may even have carried off' the patient before any period of arrest in their growth has occurred, during which their extirqratioir could be practised with a fair pros- pect of success. In delaying operation there is, however, much danger lest A aluable time be lost iir the employment of means which, ineffectual in arrest- ing the disease, may become positively injurious by allowing time to the morbid growth to corrtaminatc the glandrdar system, or to extend widely through neighboiu’ing tissues. If we look uporr a cancer as a growth which must necessarily destroy life, either by changes taking place in its own sub- stance or by the contamination of the system, and which is intractable to all medication, whether topical or constitutional, wc must regard its extirpation as the only resource that Surgery offers ; and wc may assuredly infer, that theTUMOURS. liahility to constitutional infection and wide-spread local contamination will )jc less in proportion to the early remo'S'al of the morbid mass. EPITHELIOMA. Epithelioma, though closely allied to the true cancers, differs from them in so many important respects that it requires to be considered as a distinct affection. It resembles the true cancers in its tendency to local infiltration and ulceration, in its extension to the lymphatic system, and in the induction of death by cachexy. It differs from them in its anatomical structure, in being ini’ariably seated in the mucous, muco-cutaneous, and more rarely the cutaneous structures—always primarily on a mucous or cutaneous surface, where epithelial cells are natimally found, and in its being rarely attended by secondary deposits in the yiscera. Some Avriters haA'e gone so far as to deny any relationship betAA'een epithelioma and the true cancers, and others again have looked upon it as a semi-cancerous formation (cancroid of Virchowj ; there can be no doubt, howei'er, that it is a true cancer, for forms intermediate in structure between it and sciiThus are not unfrequently found. Epithelioma must be carefully distinguished from simple papilloma ; though this is not ahvays easy, for as on one side epithelioma may merge into scirrhus, on the other it passes by insensible gradation towards the simple wart. In epithe- lioma the epithehum is found not oidy groAving on the surface of the skin or mucous membrane, but forcing its Avay downwards amongst the parts beneath in cylindrical or irregular processes, forming so-called cancer-cylinders. Probably many tumoiu’s, ultimately cancerous, pass through a stage undistin- guishable from a simple warty growth. Situation and Progress.—Epithehoma, rare in the young, is common in middle-aged or elderly people, the tendency to it increasing in proportion as age adA’anccs. In this respect it follows the course of other cancers. It is generally occasioned by the long-continued or frequently repeated appheation of some source of irritation, and may thus be established in constitutions other- wise perfectly healthy. Thus, the irritation of a broken tooth upon the tongue or cheek may produce epithehoma of those parts. The scrotum in chimney- SAveepers not unfrequently becomes the seat of epithelioma, in consequence of the lodgment and irritation of soot in its rugte. The muco-cutaneous smfaces are its true habitat; it chiefly occurs in the lips (Fig. 310), tongue, mouth, eye- lids, penis. Angina, and anus. It is, hoAvever, also met AAuth in the cutaneous surfaces of the face, the hands, the feet, and the scrotmn ; and, indeed, may occur upon any cutaneous surface, although there can be no doubt that those tubercles and malignant ulcerations that occur in the purely cutaneous sm- faces of the extremities and trunk are occasionally sciirhous. It commences either as a small flat tubercle or wart, AA'hich rapidly ulcerates ; oi it appears from the first as an intractable fissure or ulcer of limited size, Arith hard and everted edges, and a foul surface. Such an ulcer as this may not only attack and destroy the soft parts in its neighbourhood, but may equally pioduce its destructive action on bones, penetrating deeply into their structure and eroding them. It sloAvly spreads, and appears at first to be local; but after a time, contaminating the glands in the neighbourhood, it induces cachexy, ancSITUATION OF EPITHELIOMA. acstroTS the patient by exhaustion.

In fact, from any part of the body that is naturally provided with epithelium, and from such surfaces only, epithelioma may be developed. The only apparent exception to its occurrence on the surftices covered by epithelial or epi- 3io.-Br.theiioma of Lower ui-. dermic scales vdth which I am acquain- ” siiUe: about 21. ted, is its appearance as a submucous tumoiu’ in the mouth and uterus, of which I have more than once seen instances in both of these situations; the tiunom’s varying in size from a cheny to a small walnut, round, pedimculated, and fibrous looking, but presenting after removal the characteristic epithehomatous structure.

Extensive secondary c eposits in tlie lymphatic glands in the idcinity of the parts all’ected, even deep in the snbmaxillary, iliac, and pelvic regions, invariably take place after the disease has lasted for some time. Structure.—On microscopic examination, an epithelioma will be found to be composed of masses of cells of the type of squamous epithelium, forming irre- gularly cylindi’ical processes communicating with each other. From the irregu- lar-course of these processes, they are cut in a variety of directions in everythin section, so that the groups of cells do not give the idea of cylinders, but rather of circidar, oval, and irregular masses not in direct connection with each other. Between these cylinders is a fibrous tissue bearing abundant vessels for the nutrition of the non-vascular epithelimn. This fibrous tissue is more or less infiltrated with small round cells, in proportion to the rapidity of the growth of the tiunour. It vdll be seen from the above description that the structure of an epithelioma, although differing in detail, is in the main similar to that of sciirhous and encephaloid cancer ; that is to say, cells of an epithelial type, imbedded in spaces in a fibrous stroma, which freely commimicate with each other (Fig. 311). As ill normal squamous epithehum covering a papilla of the skin, the cells next'to the fibrous and vascular tissue are softer and roimder in form than those of greater age. In the centre of the terminal portion of a cylinder of cells or in a branching process from it, the epithelium often becomes flattened by pressure, and arranged circularly so as to form a globe (epithelial nests, epithelial pearls). These nest-like for- mations are produced, according to Virchow, by the remarkable tendency to endogenous cell-growth exhibited by some of these cells, and the develop- ment of large “brood-spaces” within them. The pressime produced by this formation of brood-spaces, and the endogenous cell-growth accompanying it, causes the cells to become flattened and to take on a concentric arrange- ment. Possibly these globes may be formed in both ways ; but the appearance usually presented by them rather sug- gests the former than the latter pro- cess, as the central parts are most fr-e- quently dry and hard, and present no signs of active growth. Similar globes are not unfrequently formed in simple warty growths, and must therefore not be considered absolutely diagnostic of epithelioma. The tully formed cells often present beautifully serrated edges, the serrations of one inteidigitat- ing with those of its neighbours. This is well shown in the accompanying drawing (Fig. 312), taken fr-om a small epithelioma of the anus which I removed in University College Hospital. The individual cells ol an epithelioma, as obtained by scraping, differ but little from the healthy scaly epithelium that FiiJ. 312.—Bpitlieliouiii of Amis (ISS diani.)

Thiersch and AValdeyer believe that they have demonstrated a lymphatic endothelium covering the cylinders of cells, and consequently beheA e that the epithelium is actuaUy Avithin lymph - spaces. The anastomosis betAveen the cancer-cylinders is said exactly to resemble that normally seen betAveen the lymph-spaces. Koster believes that the epithelium of the cancer is in reahty produced by multiplication of the lymphatic endotheliiun. Although the local characters of an epithehoma may in some cases be- distinguishable Avith difficulty from those of true cancer, there is a very important pathological difference betAveen the tAvo diseases ; for in ejiithelioma those secondary afl’ections of the Auscera Avhich are so conmion in and charac- teristic of true cancer rarely occur. When epithelioma proAPS fatal, it is usuahy by the progress of the local disease ; by its extensive ulceration ; by the contamination of the neighbouring lymphatic glands ; and by the conse- quent induction of a constitutional cachexy and malnutrition, Avith exhaustion of the system. But those secondary tumours Avhich are met Avith in the- hver, lungs, &c., indicative of a deeper contamination of the system than is shoAvn by glandular deposits, and Avhich are the characteristic and almost invariable accompaniment of other forms of cancer, seldom occur in epithe- homa. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of epithelioma fr’om the other forms of cancer is not alAvays easy. The prineipal points that should guide the Siu’geon are ; 1. The almost invariable occurrence of the epithelioma on the mucous or muco-cutaneous siu’faces. 2. Its early ulceration ; often from the Amy commencement, as the primary form of the disease. 3. The rapidity Anth Avhich ulceration foUoAvs on the neAV groAVth, so that the disease may appear to spread by ulceration rather than by new deposit, 4. The origin of the disease from some eAudent source of external irritation. 5. The absence of ah evidence of contamination of internal organs. In making the diagnosis, it must be borne in mind that scinhus, Avhen affecting the mucous or cutaneous surfaces, usuahy com- mences as a tubercle ; and that, Avhen this ulcerates, the base of the ulcer has a hard and deeply infiltrated feel, extending for some distance into the- tissues, Avhereas epithelioma is superficial, and is ulcerated rather than tuber- culatcd and infiltrated. The Prognosis of epithelioma is far more favomable than that of true cancer in any of its varieties. Treatment.—The treatment of epithelioma is much more satisfactory than that of the other varieties of carcinomatous disease Avhich aa-c have just beenT 814 TUMOURS. considering, inasmucli as tliis partakes more of tlie characters of a local, and less of a constitutional affection, than the other forms of cancer. Constitutional treat- ment is, I belieye, as ineffectual in epithelioma as in the other forms of cancer • but early and free removal by excision or ligatm-e, or complete destruction l)y caustics, will not uncommonly permanently rid the patient of this aflection. Indeed, if the operation be done sufficiently early, I bolie^'c there is little liability to relapse. I am acquainted with several cases in which from six to ten years have elapsed from the date of the operation, vdthout a sign of a ten- dency to reciuTence of the disease. Paget refers to a case in Avhich thirty years elapsed after the removal of a scrotal cancer before the reappearance of the disease. But great risk of recurrence arises from the delay of operation and the employment of inefficient means. The operation may be successfully prac- tised at almost any age. I ha^n removed an epithelioma of the tongue from ti man 85 years of age Avith perfect success. Excision should always be preferred whenever practicable, and should be done as soon as the nature of the disease is recognised, the part being thoroughly removed together Avith a Avide margin of tissue on each side of and beneath it, so that no germs may be left from Avhich new growths may spring. When the neighboiu’ing lymphatic glands are but slightly enlarged, the operation may still be done ; the glandular enlargement, which may be dependent on iiTita- tion, gradually subsiding. If, however, the enlargement be more considerable the affected gland must be extirpated ; but if there be a chain of eidarged glands, more especially in the deeper caAities, no operation should be under- taken, as the disease Avill then have become constitutional. If the disease be situated on one of the extremities, as the hand or foot, partial or complete amputation may be the safest procedure ; and such cases are less hable to relapse than others in which such free extu'pation is not admissible. The Ligature may be advantageously employed Avhen the cancer is so situated that excision is impracticable, either on account of dangerous haemorrhage, or fr-om the impossibility of effectually extirpating the disease. The part having- been AveU insulated, and effectually strangled by stout whip-cord hgatures, sloughs and separates in a few days. By means of the Eeraseur (Fig. 318), cancroid and other groAvths of consider- Fig. 313.—Cliassaignac’s Steel Cliaiii Ecraseur.TREATMENT BY CAUSTICS. Sis •md then having applied the loop of the chain round its base, to tighten this and effect the’ strangulation by Avorking the handle every ten or hfteen seconds, untd the mass is detached. The resulting wound is small and puckered m, and often lieals with but little trouble. If the mass to be removed be large, two or more (icrascurs may be used at the same time, the chains having been passed through the tissues by means of a needle. The action of the ecraseur differs according to the kind of instrument used. Chassaignac’s original ecraseur, armed with a steel chain, and having a to-and-fro movement, acts like a saw. That which Fig. 314.—Ecraseur applied. is now often employed (vide vol. ii.. Diseases of the Tongue) acts as a simple constrictor ; and its use is therefore less likely to be followed by hmmonhage. This instrument appears to me to be chiefly apphcable to cases in which, as in cancroid ulcer of the tongue, excision is hazardous on account of the haemorrhage attending it, while the hgature is objectionable onaccomit of the foetor and dis- charge resulting from the slow separation of the constricted mass, which sloughs and becomes putrescent. The French Singeons, however, extend the use of the ecrasem’ to many cases in vhich in this country the ligature or the knife is prefeiTed. They suppose that pyaemia is less likely to follow removal by this instrument than by the more ordinary means, purulent absorption less readily occurring while the vessels on the cut sinface are crushed together. Whether this be really so, remains to be proved. Caustics.—In some instances, the disease being so situated, as in some parts •of the face, or in the deeper camties of the body, that it cannot be dissected out, the application of caustics will be useful in procming its removal; but, if these agents be employed, care should be taken that they be freely applied and be sufliciently strong, so as thoroughly to destroy the whole of the morbid textines. Inefficient caustics, such as nitrate of silver, initate and do not destroy the tissues to which they are applied, and in this way do much mischief. Inflam- mation is excited around the cancroid growths, plastic exudation takes place, and this becomes rapidly infiltrated by the abnormal structure, which thus extends with much greater rapidity than would otherwise have been the case. The best caustic preparations are the concentrated sulphinic acid, arsenic, and chloride of zinc paste, fused potassa cum calce, the potassa fusa, the Vienna paste, and the acid nitrate of mercury (vide p. 802). All of these may be applied successfully, though they should not be used indiscriminately. The chloride of zinc and the Viemia paste are most useful when the ulcerated8i6 TUMOURS. surface is large, and indurated at its base or edge. The acid nitrate of mercury should only be employed when the sore is small, supei-ficial, in-egular, and without much induration. In such cases also, the arsenical pastes and powders already described are very useful. AYhen a recurrence takes place after operation for epithelioma, it is either by a fresh deposit of cancerous matter in the cicatrix, or else by the neighbouring lymphatic glands which had been contaminated before the operation, continuing to enlarge and at last ulcerating, and thus destroying the patient by cachexy and exhaustion, but (except in very rare cases) without the occiu-rence of secondary deposits in internal organs. Recurrence.—Epithelioma, when it recurs after removal by operation, may do so in three different ways. 1. By Local Reproduction.—This is the most ordinary mode ofrecuiTence— the disease appearing again after a time in the cicatrix, or in neighbom-ing lymphatic glands which are on a bne with the cicatrix, whether reproduction have taken place in it or not. In this mode of recinTence it is probable that epitheliomatous. cells had either been disseminated more widely than was suj)posed in tissues that appeared healthy, and thus developed anew in the lips of the wound after cicatrisation, or that they had previously been deposited in the lymphatic glands and there had developed afresh. When reproduction of the disease takes place in this local manner, it is usually rapid within a few weeks, or at most, months, of the operation, and death is speedy from haemor- rhage, blood-contamination, and exhaustion. 2. By Nciylibouring hut not Local Reproduction.—would appear as if in some cases there was a tendency to epitheliomatous disease in a particular region of the body, Avhich becomes more or less widely affected in different parts in a consecutive manner. Thus I have seen after the removal of an epithelioma of the lip on one side, recurrence of the disease inside the mouth on the other side ; or after the removal of an epithehoma on one side of the face, retinn of the disease in the cervical lymphatic glands on the opposite side. This method of recm-rence is slower than the fii-st. I have seen fr-om three to four years elapse between the removal of the epithehoma on the left side of the lower lip and its recurrence inside the right cheek. 3. By Distant Recurrence either on the surface of the body or in internal organs. This distant recinrence is not, in my experience, so common as the other methods. But I have seen, after removal of an epitheliomatous tongue, recurrence in one of the toes, and in the lung, after a lapse of neaily two years ; and also deposits in internal organs as recurrences after removal of superficial epithelioma. Adenoid Cancer. Columnar Epithelioma.—This form of cancer bears the same relation to the papilloma of the intestine that the squamous epithe- lioma does to a common wart or corn on the skin. It is confined to those reo-ions which are naturally covered by columnar epithelium. It may come under the care of the Siu-geon in the rectimi, or, by causing obstruction of the sigmoid flexiu’o or colon, it may call for the operation of colotomy. 1 le tumour has a somewhat firm fleshy base, and is usuaUy papillary on its surface. A section of such a growth (Fig. 315) shows it to be composed of tubes lined with columnar epithelium, bound together by a delicate connective tissue,EXCISION OF TUMOURS. ^*7 more or loss infiltrated with small round colls. The tubes resemble gigantic ciypts of Lieborkiihn. By the microscope alone it is not always easy to dis- ’Fi" 315—Colunmar Epitlielioiua of transverse Colon (18S cliam.). One tube is cut obliquely, the others “hransvei^” tte epithelium is irregular in shape and size, and is sometimes arranged in more than one layer. The stroma is fibrous, containing small round ceUs. tinguish these tumours from simple papillomata covered with columnar epithe- lium, in which the bases of the papiUie on section give the appearance of tubes. The in-egularity of the structure and the gTeater cell-infiltration of the con- mective tissue would lead to a suspicion of malignancy. These tumom’S give rise to secondary growths in the glands, and sometimes •even in the hver, in both of which situations they maintain their characteristic features, so that a tissue, looking like crypts of Lieberkiihn irregularly massed together, may be found in the lymphatic glands or in the hver. In the lymphatic glands of the groin these tumours may break down and ulcerate, as in the case of common epithelioma. Except in the rectum, the diagnosis of this cancer is impossible on aecount of its seat, and it seldom occms in such a situation as to admit of any treatment. EXCISION OP TUMOUBS. In describing the different forms of encysted tumoiu’, the operative procedimes necessary for their removal have been adverted to. We may now conveniently consider the steps that are generally necessary for the extirpation by the knife of solid tumom’S from the soft parts. In the removal of tumours, the ftrst point to be attended to is the arrange- ment, shape, and direction of the necessary incisions. These should not only have reference to the size of the gTowth, extending well beyond it at each end, but must also be planned with due regard to subjacent parts of importance. As a general rule, they should be carried in the direction of the axis of the limb or part, and parallel to the course of its principal vessels ; they must not only extend over the whole length of the tumour, but also a little beyond it at each end ; no cross-cuts should be made, if they can be avoided, and this may usually be done by attention to the proper position and extension of the linear incisions. In most cases, no skin should be removed, a simple cut being made ; but if the intcgumeiital tissues be either very abundant and loose, or elseTUMOURS. 8iS adherent, an elliptical portion of them may be excised together Avith the tinnonr. In other instances, again, a semilunar flap of integument may Avith advantage he turned up from the tumour, the surface of Avdiich is then fairly exjAosed ; this, hoAvever, can only be done in some simple tumours, such as fatty gTOAvths. The flaps covering the groAvth should then be freely but cautiously dissected back, so as to expose its sides and base ; as these are approached, and the Surgeon reaches the neighbourhood of its more important and deeper connections, increased care AAdll be necessaiy, as it not unfrequently happens that the tumour is in more important relations Avith deep-seated blood-vessels and nerves of a large size than Avould at first appear. When practicable, the chej) dissection Avill best be commenced and cam'ed out from that part of the base of the tumour into Avhich the principal blood- vessels appear to enter ; they arc thus early cut, and being once ligatured give no ftu’ther trouble, Avhich they Avould do Avere they divided from the direction of their branches toAvards the trunk, Avhen at each successiA’e stroke of the knife a fresh portion of the vessel Avould be touched. In carrying on this deep dissection, the operator should proceed methodically from one side of the tumour to the other, the assistants holding aside the skin so as to give as much room as possible, AA^hilst the Surgeon himself, seizing the mass Aidth his left hand, or Avith a large double hook or vulsellum, and dragging it AA^ell forivards, uses the knife by successive strokes, but in a leisurely and careful mamier, avoiding all undue haste, until he completely detaches it from its connections. The safety of contiguous important structures Ai'ill be best secured by keeping the edge of the knife constantly directed toAvards the tumour, if this be non-malignant ; by attention to this rule, I hax'e seen Liston remove tumours Avith remarkable facility and ease from the neighboiu’hood of most important parts. If, hoAvever, the groAvth be malignant, the incisions must be made Avide of the disease into the healthy structures around ; unless this be done, portions of the tumour may be left from Avhich fresh groAvths Ainll rapidly sprout, or cancer-ceUs may impregnate the neighbom-ing tissues through Avhich they are scattered, and may eventually become so many fresh centres of malignant action. After the tumoiu has been removed, it must be carefully examined, Avith the AueAV of ascer- taining Avhether it be entire ; and, if any portions have been left, these must be properly dissected out. In some situations, as the axilla, the side of the neck, or the groin, Avhere the relations are of great importance, the less the edge of the knife is used the better, and the groAvth should be enucleated by the Surgeon’s fingers or by the handle of the scalpel. The Surgeon should rarely undertake the removal of tumoins that cannot bo Avholly and entirely extirpated, as the part left Avill alivays groAv Avith gx’eatly increased rapidity, often assuming a fungous character ; this is especially the case AA’ith malignant tumoins, the rapidity of increase of AALich is greatly aug- mented by partial ojierations. The exception to this rule consists in the case in Avhich a large ulcerating and necrosing mass may be removed AAuth the viOAv of giving the patient temporary ease, and saving him from the annoyance of the putrescence of a disintegrating tumour. Should, hoAVOver, the Surgeon have begun the oiieration Avith the inten- tion of removing the Aidiole, and have been deceiA’ed as to [the depth and connections of the mass, if, for instance, he find, after commencing hisTHE ELASTIC LIGATURE. 819 operation, that the tumour extends more deeply than had been anticipated and comes into such close relation with important vessels, as at the summit of the axilla or in the perimeum, as to prevent him from dissecting it out without imminent risk of destroying the patient, the only alter- native left is one that I have seen Liston adopt, and have had occasion myself to practise ; viz., to throw a strong whip-cord ligature, above the apex of the ^-owth as high up as practicable, and then to cut off everything below this. On the separation of the ligature, any portion of the tumour that has been included will be brought away as if it had been removed by the knife. In some cases it will be found, after dividing the fascia covering the tumour, that the attachments of the growth are not so firm or deep as had been pre- viously expected ; this is especially the case in some large tumours springing from the side of the neck and the parotid region, or in the gToin. The growth may then often be removed in a great measure by separating the areolar tissue with the handle of the knife, merely dividhig those portions of the deeper attachments that are peculiarly dense. The wound that is left after the removal of a tumour usually unites, partly by adhesive inflammation, and partly by the second intention ; it should be lightly dressed, the edges being brought together by stiips of plaster and covered by water-di’essing, and if large, supported by a compress and bandage. If the cavity left be very deep, great advantage wiU be derived from the use of di’ainage tubes, to prevent the accumulation of the discharges. Sutures should not be employed unless absolutely necessary ; they irritate, and their removal is very painful. The clasiic ligature has of late years been employed for the strangulation of tumoius. It is possible that such a means may be useful in certain small pedunculated growths, which dry on being strangled ; but its application to large tumours, as of the breast, is simply a revival of medimval bai’barism with the aid of modem appliances. The slowness of its action, the pain as it ents through, the large wound that is left, the foetor from the necrosed tumoiu, and the chance of septic infection from this cause, aU tend to make it a method that should be avoided whenever the knife can be employed. Far more tedious, and certainly not safer than the knife, it is also inferior to caustics, which at aU events arrest putrefaction, and many of which, as chloride of zinc, have a powerful antiseptic action. 3 0 2820 SCROFULA AND TUBERCLE. CHAPTER XXXV. —i— SCEOFULA AND TUBERCLE. These two diseases are intimately connected Avitli certain morbid states of tbe lymphatic system, and have by many writers been considered merely as different expressions of the same constitutional state ; they may, however, Avith greater propriety, be viewed as the results of a departm'e in different dmections from the normal nutrition of the same system of elementary tissues. The two conditions are undoubtedly closely related in their causes and their effects, and may even co-exist in the same individual; still, in their most typical forms they present very marked differences, which serve to distinguish them clinically as well as pathologically. Scrofula.—By this term is meant a peculiar constitutional condition, either hereditary or acquired, that gives rise to chronic inflammatory changes in certain tissues or organs, often accompanied by more or less swelhng of the proximate lymphatic glands. The affections to which an in- dividual so constituted is most subject, are catarrhal inflammations of the skin and mucous membranes, and subacute inflammations of the periosteal and synovial structures. The products of these inflammatory changes often undergo degeneration and obsolescence, giving rise to cheesy masses, which are not imfr-equently confounded with those derived from true tubercle. The constitutional condition that tends to this is sufficiently characteristic ; but, although we may recognise its existence, and speak of the individual possess- ing such a constitution as having a scrofrflous tendency or diathesis, he can scarcely be considered to labour imder the frflly formed disease mfless some of the above-mentioned changes have taken place in some of his tissues or organs. _ . . Scrofulous Diathesis.—This is a peculiar constitutional state that is often erroneously confounded Avith general debflity. It may, and often does, co-exist Avith this, but is by no means synonymous Avith weakness of con- stitution. Debility often exists Avithout any scrofulous tendency or taint, more particularly in individuals of the nervous temperament; many dehcate people, though weak, being perfectly healthy, and shoAving no disposflion to this peculiar affection; on the contrary, the scrofulous constitution is often conjoined Avith much muscular poAver and mental activity. Biit though no Aveakness may be manifested in either of these respects, scrofrila is invariably conjoined with debility or perversion of the iiutritiA-e activity of the boj'. This is especially manifested in certain tissues, such_ as the mucoiis and tiic cutaneous ; and in those organs, the vitality of Avhich is low, as t e ymp la ic glands, the bones, and the joints. In these, scrofrila is espcciaUy apt toSCROFULOUS TEMPERAMENT. 821 influence the products of nutrition and of inflammation, more particularly during the early periods of life, when these actions arc most energetic, 111 such a way as to render its existence evident to the Surgeon. It is this tendency to the occun-ence of particular diseases, and to the engi’afting of special characters on atiections of certain tissues, that may be considered as specially indicative of the existence of the scrofulous diathesis ; the existence of which is, more- over, marked by the presence of a peculiar temperament. The Scrofulous Temperament assumes two distinct forms, the fair and the dark, and each of these presents two varieties, the fine and the coarse. The most common is that which occurs in persons with fliir, soft, and trans- parent skin, having clear blue eyes Avith large pupils, light hair, tapering fingei-s, and fine Avhite teeth ; indeed, whose beauty is often great, especially in eaidy life, being dependent rather on roundness of outline than on grace of form ; and Avhose groAvth is rapid and precocious. In these individuals the atiections arc strong, and the procreative power considerable ; the mental actiAuty is also great, and is usually characterised by much delicacy and soft- ness of feeling, and Auvacity of intellect. Indeed, it would appear in such pemons as these, that the nutritive, procreative, and mental poAvers are rapidly and energetically developed in early life, but become proportionately early exhausted. In another variety of the fair scrofulous temperament, we find a coarse skin, short and roimdecl featimes, light grey eyes, crisp and curhng sandy hair, a short and somewhat ungainly statime, and clubbed fingers ; but not un- commonly, as in the former variety, great and early mental activity, and occasionally much muscular strength. In the dark form of the scrofulous temperament, we usually find a somewhat heavy, sullen, and forbidding appearance ; a dark, coarse, sallow, or greasy- looking skin ; short, thick, and harsh ciuly hair ; a small stature, but often a powerful and strong-limbed frame, A\dth a certain degree of torpor or languor of the mental faculties, though the powers of the intellect are sometimes re- markably developed. The other dark strumous temperament is characterised by clear dark eyes, fine hair, a salloAv skin, and by mental and physical organisation that closely resembles the first described variety of the fair strumous diathesis. In all these varieties of temperament, the digestive organs will be found to be Aveak and inntable. This condition, which I believe to be invariably asso- ciated Avith struma, and the importance of which has been pointed out by Sir James Clark, must be regarded as one of the most essential conditions con- nected Avdth scrofula, and as tending greatly to that impairment of nutrition Avhich is so frccpient in this state. This gastric irritability is especially characterised by the tongue, even in young children, being habitually coated toAvards the root Avith a thick AA^hite fur,, through which elongated papillm pro- ject, constituting the “ pipped ” or “ strawbeny ” tongue ; the edges and tip, as Avell as the lips, being usually of a bright red colour. This state of the tongue is aggi-avated by stimulants, high living, and the habitual use of pur- gatives. In the fair varieties the boAvels are usually someAvhat loose, but in the dark foims of struma there is a torpid condition of the intestinal canal. In all cases the action of the heart is feeble, the blood is thin and Avatery, and there is a tendency to coldness, and often to clamminess of the extremities.822 SCEOFULA AND TUBERCLE. Strumous Inflammation,—One of tlic most marked cliaraeteristies of struma is certainly tlie peculiar modification that inflammation undergoes, whether we regard the course that it takes, the form that it assumes, its pro- ducts, or its seat. The course of inflammation in strumous subjects is always slow, feeble, and ill-developed, the more active and sthenic conditions being rarely met with. In its form it is usually congestive, ulcerative, or suppura- tive; and in products it is characterised by little tendency to adhesion, by the production of thin, blue, Aveak, and ill-developed cicatrices, and by the formation of thin, curdy pus, Avith much shreddy corpuscular lymph. The seat of strumous inflammation varies greatly ; and peculiar modifications of coiuse, form, and products are assumed, according to the part that it aftects. The tissues implicated by it are cMefly the skin and mucous membranes, the joints, and the bones, occasioning a great variety of special diseases, according as one or other of these structm’es are affected. It is as the result of, or in connection with these local affections, that the general symptoms of struma become most marked. Whatever the A'ariety of temperament may be, the individual usually emaciates, becomes sallow, cachectic, and debilitated, and at length falls into hectic or marasmus. When affecting the SMn, scrofula declares itself under a variety of cutaneous eruptions, especially the different forms of eczema of the scalp, and various ulcers on the siuface, usually Aveak, and largely granulating, with considerable swelling of the siurounding parts, and a tendency to the formation of thin blue and glazed cicatrices (Fig. 316). The integuments of the AA^hole of the limb may become so much diseased in this way, oedematous, infiltrated, and covered by flabby ulcers and fistulm, the extremity being perhaps double its natural size, that amputation is the sole resource. ^ The Mucous Membranes are commonly extensively affected, and often pre- sent the earlier forms of scrofulous disease in childhood ; this is more especially the cascAAdth those of the eyelids and nose. The conjunctiva becomes chronic- ally inflamed, perhaps Avith ulceration of the cornea. The mucous membraneCHARACTERS OF TUBERCLE. of the eyelids may be permanently congested and irritated, with loss of lashes, Instituting the dilfeient forms of psorophthahnia. The mucous membrane liiiiiar the nostrils becomes cln-onically congested, red, and siiollen, to hid)itual snilHng of the nose, and to a sensation as of a constant cold. Ucca- sionally that lining the antrum becomes irritated, and may then occasion an cnlaro-ement of this cavity, or the discharge of unhealthy pus into the nostri s. The tonsils are often found chronically enlarged and indurated, with occasional tendency to fresh inflammation ; and the larynx may become the seat ot various forms of congestion of its lining membrane, giving rise to aphonia The state of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane has already been described when speaking of the state of the tongue ; and that of the genito-m-inary or«-ans is also marked by a tendency to debility and irritation, indicated by discharges from the lu-cthra induced by very slight exciting causes, and often ■\-ery permanent. The occurrence of calculus of the bladder, especially in children, may also occasionally be attributed to the scrofulous diathesis. Perhaps the most important local diseases arising under the influence of tliis agency, arc those of the Bones and Joints. The bones are liable to the occur- rence of vaiious forms of caries and necrosis (Fig. 317) ; more especially those bones that are spongy in their texture, as the short bones of the foot, and the articiflar ends of long bones. The joints are liable to that large class of affec- tions that are commonly included under the term of white sivelhnc), which consists of thickening, disorganisation, ulceration, and suppiuation of the synovial membranes and cartilages. Lastly, some of the Glandular Organs are pecidiai-ly prone to scrofulous disease. Enlargement of the lymphatic glands, more particularly by the side of the neck and under the angles of the jaw, is of such frequent occurrence, and is usually so early a sign, that the Surgeon, in determining whether an individual is scrofulous or not, commonly passes his hand over the glands in this situation in order to ascertain their condition and size ; these glandular enlargements are especially apt to rmi into unhealthy and chronic suppuration. The testes and the mammte are occasionally afiected ; hut other glandular structures, though sometimes implicated, are by no means so cominoidy found diseased as those that have just been mentioned. Tubercle.—The occmrence of tubercle indicates a far greater departure from the normal nutrition of the part than is required for the production of scrofula. The typical constitutional temperament is that described at page 321 as the first scrofulous variety, but every degree will be found to exist between this and the coarser form. Tubercle more frequently affects the serous membranes and the internal organs, especially the areolar tissue entering into their structmu, than scrofula does ; whilst the skin and mucous memlu’anes, which are commonly attacked by the latter, are rarely primarily invaded by the former. Tubercle, though sufficiently well marked by its appearances and progress, cannot be looked upon as a specific affection, but must be considered to be a perverted or unhealthy development of the nutritive materials destined for the repair of the body and the restoration of the blood. According to Simon, it consists of a disease of the lymph, or nascent blood. It is a “ dead concre- tion,” a fibriniform product; insusceptible of development. “ The scrofulous824 SCEOFULA AND TUBERCLE. diathesis, says Simon, “ consists in a peculiarity of Idood-dcTelopment, under A\ Inch the nascent blood tends to molecular death by superoxydation.” Accoiding to C. J. B, Williams, “Tubercle is a degraded condition of the iiutritive material from Ajdaich the old textures are renewed, and the new ones formed ; and it differs from fibrine or coagulable lymph not in kind, but in degree of vitahty and capacity of organisation.” It must, however, be ■\dewed in the light of a new formation derived fr-om the lymphatic elements of the connective tissue (Fig. 318); and it exhibits a Pig. 31S.—Diagram from Virchow, of Development of Tuhcrcle from connective Tissue in the Pleura, showing Transition from Corpuscles of that Tissue up to the producti6n of Tuhercie Granules. Tlie cells in the micUlle are undergoing fatty degeneration. 300 Diameters. constant tendency to affect the lymphatic system in every organ which it invades. It is essentially a lowly organised formation, tending rapidly to dis- integration and dissolntion. Recent experiments have conffimed the opinion formerly held, that it has not a specific origin : it may be produced in the lower animals by the introduction beneath the skin of irritating or putrid animal substances, and it will very readily reproduce itself, both locally and in internal organs, when transferred fr-om one animal to another. Stmeture.—Tubercle essentially ocem-s in two forms. It is met with as semi- transparent grey granulations, smooth, and cartilaginous in look, somewhat hard, closely adherent, and accumulated in groups, often with a good deal of i inflammatory action in the siuToimding tissues. These -gTey gTannlations, j', usually about the size of a small pin’s head, appear to consist of modified j, exndation-matter. They have a tendency to run into masses, and to form the , J true yellow tubercle, w^hich is met with in opaque, firm, but friable concretions / of a dull whitish, or yellowish colom-, homogeneous in strnctin-e, and without j any appearance of vascularity. The microscopic characters of tubercle present no very specific appearances. The grey granulations or mihaiy tubercle consist mainly of a fii-m, reticulate stroma, in Avhich are imbedded a number of cells and nuclei. These cells present two principal varieties, which measure respectively y-l of an inch in diameter : the larger ones contain two or three nuclei, which ' may sometimes be seen in the act of dividing; the smaller ones contain only a single nucleus. Many free nuclei, oval or spindle-shaped, also exist. In the condition called crude yellow tubercle, multiple cells may be found at the circumference of the mass, whilst single nucleated cells occupy the centre : free nuclei are scattered abundantly amongst the cells.

In the softer forms of yel oi, tulicrcle the ceUs are more disintcgi-ated, and drops of molecular oil and much oranular matter arc present. The fluid parts may subsequently become absorbed, and leave a cheesy or cretaceous mass. Tubercle must often be recoo-nised rather by its negative than by its positive characters—by ascei- tainhi^r ivhat it is not, and so, by a process of exclusion, amving at its true nature! It is most easily confounded with pus, from which, however, it may be distinguished by its possessing a solid intercellular substance. The Frocjress of tubercle is most commonly to disintegration and liquefac- tion at the same time that it gives rise, by its initation, to inflammation and suppuration in the siuTounding tissues ; hence it commonly leads to abscesses, the pus of which is always curdy and shreddy. In some cases tubercle may become indurated, and undergo a species of calcification. Causes.—The causes of scrofula and tubercle, uidess these be of a hereditary character, though very various in their natime, are usually such conditions as influence injuriously the nutrition of the body. The Hereditary Nature of both scrofula and tubercle is well known to the pubhc and to the profession ; for, although the disease is not commonly connate, yet the tendency to it is, and the characteristic natime of the affection often manifests itself at an early period, notAvithstanding every effort to prevent its development. That a parent may transmit a tendency to malnutrition, to misdevelopment of the blood, just as he may a peculiar feature or mental condition, is imdoubted. It is by the hereditary transmission of peculiar combinations and modifications of action in the organisation that hereditary diseases develop themselves at certain periods in the life of the offspring when the injurious results of the morbid actions that have been transmitted have had time to be produced. There are certain conditions which, though not scrofulous, are supposed to have a tendency to develop this disease in the offspring to which they are transmitted; thus very dyspeptic parents com- monly have strumous children ; so, also, the offspring of very old or very young people often 'exhibit a proneness to scrofnlous or tuberculous affections. The infinence of intermarriage is stiU a matter of doubt, but I believe that it is but small; and it is commonly stated that the inhabitants of small commu- nities who intennarry closely, such as those of the Isles of Portland and of Man, are not more liable to scrofula than other individuals. The most poAverfnl occasioning cause of scrofula, and that which in most civilised countries is likewise the most frequent, i^maJoiuirition and malassimi- lat'ion arising from an habitual disregard of hygienic laws ; either from want of food, or the administration of improper food, in the poorer classes ; or from overfeeding, and overstimiTlation of the digestive organs, amongst the children of the wealthier orders of society, inducing chronic irritation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and interference with the digestive powers, and con- sequently with nuti-ition. The influence of food that is innutritions in quality or insufficient in quantity, has been shown by Phillips, in his excellent Treatise on^ Scrofula, to be the most immediate cause of this disease ; and, when con- joined with the injurious effects of a confined and impure atmosphere, it may826 SCliOFULA AND TUBERCLE. bo considcrGcl as sufficient to occasion tlic disease in those cases in which no piedisposition to it exists, and greatly to de^•elop any hereditary tendency to it in the system. It is to the conjoined influence of agencies such as these, that we must attribute the prevalence of scrofula amongst the lower orders both of to^^m and of rural populations. ihe moculaUlUy, m.fecUon^ and transmission of tubercle are cpiestions of the deepest interest in a pathological point of view. Their fuU consideration would lead far beyond the limits of such a w-ork as this. It is sufficient to say that the experiments of ViUermin, Wilson Fox, and Burdon Sanderson have fully established the inoculability of tubercle. The infection of the system from old caseous tuberculous deposits, more especially in bones, if not actually proved, is in the highest degree probable. And there is strong evidence in support of the belief of its transmission from individual to indfr ■S'idual by close cohabitation, social or sexual. The practical bearings of these pathological facts and views arc obvious in their application to the hygienic prevention of tuberculosis, and the import- ance of the removal by operation of all old tuberculous masses in glands or bones, lest they become centres of tuberculous dissemination. Both scrofulous and tuberculous manifestations are often called into im- mediate action by the chMUtij mcluced hy previous diseases, such as measles, scarlatina, hooping-cough, &c., which lead to an overaction of the lymphatic system, resulting in an active hyperplasia of the gland elements. The former usually develops itself at an early age, though seldom before the child has reached its second year. It is most commonly about the period of the second dentition that the affection declares itself, and it is rare to meet with it for the first time after the ages of tw^enty-five or thirty-five. According to Phillips, when it is fatal, it usually proves so before the fifteenth year ; GO to 70 per cent, of the deaths occurring before this age. Sex does not appear materially to influence the disease ; though, according to the same authority, the deaths of males from scrofula exceed those of females, in this country, by 21 per cent. These numbers may, howover, requho correction if we are to regard phthisis as an affection dependent upon the existence of either of these condi- tions, people who are scrofulous in early life often becoming the subjects of that form of phthisis now called scrofulous pneumonia. Treatment.—This should rather consist in endeavouring to prevent the occinrence or full manifestation of scrofula, than in removing it Avhen it is actually existing. Indeed, the Preventive Treatment is perhaps of most consequence, and by j>roper attention to it, I have no hesitation in saying, the development of the affection, even when hereditary, may be stopped ; and the child of strumous parents, presenting perhaps the featines indicative of the diathesis, may pass through fife without the disease having an opportmiity of declaring itself. In order to accomplish this, how^ever, the preventive plan of treatment must be commenced early, and continued uninteiTuptedly for a considerable time, even for years. The preventive treatment of scrofrda and tubercle may be said in pneral terms to consist in close and continuous attention to hygienic rules. Ihe diet must be specially attended to ; nourishing food, but of the lightest quality, being given. A great error is often committed in overloading the stomach.827 CURATIVE TREATMENT. M-ith more or with heavier food than ifc can digest, under the impression that stron<>- food is necessary to give the patient strength. In consequence of this eiTor'thc irritability of the mucous membrane is kept up, nuU-ition is impel- fectly and badly performed, the surplus food is thrown olf 111 the shape 0 lithates or other products of iiialassimilation, and health and strength, uhich are the results of perfect nutrition, become impaired rather than impiw eel. d'he use of stimulants, whether wine or beer, should be very sparing, and the milder and weaker should bo prefeii-ed to the heavier and stronger kinds ot malt liquor; the bowels must be kept regular with the simplest aperients; the clothing should be warm, and must cover the whole of the surface ; and t ie patient should, if possible, be kept in well-ventilated rooms. He should be allowed sufficient exercise in the open air, not carried to the imint ot latigue, and should, if his circumstances will permit, have change of air from time to time, alternating a sea with an inland climate. Bathing also, whether in sea or river, with the habitual use of the tepid or cold sponge-bath, and fr'iction ot the surface vith horse-hair gloves or a rough towel, so as to keep the skin in healthy action and its cutaneous ch’ciilation free, should be regularly practised. In carrying out this general plan of treatment, it must be borne in mind that the health and strength of a delicate and weakly child can only be imjiroved up to the highest standard admissible by its individual constitu- tion. A weakly scrofulous child may be improved in health and may be strengthened in body; but it can never, by any hygienic, dietetic, or medi- cinal process, have the original defect in its organisation so completely eradicated as to be rendered robust and vigorous, as would be a child of good congenital stamina who had been equally well cared for. The Curative Treatment should be specially directed, like the preventive. to the general improvement of the nutrition, and through it to the augmenta- tion of the constitutional vigonr of the patient ; all those hygienic means that have just been alluded to being continuonsly carried out. The more strictly medical treatment of scrofula consists in the administration of tonics and alteratives with the view of improving the patient’s constitutional powers. Before they are administered, however, it is always necessary to see that the digestive organs are in a healthy condition. Scrofula is a consequence of mahiutrition ; and unless we see that digestion, the first stage of the nutri- tive process, is properly accomplished, all other means will be useless. When the tongue is covered noth a white, thick, creamy fin, and has elongated papillas and red edges, the mucous membrane being in a state partly of irritabihty and partly of debility, neither purgatives nor tonics can be largely administered : the former irritating, the latter overstimulating the morbidly sensitive mucons membrane. In these circumstances the patient should be confined to the mildest possible diet, which must principally consist of milk, boiled fish, Avhite meats, and light pudding, no stimulant of any kind being alloAved except a small quantity of claret or bitter beer; and, unless the patient have been accustomed to the use of stimulants, these even had better be dispensed with. Small doses of merciny with chalk, of soda and rhubarb, should be occasionally administered at bed-time, with some of the compound decoction of aloes on the following morning; and a few grains of the carbonate of soda or of potash may be given twice or thrice a day in some light bitter infusion, as of cascarillaSCROFULA AND TUBERCLE. 828 . or calnmba. In many cases of strumous disease, more especially those alfectino- the joints and bones, the liver 'will be found to be enlarged and sluggish in its action, the patient every no’w^ and then becoming bilious, sallo-iv, and'jaundiced ; in these circumstances, small doses of blue pill, carried off with the comj)ound decoction of aloes or a rhubarb draught, will be found necessary from time to time. ^ When all gastric irritation has been rcmo^'cd in this way, or if it have not existed in the usual marked degree from the first, the patient being pale and fiabby, Avith a weakened condition of the pulse, of the skin, and of the mucous surface, then tonics may be administered, and the more specific treat- ment adopted. The gTeat remedies which are employed Avith the A'ieAV of removing scrofula and ciu’ing the secondaiy affections AA^hich it induces, are iron, iodine, the pre- parations of potash, and cod-liA’cr oil. These are all extremely useful, either singly or conjoined, as they serve to carry out distinct indications in the management of this affection. Iron is most useful in improA'ing the nutrition of pale flabby ana3mic sub- jects, increasing markedly the quantity and quality of blood in the system. The best preparations for children are, I think, the vinum fern and the syrup of the iodide of iron. In older persons the tincture of the perchloride, and some of the fonns of the citrate or the phosphate of iron, appear to be most seniceable ; in other cases, again, the natural chalybeate Avaters Avill be found to agree best. Iodine is especially valuable in promoting the absorption of effused plastic matters, and in lessening the morbid hyj)ertrophies Avhich so commonly take place in scrofula. The preparation nsually employed is the iodide of potassium. In order that this may produce its full effects, it should be given as freely as the patient will bear it, continued for a considerable length of time, and espe- cially administered in combinations with other preparations of potash. With the view of preventing it from in-itating the stomach, it should be given in a considerable quantity of some bland fluid. Its combination Avith the other salts renders it more efticacious in removing strumous enlargements and deposits of aplastic and tubercidous matter. For this pinpose I have fonnd the foUoAving form extremely usefid for adults, the dose being proportionately diminished in the case of children :—R Potassii iodidi, Potassse chloratis, aa 5]; PotassaA bicarbonatis, 5iij- Divide into tAvelve powders, of which one is to be taken night and moniing in half a pint of warm milk. In other cases, the liquor j)otassa3, Brandish’s alkaline solution, or lime-Avater given fr’eely in milk, are serAuceable ; bnt I prefer the above prescription. Cod-liver oil, Avhich may be looked upon rather as an article of diet than as a medicine, is of essential utility in improAing the nutrition of the body in cachectic and emaciated states of the system, more particularly in groAA'ing children, or in indiAuduals Avho are suffering from the wasting effects ot strumons suppuration ; it not oidy fattens but strengthens the system, increas- ing decidedly the muscular power and the quantity of red corjAuscles in the blood. It may often very adA^antageonsly be administered in combination a\ ith the iodides of potassium or iron, and giA'en after meals. Of the other tonic remedies AA’hich may be employed in this affection, such as the preparations of larlc and of sarsapardla, I need say nothing beyond that829 OPERATIONS IN SCROFULOUS CASES. o.- iiviv often be usefully administered in fulfilling ordinary therapeutic iiidLations Kinger has lately recommended the sulphide of caUumi as ex- tremely valuable in scrofulous and tuberculous glands, and m chronic strumous sores and abscesses. He uses it in a solution which has much the strength of Harro‘>-ate AVaters. Thus, he directs a gram of the sulphide of calcium to dissolved in a half pint of water, and of this a teaspoonful is taken every hoiu. Under its influence, the glands, it is said, either return to the normal state or hasten on to suppuration, and chronic abscesses either dry up or are speedily broiio-ht forward and their contents discharged, a healthy heahng sore being left The Local Treatment of scrofula consists in a great measure in the ordi- nary local management of chi-onic inflammation, modified according to the seat and peculiar natm-e of the affection. Much of the local treatment, however, especially in the more advanced stages, consists in removing the effects of the disease in the shape of aplastic deposits, false hypertrophies, and general enlargement and thickening of parts. This may usuaUy be done by the appli- cation of lotions containing the iodide of potassium, or the carbonate of potash, apphed by means of lint covered with oiled sdk ; a drachm of each of the salts, with an oimce of spirits of wine to eleven ounces of water, makes an excellent appheation, which appears to dissolve away the fibrinous and plastic deposits common in this disease. In many cases, frictions with the iodide of lead ointment, or pressure by means of strapping and bandages, will be found the most serviceable means that the Singeon can adopt. When matter forms, it should be let out in accordance with the rules laid down in treating of the more chronic forms of abscess. In these cases, the injection of the sac of the abscess vdth a solution of iodine will be foiuid very useful. Operations in Scrofulous and Tuberculous Cases.—In cases of scrofu- lous diseases of the soft parts, the bones, or the joints, the question of the propriety of operating, whether this be for the excision of a gland, the resection of a joint or bone, or the amputation of a limb, has often been discussed. In these cases, operations should not be undertaken too hastily, too early in the disease, or in very young subjects. The affection being constitutional, it will often be found, as the general health of the patient is improved by proper treatment, that local mischief, which at first appeared very intractable, gradually assumes a more circumscribed and healthy form, and, in fact, to a great extent undergoes spontaneous cine by the restoration of the healthy action in the parts. This we especially find to be the case in yoimg children, in whom very extensive disease of the bones and joints may often be recovered from, without the necessity of any serious surgical interference. Should any operation be midertaken, it is desirable not to have recourse to it whilst the disease is actively spreading. In these circumstances, it is not only probable that suppmatire inflammation of an unhealthy kind may be set up in the wound itself^ but that disease of the soft parts or bones may recur in the cicatrix of the original wound, or that the corresponding parts on the opposite side of the body may become similarly affected in very chronic cases of scrofulous disease of bones and joints. After excision of the elbow, the knee, or the bones of the foot and wrist, the morbid action Avill some- times return in the contiguous soft parts to such an extent as to render830 SCROFULA AND TUBERCLE. <i second, operation necessary, althongli the bones n'erc not implicated; tlie tissues in the neighbourhood of the cicatrix becoming swollen, spongy, and infiltrated with a quantity of gelatinous semi-transparent plastic matter, running into unhealthy suppuration, with fistulous tracts leading through it that cannot be brought to heal. In some cases even of simple strumous disease of the integuments of the arm, leg, or foot, attended with gi-cat and in’egnlar deposition of plastic matter, and chronic and intractable ulceration, amputation of the limb is the only course left to the Surgeon. When strumous suppuration leads to hectic, the patient will speedily sink unless the diseased structures be remoYcd.8:, I THE LOCAL CONTAGIOUS ULCER. CPIAPTER XXXVI. VENEREAL DISEASES. The term Venereal Disease is used to denote those affections which arise primarily from sexnal intercourse. It was, until lately, held to include two distinct specific diseases—Syphilis and Gonorrhoea. The special researches of Siu’geons in this country and on the continent hare, however, in late years, apparently established the fact, that in the term Syi^hilis there have been included two distinct affections, both communicable by contagion during inter- coiu’se, hut differing in their characters, and especially in this, that the one is a piu’ely local affection, Avhile the other not only produces local effects, but, by the introduction of a specific poison into the system, infects the general constitution of the person to AYhom it is communicated. To the pm’ely local disease the term Local Contagious Ulcer or Chancre may be applied ; the Avord Syphilis being restricted to the constitutional affection. Hunter and his folloAvers supposed that aU the specific diseases arising fi'om sexual intercourse originated from one and the same poison. But this doctrine has been proved to be eiToneous ; for not only are the local appearances and constitutional effects of these diseases Avidely different, but Ricord has shoAvn, in the most conclusive manner, that gonorrhoeal matter, when in- oculated on the skin or mucous membrane, never produces a chancre ; and that, on the other hand, chancrous pus can never be made to produce gonon-hoea. Each of the diseases—Local Contagious Chancre, Syphilis, and Gonorrhoea— propagates itself, and no other. Tavo of these diseases may, hoAvever, co-exist in the same person. Thus, Av^e shall have occasion to notice the coincidence, in some cases, of the local chancre AAoth the phenomena of constitutional syphilis. Again, Ricord has pointed out, that a Avoman may at the same time be affected by gonoiThoea and by chancres on the uterus ; and this probably explains those cases in Avhich, after connection with the same AVoman, different men haA'e contracted different foims of disease, or even both affections. In this Chapter, Ave shall describe—1, the Local Contagious Ulcer or Chancre ; 2, Syphilis, or Constitutional Syphilis ; rescrAing the consideration of Gonorrhoea till aa'C speak of Diseases of the Urinary Organs. 1. LOCAL CONTAGIOUS ULCER OR CHANCRE. The Local Contagious Ulcer or Chancre is a sore of special form and appearance, characteristic of the nature of the disease. It may oecur on the cutaneous, the muco-cutaneous, and mueous surfaces, most commonly on the latter, on aeeount partly of their greater exposure to contagion, but chiefly from their being less perfectly protected by epidermis. Chancres present much variety as to their appearance and to the course AA'hich they pursue : so gveat indeed5.^2 VENEREAL DISEASES. syphiiis. This chauere, which presents distinctive ohai-acters, wiU he found desenbed at i m,c bl . arc the '^’arietics, that they have been looked upon by some Surgeons as affording ovidei\ce of distinct diseases proceeding from different poisons. This doctrine, however, is entirely erroneous; the varieties in their appearance depend on scat, constitution, and other accidental circiunstances. A chancre, then, is a specific venereal sore or ulcer, originating invariably from contagion, and capable of jn-opagation to other parts of the same or of different individuals by inoculation. Like all other ulcers, a chancre presents two distinct periods : the first, in which it is either spreading or stationary, in which alone it is specific, and which may be of almost indefinite diu’ation ; and the second, in which it has commenced to gvanulate, and a process of repair is set up in it.* Specific Nature.—Ricord has made the important observation that, if the pus from a chancre, diming its first period, be inoculated into any part of the surface of the body, it will invariably produce another specific venereal sore or chancre ; and that no pus that is not chancrous can, under any circumstances, occasion the specific venereal ulcer. This inoculable ulcer is always in its effects a local disease, being confined to a specific sore ; of which the furthest complications are repetition of the sore wherever its discharge invades an un- protected surface, and the occasional irritation of the neighboiu’ing lymphatic glands to inflammation and abscess. OniGiiT AND Progress.—A chancre is necessarily generally contracted in impure sexual intercom’se "with a person afieady contaminated by the disease, by the direct contact of the healthy with a previously diseased sin-face. When a chancre is caught in connection, it usually commences with a small- excoria- tion, which appears to hai^e been directly inoculated mth the specific poison. In other cases, though more rarely, it may be seen at fii'st in the shape of a small pointed pustule, which speedily breaks, leaving an ulcer of a specific character in its site. Very generally, however, this pustule escapes observation, and the disease is presented in the first instance as an ulcer. The chancrous ulcer, whatever form it assumes, seldom makes its appearance until a few days (five or six) after connection. In some cases, however, I have observed it, evidently from the infection of a fissm-e or crack, on the day following impiu-e intercourse ; and occasionally, in rare mstanees, its appearance may be delayed a few days longer than that time which has been mentioned. Chanefes are occasionally contracted in various iiTegular ways. Thus they may occur on the fingers of Surgeons or accoucheiu's from dressing venereal sores, or fr-om attending diseased ivomen dm-ing labour. In these instances, liowever, the consequences of contagion are nearly always of another kind ; namely, the inoculation of constitutional syphilis, not the merely local ulcer. In other cases, the disorder is contracted from the contact of filthy clothes or dirty utensils vdth the person ; and not imcommonly, it is said, chancres are contracted at public water-closets. Although the latter mode of infection is not impossible, it should be received with doubt, as it is an explanation not imcommonly adopted by those who desire to account foi the consequences of an act of immorality, in a ivay that docs not expose them to reproof. , Whatever be the appearances presented by a chancre, there can no longer be * The term Chancre is also applied to the ulcer which is833 SIMPLE OR SOFT CHANCRE. 11101/1.1 111 l^lUlUO 4/V/ V £ .. . 1.1 * 1 .. may ultimately differ, they all present the same characters during their early The prof^ress of a chancre that has been artificially inoculated on any part of the cutaneous surface is as follows, and its study will seiwe to elucidate what takes place in other circumstances. During the first twenty-four hours after the introduction of the specific pus into the skin on the point of a lancet, we find that some inflammation is set up around the puncture, which becomes hot, red, and itchy. About the third or fourth day, a pointed pustule is produced, which is at first deep-set, but becomes on the following day more superficial, with some depression in the centre, resembling rather closely a small-pox pustule ; on close examination, this will be found not to be a true pustule, but rather a mass of epithelial scales and pus not included in a distinct wall. On the fifth day, it has become hard at the base, apparently from the infiltration of plastic matter; and on the sixth it has usually dried, forming a small round scab, and leaving an ulcer which presents the typical characters of a true chancre, being circular and depressed, with a foul greyish surface which cannot be cleansed, sharp-cut edges, a base more or less indurated by inflammation, and an angry-looking red areolar aroimd it. This is the typical chancre, and these are the appearances that every true venereal non-syphilitic sore on the skin will present about the fifth or sixth day after inoculation ; from this time it may diverge more oiTess completely fr’om these characters, but will yet, if inocu- lated at any time during the poisonous stage, produce an ulcer that will run the specific course up to the same period, after which it may in its turn again deviate into one or other of the unusual forms that chancres occasionally assume. Varieties.—These have been described under various denominations by the numerous writers on these affections. The foUeiving classification wiU include them all ;—1, the Simple or Soft Chancre, or Chancrous Excoriation ; 2, the Phagedsenic Chancre; and ?>, the Sloughing Chancre. As H. Lee has observed,, each of these varieties of chancres is associated with a particular variety of inflammatory action. Thus the sofl is the suppnraiive form ; the phagedcomo,. the ulcerative; and tlie sloughing, the gangrenous. The particular form of the sore is in each case determined by its situation, and the constitution of the patient or that of the individual furnishing the contagion. 1. Simple or Soft Chancre, or Chancrous Excoria,tion, is certainly that form of the disease which is most commonly met with in London at present, from its excessively contagious character. It consists of one or more small sores, of a very shallow character, resembling rather an abrasion, Avith shai-p-cut edges, somewhat circular in shape, and having a tawny greyish or yellowish surface, with a naiTOW red areola around the edge : in many cases at- tended with much heat and itching. These sores are usually seated on the cleft under the corona glandis, or about tlie glans, the whole of which may be studded by them. In fact, one peculiarity of this chancre is its tendency to multipli- cation on the contiguous structures. In other cases, the sores invade the^ VOL.

The excoriated chancres not unfrequently present somewhat varying appear- ances. In some cases their surhice becomes covered with large fungous gi-anulations, hence iQvmQfL fang citing sores. In other instances they are truly irritable, becoming exceedingly sensitive, with a tendency to spread, and having a dusky red areola around them. These chancres are very frecpiently attended by much general inflammation of the penis ; the organ being swollen, red, and semi-transparent, from subcutaneous oedema, and usually in a state of phimosis, with much purulent secretion between the prepuce and glans. 2. Phagedaenic Chancre is characterised by a tendency to erosion, with much destruction of the parts that it invades. It may assume the phagedasnic character from the very first, or this maybe set up in one of the other varieties of chancre at some period of their course. The progress of this phagedtenic or eroding chancre is usually somewhat slow, but continuous; it commonly affects the glans, more especially in the neighbourhood of the fr-Eenum or urethra, destroying a considerable portion of the organ in this situation. Wallace has divided this form of chancre into three varieties ; that without slough, that ivith tv Jute slough, and that with Mach slough. Each of these varieties, again, may be of a simple, an inflamed, or an irritahle character. This classification apj)ears to me to be an useful and practical one, and I accordingly adopt it. The phagedaenic chancre ivitJwut slough is a truly eroding ulcer, spreading with sharply cut edges, attended by some slight inflammatory action, and with much activity of progress ; it is commonly observed about the fr’Eenum and imder part of the glans, and very frequently hollows out and destroys the organ in this situation to a considerable extent. In the pJiagedcenic chancre with tvhite slough, we find an irregular eroding ulcer, with a thin margin of white slough situated at the junction of the dead and living structures ; that which covers’ the siuface of the sore having usually become darkened by exposure to air, to dressings, and to secretions. phagedcenic chancre with Mach slough differs but little from the last, except in the colour of the slough, which may be in a great measure accidental, and in its tendency to indiuation, and to somewhat rapid extension ; it must not be confounded Avith the next form of chancre, Avhich presents many points of difference. All these varieties of phagedmnic chancre may be inflamed, being attended with much heat, redness, and swelling, increase of discharge, and rapidity of action ; or they may be irritable, occurring in cachectic individuals, when they are accompanied by much pain, and usually a good deal of consti- tutional isturbance of a nervous and irritative type. 3. Sloughing Chancre, or Gangrenous Phagedsena, is a combmation of rapidly spreading and destructive gangrene Avith the venereal poison, and may be looked upon as a gangrenous inflammation of a venereal sore. The gangrene is usually the consequence of the confinement of the venereal pus under an elongated prepuce, in a person of inflammatory and irritable con- stitution, in Avhom the loose areolar tissue of the genital oi’gans readily takes on sloughing action Avhen inflamed. It usually affects the upper siuface of the prepuce. The parts becoming immensely SAVollen, red, and someAA’hat braA\ ny, and the prepuce being in a state of complete and permanent phimosis, a duskyS35 SITUATIONS OF CHANCRE. l)lack-lookin<? spot soon makes its appearance on one side of the organ ; this rapidly extends, giving rise to thick, black, soft, and pultaceons slongiis, de- stroying perhaps the whole of the prepuce, and exposing and implicating the glans to a great extent, accompanied sometimes by copious luemorrhage from the dorsal artery of the penis on the separation of the sloughs, and by denuda- tion of the corpora cavernosa. In other cases, the prepuce sloughs on one side only ; a round aperture forming in it, through which the glans projects, whilst the swollen and inflamed extremity of the prepuce hangs down behind it, giving the organ a very remarkable, and at first sight, somewhat puzzling iippearancc. After the separation of the sloughs, granulations rapidly spring up, the sore loses its specific character, and cicatrisation advances with rapidity. Situation.—As chancres almost invariably result from connection with pci-sons sulfering from sores of similar nature, they commonly occur on the genital organs. In the male they may be met with in any part of these ; theii characters vary somewhat, howei'cr, according to the situation in which they ocem. They are by far most commonly seated in the angle formed between the glans and the prepuce ; they then appear most frequently at the orifice or on the inner surface of the prepuce, next on the fi’amum, then on the glans, and lastly at the orifice of the urethra, or on the skin of the body of the penis. Those about the frmnum are often sloughy and irritable, have a great tendency to perforate or destroy this membrane, and are more frequently followed by haimorrhage or bubo than any of the other varieties of the disease. The Urethral Chancre is usually situated just within the orifice of the canal, and may be seen on pressing open its bps, in the form of a small sloughy sore, which occasionally creeps out upon the glans. Sometimes it is more deeply seated, so as to be out of sight; when this is the case, a thick, tenacious, sloughy and bloody discharge appears in small quantities from the methra ; at a little distance up the canal there will usually be felt, on grasping the organ between the fingers, a circumscribed indurated spot, which is somewhat painful on pressure and after micturition. The chancres have been foimd by Ricord to extend along the whole of the methra, even to the bladder ; and it is their presence in this canal that formerly led to the supposition of the identity of .syphilis and gonorrhoea, an ciTor which has been disproved by the test of inoculation ; the discharge from methral chancre producing the typical sore, that from gonorrhoea giving no result when introduced under the skin. The existence of chancre within the urethra may be suspected if the urethral dis- charge be small in quantity, and somewhat dark coloured, ichorous, aud sloughy in appearance. The chancre may be detected by everting the edges of the urethra, or, if situated too high up the canal to be seen, by being felt hard and nodulated through its coats. Chancres may also fonn on other parts where they have been accidentally m’ purposely inoculated. Thus I saw many years ago (1839) in Ricord’s Avards, a man, labouring under eczema of the legs, in Avhom the cutaneous disease had been converted into a scries of immense chancres by accidental inoculation I'rom a sore on the penis. ^ In women, chancres arc usually situated on the external organs of genera- tion, most usually just inside tbe iburchette or labia minora, very rarely indeed on the lining membrane of the Angina, but sometimes on the cervix or os uteri; a H 2^36 VENEREAL DISEASES. hence it is impossible ever to in’onouucc a woman free from cliaucre without examining these parts hj means of the speculum. Wlicii situated upon the external organs, they are not unfrequcntly concealed between the rugar, or in nooks and corners of tlic mucous membrane. In these cases, their presence may sometimes be detected by the labia being swollen and oedematous fr’om the irritation produced l.)y them. Diagnosis.—Tlic diagnosis of chancre is usually sutHciciitly easy, the pecidiar character of the sore enabling the Surgeon to recognise it in all its forms. In some instances, however, it is by no means easy to say positively whether an ulcer on the penis be or be not chancrous. It is especially difficult to distin- guish some forms of excoriated chancre fr’om herpes or aphthm on the prepuce or glans, or from those slight excoriations that many men habitually contract after a somewhat impure connection ; so, also, the wound resulting from a ruptured fi'temmr often presents a suspicious appearance. In these cases, how- ever, the absence of any specific character about the sore, its immediate occur- rence after connection, the general known tendency of the patient to those affections, and the fact of the inguinal glands not being generally indolently enlarged, wiU enable the Surgeon to diagmose the ulcer to be simply a local affection, and not the prelude to general syphilitic eruptions. When the prepuce is in a state of inflammatory phimosis, it is always extremely difficult to determine by mere examination whether there be chancres under it or not, though their bases indurated by inflammation may sometimes be felt through it. In the case of the phagedasnic or the sloughy chancre, there can be little diffi- culty in establishing the true nature of the affection. In those cases in which a comparison of the characters of the sore with one or other of the different recog- nised varieties of chancre failed in enabling the Surgeon to determine the true nature of the affection, it was thought at one time, when the local contagious ulcer and the phenomena attending the progress of syphilis were confounded together, that the influence exercised by mercury upon the sore would deter- mine whether the disease were syphihtic or not; the true chancres being sup- posed to be curable in no other Avay than by the internal admmistration of mercury ; but, although there can be no doubt that the influence exercised by treatment assists the Surgeon considerably in the diagnosis of obscure cases, yet it cannot be relied upon as a test of the nature of the disease, many venei’eal affections being readily curable by very simple means without mer- cury. It must be further recollected, that little practical advantage is gained • by experimenting on the contagious quality of the discharge ; because, if the patient have been exposed to syphilitic contagion, Avhen the sore comes imder the observation of the Surgeon it ivill be impossible to prevent his infection, which wiU have taken place in a very few hours after the application of the poison. Treatment oe Chancre.—The treatment of venereal sores has engaged the anxious attention of the most eminent Surgeons ; and so much difl'crencc of opinion and practice regarding it still prevails, that I shall not endeavour to discuss the subject generally, but rather confine my remarks upon it to that form of treatment Avhich has met with the sanction of the best Surgeons in this country, and which a tolerably extensive experience in hospital and piivatc practice has led me to consider as the most safe and effectual.LOCAL TREATMENT OF CHANCRE. 837 Tl)c treatment of chancre is of a local and of a conslUuUonal character. The local treatment has for its object cither to destroy the poisonous character of the sore, or to modify it so as to bring it into the state ol a hea thy ulcei ; the constitutional treatment is not only intended to facilitate this, but to prevent, if possible, infection of the general system with the poison of con- stitutional syiihilis, should this have been communicated with the local disease. Local Treatment.—This has for its object either the destruction or tlie modification of the specific character of the sore. The complete destruction of the local virus should always, if possible, be effected ; and if this can be done in the eai-ly stage of the disease, the healing of the sore will be much expedited. But, even though considerable time have passed before the Surgeon sees the sore, it is well to destroy the ulcerating and poisonous sm’face, that its further extension may bo prevented. This should bo effected by the appli- cation of caustics in a sufficiently concentrated form to destroy radically and at once the specific character of the sore, so as not only to save the pain, but to^ prevent the imtation attendant upon frequent applications. The nitrate of silver, which is frequently used for this puipose, is too weak to secure the effect it is intended tO accomplish, being apt to irritate and inflame, and not to destroy the chancrous surface, thus necessitating repeated and painful appli- cations. I consequently prefer to this the strong nitric acid, one application of which AviU very commonly suffice to annihilate the specific character of the sore ; though more energetic in action, it does not give rise to more pain than the nitrate of silver. It should be applied by means of a piece of wool, a glass rod, or a small dossil of lint wrapped round the end of a silver probe ; with this the sore may be freely mopped, and then, a stream of cold Avater having been pom-ed over it to Avash away any superfluous acid, a light poultice or a piece of Avater-dicssing should be laid on ; after the small slough produced by the caustic has separated, a healthy granulating siuface AviU be left. The caustic may be applied at any time during the continuance of the specific condition of the sore ; but AAhen once this has been destroyed, it should not be re-applied. The potassa fusa and the potassa cum calcc, though occasionally used, are far less manageable and not more efficacious applications than the nitric acid. "VVith the vicAV of modifying the specific character of the sore, there is no application so efficacious as iodoform. A small, quantity should be dusted on CAcry day, and the sore dressed dry Avith Cotton-Avool. It is most efficacious, and will often cure a soft chancre in a Aveek or ten days. These arc the means that are generally most useful in /Simple Chancres. In some cases, however, inflammation of the sore, or peculiarities in its situa- tion, demand modifications of the treatment. If there be much inflammation about the sore and prepuce, this must first be subdued by the application of cold poultices, or of lead and spirit lotion. When this is removed, if the sore have not lost its specific character, the caustic should be applied in the usual Avay. Should there be phimosis Avith discharge of chancrous pus fi’om under the tightened prepuce, it Avill be better to slit this up, so as to expose and freely cauterise the subjacent chancres. If the cut edges of the prepuce become inoculated, they must also be cauterised freely and ea,rly.^3S VENEREAL DISEASES. rt the chancres be situated round the orifice of an elongated and ti«ht prepuce, circumcision is the best means of removing the disease and the hi- convenience at the same time. The cut surface, however, will always become infected, and requires to bo freely cauterised with nitric acid. After the slough produced by the caustic has separated, the surface may begin to granulate healthily at once, requiring but simple dressings ; but in the majority of cases it will continue in a somewhat unhealthy condition, demanding special topical applications to cause it to cicatrise soundly. If it be weak and fungating, an astringent lotion, such as the foUo^\ing, will lie found most useful R Tannin, gra. xx ; Tinct. lavandulte comp. 5ij ; Vini rubri, gh'. Ft. lotio. Or a solution of sulphate of copper may be applied, and the sore touched from time to time with nitrate of silver. If there be induration at its base, the black or yello^v wash will perhaps be found the best application that can be used. When the chancre is indurated by syphilis, no attempt should be made to bimi away the indimated base with caustic, as it will prove unsuccessful, the cause of the induration being always beyond the influence of the caustic. In these cases, the best local application is generally the black wash. In the Phageclsnic Chancre a clifferent management is required. If there be much inutability about the sore, the nitric acid cannot be borne ; and hero the best application is an opiate lotion, conjoined perhaps with small quantities of the chloride of soda. If the part require more stimulation, a few drops of the dilute nitric acid may advantageously be added instead of the chloride. In these cases, however, the application of the strong nitric acid may often be reqiu’red at a later period, on the removal of the local irritation by the topical employment of sedatives. In many cases, the local inflammatory action is best removed at first by the application of the concentrated nitric acid, this being followed by opiate lotions or emollient j)oultices, and the caustic being re- applied whenever there is a tendency to extension of the disease. In Sloughing Chancre, when the prepuce is greatly tumefied, in a state of inflammatory phimosis, and of a deep red or piuqflish colour, -ufith threaten- ing of extensive gangrenous action, a director should be passed between it and the glans penis, and the swollen prepuce slit up. In this way tension is re- moved, and the extension of the sloughing action arrested. Any chanci’e that is exposed must then be freely touched with nitric acid. Should the parts already have fallen into a state of gangrene, emolfient and antiseptic applica- tions vdll generally be found to agree best : yeast, caiTot, opiate, charcoal, or chlorinated poultices should be employed, the sloughs removed, and any paiis, as portions of the prepuce, that are partially destroyed by the gangrenous action, slit up, so as to remove tension and lessen inflammation. In cases of inflammatory sloughing of the penis, the htemorrhage, that occasionally results from some of the blood-vessels of the organ being opened by this action, may, if moderate, be looked upon as highly beneficial, inasmuch as it is often followed by an arrest of the morbid process. If, however, it occm to an alarm- ing extent, the patient should be put under chloroform and the actual cautery freely applied. This not only stops the bleeding, but arrests the progress of the sloughing action. When once the chancre is healthily granulating, it must be dressed in the same way as any common ulcer.839 TREATMENT OF CHANCRE. 1,1 iisiii- lotions to any form of chancre, care should ahvays be taken keep •1 piece of hut soaked in the fluid constantly applied between the piepuce a ‘thi o-lans, and, in women, between the opposite labia ; for, unless this be done, the contact of the diseased and inflamed mucous surfaces with one anothei wi tend to keep up irritation and morbid action. _ Constitutional Treatment. - The Simple, Soft, or Encormted Chancre will readily heal under non-mercunal treatment ; but, contraiy to the opinion of many Sm-geons of the present day, I consider it much safer to put the patient upon a mild course of the gi-een iodide of mercury. The coustitutional treatment of Phagedeenic Chancre must be directed by creneral medical principles ; rest in bed, a mild diet, the administration of salines and opiates, in those cases in which there is inflammation and irritataon conjoined ; whilst in those in which there is a debilitated or cachectic condition, tonics, such as bark or iron, with good food and stimulants, may be required, together with opiates to allay pain and to procure rest. The preparations of iron, especially the ammonio-citrate and the tartrate, either alone 01 in com- bination udth sarsaparilla, are especially useful in these cases. In the phage- dcCiiic chancre mercury is seldom admissible, and does much harm if em- ployed to check any syphihtic taint that may be present with the sore. Indeed, it is the indiscriminate use of merciny in these cases that has, I believe, brought so much discredit upon this remedy in venereal diseases. But, although meremy is not generally admissible in phagedenic chancre, yet, in that form that is characterised by a white slough, it has been found useful by Wallace, and the utility of this practice I can confirm, having found it of service in some of the more rebellious varieties of this disease ; the drug must, howe'vei, be very cautiously administered, and in but small doses. In the Gangrenous or Slorighing Chancre, the constitutional powers of the patient will be found to be broken, and his general health depressed, so that depletory measures are seldom if ever required. The prepuce should be slit up, and free incisions should be made through the sloughing textimes, so as to take down all tension ; and as the fever subsides, or from the first if there be much asthenia, ammonia and bark, good nourishment, and abundant stimulants, will be required ; eventually the patient’s strength may be • supported by iron and quinine, and the instability of the system allayed by the free administration of opium ; the strong nitric acid should then be mopped freely over the parts, and afterwards charcoal or yeast poultices applied lintil the sloughs have sepa- rated. After the separation of the sloughs, the sore will usually present a clean appearance, the granulations cicatrising rapidly. It often happens that, when a portion only of the prepuce has been destroyed, the upper part being perforated, and the preputial orifice, with the imder part, hanging down mider the glans, the part thus projecting may be snipped off with advantage, and the organ thus moulded into a better shape. After a chancre has been healed in one or other of these ways, we must endeavour, by the general improvement of the patient’s health, to prevent or alleviate the manifestation of syphilis, should that malady have been contracted at the time of contagion. This is usually best done by putting him on a course of sarsaparilla with the mineral acids, and by scrupulous attention for some months to his habits of life. The syphilitic poison may linger for a great length840 VENEREAL EfSEASES. ot time in the system, not declaring itself by any overt manifestation so Ion" as the health continues good ; but, if the patient tall into a debilitated state, even though some yeai-s have elapsed, showing itself by some of its local eftects. Consecutive Symptoms of the Local Contagious Ulcer.—Chancres are not unfrequently followed by a series of affections which may bo termed consecutive, depending as they do upon the primary disease, but being local in their character, and presenting no evidence of constitutional infection. These consecutive symptoms are three in number : viz.. Contraction of the Cicatrix of the Chancre, Bubo, and Warts. Contracted Cicatrices.—Most excoriated chancres are healed without any cicatrix or other trace of them being left; but,] in the phagedienic and the sloughing chancres, there is always loss of substance, often to a considerable extent, and consequently a depressed scar. But in addition to these thicken- ings, one of another kind may take place. The situations of all venereal ulcers should be watched for some time, however readily that sore may have healed ; lest, the syphilitic virus having been introduced with the local irritant, in- duration should commence at the point of contagion, when the time of incu- bation or inactivity of the wus after its introduction has elapsed. Thus, a month or six Aveeks should pass away after the suspicious connection, before the Siu’geon pronounces the patient free of general syphilis. Bubo.—By bubo is meant an inflammatory enlargement of the lymphatic glands which receive the lymphatic vessels supphed to the inoculated surface. A bubo, though generally produced in the gi’oin by absorption of irritating- matter from chancres on the penis, may occur elsewhere ; as, for instance, in the axiUa, in cases of chancre on the finger ; in the submaxillaiy region, if the disease occur on the lip. The enlargements of the inguinal or other lymphatic glands that occur in cases of venereal chancre, are caused by several kinds of irritation. The glands may be irritated by concomitant inflammatory action about the penis, as when balanitis or phimosis is present; or they may be enlarged from the simple excitement of the parts, especially in strumous and debihtated subjects. In these cases the bubo is termed Sympaihelic, and the affection must be considered as a simple irritation and inflammation of the inguinal glands, which may speedily subside under proper antiphlogistic treat- ment of a mild kind, although in many cases suppiu’ation eventually takes place, constituting, in fact, a simple glandular abscess, presenting nothing in any way specific. Indeed, it scarcely ever happens that a chancre has existed for some days without the lymphatic glands in the groin becoming enlarged and somewhat indurated, especially those that lie parallel to Poupart’s ligament, their enlargement being attended with a degree of stiffness and dragging pain. The liability to this iiwitation and inflammation of the glands in the groin is greatly increased by the patient walking about or otherwise exerting himself. But I do not think that causes such as these influence the occuiTence ot the other and more serious affection of the l;^phatic glands ; namely, the virulent iuio, which appears to originate from direct absorption of the chancrous pus, without the interference of any external agency. When once the glands in the gi’oin have become virulently imtated, it is extremely difficult, it not impos- sible, to prevent suppuration fr-om taking place. Usually only one or two glands sup purate, although several may be enlarged ; and very commonly the841 PRIMARY BUBO. tliseaso is confined to one groin only, tliougli both may be affected, more par- rticnlarly it' the chancre be situated upon the thenum. I’he suppuration may be limited to the gland immediately affected, or it may extend into the sui- rounding areolar tissue, or even be chiefly confined to this. The true specific virulent bubo is essentially produced by the absoi-ption and Kleposit of the venereal virus in the substance of the gland, the tissue of which becomes poisoned ; so that we may consider with Ricord that a viru ent bubo is properly speaking, a chancre of an absorbent gland, differing only m seat from that which is situated upon the surface of the body. Ricord has observed, and I have often had an opportunity of testing the correctness of this obser- vation, tiiat the pus of a ^drulent bubo is as readily inoculable as that of aii ordinary chancre. This kind of bubo, then, may be considered as a .<^pec>fic abscess of the absorbent glands and surrounding areolar tissue. It rims the ordinary course of an acute abscess, often undermines the skin to a consider- able extent, with much red or purple discolouration, and, when it has biu’st or been opened presents a ragged sloiighly-looking cavity, having an unhealthy appeanince ; it most usually occurs about the second or third week after the first appearance of the chancre, but may happen at an earlier or at a later period, even after the chancre has itself healed. A rai-e form of bubo is that which forms within the abdomen in the lymjihatic glands in this situation. It is a very dangerous variety, and may prove fatal by rupture into the peritoneum and peritonitis. Primary Babo.—The French Surgeons have described a form of bubo that they call bubon cVemblee ox primary bubo; this is said to occiu- from the direct absoiption of the chancrous matter, without the previous formation of a chancre. Scarcely any satisfactory proof, however, has been given of the existence of such a bubo. It frequently happens that small excoriated chancres heal in a few days, before which time, however, the inguinal glands have become in-itated and enlarged ; and, as the enlargement of the glands goes on after the healing of the chancre, a bubo may be formed when all trace of its primary source has entirely disappeared. This primaiy bubo has fallen under my observation in one case only. Until that occurred, I doubted its existence ; and I am not yet ffully convinced that this suggested mode of origin is the true one. In the case refeiTcd to, a young man applied to me with a rather large abscess in the gToin, for ivhich I sent him into the Hospital. On being questioned, he denied ever having had any venereal disease, though he admitted having had intercoiu-se with a woman of the town. On examining the penis, no chancre, abrasion, or cicatrix could be discerned. The abscess was opened, and two ounces of rather bloody and very thick pus were let out; no enlarged glands could be seen. For the sake of experiment the pus wtis inoculated into the left thigh, and two distinct and well-marked pustules were produced. That such an eft’ect can be obtained by matter of very irritable character without any venereal origin, is shown by the cxpei’iments of several Surgeons who have succeeded in inoculating matter from itch and ecthymatous pustules ; hence it must not be concluded in this case that the bubo was consequent on the direct absorption of venereal matter along the lymphatics. Crop,piny Bubo.—In some cases the bubo, as has been well shown by Solly,•'^42 VENEREAL DISEASES. iissumcs a tciulcncy to creep or sj)x*ead over the neiglibouriiig integument, extending in this 'way to a considei’ablc distance dowoi the tbigb, upon tlie abdomen, or over the ilium. Tins creepimj buho is characterised by the peculiar semicircular or horse-shoe shape that the sore assumes, and by its tendency to cicatrise by one margin, whilst it slowly extends by the other; the cicatrix always being thin, blue, and weak, closely resembling that of a bum. Alter a bubo has disappeared, a good deal of indication may bo left in the glands ot the groin, perhaps ivith matting together of the surrounding areolar tissue ; and this induration may continue for years, or even for the remainder of life. The Treatment of bubo consists, in the first instance, in endeavouring to prevent the occurrence of suppuration ; and should pus form, in letting it out, and closing the wound which results. The Preventive Treatment of bubo is of considerable moment. It consists essentially in perfect rest of the part, and the application of leeches and of cold lead poultices. In reference to the appheation of leeches, there is a practical point of considerable importance that rerpiires attention—viz., that the leech- bites may become infected by the chancrous pus, and thus converted into a number of new chancres. This accident is best guarded against by covering the bites with collodion and plaster. If there be not much inflammatory action about the bubo, but this be indolent and chronic,, the application of blisters or disentient plasters, or of the tinctme of iodine, is occasionally useful. A plan of discutient treatment recommended by a French army-singeon, Malplaquet, I have foimd very ser- Aiceable in several cases. It consists in applying a blister about as large as a half-cromi over the sm’face of the inflamed gland, and dressing the raw surface produced by it with a piece of hut soaked in a saturated solution of the per- chloride of merciny for a couple of hours, when a white eschar ivill have formed ; a cold poultice should then be applied, and continued imtil all excited action has gone down. Ifj notwithstanding oin endeavours to prevent suppmation, matter form within or around the gland, as evinced by the swelhng becoming soft, boggy, and inflamed, a free opeiimg should be made by either a horizontal or a vertical incision, whichever will give the readiest outlet to the pus. If the integuments be much thinned, undermined, and of a bluish colom, I prefer making the opening with potassa fusa, as it destroys those unhealthy tissues which would otherwise interfere ivith the cicatrisation of the wound. The cavity that is now exposed presents a chancrous appearance, being irregular and sloughy, noth elevated and angiy red edges. This should be dressed with the aromatic wine and tannin lotion (p. 838). If the character of the sore do not improve, the potassa fusa should be freely applied to its surface and edges, and after the sloughs have separated, the granulations may be dusted ivith red preei- pitate powder ; the cicatrisation will in many cases be much facilitated by the application of a compress with a spica bandage, and by keeping the patient at rest. Not unfrequently the healing of the sore is interfered ivith by the over- hanging of the undermined edges ; these may occasionally be made to retract by being freely rubbed with the nitrate of silver. If this do not succeed, it may be necessary to pare them ofl' with a knife or scissors, or to destroy them843 SYFHILIS. u-ith potassa fusa ; the sore should then be dressed from the bottom, and treated on general principles. Sometimes sloughing action is "-'I' ^ open bilbo, and then extensive destruction of tissue may ensue, and m en lata ha^morrhage irom the femoral artery has been known to occur. It ^ sio-ns of syphilis concomitant with this local bubo, such as several indniated <dands, or rash upon the skin, it is as necessary to employ the conUnnons administration of mercury to cure the latter disease, as if the local afiection were not present. „ Venereal Warts.—Various forms of warts occur independently of any constitutional alfection, from simple continued in-itation of the ninco-cntaneons sm-tiices. They commonly occur on the prepuce or glans, and are especially apt to be situated in the angle between these parts ; they are of a bright-red colour, very vascular, and, if left without interference, may increase immensely in size and number, distending the prepuce, and giving a clubbed appearance to the penis ; there is always phimosis attending them, and the tension of the prepuce may be such, that ulceration occasionally takes place in it, giving lise to a protrusion of these gTOwths through an apertime in its side. These v arts are occasionally met with in the vagina, forming large, iiTegidar, cauliflower- looking masses. The Treatment consists in snipping and paring them off with scissors, and afterwards touching the parts from which they spring with nitrate of silver, to prevent their recmrence. In order to do this effectually, it is nccessaiy to lay open the prepuce in all those cases in which the glans cannot be freely exposed by chawing this back. II SYPHILIS, OR CONSTITUTIONAL VENEREAL DISEASE. Syphilis is a specific disease, transmissible (1) by the contact of its own specific pus with a tender or an abraded surface ; (2) by inoculation into the system through the medium of the secretions ; or (3) by hereditary taint under certain special conditions. It manifests itself not so much by the occurrence of any one special affection, as by producing a tendency to inflammation in various tissues and organs, and by impressing a peculiar form and comse on the inflammatory affections which it induces. With the true and intimate natme of syphilis we are at present entirely un- acquainted, and it would be useless to discuss those various hypotheses that refer it essentially to a specific cell, to a cryptogamic vegetation, or to a specific fever. We know this disease, like many others, by its effects only ; of its intimate nature ive are yet ignorant. These effects of a syphilitic inoculation are of two distinct kinds—the plastic and the ulcerative, the types of which exist in the primary sore, the hard base and plastic deposit around which reproduce themselves in a mst variety of forms, as in indurated glands, in nodes, and visceral guinmata. The ulcera- tion is constantly met with in those secondary and tertiary ulcers, invading skin, mucous membrane, and bones, which play such prominent parts in the ravages of constitutional syphilis, and which arc often preceded by, and are the results of, the disintcgi’ation of preilously deposited plastic gummata. In these respects, indeed, the progress of an infecting syjDhilitic sore closely resembles that of any other disease, which, primarily local, becomes secondarily constitutional, ivhcther it be the infective clot that leads to pya3inia, the germ^44 VENEREAL 1)1 EE A RES. of CcUicei, 01 the iioclulo ot caseous tubercle. However tnuch the course and pi ogress of these diseases may dift'er, the parts infected and the organs involved are generally the same, whether they he spematised ” by putrid or specific pus or by cancer-germs. Tlie early and more common conseipienccs of this affection have long been called and semiclary syphilis. These terms are ill suited to oin- pre- sent knowledge of syphilis, for it is now established that the induration at the point of contagion and the enlargement of the neighbouring lymphatic glands are as much a part of the disease as are the eruptions of the skin and mueous membranes ; which, in the great majority of cases, shortly follow the appear- ance of the former. But, as they have the sanction of custom, they may bo employed to indicate the different phenomena of the disease. Thus, Primary Syphilis is used to denote the indin-ation and ulceration that take place at the point of contagion, and the indolent enlargement of the nearest group of the lymphatic gland. Secondary Syphilis denotes the various eruptions of the skin and mucous membranes, and the inflammation of the eye and the periosteum, which take place in the first two years after contagion, but may retm’n by relapses of the disease after much longer periods. Lastly, the term Tertiary Syphilis includes pecuhar effects of sy[3hilis that appear in a small proportion only of those infected, and which affect the body, especially the viscera, "with processes of a slow inflammatory character, and are seldom set in action until the ordinary course of the disease has temiinated. Syphihs may, then, be regarded as presenting two orders of symptoms, the local and the constitutional. The Local or Primary symptoms occur only on the part to which the virus is immediately applied, and are the consequences of the introduction of the poison at the point of inoculation. The Constitu- tional or Secondary symptoms are the results of the absorption of the poison into the economy, whereby most of the tissues and many of the organs of the body me affected ; they are capable of hereditary propag'ation, and, in certain cir- cumstances, of transmission through the secretions. It would be altogether foreign to the scope of this work were I to enter into the very curious and interesting question as to the oriyin oj syphihs, a subject that admits of much dispute, and which has been keenly argued. After an attentive examination of it, I think there can be little doubt that syphilis was either introduced into Europe, or originated there de novo, towards the end oi the fifteenth centiu’y. There is no mention made by the medical writers, historians, or poets of antiquity of any contagious disease arising from sexual intercourse affecting the genital organs, and followed by constitutional symp- toms. The disease, when it first attracted public attention at the close of the fifteenth century, Avas looked upon as a new and previously unknown affection. It was supposed to be infectious as well as contagious, and its treatment was not understood. This Avould scarcely have been the case had it been previousl}^ known by personal observation, or even by tradition, to those then hving. It it had previously existed in the old world in a mild or modified form, different from what we now observe, it is certain that about this time it suddenly assumed ga-eater intensity, all its symptoms being aggravated in a remaikable and fearful manner, presenting characters ivhich had not been previous y alluded to, but which have often been reproduced in modern times ; as, tor845 TJiAKSMISSIBiLITY OF SYFUILLF. syphilitic discharges, or of the secretions of individuals labouring ^^der con- stitutional syphilis, is one that is still unsettled ; and, before it can be settled, very extended and accurate observation is required for the elimination of those sources of eiTor, which arc inseparable from an inquiry in ivhich the morality of patients often constitutes an important element. The following appear to me to be the chief points that may bo looked upon as decided with tolerable cer- tainty, though many of them arc still subjects of controversy. Constitutional syiihilis is contagions ; that is to say, it is communicable from one individual to another through the medium of the discharge of one of the sores that may form during its continuance. The fluids which by direct experi- ment are proved to contain the 'idriis in a communicable form, are the secretions of all the early syphilitic eruptions ; of these, the most common are the thin discharge of mucous tubercles, or of the initial ulcer. The blood itself, in more than one instance, has been inoculated vnth success. Professor Pellizzari, of Florence, inoculated a young Singeon, Dr. Bargioni, on the 6th of February, 1860, with blood taken from the vein of a woman suffering from syphilitic eruptions. The site of the inoculation, Avhich was carefully protected by a watch-glass cover, remained quiet for twenty-five days ; then a papula de- veloped, which in forty-four days became an ulcer with hard base. On the sixty-fifth day after inoculation, a roseola broke out on the trimk. Some un- certainty still exists as to whether the natural secretions of syphihtic persons are contagious of themselves, or become so by admixture with the blood or the discharge of syphilitic affections. The saliva, the milk, and the semen have lieen variously accused of this power. Syphilis is hereditarily transmissible fr’om parent to offspring; it is said to be communicable to the female by impregnation by a diseased male, and even tlnough the medium of the semen without impregnation. It is also believed by some to be communicable to the mother from a diseased foetus in utero, the parent being thus poisoned through her owm offspring. There are certain rare cases in w^hich it has been communi- cated fr’om nurses to children, and vice verad, by the act of suckling, through the medium of sores or mucous tubercles on the nipple or mouth, and possibly through the secretions. And there occasionally occur cases in which the malo' is infected by the diseased secretions of a syphilitic female during sexual inter- course, without there being any local sore through which the poison can be proved to be conveyed into the system. Ought a man affected by constitutional syphilis to marry ? is a question that is frequently put to the Surgeon, and one to which it is by no means easy to give a direct and immediate answer. That a man labouring under constitutional syphilis is lialile to infect a healthy w^oman, cither directly or through the medium of her foetus, or to become the progenitor of syphilised children, there can be no doifiit ; but that he wall necessarily do so, is certainly not the case. In answering the difficult question that is thus frequently raised, the SurgeonVENEREAL DISEASES. 846 must be very cautious ; lie must bear iu mind tliat the health and happiness ot a woman and the future of a family are often dependent on his reply ; and that, should he give his consent to the union and evil consecpiences follow, the whole 1 esponsibility will be thi’owei upon him. I think that it may be stated generally, that no man ought to many for at least twelve months after the first development of constitutional syphilis, even though all local signs of the disease have disappeared, and that he ought not to do so whilst any local manifestations of the disease arc developing themselves, whatever time has elapsed since the commencement of the attack. But, although I believe that it is safer to follow these general rules, yet I have seen so many cases in which marriage has been contracted by men still suffering from occasional manifesta- tions of the slighter forms of constitutional syphilis, and yet no evil consequences have been entailed either in wife or children, that, although it may be safer, yet it ctinuot be absolutely necessary to adhere closely to the advice just given. I know instances in w'hich men who had contracted sy[3hilis before marriage, and had been imperfectly cured—having for many years (ten, fifteen, or even twenty) occasional outbreaks of cutaneous syphilides, sarcocele, gummata, and other varieties of the advanced forms of the disease—have been the parents of perfectly healthy children, and have never infected their wives. It is tolerably W'ell established that syphilis is occasionally communicated with other affections. The matter of local chancre may thus be contaminated with the syphilitic virus, if the two affections be present in the same person. Syphilis has also been spread widely among young children by vaccinating them with lymph from a syphilitic child. One of the most unquestionable of these accidents is that which ocemred in the Subapennine valley of Eivalta in Piedmont, in 1861. Dr. Pacchiotti, of Turin, wiio was employed by the Italian government to report on the attack, has published an account of it. The facts are shortly these. In May, 1861, an apparently healthy child, named Chiabrera, wns vaccinated at Ptivalta with lymph sent from Acqui for the purpose. Ten days after this vaccination—on June 7th—forty-six healthy children wnre vaccinated at one sitting from this child. Again, on the 12th June, seventeen other healthy children were vaccinated from one of the forty- six. Thirty-nine of the first series of forty-six, and seven of the second series of seventeen, received syphilis with the vaccine disease, making a total of forty-six out of sixty-three children in a mountain village simultaneously inoculated wdth syphilis. Some months elapsed before the vaccination was suspected to have been the source of the childi-en’s bad health. By the 7th October, wfoen attention was drawm to this spreading disease, six of the forty- six syphilised children had died without recei-\ang any treatment, fointeen were recovering, and three w'ere iu a precarious condition. Tw-euty-three were dispersed through the country, and their condition was unknown until farther researches traced them out. In addition to the children, twenty women suckling them were inoculated wdth syphilis fr'om the children ; through the mothers, the disease had reached some ot the husbands and even the elder children of the different families. It is now generally believed that Anccine syphihs is only spread when blood is admixed wdth the inoculated lymph , that pure lymph will not spread sjq^hilis even when taken from a syphilised child ; and hence that vaccination may be safely practised in some cases from847 THE TBUE HUNTERIAN CHANCRE. a syiJliilisocI child, whilst in others infection will be conveyed when blood is mixed with the lymph. Progress.—The etfects of contagion are not immediately manitested. ilic time that intervenes between inoculation and actirity of the poison is called the incuhation period. It may be occupied in three ways. If the vehicle containing the virus be of a non-irritating character, the broken surface heals, and all trace of the inoculation disappears until the incubation is completed ; or, as the vehicle of the virus is often ims or discharge of an irritable kind, it may cause immediate inflammatory action at the point of inoculation. This irritation subsides in a short time, and the part then remains quiet until the incubation is complete, when the syphilitic poison betrays its jiieseucc 1)^ characteristic phenomena. An experiment of Vidal’s illustrates this : he inoculated the matter of a pustular syphilitic eruption on the arm of a medical student, which produced a pustule in a couple of days; this healed over in about a fortnight, and the exjreriment was supposed to have failed untib the thirty-fifth day; action then recommenced by the development of a papule, which subsequently rrlcerated, and general syphilis followed in due coiuse. It the syphilitic virus be carried in the pus of a local contagious chancre, the time of incubation is often occupied by the course of a chancre, Avhich may or may not have healed over when the syphilitic poison begins its action. This series of events, first a suppiuating contagious sore, and then hidiu’ation forming iii the base of the sore, or in its scar if the sore have already healed, is perhaps almost as common as the inoculation of syphilis miaccompanied by immediate local irritation; but the two morbid actions have no connection with each other, and are only accidentally co-existent. The length of this time of inactivity varies in different persons ; it is commonly twenty-five days. The shortest known period before the poison began to reveal its presence has been ten days, and the longest forty-six days. "When the time of active progress has arrived, the point of contagion becomes an elevated hard copper-coloiued spot, Avhich sometimes ulcerates, and if in’itated does so freely, forming the indurated or Hunterian chancre. Xot iinfrequently the surface scarcely ulcerates, but is simply eroded ; and even erosion may be wanting, in which case the only change on the surface is simple desquamation of the cuticle. The Indurated or True Hunterian Chancre, as it is termed, is not by any means so frequently met Avith as the other manifestations of syphilitic inoculation. The great characteristic of this form of venereal ulcer is the indm’ation of its edges and base ; and this character is met AAnth from the very first. Any ulcer, but more especially the chancrous excoriation, may during its progi’css become indurated fr-om undue stimulation, or from being otherwise inflamed ; but the Hunterian chancre is indurated from the first, and continues so throughout. This induration of the base is the result of a peculiar plastic effusion, Avhich, though it microscopically and chemically resemble ordinary healthy lymph, yet very distinctly differs from it in its vital characters. The dischai-ge from a soft chancre consists of pus, in no AA\ay distinguishable by the microscope from the pus on the surface of a granulating sore. The discharge from, a true Hunterian chancre, Avhen not subject to any undue irritation consists chiefly of epithelial debris, floating in a clear fluid, true pus-cells848 VE-NEllEAL DISEASES. being entirely absent. Besides the presence of induration, the Hunterian cbaneie is chaiacteiised by its circular shape, its elevation above the surround- ing parts, and sometimes by a very adherent grey slough that covers its surface. It is usually seated on the glans ; but not unfrcquently on the skin of the prepuee, or of the root of the penis. In this form of chancre there is almost invariably enlargement of the lymphatic glands in the groin. Seat and Numhei-. The indurated primary ulcers of syphilis are most frequent on the (lenitals, but not so exclusively limited to those parts as are- local venereal sores, because syphilis is communicated in various ways besides, that of sexual intercourse, and thus may appear on any part of the body., Fournier found that, of 472 cases of inoculation in men, 314 were on the- prepuce and glans penis, 10!) on other parts of the male organ, 12 only on the- mouth, 6 on the hands and fingers, and a few on the eyelids, tonsil, and naveL Syphilis not unfrequently occurs amongst Surgeons and accoucheurs as a. consequence of inoculation on the fingers, during the dressing of a venereali sore, or the delivery of a diseased woman ; and is also occasionally met with- among non-professional persons. It usually appears as a small sore by the side- of the nail and under its matrix, mth mirch swelling, redness, and pain in the finger, which becomes bulbous ; pain and swelhng of the axillary glands soon, follow. If the natiu’e of the disease be not rccog-nised, the ulceration will creep round the tip of the finger, have a foul and sloughy look, with exquisite tenderness, and, resisting all ordinaiy treatment, may be set down as malignant; on which supposition the amputation of the finger has been proposed and practised. I have seen at least four cases in which this extreme measure has been proposed, but in which, by a timely discovery of the true nature of the= affection, the finger was saved. In some cases of disgusting depra^•ity, chancres are met with at the margin' of the anus and on the lips and tongue. These are always indiuated ; and horn their foul surface, hard base, aud persistent character, may readily be mistaken for cancerous affections, but the diagnosis is easy, for it will usually be found; that they occur in girls and young women Avho have not reached the cancerous age; indeed in women at any period of life cancer of the bps is extremely j-are—so much so, that I have uever seen a case. Inoculation Avill always determine their true nature. Induration. The hardening of the tissues around the point of inocidatiou varies in the extent to which it is developed. It is most marked in the skin, where it takes the form of a nodule or lump, often no larger than a split pea, but sometimes as large as a walnut. Now and then, on the thin prepuce, it is spread Avidely in a shallow layer, and gives the foreskin the “ parchment indu- ration ” of Eicord. This induration remains for some time around the point of contagion, usually two or three months, though, when very scantily developed, it may vanish in a fortnight or three weeks. Ultimately it always disappears ; though, if irritated, it is very apt to break down into obstinate ulcem. It is maintained by many Surgeons of great authority, that induration-of the site of contagion is by no means a constant production. The numbei of cases where induration is not palpably evident is A-ery small; and, though ju’obably it is sometimes wholly wanting, it is a rare exception for it to be so. Much induration is often thought to produce a seA'cre course of syphilis, and849 TREATMENT OF PRIMARY SYPHILIS. probably this is generally true ; though the patient often escapes all subsequent symptoms, except a few spots on the skin and sore throat, especially when treatment is early employed. Indolent Enlargement of the Lymphatic Glands. The so-called mcMmt „ hul)o is the next change to follow induration of the point of contagion, which it accompanies or very closely succeeds. One gland enlarges first, and several follow ; the glands remain painless or only very slightly tender; the skin over them retains its natural colour and suppleness, and there is no doughy thickness, as in the acute suppurating bubo. In this state the glands, nevertheless, not unfre- quently suppurate, and an abscess forms around them. This accident is generally set up by violent exertion, such as dancing, riding, and the like ; but it has no special significance—it never yields a specific inoculable pus like the virulent bubo of the local chancre. The anatomical change in the glands themselves consists in congestion and the deposit of iiTegular fibro-plastic lymph, which produces their increased size. If the point of contagion be seated near the middle line, at the frmnum for instance, the glands in both groins are often enlarged. In weakly persons, the glands throughout the body become enlarged ; those at the back of the neck, especially, are very commonly enlarged dining the time of the eruption on the skin, and those of the axilla and other parts are sometimes included in the enlargement. This condition of the glands is accom- panied by a great increase in the proportion of colourless coi’puscles in the blood ; but both these alterations of the lymphatic system are temporary, and disappear spontaneously in a short time. Tbeatmeot.—Local Treatment, while of much value in the non-syphilitic venereal sore, is of little or no avail in the disease now under consideration; the causes of the local manifestations being beyond the reach of any direct application. The treatment must be directed to the neutralisation of the action of the poison, and its removal from the constitution, by remedies given so as to act generally on the system. The Constitutional Treatment of primary syphilis has undergone various changes according to the prevailing doctrine of the day. It had been decided by the Singeons of the last and early part of this century, that mercury acted as a specific against the syphilitic poison. This doctrine was so firmly established, that Hunter, and many of the great Surgeons of his school, looked on the curability of a sore without mercury as a proof that it was not syphilitic. About the commencement of this centmy, however, it was found by obser- vations of the Aimy-Surgeons, amongst whom Rose took a principal share in the inquiry, that the different forms of venereal ulcer, no distinction being then drawn between the local non-infecting sores and the ulcers which resulted fiom the contagion of the constitutional disease, were ciuable without the necessity of administering mercury, or indeed of having recourse to any specific treatment whatever. These observations, which appear to be founded on what was witnessed in bpain and Portugal dining the Peninsular War, led to the introduction of an important modification in the treatment of venereal sores ; viz., the non-mer- curial or stmph plan, as it is termed ; a mode of practice that obtained great VOL. I. 3 I850 VENEREAL BISEASES. lci\oiu, cUkI lifts been extensively tried. Of late years, however, a reaction has taken place in the minds ot most professional men, and mercury is again employed in the treatment of this disease, hut more moderately and scientifically, and consequently more successfully than before. The arguments in the favour of the non-mercurial plan of treatment are briefly these : that by this system of treatment the constitution of the patient is saved the introduction of a mineral which in many cases acts injuriously, and which, as the disease can be cured without it, may at all events be looked upon as unnecessary ; that secondary affections less frequently follow this plan than they do the administration of meremy ; and, lastly, that those distressing cases of constitutional syphilis which are common after mercurial com’ses, and which are said to depend upon a peculiar combination of the syphilitic poison vuth the mineral in the system, are never met with in persons who have under- gone the simple treatment. These arguments, however, on closer examination find fm’ther experience, have been proved to be not quite so conclusive as the supporters of the simple treatment appear to believe. That a great number, perhaps the majority, of cases of simple soft chancre, which we now know to be an affection of a totally distinct nature from syphilis, can be healed vfithout the administration of merciuy, is undoubtedly the fact ; but it is equally true in many instances that the indm’ated sore does not cicatrise properly unless the mineral be administered, or, if it do close, that it heals in an imperfect manner, readily breaking out agaiu. But it is a most serious error to confound the healing of ulcers with the cime of syphilis. The cicatrisation of an ulcer and neutrahsation of the constitutional affection are two distinct things ; and the test of the relative value of these two plans of treatment must depend rather on the influence they have over the coiu’se of syphilis, and on the character that the symptoms assume under one or other of these methods, than on the mere skinning over of the ulcer. I cannot agree with the statement that secondary symptoms are less frequent after the simple than after the mercurial treatment of syphihs. I have seen the non-mercurial plan of treatment very extensively employed at University College Hospital; indeed, it was formerly almost invariably practised there, more particularly in the syphilitic cases occuriing among the out-patients under Morton, who strongly advocated it ; and I have had repeated occasion to observe the frequency with which it was followed by secondary symptoms. In private practice, also, I have had considerable oppor- tunities of comparing the two methods ; and I can safely say that I have seen the simple treatment more frequently followed by secondary symptoms than the mercurial plan has been, when properly and judiciously employed. The supporters of the non-mercurial treatment, when obliged to admit the great frequency vdth which it is followed by secondary symptoms, argue that these, if more frequent, are less severe after the simple than after the^ mercurial plan ; and they state somewhat dogmatically, and it appears to me without any evidence to support their statement, that mercixry and syphilis together form a sort of ]poisonous compound in the system, which produces the worst and most destiuc- tive forms of constitutional syphilis. I deny entirely, however, that we have any proof of the existence of such a combination as that winch is supposed to be produced by syphilis and mercury ; no evidence with which I am acquainted has ever been adduced in support of the formation of such a poison in the851 MERCURIAL TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS. system. It is doubtless true that, after an ill-regulated mercurial course, cou- s'titutioiial sji)hilis of a very severe character may occasionally appear ; but this seems to me to be rather owing to mereury having boeii’improperly administered in constitutions that vnll not bear it, and in which, by the induction of a cachectic and depraved condition of the system, it favours the occurrence of some of the more severe forms of secondary syphilis, in the same way that any other lowering plan of treatment, or simple debility, might occasion them, but without the exercise of any specifically injiu'ious infiuence. Some of the worst forms of constitutional syphilis that I have seen, occun-ed in patients to whom no merciny had been adiniuistered, but in whom the syphilitic wus had been- ullowcd to exercise its influenee unchecked, save by the so-called simple treat- ment. I have seen the body covered by inmiense ecthymatous crusts and sores in one case, rupial uleers with destruction of the nose and palate in another, the worst kind of syphilitic cachexy with the tuberculo-pustular syphilide in 51 third, and extensive disease of the cranial bones and the clavicle in a foimth ; in none of which had any mercury been administered. But, though I cannot admit that the supporters of the simple or non-mer- •curial treatment of syphilis have brought forward any proof of its superiority •over the mercurial plan, and though my own experience has taught me that secondary symptoms occur after it with no less severity, and Avith far greater fi-equency than they do when mercury is carefully and judiciously administered, jet I am quite ready to allow that there are certain conditions of syphilis in which the non-mercinial treatment alone is admissible, the state of the constitution or the disease being such that mercury cannot be given in any form. In these cases such a treatment must be adopted, in accordance with ordinary medical principles, as will tend to subdue local action and improve the general condition. It is, indeed, especially in individuals of an unhealthy or strumous habit of body, or in those who are suffering from local visceral disease of some kind, and Avho are not affected by any indurated chancre, that this plan of treatment should be adopted. So also in those who, from the nature of their occupations, are subjected to much exposine to wet and cold, a mercurial course cannot Ido properly or safely administered, and the simple treatment is the most advisable plan that can be adopted. But even in such individuals meremj is often necessary to destroy the activity of the disease. In all other cases, I am certainly of opinion that merciny ought to be administered ; and this opinion appears to be entertained by the° most experienced Surgeons of the day in this country and abroad. The first question in connection with the employment of mercury in syphilis has reference to the principle on Avhich this remedy is administered. Whether mercury exercises a specific action over the poison of syphilis or not, has been much discussed, and is difficult of proof. I certainly think that it does act as u specific in syphilis, but that this specific action is much influenced by the •condition of the system, the habits of the patient, and the mode of admiii- ]stermg the remedy ; these conditions under certain circumstances tendino- to counteract or otherAvise to interfere with its operation. That mercury in many cases IS antagonistic to the syiihilitic poison, appears evident from the fact that m some instances hard ulcers will not heal unless it be given internally • fr-oni Its influence in speedily curing infantile syphilis and preA’cnting aftcr-manifes- 3 I 2852 VENEREAL DISEASES. tatioiis in the system ; and from the fact that, when properly administered iii heallhy constitutions, it may almost to a certainty bo expected to dissipate the ^•arious symptoms of constitutional syphilis. 'When it fails, as it doubtless does in many cases, to prevent the constitutional infection, or to eradicate this if it have appeared, the failure may usually be traced either to want of care in the administration of the medicine, or to the existence of an impaired state of the patient’s health ; though doubtless, in some cases, the most judicious em- ployment of mercury is unsuccessful in aiTesting the progress of syphilis. The essential practical point in the treatment of primary syj)hilis by mercury is to keep the patient under a prolonged and mild course, rather than a short and active one. The gums may be “ touched,” but profuse salivation should l)e avoided. In connection Avith the administration of mercury in syphilis, therefore, various questions present themselves, the proper detennination of which is of the first importance. These haA’e reference to the State of the Patient’s Constitution, the Condition of the Sore, and the Mode of Administration of the Remedy. The State of the Patienls Constitution influences materially the propriety of the administration of meremy. In ordinary healthy constitutions, it may always be safely employed ; but, if the powers of the system have been broken by excesses of any kind, if the patient be of a strumous habit of body, if he be in-itable, feverish, or excited, it must be given with great caution, or should be vdthheld until these states of the system are modified or removed. It is especially by administering meremy to strumous and cachectic patients^ or to those Avhose power's have been broken by habitual dissipation, that so much mischief residts ; and that it occasionally gives rise, by acting as a depressing agent, to local sloughing, or to some of the low forms of secondary syphihs. Mode of Administering Mercury.—The particular preparatwn of onercurij to be given, the length of time diming which it should be continued, and the rules to le observed during the merciulal course, are all matters that influence greatly the result of the treatment. Meremy may be administered in form Avays : by the mouth, by inunction, by subcutaneous injection, or by fumigation. When it is to be given by the mouth in early syphihs, and Avhen it is desirable to produce but a moderate effect upon the system, I prefer the iodide of merem-y, in doses of one grain three times a day ; or the Plummer’s pill, in five-grain doses twice or three times a. day, will be found extremely useful Avhen the constitution is someAvhat irri- table. If it be desirable to produce a rapid effect upon the system, five grams of blue pill may be given night and morning. The other prepai’ations of mer- ciu’Y are not, I think, required in the primary form of the disease. When it is required to produce a moderate effect, especially in someAvhat delicate persons, without irritating the system or inducing much salivation, the iodide io ppTininlv In bfi nrefeiTed to all other preparations.853 SECONDARY OR CONSTITUTIONAL SYPHILIS. every night unci morning; or by putting a similar quantity upon a piece of lint and letting the patient wear it during the day and night iir each axiUa. It must be borne in mind that the orifices of the sweat-glands and haii- Ibllicles become fiUed with the ointment ; so that, should salivation commence, ^ it is impossible at once to arrest the absoi-ptioii of the mercury. . \ The duration of the mercurial coimse must depend upon the effect produced upon the sore. The course need not be continued until this has cicatrised, but should be persevered in until all specific action has ceased, and the sore has acciuircd a healthy and healing state. This impression is seldom produced upon the sore, without a slight effect upon the mouth having been previously induced ; the gums becoming spongy, red, and swollen, and an increased flow of saliva taking place. It is never necessary to continue the mercimy so long, or to give it to so great an extent, as to produce veiy profuse salivation. It was in attempting to do this, and by administering the remedy in too laige a quantity, and too rapidly, that the older Sm-geons produced such injmious consequences. The effect upon the sore, rather than that upon the gums, should be oiu’ guide as to the proper time for discontinuing the mercurial. The rules to be observed during a course of merciuy exercise considerable influence upon the effects produced by it. The system should always be pie- pared for its administration by a free piu’ge. While it is being given, the patient should, if possible, be kept in bed, or at aU events be confined to the house, taking as much rest as possible ; the diet should be moderate and unsti- mulating, and the dress be as warm as the season will admit. If the mercury be given by the mouth, and gripe, it will be found useful to combine it vuth capsicum. If it purge, small doses of opium may advantageously be adminis- tered in conjunction with it. After it has been carried to the full extent deemed advisable, it should not be suddenly left off, but gTaduaUy discontinued by diminishing the quantity daily during a week or ten days. If it be given in accordance with these rules, and in proper constitutions, we shall seldom find any of those injinious effects produced that were formerly described as resulting fr-om the administration of this mineral; those severe and extensive forms of idceration of the mouth, leading to necrosis of the jaws, and the mercinial erythema or erethismus described by the older Surgeons, are now happily almost matters of history, being but seldom if ever met "with. SEOONDABY, TERTIARY, OR CONSTITUTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OP SYPHILIS. The introduction of the syphilitic poison into the general system gives rise to two very important groups of phenomena : first, those that affect the system generally, influencing deeply the condition of the blood and the nutrition of all the textures of the body, occasioning febrile disturbance, followed by eina- ciation, cachexy, and general evidences of mal-nutrition : secondly, a variety of local diseases, which arc characterised by distinct phenomena :—1. Modi- fication of the skin and mucous membrane, as observed in mucous tubercles, psoriasis, and analogous affections, and ulcerations, affecting the skin and mucous membranes in various parts of the body ; 2. The deposit of lowly^54 VEXEUEAL DISEASES. organised Ijmph in A'arious tissues and organs, as tlie periosteum, the iris, testes, &c. ^ The period at -which sypliilitic eruptions appear usually varies from six ■weeks to SIX months alter the formation of the indurated sore. Occasionally secondary syphilis shows itself earlier, about the second or third -week, Avheu it may be coincident with the existence of primary syidiilis. Most commonly its symptoms are progressive—the milder, such as the affections of the skin and mucous membrane, occiUTing fii'st ; the more severe, as those of the bones and internal organs, afterwards : but in other cases this progression is not observed, symptoms of great intensity setting in early, without being preceded by those of a slighter kind. It is extremely difficult to say Avhen syphihs can be eradicated from the system ; and indeed it is a cpiestion whether it may not impress the constitu- tion in a peculiar way, modifying certain actions during the rest of life, as we know to be the case in other specific diseases, such as cow-pox or scarlet-fever. Certain it is that, if neglected or improperly treated, it wiU affect the system lor an indefinite time, declaring its existence by exciting and inodifying various local inflammations years after the original absorption of the poison. It is tolerably clear that a person Avho has once had the usual coiu’se of syphilis and has recovered from this malady, cannot have it a second time, though he con- ti’act a fresh chancre. This rule is from time to time proved to be generally true by the occasional obseiwation of undoubted exceptions, where repetition of the disease from re-inoculation of the -virus takes place. But such cases are exceedingly rare, and occur only after an interval of some yeai’s has elapsed between the two attacks. Hutchinson has related a very interesting example of this kind in a medical student, who also suffered from two attacks of small- pox. Daily experience shows that in many constitutions syphilis cannot be eradi- cated, and that in most others, when once it has occiu-red, it is apt, even when apparently cured, to modify certain cutaneous and other affections in a remark- able mamier, after a lapse of many years ; sho-wing clearly that, if the poison no longer exist in the system, the constitution has received a peculiar impress from it, which it is long in losing. E. Wilson attributes many of the ordinary non-specific cutaneous diseases to the latent influence of constitutional syphilis. These remote effects of syphilis have by Eicord been called Tcriiury. Tliis term is convenient, as indicating a j)eculiar stage of the constitutional manifes- tations, in which the tissues are more deeply affected than in the secondary forms of the disease. There is no distinct line of demarcation between secondary and tertiary syiihilis. It is impossible to say Avhen the disease ceases to be secondary and begins to be tertiary. The extremes of each stage are distinctly recognisable as belonging to one or the other group. Thus the rashes are undoubtedly secondary—the gummata as certainly tertiary; but the allocation of marry of the irrtermediate corrditions is iU-defirred. It is a remarkable fact, rroted by Ijarrce- rearrx, Berkeley Hill, and Wilks, that the severity of the tertiary phenomena is irrthe inverse ratio of that of the secorrdary. This fact is particrrlarly rroticeablc iir tertiary syphiloma of the rrervorrs system; arrd what is also remarkable is this, that marry of the more chrorric arrd severe cases of tertiary syphilis arc the resrrlt of but slight primary sores ; arrd although it would rrot be possibleniENOMEXA OF CONSTITUTIONAL SYPHILIS. 855 to say that the severity of the tertiary disease is in the inverse ratio of ^at of the primary, as wc may say ivith respect to the secondary, yet it may be afhrmed that the severity of the tertiary symptoms has no direct relation to the size, jicrsistence, or severity of the primary disease. The tertiary disease is more chronic, less contagious, and less easily heredi- tarily transmissible than the secondary. It differs in this respect also, that it is more characterised by localised hyiier trophies, by lowly organised plastic deposits, and less by acute inflammatory mischief and ulceration, than the^ secondary. Simon explains this fact by the gradual weakening of the syphilitic poison, which, in its stronger doses, capable of producing acute inflammatory phe- nomena, will in its more chronic and weakened form only be capable of dei'eloping hypertrophic changes and tumour-formations. lYe thus see a continuous chain of pathological sequence estabhshed betM’’een the ulcerated induration of the primaiy sore, the acute, often febrile, inflam- mation of the secondary disease, with its ulcerative tendencies, and the more chronic forms of tertiary syphilis, with its gummata and localised neo- plasms. Although the disease may continue to modify the system for years, or even for life, yet it seldom proves fatal. In some cases, however, death may occur, either by the cachexy that is induced, by the supervention of phthisis, or by caries of the skull or nodes of the drua mater, and disease of the brain and cord. Fatal and specifle syphilitic diseases of the limgs and brain have been described of late years with much care, though there still remains a good deal to be ascertained of the relation of syphilis to these changes in the brain and other viscera. It is especially when the disease has reached the tertiary stage, that it runs so protracted and tedious a course. When the syphilitic manifestations are conflned to affections of the cutaneous and mucous surfaces, the disease may, and occasionally does, wear itself out—the mate)-ies morU being apparently can’ied off by the secretions of these tissues ; and it is only in this way, I believe, that the affection can be eradicated from the system. That constitutional syi^hilis is dependent on the absorption of the syphihtic poison into the blood, and its consequent general diffusion tlmough the system, there can be little doubt. Not only is this rendered evident by the great variety of tissues and organs in which it manifests itself locally, but also in the induc- tion of the peculiar sy|Dhilitic cachexy. Phexomexa.—Constitutional syphilis may affect the following tissues and organs, and usually docs so in the order in which they are mentioned ;—viz., the skin, mucous membranes, periosteum, and bones ; the throat, tonsils, palate, eyes, nose, larynx, tongue, and testes. The first general disturbance of syphilis is often ushered in by febrile symptoms. In proportion to the severity of these, arc usually the rapidity of the progress and the extent of the local manifestations. In this febrile dis- turbance, the nutrition of all the tissues of the body becomes seriously im- paired, and the patient acquires a peculiar cachectic look. In other cases the patient gi’adually falls into a feeble and emaciated condition, becoming sallow and earthy-looking, with loss of hair, and depression of mental and bodily vigour. Ill this condition, not only arc the nutritive functions impaired, as isVENEREAL DISEASES. 856 CYidencecl by his becoming weak and thin, but the reparative actions are lessened, wounds do not heal kindly, and fractures arc slow in unitinr^, and may not unite at all until antisyphilitic remedies are administered. I he syphilitic affections occurring on the skin and mucous membranes are usually secondary, though some belong to the tertiary group ; whilst those ot the bones and different organs, as the larynx and testes, are commonly tertiarj'. Although the integimiental structures are usually first affected, yet sometimes the disease first attracts attention by its attacks upon the deeper and more important tissues, the symptoms of its progress on the skin and mucous mem- branes having been entirely overlooked. In women, it is constantly the case for the eruptive stage to be confined to a few mucous patches of the vulva and excoriations of the fauces, the former only of which are sufficiently annoying to attract the patient’s attention. CmcuMSTANCES iNPLUENCHfG- PROGRESS.—The Severity and manifestations of general disorder which follow the contagion are very various ; thus, a widely and long indimated ulcer foretells mth few exceptions a long and severe coiu’se of syphihs ; so, also, a short interval between the appearance of the symptoms of general disorder at the point of contagion will also indicate a severe course of the disease, and a long interval a mild course of the after-consequences. That the treatment of the primary sore exercises considerable influence, cannot be doubted. The severity of the coiu’se of syphihs is, I believe, materially lessened, and not in any way increased, by a mercurial coiu’se, if that course be properly conducted. The state of the yMtienVs health also determines to a great extent the kind of attack he wiU have to undergo. If, after the cure of the primary disease, his health continue good, the patient may almost wholly escape finther symptoms of the disease ; but if the health be broken or cachectic, then secondary syphilis AviU occiu’ contemporaneously with, or at a very early period after, the primary disease ; and, indeed, I generally look upon the chance of the speedy super- vention of secondary syphihs as more immediately dependent on this than on any other cause. It is remarkable for how long a time the syphilitic poison Avih continue dormant in the constitution without producing any local manifes- tation of its existence, until this is developed under the influence of a broken state of health. I have had under my care an extremely severe case of con- stitutional syphihs, in which twelve years elapsed after the occmTence of the primary disease, during the whole of which time no secondary affection was observed until the patient’s health gave way from other causes. And I have also had imder my care an officer, in whom a very severe form of constitutional syphihs occiuTed, for the first time, after salivation for hepatic disease, five years after the primary sore had been contracted—no constitutional manifes- tation having attracted the patient’s notice in the meanwhile. Not only does a state of iU-health hasten the occiuTcnce of secondary syphihs, but cachexy, neglect, or indifference to its existence may keep it up indefinitely. The question as to there being any connection between the nature of the primary sore, and the character of the consecutive constitutional affection, has been much discussed ; and I agree Avith Carmichael, that the different forms of primaiy sore AviU, if left to thcmselA'cs, bo folloAA'cd each by its oaa n peculiar train of constitutional symptoms. In fact I am fidly convinced, as the resultS57 ]'21]<Jj[TMENT of constitutional SIPIIILIS. of much and close observation on this point, that there is a general coiTCspon- clence betn-een the kind of ulcer and the manifestations of constitutional syphilis tliat may follow it; both, in fact, being chiefly dependent upon the state of tlie patient’s health. The same condition of system, for instance, that wli occasion a local chancre to assume the phagedmnic or sloughing form, will occasion rupia or ecthyma, with necrosis or caries of the bones, as the consti- tutional manifestations of syiihilis ; whereas that which occasions the indurated chancre will ecpially modify the secondary disease, so that it assumes a squamous form, accompanied perhaps by iritis and periosteal disease ; and the soft or excoriated chmicre will generally be followed by papular or roseolar eruptions, Avith mucous tubercles on the tongue or throat. That these sequences are of very frequent occmTence I cannot doubt, having frequently observed them ; and that they are not of constant occurrence is, I believe, owing to the character of the constitutional affection being modified, by the state of the patient’s health having undergone a change subsequently to the cure of the primaiy sore, or to the patient not having been infected with syiihilis when he con- tracted the local sore, and having thus not been rendered liable to constitutional infection. A patient having indurated chancre, will usually get psoriasis as the secondary cutaneous disease ; but if he fall into a cachectic state of health between the healing of the chancre and the supervention of the constitutional affection, rupia wiU manifest itself. Treatmek^t.—In the treatment of constitutional sjqdiilis, oim object is not so much to relieve or to remove any local morbid condition, as to eradicate a poison from the system ; and, indeed, the vmrious local manifestations, more especially those that appear upon the cutaneous and mucous surfaces, may possibly be efforts of uatme for the elimination of the virus from the system thi-ough the mediiun of the great excretory and emunctory organs ; and it is often apparently by aiding this natinal action by the administration of those remedies that act upon these tissues, that the poison is most effectually eradicated. Dm-ing the continuance of the pyrexia which often ushers in the secondary symptoms, little can be done in the way of specific means for the removal of the disease from the system ; rest and mild antiphlogistic treatment being aU that can be accomplished during this, the stage of invasion and of constitu- tional reaction. Great rehef is, however, afforded by a feAV doses of merenry given so as to affect the system. At a later period, when the cachexy Avhich is attendant on the disease has declared itself, attention to the hygienic and dietetic management of the patient is of the utmost importance ; a hght noiu’ishing diet, often accompanied by the moderate lAse of wine or beer, and in some of the lower forms of syphilis in broken constitutions, a general tonic plan of treatment, such as the administration of bark, quinine, or iron, and more especially of cod-liver oil, with the mineral acids and sarsaparilla, are required in combiiiation Avith the more specific means that Ave possess for the eradication of the disease fr’om the system. These hygienic and tonic remedies must be administered in accordance AA'ith general medical principles, and no special instructions need consequently be laid down for their use hero. The treatment of syphilis is conducted on one of these principles :—1, by the administration of mercury, Avith the vicAV of directly and specifically elimi-VENEREAL DISEASES. 8s8 natino- the poison froni the system ; 2, by tlic preparations of iodine, which aic supposed to be specific in a minor degree than mercury in this disease: and 8, by simple attention to the state of the general health, ivithout any attempt at specific treatment. These different principles may be employed simul- taneously or consecutively. As a general rule it may be stated that, the loimer the inten-al that separates the constitutional from the primary symptoms, Uie more they partake of a tertianj character, the less necessity will there be for specific treatment, and the more important will be the employment of all means calculated to improve the health. ^ Ot the value of mermrij in constitutional syphilis, eveiy Surgeon of expe- liencemust have had abundant proof. It may admit of doubt whether mercury can be justly considered as exercising a specific action, as there are some cases of the disease that it certainly does not appear to influence in a beneficial manner, and others the severity of which is certainly increased by the adminis- tration of this remedy ; but it appears to me that in these cases it is rather the patient’s constitution, which does not bear the remedy weU, than the disease that is at fault. We know that in many states of the system, and in many individuals unaffected by syphilis, mercury acts injmdously, more especially when anything like cachexy is present; and we caimot but suppose that the same injimious influence on a particular habit of body must continue, though it be contaminated with the poison of syphihs. The best proof that we possess of the influence of mercury over constitutional syphilis—an influence, indeed, that ahnost approaches to the natime of a specific action—is in the case of infantile syphilis ; here mercury wiU not only ciu’e the disease, but will eradicate the virus from the system in a way that no other remedy can accomplish. In the treatment of constitutional syiDhilis Avith merciuy, everything depends on the proper administration of the remedy at a suitable period of the case, and in a fitting condition of the constitution. The question as to the pro- priety of the administration of meremy in constitutional syphilis, the par- ticular preparation to be used, and the period of the disease in which it should be given, must be determined in a great measure by the previous treatment of the primary disease, by the condition of the patient’s general health, and by the din-ation of the secondary symptoms. If merciuy have been freely given, perhaps in repeated, irregular, and ill-conducted courses, for the ciue of the primary affection ; if the patient have fallen into a cachectic state, haifing lost flesh, colour’, appetite, and spirits ; if the constitutional affection have assumed the tertiary form, and have deeply implicated the bones, merciuy should not be given at all; or, at all events, not ivithout proper previous preparation. In these circumstances I think we should endeavour, if possible, to remove the constitutional affection without mercury. It is true that in marry cases ive shall not succeed in doing so ; but at least ive improi^e the health, check the disease, and brirrg the patient irrto a proper condition to sujrirort a merciuial coiuse, should it be thought necessary everrtually to subject him to orre. It is in these corrditiorrs of the system that the mtro-nviiruiticacklixaA.sarsaparill((> are of much service. From twerrty to thirty minims of the dihrte acid, with half arr ourree of the fluid extract of sarsaparilla irr four ounces of ivater, may be admirristcred three times a day. To this the iodide of potasmnn, in five-treatment of constitutional syphilis. 859 <n-iiia doses, may often be ad\-antageously added ; or this salt may be given alone in some bitter infusion, as of cascarilla, quassia, or bark ; or, n tne patient be in a A’ery caehectic and emaeiatcd state, in cod-liver oil. ^ ihc iodides of sodium and oUimmon iam have also been highly spoken ot; especially by some Italian practitioners, in the treatment of constitutional syiDliilis. In the more advanced cases of the disease, when it has assumed the tertiary fomi, and the constitution is much broken and the patient amemic, the preparations of iron may be given with much advantage. AVhen there is gi-eat emaciation, I have found the combination of the iodides of potassium and of iron with cod-hver oil, or the tartrate of iron in sarsaparilla, to be especially beneficial. But useful as these remedies, especially iodide of potassium and the dilute mineral acids, unquostioiiably are, more especially when administered in the compound decoction of sarsaparilla, I do not believe that they exercise any specific influence on the disease, or that they do more than relieve or remove local manifestations, often of a troublesome and disfiguring character ; failing alto- gether to cure the constitutional alfection and to eradicate the virus from the system, for which purposes merciuy will at last be required. Their gi-eat utility appears to consist in removing cachexy, and in restoring the vigour of the nutritive and reparative actions, which are in abeyance ; and, by improA-ing the general tone of the system, in enabhng it to resist more etfectuaUy the advance of the disease, and in some cases, perhaps, to allow this to Avear it§elf out. That great advantage results from maintaining the tone of the system in syphilis, is undoubted ; ive always fiud that the intensity of the ravages of the syphilitic poison is in direct proportion to the debility and want of resisting power in the constitution of the patient. Besides being useful in this way, these remedies are often of service in removing local affections, and in repairing the injury inflicted upon tissues aud orgaus by the low and specific inflammation that is set up in them. In this respect, indeed, more particularly in its advanced or tertiary stages, when the specific nature of the disease is to a great extent worn out, and little remains but to correct the cachexy and mahintrition that have been left as the result of long-con- tinued ill-health, nothing can exceed the value of these remedies in constitu- tional syiAhilis. I do not, however, believe that the disease can be eradicated from the system by these means, or that any of these remedies, even the iodide of potassimn, can take the place of mercury in the treatment of constitu- tional syphilis ; indeed, I cannot call to mind a single case in which this form of the aftection has been radically and permanently cured AAothout the adminis- tration of mercury. Those cases in Avhich they exercise most beneficial influence, are certainly instances in Avhich mercury has been injudiciously em- ployed, either for the primary or the secondary disease, and in Avhich the powers of the constitution have in this Avay been sapped. In these circumstances, a course of the iodide of potassium, of the mineral acids, or of the tartrate of iron ill sarsaparilla, should always bo administered, Avith a vioAV of improving the patient’s general health. Looking, therefore, upon mercury as the only remedy Ave possess that in- fluences directly and permanently the syphihtic poison, I think that it should always bo administered in a full course during some period of the treatment of constitutional syphilis. The time at Avhich it should bo given is of considerableVENEREAL DISEASES. S6o importance ; thus, it is usually better not to aclmiuister it until the initiatory pyrexia has subsided under the use of ordinary antiphlogistic treatment; nor should it bo given if there be a very marked cachexy. After this has'been lomoAcd, ho^ve^el, by other means, the employment of mercury may be proceeded Avith. In administering this remedy for constitutional syphilis, we must not give it largely, so as to affect the system rapidly, but as a mild coiu-se for some weeks, so as to act freely upon the secretory and excretory organs, and thus to elimi- nate the poison fr'om the system. The most useful preparations are the per- chloride, in doses fr’om the twelfth to the eighth of a gi-ain; or the green iodide in one-grain doses three times a day. These should be given Avith sar- saparilla, AAdiich keeps up the poAver of the system and actsfr-eely upon the kid- neys and the skin. The merciuy should be continued for at least from three to six weeks, until a decided improA^ement has taken place in the constitutional symptoms. I do not think it desirable to produce salivation ; all the good ■effects of mercury can be obtained far short of this ; and, indeed, if the remedy be pushed to such a point as to affect the mouth or gums, it AviU com- monly act injuriously, by depressing the powers of the system too much. I therefore think it Avell to suspend its administration Avhenever an impression has been made upon the disease, and before its depressing effect has been pro- duced. The cautions necessary dining the merciu’ial course, when administered in secondary syphilis, are precisely similar to those that we liave described as necessary during the primary treatment of the disease. In some cases of constitutional syphilis, affecting the skin and more super- ficial structiu’es, meremy may conveniently be administered by f umigation. This plan of treatment, which has been especially recommended by Langston Parker and H. Lee, consists of a combination of vapom-bathing and of mer- curial fumigation ; and these gentlemen speak in the highest terms of the Anlue of this remedy in syphilis, as shortening the duration of ordinary treat- ment, and permanently ciu’ing the disease without the constitution of the patient being in any Avay injured by its employment. The baths may also be associated AAuth appropriate internal treatment. During the use of the fumi- gations, the patient should be dieted, and be put on a full com’se of sarsa- parilla. The bath may be administered ei'ery second day, and should con- sist of about a drachm of cinnabar slowly volatilised by means of a spirit- lamj), at the same time that steam is disengaged from boiling water. In this AA'ay I have often used fumigations at the Hospital and in private practice, and AA'ith veiy great success, in cases of syphilitic cachexy with extensive cuta- neous disease of an ecthymatous or rupial character, in constitutions in which mercury could not be borne in any more active^foim. H. Lee prefers calomel as the material to be A'olatilised, twenty to forty grains being used on each occasion. Subcutaneous injection of mercury has been employed by Lewin and others Surgeons on the Continent, and by Walker of Peterliorough in this country. The salt used is the perchloride, of which from one-eighth to one-fourth of a grain is injected in solution in 15 minims of Avater. Sigmund of ^ ienna, Avho has tried this remedy in tAvo hundred cases, insists strongly on the neces- sity of rest after the injection, so as to obviate the occurrence of abscess and86i S YPIIILITIC SKIN-A FFEOT 10NS. other untoward consequences Avhich have heen ohseiwed to follow it. The in-ecise value of the subcutaneous injection of merciuyin syphilis has, it seems, vet to bo determined. Sigmund believes it to be most useful in the constitu- tional forms of the disease affecting the more superficial structures and the- osseous, muscular, and fibrous tissues. ■Whatever plan of treatment is adopted, it should bo earned out for a sufficient length of time ; great evil often resulting by intercepting it too suddenly, and being contented with the removal of the local mischief, whilst the disease is left firmly seated in the constitution. Local Secondary Affections.—We shall next proceed to describe the- character and treatment of the different local forms in which constitutional syiihilis manifests itself. These may be considered as they affect different tissues and organs, and require separate examination, according to the part that is influenced by them. We shall consider them as affecting the skin; the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, tongue, palate, and laiynx ; the eye, bones, testes, and muscles. 1. Syphilitic Affections of the Skin.—Syphilo-dermata or Syphilidos present various modifications of appearance, corresponding veiy closely to the different groups of idiopathic cutaneous diseases; thus we find exanthematous, papular, squamous, vesicular, pustular, and tubercular syphilitic affections of the skin, with various ulcers and growths. These differ from the corresponding" simple cutaneous diseases, in their redness being more dusky or coppery, in leaving stains of a bromiish or purplish hue, in their outhne being circnlar, and in their crusts or scabs being dark, blackish, thickj and rugged-looking. Besides this, syphilis modifies materially the general character of the cuticle, causing it to assume a yellow or earthy tint, and to be rough or powdery. The worst forms of these affections are commonly met wdth on the face and more exposed parts of the body. Syphilitic skin-diseases arrange themselves imder the following groups. The Roseola consists of blotches of a reddish-brown or coppery tint, which becomes more distinct as the redness declines ; they vary in size from small circular spots to large and diffused patches. These are usually first observed about the abdomen, and commonly occur early in the disease, often before the- primary sore is healed. Syphihtic roseola usually occurs in patients who have had chancrous excoriation, and is very frequently accompanied by an erythe- matous condition of the throat. The Squamous syphilidc occurs in small patches of an iiTegular shape, of a red and somewhat coiipery colour, which are commonly covered with thin filmy scales. In many instances the patches are, however, quite smooth, so as to have a glazed and ahnost shining look. They are usually situated on the inside of the arms and thigh, often on the scrotum and penis, even occiUTino- on the glans. They also frequently appear on the palms and soles, where deep fissures and cracks are mot with. About the lips, the squamous syphilide o-iyes rise to deep and troublesome fissures. It is often associated with a deeii’and excavated ulcer of the tonsils, with inflammation of the iris, and not uncom- monly with disease of the periosteum and bones, and ahnost invariably follows the indurated chancre. Associated with this condition are large brown patches or maculai, which occur on various parts of the body.S62 VENEREAL DISEASES. The Vesicular syphilicle is of very rare occurrence. In one case n'liich fell nuclcr my obsel^ation, it appeared in the form of clusters of small pointed vesicles, which, on drying, left grey or brownish crusts and coppery marks. Syphilitic Puslules, on the contrary, commonly occur ; beginning as small hard papulte of a coppery hue, slowly softening in the centre into a small deeply seated pustule, having a large brown or coppery areola, and forming speedily large circular dark-brown or even black scabs; usually flat and irregularly crusted, at other times conical. When flat, they constitute syphilitic ecthyma ; when conical, the rupial form of the disease. After their separation, troublesome ulcers of a circular shape, and with a rather foul surface, are ■commonly left. This disease first appears upon the face, but speedily sliows itself on various parts of the body, more especially on the extremities; it is always indicative of constitutional cachexy, and often appears at an early period after phagedmnic chancre ; when it follows other forms of chancre, this is, I believe, orsdng to the patient’s system having m the meantime fallen into n loAV and broken state. Syirhflitic Tubercles commonly occin as an advanced or tertiary symptom ; they appear as hard, smooth, flat, and elevated bodies of a reddish-brown or pui’plish colorm, seated on the face, the tongue, the limbs, the penis, or the uterus. They may be resolved by proper treatment, but have a gveat tendency to ulcerate and to destroy the parts on which they are situated, giving rise to large, deep, foul, and serpiginous sores. Syphilitic Boils of an indolent character, but painful, and discharging a thin ichorous pus, vdth a core of shreddy areolar tissue, and leaAing deep, irregular, and foul ulcers, are not uncommonly met Avith. Syphilitic Ulcers may result from pustules, tubercles, or boils, or may ■commence as tertiary sores; they fr'equently occur where the integuments ■are thin, or Avhere they are moistened by the natinal secretions of the part. They are circidar with elevated edges, and tend to spread in circles, Avith a foul greyish sin-face ; often creeping along slowly, and destroying deeply the parts they affect ; leaving cicatrices of a blueish or brown colour, thin ■and smooth, which are apt to break open again on the appheation of any slight in’itation. The Hair and Nails are commoifly affected in advanced constitutional syphilis ; baldness, constituting SyphUitic Aloyoecia, occiuTing either generally ■or in patches, AAuthout any apparent disease of the skin. Disease of the nails, Syj}Mlitic Onychia, occin-s in two forms, either as a foul ulceration between the toes, or else as a chronic inflammation, Avith fmtid discharge in the matrix of the nail; AA'hich becomes black, more or less bent, and scales off Avith the foi- mation of a dirty ulcer under its detached edge. The Treaiment of Cutaneous Syphilis must be conducted in accordance Avith the general principles already laid doAvn, and with special reference to the characters of the concomitant constitutional condition, or of the other local manifestations accompanying it. In the early stages, Avhen ushere in -ly febrile disturbance, a mild antiphlogistic treatment is inquired ; when the pyrexia has been subdued, more specific measures must be had recourse to. In the roseolar forms, the treatment of the secondary aftection should be o-uided by the previous management of the primary sore. If mercniy laACWARTS, EXCRESCEXCES, AND VEGETATIONS. 863 been for this, we should content ourselves with the iodide of potassium ill infusion of cpiassia, or, what is better, in full quantities of the compound decoction of sarsaparilla. Should inerciuy not have been given for the primary sore, recourse must now be had to it. In the squamous syidiilide, mercury, I think, is always necessary ; and here I give the preference to the iodide o\’er the other preparations. In the qnistukt)- forms, syphilitic rupia and ecthyma, the constitution being commonly shattered, a tonic plan of treatment is required in the first instance ; after Avhich the perchloride of meremy in tincture of bark or decoction of sarsaparilla should be steadily administered. In these cases also much benefit Anil be derived from the mercurial fume- bath. In the tulercular syphilide much the same treatment is required as in the last variety ; in these cases, however, I have often found Donovan’s solu- tion of the greatest possible value, the disease rapidly disappearing under its use ; the same plan is required in the management of syphilitic l)oils. In the treatment of secondary syphilitic idcers, Ave shall find it necessary to use caustic freely, with the vicAV of setting up a new and more healthy action in the part. For this pm-pose nitric acid, or the acid nitrate of mercuiy, is especially serviceable ; on the separation of the slough thus produced, the sore may be dressed AAuth red precipitate powder or ointment, or the black Avash, to which, if there be irritation, opium may be added—the same consti- tutional treatment, especially Donovan’s, solution, being employed. Iodoform and paste of iodide of starch are valuable applications in the dirty-looking sloughing ulcers of syphilis. After a fcAV applications, the ulcers become clean and healthy, and speedily heal. In syphilitic alojjecia, the internal administra- tion of perchloride of mercury with bark or iron, and the external use of a strong stimulant, such as the nitrate of merciuy ointment or tincture of can- thai’ides, will be found most serviceable ; and in syphilitic onychia, the fr’ee application of nitrate of silver, followed by the black wash, and lAerchloride of mercury or Donovan’s solution internally, is the proper treatment. 2. Warts, Excrescences, and Vegetations are commonly met with in constitutional syphilis, especially in the neighboiuhood of the mucous canals, being usually situated in the neighbourhood of the anus, periuesum, or scrotiun ; and in the female, upon and Avithin the labia. They are also very frequently met Avith about the tongue, on the tonsils, palate, and Iqjs. "When occurang m the neighbomhood of the org-ans of generation, they are usually large, flat, soft, slightly elevated, and uniform in structure and appearance, moistened AA'ith a good deal of mucous exudation, and a sort of perspirable secretion of the neighbouring skin. When seated in the mouth or throat they are usually small, and not so distinctly elevated or circumscribed, but look rather like a thickened and opaque condition of the mucous membrane in these situations. These secondary Avarts, or Tuherchs as they are often termed, differ essentially from the primary vegetations, not onlv m their appearance and general uniform character, but in being dependent on e constitutional nature of the disease, and not on local causes solely, such as the iiTitation of discharges and the want of cleanliness. They are also cer tamly contagious ; and I have knoAni many instances in which they have been istinctly transmitted in this way ; and, indeed, it is by and tliTOii<.-h them at secondary syphilis is transmitted from one individual to anotheiCArithout864 VENEREAL DISEASES. the evidence of an antecedent primary sore. Their Treatment must he con- stitutional as Avell as local; the constitutional means should consist in the administration of the perchloride of mercury with sarsaparilla ; and tlic best local treatment with which I am acquainted is to rub them freely with the nitrate of silver, dressing the parts in the mterval of the application with chlorinated lotions. Not being pendulous or distinctly protuberant, they do not, like the primary excrescences, require excision. ?). The Mucous Membranes of the Mouth, Nose, Pharynx, and Larynx, arc commonly affected with secondary syphilitic eruptions Avhich assume the form of mucous tubercles, or of the exanthematous, tubercular, and ulcera- tive syphilides. The exanthematous affection, corresponding to the roseolar form of cutaneous syphilis, and arising from the same cause and in the same constitution, principally affects the palate and throat. The tulercidar variety coiTesponds to the squamous cutaneous eruptions, and is chiefly met vdth as flat, hard, and elevated tubercles in the interior of the mouth, nose, and throat. The ulcerative affection of the mucous membranes assumes a variety of forms, which will immediately be described, and occurs princi- pally in the throat and nose. The exanthematous affection of the mucous membrane is usually an early sign of constitutional syphilis, frequently show- ing itself a few weeks after the primary occurx’ence of the disease. The other varieties belong to the more advanced secondary or tertiary pei-iods. The syphilitic affections of the mucous membranes so readily extend to, and are so commonly associated with, corresponding disease of the deeper structm’es, that we shall more conveniently consider their different forms according as they affect distinct organs or parts of the body. The Liy)s are connaonly affected in persons laboming under squamous syphilide, with fissiu’es or cracks usually somewhat indurated, and very painful in the movement of these parts. In the Treatment, the application of a pointed piece of nitrate of silver to the bottom of the crack null give the most effectual relief. The insides of the cheeks are not unfreqnently affected in a similar manner, or become the seat of mucous tubercles, which must be treated as has already been stated. The Tongue may be affected with syphilis in various forms ; when severely, its disease usually constitutes one of the tertiary varieties of the affection. In many cases the mucous membrane becomes thickened, but preseiwes a peculiar o'lossy, semi-transparent, almost gelatinous appearance, and, being iriegulaily fissin’ed, gives the organ a thick and misshapen look. In other instances, the enitheliinn is dry, white, and opaque in patches; the surface of the tongue lookin"’ as if it had been dyed white here and there. Occasionally, ulcers form imon its surface or sides ; these are usually iiTegular in shape, with a foul sin-face and a good deal of siUTOunding induration, and, unless cai'e be taken may readily be confounded vdth scirrhous or cpithelia,! cancer of the or«an The diagnosis of these affections we shall consider when speaking of diieasls of the tongue genei-allj.

These various diseases usually indicate aSYPHILITIC DISEASES OF THE LARYNX. 865 dcci)ly seated constitutional affection of the tertiary type. But some of the most obstinate cases that I have met with appeared to liave originated from direct contact of the tongue with the same organ in another person the subject of tertiary lingual syidiilis, and thus from direct contamination. The Treatment consists in the administration of mercury, in the form either of iodide or of perchloride. Donovan’s solution is extremely useful in many of the more inveterate of these cases. The ulcers should be touched from time to time with the nitrate of silver. The syphilitic diseases of the Throat are amongst the most common manifes- tations of constitutional syphilis, and frequently occur early. They present several distinct foinis, coiTCsponding to analogous primary and secondary cutaneous affections. One of the earliest conditions is a deep-red exanthe- matous efflorescence of the soft palate and the pillars of the fauces, either without ulceration, or mth but superficial abrasion, but with much cachexy and depression of power, and perhaps with considerable pyrexia. It often occims about the period of the uivasion of the roseolar or rupial syphilide, and requires the same Treatment as is necessary in these affections, together with the local application of a strong solution of the nitrate of silver. A deep exca- vated ulcer, with a hard base and foul greyish surface, of circular or OA’al.form, is not uufrequently met with on one or the other tonsil; it corresponds to that class of secondary phenomena that follows the indurated chancre, and recjuires merciuy in some form for its cm-e ; in this and many other cases, the mineral may most conveniently be apphed to the throat by means of fumigation. A sloughing ulcer is occasionally seen on the side of the throat or palate, with much swelling, a foul grey surface, and rapid destruction of parts, giving rise A'ery commonly to perforation of the soft palate, and thus, by partially destroy- ing the ciu’taui between the mouth and the nose, occasioning serious inconve- nience to the patient during deglutition and in speech. This form of ulcer is connected with the rupial or ecthymatous syphilides, and requires the same constitutional Treatment as these. The best local plan is free sponging with strong nitric acid, and gargling with solutions of the chlorides. More rarely a foim of the serpiginous ulceration is met with, producing considerable contrac- tion and inconvenient consolidation of tissues after its cure. It is, I think, best treated by the local application of nitric acid, and the internal administra- tion of perchloride of merciuy. The mucous membrane of the Larynx is not unfr’equently affected both in early and in advanced syphilis. Dining the period of the scaly eruptions 011 the skin, and excoriation of the fauces, the larynx is attacked by catarrhal inflammation and by the formation of flat slightly elevated papules, similar to those seen on other parts of the body. The symptoms are hoarseness and loss of voice, and occasionally cough. They usually subside without leaving any permanent injury. In these .cases, chronic inflammation, with thickening and ulceratio]!, takes place about the rima glottidis, with the general and local .s}Tnptoms of chronic laryngitis ; such as huskincss of voice, cough, and expec- toration of tenacious or offensive mucus ; a difficulty in degiutition, and a tendency to choking on swallowing liquids, with tenderness on pressure about the throat, also come on. These cases arc usually accompanied by much constitutional cachexy, and not unfr-equently terminate fatally by the von. I. 3 KVENEREAL DIBEARER. 866 sudden supervention of oedema glottidis. Tlie ConsUlHiioma Trealment must depend upon the concomitant symptoms and tlie general state of the patient; most commonly tonics will be rccpiircd. The Local Aleans consist in the free application of the solution of the nitrate of silver to the i-ima glottidis, and the occasional employment of counter-iiTitation. In syphilitic ulceration occuiTing’ about the sides or base of the epiglottis, care must be taken in the application of the stronger escharotics, such as iritric acid or the acid nitrate of mercury ; as a small quantity of these, if inhaled into the larynx, might produce serious difficulty in breathing, or even fatal asphyxia. In many cases it may become necessary to open the windpipe, in order to prevent death from asphyxia ; this must be done in accordance with the rules that will be laid dowi Avhen treating: of Chi’onic Laryngitis. The Nose is commonly affected in constitutional syiffiilis, and often destruc- tively so, especially in individuals much exposed to changes of temperature, and who are imable to pay proper attention to their treatment. The mucous membrane becomes chronically thickened, with discharge of blood and pus, coryza, and habitual snuffiing. In other cases ulceration takes place, with a very fetid odour of the breath, and the formation of thick ecthymatous crusts on the septum, or between this and the alee. This ulceration is very persistent and troublesome, and requires usually a mercurial treatment with the local application of strong nitric acid, or of the acid nitrate of mercury, to arrest its progress. In many cases ulceration will rapidly proceed to destruction and perforation of the septum, or necrosis of the spongy bones, the vomer, and ethmoid ; sometimes excavating the whole of the interior of the nose, scooping and cleaning it out into one vast chasm. When this happens, the nasal bones also are usually flattened, broken down, and destroyed ; the alte and columna ulcerating away, and producing vast disfigurement. Occasionally the disease extends to the bones of the base of the skull, and in this way may occasion impairment of vision, epilepsy, or death. The Trealment of these nasal affec- tions must be conducted in accordance with general principles. In many cases mercurial fumigation is extremely useful; in others, where the disease is ulcerative, the strong acid and caustic applications already mentioned, vdth chlorinated solutions occasionally sniffed up, will do much to stop its progress. As necrosis occius, the dead bone must be removed. 4. Syphilitic Iritis usually occurs after exposure to cold, and often in people who are otherwise strong and healthy. The ordinaiy symptoms of iritis, somewhat modified, characterise the affection. The patient complains of dim- ness of sight, pain in the eye, and often of very severe circumorbital or hemi- cranial pains.- On examining the eye, the conjunctiva will be found to be slightly injected, and a zone of pink vessels to be seated on the sclerotic, close to'^tbe cornea ; the aqueous humom’ has lost its transparency, giving a muddy look to the eye, and the coloiu of the iris is altered. The pupil is diminished in size and irregular in shape, usually angular towards the nasal side, and small yellowish or brownish nodules of lymph may be seen to be deposited on the siuface of the iris. If the case be left to itself, or be improperly treated it will advance to disorganisation of the globe, and to permanent loss of sight. The retina often becomes affected, and incurable blindness results. The Trealment consists in local depletion by means of cupping and leechesSYPHILITIC DISEASE OF BONES. 867 to the temples, and the administration of calomel and opium internally, at the same time that a strong solution of atropine is put frequently into the eye. Most commonly, as the mouth becomes aflected by the mercurial, the eye uall clear, the lymph becoming absorbed, and the pupil regaining its normal shape and colour. In some cases, however, a chronic inflammation continues ; here the best efiects result from the administration of small doses of perchloride of mercury, with repeated blistering to the temples ; and, in a later stage, soda and bark may be advantageously given. T). Syphilitic Periostitis or Nodes may occur on almost any of the bones ; but the disease is most commonly met with on the tibia, the clavicle, or the bones of the forearm. Some joints are also not unfrequently affected by it ; the sterno-clavicular articulation and the knee-joint are especially often its seats. Nodes are indolent, elongated, uniform, and hard swellings, sometimes tender on pressiue, and generally but little painful dming the day; but at night the aggravation of pain is peculiarly marked, and constitutes perhaps the most distressing symptom. They consist of a thickening of the periosteum, mth some plastic effusion within and rmdemeath it, and occasional thickening of the subjacent bone ; they may continue permanently or may terminate by resolution ; they never suppurate, unless there be disease of the subjacent bone. The Treatment consists, if there be much tenderness, in the application of leeches ; if there be no great sensibility on pressiue, but considerable nocturnal pain, blisters should be applied. When the nodes are in a chronic state, the tinctiue of iodine is an useful application. Nodes sometimes become soft and prominent, and feel semi-fluctuating, especially when seated on the cranium, so as almost to tempt the Surgeon to make an opening into them ; this, how- ever, shoidd never be done, as the swelling, however great, will subside under proper treatment. For the ultimate removal of the tumour, and the relief of the nocturnal pains, we possess an excellent and sure remedy in the iodide of potassium, earned to large doses. Other flbrous membranes besides the periosteum may become diseased, and masses of dense lymph, in the form of warty tumours, excrescences, or nodes, may be deposited upon them as the consequence of the syphilitic inflamma- tion. This is particularly the case with the dura mater of the brain and cord. As one of the ulterior effects of tertiary syphilis, structural changes of this kind may take place in and upon the diua mater of the brain, giving rise to hemiplegia and epileptiform seizures, and eventually coma and death, partly from pressure, partly fi-om initation. If the cliua mater of the cord be affected by nodes, more or less complete paraplegia 'will result. 6. Diseases of the Bones are amongst the more remote and severe effects of constitutional syphilis, when it has reached the tertiary stage. By some Surgeons they are said to be the result of the administration of mercury, rather than ot the syphilis for which the mineral is given. This doctrine I believe to be entirely without foundation. That they are met with in syphilitic cases m which no mercury has been given, there can be no doubt. 1 have had under my care patients with extensive disease of the cranium and ot the clavicle, whose syphilis had been treated from first to last on the non-mcrcurial plaft. One patient especially, a soldier, from whom I removed 3 K 2VENEREAL BIREASEE. 68 fv portion of the cranium and of the clavicle for necrosis accompanying consti- tutional syphilis, had been treated in a military hospital wthout mercury. I have never seen or hoard of mercury producing necrosis in any bones, except those of the jaws, when given for other diseases than syphilis. No doubt diseases of the hones are especially apt to occur when the patient’s constitution has been broken down by any means ; and an improperly conducted mercurial coiu’se may have this result. They usually occur after the patient has passed thi-ough the whole coiu’se of the less severe syphilitic affections, such as those of the skin, mucous membrane, and throat. The aff’ections of the hones, however, may in some cases declare themselves at the same time with the affections of the skin and mucous membranes. They more commonly occur amongst the poorer classes, especially those who are exposed to atmospheric vicissitudes, and chiefly in strumous constitutions. The syphihtic affections are principally met Avith in those bones that are flat and compact, as the cranial, nasal, and maxiUary bones. In these, various forms of disease occm-. One of the most common is perhaps Chronic Ostitis, with hypertrophy and condensation of the osseous tissues, often to a very marked extent. This affection may occur in the bones of the skuU, but is also met with in some of the long bones, as the tibia and the ulna ; it is characterised by very severe pam, especially of a noctm-nal character, accom- panying the enlarged and thickened state of the bone. Syphilitic Necrosis chiefly ocem’s in the bones of the skuU and jaws, the alveolar processes of which may exfoliate ; the palatine proeess of the supe- rior maxillary bone, the spongy and the nasal bones, are also commonly destroyed by this morbid action ; but it is a remarkable fact that the palate- bones are not nearly so often affected as the nasal and spongy bones. In consequence of this destruction of bony tissue, the interior of the nose becomes chronically diseased, and the organ may fall in, or a eommunication may be estabhshed between the nose and the mouth through the hard palate. Syphilitic Caries, or ulceration of bone, presents different forms, whieh, ■according to Stanley, correspond to analogous ulcers and eruptions of the skin. Thus, there may be the simple ulcer of the bone, showing a rough, in-ec^idar, porous, and depressed surface ; the worm-eaten caries, consisting of smaU pits or excavations, studding the sm-face ; and the seryiyinous ox creepiny nicer, marked by imperfect attempts at repair, and the deposition of new bone in nodules or masses. The cranial bones are those that are most commonly .affected in this way ; and their disease may sometimes prove fatal by the diTitation set up by it in the brain or its membranes. The bones of the extremities, however, are not iinfrequently similarly affected. pecuhar dry caries of the cancellous striictm’e of the old svnhihtic cases. In both cases, which were verySYPHILITIC DISEASE OF THE TESTICLE. 869 The Treatment of syphilitic disease of bone varies somewhat, according to the form which it assumes, and the pre\-ious management of the patient. In ostitis, the principal reliance should be placed upon the conjoined influence of calomel and opium, provided the patient have not previously been fully mer- curialised. If he have been so, we must rely chiefly upon iodide of potassium. In the more advanced and intractable cases that have resisted all treatment, I have foimd the gi-eatest advantage result from cutting down upon the enlarged, thickened, and tender bone, and by means of a Hey’s saw making a deep cut into it about one and a half or two inches in length parallel to its axis, and do\vn to the medullary canal. By this operation the tension is at once relieved, and the pain effectually and permanently removed. In syphilitic necrosis, the constitutional cachexy demands the piincipal share of attention ; the necrosed bone should be separated as it becomes loose, the local irritation depending on its presence then subsiding. When the bone has fallen into a carious state, iodide of potassium in combination with iron, cod-hver oil, or sarsaparilla, with the mineral acids, vdll improve the tone of the system, and stay the pro- gress of the disease. The ulcerated and exposed bone requires to be dressed with strong stimulants ; the red oxide of mercury, in ointment or powder, is perhaps the best; in some cases, touching the part freely with the acid nitrate of mercury will establish a more healthy action. 7. Besides these various constitutional manifestations of syphihs, tumours of the Muscles and Tendons, depending on this disease, have been described by Bouisson. These consist of nodules of yellow gummy matter, like those described as occuring in the testis ; they form between the muscular fibres from the coimective tissue. The muscles are also often contracted by tough adhesions of the sheaths and insertions through slow inflammation and thickening of the fibrous tissue. When affecting the tendons, these tumours are elongated, and resemble nodes upon them. Their presence is attended with some pain during the contraction of the muscle ; they are usually somewhat globular, and vary in size from a nut to a pigeon’s egg, being accompanied by noctiu’nal pains. They are best treated by the iodide of potassium in large doses. 8. Syphilitic Disease of the Testicle is one of the more advanced con- ditions of the constitutional affection. It commonly occurs as the result of that train of symptoms that consist mainly of squamous affections of the skin, the excavated ulcer of the throat, iritis, and nodes, but usually it does not appear until these different manifestations of constitutional syphilis have, each in its turn, passed away ; the patient, indeed, appearing to have recovered from all disease, and being otherwise in good health. Commonly the exciting cause of the disease may be a blow, a squeeze, the occurrence of gonorrheal epididymitis, or some other local cause. The testis then gradually enlarges, until it attains the size of a tiukey’s egg, or even larger, being ovoid in shape, hea^7, and smooth, not painful except by its weight, which causes dragging and uneasy sensations in the cord and loins. This disease is very commonly accompanied by a small hydrocele, constituting, indeed, a hydro-sarcocele. Most frequently only one testis is affected ; very rarely both are diseased. The affec- tion continues to increase, giving rise to uneasiness from its size and weight, Imt IS not followed by suppuration or other inconvenience.8yo VENEUEiiL EI8EASES. Iliiiiiilton of Dublin has described another form of syphilitic sarcocele, under the term, tubercular sy|)hilitic sarcocele.” In this the testis is enlarged to three oi four times its natural bulk, of an irregular shape, presenting an uneven, hard, and knotty mass ; it is neither painful nor tender, but incon- venient from its weight, causing pains in the loins and cord. Both testes are usually affected, but one is worse than the other ; and when the disorganisa- tion is gi-eat, Hamilton states that all sexual desire is lost, and that neither erections nor emissions take place ; both, however, returning as the treatment effects the restoration of the organ to its normal condition. In these cases suppiu’ation not unfrequently takes place, followed by the discharge of thin pus, the formation of fistulous openings, and occasionally the protrusion of a fungus. This form of sarcocele ocem-s in persons of a broken and cachectic constitution, who are suffering severely from the more advanced and inveterate forms of tertiary syphilis, especially of the bones and throat. In the simple syphilitic sarcocele, the enlargement of the testis is principally due to the deposit of semitransparent white or yellow lymph, in an uniform manner, throughout the substance of the organ external to the tubuli. In the tubercular syphilitic sarcocele, Hamilton states that tubercles of a yellow colour, and varying in size from a split pea to a chestnut, or even larger, are found in the substance of the organ ; these, softening, give rise to suppuration in and around them, and thus to the ultimate disorganisation of the testis, which becomes converted into a hard irregular fibro-ceUular mass, in which cretaceous matter is occasionally deposited. In the Treatment of the simple form of sarcocele, a full mercurial coin-se is generally necessary ; the perchloride, in doses of the twelfth or eighth of a grain three times a day, is the best preparation. This should be continued for at least six or eight Aveeks, or until hardness disappears. Any hydrocele that exists should be tapped, and the fluid drawn off by means of a small trochar and cannula before the treatment is commenced. After the mercury has been discontinued, the remaining SAA'eUing of the testis may be remoA’ed by the internal administration of iodide of potassium in five-grain doses, twice or thrice daily, with frictions with the iodide of lead ointment. In these cases, care should be taken not to irritate the scrotum with very stimulating apphea- tions, as the skin is tender, and readily becomes excoriated; ordinary strapping is of very little use, but in some cases I have found strapping with the plaster of ammoniacum and mercury, diluted with equal parts of belladonna plaste? of serA'ice. If suppuration occur, and a fungus protrude, the same treatment must be adopted as Avill be described in speaking of the strumous testicle. 9. Syphilitic Ovaritis is a disease that I believe I have on several occa- sions met Avith. The history of the cases has been uniformly as follows: a long antecedent attack of syphilis ; various constitutional symptoms rmmmg thi'ough secondary and tertiary stages ; inflammatory congestion of one ovary, as determined by abdominal and rectal exploration; eventual cure by means of leeching and the perchloride of mercury and bark ; in fact, a con ition o things closely resembling Avhat occurs in syphilitic sarcocele. ^ 10 Visceral Sjrphilis.—Our knoAvledge of the syphilitic diseases of the internal organs is of modern origin, and still someAvhat imperfect. “ ^hkceral Syphihs ” Avas not only unknoAvn to, but imsiispected by, so acute an observeiVISCERAL SYPHILIS. 871 as Tolm Hunter, and the syphilographors of the early part of this century make no mention of it. To Dittrich, Lanccreaux, AVilks, Bristowe, and Moxon we arc indebted to the establishment of the fact that, after external manifesta- tions of syphilis have in a great measure, if not entirely, disappeared, and the disease has entered its tertiary stage, gummata may form in most, if not m all, the intcnial organs, producing serious functional disturbance, and leading to organic changes of the most extensive, deep-seated, and fatal character. H may now be taken as a fact, incontestably established by niunerons patho- logical observations, that there are few, if any, organs that escape the ravages of*syiihilis ; and although there may be a doubt whether some of the forms of disease met with in certain organs, as the liver, lungs, and spleen, and described us syphilitic, may not in reality be due to non-specific disease, to which, as well as to syphilis, they are common, there can be no doubt of the fact, as Moxon has pointed out, that when gummata are met with in internal organs the fact of the syphilitic nature of the disease is established. In the heart, syiihilitic deposits have been found on the endocardium, less fi'equently in the valves ; and two forms of myo-carditis of syphilitic origin— one circumscribed, the other diffuse—have been described by Lancereaux. The arteries are very apt to undergo syphilitic degeneration, according to the same author, those of the neck and head more especially. But in any portion of the arterial system fibroid deposits of syphilitic origin may be met with, leading by their degeneration to anemlsm. These syphilitic arterial deposits must not be confounded with ordinary atheroma. They may occur either as infiltrations into the coats, or as deposits of semi-opaque plastic matter in the lining membrane of the vessels. The lungs, livei', and spleen are all liable to syphilitic deposits. As a general rule, they may affect two forms—occurring either as gummata or as diffuse interstitial deposit, which in the liver may simulate cin-hosis, and in the lungs some of the forms of “ fibroid phthisis.” These syphilitic visceral diseases not unfrequently rmi a fatal com-se : rarely, however, destroying the patient before the age of 3o (Wilks). The diagnosis of the specific nature of the affection must always be open to doubt, except in those cases in which the history of the infection has been continuous, and some of the more superficial and easily recognisable syphilitic affections are associated with the visceral forms of the disease. So fin as treatment is concerned, there is little hope from any remedies except the mercurial. 11. There is no more distressing form of syphilitic disease than that which affects the Nervous System. The brain, the spinal cord, and their meninges are all liable to this invasion ; but we have no evidence as yet that the substance or the neurilemma of individual nerves may become the seat of the disease, although that such may be the case is in the highest degree probable. Syphilitic disease of the nervous system may occur at all ages. It is common in young men. I have often seen it under or about the age of 25 to SO. It is the common cause of paralysis in early manhood. The paralytic condition, which is one of its earliest manifestations, is very commonly developed by some slight accident a fall upon or a strain of the back, or by over-exertion in walking, riding, or running. The primary syphilitic disease has often been .slight the sccondaiy symptoms trivial; and indeed, no great importance may^72 VENEREAL BI8EA8EE. have been attached to the venereal infection, until the manifestations of its most terrible and destructive elfects on the brain or cord. The great peculiarity of the nervous affections dependent on syiihilis is that they are irregular, scattered, and do not foUow the ordinary course of the non-specific forms of the disease. They are commonly accompanied by cutaneous sy^jhilides of the low types, such as ecthyma, rupia, or serpiginous sores ; by occasional sloughy throat; by painful nodes on the cranium, verte- bral column, or long bones ; and the final manifestation of the nervous affec- tion is very often preceded by severe pains in the head, down the limbs, or round the body. The disease may declare itself in tAvo forms, separately or conjoined : viz., by paralysis or epilepsy. Syphilitic Pcircilysis chiefly affects the motor nerA'es. The third, fourth, sixth, and seventh are often early affected, giving rise to ptosis, to immobility of the eyeball, or to strabismus, Avith more or less facial palsy and double vision. I have neA'er seen paralysis of the fifth nerve in the disease. Oculo-motor paralysis in some form is, indeed, one of the earliest signs of a syphilitic disease of the brain, and Avhen this occurs in young men it should, hoAvever passing and slight, always attract the most serious attention, as it is usually the precursor of more general paralytic disease. If the patient be hemiplegic, he is only partially so, and the liemiplegic affection is irregular in the intensity of its distribution, in the degree of loss of motor or sensory power in different limbs, and is often spastic. When the spinal cord or its membranes are the seat of the syi)hihtic disease, the lower segment of the cord is usually first or more markedly attacked. Paraplegic symptoms to a limited extent often show themselves. They usually commence in the muscles supplied by the external popliteal nerve, and are often throughout the coiu’se of the disease confined to these, giving rise to drag- ging of the foot, and inability to raise it from the ground, or to timn it outwards. Epileptic Seizures are common in the cerebral form of syphihs. They are often of the most prolonged and violent character, leading to coma. But dangerous as these attacks may become, there is this remarkable point in con- nexion Avith them—that epilej)tic seizimes of the gravest possible character, if syphilitic in their origin, may be recovered from, Avhilst attacks of equal seve- rity, if non-specific, Avould certainly have a fatal termination. After these epileptic attacks the patient often improves materially, some of his paralytic symptoms, such as ptosis or strabismus, being ameliorated or even passing away entirely. In other cases, again, the mental powers undergo gradual deteriora- tion, delusions perhaps manifest themselves, and the patient falls into a state of semi-imbecility. There is truly not a more pitiable object to be seen than a man, young or in the prime of life, suffering from syphihtic disease of the nervous centres— affected by ptosis—AAoth one eye staring and immovable or squintizig, the face distorted, the lip dropped and saliva dribbling, defecth'e in his articulation, straddhng and insecure in his Avalk, di'agging one leg behind him. At times the Adctim of the most fi’ightful epileptic paroxysms, often coA'ered by rupial sores, he is truly a fit object for commiseration rather than one for reprobation and reproach.873 INFANTILE SYPHILIS. Ill sypliiloimi of the brain, post mortem examination usually reveals gummata ivith sottened cerebral tissue around, adherent and opaque membranes, and degenerated eerebral arteries. In the cord, syphiloma appears in the form of sniaU scattered gummata, usually about the size of barley-corns. In one case (Wilks) the deposit was as large as a nut. These deposits have chiefly been met with in the lower half of the cord. The membranes may be thickened by gelatinous deposits, adherent and injected. In the Treatment of these cases, if not too far advanced, there is fortunately much to be done for the patient’s relief, if not complete cure. Mercurials in some shape—more especially the perchloride or the green iodide—if not pre- viously fully used, should have a fair trial given. The iodide of potassium in gradually increasing doses should be given, especially in those cases in which mercury has been fuUy employed or in which there is much periosteal thicken- ing and tenderness. In such cases also, counter-irritation by means of blisters and setons will be found usefid. And lastly, the epileptic paroxysms may be controlled by means of the bromides of potassiiun or of ammonium. But it must be evident that, when once the affection of the nervous centres has developed gummata of large size, no treatment can be of much avail, and destructive dis- organisation of the substance of the brain or cord must eventually result. INFANTILE SYPHILIS. Chaxckes on the labia of the mother may possibly infect the child at birth with either of the two forms of venereal disease that have been described, just as they may inoculate the hand of the accoucheur ; but syphilis thus contracted by the infant is not the form of the disease that is described as Infantile Syphilis. This is a truly hereditary infection, transmitted to the infant at the time of its conception, or communicated to it through the medium of the mother dm’ing intra-uterine life, and existing as a constitu- tional affection at the time of its birth. Though we may believe that syphihs is not easily eradicated fi’om a system into w^hich it has once been received, and that under certain conditions it may readily be transmitted to the offspring ; yet I think that we are still ignorant of the amount and natm’e of the consti- tutional affection of the parents that are necessary for the development of syphilis in their children, and that we are certainly not waiTanted in conclud- ing that a parent who has been, or even who is actually affected by constitu- tional syphilis, must necessarily have a syphilitic, or even a feeble and strumous family ; although the probability undoubtedly is that the offspring wuU be syphilitic. I have had under my observation a gentleman whom I had attended for secondary sjqihilis, and who, contraiy to my adAuce, married some years ago ; and, though he has since then suffered from psoriasis of the hands, mucous tubercles. Assures on the lips and tongue, and venereal sarcocele, yet his wife has borne a perfectly healthy family, not only Avithout any syphilitic taint, but Avithout any apparent constitutional cachexy. When the oviuii is infected Avith syiihilis, several morbid states may result, according to the inteusity of the infection. It may be so blighted that it never reaches the maturity of intra-uterine life, but becomes early aborted ; in this way many consecutive miscarriages may happen in consequence of one orVENEREAL BI8EAEEH. S74 botli of the parents having constitutional syphilis ; hut, if they he put under j)iopei tieatnient hy a mercurial course, and the disease he thus eradicated lioin the system, the o\’um will at the next pregnancy probably reach its full <le^'elopment. Gestation may go its full time, and the fcctus he horn with syphilitic cachexy and local manifestations of the disease fully developed upon it. More frecpiently, however, the child, although cachectic and sickly looking, is brought into the world without any syphilitic appearances ; hut in the course of a few weeks, usually from the third to the eighth, these declare themselves. Constitutional syphilis of a congenital nature may manifest itself even at the adult age. This, though rare, has fallen under my observation in a young woman aged seventeen who was covered Avith marked syphilitic psoriasis, Avith Avhich she had been affected for seAmal years. The mother told me that, shortly after birth, evidences of infantile syphilis had appeared; that these had yielded to treatment, but that, as the period of puberty approached, the psoriasis, which was truly of a sj^Dhilitic nature, had shoAra itself. In other cases, again, it is not impossible that the syphilitic taint may manifest itself in a different way from that which has just been alluded to ; that no local manifestation may occiu’, but that an impaired and depraved state of constitution and of nutritiA^e actiA’ity may be inherited, Avhich, in after-life, o'iA'cs rise to some of the various forms of scrofula or of other constitutional disease, dependent upon an enfeebled state of system, or a diminution, as it were, of the general vitality. Mode of Communication.—The mode of communication of syphilis to the ovum, or to the in utero foetus, is an investigation that has much occupied the attention of Surgeons, and is of considerable practical interest. It has been considered probable, that the poison may be communicated to the embryo in at least foim ways : viz., 1, the father may have a constitutional taint of which he has been imperfectly cured, and, Avithout communicating any syphilitic disease to his AAufe, may be the parent of an offspring that exhibits indications of being infected ; or, 2, the mother, haAung a similar constitutional disease, may in like manner taint her own offspring ; or, 3, the diseased child may be born of parents, both of whom are constitutionally infected ; or, 4, the mother may become preguiant with a healthy embryo, but, afterwards, contracting syphilis, may transmit it to her offspring. There are very good reasons for believing that the disease does not pass from the father to the child Avithout also implicating the mother. In the first place, this faculty is shared by no other contagious disease. No father can give his offspring small-pox, though the mother fi’equently communicates that disease to her foetus. In the next place, it is well known, as Colles of Dublin long ago pointed out, that a congenitally syphilitic child never locally infects its mother, though it will transmit its disease readily to a Avet-nurse, Avhose breast it sucks ; this apparent exemption of the mother being due to the fact that she has been akeady infected. Again, the symptoms of syphilis are often exceedingly mild in Avomen, and constantly overlooked. Hence, in t le piescn state of our knoAvledge, it is safer to conclude that the father infects the mother, and that she transmits her disease to the offspring. Ricord, however, states that a mother, pregnant with a syiihihtic foetus, the offspring of a father labouring under constitutional disease, can be infectedSYMPTOMS OF INFANTILE SYPHILIS. 875 through it without herself ha^-iiig had primary syidulis ; and Jonathan Hutchinson has advanced a considerable amount of evidence m support ol this doctrine, which, nevertheless, fails to cany conviction to my mind that such communication ever takes place. Then, again, there is no doubt that a wet-nm-se labouring under constitutional syphilis can infect the child that she suckles, the infant being contaminated through the medium of the milk. Ricord, and many others of equal authority, admit this. My owm opinion is that sjqihilis is, though rarely, so transmitted ; and, indeed, there are a number of cases on record in proof of this {vide RanMmf s Abstract, vol. iv.). The converse of this is also a matter beyond dispute : a syphilitic child can infect a healthy nm-se. This point is one of very great importance, inas- much as actions for damages have been brought by women who have stated that they have become diseased from the child that they have nursed. There are cases recorded that prove it incontestably ; and, on such a question as this, one positive fact must necessarily outweigh any amount of negative eHdence. Not only have Hunter and Lawrence related cases in which an infected child communicated the disease to several nurses in succession ; in Himter’s cases three wet-nurses were successively infected, two of whom gave the disease again to their own cliildren ; but a considerable mass of evidence upon this point is to be found in Ranking's Abstract {loc. cit). The disease is especially apt to be communicated in this Avay, if the iiiu'se have any crack or abrasion upon her nipple, and the infant sores on the mouth. CoUes, however, who had great experience in syphilis, states that the disease may be communicated to the nurse from an infected child, by mere contact, Avithout excoriation. Symptoms.—The symptoms of infantile syphilis are sufficiently well marked : consisting principally of cachexy, with disease of the mucous and cutaneous surfaces. The first indication is usually the atrophic and cacliectic appearance of the child ; this not unfrequently shows itself at birth, and Avhen it does so, such children are often small, shrivelled, wan, and wasted, when born ; the face especially has an aged look, the features being pinched, and the flesh soft and flabby; the complexion generally has a yelloAvish or earthy tinge ; and these characters continue until the disease is eradicated from the system of the child. But it is more usual for the disease to delay its appearance imtil a month has elapsed after birth. Diday and De M6ric have collected a large number of cases, in most of which the disease was developed in the fifth and sixth w^eeks. Many betrayed their disorder in the first month ; in some few it was delayed until the child had attained the age of three months. The earlier the disease shows itself, the more fatal are its effects. Children who are not attacked till they are tAvo or three months old, usually recover their health in a short time. Nor, Avhen the child is born Avith syjffiilitic eruptions, is it ahvays atrophic and ill-nourished, though such a condition is the ordinary one. The first local sign that declares itself is usually a congestive condition of the mucous membrane of the nose, giving rise to the secretion of offensive mucus, and causing the child to make a peculiar snuffling noise in breathing, as if it had a chronic catarrh ; this snuffling may exist from the time of birth, but generally comes on A^ery shortly afterwards. The mucous membrane of the876 VENEREAL DISEASES. mouth is also liable to attacks of inflammation, and this syphilitic stomaiiMs is a very marked characteristic of the disease. The disease manifests itself upon the cutaneous and mucous surfaces, some- times before or at birth, in other cases not until several weeks have elapsed. The most common period for the occim-ence of these signs is the third or fourth week. Ihe cutaneous eruption usually makes its appearance on the nates, the scrotum, the soles of the feet, and around the mouth ; hence, in examining a syi^hilitic child, these parts should always be looked at first. It presents itself in three difierent foi’ms : most frequently as flat tubercles, varying in size from a split pea to a fourpenny-piece, smooth, slightly elevated, and of a coppery or reddish-brown colour. These tubercles are often accompanied by cracks and fissm'es about the mouth and anus. Though commonly called squamous, they are not in reality scaly, but are always smooth and flat. Intermixed with these are brownish muculse or spots, differing in size, and variously figured. The vesicular or bullous eruption is not so common as those just described, yet I have frequently seen it in syphilitic children. It appears in the form of vesicles, about the size of a split pea, with a dusky coppery areola and base ; drying into browm scales or scabs, and commonly conjoined with the tubercular affection. These bullae are most frequently seen on the soles of the feet. When we consider the influence exercised by the syphibtic poison upon the skin, and its appendages the hair and nails, we should d priori have expected that the teeth, as a portion of the dermal skeleton, would participate! in the morbid action induced by it on the allied structures. The fact of their doing so does not, however, appear to have attracted the notice of any observer, imtil J. Hutchinson directed the attention of the profession to this very interesting subject, and pointed out the destructive and special influence exercised upon the teeth by secondary constitutional syphilis. This injurious influence mani- fests itself both in the temporary and in the permanent teeth ; but only with its specific and peculiar characteristics in the permanent set. It must not however, be supposed that in all cases of in- fantile syphihs the teeth are affected ; indeed, in many instances they are not, and it has been particularly pointed out by J. Hutchin- son that it is only when there have been attacks of syphihtic stomatitis, that we are to expect to meet with these changes in the teeth from their normal types. The temporary teeth of syphihtic infants are cut early, are of bad colom*, and hable to a crumbling decay (Fig. 319). The upper cen- tral incisors usually suffer early, and always first ; then the laterals become carious and ch'op out; and lastly, in some cases, though rarely, the canines wear away so as to present a tusk-hke appearance. In consequence of the eai’ly decay of the incisors, children are often edentulous, so far as these teeth are concerned, fr’om an early age, imtil the permanent ones are cut. The permanent teeth present the more marked characteristics of an inherited Fig. 319.—Syaliilitio Temiwmiy Teeth.877 Fig. 320.—Two Central Syphilitic Incisors Deeply Notched (Hutchinson). Fig. 321.—One Central Incisor Notched (Hutchinson). treatment of syphilis in infants SYpbilitic taint ; and in these, as in the temporary, the disease declares itself chiefly in the incisors of the upper jaw, and first in the central ones, ihese will be observed to be usually of a bad colom-, short, pegg}', rounded at the angles, standing apart with interspaces, or converging, and marked by a deep broad notch; They arc soft and crumbling, ai’c slender, and readily wear down (Figs. 820, 321). Besides the notching, the sides of the teeth are curved inwards towards one another, and thus the cutting edge becomes narrower than the crown. The teeth are also shorter than the others. The convergence of the sides causes the teeth to be somewhat separated, and to stand apart. Under the name of Chronic Interstitial Keratitis, J. Hutchinson has described a disease which he believes to be uniformly due to hereditary syphilis. It occui’s between the ages of 5 and 18, but may occim much earlier, even dm-ing the first year. It consists at first of a hazy condition of the cornea, giving it the appearance of gi’ound glass, followed by vascularisation without any tendency to ulceration. The opacity commences in the centre, and both eyes are usually affected. The vascularity is not confined to the surface, but seems to pervade the whole thickness of the cornea. One eye is usually affected before the other. Under a carefully conducted com’se of mercmials and iodides, accompanied by tonics and good diet, the transparency of the cornea can usually be restored. Treatment.—The occurrence of syphilis in the infant may be p-eventecl by putting the infected mother on a mercimial com'se so soon as her pregnancy is ascei-tained ; this indeed may be necessary in order to prevent miscarriage, but should be done cautiously, and by inunction rather than by mercury admin- istered by the mouth. Should repeated miscarriages have occurred, as the consecpience of constitutional syphilis, one or other, or both the parents, if at fault, should be put upon a mercmial course ; and thus the reciu-rence of this accident may be prevented. The Curative Treatment as regards the child is extremely simple. It should be brought up by hand, lest it infect the niu’se or continue to receive fresh accession of poison from the diseased milk of its mother. It must then be pnt under the influence of mercury, which in these cases acts almost as a specific; and, indeed, the ready manner in which all disease may be eradicated from the system of a syphilitic child by this mineral, is perhaps one of the strongest proofs that can be adduced of the specific character of its action on the venereal poison. The mercury may be given by the mouth in the form of small doses of hydrargyrum cum creta ; but, as it often purges the child when administered in this way, Brodie has recommended its introduction into the system by inunction, which process I invariably employ, and have found it a most successful mode of treating the disease. The most convenient plan is, as recommended by Sir Benjamin, to spread a drachm of mercurial ointment on the under part of a flannel roller stitched round the thigh just above the878 VENEREAL DISEASES. knee, and to reneAv this every day. The treatment should be continued for two or three weeks, until all rash and snuffling have disappeared, when the merciuy having been discon^nued, the cure may be perfected by the adminis- tration of small doses of iodide of potassium in milk or cod-liver oil. Occa- sionally the cutaneous manifestations of infantile syphilis are complicated with, and obscured by, some of the common diseases of the skin incident tO' early childhood ; more particularly with eczema impetiginodes of the head, face, and body. In these circumstances, the diagnosis may not be easy, though the history of the case, the concomitant appearance of two forms of the disease, and the existence of snuffling and cachexy, tend to establish it. The eczema also, in these circumstances, is browner and more squamous than usual. In cases such as these, the best plan is to treat the syphihtic affection first with the mercurial inunction, and then to put the child under a mild course of Donovan’s solution, two or three minims for a dose, keeping it at the same time on a good nourishing diet.879. WARTS AND CORNS. DISEASES OF TISSUES. CHAPTER XXXVIL SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. The Tarioiis specific cutaneous affections, such as eczema, scabies, impetigo^ acne, lepra, psoriasis, &c., probably fall -within the province of the Surgeon, and are commonly treated by him in practice ; but, as the consideration of these diseases -would necessarily lead into the -whole subject of Dermatology,, the limits of this -R^ork -would not aUo-w me to discuss so extensive and special a branch of Surgery ; and I must therefore content myself with the considera- tion of some of those affections of the skin, which, as requiring manual assistance, may perhaps be more properly looked upon as within the scope- of the present Treatise. These diseases may be considered under the several heads of Diseases of the Appendages of the Skin, as of the cuticle and nails the Non-Mahgnant Ulcers of the Skin; and the Malignant Ulcers and Tumours of this tissue. We have already, in Chapter VI., considered the- ordinary non-malignant ulcers of the skin, and in Chapter XXXIV. some- of the simple tumours that occur in connection -with this tissue ; we shall here, therefore, only consider the Diseases of the Afpendarjes of the Stein, and the- MaR(jnant Ulcers and Tumours. DISEASES OP THE APPENDAGES OP THE SKIN. Wahts consist of elongated papillm, with strata of thickened and hardened cuticle, usually situated about the hands and face, and chiefly affecting young- people ; they appear in many cases to be simple overgrowths of the cutaneous structures, coming and going without any evident cause. In other cases they are more permanent, becoming hardened and dark in coloim, and continuing perhaps through life. ^ The Treatment of warts is usually sufficiently simple. As their vitality is low, they may be readily destroyed by the application of caustics or astringents ; among the most useful of these, I have found the concentrated acetic acid and the tincture of the sesquichloride of iron. Brodie recommends the solution of a drachm of arsenious acid in half an ounce of nitric acid. In some cases, they may be ligatured or snipped off with advantage. (.loRNS usually consist of small thickened masses of epidermis, accumulated on those points on which undue ft-iction or pressure has been exercised, in order to guard the subjacent cutis from injury. These epidermic masses are usuaUySURGICAL DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 88o hfiicl, dry, and scaly ; at other times they arc soft and spongy, Avlien situated in places where the secretions ot the skin accuinnlate, and keep them moist. Under old and very thickened corns, it is stated by Ilrodie that a small bursa is occasioirally found ; this bursa may suppurate, and become very painful. Corns arc at all times sufficiently painlnl, but become especially so if inflam- mation or suppuration take place beneath them ; the accumulation of a small drop of pus under the thickened cuticle, which prevents its escape, giving rise to very intense agony. There is a special form of warty corn that I have seen only in the sole of the foot, and which may become the source of the greatest possible pain and inconvenience to the patient, preventing his walking, and in fact completely crippling him. This corn is usually of small size and round in shape, the neighboiming cuticle being always greatly thickened and hardened. It is extremely sensitive to the touch, the patient shrinking when it is pressed upon, as if an exposed ller^n had been injured. On slicing it down wth a scalpel, it wiU be found to be composed of soft, tough, and white epidermis, aiTanged in tufts or small columns, in the centre of each of which a minute black dot is perceptible. Each tuft appears to be an elongated and thickened papilla, and the black speck is a small point of coagulated blood which has been effused into it. Aimmd the depression in which each of these corns is seated, the hardened cuticle forms a kind of wall. The Treatment of ordinary corns consists in shaving or rasping them down so as to prevent the deep layers of cuticle, retained by the indmated superficial ones, from giving rise to pain by pressure on the papiUm of the cutis. Eehef may also be afforded by removing all pressure from bearing upon the corn, by attention to the shape of the shoe, and by wearing a piece of soft leather or of amadou, having a hole cut in the centre into which the corn projects. It is well to avoid the application of caustics to ordinary corns; injm'ious con- sequences being often produced by these agents, especially in elderly people, in whom fatal gangrenous inflammation, as I have seen in one case, may be excited by their action. If the corn suppurate, it must be poulticed and shaved down, and the drop of pus let out by punctiu'e with a lancet. The painful papillated com of the sole of the foot is the only form of corn in which an escharotic can be safely used. I have found the appheation of potassa fusa, so as to destroy it thoroughly, to be the best and the speediest remedy; and, as this corn always ocems in young people, no danger attends its use. Perforating Ulcer of the Foot consists in a sinus that traverses the foot between the metatarsal bones. It is unconnected with any disease of the osseous or articular structmes, and ocems in otherwise perfectly healthy persons. The mechanism of the disease appears to be as follows. A hard corn forms on the sole ; suppuration takes place under this ; the pus is imable to escape through the indurated cuticle, and consequently travels upwards and finds an exit on the dorsiun of the foot, through an ulcerated opening there. On passing a probe through this opening, it will impinge on the corn in the sole, in which perhaps there may be found a small perforation, allowing an imperfect discharge of pus The Treatment consists in stimulating the interior of the sinus, and m I providing an aperture in the sole of the foot for the escape of the pus. This is ' done by passing a seton of two silk threads through the sinus. i I88i I^^GROWING OF THE NAIL. Disisases of the Nails.—The nails may become diseased, by undeigiowing structural changes, by haring their matrix inflamed, or by growing into the soft tissues of the toes. In some broken states of health, and especially in persons suffering from squamous disease of the skin, the nails occasionally become blackish or dark- brm\Ti in colour, are rugged, dry, and cracked, scaling off, as it were, without any apparent affection of the matrix. This condition, of which I have seen several instances, is best cimed by a course of alteratives and sarsaparilla, the disease yielding as the general health becomes improved. OxYCHiA is a disease of the nails dependent on inflammation of the matrix ; it occin’s under two forms, the simpU and the specific. In Simple Onychia there are redness, heat, and swelling, usually on one side of the nail, in the angle of the tissue in which it is implanted ; there is discharge of pus, and the nail gradually loosens, becomes dark-coloured, some- what shrivelled, aud may eventually be thrown off, a new nail making its appearance below, Avhich commonly assumes a somewhat thickened and rugged shape. This disease usually results from slight degrees of violence, as the running of thorns and splinters into the fingers. The Treatment consists in subduing inflammation by local antiphlogistics, poulticing, &c., aud watching the growth of the new nail, which may be some- times usefully directed by the application of a layer of wax. Specific Onychia is a more serious affection, and is often dependent on injuries inflicted on the finger in a syphilitic or cachectic condition of the system. In it a dusky-red or livid inflammation takes place at the sides or root of the nail; ulceration is set up, accompanied by the discharge of sanious and very fetid pus ; and large loose granulations spring up at its root and sides, so that the end of the toe or finger that is affected (and this is most commonly either the great toe, the thumb, or the index finger) becomes gveatly enlarged and bulbous in shape. The nail then shrivels, becomes brown or black, and peels off in strips (Tig. 322) ; after its separation, thick epidermic masses, forming abortive attempts at the production of a new nail, are deposited at the base and sides. In the Treatment, both local and constitutional means are requmed. The first and most essential point is to remove the nail, either in whole or part, as it acts as a foreign body, and prevents the healing of the surface from which it springs : the ulcer may then be treated with iodoform or well rubbed with the nitrate of silver, and dressed with black wash. Colles recommends fumigating it with a mercurial candle, made by melting a drachm of cinnabar and two ounces of white wax together. The consHhitional treat- ment consists of means calculated to improve the general health ; with this ■view Sir A. Cooper recommends calomel and opium. I have generally found bichloride of mercury, with sarsaparilla or cinchema, the most useful remedy. IxGHOwixa OP THE Nail is an extremely painful and troublesome affection, principally occurring in the great toe, and brought about by wearing pointed shoes, by which the sides of tlie soft part of the toe are pressed upon and VOL.

An nicer here forms, the liability to which is greatly increased by the nail being cut sejuare, so that the flesh presses against a sharp and projecting corner of it; this ulcer secretes a fetid sanious discharge, and large granulations are thrown up by it. The conse- quence is inability to walk or even stand with comfort. Treatment.—Various plans have been devised with a view of raising the edge of the nail, partially removing it, and pressing aside the soft structures. I have never, however, seen much pennanent benefit result from any of these means ; and the only method that is, I think, really serviceable to the patient, is the removal of the whole nail. As this operation is an excessively painful one, the patient should be anassthetised with nitrous oxide, or the matrix should be rendered insensible by the ether-spray. The Surgeon holds the diseased toe in his left hand, and then running one blade of a strong shaip-pointed pair of scissors under the nail up to its very root, he cuts through its whole length, and, removing the scissors, seizes first one half and then the I V other mth a pair of dissecting forceps, and twists them away I fitt^'Chments. The raw surface left is covered f i water-dressing, and speedily throws out granulations f i k 'which form the rudiments of a new nail. The new nail m I sVil usually grows straight and healthy. In some rare cases, % however, I have seen a faulty direction assumed by it. f Avulsion of the toe-nail is usually imattended by danger. I was, however, once called upon to amputate a foot for gaugi-ene,which had followed the operation performed on an rig. 323.—Hypertro- elderly person. of Hypertrophy op Toe-Nail.—Occasionally from neglect the tqe-nail may become enormously hypertrophied and twisted, looking more like a horn than a nail, as in the accompanying drawing (Fig. 323), taken from a patient in whom the nail had been allowed to oTow uncut for twenty years, producing complete lameness. I removed the nail whole by axudsion, and a sound and useful foot resulted. TUMOURS AND ULCERS OP THE SKIN, Cheloid and Fibro-vascular Tumours of the skin are semi-mahgnant oTowths situated on the trunk and extremities, usually flat and expanded, oval, round or irregular in shape, slightly elevated above the surface of the skin, and commonly occun’ing in otheiwise healthy individuals. They may remain stationary for years, but not imcommonly have a tendency eventually to ulcerate, to bleed, and to assume a sort of mahgnant action ; at other times they extend slowly, without ulceration, moving forwards as it were upon the skin the part over which they have passed assuming much the appearance of the cicatrix of a burn, being red, contracted, drawn in towai'ds the centre, and Avrinkled. Closely alhed to these are those fibro-plastic growths that have a tendency to sprout up in scars, constituting the Warty Tumours of Cicatrices, described by Cmsar Hawkins. This morbid condition appears to be simply an abnormal increase in the activity of the development of the cicatricial tissue, which springs up udth great luxmiance. They are especiaUy apt to ^llow the irre<^ular cicatrisation of bums, more particularly in children. I have,883 LUPUS. liowcvcr, seen them in the adult, occasioned both in tin's way and by the imtation of a blister. The warty cicatricial tissue chiefly develops on the chest and neck, and is commonly attended by much itcliin«; and tingling, often of a most distressing character. It is very vascular, bleeding freely when incised. Treatment.—These various forms of tinnour should, if possible, be extii’pated early by the knife, as they do not appear to be amenable to any constitutional or local treatment, and have certainly a disjDosition to malignant degeneration. As there is a great tendency to local recun’ence of the disease after removal, it should be widely excised ; but even then it is likely enough to return, re- quiring perhaps repeated operations before the patient can be freed from it. Lupu.s.—Under the term luious, various simple specific semi-malignant and malignant affections of the skin, of very different kinds, are commonly included ; indeed, the distinctions between lupus and the different forms of epithelial cancer have not as yet been well made out; and the term “ lupus ” is rather loosely applied to all rapidly destructive forms of chronic idceration, more especially when affecting the skin of the face. There are thi-ee foims, at least, in which the diseases included under the term lupus may make their appear- ance : 1, as a superficial affection of the skin, not attended by ulceration, but accompanied by important special and destrnctive changes in its tissue : this is the Lupus Non-exedens of some wi’iters ; 2, as the Lupus Exedens, a disease of a rapidly destructive character, not only eroding superficially, but destroying the tissues deeply ; 3, as a slowly ulcerating form of the disease, giving rise to the different ^ arieties of Lupoid or Rodent Ulcer. These various forms of lujpus are most commonly seated on the face or neck, but are occasionally met with on other parts of the body, as upon the limbs or trunk. 1. Lupus Non-exedens appears in the shape of a red patch on the skin, covered by fine branny epidermic desquamation ; it may remain stationary for years, or slowly spread over a great extent of surface, producing contraction of the skin, ^vlth wrinkling and drawing in of the featm-es, and much stiffness in their movements. The integument affected by it may be in one of two states • It may either continue red, irritable, and branny, having the appearance of a thin cicatricial tissue, and in this way the greater part or the whole of the face 3 L 2884 SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE SKIN. face, I believe, however, that of these forms of disease, that which is limited to the nose, and that which extends widely over and through the face, essen- tially differ from one another. The first is generally of a Scrofulous character, in fact consisting of strumous ulceration in one of the extreme parts of the body, the vitality of which is below its normal standard, and usually occur- ring in young persons, especially in women from eighteen to twenty-five years of age, A second variety is of SyjphUitic origin, being one of the most serious forms of remote tertiary syphilis ; and the third is the true Lupoid or rodent ulcer. The strumous form of lupus exedens, that which destroys merely the- extremity of the nose, is commonly rapid in its progress, the part appearing to melt dovm under the disease, so that in the course of a few weeks the whole of the organ is destroyed. In other cases it is very slow, occupying perhaps many years, and partaking somewhat of the red and branny form of lupus non- exedens. Occasionally it is evidently associated with and dependent upon the- syphilitic taint, and ought then to be considered rather as a variety of local syphilis in a strumous constitution than as a distinct affection. Microscopic Structure.—It is not often that we have an opportunity of examining niicroscopically the structure of the less active forms of lupus. Some time ago, however, I removed by excision a patch of lupus non-exe- dens, which had existed for four- teen years under the chin of a woman aged thu’ty, who was otherwise in good health. On examination, it was found to be composed of large cells many times larger than blood-discs, ha'S’ing clear and very distinct cell-walls, and weU-marked re- fracting nuclei. There were some- cells clear and globular, without nuclei; others Avere fusiform and elongated, with nuclei, evidently undergoing fibro-plastic transfor- mation (Fig. 324). Molecular movement was very distinct in one of these globular cells. The mass of skin appeared to be converted into granular matter, intermixed with these “The Biagnoeis of scrofulous lupus is not always easy, the aisease beiug SBedolly apt to be confounded wdth some forms of impetigo, wi A syphilitic ESs and sores, and ivith cancer.

From e]}illiehal cancer, lupus cannot in some cases be distinguished ; the two affections indeed being closely blended together, and being scarcely recognisable as distinct diseases. The Treatment of lupus depends in a great measure upon the yariety or the disease with which we have to do, and the constitutional condition attending it, and calls for the employment not only of local but of general remedies. In Liqms Non-execlens we may, if the disease be limited, excise the patch and heal the sore that results by granulation. Not unfr'equcntly, however, the cicatrix is apt to undergo fibro-vascular degeneration. If recourse be not had to excision, on account of the extent and superficial character of the disease, it is useless to attempt to destroy it by caustics. In every case in which I have seen these tried, they have failed in effecting a cure. In some instances, however, the application of a strong solution of the nitrate of silver to the morbid siuface will induce a healthier action ; though in the majority of instances local applications of a soothing kind can alone be borne. Lotions con- taining glycerine are especially useful, as they prevent the siu-face from becoming diy and harsh. If the disease be situated on the face, care should be taken to avoid exposure to cold winds, dust, &c. In the constiLuUonal treatment, the avoidance of stimulants of aU kinds, the use of a bland diet, and the employ- ment of some of the preparations of arsenic, will be found to be the most likely means to effect a cime. Indeed, arsenic may be considered the great remedy in this disease ; the liquor arsenicahs, or the iodide in combination with small doses of biniodide of mercury, will be found extremely useful; Donovan’s solution is also most beneficial in many instances. The treatment of Liqms Execlens must have reference to the constitutional condition in Avhich it occurs ; if this be of a strumous character, the adminis- tration of cod-liver oil and the iodide of potassium, Avith a nourishing diet, Avill be most serviceable ; in a syphilitic constitution, the remedies that are appli- cable to the cure of tertiary syphilis, such as the perchloride of mercury and Donovan’s solution, are especially useful. In many cases also in AA'hich there can be no suspicion of a syphilitic taint, these preparations of mercury, as well as the iodides of the same metal, may be administered empirically with great advantage. The liquor arsenicahs, or the combination of arsenic, iodine, and mercury that exists in Donovan’s solution, or that is contained in a pill composed of one-sixth of a grain of iodide of arsenic and one-tAvelfth of a grain of binio- dide of mercury, as recommended by A. T. Thomson, has appeared to me to be extremely beneficial, and in many cases certainly exercises a marked influence in arresting the disease. Whilst the patient is undergoing a course of these remedies, much attention requires to be paid to his diet, clothing, and general hygienic conditions. In the local treatment, the first thing that requires to be done is to subdue inflammatory action and in-itatiou, by leeches, emollient lotions, and opiate or henbane poultices. As this subsides, the progress of the disease will usually be an-ested for a time at least; and then, by the application of the nitric acid, chloride of zinc, or the acid nitrate of mercury, to the surfiice, a more healthy action may bo set up, and the sore be made to cicatrise.

The patient should, therefore, for some length of time after reco\'ery, be careful not to expose him- self to any such influences. In the more rapidly spreading and worst forms of lupus exedens, that liorrible disease termed by the older Surgeons “ Noli-me- tangere,” nothing can be done beyond the relief that is afforded by the adminis- tration of opiates, and a general sedati’^-e plan of treatment. 3. Rodent Ulcer is one of those remarkable affections that stand midway between simple and malignant diseases ; being, so far as constitutional causes 01 secondaiy complications are concerned, apjiarently of a simple nature, while, to a certain extent, in regard to structui'al condition and entirely in respect to- local effects, it is of a mahgnant character. The disease is especially charac- teiised by its slow progress, by its eroding nature, and by the impossibility of heahng it by all ordinary methods of treatment. It is essentially a disease of advanced age, seldom beginning before 45 or 50. Its duration is in any given case indefinite ; seldom less than five or six years, occasionally extending* to twenty or thirty. It affects individuals of either sex indiscriminately ; and deeply into the cancellous structure, as of the head of the tibia or the diploo of the skull. It erodes and eats away the bone, without caries or necrosis. It may penetrate to the dura mater, and invade the brain. It progresses, however, by preference superficially, not in depth; hence it is seldom at- tended by hcemorrhage, even in the more advanced stages. The neigh- usuaUy occurs in persons who are otherwise perfectly healthy. The health also is not influenced materially, if at all, by its long- duration.

The face is its seat of election, especially in the upper parts, such as the forehead, the side of the nose, the imier angle of the eye, or the temple. It spreads simply by continuity of tissue, never by disseminated local or by secondary deposits. It may invade all tissues; the skin primarily, the pinna of the ear, the alse and septum of the nose, the parotid gland, the conjunctiva and the eye- ball. It is especially destructive to bone when once it attacks it, and will spreadSY}fPTOMS OF RODENT ULCER. 887 bouring lymphatic glands do not become implicated, and secondary visceral deposits are never met Avith. As the ulceration extends, there is often a tendency to imperfectcicati-isation on one margin, whilst the disease is making progress at the other. It always commences in the skin, usually on healthy in- tegument ; but occasionally it primarily affects a portion of the skin which is the seat of some chronic change of structure, as a mole, a wart, or a scar. Symploms.—In whatever situation it begins, its first appearance is in the shape of a tubercle or hard pimple of a bro\vnish-red colour. This is most commonly seen on the side of the nose, on the mouth, or on the cheek. This tubercle ulcerates slowly ; and then the disease extends. Moore, to whom we are indebted for a most lucid account of this terrible afiection, lays especial stress on its commencement in a hard wart, and its continued extension by a hard margin. This ulcerated tubercle becomes covered by a scab ; but, as the process of destructive ulceration progresses, the sore becomes too large to be covered by a scab, and an ulcer is left. This ulcer, which constitutes the disease, and is the true “ Lvpus," or “ NoU-me-tangere ” of the older authors, presents the folloAving characters. It is depressed slightly below the surface, is of a pale pink colour, with a furrowed rather than a granulating surface, resembling by its furrowed smoothness an irregular layer of pink wax, and is usually painless, except where cicatrising. The ulceration, sometimes running- on too rapidly for the margin, invades and destroys it in parts, cicatrising unequally and unhealthily ; in other cases it leaves in its advance a track of bluish-reddish-white thin cicatrix, which is apt to be again invaded and destroyed by fresh deposit of the lupoid tubercle. In fact, in its ulcerative progress and eroding action, it destroys its own indurated margin, eats away its o^vn morbid deposit more rapidly than it can be reformed, and so, here and there reaching healthy tissues, allows an opportunity for cicatrisation to take place on one side, whilst it is progressing on another. The cicatrices are altogether unstable, and are hable to be broken dorni by these rencAved invasions of the disease. Whether it be fast or slow, the course of the disease is always progressive; more rapid in the skin, more sIoav in the bones and less vascular tissues, as those of a cartilaginous and fibroid character; the pinna of the ear, the sclerotic, and the septum of the nose, for instance. "When it attacks bones, it perforates them, and sinks deeply into their sol'ter parts. Moore has noticed that the morbid gi-OAvth in fr-ont of the advancing disease is always most clearly marked in cancellated bone—in the diploe, foi instance. The solt parts immediately contiguous to the disease are perfectly Fig. 326.-—Rodent Ulcer : Rcrforatioii of Skull and exposure of Dura Muter. healthy and uuinfiltrated ; and there is never, even after many years of proo-ress any sign 01 secondary affection of the lymphatic glands.

This fatnl teriiiinatioii tuny, however, be long delayed. The accompanying Fig. 320 is from a patient of mine who had suffered from the disease lor nearly thirty years, but who was to all appearance in perfect health, although the skull was perforated, the dura mater exposed, and the pulsations of the brain distinctly \dsible. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis has to be made from Epithelioma, Syphilis, and Lupus. The distinction from ordinary cjAtlielioma is often at first difficult; but in the later stages the absence of glandular affection, the small amount of growth compared to the ulceration, and the prolonged course of the case, render the diagnosis easy. From tertiary syphilis it is clearly distinguished by the duration of the case. In syphilitic ulceration “ the rate of destruction is measimed by weeks ; in rodent cancer, by years.” There is also an absence of all other signs of constitutional syphilis. From ordinary lupus it is distinguished by the age and healthy constitutional state of the patient, by the singleness of the ulcer, and the absence of the pink, scaly, or oedematous skin frequently found around lupus. Lupus may cicatrise and cease at any time ; rodent cancer never does. Lupus possesses contractihty; rodent cancer has none. Lupus rarely causes death ; rodent ulcer is always eventually fatal. Pathology.—The microscopic characters of the solid infiltrating substance have been examined by Moore, Hulke, and C. Warren, aU of whom have found some parts which presented appearances identical with epithelioma. Moore found this in the diploe of the frontal bone, and Hulke in a part of the globe of the eye implicated in the disease. The greater part of the growth presents characters differing but httle from those of ordinary granulation-tissue. Moore was of opinion that the growth commenced in aU cases in a pimple identical in structure with epithelioma, but that this character was lost as the growth extended, but could be readily assumed again in “ certain situations or in convenient textimes.” The conclusions at which Dr. Colhns Warren arrives as the result of his researches, are, that rodent ulcer is a form of epithelial cancer; and that it differs fr’om the more ordinary forms of epithehoma in the small size of the cells. The arrangement of these epithelial cells may be tubular and alveolar (Fig. 327). We have seen from the foregoing description of the disease, that rodent cancer is a solid growth, having no limitation by a cyst, infiltrating and super- seding the natural textures, exhibiting a power of continuous increase, infecting the adjoining parts, so that an incision, where they appear healthy, is yet followed by a return of the disease, and ultimately degenerating and dis- appearing, destroying with itself all the tissues which it had penetrated. On these grounds Moore considers himself justified in classing it with the cancels, in spite of the absence of glandular and constitutional infection. But this view appears to be open to doubt. Although it is impossible not i to admit that in some cases, and in some parts of most cases, rodent ulcei is in its histology closely allied to, if not identical with, some of the less active forms of epithelioma, yet it is equally certain that the great mass of the active part of a rodent ulcer presents nothing that is structurally cancerous, and that clinically it differs from all and every variety of that disease in the most marked manner. We have abundant proof in other diseases, such as the889 RODENT ULCER AND GANGER COMPARED. enchonclromata, for instance, that they may differ from cancer histologically, but resemble it clinically in some of their varieties. May we not with justice see the converse here : viz., a disease that somewhat resembles histologically, but that differs in every respect clinically from, a cancerous deposit ? Clinical affinity is sm’ely of as much account as histological resemblance. Let us compare the two affections in their leading characters. In cancer, the disease often commences in early or at most middle life ; the rodent ulcer always in advanced life or old age. In cancer, there is an active vegetative outgrowth ; in rodent ulcer, destruction and absorption of tissue. Cancer usually commences deeply—rarely in the skin, which is involved secondarily; rodent ulcer always in the skin primarily, never in the deeper parts. -Epithelioma ever affects primarily the mucous or muco-cutaneous sur- iaces ; rodent ulcer, always the true skin. Cancer is rapid in its local progress ; rodent ulcer is slow beyond any other disease. Cancer is often primarily multiple, especially when superficial, developing or rapidly extending by many scattered tubercles ; rodent nicer is always single, arising from one solitary starting point. Cancer speedily gives rise to secondary deposits in contiguous structures ; rodent ulcer, never. Cancer leads to secondary visceral deposits ; Fig. 327.—Vertical Section of Rodent Ulcer—a, Epidermis halls—6, Stroma (after C. Warren). rodent ulcer never leads to implication of internal organs. Cancer produces constitutional cachexy, blood-changes, and malnutrition ; rodent ulcer, even when most chronic, is usually associated with perfect health. A cancerous ulcer shows no tendency to cicatrise ; a rodent ulcer always gives evidences of imperfect attempts at repair. A cancer, when removed by operation, almost invariably recurs ; a rodent ulcer, if completely extirpated, has no tendency to recurrence. Thus, then, in all essential respects, except in the one of occasional similarity in structure, so. far as the hardened edge of the rodent ulcer is concerned, the two diseases are not only so dissimilar, but even so clinically opposed, that it does not appear to be justifiable to group them together. It may, in fact, be said, that rodent ulcer is allied to, but not analogous to, the cancers ; that it IS more local and less constitutional, even secondarily, than epithelioma ; that,890 SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE SKIN. although allied to and in parts presenting some of the characteristics of this disease, yet it approaches much more nearly the ordinary structure of granu- lation-tissue ; that in point of malignancy, indeed, it stands in the same relation to epithelioma that this latter form of cancer does to the more acti^'e variety of scin'hus ; that there is just enough of malignancy in it to prevent the attempts of cicatrisation from becoming effectual, but not enough to occasion rapid progress in local ulceration, or to give rise to constitutional infection. From sciiThus to epithelioma, from epithelioma to rodent ulcer, we thus find, ■with certain intermediate links of structural affinity, a progressive decadence in the force of maligmant action. Treatment.—In the treatment, constitutional remedies are of no use, and local means alone are to be relied on. They consist: 1, in the application of caustics ; 2, in excision of the part; 3, in a combination of these two methods. 1. The ulcer may best be destroyed by the application of the chloride of zinc paste to the whole of its surface. The best mode of applying this is to keep the chloride prepared for use by being mixed Avith two or three parts of flour. When wanted, a sufficient quantity of this powder should be made into a stiff paste, by the addition of a little water, and then spread over the smTace to be attacked by it, in a layer of about the thickness of a wafer ; this should be left on for two or three hoiu’s, and then removed, the sore being covered with i\, piece of water-dressing until the greyish slough that has been produced has separated, when the caustic may be re-applied as often as necessary. Besides the chloride of zinc, various other caustics maybe had recom’se to, each of which possesses some peculiar advantages. The nitric acid is useful, if the action to be produced be not required to be very deep ; for, as it hardens and coagulates the tissues to which it is applied, it does not consequently extend so far as the chloride. The acid nitrate of mercury presents the same advantage as the nitric acid and other fluid caustics—that it can be applied into the fissm’es and holloAvs of the part into which the more solid caustics do not penetrate, and is certainly useful in inducing a healthy action in the part, especially if there be a syphilitic taint. The potassa fusa and Vienna paste are useful, so far as their destructive properties are concerned, but are somewhat uncontrollable, and apt to spread. TTie most convenient mode of applying them is to cut in a piece of plaster a hole of the exact size and shape of the ulcer, to apply this around its borders, then to cover the sore with a layer of potassa cum calce, one line in thickness, and over this to lay on another piece of plaster. In this way a considerable amount of caustic action may be induced, Avhich will be hmited to the exact surface to which it has been apphed. Of all these escharotics, the preference is to be given to the chloride of zinc ; its action is more continuous and more controllable, and it appears to give a healthy stimulus to the subjacent struc- tures. 2. Excision of the whole of the idcer may sometimes be very advantageously practised, especially Avhen it is situated on the cheek, eyelid, eye, or forehead ; and the gap left may be filled in by some of those plastic processes that will be described Avhen Ave come to speak of the Plastic Surgery of the Face. 3. When the ulcer has attained a large size, Avhen it is complicated in its outline, and iiTegular in its depth, the question arises AA’hether siu’gery offeis any resource, or AA'hether the patient should be left slowly and miserably to die.CANCER OF THE SKIN. 891 In these extreme cases e^'en, something may be done to prolong life and to relieve suffering, even if no cure be ultimately to be expected. Moore proved that, unless the brain be implicated, or some large vessel involved,^ something can usually be done at least to arrest the rapidity of the growth. I he met oc which he adopted Avas a combined use of the knife and of chloride of zinc. By these means he removed in some cases the Avholc of the affected parts, leaving a huge chasm in the face, and even in one case exposing the dura mater for a considerable extent oA'er the roof of the orbit. The operations were done on no regular plan, the incisions being directed solely by the shape of the growth, and no attemi)t being made to repair the deformity left. The results of these opei’ations were, on the Avhole, favourable. Out of six cases three recovered, and the threemthers received decided benefit, but were not j)ermanently cured. In all the cases in Avliich the chloride of zinc came into actual contact Avith the dura mater, ejAileptifoi’m fits occuiTcd, but only of a temporary character. lA'hen the disease is situated in an extremity, and the cancellous end of a bone especially is invoh'ed, as Avhen it dips into and erodes the head of the tibia or the loAA'er end of the radius, amputation would be the proper and only advantageous procedure. hen the disease is so extensive, or so situated, that absolutely nothing in an operative Avay can be done, the Simgeon must content himself by cov’ering up the raAV surface Avith lint soaked in glycerine and water, and protected by . oiled silk. C'axcer of the Skin.—Cancer may occur in the skin as a true scirrhous deposit. Most couuuonly, howeA'er, those affections of the skin termed cancerous consist of the epithelial form of the disease, and are usually seated about the lips, face, and scrotum, or at the orifices of the mucous canals ; these we have already considered generally, and shall have to revert to them more fuUy when treating of the special aftections of these parts. Irue cancer of the skin may occiu-in three forms : 1, as the Ihdm’ated Wart of a scin’hous character, specially described by Scarpa; 2, as Scirrhous Infiltration and Fungus ; or 3, as Ulcers which, primarily originating from local initation of a simple kind, may, by the persistence of this, assume a truly cancerous character ; thus I have seen the scrotum and the neighbour- hood of the apertures of fistulm in perinaeo, in a case of old-standing disease, become converted into a truly sciiThous mass. Cancer of the skin is apt to assume a melanotic character, owing to the large dcAelojAment in it of black pigmentary matter. Closely allied to it in appear- ance, if not in histological structure, is that most malignant disease (see p. 772) Melanotic Sarcoma, Avliich may be developed in connection AV'ith the in- tegumentary structures. I haAn met Avith two instances of late of this disease, one oil the foot, the other on the hand, of ladies both above seventy years or age. I he disease may readily be removed by caustics or the knife.

The Scirrhous Wart is usually of the natm-al eolour of the skin, but •sometimes of a reddish or dark-greyish hue, hard, and somewhat in-egular in shape. It may remain for a long time stationary, but at last ulcerates and spreads ra,pidly, giving rise to vast destruction of parts ; the ulcers formed by it presenting the characters of cancer, with a hard base, everted edges, and foul surface. 2. The Infiltrated Cancer of the Skin occurs in the form of a flat, dark, irregularly defined induration, which scabs over with dark, rugged, greyish- brown incrustations, having shooting pains in and around it, and, after re- maining stationary perhaps for years, runs into ulceration, and rapidly destroys the parts it affects. After ulceration has been set up, the patient’s life, accord- ing to Walshe, is seldom prolonged beyond two years. Emephaloid Cancer of the skin is of rare occmi’ence, but occasionally forms large fungating masses sprouting from, and solely connected with, this tissue. 3. Cancerous Ulcers of the Skin may arise from any local irritation ; or mi unhealthy and specific action may be set up in an old scar or ulcer, and cause it to assume a cancerous cha- racter (Fig. 328). These cancerous idcers may indeed occiu’ upon almost any part of the body ; I have seen them on the back, breast, fingers, hand, thigh, and sole of the foot. They are flat, grey, or sloughy-looking, often with large warty granulations and pro- tuberant masses, a good deal of indu- ration about them, and but httle dis- •charge. Their structm*e is usually that of scirrhus, but not infrequently melanotic growths and masses of melanoma are developed in them, and the neighbouring epidermis may be black in patches from melanotic deposits. The Treatment of cutaneous cancer consists in its excision, or in amputation of the limb affected. Its removal by excision, w'hether in the form of wart, crust, or ulcer, should be effected as soon as its true characters have declared themselves ; provided it be of such a size, and so situated, that it can be freely removed with a sufficient stratum of subjacent healthy parts, and a ivide border of siuTOunding skin. Should it be so situated that its excision through sm’rounding healthy tissue is not practicable, the hmb must be amputated, as was done in the case depicted in Fig. 328. In such circumstances the limb may be removed at no great distance above the disease ; it not being necessaiy, as in cases of cancer of the extremities where the bones are affected, to allow a joint to intervene between the seat of operation and the malignant erowth.SYMPTOMS OF NEURALGIA. 895 CHAPTER XXXVIII. —♦— DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. NEUBITIS. Inflammation of the Nerves, or rather of the Neurilemma, is not of very' unfi’equent occurrence, being usually the result of rheumatism, of wounds, or of strains. When Neuritis is rheumatic, it principally affects the nerves of the- face and the lower extremity. Symptoms.—These consist of tenderness on pressure along the course of the neiwe, and severe continuous pains running down its trunk and ramifying along its branches, vdth occasional violent exacerbations, especially on moving^ or touching the part, and at night; there are usually swelling along the course- of the trunk, and some pyrexia. When chronic, this condition may readily be confoimded with neuralgia ; of which, indeed, it constitutes one variety. On examination after death, the sheath of the nerve will be found injected and swollen, and the nervous tissue softened. Treatment.—This consists in the employment of antiphlogistic means cupping or the application of leeches, according to situation, poppy or bella- donna fomentations, and local emollients. When the neuritis is rheumatic, the- acetous extract of colchicum is the best remedy ; when it is more chronic and nocturnal, iodide of potassium, either alone or in combination with sarsaparilla, may advantageously be given. NEURALGIA. Neuralgia frequently occurs in siu-gical practice, either complicating other- diseases, or as a distinct affection simulating closely various organic lesions, more especially of joints and bones. Symptoms.—The pain in neuralgia is the essential symptom, and, in fact,, constitutes the disease itself. It may be of two kinds ; either foUovdng ana- tomically the course of a nen^e and the disti’ibution of its filaments ; or affect- ing a considerable portion of the smface without reference to any special neiwe. It is of all degrees of severity, sometimes moderate, sometimes unbearable, even by those who possess the gi’eatest fortitude ; when severe, it usually comes on suddenly, with a kind of shock, and continues of a shaiqi, darting, or tearing- character, coursing along the trunk or ramifications of the affected nerve, the distribution of which may often be distinctly indicated by the direction the pain takes. It is often accompanied by other sensations, such as a tickling.§94 DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. smarting, or creeping feeling on the affected surface ; in some instances re- lieved by pressure, in others increased by the slightest touch or movement of the part. Occasionally there is spasm in the museles supplied Ijy the affected nerve ; in other cases, there arc heat and redness of the surface, with increased secretion from the neighbouring organs, as a flow of saliva or tears when the neives of the jaw or eye are implicated. The duration of an attack may vary from a few moments to many days or months. The pain is most commonly intermittent or remittent; it is often in-egularly so, but in some instances the periodicity is well marked. Situations.—This disease may affect almost any part of the body; it is most commonly seated distinctly in the trunk and branches of a nerve. The divisions of the fifth pair are the most frequent seat of neuralgia ; the pain may extend to the whole of the branches of this nerve on one side of the head and face, but more commonly it is confined to one of its principal divisions, such as the infraorbital, which is especially liable to be affected ; in many in- stances it is seated in the temporal and dental nerves. Not unfrequently some of the terminal twigs alone of one of these nerves become the seat of intense pain ; thus occasionally the affection is found limited to a patch on the cheek, brow, or temple, from which it scarcely ever shifts. The posterior branches of the dorsal spinal nerves, and the intercostals, are also very commonly affected, though not to the same extent as the fifth pah-. In other cases the whole of an organ, or part, becomes the seat of nem-algia, though no one nerve may appear to be distinctly implicated; thus the testes, the breast, the uterine organs, or one of the larger joints, as the hip or knee, are occasionally the seats of severe suffering of this kind. Extreme cutaneous sensibility is a marked feature in some cases ; the patient wincing and suffering severely whenever the skin is pinched or touched, however lightly. Causes.—The causes of this painful disease are very various ; they may be constitutional or local. It seldom occurs in strong and healthy individuals, but is almost invariably associated with want of power, unless it be occasioned by some local mechanical cause. Depressing injimnees of all kinds are especially apt to produce it; thus, debilitating diseases, mental depression, and particu- larly exposiu-e to malaria, are common occasioning causes ; those forms of the disease that arise from malarial influences, or from exposure to simple cold and wet, usually assume a very intermitting or periodical character, and are com- monly seated in the nerves of the head. The hysterical tempierament very frequently disposes to the spinal and articular forms of neuralgia. There is no constitutional condition with which neuralgia is more fr-equently associated than with anmmia ; hence its frequency in females. As Romberg somewhat poetically says, “Neiu-algia is the prayer of the nerve for healthy blood.” Tarious sources of peripheral irritation, as loaded bowels, the irritation of worms, carious teeth, uterine disease, and calculus, may be recognised as producing some of the more obscure varieties of the disease. Neuralgia may also arise from any compression exercised upon the trunk of a nerve ; and in this way, indeed, some of the more intiactable foims of the affection have their origin. Thus, thickening of the neurilemma, the pressiu-e of a tumour of any kind, or of a piece of dead bone, may give rise to the most intense pain in the part supplied by the iri-itated nerve ; and it is not impro-895 TREATMENT OF NEURALGIA. bablc that, in many of the cases of neuralgia in the branches of the fifth nerve, pain may be owing to periosteal inflammation, or to some other disease of the osseous canals through which the di^’isions of the nerve pass. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of neuralgia, though usually elfected without any difficulty, is in some cases a little embarrassing, as the pain may occasionally simulate that of organic disease or inflammation of the part. From organic disease of the part that is the seat of suffering, such as the hip, the knee, the testis, or the breast, this disease may usually be distinguished by the co-exist- once of cutaneous sensibility, the existence of the hysterical temperament, and the absence of the other signs that would accompany lesion of structure in the ])art affected. From inflammation the diagnosis is usually sufficiently easy, by attending to the intermittent character of the neuralgic pain, to its occiuTcnce in hysterical temperaments, and to the absence of the constitutional symptoms of inflammation. But occasionally, when local inflammatory irritation is con- joined ivith the neuralgia, the diagnosis is difficult. Here the presence of cutaneous sensibility and the relief of the pain by fii’m pressure will indicate neuralgia ; whereas, in inflammation, there is no tenderness of surface, but the suffering is aggravated by deep pressure. Treatment.—The treatment of neimalgia must have reference to the eause of the disease, and will be successful or not according as this may be more or less readily removed. So long as the conditions that primarily occasion the disease subsist, the pain is likely to continue : and if these conditions be irre- movable, the disease may be looked upon as necessailly incurable, though the suffering may be alleviated by appropriate means. When it arises from any central nervous affection, there may be fear of the ultimate occm-reuce of disease of a more serious type, such as epilepsy, insanity, &c. "WTien it occiu’s as the consequence of amemia, or in the hysterical tempera- ment, the administration of the more stimulating and stronger preparations of iron, such as the sulphate or the perchloride, or the mistm’a fenl composita, either alone or in combination with quinine, with attention to the state of the bowels and of the uterine functions, and a general tonic regimen calculated to brace and improve the general health, such as sea-bathing, the cold douche, or sponging, will be of essential service. In some of these cases the combinations of zinc, especially the valerianate, with the fetid gums, will remove the disease when iron does not influence it much. At the same time, the application of belladonna or aconite plasters, or the inunction of these liniments may be of service. When the neimalgia is distinctly periodical, quinine in full doses, or the liquor arsenicalis, will usually effect a speedy cm-e. "Wlien it is rheumatic, occuiTing in debilitated subjects, and attended by distinct noctiUTial exacerba- tions of pain, no remedy exercises so great an impression upon it as the iodide of potassium, especially when administered in combination with quinine. In the more severe and protracted forms of the disease, relief may be occa- sionally obtained by attention to the state of the liver and digestive organs, by a course of some of the more purgative mineral waters, and by the occasional administration of aloetics or croton-oil, followed by tonic remedies. Local applications of a sedative kind, such as chioroform, belladonna, aconite opium, &c., ai’e often useful adjuncts to constitutional treatment. By far the readiest mode of affording relief locally is the hypodermic injection. Xot moreS96 DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. than from onc-sixth to a (|uartcr of a gTain of morphia should at first bo used at one time, and the action of this small dose is often very powerful. More than this, it is unsafe to begin with ; but the (quantity may be enormously increased. I have had a patient who, to relieve the pains attending cancer of the rectum and anus, required no less than six gi-ains to be injected every twelfth hour. In some cases a single injection has cured neuralgia which has resisted all other- means. In many cases all these means, however, are unfortunately unavailing, and the sufferer is doomed to an existence of almost constant pain, except at times when the disease appears to cease of itself, or has its intensity blunted by the administration of the more powerful sedatives, such as morphia hypodermically, or veratria, aconite, or atropine externally. In these distressing cases the sufferer is ready to grasp at any means of relief that is held out to him ; and section of the affected nerve is not unfrequently recommended as a last chance of the removal of the disease. It is clear, however, that such an operation, though occasionally j)roductive of temporary relief, cannot in most cases be expected to benefit the patient permanently ; for by it the cause of the neuralgia is not removed, and it can consequently only be of service when the pain is peripheral, occasioned by some local initation existing between the part cut and the terminal branches of the nerve. If the neuralgia depend on any central cause, or on local irritation existing higher up than the point divided, the operation must eventually be useless. Thus, if the source of irritation exist in the terminal branches of the infraorbital nerve, the division of this trunk might be useful; but if the pain be occasioned by any pressm-e to which this nerve may be subjected in its passage through its canal by a carious state of the bones, or by disease of the periosteum, it would be unavailing ; though it is a remarkable fact, that it not unfr’equently happens that there is after these- operations a temporary cessation in the pain for a few weeks or months. In some of these cases, however, the pain shifts its seat from the branch operated on to another division of the same trunk ; thus, if the infraorbital have been divided, the inferior dental or submental nerve becomes the seat of pain. Or- this may ascend, as it were, to the point at which the nerve was divided ; thus, after amputation for neuralgia of the knee, the pain may return in the stump,, and again when this is removed a second or even third time. The nerves on which section has been most frequently performed are the different branches of the fifth—the infr-aorbital, the inferior dental, and the submental. Should it ever be thought necessary to do it, it would be proper not only to divide the nerve, but to excise a portion of it; otherwise reunion will speedily take place, and the continuity of the nerve being re-established,, the operation will fail. The procedure, when apphed to the infr’aorbital and the submental nerves, simply consists in cutting down on the trimk where it escapes from the foramen, isolating and dissecting out a portion of it; m doing this, no great difficulty can be experienced by any one possessing moderate anatomical knowledge. Langenbeck has proposed excision of that part of the infraorbital nerve which lies in the orbit. A tenotomy-knife is caiTied along the outer wall of the oi-bit, and the iienn is divided where it escapes from the- spheno-maxillary fissm-e. Wood of New York has successfully excised the trunk as far back as its exit ifom the skull through the ioramen rotundiim.897 TRAUMATIC NEURALGIA. In one case of his which I ha^-e seen, a complete cure was effected, the patient, a liealthy man, being entirely free ft'om the neuralgia one year and a-half after the operation. racial Neuralgia more frequently takes its origin in the irritation of a dental nerve than in any other branches of the fifth. This necessarily arises fi-om the frequency Mdth which the terminal branches of those nerves become iiTitated in consequence of the presence of carious, broken, inflamed, or over- crowded teeth; and on the removal of these local and eccentric causes of irritation the pain usually ceases. There is, however, one form of neiu-algia of the dental nerve that is so severe and so persistent in its general duration, and so paroxysmal in its attacks, that it constitutes a true Tic. This neuralgia may affect either jaw. I have most frequently met with it in the lower, and more commonly in women than in men. It occurs in jDeople who have lost teeth ; and the pain, which is excessively acute and paroxysmal, commences in and darts from the contracted alveoli and the condensed and indurated ffum o covering them. It appears to be owing to the compression of the terminal branches of the dental nerves by the contraction upon them of the empty alveoli. Taking this view of the pathology of this form of nem'algia, I have treated it by the removal of a portion of the indurated alveolar border and gum. Some years ago I did this in a patient of Dunn’s, removing a V-shaped piece of the bone by means of a Key’s saw ; and more recently, I have in addition clipped away the bone by means of cutting pliers. Gross, who has directed attention to this form of uemalgia, uses the pliers only for the removal of the affected bone. In any case it is necessary to cut into, but not through, the body of the bone. By this incision, the dental canal may be opened in the body of the bone, and the nerve destroyed by means of the galvanic cauteiy. The inferior dental nerve has in some cases of intense and persistent neuralgia been divided by a very ingenious operation. This consists in dis- secting up a flap over the ramus of the lower jaw, applying a trephine to the bone so exposed, and cutting out a portion of it over that part where the nerve enters the dental canal, which is thus laid bare ; when a portion of the nerA e may be excised, by being raised on a director, and snipped away with scissors.* Traumatic Neuralgia is commonly the result of gun-shot injury, of the implication of nerves in cicatrices, or of their compression by callus. The neuralgia in these cases is usually of the most intense character, often attended by spasm of the muscles, and sometimes by anmsthesia of parts of the limb affected. It is due to the extension of inflammation of and chronic thickening of the membrane, and the interfascicular areolar tissue, which becomes immensely hypertrophied, thus compressing the nerve fibres. The accompary- mg drawing (Fig. 329), from a case in which Drs. Sands and Seguin, of New York, excised the cords which go to form the brachial plexus, close to the inteiwertebral foramma, illustrates well this compression of the nervous struc- ture by dense masses of interfascicular areolar tissue gi’eatly hynertronhied and permeated by dilated blood-vessels. * Trcaimmt.—ToQ smaller nerves of the limbs have repeatedly been divided See Dr. Weir Jlitcheirs admirable monograph on “ Injuries of Nerves and thoir Consequonees.”898 DISEASES OF TIIL NERVOUS SYSTEM. or partially excised, iir eases of persistent traumatic neuralgia. The larger nervous trunks, such as the median, musculo-spiral, and ulnar, have been tieated in the same way in the upper ; aud the external popliteal, and even the sciatic nerve in the lower limb, has been partially excised as a last resource in extreme cases. These operations have in some cases effected a permanent cure, in others they have been followed by temporary I’elief only. It was reserved for Sands, of New York, to remove a section of the whole brachial plexus close to the exit of the nerves from the spinal column. This was done in a lad aged eighteen, whose right arm had been seriously injured in firing a salute. The arm was amputated, but the patieut suffered the most agonizing torture from chronic nerve-lesion high up iu the limb. So great were his sufferings that he became uncontrollable in his actions, and, though perfectly sane, gave way to fits of the most intense excitement. The operation consisted in making an incision along the outer border of the right stenio-niastoid, and a transverse one following the line of the clavicle. The J-shaped flap was tinned up, the carotid sheath and its contents carried to one side, and the brachial plexus exposed. A piece fully a quarter of an inch in length was cut out from the four lower cenical and first dorsal nerves, fr’om Fig. 329.—Section from Lower Cord of Brachial Plexus near Intervertebral Foramina, showing the lesioris which Fig. 329 has been taken. Considerable improvement, though not com- plete relief from suffering, followed the operation. Stretching of Nerves.—Nussbaum has the great merit of haviug introduced Seguin).899 NEUROMA. this operation for the case of traumatic neuralgia. In a case of this kind nlfecting the arm, and resulting from gun-shot injury, he cut down on and stretched the ulnar nerve, then the nerves suri'ouuding the brachial artery, and lastly the brachial plexus itself, pulling vigorously on the nervous cords. The result was a perfect cure. This operation has been done successfully by Cal- lender on the median nerve, by Marcus Beck on the cords of the brachial plexus in a case of intense neuralgia and spasm of the stump after amputation at the shoulder, and by others. The effect of the stretching is doubtless to break through the hypertrophied and condensed neurilemma and interfascicular areolai- tissue, and thus to relieve the nerve-trunks of undue pressure. NEUBOMA. By Ueiiroina is meant a tumoiu’ comiected with a nerve (see also p. 758). This timiour may vary from the size of a millet-seed to that of a melon ; it is usually sohd and composed of fibrous tissue ; but when it attains a large buUc, a ■cavity may form in it, containing a yellowish or brownish serous-looking fluid, apparently owing to the disintegration of the central portions of the mass. In shape it is usually oval or oblong, the long axis corresponding to the course of the nerve (Fig. 330) ; it grows slowly, and is movable transversely, but not in the direction of the nervous trmik on which it is seated; it has no a]5pearance of malignancy, and, however large it becomes, it never contracts adhesions to the integument nor involves its structure. jSTeiu’oma com- monly only affects the nerves of the cerebro-spinal system ; but Berard has met with one case of the disease on a R'ane’- home nerve. The nerves of special sense are but very rarely the seat of this disease. Indeed, the only recorded ■case Avith which I am acquainted of a nemoma connected with one of these nerves, is one described by Lidell of New York, of a nemnma of the optic nerve filling up the orbit, flattening and in-otruding the eye, and extirpated together with the contents of the orbit by that Surgeon. Most commonly the tumoin is single, and then is usually attended with very severe lancinating or neuralgic pain, which extends, howeA’er, only to the parts below the tiunour, and is commonly paroxysmal. This pain is evi- •dently owing to the stretching of the nervous twigs as they pass along the convexity of the growth. When single and painful, the tumour sometimes goes by the name of the Fainful SuTjcutaiieo'us Tubercle, though the name is also applied to another form of tumour (see — Neuroma p- 7o2). It is then usually met with fr-om the size of ouUver^ a pins head to that of a cherry-stone, commonly seated upon the limbs ^d most fr'cquently in connection Avith one of the nerves of the lower cx- lemity : but it may be situated upon the arm, the trunk, or CA^en on the scrotum and cheek, where, hoAvever, it is not so commonly met Avith A^hercA'cr a single neuroma occurs, it is acutely and intolerably painful on being touched and IS usually tender as well. It is a very remarkable fact that, though ucuro- 3 M 2900 DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. iTiatous tuuionrs when single, or ■when but two or throe exist, are most acutely painful, yet, when they are generally diffused over the body, they lose their sensibility, and are unattended by any inconvenience except such as arises from their numbers and bulk. The number of masses thus formed is often amazingly great ; thus, in one of R. W. Smith’s cases, described in a mono- graph which contains the fullest and most accurate account of this disease, he counted in the two lower extremities alone more than 250 of these tumours, besides those in other parts of the body. In another case related by him, there were upwards of 200 small neuromata scattered over the sides of the chest and abdomen, 450 on the right lower extremity, and upwards of 300 on the left; altogether probably not less than 2000 of these growths in “ this impre- cedented case.” Stiiucturb.—The single nem'oma is composed of a white or greyish fibrous mass developed in the neurilemma, and having nervous filaments stretched through or over it. The nervous trunk above and below the tumom- is normal; it is only where it comes into contact with the neuroma, and is exposed to its pressure, that it undergoes the change indicated. Traumatic Ueuromata may arise from the wound or partial division of nerves, and occasion the most intense agony. Sometimes growths of this description of a fusiform shape, and varying from a cheny-stone to a pigeon’s egg in size, are met with in stumps after amputations ; in many instances they are unattended by inconvenience, but occasionally give rise to very severe pain. Treatment.—The treatment of painful neuromata, whether of an idio- pathic or traumatic character, or existing in stumps, consists in their excision. After removal, the part supplied by the nerve, Avhich is usually necessarily divided, becomes paralysed for a time, but may eventually regain its sensibility. In some cases, however, by cautious dissection, the tumoiu’ may be removed from the nerve that is in contact with it, without cutting this across. This has been done in the case of neuromata of the sciatic nerve and its di’vdsions. When these tumours are numerous, they should not be interfered with ; and, if unattended by pain, they need not be excised unless their bulk prove inconvenient. TRAUMATIC PARALYSIS. Traumatic paralysis is referable to four distinct sets of causes. First, it may aiTse from Coinpresdon of the Brain, giving rise to hemiplegia or more general paralysis, according as to whether the cause of pressure be confined to one side, or extend to the brain-substance generally, so as to injure or infiuence it more Avidely. Secondly, it may arise from Injimj of the Spmat Cord, giving rise primarily or secondarily to lesion of the substance, either by laceration, com- pression, or ultimate disintegTation ; paraplegia of the parts below the seat of injury being the result. Thirdly, Pressure on Nerves at any part of their course, from their roots to the terminal subdivision of their trunk, may occasion paralysis of the parts supplied by them. Fom-thly, Section of a Nerve will necessarily destroy all sensation and motion in the part to which it is distributed. From ivhatever cause it arises, traumatic paralysis may present every possible amount of diminution of nervous power, fr-om the slightest9or TRA UAFATIC PARALYSIS. impairment of sensation or of motion in a limb, to complete annihilation of both. But not only does the actual degree of loss of sensory or motor power A ary gi'eatly, but the relative degree of impairment of sensation and of motion is equixlly variable. In the great majority of cases both are tolerably equally affected. But, in not a few instances, the diminution of one far exceeds that of the other. Thus the motor power may to a great extent be lost in a part, whilst sensation appears to be normal. But this is often more apparent than real; for a diminution of motor power, however trifling, is at once perceived ; whilst an impairment of sensation, even though considerable, may long escape detection, hlence it is that motion seems to be more frequently lost than sensation, though the latter may be equally impaired. A person who suffers from a slight degree, hoAvever trifling it may be, of impairment of motion or of want of harmony between the action of the muscles of a part, may not be conscious of this while at rest, but it manifests itself unmistakably when he brings the part into movement,- whilst neither he nor others may be capable of observing the cor- responding loss of sensibihty unless it he most minutely and accmately tested. But not oidy may sensation and motion, one or both, be impaired or lost, but the more complete loss of one of these may be associated with an exaltation of the other. Thus there may be loss of motion in a part, with increased or nervous sensibility of it; in these circumstances, instead of being relaxed and soft, as is the case when there is anaesthesia, it is most commonly rigidly contracted, hard, and resistant, a species of nemalgic paralysis being developed. Or the converse condition may exist, and loss of sensation more or less complete may be associated with muscular tremor or spasm. 1. Paralysis from Compression or Injury of the Brain (vide Chapter XXIV.) may be occasioned by pressm-e primarily exercised on the sui’face of the organ, as by a portion of depressed bone, of clotted blood, or foreign body of any kind ; or it may arise, secondarily, as the result of inflannnatory efFusion, of softening and disintegration of the cerebral tissue, and consequent effusion of blood into its interior. It need scarcely be said that, the more a compressing cause is localised to one hemisphere, the more likelihood Avill there be of the paralytic symptoms assuming the hemiplegic character, affecting the side opposite to that injined. The more general the compression, and the more it implicates the base of the brain, the greater the probability of the paralysis being more or less general. So these forms of paralysis, when secondary or remote, depending on lesion of the brain-substance, of a disintegrating charac- ter, are often mixed up with many symptoms that point to the coexistence of chrome fonns of meningeal inflammation, and also a series of complex pheno- mena that are not vciy easily unravelled. 2. Those forms of Paralysis that arise from Injury of the Spinal Cord may either be primary, depending on its compression or section, or more or less complete destruction, as in fractures or dislocation of the spine, or its complete compression by mtraspinal meningeal haemorrhage ; or they may be secondary mid clue to more or less rapid and complete softening and disintegration of the cord, as the result of impairment of the nutrition dependent on changes due to inflammatory mischief extending to it from its membranes, originating in fr as the direct consecpience ofinjmy. In all these cases, the paralysis partakes ol the paraplegic character. The degree to which it extends mil iieLssarilyDISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 902 I dcpsiid oil tliG more or less complete involvement of the cord by the iiijiny, or the depth of its disintegration by disease. There may only he a very slight impairment or loss of harmony of motor power in the limbs, or there may be any increase of this impairment up to complete loss of all motion and sensa- tion in them. In many cases the sphincters of the bladder and anus are unaffected, or they may completely lose all controlling power. These forms of paralysis often afiect the two lower limbs very unequally, both as to the extent of the loss of sensation and motion, and as to the impaiiment of one power rather than the other in one or other of the extremities. The symptoms A'ary from a simple drag of the foot, with no appreciable loss of sensation, to complete inability to walk or even to stand, and to absolute insensibility to the applica- tion of the most powerful galvanic stimulant. These forms of spinal paralysis,, when arising primarily from injury to the vertebral column, more particularly from its fracture, are often associated with intense neuralgic pains, which dart along the line of junction between the sound and paralytic parts ; when they arise from secondary inflammatory afiections of the cord, they may be attended by the various symptoms indicative of myelitis, whether in the acute or the subacute form, such as spasmodic dra-wing up of the great toe, cramps in the legs, or neimalgic darting, with abnormal modifications of sensation through the limb. 3. Pressure on a Nerve at some part of its coiu’se, between its origin and the termination of its main branches, is a frequent cause of local traumatic paralysis, often of a somewhat transitory character. A famihar instance of this is afforded by the loss of power, both sensitive and motor, that is often noted in the hands and arms of people using and leaning heavily on crutches. The same partial paralysis frequelitly accompanies certain forms of spinal injiu’y, more especially wrenches or twists of the vertebral column, causing effusion into the structures that siUTOimd the nerves on their escape from it, and thus inducing compression of their trunks closely to their origin. The three nerves that are more commonly affected in this form of traumatic para- lysis are the Sciatic, the Circumflex, and the Musculo-Spiral. Tranmatic paralysis of the sciatic nerve is commonly the result of sprain of the spine in its lower part. In it the whole nerve is rarely, if ever, implicated ; but the loss of inneiwation, motor or sensory, is usually confined to one of its principal subdivisions : most frequently the external popliteal is the one affected. In consequence of this the foot is drawn somewhat inwards, di-ags on its outer side, cannot be properly everted, and thus the patient acquires a peculiarity of gait which is very characteristic. In walking, he does not advance the foot as far as the sound one : he brings it forward Avith a rotatory movement, efravung or dragging the foot along the outer edge and heel. The limb generally is weak, the patient being unable to stand on it alone; and most commonly it is the seat of neiualgic pains or of referred sensations of an intermitting natiue. Traumatic paralysis of the circumflex nerve, giving rise to loss of power in the deltoid and teres minor muscles, leads to a peculiar condition of the shoulder, that presents such very marked sigus, taken collectively, that it cannot well be mistaken for or confounded vith any other state. In consequence of some slight injury of the shoulder, a stiaiii oi tvist, alUIEUMATIC PARALYSIS. 9°3 severe pain is cxi^erienccd about the joint, followed by inability to use it freely. This disability increases until at> last the arm cannot be raised from the side, whilst all the movements of the elbow, Ibrearm, and hand, are perfect. On examining the shoulder, the following conditions will be found 1. Atrophy of the deltoid to a greater or loss extent; 2. Flattening of the posterior part of the deltoid ; 3. Increased projection of the acromion ; 4. The head of the humerus is thrown forward and somewhat inwards on to the inner edge of the glenoid cavity ; 5. The brachial terminations of the greater pectoral muscle will be found to be very tense and unyielding. All movements about the shoulder, except those in a forward direction, are lost. The condition usually occiu’S in delicate people of lax fibres. The atrophy of the deltoid is the primary condition, dependent probably on loss of power in the circumflex. In consequence of the loss of contractile poAver in the muscle, its antagonists and the pectoral especially are thrown into undue contractions. The consequence is, that the head of the bone is dragged forwards and subluxated. The Trcaiment consists in first reducing the subluxation of the bone under chloroform ; and after this has been done, in restoring the action of the deltoid by friction, douches, and galvanism. The signs of paralysis of the rmisculo-spiral nerve, either as affecting its trunk or its primary subdivisions, have been so fuUy given at p. 415, that they need not be described here. They are necessarily the same in character, though they may vary in degree, whether associated with fracture of the humerus or not. 4. Traumatic paralysis from section of a nerve has been described at p. 339. Dicif/nosis.—The diagnosis of these various forms of paralysis presents nothing that need at present detain us, as it is necessarily dependent upon, and in a great measure connected with, the cause of the affection—whether cerebral, spinal, or local. There is, however, one form of paralysis that is occasionally confounded "with the tranmatic varieties, more especially with that affecting the sciatic nerve, viz., the rheumatic. Rheumatic Paralysis is a form of disease more fr’equently spoken about than met Avith—that is to say, if we apply the term paralysis to loss of nervous power independently of inability to use the limb from muscular weakness, rigidity, or pain, or from similar conditions connected with the joints. Yet there can be little doubt that rheumatic paralysis dependent on loss of nervous power really does exist; thus it commonly arises from cold in the facial nerve, and occasionally in the sciatic and its branches. It is difficult to assign a distinct pathological cause for it : most probably it is due to compression of the nen'e by effusion within and around its sheath. It is of importance to distinguish it from paralysis arising from other causes more particularly from the traumatic forms. This may usually be very readily done by attending to two points : 1, that in the rheumatic paralysis Ave have, as a rule, co-existing or antecedent, an articular rheumatic affection of a chronic form^; and 2, that in the rheumatic form of the disease the electric irritability of the muscles is not diminished, Avhilst in the spinal and local forms it is materially diminished, or may be, indeed, entirely absent.DISEASES OF THE FERVOUS SYSTEAL 904 TETANUS. Tetanus is a disease consisfciug essentially m an excited state of the siiinal coxd and the medulla oblongata, in fact of the whole true spinal system, giving rise to painful and continued spasms of the voluntary muscles and the dia- phragm, a,lternating with incomplete relaxation, and usually terminating fatally. This, which is one of the most serious and distressing diseases to which the nervous system is liable, is in the great majority of instances of a Traumatic nature, being the consequence of some wound that implicates or irritates a portion of the peripheral nervous system; the local iiTitation so produced being propagated to and affecting the nervous centres, the excitation of which becomes persistent, and continues after the local cause has been re- moved, inducing reflex muscular movements in various parts of the body. The irritation of the nervous system, however, that induces tetanus, may arise from other sources besides surgical wounds, occasioning the Idiopathic form of the disease; thus, for instance, the presence of worms in the intestinal canal, exposm-e to cold and wet, the ligature of the umbiheal cord in infants, and even the uterine in-itation folloxving abortion, have been known to occasion it. These causes, however, rarely give rise to it in this country, and we must consequently regard it as a disease chiefly arising from traumatic lesion of some kind. Causes of Tetanus.—Tetanus may occiu at all ages, from the earhest infancy to an advanced period of life. In hot climates it is common amongst newly born infants, in the form of Trismus Neonatorum. In this country it rarely ocem’s at this very early period of hfe, but is common in young adults. I have most frequently observed it between the. ages of 16 and 25, and after that in old people ; but it may occiu at any period of life. It is'far more common amongst males than females—in the proportion of about fom’ to one. Season of the ycoir seems to exercise little influence over it. It occurs in all states of the atmosphere, and at all periods of the year ; but is certainly most common when the weather is suddenly changeable—alternating from heat to cold. Indeed, long exposure to cold and wet, more particularly after the body has been heated, is the most common cause of tetanus when it occurs inde- pendently of surgical injury, and is a fr’equent predisposing cause in persons who have been wounded. Tetanus may be occasioned by injuries that do not give rise to breach of sm’face ; thus I have known it occiu in a child who was suddenly thrown doivn upon its back by another at play, in a gul fr’om a boy jumping on to her back, and in a lad by another striking him on the back by running a wheel- barrow at him ; and Reid mentions a case produced by the stroke of a whip. But in the great majority of cases, it is directly occasioned by a wound of some kind. Generally a nervous twig has been lacerated, divided, or inflamed ; and this seems to have been the starting point of that distm’bance of the spinal system of nerves which leads to the tetanic spasms. The hind of loound, as well as its situation, doubtless influences materially the occiurcnce of the disease. Though it certainly more fr'equently follows punctured, torn, and lacerated, than clean-cut Avounds, yet it occasionally com- plicates these, even Aidien they are made in siugical operations ; thus, it has905 TETANUS IN MILITARY FRAG TICE. l)een known to follow tlie removal of the breast, amputation, the ligatui-e of the larger arteries, and tlie operation for hernia. The minor surgical opera- tions also are not free from the possibility of this dangerous complication. It has been observed after the operation for fistula in ano, the ligature of piles and ^-aricocele, the remo^’al of nasal polypi ; and I have even seen a fatal case resulting from the introduction of an issue. Bimns are peculiarly liable to be followed by tetanus. It is the common belief, both in the profession and out of it, that wounds of the hands and feet, and more especially of the ball of the thumb and of the great toe, are more hkely to be foUow'ed by tetanus than those in other situations. I think the truth of this opinion may be doubted ; though it is not improbable that tetanus may occui- more frequently after injuries of these regions than of other parts of the body, simply because punctiu-ed and lacerated wounds are more common here than elsewhere. It cannot well be supposed to be owing to the tendons and fascim that abound here, as Hunter imagined ; for it is seldom, if ever, met with after operations for tenotomy, which are so commonly practised on the feet. Tetanus may occur in aU constUutions—in the strong and robust, and in the feeble and emaciated. It is especially apt, however, to occm- in feeble and debilitated individuals, and, indeed, may be looked upon as a disease of debility; hence any condition that lowers the tone of the nervous system is especially likely to occasion it. When it occurs in persons who are otherwise strong and in the qjrime of life, it 'wiU be fomid that they have been exposed to causes of depression influencing the nervous system. It is loss of nervous tone, and not muscular weakness, that disposes to this disease. Thus, in tropical climates, as in some of the West ludiaTslands, and amongst the marshes of Cayenne, it occurs with peculiar fr’equency, the most trifling scratches or punctimes being followed by the disease. Poland, who has exhausted the statistics of tetanus, states that the mortahty from it is in London *025, whereas in Bombay it is 2 0 per cent, of the total deaths. It is interesting to observe, that the natives of hot climates are far more liable to this disease than Em’ojieans resident there. In militai'y practice tetanus is of common occurrence. Its frequency varies much in different campaigns and under different circumstances, season, and climate. In*the Peninsular War, it was estimated to occim in the proportion of about one case in every 200 wounded ; in the Schlesivig-Holstein war of 1849, according to Stromeyer, once in about 350 cases. In the Crimea it appears to have been of rare occurrence. Alcock’s estimate of one to every 4 9 wounded is evidently too high. After naval engagements, however, the mortality has often been high, more particularly if they have taken place in tropical climates. Sir G. Blane states that, after Eodney’s action in the West of 810 wounded 20 were attacked with tetanus, being one in 40. All European Army-Surgeons are agreed, that sudden changes from heat to cold arc amongst the most frequent causes of tetanus amongst the wounded Ihus Lairey states that, after the battle of Moskowa, although the number of wounded was immense, there were feiv cases of tetanus, the heat lieino- very great and continuous ; whilst after Bautzen, where the wounded were feft on 100 tetanus; and at Cl the Ixittle of Dresden, when great heat was foUowcd by much wet and cold, the wounded suffered most severely. So, after some of the Indian9o6 diseases of THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. ],)attlos, as Chilianwallah and Fcrozej)oro, where the wounded lay exposed to cold nights after very hot days (Macleod), tetanus was of very frequent occur- rence. The case appears to have been different in America, where' tetanus does not seem to have arisen from exposure of the wounded to cold and night- air. Chisholm states that although, from the v^ooded nature of the country in which the battles Avere often fought, Avounded men were not unfrequently left for two or three days on the ground, tetanus did not appear to be more frequent amongst them than in those immediately cared for. Hennen states that a draught of air, Avhether hot or cold, directly bloAAung on the patient, is the most fertile cause of tetanus. The frequency Avith which tetanus occiu’s varies much. It often happens that not one case occurs in a hospital for some years, and then several are met Avith in close succession or simultaneously. Period oe OccurrejSTCE.—Tetanus may take place at any period after the infliction of the wound that occasions it. In hot climates especially, it may occur very speedily ; thus, Eobinson relates the case of a negro servant in the West Indies, who scratched his finger with a broken plate, and died of tetanus in a quarter of an hour. It is very seldom, however, in temperate chmates, that it supervenes before the foiu’th or fifth day, usually from that to the tenth day. Larrey, who had great experience of this disease during Napoleon’s campaigns in Egypt, met with it most frequently between the fifth and fifteenth days after the infliction of the wound. According to the experience of the Surgeons of the Peninsrdar War, under whose observation many hundred cases came, the disease does not show itself after the twenty-second day ; but, though this may be the general rule. Sir G. Plane has related a case in which it took place as late as a month after the infliction of the wound. It is stated that it may occur after the cicatrisation of a Avound is completed ; when this happens, the disease must rather be looked upon as being idiopathic, acciden- tally occurring in a person who has been recently injured. Forms.'—Tetanus may be Acute or Chronic; being in some instances fatal in the course of a few hours, but usually lasting for three or four days. Poland states that at Guy’s 51 per cent, of the cases were fatal before the fifth day after invasion. If the patient survive this time, the disease will commonly Tim on to the eighth or tenth day, and occasionally even for a longer period than this ; thus, S. Cooper mentions a case in which it continued in a soldier for fi\'e weeks after amputation. The more chronic it becomes, the better is the chance of recovery ; indeed, if the patient survive the tenth day, the prospect of a faA'ourable issue to the case is materially increased. As a general rule, those cases are the most fatal which are most actNe in their symptoms ; the dano'er beinc in the ratio of the acuteness of the attack, both as to severity and also as to rapidity of invasion after injury. Symptoms.—The invasion of the disease is sometimes preceded by a general irneasiness on the part of the jratient, a feeling of iUness or Aveakness, or a sense of impending mischief. Abernethy was of opinion that tetanus was usualh ushered in by a disturbed state of the digestive organs, the stools being offen- siA’e and indicath’e of much gastric in'itatiou. When the disease sets in gTadually, it may be somewhat diificult of recognition in its early stages ; if it come on suddenly, its nature is immediately eAldent. It is a remarkable fact907 PATHOLOGY OF TETANUS. that the cramps do not begin in the part injured ; but, wherever this may be situated, they are always first noticed in the muscles of mastication, of the face, and upper part of the neck ; and throughout, these and the muscles of the respiration are principally affected. In tetanus, the circle of nervous disturbance is at first very limited. It is confined to the muscles supplied by the motor branch of the fifth, by the portio dura of the seventh nerve, and by the spinal accessory. These nerves aj^pear to be alone affected ; the sensoiy di^•ision of the fifth is ne’\'er influenced throughout the disease. The spasm may be confined to the muscles supplied by these neiwes, as is the case in trismus ; but it soon spreads to the true spinal nerves, being, however, confined to their motor divisions. The first symptoms usually consist in the patient feeling a stiflhess or soreness about the jaws and thi'oat, being imable to open his mouth widely, to take food or drink, the muscles about the temples, jaw, and neck feeling stiff and rigid ; this condition has given to the disease the popular term of JoeJe-jaw. As the affection advances, the countenance assumes a peculiar expression of pain and anguish, the features are fixed or convulsed from time to time, and the angles of the mouth dranm up, constituting the appearance called the rims sardonicus. When fairly set in, the disease is marked by spasms of the voluntary muscles of the most violent character, with much pain and only partial remissions. The pain is of that kind that attends ordinary cramp in the muscles, as of the legs, and is usually very severe. The spasms are often jerking, the patient being suddenly thrown up or twisted on one side; the breath is di-awn with a loud sobbing catch from spasm of the diaphragm, and ft-om the same cause there is usually violent pain experienced in the epigastric region, darting across to the spine. The muscles of the trunk are usually affected next in order of ft-equency to those of the head and neck, the body being bent backwards so as to form a complete scrok {Opisthotonos); more rarely it is drawn forwards {Emprosthotonos); and stiU less frequently to one side. In some cases the body becomes perfectly rigid, like a piece of wood, the beUy being drawn in, and the chest expanded. It is said that in severe cases the spasms have been so violent that muscles have been ruptured, teeth broken, and the tongue lacerated. In the numerous cases of tetanus that I ha'v e un- fortunately witnessed, it has rarely fallen to my lot to see any effects of this kind produced ; the spasms, indeed, being in general not very violent, though continuous and very painful. The only muscles that I have seen torn have been the recti of the abdomen. The intellectual faculties are not disturbed, and the mind continues clear to the last. Cases of tetanus occasionally prove fatal vdthout any elevation of temperature ; but in most instances there are great heat of surface, profuse sweats, and quickness of pulse ; not so much from any febrile disturbance, but apparently from the violence of the muscular contractions. In most cases this symptom is peculiarly marked, especially towards the end of the case, when the temperature may rapidly rise to extraordinary heights. Thus, Wunderlich has recorded a case in which it reached 112-55° Fahr. immediately before death, it may continue to rise a few tenths of a degree higher after death in these cases. The prolongation of life appears to depend gTeatly upon the intensity ot the convulsive movements : the more severe these are, the sooner does death result. Ihe fatal termination occurs not so much ft-om any great physical9o8 diseases of THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. lesion, or disturbance ot important parts, as from exhaustion consequent on the Irequency of the tetanic spasms. Pathology.—There is siu-ely nothing more remarkable in the whole history of disease than that, in consequence of a trivial wound inflicted on a distant part of one of the extremities of the body, an otherwise apparently healthy man should be seized with a spasmodic affection of the muscles of the jaws ; that this spasm should extend to the trunk ; and that after a few hours it should be followed by general convulsive movements which will, in the great majority of instances, speedily end in death. It might reasonably be expected that such a train of phenomena would leave the most unmistakable evidences of the con- ditions that had given rise to them ; and that pathological anatomy would at once, and in the clearest manner, enable us to unravel the mysterious bonds that connect a graze of the foot with a spasm of the muscles of the neck and jaAv. But in this we shah, be grievously disappointed ; for the morbid appeai-- ances found after death from tetanus throw but httle light on the real nature of this affection,—so little, indeed, that it is fr’equently looked upon as a “func- tional disease.” But in saying that this or any other disease is functional, Ave only express our ignorance of its real cause. There is no function Avithout an organ to perform it ; and there can be no derangement of a function Avithout a corresponding and concomitant disorder of the organ that produces it. Every “frmctional” disease must, therefore, at last be referred to an organic lesion. The term “ functional ” is only employed AAEen we are not acquainted with the true nature of the disease. As less is kuoAAm of the real physiology and pathology of the brain and spinal cord than of other organs of the body, we have more “functional” diseases of the nervous system than of the circu- latory or respiratory. But, as pathological anatomy becomes more studied, and as minute investigations into structure are entered upon, so the class of so-called “ functional ” diseases becomes narrower. We do not speak of “func- tional ” coma, because we can appreciate the different conditions that occasion compression of the brain ; but we stiU speak of functional convulsive diseases and of functional amaurosis. The ophthalmoscope, hoAvever, has shown that “ functional ” amaiu’osis does not exist, but that the failiwe of vdsual power is always accompanied by and dependent on some corresponding change of struc- ture in the interior of the eye ; and adA’ances in pathology AviU doubtless shoAV that other so-called functional diseases of the nervous system are in reality dependent on structmal lesions. State of the Nerves at the Seat of Injury.—There is one morbid con- dition that wiU, I think, invariably be found in tetanus, viz., a marked conges- tion and inflammation of the nerve connected with, and leading fr’om, the Avound that has occasioned the disease. This morbid state I have neA'er fomid Avanting. In all cases of fatal tetanus that I have seen in which a caretid dis- section has been made, the signs of inflammation of a nerve communicating Avith the Avound have been found ; and the vascularity, Avhich is often a ery intense, may be traced up the nemilemma, often to a considerable distance. In a case of tetanus following a Avound of the knee, in a patient AA’ho died in UniA'ersity College IIosj)ital, a small branch of the internal cutaneous nei’Ae Avas found to hav'e been injured, and Avas inflamed. In another patient A\ho died of tetanus about sixteen days after treading on a rusty nail, a black speck909 TREATMENT OF TETANUS. was found on the intcnial plantar neiwe, where it had been wounded by the nail. In a man who died of acute tetanus a week after rccei'vdng a lacerated wound of the dorsum of the foot, the digital nerves were found to be sloughy, and evidences of inflammatory in-itation extended some distance up the musculo- cutaneous nerve. In another case under my care, in which tetanus resulted from a bruise of the back, and terminated in death, the injured nerve (a dorsal branch) was found lying bare and reddened in the wound ; and, on tracing it up to the spinal cord, its sheath was found to be much injured, ecchymosed, and with a large vessel imnniug dovm it. In another instance, in which tetanus followed a wound of the -wrist, the external cutaneous nerve was found in a similar inflamed state. The Pathological Conditions found in the Spinal Cord in cases of tetanus have been studied by Kokitansky, Lockhart Clarke, Dickinson, and Allbutt. Rokitansky described them as consisting chiefly of a proliferous development of connective tissue, composed of young cells. Billroth doubts the coiTectness of this observation ; and many competent observers have failed to discover anything more positive than ecchymosed jDatches and interspaces in the spinal medulla. Lockhart Clarke has in at least six cases observed lesions of structure in the spinal cord, consisting of disintegration and soften- ing of a portion of the gi-ey substance of the cord, which appeared in certain parts to be in a state of solution. The fluid thus formed was in some parts gi-anular, holding in suspension the fragments and particles of the disintegrated tissue, but in many places it was perfectly pellucid. He considers this due to hypertemia of the cord, accompanied by exudation and disintegration. Dickin- son has described intense hypertemia vdth a structureless exudation poured out around the vessels in many parts of the grey matter, breaking do-wn the siUTounding tissue. He also observed some hemorrhages in the white columns. These observations have been confirmed by Clifibrd Allbutt, who found in four cords which he examined that the tissues were intensely congested, and suiTounded by spaces contaim'ng a structureless exudation, especially in the grey matter. The absence of any constant and distinct pathological lesion has led to the hypothesis of tetanus being dependent primax-ily on blood- poisoning, and not on a lesion of the nerve-centres. Bilh’oth, who inclines to this idea, admits that it is a mere hypothesis. This theory of blood-poisonino- being the primary cause of tetanus is based on the following line of argumenL A septic agent, capable of producing con-vulsive movements when absorbed into the blood—of acting, in fact, like strychnia—may be supposed to be generated in certain circumstances, whether of individual predisposition or of epidemic constitution, in the wound or at the seat of injury. We have the analogy of hydrophobia in support of the idea that, in certain circumstances, such an agent may be generated in the system, rendering the fluids blood and saliva—poisonous to others, and capable of developino- a con vulsive disease in the animal afi’ected. We have, however, no evidence as yet that the blood or any one of the secretions of a tetanic patient is capable when inoculated, of producing a similar disease in a healthy animal. There is one objection to this theory which appears to me too serious to be overlooked : viz., that tetanus has been an-ested, if not cured, by the division ot the principal nervous trank leading from the seat of iujmy, as the posterior910 DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. ^bial nerve in cases of tetanus arising from wound of the sole of tlie foot, his iact appears to me to point rather to a primary nervous lesion than to . , 1 xo lo uiuc LuaG, wnen once tetanic exefrement has been set up in the cord, it has a tendency to continue and to be incapable of removal by the mere abstraction or cessation of the local irritation, which gave rise to it in the fii-st instance. It is, however, only reasonable to suppose, that other treatment will succeed best if local irritation be removed ; and, indeed, so long as this continues to keep up the centric nei's ous disturbance, no general means can be expected to succeed ; as they wall have not only to combat afready existing disease, but also to overcome the continuous excitement maintained by the local disturbance. Hence it is of importance to bring the wound into as healthy a state as possible, and to see that it is clean, free from foreign bodies, and not inflamed. In order effectually to remove all local disturbance, recourse has been had to amputation; but though this may have succeeded in checking some of the more chronie forms of the disease, yet other and milder local means have sufficed equally well, and in the majority of cases it has had no effect, and hence so severe an operation can scarcely be recommended for adoption. The division of the trunk of the injured nerve, at some distance above the wound, if there be one that has been pimctiu-ed or lacerated, has occasionally j)roved successful. Thus, in a case of tetanus following injury of the supraorbital nerve, Larrey cut this across, and the patient was cured. In a midshipman, in whom tetanus came on the day after the sole of the foot had been wounded by treading on a rusty nail, Murray divided the posterior tibial nerve, and thus cured the patient. In those cases in which no special nerve appears to have been injured, Liston’s recommendation of making a A-shaped incision down to the bone, and above the part, so as to insulate it completely, may be advantageously foUowed. After the nerve has been divided, or the part properly insulated, some solution of atropine may be carefully applied to it, so as still fiu’ther to lessen local iiTitation. In the Constitutional Treatment of the disease, it is necessaiy to bear in mind that tetanus is an affection of debihty, the violence of the spasmodic paroxysms giving an appearance of false strength to the patient; and that the principal source of danger and death is the fatigue and exhaustion induced by the energy of the muscular movements. The means adopted should, therefore, have for their object the removal of irritation and the support of the patient’s strength, so as to enable him to hold up against the disease. Nothing can be more unsatisfactory than the treatment of the Acute form of traumatic tetanus. In it, all medicines are useless as curative agents. But, though medicines are of no avail as means of cure, they may act as palliatives, and afford relief to the jDatient ; and much may be done by the Surgeon, by removing all sources of external irritation, to mitigate his sufferings, and to place him in a favoiu’able condition to withstand the exhaustion, and to lessen the torture of the spasms. With this view, the first thing to be done is to clear the bowels well out with an aperient dose; aided, if necessary, by a tiu'pentinc911 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC TETANUS. enema. The patient shonlci tlicn be kept perfectly quiet in a room by biniBelf, a screen or muslin curtains, as recommended by Marshall Hall, being drawn round the bed, as noise or moA'cment of any kind increases the spasms greatly. In order to allay the spinal irritation, the most effectual means consists perhaps in the plan recommended by Todd, of applying ice along the whole length of the spine : this is best done by one of Chapman’s spine-bags. This is a powerfid depressing agent, and, unless care be taken, may lower the heart’s action too much, or indeed completely extinguish it. It may, however, bo applied Avith safety for six or eight hours, the condition of the patient being looked to in the uieamA^hile. Sedative or antispasmodic agents are of no use AvhatoA'er in acute traumatic tetanus. I haA'e seen many di-ugs of this kind emj)loyed, Avithout producing any effect in lessening the violence of the convulsions. In most cases, hoAvever, the inhalation of chloroform, or the administration of chloral, materially lessens their seA'erity, and gives the patient at least temporary ease. In the Suiacuto or Chronic form of the disease, recoA'ery is much more likely to take place ; and it is only in these cases that antispasmodics and sedatives have been of use, and in these also chloroform and chloral are far more beneficial than in the acute cases. There is a kind of trismus occm'ring in females, often of a hysterical natime, which is at once remoA^ed by the in- halation of chloroform. Almost every drug in the pharmacopoeia of a tonic, sedative, or antispasmodic natiu’e, has been employed in these cases ; and the recoA-ery which has occasionally resulted has been perhaps over hastily at- tributed to the remedy, rather than to the employment of those dietetic and hygienic means, which are of the first importance, by enabling the patient to live on until the disease wears itself out. Tonics, especially iron and quinine, have been employed by some. Elliotson was strongly impressed Avith the value of the carbonate of ii-on. Sedatives in all forms—conium, belladomia, opium, and their alkaloids—have been largely and most ineffectually employed! MiUer speaks highly of cannabis Indica pushed to narcotism, three grains of the extract, or thirty minims of the tincture, being given every half hour or horn ; and Haughton has employed nicotine in one-drop doses administered every second hour, Avith complete success in seA^ere cases of traumatic tetanus. The Calabar bean is the best remedy that perhaps desenns physiologicallv the most attention ; for, as it is nearly if not quite antagonistic to the tetanic spasms of strychnia. It may be hoped that it aauII be found equally useftd as a s^ative^to the spinal cord in those arising from traumatic causes. In E Watson s hands very successful results have followed its administration let It IS far from being a specific. I have tried it in several cases, Avith no appreciable good effect. It may be given by the mouth, hypodermically or Rev anum: m the form of a solution or a tincture of the extract in half-cmin doses, by the mouth; hypodermically, in doses of one-sixth of a grainper iniim,m gram-doses. The dose should be given at least every seLid hour ntd complete contraction of the pupil occurs. Stimulants, as h-andy should the same time be given to counteract the depression that mil result from e use of the drug. At the same time that recourse is had to rhoIi as these, it must not be forgotten that the disease is oii'e of great exhiustbii!912 DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. and that the patient will die worn out, unless he be sujoplied with jjlcnty of nonrishnient. Beef-tea and wine should, therefore, he administered by the mouth, as long as the patient can swallow, and nutritious enemata by the rectum ; and in this Avay the powers of life may be supported until the Tiolenco of the disease expends itself, I am, however, disposed to think that even in these chronic cases much more may be done by simple than by specific treatment. Clearing out the bowels by a turpentine enema, breaking the violence of the spasms and giving the patient rest and ease by chloroform inhalations or by chloral enemata, and keeping up the powers of the system by injections of beef-tea, egg, and brandy into the rectum, till the disease wears itself out, appear most likely to be followed by a satisfactory result, when used in addition to the hygienic measures recommended in the acute form of the disease. It is certainly more rational to employ such measures as these, than to be constantly recm-ring to antispasmodics and sedatives, which repeated experience has proved to be useless as curative agents, in the vain hoping of finding a specific for tetanus.913 INFLAMMATION OF THE LYMPHATICS. CHAPTER XXXIX. DISEASES OF THE LYMPHATICS AND THEIR OLANDS. INFLAMMATION OP THE LYMPHATICS. Inflammation of the Lymphatics, Lymphatitis, or Angeioleucitis, is a diflFase or ’erysipelcatous inflammation of the lymphatic vessels. In it, ac- cording to Tessier, the lymph coagulates, forming a rosy clot, which obstructs the interior of the vessel; the walls of which, at the same time, become thickened, softened, opaque, and surrounded by a quantity of infiltrated areolar tissue. Symptoms. This disease may be idiopathic, when it is closely associated with eiysipelas ; but more commonly it is set up from the irritation induced by an infected abrasion or wound. During the progress of an ordinary injury, the patient is seized with rigors, followed by febrile reaction, and attended, perhaps, by vomiting or dian-hoea. These symptoms often precede by twelve or fourteen hom’s the local signs of the disease, but more commonly accompany them. ^ On examining the part it will, if superficial, be seen to be covered by a multitude of fine red streaks, at first scattered, but gradually approximating to one another so as to form a distinct band, about an'inch in breadth, rimning from the part affected along the inside of the limb to the neighboui’ing lymph- atic glands, which may be felt to be enlarged and tender. The band itself feels somewhat doughy and thickened. Sometimes one lymphatic can be felt hard and isolated hke a piece of whipcord. There is usually more or less oedema of the limb, from^ the implication of the deeper layers of vessels and their ob- struction by the inflammation. Along the course of the inflamed absorbents erysipelatous-looking patches not unfrequently appear, and coalesce imtil they assume a considerable size, and constitute a distinct variety as it were of erysipelas In some cases the glands are affected before any other local signs manifest themselves owing probably to the deeper seated lymphatics havioo- been firat implicated; or possibly by the direct absorption of and deposit iS _ em of some septic matter that constitutes the primary source of the infective mfl^mation ; and not uncommonly throughout the disease the inflammation continues to be confined principally to this set of vessels, giving rise to o^-eat and brawny swelling of the limb, but without much if any siipeificial iXTs gradually subside into the asthenic fonn, •/ TP j The Diagnosis of inflammation of the lymphatics has tn Po mcri^ • cm phlebitis, the diagnosis is oas; hj attention to the supeLal reLss of 3 N914 DISEASES OF LYMPHATICS AND GLANDS. lymphatitis, and the absence of the cord-like plugged vein. From erysipelas, the absence of the diffuseness of the red hlush, and its limitation to the course of the inflamed absorbents, Avill readily serve as diagnostic signs. But into erysipelas the lymphatitis may ultimately run. From the pysemic it is neces- sary to diagnose the acute lymphatic abscess. This is usually easy; the lymphatic abscess being, if deep, solitary; if superfleial and multiple, confined to the tract of the previously inflamed absorbents : in either case being always between the starting point of the primary source of irritation or wound and the glands ; in the calf, thigh, or iliac fossa, if the primary imtation be* in the lower extremity, in the axilla or side if in the upper. The symptoms also indicative of prostration, of hectic, &c., are totally imhke those of true pyremia. Eesults.—The disease usually terminates in resolution at the end of eight or ten days ; not uncommonly it runs on to erysipelas ; and in other cases, again, locahsed suppuration may take place, sometimes in the form of one large deep-seated abscess in the upper part of the Hmb or in the thigh if the lower extremity, or under the pectorals and in the axilla if the upper extremity be the seat of irritation ; or a chain of abscesses may form along the course of the inflamed absorbents and in the glands to which they lead. In some instances, after the disappearance of the disease, a state of chronic and rather solid oedema of the part may be left, giving rise indeed to a species of false hypertrophy, and constituting a troublesome consequence ; more rarely, death results from more or less general blood-poisoning. This may assume the form of a local development of cellulo-cutaneous erysipelas, or may lead to genuine pysemia. If abscess form, irritative fever, with much wasting, ansemia and pallor may set in ; and death may ultimately ensue as the consequence of hectic and exhaustion. Causes.—The cause of inflammation of the absorbents is septic irritation introduced from without or generated by morbid constitutional states ; the disease is especially disposed to by atmospheric vicissitudes, by particular seasons of the year, more especially the early spring, and by the epidemic constitution at the time tending to disease of a low type. Broken health and the neglect of hygienic precautions also tend to induce it. Amongst the more direct causes are wounds of all kinds, but especially such as are poisoned by the in- troduction of putrid animal matters or other irritants, or that are of recent origin. It is very rarely indeed that inflammation of the absorbents ocem’s without some such external cause ; yet we are certainly warranted in consider- ing it as of idiopathic origin in some instances. I have at least seen cases in which careful examination has failed in detecting any breach of surface or evidence of poisonous absorption. Treatment.—In superficial lymphatic inflammation of the skin and in- tegumental structures, the local appheation of belladonna, as recommended by C.°Heath, is the most efficient agent in subduing the local action ; a paste of equal parts of the extract and of glycerine should be thickly smeared over all the inflamed parts, and followed by assiduous poppy fomentations ; the hmb at the same time being kept elevated. The bowels should be freely op^ned. It chronic indmation and oedema occm’, the appheation of bhsters will be found to be of use in taking down the swelhng and hardness ; bandaging, so as to compress the hmb methodicahy, may be of service in the later stages.915 INFLAMMATION OF LYMPIIATIG GLANDS. If abscesses form, these should be opened early, and treated on ordinary principles. INFLAMMATION OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS. Inflammation of the Lymphatic Glands, or Adenitis, may occur from the extension of inflammation along the course of the lymphatics; from the irritation induced by acrid or poisonous substances conveyed along these vessels, and not inflaming them, but inducing diseased action in the glands through which they arc carried ; or as a consequence of strains resulting fi’om ovei-exertion, as is often seen in the glands of the groin ft’om walking too much. In whatever way occurring, inflammation of the absorbent glands is always attended by a stasis of the lymph, with coagulation of it; and, if the whole or greater part of the glands of a limb be affected, the course of the fluid through the absorbent vessels may be so seriously interfered with, that oedema, often of a sohd character, occius in the lower parts from which the lymph ought to have been conveyed. Varieties.—Adenitis may be acute, subacute, or chronic. In Acute Adenitis, which almost invariably occurs as a consequence of angeioleucitis, there are pain, swelling, tenderness, and stifihess about the affected glands, with a dull, heavy sensation in them, followed by all the signs of acute abscess, the glands gi’aduaUy softening in the centre, and the suppurative inflammation extending to the contiguous areolar membrane, through which it becomes somewhat difiused. In Subacute Adenitis, which is a common result of injuries or strains, the glands become swollen, enlarged, and tender, and are matted together by the inflammatory and plastic consolidation of the neigh- bmmng tissues. If abscess form, it commonly commences in the structures m’oimd the glands ; and these are perhaps eventually exposed at the bottom of the cavity that results. This is especiaUy apt to happen in cachectic and stnimous persons from shght somnes of irritation. Very commonly, in such subjects, the inflammation of the glands runs into a Chronic state ; which, indeed, may at last terminate in their pennanent enlargement and indiuation' or in tuberculous degeneration. When the glands become chronicaUy inflamed from the &st, they are enlarged and hardened, with tenderness and pain about tnem after a tune suppuration takes place within them ; or perhaps it may occiu in the areolar tissue around them, which, breaking down, leaves them in e fonn of reddish-grey or fleshy masses, that protrude in the midst of the suppurating cavity : as the inflammation subsides, the skin becomes of a re IS - lie or purple hue, is thinned, and fii-mly incorporated with the sub- jacent tissues. of Gla.ncU.-The glaitls not micommonlr diseo^e or simply as the result of strumous e “arced of St™™ pemanently Lto mheShf “ .‘O'- mooas or years, may slowly break dotm 1 suppuration, leaving the skin thin, blue, and undimiued with nSu “““ m-eonditi’oned. .ui ciu firoDaoiiity^ the peculiar enlargement and tendeurv fn nni-mnuu ration arise from the d^t of «ous matter Tel' changes pr.no,pally occur in the neck, especially in the su^y ^^lids 3 N 2DISEASES OF LYAIPllATICS AND GLANDS. 9i6 ! and the glandulaj concatenatce, sometimes in the axillary or inguinal glands, forming largo indurated and nodulated tumours matted together, and suppura- ting in the interstices of the areolar tissue, or in the substance of the glands themselves. This strumous enlargement of the glands occurs chiefly in children and in young people ; in whom, indeed, it is commonly looked upon as one of the most frecjncnt accompaniments of the strumous diathesis. Treatment.—The treatment of inflamed absorbent glands varies greatly, according to the stage of the affection. In the acute stage, leeches and fomen- tations are especially required. In the subacute condition, spirit-lotions con- taining the iodide of potassium will subdue the inflanmration and take down the swelling ; at the same time, the health must be regulated by aperients, and a moderate antiphlogistic plan of treatment. If an abscess form, it must be opened with a knife, and the part well poulticed afterwards ; the fistulous openings, w^hich are often left, require to be treated by stimulating applications, especially the nitrate of silver, but very commonly they will not heal unless they are sht up and dressed from the bottom. Chronic Inflammation with Hypertrophy of the Lymphatic Glands,, or the indication left as the result of the acute disease, requires to be treated on different principles. If there be any pain and tenderness about the glands, the appheation of the iodide of potassium aud spirit-lotion will be required. If they have already suppicated, and an aperture exist leading down to an indurated mass, or if there be surrounding induration of the soft tissues, it is often a good plan to rub the ulcerated part freely with caustic potash, which ivill dissolve it away by exciting inflammation around the plastic deposit, and thus causing its dissolution into pus. When there is merely chronic enlarge- ment, without u’ritation, methodical friction with iodine or iodide of lead ointment wiU produce absorption of the inflammatory effusion constituting the bulk of the enlargement ; and this in many instances may remove the tumom- entirely. In other cases, painting the part with the tincture of iodine, and improvement of the general health, will cause the removal of the diseased structure. After abscess has formed and been opened, fistulous openings wU be left, into which large masses of hypertrophied gland may be seen to project. These are best reduced by the red oxide of meremy, or potassa fusa : indeed, if the glands be much enlarged and indurated, projecting into the openings made over them, the potassa fusa is the best application that can be made use of, breaking down and dissolving away the indurated mass. In applying it, care must be taken that the caustic do not spread too widely ; this may usually be avoided by coating the surrounding integuments ivith collodion. Extirpa- tion of enlarged lymphatic glands is seldom necessary, and, if undertaken, may lead to more serious and extensive dissections than might appear at first requisite ; for a chain of diseased glands often extends to a considerable dis- tance, and after one has been removed, others, come into sight. As a genera rule, this operation should not be undertaken : cases, however^ occasiona y occur, in which such a procedme may be deemed advisable, the aftected glands being large and indurated, and their disease of many years’ standing ; tlieir extirpation may then be proper, and I have not iinfreqiiently la occasion in such circumstances to remove them from the axilla, fiom t le su maxi ary region, and from the posterior triangle of the neck.LTMPIIADENOMA. 917 When the strumous diathesis is well marked the constitutional treatment recommended in the Chapter on Scrofula and Tubercle must be employed. The lymphatic glands occasionally become much enlarged in the neck, axilla, and groin without any indications of struma, but attended by much debility, and usually great emaciation ; in these circumstances, the best remedies are liquor potassm in* full doses, iodide of iron, and cod-liver oil. OTHBK DISEASES OP LYMPHATICS AND THEIR GLANDS. Lyjiphadenoma, or, as it is also called, Simple L3rmphoma or Hodgkin’s disease,” is a tumour composed of a tissue exactly resembling the cortical part of a lymphatic gland—the so-called “ adenoid tissue of His.” It usually gi-ows from pre-existing lymphatic tissue, and the situations into which it most commonly comes under the observation of the Surgeon are in connection with the lymphatic glands of the neck, axilla, or groin. These tumours arc also not uncommonly found in the upper part of the pharynx, growing fr'om the lymphatic follicles in that region. They may be single, and are then usually of considerable size ; but they may affect all the lymphatic glands, the liver, spleen, kidneys, &c., at the same time. This condition may be accom- panied by an excess of white corpuscles in the blood, constituting the disease known as leucocythmmia ; or this symjitom may be absent, constituting the disease described by Trousseau under the name of Adenie. The enlargement is not accompanied by pain or inflammation. These tumom-s may vary in size from a miUet-seed to a foetal head. Several such tumours may imite together, forming a single mass ; if situated in the neck or in connection with the bronchial glands, they may cause death by pressure on the trachea. They are usually well defined ; but they ai-e described by Billroth as occasionally invading the sm-rounding tissues, then forming the so-called malignant lymphomata. Such cases are always fatal by marasmus and anemia. Bilh’oth describes lymphoma as occurring also in tissues not belonging to the lymphatic system, as in the jaw, scapula, and areolar tissue. Structure—In the lymphatic glands, lymphadenoma resembles simple hyper- trophy ; but on section it will be found that all distinction between cortical and medullary parts is lost, the whole mass being composed of tissue resembhng the cortical part. On section, lymphadenoma much resembles medullary cancer ; it is soft, gi-eyish in colour, with spots of red, due to ha3morrhages or dilated vessels ; and opaque or cheesy spots may be scattered through it. It yields a juice on scraping, like cancer-juice. The juice obtained by scraping a lympha- denoma IS found, with the aid of the microscope, to be composed of innumerable round cells, ha,\*ing the size and appearance of lymph-corpuscles or the white corpuscles of the blood. On examining the tumour by means of sections made rom hardened specimens, a delicate reticulate stroma is seen, the meshes of which are iiUed with the cells found in the juice ahove m^itLT ^ Stroma can only be seen clearly by washing out the cells, either by shakiim the section m water or brushing it with a camel’s-hair pencil. (Fig. 288.) ^ Ihe Causes oi lymphadenoma are very obscure. It affects both sex4 and is chiefly nret with in young adults.

(lamp localities to those various conditions, indeed, that necessarily lead to deteriorated health and imperfect nutrition. The Diagnosis of these tumours, when in the lymphatic glands, from chi’o- nicaUy inflamed glands, is impossible in the early stages. It is only when their power of continuous and multiple growth becomes apparent that we call them lymphadenomata. The Treatment of lymphadenoma is in the highest degree unsatisfactory: Iodine, often applied locally in a routine manner, is absolutely useless, and no other external application appears in any way to promote the absorption of the mass. The constitutional treatment resolves itself into the employment of measures to combat the anmmia, and improve the nutrition of the system. With this view, iron, cod-liver oil, and continuous residence in bracing health- resorts, are serviceable. The question of the removal of the mass by operation must be discussed. If the tumour be large and single, or composed of an agglomeration of multiple masses, and so situated that it can be taken out with safety, its removal is proper, and should be practised. I have several times removed large lympha- denomata from the axilla and upper part of the neck with great advantage. Even when the disease is multiple, single large masses that are sources of special trouble should be dissected out. In one such case atumom’, which was as large as a fist, was removed, in University College Hospital, from the axilla. The patient, a delicate woman, had a group of similar growths in the neck, which had remained stationary for twenty years. Elephantiasis op the Legs and Sceotum.—Elephantiasis Ai-abum, or. Fig. 331.—West Indian Elepliantiasis. as it is often called, the Barbadoes leg, is an affection that is common inELEPHANTIASIS. 919 many tropical countries, in the West Indian Islands and in South America more particularly. It is met with, though comparatively rarely, in Europe. The disease usually affects one of the lower extremities (seldom both), the scrotum, or the labia, which may become enormously enlarged and hyper- trophied. In the face it is often met with ; in the upper extremities rarely. It is not my intention to enter into an account of the history, the symptoms, or the causes of this remarkable malady. It is sufficient for my purpose here to say,' that it appears to consist in disease primarily seated in the lymphatics. The glands, as Virchow and Eindfleisch suppose, become impervious to the transmission of lymph, and the hyperplastic deposits that characterise the disease are the consequence, together with the general stretching and hypertrophy of the integumental structure, of the plastic effusion into the areolar tissue. Treatment.—When this disease attacks the face, little, if anything, avails in the way of treatment. When it affects the labia and scrotum, the enlarged and diseased part must be removed. But when the leg is affected, surgery can effect much in the way of cure. In the slighter cases much may be done by eleva- tion of the limb, methodical bandaging, and perhaps, as Eayer and Lisfranc recommend, the employment of scarification. But in the more severe cases, where the hmb has swollen to a monstrous size, and has become shapeless from the groin to the ankle, the skin sallow, covered with nodules and overlaid by a branny desquamation, with a tendency to unhealthy and incurable ulcerations —^in these advanced and serious cases, more active measures are necessary. Dufour seems to have been the first to propose diminution of the supply of arterial blood to the limb as a cure for this disease. This he effected by com- pressing the femoral artery by means of a kind of truss, and was successful in four cases. This practice of compression has since been successfully followed by Hill, Cockle, Vanzetti, and others. TABLE I. Talle of Ligature of Femoral Artery for Elephantiasis. SURGEON. SEX. AGE.

To Carnochan is due the merit of having recommended the hgatme of the femoral artery as a means of ciu’e in these cases ; and, in whatever way it acts, there can be no doubt of the excellent effects that have followed this method of treatment, little as it can be explained by the received pathological views of the disease. In some instances, as by Bryant, Buchanan, and Simon (of Heidelberg), the external ihac has been advantageously tied. The operation on this artery has the recommendation not only of being completely above the limits of the disease, and consequently in parts that are quite healthy, but also of more completely controlling the nutrition of the limb than can be done by ligature of the superficial femoral. The result of the operation appears to have been fairly encom-aging in a certain number of cases, though in a large proportion it is evident, by the above Tables, that little if any improvement took place. Much doubtless depends on the real nature of the disease—whether true elephantiasis, or simple enlargement of the limb from the deposit of lowly organised plastic deposit of a less specific character. The latter probably undergoes absorption, when the nutritive supply of blood has been cut olf, much more readily than the former. Varix of the Lymphatics has been occasionally met with, both in the superficial and deep networks and in the lymphatic trunks. The part most commonly foimd affected has been the inner side of the thigh ; but the diseaseVARIX OF THE LYMPHATICS. 921 has also been seen in the anterior wall of the abdomen, about the ankle and elbow joints, and on the prepuce. In the superficial lymphatics, the varix first appears in the form of small elevations, giving the skin an appearance which has been compared to the rind of an orange ; it subsequently takes the form of little vesicles covered Avith a thin layer of epidermis. Varix of the larger lym- phatic trunks frequently accompanies the condition just described. The vessels may either be dilated cylindrically into round beaded enlargements, often semi- transparent, and but slightly compressible ; or ampullae may be formed on them, giving rise to more or less soft SAvellings, fluctuating under the finger. There is some oedema, attributable either to obstruction of the lymphatics or to the impeded floAV of the lymph. In 31 out of 55 recorded cases, a discharge of lymph (Lymphorrhcea) has been observed. This has also been seen to occur without varix, as the result of w'Oimd. In the latter case, the flow is continuous; while in the lymphorrhcea Avhich attends varix, it is to some extent intermittent. The identity of the fluid dischai-ged vuth lymph has been estabhshed by chemical and microscopic examination. An excessive discharge of the fluid is liable to produce symptoms of general debility, of the same kind as those induced by hasmorrhage. Treatment—Spontaneous cure of lymphatic varix has been observed in cases Avhere the penis was affected, the disease being the result of the obstruction to the flow of lymph caused by buboes. In other instances, various plans of treatment have been tried, with apparently indifferent result. Caustics have been used by several Surgeons, but, as the disease is often deeply seated as Avell as superficial, with but little result. Beau treated three cases successfully by introducing a seton into the dilated lymphatic vessels, and exciting adhesive inflammation. B. BeU advises ligature of the lymphatic vessel from which the discharge of fluid takes place. Compression by means of a bandage has been recommended by N^laton. Besides the diseases of the lymphatics and those glands here described, other pathological conditions have been observed. Thus, the glands may undergo cancerous degeneration as the result of absorption from a primary cancer ; and in other cases they have been found to have undergone calcification as the result of tuberculous degeneration, or chronic inflammation.923 DISEASES OF VEINS. CHAPTEE XL. DISEASES OF VEINS. PHLEBITIS. Inflammation of the Veins, originally studied by Hunter, has in later years attracted the attention of many distinguished Continental and British pathologists, amongst Avhom may be especially mentioned Breschet, Velpeau, Cruveilhier, Amott, Henry Lee, and Tessier. Phlebitis is of two kinds. Idiopathic and Traumatic. Idiopathic phlebitis will occur, independently of any external exciting cause, or perhaps from ex- posure to wet and cold, in one of the large yeins, almost invariably those of the lower extremity—the saphena, popliteal, femoral, or ihac. It most usually assumes the adhesive form ; and is most commonly met with in persons of gouty constitution. Traumatic phlebitis is commonly excited by the wound of veins, as in operations, venesection, and injiu’ies of various kinds; or it may resnlt from their contusion, or the application of ligatm’es to them ; and it is especially predisposed to by a previously unhealthy condition of the blood, by epidemic constitution, and by season—in fact, by those influences that dispose generally to the low and diffused forms of inflammation. It is sometimes adhesive, but not unfrequently diffuse, and is highly dangerous, being often the forerunner and the exciting cause of pysemia. To this variety of phlebitis may be referred the ordinary phlegmasia dolens and white leg of parturient women. Pathology.—When a vein is inflamed, important changes occur both in the coats of the vessel and in the contained blood. The coats generally become thicker, the outer one especially being vascular and infiltrated; the inner coat becomes softened, pulpy, and usually more or less stained of a dark-red or purple hue by the colouring matter of the blood. The blood in the inflamed vessel coagulates, and adheres to its sides ; this tendency to coagulation and adhesion being increased by the effusion of lymph from the wall of the vessel. This plugging of the vein appears to be due to two distinct causes, which may, however, be associated—one being inflammatory, the other embolic. When a vein has become primarily inflamed, a thin membranous layer of lymph is deposited upon its interior, closely attached to the lining membrane of the vessel; this thin expansion of exudative lymph attracts the fibrine ofTHROMBOSIS. 923 tlie passing blood, wliioh thus tends to become deposited on and to be incor- porated wtli it. The mass gi’ows by a process of aggregation until the whole of the vessel is filled for a distance of one, two, or more inches by this plug or thrombus—partly composed of exudative material, partly of coagulated blood. But there is another form of the disease, the Embolic, in which the vein becomes plugged in a different manner. In these cases, blood charged with minute granular embola, the result, possibly, of the disintegration of arterial thrombi (p. 721)', circulates through the body, and, passing through the capil- laries, arrives at last at some position in the venous system where, favoured by anatomical arrangement, previous disease of the coats of the vessel, or acci- dental constriction from position of a limb or part, the embolon separates itself from the circulating blood and becomes deposited on the inner surface of the vein, where it, in its turn, forms the nucleus of a thrombus, by which the vessel is speedily plugged. This thrombus may become broken up and dis- iutegxated. Embola may become detached from it, and, passing up to the right ventricle, may be driven into the pulmonary artery by the cardiac con- tractions, and, according as they obstruct its larger or its smaller divisions, may be the cause of sudden death or of some of those forms of intrapulmonic hsemon-hage that nsually go by the name of “ pulmonary apoplexy.” Thus embola formed in and starting from the left cavities of the heart, becoming disintegrated, may pass through the capiUai'ies into the veins, there to be de- posited, forming thi’ombi which, in their turn breaking up, yield fresh embola that may be productive of fatal plugging of the pulmonary artery, the plug making the whole of the circuit of the vascular system before it becomes de- structive to life. These changes may occur in any vein, external or internal, and we often find them associated—the same vessel containing a mixtime of coagulum and fibrine. The extent of siu’face which the inflammation may occupy varies fr'om that of a small vessel a few inches in length, to the trunk and branches of one of the largest veins in the body. The obstruction of the \ein, which is the common result of these forms of the disease, may continue permanently; the plug becoming incorporated with its coats, and gradually undergoing flbro-cellular degeneration, so that the vein is converted into an impervious cord. In other cases, a channel eventually forms through the axis of this obstructing clot, allowing the cu’culation through the vein to be re-established in a more or less imperfect manner. If the thrombosis and resulting embohsm be of a septic character, pyiemia and multiple abscesses, as has been fully described in Chapter XXXIII, will result. The difference between the plastic and the septic embolon is this, that the flrst^ leads to fibrinous deposits in the veins and internal organs, the effects of which are purely local, the other to disintegration of blood-clot, to metastatic abscesses, and pyjemia. S\]m.ptoms.—\xy phlebitis, the action is usually localised, and limited. Com- monly ^e disease is idiopathic, but it may arise from traumatic causes, and not unfrequently is subacute. IVhen traumatic, it may occur in any vein that IS wounded ; but, when idiopathic, it commonly occurs in those situated in the calf or leg, especially if they be varicose. The inflamed vein becomes hard, swollen, knobbed, and painful, the knobs constituting distinct enlargementsDISEASES OF VEINS. 924 tw if “ rcciaisli-pui-ple coloiii-; and thcio IS some degree of pam, stillhess, or inability to move the limb There may perhaps be no pain when the limb is at rest, but in some cases there are ly severe shocks ot pain, resembhng neuralgia, darting through the limb ■ <nncl m all cases there is deep tenderness over the course of the vessel There IS always some cMema around the inflamed i-ein, and in the part that supphes 1 with blood. This cedematous condition of the limb is a most important aiagnostic sigii in deep-seated embolic phlebitis when the vein cannot be felt <as in the pelvis, for instance), and may perhaps be the first symptom observed, coming on either suddenly or gradually. The oedema may give rise to a hard, white, and tense condition of the limb, which pits on pressure, though in some •cases the hardness is too great for this. Occasionally, in deep phlebitis, the limb may suddenly swell to a considerable size -without there being any subcutaneous oedema. In phlebitis of the deep veins of the leg and thigh, the calf of the affected limb may suddenly enlarge, with great pain and much distension of the superficial veins with fluid blood, but without any sub- cutaneous oedema. As the inflammation subsides, the swelling of the limb goes do-Rm, the circulation passing through its former channels, or the blood being carried off by the collateral venous system. If suppuration occur, no change takes place in the symptoms so long as the pus is localised or encysted. It may perforate the coats of the vein, and, passing into the external areolar tissue, form a common abscess. If it break through its plastic barriers within the vein, then a xqvj different result occurs, and the symptoms of pytemia come on. But, unless this occiu’, the constitutional disturbance in this form of phlebitis is very mild. Treatment.—The first point to be attended to in the treatment of obstructive phlebitis is absolute rest of the limb affected. The importance of rest in these cases is twofold ; 1st, to prevent pain and increase of local mischief; and, 2ndly, to guard against the danger that may result from the detachment of a thrombus, which, carried into the cimrent of the circulation, may occasion sudden death by plugging of the pulmonary artery, or more remotely fatal consequences by embolic disintegration and deposit in the lungs or brain. Much local comfort is derived from hot fomentations. The constitutional treatment must be conducted on ordinary medical principles, in accordance with the age and strength of the patient. As a rule, depletory measures are not well borne, and eaidy recourse must be had to a tonic or stimulating plan. The hardness which is often left after the removal of the inflammation may usually be removed by salt and nitre poultices, as recommended by Basham. If abscesses form, they must be opened. If oedema of the limb continue, the application of bhsters, or the pressure of an elastic roller, will remove it. But the hmb rarely, if ever, completely recovers its natural size. Diffuse Phlebitis has been described as an erysipelatous form of the disease, often running for a considerable distance along the lining membrane of the vein, which becomes thickened, pulpy, and red, without adhesions forming or the blood coagulating ; indeed, in cases of this kind there appeal’s to be a great want of plasticity in that fluid. This form of phlebitis is com- monly, though not always, fatal : its fatahty was supposed by Hunter to be owing to the extension of the inflammation to the heart, and by Hodgson to925 VARICOSE VEINS. the extent of surface affected ; but Arnott has shown that the inflammation scarcely ever reaches the heart, and that the extent of vein inflamed is com- monly very limited—it not unfrequently happening that the disease proves- fatal when but a few inches are affected, as in the vessels of a stump. But a more modern pathology has shown that death in these cases is invariably due- to pytemia. Symptoms.—The diffuse phlebitis is ushered in by the ordinary symptoms of pyrexia, at the same time that pain and tenderness, with a certain amount of oedema and hardness, may manifest themselves along the course of the inflamed vessel. These symptoms, however, speedily give way to those that characterise the lowest foms of ataxic fever—such as a fluttering pulse, a brown tongue, sordes about the mouth and teeth, Avith much anxiety of countenance, diarrhoea,, vomiting, extreme prostration, delirium, and death. The symj)toms are,, indeed, due to the fonnation of pus in the vein, its admixtm’e with the blood,, and consequent poisoning of the system. The whole danger and peculiarity of diffuse phlebitis depend, I believe, upon this circumstance ; and I Avould,. therefore, refer for the consequence and treatment of this form of the affection to the chapter on Pytemia (p. 709). In phlebitis there are two great sources of danger, viz., that of embolism leading to sudden death by the plugging of the pulmonary artery in the adhesive, and of pyaemia in the diffuse form of the disease. The Treatment of this form of phlebitis resolves itself into that of its secon- dary and important constitutional condition—the pymmia to which it gives- rise (p. 728). VABIX. By Varix, or Varicose Veins, is meant a dilated condition of these vessels,, Avith hypertrophy of their coats, gmng rise to oedema, tension, weight, and pain in the parts they supply—often Avith a good deal of numbness, difficulty in motion, or loss of power in the affected limb. In other cases, their pressure- on the neiwes of the part (as when the veins of the spermatic cord are enlarged) may give rise to very severe suffering. Appeaeajtcb.—Varicose veins are tortuous, dilated, and sacculated ; they are serpentine in their course, and feel thick under the Anger. They may be- superficial or deep-seated ; when superficial, the disease is often limited to one- of the larger venous trunks of a limb, the smaUer branches not being engao-ed. Phis Ave commonl}' see to be the case in the internal saphena ; in other cases the small cutaneous A'eins alone may be affected, appearing as a close network of a purplish-blue colour under the skin, with much discoloration of parts and some oedema of the hmb ; or both sets of vessels may be implicated. ' The- deep seated varix is not by any means so common as the superficial • and when It occurs, is generally the result of the pressure of a tumom- or of some similar cause. Varicose veins, especially Avhen superficial, are very ant to inflame, Avith coagulation of the blood Avithin their sinuses. Localita^—Ihe veins of the skin and the mucous membranes are those that are most liable to varix. It is most commonly met with in the legs, and more particularly in the trunk of the internal saphena ; but any of the snperfill920 I>JSEASJ<:S OF VEINS. "IT typogasfcrium, or thorax, may be affectccl. ^ The veins about the anus are especially liable to varix, constitutin<r some orms ot haemorrhoids; the spermatic veins, also, very often become enlai;g-ed, constituting varicocele. As a general rule, superficial varix is infinitely more common in the lower than in the upper part of the body oivine- evidently to the tendency to the gravitation of blood in the more dependent situations. ^ When occurring at any point above the pelvis, it may be looked upon as arising, in all probability, ft-om the pressm-e of a tumour of some kmd upon the large venous trunks. The deep-seated veins that are principally affected are, the internal jugulars, the vena azygos, and the veins of the prostate. Causes.—The causes of varix are generally swcA conditions as induce more or less permanent distension of the veins. Thus, for instance, strains, and habitual over-exertion of a^ part, by driving the blood into the subcutaneous veins, may give rise to their distension; so, also, certain occupations may favour gravitation of blood to the lower part of the body ; again, the length of a vein, as of the internal saphena, may occasion its dilatation by the weight of the long column of the contained blood. Any obstacle to the retm-n of the blood from a vein (as the pressure of a tight garter below the knee, or of a tumoui upon one of the large venous trunks) may give rise to its permanent distension, as well as to that of all its branches. In othei’ cases the affection, or the disposition to it, appears to be hereditary; and in many instances it is difficult to recognise any cause except an enfeebled and relaxed state of the walls of the vessel, such as is met with in tall, debilitated, and phlegmatic people. Age influences materially the occurrence of the disease, which, rare in the earlier periods of hfe, gradually increases in frequency as the individual advances in years up to the middle period of life Avhen the tendency ceases. In loomen, especially, the affection is common; in consequence, partly, of natural debihty, but more frequently from the pressme of the enlarged uterus during pregnancy. Steuctuke.—Varicose veins are sometimes simply dilated, without any thickening ; but in other instances they are truly hypertrophied, their cavities being dilated and their walls thickened—the vessel likewise being elongated, forming curves, and bending back on itself. Sometimes the enlargements at particular points appear to be multilocular, the vein forming a series of emwes and dilatations together. The valves are always insufficient in varicose veins, being usually bent backwards or ruptured ; and the lining membrane is marked by longitudinal strise. The blood in these vessels has a tendency to coagulate in large masses, the vein being at times the seat of inflammation, by which this tendency is materially assisted. The neighbouring and subjacent pai-ts are much modified in structure; and there is usually chronic oedema, with infiltration of the skin and areolar tissue, which may at last run into ulcera- tion—giving rise to the varicose ulcer, which has already been described (p. 170), and which, if communicating with a large branch, may yield a copious or even fatal hEemorrhage. The blood contained in the varicose knots and veins becomes more or less stagnant, and probably altered in its qualities, so as to render the vessels peculiarly liable to inflammation, and possibly even to injui’e the general health to a remarkable degree. Progeess.—Varicose veins never undergo spontaneous cure : Avhen onceTREATMENT OF VARICOSE VEINS. 927 formed, the condition is permanent, unless the vessel become plugged by coa- gulum, when, it being obstructed, the current of blood is diverted into other channels, which in their turn become varicose. The main evil that results from varicose veins in the legs, is the change that is slowly induced in the nutrition of the skin and subcutaneous areolar tissue by the retardation of the circulation, and the interference with the due return of blood. It is in consequence of the imperfect nutrition of the parts that ulceration of the skin takes place, especially where it is natmally thin, as about the ankles. But there is another condition that may occin- as the result of varicose veins of the legs, viz,, that the varix may give way, the vein may “ burst,” as is generally said. In these cases the word “ biu’st ” is scarcely con-ect. The varix does not give way by pressure from within ; but a process of ulceration goes on from without by which its coats become weakened, so that at last, it being unable to support the column of con- tained blood, a pin-hole aperture forms, which, rapidly enlarging, leads to the profuse htemorrhage. This so-called “ bursting ” of a varicose vein is never so sudden that a Surgeon may not foresee the probability of its occmTence. It may take place on the surface of an nicer, or it may be preceded by indu- ration, reddening, and thinning of the integuments covering the diseased vein. Treatment.—This must be conducted on two principles—to palliate and to cure. The Palliative Treatment consists in moderate compression exercised upon the vessel, so as to support its weakened and dilated coats, and thus prevent its fru’ther distension and the pain occasioned by this, as weU as the other consequences—such as oedema, disorganisation, and ulceration. The pressure must be apphed very smoothly and evenly, lest it irritate and ulcerate the sMn, or produce distension of the vein below the part compressed. For the purpose of compression, bandages and elastic stockings are commonly employed. In some cases, elastic pressure by means of a vulcanised India- rubber band or garter may be apphed around the limb, so as to simulate the action of the valves of the vein ; by compression it cuts off the weight of the cohunn of blood fr’om the terminal branches. In other cases, the appheation of a truss to the upper part of the saphena vein, as recommended by CoUes may be of service. ’ If a varix of the veins of the leg bm’st, violent bleeding may suddenly take place so as to induce faintness, and even death. The copiousness of the bleed- mg may be accounted for by its ocenmng from the cardiac side of the varix he insufficiency of the valves not presenting the ordinary obstacle to the ownward flow of blood. The treatment consists in laying the patient flat on the floor and raising his leg, when the haemorrhage wiU cease. It may be pemanently arrested by the pressure of a compress and bandage. n certam circumstances, it becomes necessary to change the palliative for a Cnratxve plan This is especially requisite in the following three conditions • if the varix be so large as to produce much inconvenience, or to give rise to everepam by its pressure on the nerves in its neighbourhood ; 2, if a varicose vein have burst, or be on the point of giving way • or 3 if in iilccv rfon ^ on its existaoe wiU not heal. Yarioi pla^ o/curative it recommendeci; all of whicli have for their object the obliteration of \bp ve'^ at one point by exciting adhesive inflammation there, and thus causing it928 DISEASES OF VEINS. cventnally to degenerate into a fibro-cellular cord. In this way the trunk of a varicose vein and the larger masses of varix may be occluded. But can the disease be cured by the local obliteration of the vein ? To this question, I have no hesitation in answering in the negative. Though the trunk be oblite- rated, a collateral venous circidation is set up, which is very apt in the course of a few months to take on a varicose condition, and thus to cause a return of the disease. But, though the cure be not radical, much benefit may often be effected by removing varicose knots that occasion pain or inconvenience, by enabhng an ulcer to cicatrise, or by occluding a vein from which hsemorrhage has occun’ed. The principle of all curative treatment in varix consists in exciting adhesive and localised inflammation in the vein so as to occlude it, and thus, by directing the blood into other channels, to relieve the distension of tbe diseased vessels and the inconvenient results that follow this. As the treatment thus necessarily involves the artificial excitation of phlebitis, there is always some little risk of the inflammation passing beyond the adhesive- stage into that of suppuration, or diffuse inflammation. Various plans for obliterating the veins have been recommended. They resolve themselves into five principal heads of treatment. 1. The subcutaneous section of the vein, or the excision of an inch or so of the vessel. This plan of treatment is severe and not unattended by danger, as we learn from Brodie. 2. It has been recommended by Mayo, Seutin, Bonnet, and others, to excite inflammation in the vein by producing a series of deep eschars or issues in the skin covering it, by the application of a caustic, such as the chloride of zinc or- potassa fusa. Skey speaks very favourably of this mode of obliterating varicose veins as being devoid of danger. He recommends the eschars to be made by the apj)lication of a powder, composed of three parts of lime and two of potash, made into a paste -with spirits of -wine at the time of application. The eschars should not be larger than a split pea, and their number must depend on the extent of the disease. 8. Others recommend the obliteration of the vessel by introdiicing needles- into it, and transmitting a galvanic current along and across them. Of this plan of treatment I have not had any experience ; nor do I believe that it is ever- employed by Siu’geons in this country. 4. Injection of the varix by a feiv drops of a sohdion of the percliloride of iron,. as recommended by Pravaz, is a very effectual method of prociu-mg coagulation of the contained blood and consolidation of the varix, more particularly if it be very large and cellular. In employing this means, it is better to com- press the vein by means of the finger or a pad and bandage above the varix ; the solution is then to be injected in very small quantity—not more than three or four- drops—by means of the syringe (which will be described in speaking of the treatment of nmvus), into the dilated veins. Coagulation of the blood immediately takes place. The patient must be confined to his bed for a fen^ days with the limb raised, and a bandage should be applied before he is allowed to walk about. This means is very effectual in large varix, and may in such cases be advantageously conjoined Avith the next method—the pins being used under the A^enous trunks, and the solution introduced into the dilated masses of the varix. But it is not devoid of danger : accidents, such929 TREATMENT OF VARICOSE VEINS. as local suppuration and slougluiig-, pya3mic symptoms, and even fatal embolism, have followed its use. 5. The most convenient and safest way of obliterating the vein in my opinion, and that which I always employ, consists in compressimj Urn vessel at several points, by passing a hare-lip pin underneath it, laying a piece of wax-bougie o-s'er it, and then applying the twisted suture ai’ound the pin and over the bougie (Fig. 3i)l«). In this way the vessel gradually ulcerates by the pressure that is exercised upon it, and the presence of the bougie prevents the ligature from injuring the skin. In performing this operation, care must be taken that the vein be not transfixed, but that the pin be pushed, or rather dipped under- neath it; the ligature should not be too thin, and must bo apijlicd tightly over the bougie ; several phis (as many as eight or ten, if necessary) should be intro- duced along the course of the same vessel, at distances of about three-quarters of an inch from one another (Fig. 332); those highest up should be put in first, and they should be left in for at least a week or ten days, by which time the obliteration of the vessel will have taken place. I believe that all the danger of the operation consists in the transfixion of the vein by the pin ; the operator may always know when he has done this by the escape of a few drops of venous blood ; when the pin is properly passed under and clear of the vein. the operation is a perfectly bloodless one. If the vein be transfixed, the pin should im- mediately be withdi-aAvn and passed at another point; if it be allowed to remain in the vein, as a foreign body, and suppima- tive phlebitis may ensue. Where the vein is properly compressed between the pin below' •and the bougie above, adhesive infiammation takes place in it, and it becomes oblitciated at the point of pressiu’e. By attention to these circumstances I have never met with any ill-consequences, either from suppui-atiA'e phlebitis •or pyaemia, in any of the cases in which I have performed this operation, which arc several hundreds in number. In addition to the application of the pins in the usual way, H. Lee has re- ■commended the subcutaneous division of that portion of the A'ein which is included between them, after coagulation of the blood has taken place. This I ha\e found to be an useful addition to the ordinary treatment, and to insiu-e the obhteration of the vessel. The points of the pins maybe prevented from pressing injuriously upon the skm, by putting small pieces of adhesive plaster under them. The pow'ers 3 o VOL. I.930 DISEASES OF VEINS. of the constitution should at the same time be improved, and the activity of the circxdation kept up by nourishing diet, tonics, and wine. Whilst the pins are in, the patient must not be alloAved to move about, and after they have been taken out, the limb should be bandaged for some time. In general, no idceration takes place about the pinhole apertures ; but occasionally, in debi- litated constitutions, a sore forms, which requires to be treated on ordinaiy principles. ^931 ANEURISM BY ANuiSTOMOSIS. CHAPTEE XLI. —♦— ANEURISM BY ANASTOMOSIS, AND NJEVUS.— HAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESIS. ANEURISM By ANASTOMOSIS. Aneurism by Anastomosis is a disease of the arteries, in which the vessels become excessively elongated, tortuous, and serpentine ; sometimes they assume a varicose condition, being dilated into small sinuses, and are always vexy thin-waUed, resembling rather veins than arteries in structure. This kind of dilatation of the vessels gives rise to pixlsating tumours, often of con- sidei’able size, and of a very active and dangeroixs character. They may be sitixated in almost any tissue or organ of the body, but are most commordy met with in the submucous and subcutaneous areolar tissue, and most frequently occm’ in the upper part of the body, especially about the scalp, orbit, lips, and face ; but they have been met with in other situations, such as the tongue, and even in internal organs, as the hver ; and I have seen veiy active growths of this kind on the side of the chest, nates, and foot. In some cases, aneiuism by anastomosis occiu’S in bones, in which it forms a special disease, and is not imcommonly associated with some form of malignant growth. It will generally be found that the arteries leading to the aneurism by anastomosis, though at a considerable distance from it, are tortuous and enlai’ged, with thin and expanded coats, and pulsate actively ; in fact, constituting that condition that goes by the name of Cirsoid Dilatation of the vessels. Aneurism by anastomosis fonns tumours of varying magnitude and iiTegular shape ; they are usually of a bluish colour, have a spongy feel, are readily com- pressible, not circumscribed, and have large tortuous vessels running into and from thern on different sides. Their temperatiue is generally above that of neighbouring parts ; and a vibratory or puiTing thrill, amoimting in many dases to distinct pulsation, may be felt in them. This pulsation or thrill is syn- chronous xvith the heart’s beat, may be ari’ested by compressing the tumoiu- or the artenes leading to it, and returns with an expansive beat on the removal of the pressure. The bruit is often loud and harsh, but at other times of a soft and blowing character. These growths rarely occim in infancy, but generally rr “let with at all penods 01 life, often as the consequence of injury.

In many cases the situation of tlie tumour at a distance from any large trunk, as on the scalp, the outside of the thigh, or the gluteal region, ’^^^ll determine this. Again, the outline of the growth is less distinct than in true aneurism ; and tortuous vessels will be felt leading to it from different directions. The swelling also is doughy and very com- pressible ; but, when the pressure is removed, the blood enters it with a whiz and thrill, not with the distinct pulsating stroke that is found in anem-ism. The pulsation, not so forcible as in aneurism, is more heaving and expansive. The bruit is louder, and more superficial, sometimes having a cooing note. By pressiu’e on the arteries leading to the tumour those signs are usually not entirely aiTested, though diminished in force, the blood entering it from the neighbouring parts, and in a less direct way. Treatment.—The treatment of aneurism by anastomosis must depend npon the size and situation of the growth. When it is so placed that it can be ligatured or excised, as on the lip, or when small, about the neck, face, or scalp, trunk, or extremities, it should be removed. I always prefer the ligature, applied as Avill immediately be described, as being the safest, and upon the whole the readiest mode of removing such a tumour. If excision be practised, it is necessary to be very careful to cut widely of the disease ; if it be cut into, fearful haemorrhage may ensue, which can only be arrested by pressine, and which in several instances has proved fatal. If the disease be very large and extended, as is commonly seen on the scalp, or if deeply seated, as in the orbit, neither ligatine nor excision of the tumour can be practised, and it becomes necessary to starve it by cutting off its supply of blood. This may be done either by ligaturing the p-mdpal branches leading to it, or the main trunlc of the limb or part. Simple ligature of the arterial branches leading to the tumour has never, I believe, been followed by success ; at least, in ten recorded instances in which it has been had recourse to, the disease has not in one instance been cm-ed. It has, however, been successfully conjoined by Gibson in two cases of aneinism by anastomosis of the scalp, with incisions made romid the tumour at intervals between the principal feeding arteries, which at the same time were tied. The main trunlc leading to the tumour has been ligatured in a considerable TmmbpT of cases. The brachial and femoral arteries haxe been tied for disease of this kind situated on the extremities, and in some instances with success ; but the carotid is the vessel that has been most frequently deligated, in con- sequence of the tiunour bemg commonly situated on the scalp and in the orbit. This operation has been done in twenty-three recorded cases, and in five instances both the carotids ivere ligatmnd at intervals of several weeks. _ In all of those cases in which the double operation was performed, the patients ultimately recovered. In some of the cases in which one carotid alone was tied, the disease, being seated upon the scalp, was not cured ; and it was after- wards found necessary to have recoinse to ligatm-e of the tumour, to excision, and to other means of removal; indeed, when seated upon the scalp, this disease appears to be more intractable than in any other part of the body, owino- probably to the freedom of the arterial supply from the numerous vessels that ramify in this region. Here, however, much benefit might be933 VARIETIES OF N.EVUS. clorircd after ligature of the carotid, by adopting the plan suggested by Gibson of tying the feeding arteries, and making incisions between them down to the bone. The ligature of the carotid has answered best for diseases of this kind in the orbit; of thirteen instances in which the arteiy has been tied for aneiu’ism by anastomosis in this situation, a cure was accomplished in the majority. N.ffiVUS. This disease, imder which are included those various affections termed Mother's Marks, Erectile Tumours, and Vascular Groiuths, constitutes an impor- tant and interesting section of surgical affections. It appears to consist essentially in an excessive development of the vascular tissue of a part, and differs greatly as to nature, cause, and treatment; according as the arterial, the capillary, or the venous elements of the tissue predominate. The predomi- nance of the arterial tissue we have already considered, under the head of Aneurism by Anastomosis; it now remains for us to describe the Capillary and Venous Nrevi. (See also Angioma, p. 758.) Ntevi may, and com- monly do, occur in the healthiest and best-formed children. But they are more apt to occiu’ in those who are the subjects of other congenital mal- formations. Capillary ITaevi appear as slightly elevated but flat spots on the skin, of a bright red or purplish tint, and ha^'ing occasionally granular or papiUated elevations, with some larger vessels ramifying on their surface. They often spread superflcially to a considerable extent; they are usually situated on the face, head, neck, or arms, but occasionally, though more rarely, on the back, the nates, the organs of generation, and the lower extremities. They are, I believe, always congenital, though often at birth very small, not larger than a pin’s head, from which they may spread in the course of a few weeks or months to patches an inch or two in diameter. In many cases no inconvenience results from this disease, except the deformity it entails ; but occasionally, more especially when the growth is at aU prominent, there is a great disposition to unhealthy ulceration. When bleeding occurs from a wound of the ntevoid structure it is usually in a trickling stream, and without any degree of force. Venous or Cavernous Naevi are of a darkpui’ple or reddish colour, usually very prominent, and often forming distinct tumours of considerable size, which may either be smooth and ovoid, or else somewhat lobulated. On'compressing a ^owth of this kind, it subsides to a certain extent, feeling doughy, soft, and inelastic ; and on the removal of the pressm*e Alls again. In some cases, when consolidated by inflammation, or containing cysts, it cannot be lessened in bulk by pressure. These nsevi are usually of about the size of half a walnut, but sometimes much larger. I have removed from the nates and the back some quite as large as oranges. They less frequently occur upon the head and face than the capillary form of the disease ; most of the instances that I have seen have been met with in the lower part of the body, about the nates, back, lower extremities, and organs of generation. Subcutaneous nasvi are occasionally of a mixed character, forming soft, doughy, and compressible tumours, capable of diminution hj pressm-e, on theNyEVUS. 934 removal of wlncli they slowly fill out again to as large a size as before ; they also become distended when the child screams or struggles, and are usually oval, smooth, and uniform. The skin covering the tumour is often un- affected ; at other times it is implicated in an oval patch on the most prominent part of the growth, and occasionally the surrounding veins are bluish and enlarged. Structure.-—CaifiUary nmvi appear to be composed of a congeries of small tortuous capillary vessels ; venous ntc'S'i appear made up of thin tortuous veins, dilated into sinuses and small pouches. In the midst of these masses, cysts are not uncommonly found, sometimes containing clear, at other times dark, sanguinolent fluid. These cysts are probably venous sinuses, the openings into which ha-^^e become occluded. (See also p. 759). Prognosis.—The natural history of ntevi has yet to be learnt—we have yet to ascertain what becomes of them when left to themselves. They are so commonly removed by operation, that hitherto Surgeons have had but few opportunities of determining this. I have, however, seen several cases in which fL’om various circumstances no operation had been performed, and I have been struck with the tendency that there is in the cutaneous naevus to disajDpear. If left untouched, or subjected to continuous pressine, islands or jiatches of white skin will gradually appear in the reddened sinface. These will slowly increase and coalesce, and then the mevus, becoming gradually less vascular, may in time disappear. Subcutaneous venous nasvi will sometimes gradually shrink, but the active erectile uaevus is pro- gxessive. There is usually a fear expressed of naevi, if left without surgical interference, leading to dangerous or even fatal haemorrhage. This I have never seen ; indeed, if the nmvus ulcerates its tissue hardens, and the vessels become blocked up by coagulum and plastic deposit. Treatment.—In the treatment of neevus, the first point to be detennined is whether the case should be left to natm-e, or whether operative measures should be had recom’se to. In deciding this point we must be guided by the size, situation, and character of the morbid growth. If this be small, cutaneous, and superficial, so situated that it occasions little or no disfigm-ement, and if it show no tendency to increase, it may be left without interference; when, as just stated, it may eventually shrivel and disappear, or become converted into a kind of mole. In some cases this process may be hastened by the ajDphcation of tincture of iodine or liquor plumbi. In other cases, again, the ntevus, though cutaneous and superficial, is so widely diffused over the surface, that no attempt at its removal or destruction can be entertained vlth prudence. But, if the nmvus be large, if it be subcutaneous, or if it increase in size, or if it be so situated as to occasion disfigmement, means must then be adojited for its removal by operative procedure. Operations for the removal of mevi may be conducted on five principles : 1, to excite adhesive inflammation in them, and so to produce plugging and obliteration of the vascular tissue of which they are composed ; 2, to destroy the gx'owth by caustics ; 3, to remove it by the galvanic cautery ; 4, to remove it with the knife; or, 5, to remove it by ligatme. Each ot these differentTREATMENT OF NJEYUS. 935 Ilians of treatment is peculiarly aijplicable when the disease assumes certain forms, and affects certain situations. 1. When the mevus is of small size, and occurs in such situations that its destruction by caustics, or removal by knife or ligatiu’o, would be attended by serious deformity, as when it is seated about the eyelids, upon the tip of the nose, at the inner angle between the eye and the nose, or about the corners of thb mouth, it is best to endeavour to procure obUteratmi, hj exciting adhesive inflam- mation in it. This may be done in various Avays. If small, the naevus may be vaccinated. If it be larger, the most convenient plan consists, perhaps, in passing a number of fine silk threads across the tumonr in different dhections, and leaving them in for a week or two at a time, until they have produced sufficient inflammation along their tracks, then Avithdrawing them and passing them into other parts of the tumoiu’. In this way its consolidation may gradually be effected. Another very useful plan is to break up the substance of the growth subcutaneously by means of a cataract-needle, or tenotome, and, in the intervals betAveen the different introductions of this instrument, to keep up pressm-e upon the tumour. In other cases, again, the requisite amount of cousohdation will be induced by passing acupunctm’e- needles into the nsevus, and then heating them by means of a spirit-lamp. Perhaps the most efficient way of obtaining this object is by injecting the perchloride of iron by means of a small glass syringe ATith a screw-piston rod and a fine sharply pointed platinum nozzle (Fig. 333). In doing tliis, care must be taken that but a very small quantity of the solution, not more than two or three drops, be injected at one time. The perchloride of iron possesses extraordinary power of coagulating the blood ; and, if more than has just been mentioned be thrown in, the tissue of the nmvus may either have its vitahty destroyed, aud slough, or coagulation of the blood in the vessels beyond the nffivus may occur, and a dangerous or even fatal embolism ensue from the coagulum thus formed being washed into the cuiTent of the circulation. 2. "When the nsevus is small, very superficial, of the capillary character, Avith an exceedingly thin covering of cuticle, aud so situated, as upon the arm, neck, or back, that a moderate amount of scarring is of little consequence, it may most conveniently be removed by the free application of ovitric acid. This should be well rubbed on by means of a piece of stick ; and, after the separation of the slough, its application must be repeated as often as there is any appearance of the granulations springing up, which occasionally happens at one angle of the Avouud and indicates a recmrence of the vascular groAi'^th. ’ 8. l-he (jalvanic cautery has been used in a large number of cases by con- itTt „"fTT of I" ISO cases tabLted by Maas ot Breslau, this treatment was completely successful in 112 Eleven were improved ; 3 died ; and the result in 4 Avas uuknoAvn.

There are two niotiiods hy which nmvi may be cured by the electric cautery; \iz., by electrolytic action, the ntevoid structure being gi-adually consolidated and thus removed ; and secondly, by the cauterising action of a platinum wire made red-hot. 4. ■^\hen the nmvus is large, constituting a more or less distinct tumour, and is of a somewhat venous character, it may occasionally be excised. Icale, junior, has shoAvn that some nmvi which are distinctly encapsuled may readily be dissected, or rather shelled out. Should the naevus, how- ever, be diifused, without any distinct limiting capsule, care should be taken to cut wide of the disease ; and no operation with the knife should be under- taken unless the growth be either so situated, as upon the lip, that the parts ma^ readily be brought or compressed together, or upon the nates or thigh, where it is unconnected with large blood-vessels, and is also very indolent and venous. If the naevus be arterial, or partake of the nature of aneurism by anastomosis, it should not be touched with the knife. It is especially when the nmvus is lipomatous or cystoid, or is distinctly encapsuled, that excision may be advantageously practised. 5. As a general rule, it is far safer and more convenient to extirpate the gi’owth with the ligature; and this, indeed, is the mode of treatment that is most generally applicable to tumours of this kind in whatever situations they may occur, as it effectually removes them without risk of hmmon’hage, and leaves a sore that very readily cicatrises. The ligature requires to be applied in different ways, according to the size and situation of the tumoiu-. In all cases, the best material is firm, round, compressed whip-cord. This should be tied as tightly as possible, and knotted seciu’ely, so that there may be no chance of any part of the tumour escaping complete and immediate strangulation. It is well, if possible, not to include in the noose any healthy skin, but to snip across with a pair of scissors that portion of integument which intervenes between the cords that are tied together; at the same time, care must be taken to pass the ligatures well beyond the limits of the disease. When the tumour is small, an ordinary double h'gature may be passed across its base, by means of a common suture-needle ; and, the noose being cut and the thread tied on each side, strangulation wiU be effected. lATien it is of larger size, and of round shape, the most convenient plan of strangulating the tumour is that recommended by Liston. It consists in passing, by means of long naevus-needles, fixed in wooden handles, and having the eye near their points, double whip-cord ligatures in opposite directions across the tiunoiu’; then cutting through the nooses, and tying together the contiguous ends of the ligatures until the Avhole of the groAvth is encircled and strangled by them. In doing this, a few precautions are necessary: thus, the first lueA us-necdle should be passed across the tumour unarmed (Fig. 834), and used to raise up the gTowth somewhat from the subjacent pai'ts. dhe second needle, aimed as represented in the diagram (Fig. 334), carrying the whipcord ligature by means of a piece of suture-silk, should be passed across the tumour in the opiposite direction to, but underneath, the first needle ; the aimed neepe being Avithdrawn, the ligature is caiTicd across ; and the first one, haAing been937 LIGATURE OF NuEVUS. armed in the same way, cames its noose tlirongh the tumour as it is drawn out. The two nooses having then been cut, an assistant must seize, but not draw upon, six of the ligature ends ; the Surgeon, then, having divided the intervening bridge of skin, ties rather tightly, in a reef-knot, the two enda that are left hanging out; as soon as he has done this, he proceeds to the next two, and so on to the last (Fig. 335). AVhen he ties these, he must do so inth all his force, especially if the tumour be large, as by drawing on them he tightens all the other nooses, and drags the knots towards the centre of the growth, which is thus effectually strangled. He then cuts off the tails of the ligatme. After the tumour has sloughed aivay, which happens in a few days, if it be properly and tightly strangled, the wound is treated on or- dinary principles. If the nmvus be altogether subcutaneous, the skin covering it should not be sacrificed, but, being- divided by a crucial in- Fig. 334.—Diagram of the Application of Na3vus-needles. cision, may be turned down in foiu’ fiaps, and the bgature then tied as directed. In some cases, the nmvus is so flat and elongated that the application of the quadruple ligature, as above described, cannot include the whole of it. In these circumstances, I have found the ligature about to be described eminently useful, having successfully employed it in a great number of instances. Its great advantage is that, while it completely and very readily strangles the tumour, it does not inclose an undue quantity of integument, and thus does not produce a larger cicatrix than is necessary for the eradication‘of the disease. It is applied in the fol- lowing way. A long triangular needle is threaded on the middle of a whip-cord about three yards in length ; one half of this is staiued black with ink, the other half is left uncoloured. The needle is inserted through a fold of the sound skin, about a quai‘ter of an inch from one end of the tumour, and transversely to the axis of the same. It is then earned through, until a double tail, at least six inches in length, is left hanging from the point at which it entered’; it is next carried across the base of the tiunoin, entering and passing out beyond its lateral limits, so as to leave a series of double loops about nine inches in length on each side (Fig. 335). Every one of these loops should be made about three-quarters of an inch apart, including that space of theNjEVUS. 938 tumour; and the last loop should be brought out through a fold of healthy mtcgimmnt beyond the tumour. In this way we have a series of douljle loops, one toMe, and the other hlach, on each side (Fig. 38G). All the while looi)S should now be cut on one side, and the Uaclc loops on the other, leaving hanging ends of thread of corresponding colours. The tumoiu’ may now be strangulated by drawing down and knotting firmly each pair of ivhile threjids on one side, and each pair of Ucwlc ones on the other. In this way the tumour is divided into segments, each of which is strangulated by a noose and a hnot: by blade nooses and ivhite knots on one side, by while nooses and blade knots on the other (Fig. 337). Fig. 333.—Diagram of Ligature of Flat and Elougateil Nie-vus. The cicatrix resulting from the removal of a ntevus is usually firm and healthy ; but, in some instances, I have seen it degenerate into a hard warty mass requiring subsequent excision. The hgatiu’e may be used successfully at all ages. I have repeatedly tied large active ntevi in infants a month or two old without meeting with any accident. N^vi i]sr Special Situations.—Ifaevi of the Scalp are more frequenc than in any otEer situation, excejit, perhaps, the face. When occurring on those parts that are covered by hair, they are almost invariably prominent and subcutaneous : when seated on the forehead, or on the bare skin behmd the eai’s, they are often cutaneous. The ordinary subcutaneous meiTis ‘of the scalp is readily removed by the ajiphcation of the quadruple ligature. Care must be taken in passing the needles not to include the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, or troublesome cellulitis and perhaps suppuration may occim beneath that membrane. In general, it is better not to attempt the preservation of any of the integument covering the growth. It is true that, when removed, a clean white cicatrix is left which ne'^'er covers itself with hair; but this contracts, and in after-life becomes but little visible. The attempt to dissect down the skin that covers the naivus is not only troublesome, but is attended by very considerable, and possibly dangerous, hEemorrhage. Those flat naivi that are situated behind the ear are b^est treated by the free application of fuming nitric acid. Naevus of the Fontanelle is the most important variety of the scalp-939 NJSVUS OF THE FACE. nteyns, and constitutes a somewhat formidable disease. A large pm-ple tumour is situated within the anterior fontanelle, rising and falling with the pulsations of the brain communicated to it, and becoming distended and tense when t e child cries. The tumour is evidently close upon the membranes of the brain, and may be looked upon almost as an intracranial rather than a scalp-tumour. The close proximity of the tumour to the brain and its membranes often deters practitioners from interfering with it; and I not unfxequently see cases^ in which the parents of the child hare been counselled not to allow any operation to be practised, lest death should result. Yet this tumour, so formidable hi appearance, and so deeply seated, close upon the brain, and as it were within the craniimi, may be removed with perfect safety by the ligahm. I have often tied nm^-i in this situation, and have never seen any ill consequences, not even a convulsive fit, occm\ The danger, then, fr’om the mere strangulation of the tumom- in this situation cannot be great; but there is another and a special danger, ^'iz., the risk of wounding the membranes of the brain in passmg the ligatures under the base of the tumour. If nmvus-needles or sharp-pointed instruments of any kind be used, this accident will be very hkely to occur ; and, if this were to happen, inevitably fatal consequences ufill ensue. This accident may always lie avoided by operating in the following way. A pune- ture is made in front of the tumoiu through the healthy scalp. An eyed probe, armed Avith a double ligature, is then pushed through this opening across the base of the tumoiu, and its end is made to project on the opposite side beyond it; here another puncture is made, and the probe and ligature together are drawn through. The same procediue is adopted across the tumour sideways. In this way, a quadruple ligatiue is passed across the tumoiu in two opposite directions : the ends are then disengaged, and the ligature is tightened in the ordinary way. Naevi of the Face are of very common occmrence, and usually cause much disfigurement. The treatment to be adopted necessarily varies greatly, aceord- ing to the natm’e of the mevus, whether cutaneous, subcutaneous, or both ; and especially according to its situation. The same plan, which is advan- tageously adopted in one part, may be altogether inapphcable in another. We shall, accordingly, consider the treatment of these vascular growths, as they affect the eyelids, the nose, the cheeks, and the lips. Nbbvus of the Eyelids is usually cutaneous, consisting of a discoloration or staining, as it were, of the lid, without any material swelling. Such a disease is, I think, better left untouched; it cannot, of course, be removed either by the knife or by eaustics, without producing worse results ; and, as the skin is always deeply involved, milder means are inoperative, or possibly equally destructive. I have heard of sloughing of the eyelid being occasioned by the use of astringent injections ; though, if the inevus were subcutaneous, and constituted a distinct tumour, passing perhaps into the orbit, injection with the perchloride of iron might advantageously be adopted. Nsevus of the Nose may occur in two situations—at the root, or towards the aim and apex. "When seated at the root of the nose, upon the bridge, or at the lower part of the forehead, between and perhaps extending abo\m the eyebrows, it is often subcutaneous, and may attain a very considerable magni- tude. In cases of this kind, I have found the quadruple ligature the readiestNjEVUS. 940 means of rcmo^•al; and although the part included may be of large size, the resultmg^cicatrix is wonderfully small and nan-ow, usually becoming horizontal, so as to fall into the folds of skin naturally existing in that situation. In the case of a little girl about three years of age, brought to me some years ago by berber, I remo^-ed a iirevus that was cutaneous as well as subcutaneous, and as large as a walnut, from this situation, by means of the quadruple ligature, with the most satisfactory result, the resulting cicatrix being remarkably small; and in another little girl, from the bridge of whose nose I removed, some years ago, a najvus as large as a marble, very little scan-ing or deformity resulted. In both these cases, the ncevus was cutaneous as well' as subcuta- neous. If the skin be not affected, injection of perchloride of iron may be advantageously employed in such cases. When the tip and ala3 of the nose' are affected, the ntevus being cutaneous, we can seldom do much to improve the appearance of the patient. In such cases, I have tried breaking down the ntevus, and the galvanic cautery, Awthout any material benefit; the destruc- tion of the tissues soon afterwards leading to deformity. When the ntevus is subcutaneous, occupying the tip, alse, and columna nasi, injection with per- chloride of iron is the only means that I have foimd of real service. In doing this, care must be taken not to throw in too much of the liquid, lest slough- ing or sudden death result. MTaevi of the Cheeks may occur in three distinct forms. 1. There may be a simple cutaneous nsevus, a mere staining of the skin, a “ mother’s mark.” This admits of no treatment; and the subject of it must submit to continue through life to exhibit the characteristic discoloration. 2. The elevated cutaneous na3vus may be raised above the surface, being of a deep purphsh red or plum colom*, and covered with a veiy thin integument. In this form of the disease, I think that the application of concentrated nitric acid is the best moans of extiiq)ation. By one or tAvo fr’ee applications of the caustic, the growth is removed, and a dense white cicatrix, presenting httle disfigm’e- ment, is left in its place. 3. The ntevus may iuA'olve the whole thickness of the cheek, being scarcely, if at ah, cutaneous. Naevi of this kind cannot, of coiu’se, be extirpated, either by the knife, ligatiu’e, or caustics, lest the cheek be perforated, and the most serious disfigimement ensue. In such cases Ave must endeaA'om.’ to obliterate the structure of the naevus by exciting infiamma- tion in it by setons, or by breaking doAvn the structm’e of the gTowth with cataract-needles or a fine tenotome. In a case Avhich I attended some years ago, Avith Bartlett of Notting Hill, a large and deeply seated ntevus, Avhich occupied one cheek, was cimed by haAdng a number of fine silk threads passed across it in different directions, and then being gradually, piece by piece, broken doAvn Avith a cataract-needle; no disfigurement whateA'er being left. WseAri of the Lips require different treatment, according as they occupy the margin or have involved the whole substance of these parts. II'hen seated at the margin, as projecting and someAA'hat pendulous growths, they may A'ery readily be removed by a double or quadruple ligatiu'e, according to their size. This Avas the practice pursued in the case fr’om Avhich the accompanying draAV- ings (Figs. 338, 339) Avere taken, where a most excellent result was obtained by the use of the ligatiu’c, folloAvcd at a later period by injection of perchloride94i N.EVUS OF THE LIPS. of iron into some of the more widely diffused parts of the growth. AYhen the ntevns involves the whole tliickness of the lip, such measures are not always available. If it deeply invade the substance of the lip, an operation somewhat similar to that for the removal of a cancroid gi-owth might l)e practised ; tlic Fig. 338.—Kebtos of Lower : Fig. 339.—NiBVUs of Lower Front View. Lip : Side View. whole substance of the lip being cut through widely on each side, and the edges of the incision brought together with hare-lip pins. Such an operation is only practicable when the disease, though deejply seated, does not si3read to any very great extent laterally. When it does, the whole of one half of the lip, for instance, being involved, the use of the knife, especially in young infants, would be too hazardous, on account of the probability of serious htemorrhage ; and other means must be employed. I have tried the use of setons, and of injections with perchloride of iron ; but not vdth any advantage. When the whole substance of the lip is involved, inclusion and strangulation of the morbid mass by means of the ligatm-e are seldom available ; the amount Fig. 340.—Large Najvus of Upper Lip : Front View.

Of sloughing being very gi-eat, and the child, absorbing the putrescent matters from the sloughing mass which results, incurring the danger of being poisoned from this soiu-ce. In an infant with a very large nmvus, including one half of942 NuEVUS. the lip, ^vhicli I ligatured at the Hospital some years ago, death appeared to result from this cause. One of the most formidable cases of neevus of the lip that T have ever had to do with, and in its results the most satisfactory, was sent to me scTcral years ago, by Budd of Barnstaple. The patient, a little girl five months old, was noticed at birth to have a red streak on the right side of the upper lip ; this rapidly developed into a large tumid purple ncevus, which, Avhen the case came under my observation, Avas about the size of a large Avalnut, involAung the whole of the structures of the lip, from the cutaneous to the mucous surfaces ; it was of a deep mulbeny colour, and extended from the median line of the lip to the angle of the mouth (Figs. 340,341). The integu- ments covering this growth were exceedingly thin, and the tumour itself was in the highest degree vascular and active. Excision appeared to be out of the question ; the hgature presented little to recommend it; injections Avith the perchloride of iron and the introduction of setons were successively tried, but neither of these means produced any effect on the tumour, which commenced to extend upwards into the nostril. I accordingly detennined on using caustics. Mtric acid was first employed ; but, as this did not produce suffi- ciently deep impression on the growth, I had recourse to the potassa cum calce. By means of this, the tumour was gradually removed ; the hEemorrhage Avhich occasionally resulted being restrained by pressure. Hotvdthstanding the amount of tissue destroyed, the resulting cicatrix was small, resembling that of a badly united hare-lip. Three years afterwards, the child was brought to me again, and I was much struck by the wonderful improvement that had taken place since the removal of the nmvus. The lip Avas smooth, the cicatrix in a great degnee worn out, and comparatHely little disfigurement was left in the countenance of an exceedingly pretty and engaging child. Finding, hoAvever, that the lip was still di’aAATi or tucked in by a very dense band of cicatricial tissue, AA'hich caused a deep depression of the ala on that side, I divided this, and the result was most satisfactoiy. ITsevus of the Tongue is of rare occurrence. I have, hoAvever, success- fully operated by means of the ecraseur in one case, in which the Avhole of the free extremity of the organ was involved (Fig. 342).

It had existed for many years Avithout giving any annoyance, but, as it had of late begun to enlarge, and occasionally to bleed, he was desirous of having it Fig. 342.—Nicviis of Tongue.943 NuEVOID LIPOMA. removed. This I did by applying the quadruple ligature, after having dissected the mucous membrane down. Naevi of the Vulva and Pudendum arc by no means unfrequent. Wo have had several instances of the kind in the Hospital of late years. They are usually venous, often attain a large size, and may sometimes involve the integumental structures on the inside of the thigh, or on the perinaeum, as well as the vulva. When the growth is confined to the vulva, it is best removed by the ligature. Some time ago, I removed in this Avay a large pendulous venous ua3A'us, as large as two or three flattened walnuts, from the left labium of a little girl six years of age. In this case, I found it most con- venient to employ the continuous ligature. The same means Avere had recourse to in order to extirpate a large nasvus from the labium of a child three years of age ; but in this case the disease extended to the integaiments of the peri- neeum and inner side of the thigh, and was here remoA’ed by the application of strong nitric acid, after the larger groAvth had separated. On the Extremities, Neck, and Trunk every possible variety of nmAUis occurs. IWien the disease is flat, consisting rather of staining of the skin than of any actual tumour, it may commonly be treated successfully by the applica- tion of the strong tincture of iodine ; or should it be thought desirable to- remove it, this may be effected by rubbing it Avith strong nitric acid. If the n£BA-us assume the form of a tumour, it wiU almost invariably be of a venous character, and then removal by means of the ligature should be effected. If the groAvth be round, the ordinary quadruple ligature may be employed: if flat or elongated, the longitudinal continuous Ligature is preferable. NiEVOiD LirOMA.—This is a form of nsevns Avith which I have occasionally met, but AAhich does not appear to have attracted much notice, although Hdlaton speaks of it, and Bilh'oth says that in lipoma he has several times seen cavernous dilatation of the veins. It is a tumour in which the n^evoid structure- is conjoined Avith or deposited in a cellulo-fatty mass. This disease is invariably seated upon the nates, back, or thigh. It occurs as a smooth, doughy, indolent tumour, incompressible, not varying in size or shape, Avithout heat, thiill, or pulsation of any kind, possibly having a few veins ramifying over its siufface, biit^ no distinot vaseular appearanee. It is usually congenital, or has been noticed in early childhood ; and it continues Avithout any very material change in shape, size, or appearance, until the inconvenience or deformity occasioned by it requires its removal. This is best effected by the knife. After removal, the tumour Avill be found to be composed of a cellulo-adipose basis, having'' a large number of veins ramifying through it, so as to constitute a distinct vascular element, communicating -with small cysts containing a bloody fluid. The tumour has occasionally a tendency to recur after remoA'al. In one case- I have operated three times for the removal of a large gi'OAvth of this descrip- ^on, situated on the buttock, and extending forward toAvards the perimeiun Ihe first operation was performed in 1851; the second in 1850 ; and the patient’ then eighteen years of age, again presented himself in 1863 with a recuiTenco of the growth in an ulcerated state, in the cicatrix of the former operations Ihe situation in Avhich I have seen such tiunours occur, where they o-ave rise to most inconvenience, and Avhere their removal has required the greatest care944 HEMORRHAGIC DIATHESIS. lias been tlie anterior part of the thigh, just below Poupart’s ligament, close upon and almost in connection Avith the femoral vessels. In a case of this description, which was sent to me by Edwards of Antigua, the patient, a gentle- man of that island, had suffered for some years from a chronic solid oedema ■o one of his legs, apparently dependent upon the pressure exercised upon the saphena and femoral A'eins by an elongated indolent tumour just below Pou- part s hpment, and over the course of these vessels. This tumour had existed li-om childhood, and presented the signs that have just been given as charac- teristic of the disease under consideration. It was removed hy an incision parallel to Poupart’s ligament, some careful dissection being required to sepa- rate it from the femoral sheath, more particularly towards the inner side, Avhere n prolongation of the tumour dipped down by the side of the femoral vein, compressing that vessel, and so disposing to the occurrence of the oedema of the hmb. After removal, the tumom- was found to consist of a mass of condensed cellulo-adipose tissue, with much vascular structm’c intermixed, •and some small cysts. The cedema gradually subsided ; and when the patient left England, about three months after the operation, the hmb had nearly regained its normal size, being but little larger than the sound one. H.ffi:MOKRHAGIC DIATHESIS. In connection with diseases of the arteries, it may be stated that in some constitutions it is found, though fortunately very rai-ely, that there is a great tendency to very troublesome, indeed almost uncontrollable bleeding, fr-om trivial woimds ; life being put in jeopardy, or even lost, by the hasmondiage resulting fr-om the extraction of a tooth, the opening of an abscess, lancing the gums, or some equally shght unimportant surgical procedure. The blood does not flow in a jet, but continues to trickle in an oozing stream, apparently from the capillaries rather than fr-om the arteries of the part. In these cases also there is a great tendency to inordinate ecchymosis fr-om very slight contusion, the areolar tissue becoming rapidly fiUed with fluid uncoagulable blood. It is important to observe that by the “Htemon-hagic Diathesis” is expressed a constitutional condition, that is unconnected with, and independent of, •any physiological irritabihty or pathological change in the larger arterial trunks. Causes.—The HcemorrJiagic Diathesis appears to be connected with or dependent upon one of thi-ee distinct conditions. 1. It may be congenital, and not mifrequently is hereditai-y, especially in the male line. In some families the males only have been affected, and the diathesis has been transmitted in the second or third generation through females ; who, themselves being unaffected by it, hai’e had male children who Avere the subjects of the disease. A very remarkable genealogical account of ■such a family has been drawn up by C. Heath. This diathesis occiu-s in jiersons othei-Avdse robust and strong, without any appai-ent derangement of health, or morbid condition, innate or acquired, to account for it. In such ■cases the family peculiarity is usually recognised, and Avell knoAvn to those liable to it.945 CAUSES OF lEEMOPlITLIA. In these families of bleeders, it is scarcely necessary to say that it is imperative to be careful to make no surgical wounds, even of the most trivial character, if they can possibly bo avoided. Above all, the extraction of teeth must be avoided. It is after this slight operation that the most uncontrollable and fixtal hiemorrhages have occmTcd. The htnmorrhagcs, though usually trau- matic, may be spontaneous ; they then usually jirocced froin the nose, bowel, kidney, or subcutaneous connective tissue. In women they assume the character of profuse and uncontrollable menorrhagia. The haemorrhages are accompa- nied by the symptoms described at page 2G(;, as characterising excessive loss of blood; and after their cessation the patient usually remains anaemic for many weeks or months. The quantity of blood lost is often enormous, amounting in some cases to several pounds in the twenty-four hours. Formerly it was supposed that females were exempt from haemophilia. But Dr. Wickham Legg, to whom we are indebted for an excellent monogTaph on this condition, states that this assumption can no longer be maintained, although women are far less disposed to the disease than men ; that they present few instances of the more typical forms of the disease ; and that it is less fatal iu them than in men. j\Iost of the fatal cases in women have occuiTed by htemorrhage from the genital organs, and Legg quotes a case from Wachsmuth, “ where the rupture of the hymen on the marriage-night caused the death of the bride from h£emorrhas:e.” A frequent symptom accompanying this diathesis is a painful and sudden swelling of one or more joints either occurring spontaneously, or as the result of some slight injury. The swelling is the result of an effusion into the synovial membrane, of blood and synovia. It may last only a few days or may endm'e for months. The joint is often permanently weakened, and relapses are fr’equent during the cure. 2. HcBmophilia may occiu* iu individuals from some fault in the solid con- stituents of the body, in consequence of which the smaUer vessels ruptiu-e too easily, and when divided do not contract with sufficient readiness. There appears to be every degree in the tendency to bleed abnormally, from persons who, being “out of condition,” and having the tissues soft and flaccid, bleed freely and bruise extensively from trivial wounds and slight blows, to those vho are affected with true hereditary Inemophilia. The bleedino- in these cases IS maintained by the laxity of flbre preventing the proper contrac- tion of the divided or torn vessels; and the tendency to hiemorrhao-e wiU vary at different times in the same person according as the state of hisliealth improves or deteriorates. teiideney to hamiorrhage may depend upon a morbid state cLT In^ coagulability is diminished or _ ei lost, ihis state IS often met with in diseases such as scurvy chronic jaundice, and albuminuria, that produce a diffluent state of the blood The e^dition of the blood in true luemophilia has attracted the attentionf mail ► o^eons and Pathologists.

At tlic moro advanced periods, Avlien tlie patient has become j anmmic, the coagulum becomes Avcakcr, and at last ceases to form altogether, the '■ blood being -watery and only tinged -\vith colouring matter. ° ’ * It would appear then that the only facts of importance that we at iwesent possess to throw light on the cause of hc^mophilia are, that it is hereditary ; that it is far more frequent in males than in females ; and that it may occur at all ages and in all countries. The relative parts played by the solid constituents of the body, the blood- vessels, and the blood, are absolutely unknown, as is its exact pathology. From the influence exerted by local apjjlications, there is, however, reason to believe as will be immediately stated, that the solids rather than the blood are at fault, and that one element in the disease is certainly a want of proper pontractility of the arteries. Tkeatmext.—In the constitutional treatment of a hsemorrhagic tendency dependent on those conditions that alter the constitution of the blood, such as scurvy, chronic jaundice, &c., much may be done by appropriate medical means. But in the true hereditary ha3mophilia, no remedies appear to exercise the slightest influence over the diathesis. At the same time, it would be wise that the subject of this unfortunate condition should attend to those ordinary ^ rules of health, the neglect of which, by lowering “ his condition,” might favour the tendency to bleed. Legg especially recommends the use of cold baths of plain, sea, or chalybeate waters, residence in a dry air, and the use of warm clothing. The preparations of iron are usually given in a routine way, but it I is doubtful if they have ever been of service in preventing the htemonhages, ’ certainly never in airesting them, though they may be of use in remo-ving the , anmmic state left after a copious bleeding. The Local Treatment is that on Avhich most dependence will necessarily be i placed. It consists in the use of three means—viz.. Pressure, Styptics, and j Cold. Pressure is only to be relied on in one form of ha;mophilic bleeding—viz., the continuous haemorrhage from the socket of a tooth after extraction. In these cases the cavity should be cleared out and carefully plugged from the bottom by means of lint or agaric, the whole retained by means of a piece of cork and a gutta-percha cap to fit over the neighbouring teeth, and comiwessed by a bandage applied under the chin against those in the soimd jaw. When | the hemorrhage occurs fr’om the soft parts, pressme must be used mth gveat j caution lest sloughing occur ; the integmnents being extremely liable to give way extensively under very moderate pressure, large subcutaneous extravasation developing at the same time, thus increasing materially the danger of the case and the local mischief. The compression of the main artery of the limb is useless and liable to the j objection of the development of ecchymoses and subcutaneous hjemorrhages. / Styptics of all kinds ha’^'e been used as a matter of course, and the per- j (diloride of iron has enjoyed especial favour. I haA e used and seen it used J frequently in a family of bleeders, members of Avhich have for many years c past been in the habit of coming to the University College Hospital for the | arrest of haimoiTbagcs. I can safely say that I haA’e ncA’er scon an} permanent e I Ijenefit from its appheation, or that of any other styptic, in these cases. j947 TREATMENT OF HjEMOPIIILIA. Tncleecl, great evil lias often resulted from the inflammation excited by the applieation of styptics of any kind. The parts become swollen, fall into slough, and as they separate the area of the raw and oozing surface extends, and the same process has to be gone through over again. The actual Cautery presents tlie same inconveniences as ordinary styptics. Tt may arrest temporarily the bleeding, but inflammation is sot up in the parts beyond the limit of the eschar, and this on separating leaves an extended ulcerating surfoce which bleeds again, and perhaps more freely than before. The continued application of Cold appears to arrest luemophilic bleeding more eftectually than any other means, and this circumstance would lead to the belief that the hremorrhage is due to want of contractility in the smaller arteries rather than to want of coagulability in the blood. The cold may be applied by means of irrigation of iced water, as has been done successfully by jMar-shall, or by the ajrplication of ice either directly to the part or laid upon a sponge covering it, as has been done by Beck in some of the hmmophilic cases occrrrring at Uni^-ersity College Hospital. Simple water may be used, or a weak antiseptic solution of boracic acid. If the bleedirrg wourrd be irr the extremities, the limb should be kept absolutely at rest on a splmt. The Surgeon has already been cautioned as to the inexpediency of per- forming any operation, except under circumstances of the most urgerrt neces- sity, on any member of a family of bleeders, or on an individual known to be the subject of htemophilia. Should an operative procedure become rrecessary, it shorrld, if possible, be rrudertakerr with the galvanic knife, if it be desired to make a simple incision ; by the galvanic ecraseur, if it be expedient to remove a part or to perform a small amputation. In the event of the galvanic ecraseur not being at hand, the clctsUc ligature would be the best substitute. 3 T 2EEEATA.

De Chaumout has analyzed the air of two of the London hospitals. Besides gaseous impurities in the form of free and albuminoid ammonia, organic oxygen, carbonic acid, nitric and nitrous acids, a quantity of solid matters suspended in the inspired air, on microscopical examination (5G2 d), these suspended particles were found to consist of a quantity of skin epider- mis, of nucleated epithelium from the mouth, pus-cells, and minute bodies (Sphicrobacteria), in active motion, besides a quantity of fibres of clothing. The dust from the ward showed, under a power of 300 diameters, fibres of clothing, dyed and midyed, wood and vegetable tissue, soot and charred wood, epithehmn, starch, a great deal of granular matter and spores of some kind; in fact, it was almost wholly organic. On the walls of one of the hospitals of Paris, Broca found pus-cells; and Nepveu discovered, in a similar locahty, at another, micrococci in immense numbers, microbacteria, epithelium, pus-ceUs, and red corpuscles. These facts, which might be greatly extended, prove that hospital air is, under ordinary circumstances, loaded with, and the Avails covered by, organic matters, often in a state of activity. These are germs of those diseases Avhich are the scourges of hospitals—the prevalence of Avhich is alike the evidence and the measure of their insalubrity, Avhich ai'e preventable by improA cd hygienic arrangements, and which, doubtless, Avill be prevented when once it is recognised that they arc not necessary and unavoidable cauIs. Page 9. 2.—VENTILATION IN HOSPITALS. Ihe effective height of a Avard to reckon for purposes of ventilation does not exceed 1:2 ft. Each surgical bed should have at least from 120 to 150 square feet of floor-space ; and the air of a surgical ward should be chanf^ed about three times in the hour, giving each patient about 5000 cubic feet° of air per hour.AD DENJJ A TO VOLUME /. 952 Pagk 10. 3. —HO SPITALISM. The foultj hygienic conditions that arc still too frequently met with in hospitals arc alike a cruelty to the patient and an injustice to the Surgeon. I he cruelty to the patient consists not only in exposing him to an increased ^ance of death—or as it is commonly termed “ to a higher rate of mortality” from septic diseases that are preventable, and that are the direct outcome of the defective hygiemc arrangements of the institution—but in subjecting him to a prolonged and imperfect convalescence, either or both of which conditions may be taken as the measure of the neglect of sanitary aiTangements in a hospital. Bub want of attention to sanitary hospital arrangement is equally an injus- tice to the Surgeon. His reputation suffers by an increased rate of mortality amongst his patients from causes which, though preventable, are altogether beyond the sphere of his control; an undue burden of anxiety, responsibihty, and of care is throvm upon him by the necessity under which he lies of waging a constant Avarfare against septic hospital influences. If it were not for erysipelas, pytumia, septica3mia, and “ blood-poisoning ” in its protean forms, the duties of a hospital Siu’geon would be comparatively light. In order to combat these pernicious influences, he is driAnn to the emjiloyment of elaborate, compheated, and expensive methods of “ Antiseptic ” treatment Avith the view of destroying those septic germs which, conveyed by the air and implanted on the wound, act as poison to its tissues and ferments to its fluids. He is compelled to accomplish by artificial means those results Avhich the architects and managers of hospitals ought to secure by proper attention to the construction of the building, its A'entilation, and general management. If hospital hygiene Avere properly understood and efficiently practised, those foul and filth-begotten diseases, jAytemia and hospital gangvene, wonld disap- pear, and “ antiseptics,” in the absence of septic influences, Avould become uimecessary. Under the present system we begin at the Avroug end. Instead of preventing the development of septic contaminations by proper hygienic aiTangements, we alloAV the pollution to take place, and then attempt to prevent infection of the wound by ingeniously devised methods of protection, and by destroying the impimties in the septic-laden atmosphere by means of chemical agents. In fact, cleanliness in its broadest sense is the best and most efficient “antiseptic” ; where it exists none other is needed. It is superior to all chemical antiseptics in this, that it prevents the development of the septic poisons, instead of alloAving them to be generated and then destroying them.ADDENDA TO VOLUME I. 953. Page 10. 4.—HOSPITAL HYGIENE. Attention to hospital hygiene is by no means of so modem a date as many miglit be led to suppose. The Surgeons of the last century paid great atten tion to it, and their suceess Avas proportionately great. Thus Alanson’s- success in amputations has never been surpassed, and rarely, if ever, equalled eA’en by the aid of antiseptics and of every modern chemical and mechanical appliance. Writing in 1782 (“ Alanson on ximj)utation and the After-treat- ment,” London, 1782), ho says (Preface, p. 15), that he amputated in thirty- Ha'c cases, such as promiscuously occurred in the LiA'erpool Infirmary, iviihonl the loss of a sinijk])atient. The symptomatic fever Avas slight, and there Avas- not an instance of secondary haemorrhage in the Avhole series. Can these results be equalled iioaa' ? I doubt it much. But Alanson Avas a sanitary reformer in his day; and had his instructions been folloAA^ed, thousands of lives. Avould have been saved Avhich have since his time been Avantonly sacrificed by the neglect of hygienic measm-es. His advice is so practical that it desen'es the attentive study of the modern Siu’geon. He says: “ The air in AA'hich the case is to be conducted is a point Avorthy of your greatest attention : if possible, the room should be spacious, and in an open vrholesome situation. It is AA^ell knoAvn that in hospitals Avhich are situated iu populous toAATis and are much croAvded, the salutary influence of the air is so altered, that compound fractm-es and other important surgical cases prove peculiarly fatal, and that such fractures may alrnost certainly be cured in the country.” . . . “ The operation of amputation done in the country, as aboA’e described, AA'ill be foUoAved almost certainly Avith a speedy cure ; there the consequent symptoms are trifling, nearly the AAhole internal surface of the Avound unites by the first intention, the suppuration consequently is small.” , . . “ Jlany hospitals are so tainted by uiiAA'holesome efflima that they arc rather a pest than a rehef to the objects they contain.” (Op. cit., p. 89—92). Then foUoAV sixteen distinct paragraphs or heads of the most useful sanitary advice, Avhich “ are humbly recommended to those Avho haA’e the care of hospitals in Avant of such attention.” This code of regulations deserves careful study. In it Alanson adA'ises : That no Avard should be inhabited for more than four months at a time ; that it bo cleansed, AvhiteAvashed, and purified. That the “ bed-stocks ” be of iron ; the bedding frequently changed, and made of inexpensiA'e materials so that it may easily be reneAA^ed ; and that Avhen the AA'eather admits, it be ex-posed to the open air for several hours a day. That dirty patients bo stripped of their clothing before admission ; that they have a Avarm bath and then be clothed in dresses provided by the hospital. That the infected clothes be baked in a properly constructed oven. That iieAAdy admitted patients be put into clean, Avell-ventilated Avards. That all incurable and infectious cases, and especially chronically ulcerated logs, be refused admission. That offensive pngrenous and putrid sores be placed iu distinct rooms, and not suffered to infect a Avhole Avard. That thcro should be particular rooms proA ided for954 ADDENDA TO VOLUME /. patients who have undergone operations ; that they should be airy, never long inhabited, and afterwards cleansed and ventilated. That a hospital should never be crowded on any account, and always so large that a part may be uninhabited, ihat the windows be opened for a certain number of hours daily. And lastly, that oA’ery hospital should have a “house in the country,” in other words, a “ convalescent home,” attached to it. Modern science has enabled to determine by the microscope and the test-tube the true nature of those conditions that lead to hospital infection, but sanitary practice has not as yet gone in advance of the admirable precepts laid down by xYlanson a century ago.

Page 80. 6.—HEY’S AMPUTATION. By “ Key’s Amputation ” is usually meant the disarticulation of the meta- tarsus from the tarsus, and the formation of a flap from the anterior part of the sole of the foot. But Hey describes three different amjmtations, only one of which coiTesponds to this method. In his “ Practical Observations, London, 1814, p. 550, he says, “I have judged it to be the safer method to take ^ away all the diseased integuments by a transverse and a longitudinal incision made at right angles to each other, and then to saw off the metatarsal liones as far as the morbid integuments extended.” _ At p. 553 he says, that in operating on a girl about 18, a method suggested itself to him of finishing the operation, which proved highly advantageous to the patient. Ha^’ing dissected out the metatarsal bones and removed the toes by a transverse incision made at their junction with the metatarsal bones, I elevated the integuments and muscles forming the sole of the foot, &c.” This operation was done in the year 1797. In the year 1799, p. 554, he states that he operated as follows. “ I removed all the toes at their junction, with the metatarsal bones, and then separated the integuments and muscles, forming the sole of the foot, from the inferior part of the metatarsal bones, keeping the edge of my scalpel as near the bones as 1 could .... I then separated with the scalpel the four smaller metatarsal bones at their .lunction with the tarsus, which was easily effected, as the joints he m a straight line across the foot. The projecting part of the first cunei- oim bone which supports the great toe, I was obliged to divide with a saw.”ADDENDA TO VOLUME I. 955 lluis it would appear tliat in tlic first case Mey mwf;d across tlio metatarsal bones after ha\ing made the flap. In the second case, he disseclccl out all the metatarsal bones, and then made a flap from the sole. In the third case, he first made the sole-flap, and then, having ilissecleit out the four smaller metatarsal bones, scuoed across the internal cuneiform; thus comlrining the two methods of cutting and sawing. Page HU). 7.—ANTISEPTIC TREATMENT. That the “Antiseptic Treatment” has been of much service in the pre- '\-ention of the infection of wounds, more especially in old, crowded, and pestilential hospitals, there can be little doubt. lYe have, however, un- fortunately as yet no definite data by which to judge of the comparative merits of this and other modern methods of treating wounds. The general recognition by Surgeons of the necessity of the free drainage of woimds, with or without the employment of antiseptics, has undoubtedly tended, more than any one single improvement in practice, to lessen those evils which necessarily result from the decomposition of pent-up fluids in contact with raw surfaces. So also the general employment of disinfectants of aU kinds, and the great attention that is now bestowed on hospital hygiene in the recognition of the importance of abundant air-supply and free ventilation, of the evils of over- crowding, of the necessity of care in the distribution of patients, and in the avoidance of aU carriers of infection, such as sponges, instruments, clothes, &c., have greatly tended to improve the sanitary condition of most hospitals—and to lessen the liability to the generation and diflusion of septic disease. The introduction of the “ antiseptic treatment ” being cotemporaneous, with the general adoption of improved hospital hygiene, the patients subjected to this method necessarily participate in the advantages that flow from exposme to sanitary conditions that have been so much altered for the better. Hence it is not reasonable or just to ascribe a diminution of the amoimt of septic disease in a hospital in which the “Antiseptic Method” is employed, to that alone, and to the exclusion of all other causes. Either hygiene is of no value in surgical cases, or some and probably no inconsiderable share in the improved results must in justice be assigned to the generally ameliorated sanitary con- ditions. The oMy comparison that can justly or scientifically be instituted, is between one set of patients treated antiseptically with another of a similar kind subjected cotemporaneously to other methods of treatment. And for this comparison to have any practical value, it must be continued for a sufficiently lengthened period to eliminate all sources of error from accidental causes. It is manifestly unscientific to compare the results of modern with those of older methods of surgical practice, even in the same institutions, where the attendant conditions, independent of mere treatment, are dissimilar; and it is equally incorrect and unjust to refer all improvements in results to one onl} of the many improved conditions to which the patient is now subjected.ADDENDA TO VOLUME I. 957 PAriK 271. 8.—TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD. A very ingenious apparatus for the perforaiance of direct transfusion has lately been fntroduced into this country by Dr. Roussel, of Genera, n'ho in- vented it as long ago as 1804. It is so designed as to render the entrance of nir during the operation almost impossible, and is made of natural black caoutchouc, in contact with which the blood is said to coagulate much more ■slowly than Avith any other material. The instrument consists of a rigid cylinder of A'ulcanite, Avhich is surrounded by a cup of the same material. When applied to the arm, the edges of the cup and the loAver end of the cylinder press upon the skin, and the instrument is fixed in position by ex- hausting the air contained in the space betAveen the cup, the cylinder and the skin by means of a powerful india-rubber ball, which is connected with the «pace by a tube. It must be so applied that the vein AAfill be seen on looking- down the cylinder exactly in the centre of the space enclosed by its loAver end. The cylinder has tAvo tubes opening into it, one fitted with a stop-cock, leading to a basin containing warm water, and the other fitted with a Higginson’s syringe capable of containing 10 grammes of fiuid. Beyond the syringe the tube dmdes into tAvo parts, one of which is fitted with a Auilcanite nozzle to be introduced into the vein of the recipient. A stop-cock is fitted at the junction of these tubes, so that the stream from the syringe may be directed into either at AviU. The upper end of the cylinder is closed during the performance of ;the operation by an accurately fitting plug of vulcanite, through the middle of ■ which passes a small lancet, which can be driven doAvn into the vein by pressing a button at the top of the plug, and is then retracted again by a spring. The depth to which the lancet can be depressed is accurately regulated by a small .screw, and it is so an-anged that no air can enter beside it. Everything being- ready, the cup and cylinder firmly fixed, and the vein (at a point which is not •over the artery) exactly in the centre of the loAver opening of the cylinder, the plug is inserted into the upper opening. By a few actions of the syringe a vpiantity of water is draAAm in by the aflFerent tube, which expels the air from .the cylinder, and fills it and the efferent tube^ with water AA^hen the stop-cock leading to the afferent tube is closed. The nozzle is then inserted into the A'ein of the recipient, and the stop-cock turned so as to direct the floAv to the other efferent tube. The lancet is now driven sharply doAvn into the vein, and is immediately retracted by the small spring, and the Aoin is thus opened under Avatcr. On working the syringe the blood is aspirated from the open vein, Sind flows into the efferent tube, Avhich is open. As soon as pure blood begins to lloAv, the stop-cock is turned so as to open the tube connected Avith the cannula in the Aoin of the recipient, and close the other. The small quantity of Avatei- contained in this tube and the cannula is then driven on into the vein, and afterwards pure blood can be pumped in as lono- as is necessary.9SS ADDENDA TO VOLUME I. Page 31)1. 9.- PEKOUSSION IN THE TREATMENT OP UNUNITED PRACTURES. Percussion of the ends of the bones has been successfully employed in these cases by I\Ir. H. (). Thomas, The method consists in protcctino- the skin at the seat of fracture with a piece of felt, and then percussing forcibly the ends of the broken but ununited bone by means of a copper mallet. The percussion under anmsthesia may be continued for several—as many as ten—minutes ; it may only be required once, or may need several repetitions. The effect is a good deal of local sn elling and irritation. The limb should be put up firmly as for recent fracture, and a cure may be expected in fr'om foiu’ to sLx weeks. Page 4G1. 10.—MANIPULATIONS IN DISLOCATIONS. Reduction of Dislocatiom of Hf ly Manipulation is first described by Thomas: Anderson, Surgeon, of Leith, in the third volume of “The Medical and Philosophical Commentaries” for 1775. He describes two cases, one of dislocation on the foramen ovale in a man—the other a dislocation on the dorsum ilii in a boy. In the first case the pullies had been used ineffectually several times, when the “ lacque ” slipping, their use was discontinued. Mr. Anderson says ; “ I Avas convinced that attempting the reduction in the common method, with the- thigh extended, Avas improper, as the muscles Avere put upon the stretch, the action of which is perhaps sufficient to overcome any extension we can employ. But by bringing the thigh to near a right angle with the tnmk, by which the muscles would be gxeatly relaxed, I imagined the reduction might more readily take place, and Avith much less extension. “ I o-aised the thigh to alout a right angle ivith the trunh, and, Avith my right hand at the ham, laid hold of the thigh, and made what extension I could. At the same time that I did this, with my left hand at the head and inside of the thigh, I pressed it toAvards the acetabulum, while my right gaA’e the femur a little circular turn, so as to bring the rotula inwards to its natin-al situation, and at the second attempt it Avent in with a snap.” In the second case, the reduction Avas not attempted till the eighteenth day after the accident. The patient was laid across the bed, and the thigh raimt so as to form cm acute angle with the trunk. In this situation, the knee of the dislocated limb lay considerably over the sound thigh. “ Considerable ex- tension Avas then made ; Avith my left hand I laid hold of the middle of the leg which I brought iiiAvards. By this the femur made a circular turn, Avhich directed its head toAvards the acetabulum, into Avhich it Avent Avith a sensible noise” (pp. 4:^0—428).ADDENDA TO VOLUAIE I. 959 J’a^e 538. 11.—COUNTER-FISSURE OP THE SKULL. For the mechanism of the production of tlie accident, I ivonld refer the- reader to Haller’s DDjwtaliovpx Ghinirgica'; and to the prize memoirs of the- Iloyal Academy of Surgery of Franee, by (^uesnay and others. Sir Charles Bell has some excellent and philosophical observations on this subject in his “Surgical Observations,” London, 181G, p. 472, et seq. He concludes by these remarks : “ As to counter-fissure he (the Surgeon), under- standing the principle, ivill comprehend ho^v a remote and weaker part of the cranium is rent when a thicker and more convex part is struck. He will not bo siu'prised that when the stronger occipital bone is struck the temples will be spaiTed out, or how, these resisting, the base may be fractimed. . . . and he sees that, although the refiected force be not so great as to burst the bones asunder, yet it injures the fine texture of the brain ; in one instance it throws out blood upon its surface ; in another it separates the dura mater ; or, in a third, it covers the brain ivith purulent matter, and that at the part dia- metrically opposite to the injury of the skull.” Page 54!). 12.—KEY'S SAV/. The instrument familiarly known as Hey’s Saw does not appear to have- been invented, though it ivas largely used and described, by Mr. William Hey,, of Leeds. He states (“ Practical Observations on Sm-gery,” London, 1814, p. 9),. that the instrument was first shown him by Dr. Oockell, of Pontefract, and that a saw, formed on the same principle, is represented in Scultetus’ Armamen- tarium Chirurgicum. In the works of Ambrose Pare (edited by Malgaigne,. Vol. II., p. 14), will be found an exact representation of the instrument, with a straight edge, as depicted by Hey, and as used at the present day. He says : “ Par icelle on peut couper de I’os (sans comprimer dessus) tant ou si pen qu’on voudra, sans estre en danger de comprimer I’os fracture sur les membranes, et par consequent sur le cerueau.” Page 559. 13.—MECHANISM OP MENINGEAL EXTRAVASATIONS. Sir Charles Bell (“Surgical Observations,” London, 181G), has iiivestigatecl and determined the method of the production of intracranial meningeal ex- travasations. He says : “ It is extraordinary that any one who has ever raised the skull-cap in dissection, and felt the strength of the universaly6o ABLE NT) A TO VOLUME J. adliesions of the dura mater to the louver surface of tlie hone, could for an instant beheve that the arhria mmim/Pa nmlia has power of throwing- out its blood to the effect of tearing up these adhesions from the entire half of the cranium ! _ He then describes the following experiment to show that the dura mater is first of all separated from the skull, and that the extraA-asation is consequent on that separation : - Strike the skull of the subject with a heavy mallet ; on dissecting, you find the dura mater to be shaken from the skull at the part struck. ^ Repeat the experiment on another subject, and inject the Jiead minutely with size-injection, and you will find a clut of the injection lyim-- betwixt the skull and dura mater at the part struck, and having an exact resemblance to the coagulum found after violent blows on the head. I imao-inc this is conclusive ” (qtp. 4G6—G7). “ Page 8^32. 14.—INFECTION OF SYPHILIS. In speaking of the mode of propagation of syphilis, lYiseman says : “ It is frequent to mention other secondary ways of the propagation of it; as lying in the same bed with an infected person, lying in the same sheets after them^ or wearing their cloaths Drinking ivith one so affected, or sitting on the close-stool after them, are likewise mentioned among the causes of infection. These are all such convenient excuses for the more shie and coy patients, that it is a pity to discoimtenance them ” (IViscman : “ Several Ghirurgical Treatises. Of Lues Venerea,” London, 1G7G). Page 035. 15.—GALVANO-PUNCTUBE : THE ELECTBIC AND THEBMIC CAUTEEY IN N.EVUS. Superficial nmA'i may readily be destroyed by means of the Galvanic Cautery, or by Paquelin’s Thermic Cautery. But this method of treatment is not ■applicable to n-aevi situated in deep cavities, or amongst important structures. In such cases the galvano-punctm-e may be employed vltli the view of decomposing by electrolytic action the contained blood, and thus causing the obliteration ofthe nmvus by coagulation. The details of this method are identical with those of galvano-pimcture in the treatment of aneurism, and Anil be found fully described in Vol. II., p. GI.3 Q INDEX TO VOLUME I.

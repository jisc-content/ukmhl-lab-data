FLAP AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. 89 interosseous soft parts divided by canying tlie instrument in a ^ Ijctween the bones. In doing this, especial care must be taken not to dnect the edo-e upwards, so as to split either of the tibial arteries, more particularly the aiftcrior • for, as this vessel retracts above the membrane, its ligature, when divided too high, is no easy matter. If the amputation be peiioimed iust below the knee, it is possible that the popliteal trunk may be divided before its bifurcation, and thus one artery only recpiire the ligature. In sawing the bones, the fibula should always be cut first, as otherwise it will be neai^ sme to be splintered. This bone may be best divided on the left side, by sink- ing the hand below the level of the limb, and using the heel of the saw ; and on the rio-ht by holding the hand above the limb, and cutting Avitli the end of the instriment (Fig. 56). After the removal of the limb, the shai-p anterior Fig. 56.—Ami.ut;\tion of tlie Leg. Sawing the Bonos. edge of the tibia may advantageously be sliced oft obliquely, so as to lessen the risk of sloughing of the corresponding flap from pressme upon a sharp ridge of bone. If the limb be vciy muscular, a large pad of the muscles of the calf wiU be left in the posterior flap ; this Avill usually be a good deal in the ivay during treatment; it may slough, and thus interfere Avith proper nnioii. In some cases, I have advantageously removed at one SAveep the greater part of the muscular mass thus left, leaving little more than a skin-flap. In order to avoid redmidaiice of muscle, the best operation consists in forming skin- flaps on the anterior and posterior aspects of the limb, and then making a circular cut through the muscles. This may be done in various Avays accord- ing to the seat of the amputation and the amount of skin available for the formation of flaps.

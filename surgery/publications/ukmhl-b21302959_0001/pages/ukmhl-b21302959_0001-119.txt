In doing this, care must be taken not Fig. 58.—Amputation of tlie Leg by Long Anterior and Short Posterior Shin flaps, witli Circular Division of the Muscles. again to wound the anterior tibial artery. Finally, the bones are cleaned and sawn as high as possible. The sharji point of the tibia must be rounded off. In doing this it is well carefully to raise the periosteum with a knife or perios- teal elevator before applying the saw or bone-forceps, as by so doing the tendency to necrosis is somewhat diminished, the periosteum not being torn away to a higher point than that at Avhich the bone is actually sawn. If from any cause there shoidd not be sufficient skin available to form the long anterior flap, the circular operation or the modification of it recom- mended by Liston, as described on p. 40, may be employed instead (see Fig. 0, p. 40). All these operations have the great advantage of getting rid of the hea>7 mass of the muscles of the calf, and that by the long anterior flap secures in addition that the cicatrix shall be well behind the cut ends of the bones, and that there shall be a dependent opening for the exit of the discharges. The long anterior flap tends to keep itself in position by its o^vn weight, and no strapping is required as in the amputation by the long posterior flap, and so a great source of pain to the patient and disturbance to the sUimp

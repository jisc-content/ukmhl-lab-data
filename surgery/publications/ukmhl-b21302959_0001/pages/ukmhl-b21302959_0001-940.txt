Beef-tea and wine should, therefore, he administered by the mouth, as long as the patient can swallow, and nutritious enemata by the rectum ; and in this Avay the powers of life may be supported until the Tiolenco of the disease expends itself, I am, however, disposed to think that even in these chronic cases much more may be done by simple than by specific treatment. Clearing out the bowels by a turpentine enema, breaking the violence of the spasms and giving the patient rest and ease by chloroform inhalations or by chloral enemata, and keeping up the powers of the system by injections of beef-tea, egg, and brandy into the rectum, till the disease wears itself out, appear most likely to be followed by a satisfactory result, when used in addition to the hygienic measures recommended in the acute form of the disease. It is certainly more rational to employ such measures as these, than to be constantly recm-ring to antispasmodics and sedatives, which repeated experience has proved to be useless as curative agents, in the vain hoping of finding a specific for tetanus.

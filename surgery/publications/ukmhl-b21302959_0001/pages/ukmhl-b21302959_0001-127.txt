It may be performed equally well at any part of the thigh Irom the trochanters to the lower end, where the skin of the patella is included in the anterior flap. Amputation through the Trochanters may sometimes be advantageously practised, either in severe compound fractm-es of the lower part of the thigh, or in cases of maligmant, cartilaginous or osseous tumoim of the lower and middle thirds of the femiu'; and thus the more severe and dangerous operation of disarticulation at the hip may be avoided. Indeed should it bo found, after section of the bone, that it is so much injimed or diseased as to require removal at the joint, this may readily enough be c one y dissecting the head out of the acetabulum with a strong scalpel or J * u-bof‘'imputation of the thigh is very considerable frac n-o oftr'? for compound < ue of the femur itselt.

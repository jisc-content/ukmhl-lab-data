SPECIAL AAIPUTA TIDES. 76 General Results of Amputations of the Upper Limh.—Amputations of the upper extremity, even for injury, are extremely successful. In the Crimea, amputations of the fore-arm were fatal in the ratio of 5, and those of the arm ot per cent. The table at p. 50, in the last chapter, gives a mortality of Fig. 37. —Amputation at Shoulder hy Spence’s Metliod. S4'4 per cent, for traumatic amputations of the upper arm, and of 10’5 per ■cent, for amputation of the fore-arm. At Guy’s Hospital, Bryant states that traumatic amputations of the fore-arm were fatal in the ratio of 10, and those •of the upper arm of 22 per cent. At University College, in Liston’s and my practice, of 12 traumatic amputations of the upper arm, there ivere 5 deaths ; whilst of 8 in ivhich the fore-arm was removed, all recovered. The cause of ■death is usually pymmia, erysipelas, or congestive pneumonia. Amputations of the fore-arm and ai’m for disease, more particularly for sti’umous affections of the bones and joints, are A'cry successtul operations. ■When they are done for malignant disease, the risk is greater. In the table already refeiTed to, the mortality after amputation of the arm for disease is 26 per cent., and of the fore-arm 15’9 per cent. Amputation.at the shoulder-joint for injury, although necessarily moic fatal, is very successful for so severe a procedure. In 46 recorded^ cases in ciUl practice, there were 26 deaths, or 56’5 per cent., Avhile of 607 cases in military surgery, 294, or 48'4 per cent., died. In the drench aimy in the

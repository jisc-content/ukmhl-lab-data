593 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SPINE. portion of the spine is, undoubtedly, either the continuance of the inflamma- tion excited by the injury in the cord and its membranes, or its increase or tlevelopment by the operation itself. Dislocations of the Spine.—On looking at the arrangement of the arti- cular surfaces of the vertebra), the very limited motion of which they are susceptible, and the way in which they are closely knit together by strong ligaments and short and powerful muscles, it is obvious that dislocations of these bones must be excessively rare. So seldom, indeed, do they occur that their existence has been denied by many Surgeons. Yet there are a suffi- cient number of instances on record to prove that these accidents may happen. Those cases that have been met ivith have usually been associated with partial fracture, but this complication is not necessary. In all, the displacement was incomplete ; and, indeed, a complete dislocation cannot occur. Fracture may occin anywhere in the spine, but dislocation ivithout, or vdth very slight, fractine is exceedingly rare. Dislocation of the spine may occm- in the follow- ing parts. 1.

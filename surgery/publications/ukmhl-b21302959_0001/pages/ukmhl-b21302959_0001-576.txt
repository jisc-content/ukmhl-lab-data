ns JURIES OF THE HEAD. 548 Tlie Symptoms of a dcpressod fracture of the fikidl arc of two kinds ; those that are dependent npon the injury to the bone, and those that result from the coucomitant compression or laceration of the brain. AVhen the scalp is not wounded, the depression may sometimes be felt; but TCi'y commonly it is masked by extravasation of blood about it, and the Surgeon is only led to suspect its existence by the continuance of symptoms of compression from the time of the injury. In all cases of doubt, when these symptoms exist, an incision should be made through the scalp at the seat of injury and the state of the skull examined. When there is a wound in the scalp ’communicating with the fracture, the Sin-geon detects at once the existence of depression and commimrtion by examinmg the bone A^ith his finger through the wound. When the fragments that arc depressed are im- pacted and firmly locked together, so as to form an imyieldmg mass, s^ptoms of compression of the brain, to a more or less marked degree, nsnaUy result But if the fracture be very extensive, and the fragments, though somewhat depressed, lie loose, and if they be yielding and do not exercise a continuous pressure on the brain, it occasionally happens that no ccrebral^ disturbance comes on for some days, even though the injmy be very exteiwve.

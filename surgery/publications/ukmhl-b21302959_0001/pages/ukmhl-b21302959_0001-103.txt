AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER-JOINT. 75 the slioulcTer-joiiit. The incision ought to expose the tendon of tlie long head of the biceps lying parallel to it and at its bottom. This may be turned on one side, and the joint opened and examined ; and if from the state of the parts it 1 1 I i I Fig. 35.—Amxiutation at the Shoulder-joiut. Holding Vessels in the Inner Flap. be still considered necessary to amputate, the operation is completed by making* an oval incision through the skin from the end of the original ent, taking- care not to go so deeply on the inner side as to vound the vessels. The outer flap is then dissected up, so as to enable the Sm’geon to get his knife internal to the head of the bone, between it and the axillaiy arteiy (Fig. 37). The assistant follows the knife with his hands, and grasps the I'essels, and the operation is finished by dividing the tissues left imcut at the ini\er side. In those cases in Avhich this operation is peiformed for disease, especially for timionr of the humenis, by which the soft parts arc thinned or condensed, it may very conveniently be done liy making tlie anterior flap by dis- secting it up fr’om without inwards, using of course for this pmiiose a short knife ; a broad bistoury is most convem’ent. The joint is then opened, and the posterior flap formed in the Fig. so.-stump after Amputation at usual way. In tin’s way I have easily performed the shouuicr-joint. amputation at the shoulder-joint for large tumours of the head of the humerus.

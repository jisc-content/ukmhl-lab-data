PEEPACE TO THE SEVENTH EDITION. Tpie favour with which successive Editions of this Work have been received not only b}’’ the Profession in this country and its colonies, but by means of Reprints in the United States of America, and through the medium of translations on the Continent of Europe, gratifying as it necessarily is to the Author, has in no small degree increased his responsibilities. The Author feels that a responsibility, weighty in proportion to the very extent of the diffusion of his Instruction, is incurred by him who takes upon himself the task of teaching others that Science which underlies the Art, and that Art, the exercise of which constitutes the application to Practice of a great branch of Medical Knowledge, which more directly than any other department of Medicine involves the physical well-being, and more immediately affects the life of those on whom it is exercised. It is not sufficient for the Teaching of a Scientific Art, such as Surgery, to be sound in those General Laws that constitute its Principles. It ^ must also be accurate in those minute details that are necessary to its successful Practice, and, above all, just in its estimate of the labours of others. A leaclier of Surgery, who seeks to give a true and impartial view of the subject of his tuition, is placed in much the same position as a Judge who is summing up a great cause. He must endeavour to divest himself of the trammels of the Schools to free himself alike from the partisanship of individual bias and the antagonism of professional prejudice.

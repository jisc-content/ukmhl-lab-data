AMPUTATION AT THE WRIST. 69 Accurately together in the way described on p. 41, Fig. 11. By this metliod the dorsal flap is somewhat long and thin, and is consequently liable to slough, unless Fig. 2S.—Ainxmtatiou of tlio Wrist ty Tealc's JletUoil. it be very caicfully raised, care being taken not to turn the edge of the knife to the flap, but to keep it constantly directed towards the parts to be removed. In amputation by the long palmar flap, the operation has been performed, -either by cutting the flap from within ■or by shaping the flap from the pahn first and disarticulating afterwards. The former method is objectionable, as the prominence of the pisiform bone and the hook of the unciform ■on the inner side render its per- formance extremely difficnlt. In the latter method (Fig. 29) a large flap, almost square in shape, but having its angles rounded off, is marked out in the palm by an incision, com- mencing at one styloid process and terminating at the other. The flap should extend as far as the trans- verse fold in the pahn opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones. The flap liaA'ing been thus marked out, it is carefully raised ftom the palm, and is made to include e\-erything down to the flexor tendons. When the pahnar flap has been raised to tlie level of the wrist-joint, a curved incision, with its convexity slightly dowmivards, is made, so as to connect the two extremities of the previous incision. The joint is now opened. pards alter opening the wrist-jomt. Fig. 29.—Amputiitioii at tlie Wrist by Long Falninr Fl.ap and the ligaments divided. The hand

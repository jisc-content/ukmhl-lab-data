850 VENEREAL BISEASES. lci\oiu, cUkI lifts been extensively tried. Of late years, however, a reaction has taken place in the minds ot most professional men, and mercury is again employed in the treatment of this disease, hut more moderately and scientifically, and consequently more successfully than before. The arguments in the favour of the non-mercurial plan of treatment are briefly these : that by this system of treatment the constitution of the patient is saved the introduction of a mineral which in many cases acts injuriously, and which, as the disease can be cured without it, may at all events be looked upon as unnecessary ; that secondary affections less frequently follow this plan than they do the administration of meremy ; and, lastly, that those distressing cases of constitutional syphilis which are common after mercurial com’ses, and which are said to depend upon a peculiar combination of the syphilitic poison vuth the mineral in the system, are never met with in persons who have under- gone the simple treatment. These arguments, however, on closer examination find fm’ther experience, have been proved to be not quite so conclusive as the supporters of the simple treatment appear to believe. That a great number, perhaps the majority, of cases of simple soft chancre, which we now know to be an affection of a totally distinct nature from syphilis, can be healed vfithout the administration of merciuy, is undoubtedly the fact ; but it is equally true in many instances that the indm’ated sore does not cicatrise properly unless the mineral be administered, or, if it do close, that it heals in an imperfect manner, readily breaking out agaiu. But it is a most serious error to confound the healing of ulcers with the cime of syphilis. The cicatrisation of an ulcer and neutrahsation of the constitutional affection are two distinct things ; and the test of the relative value of these two plans of treatment must depend rather on the influence they have over the coiu’se of syphilis, and on the character that the symptoms assume under one or other of these methods, than on the mere skinning over of the ulcer. I cannot agree with the statement that secondary symptoms are less frequent after the simple than after the mercurial treatment of syphihs. I have seen the non-mercurial plan of treatment very extensively employed at University College Hospital; indeed, it was formerly almost invariably practised there, more particularly in the syphilitic cases occuriing among the out-patients under Morton, who strongly advocated it ; and I have had repeated occasion to observe the frequency with which it was followed by secondary symptoms. In private practice, also, I have had considerable oppor- tunities of comparing the two methods ; and I can safely say that I have seen the simple treatment more frequently followed by secondary symptoms than the mercurial plan has been, when properly and judiciously employed. The supporters of the non-mercurial treatment, when obliged to admit the great frequency vdth which it is followed by secondary symptoms, argue that these, if more frequent, are less severe after the simple than after the^ mercurial plan ; and they state somewhat dogmatically, and it appears to me without any evidence to support their statement, that mercixry and syphilis together form a sort of ]poisonous compound in the system, which produces the worst and most destiuc- tive forms of constitutional syphilis. I deny entirely, however, that we have any proof of the existence of such a combination as that winch is supposed to be produced by syphilis and mercury ; no evidence with which I am acquainted has ever been adduced in support of the formation of such a poison in the

35° INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. Tt is this depth in the limb at which the abscess is seated that gives rise to the difficulty in its detection, the violent constitutional distuihances it occasions, and its extreme danger. I have never seen abscess fomi amongst the muscles of the leg as a consequence of injuries of the knee-joint, unless the tibia had been fractm-ed as well as the joint opened. For the penetration of the knee-joint by needles, see p. 217. Woimds of the Elbow and Ankle-joints, when simple, as in punctures, usually admit of closure and of being healed, leaving a sufficiently useful and mobile articulation. When they are complicated with fractiwe of the neigh- bouring bones, the soft parts not being too extensively injured, resection of the injured articulations is the proper coiu'se to adopt, followed by antiseptic di’essings and good drainage ; if there be much laceration of soft parts with comminution of the bones, amputation, especially in the case of the ankle, will be reqm'red. Wounds of the Wrist-joint are peculiarly dangerous, on account of the extent and complexity of the synovial membrane that enters into its confor- mation. Should suppiu’ation be set up, some of the cai-pal bones may necrose, and thus amputation may be rendered imperative ; or, if this be averted, a stiff and comparatively useless hand will be left. Dislocations will be described in Chapter XXII.

THE PROCESS OF REPAIR. • 178 \vc luue hitherto dealt, that are not without influence on the processes of repair in wounds : ^ the age, temperament, previous state of health and cousti- tutioii of the patieiit,^ his occupation and usual mode of life, the situation in which he is placed after the receipt of the injury, and many other matters, must all more^ or less afiect the result. Those states of the system, for instance, in which there is a tendency to the fomation of coi-pusciilar Ijonph, or to suppinative iiiflammatioii, such as the scrofulous or scorbutic diatheses, or where amyloid degeneration of the liver, or disease of the kidneys, &c., is present, must always militate against rapidity and perfection of ciu-e! Habits of nitemperance and over-indulgence, privation, exposure, bad sanitary and hygienic conditions, are all alike antagonistic to reparative action. These are points to which the Smgeon’s attention must be directed, nith the Hew of counteracting them as far as lies in his power by appropriate iirecautioiis and treatment.

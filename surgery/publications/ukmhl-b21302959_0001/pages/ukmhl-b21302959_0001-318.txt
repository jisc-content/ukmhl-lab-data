ARHEST OF ARTERIAL ILEMORRIIAGE. 290 cause it to be wounded. The artery having thus been exposed, the Siu’gcou seizes one edge of the sheath with the forceps, and, putting it on the stretch, proceeds to clean the artery, gently separating it from its accompanying vein by teazmg through the areolar connections nnth a director; being careful not to expose it to a greater extent than is absolutely necessary for the passage of the ligatin’e, lest subsequent sloughing of the vessel ensue, as a consequence of the destruction of the vas- cidar connections between it and the sheath (Fig. 116), but at the same time being careful to clean thoroughly the part to be tied. In opening the sheath, care should be taken not to wound any small branch, lest the collateral supply be interfered Fig. 115.—Exposure with, and danger of secondary hsemoiThage induced. The sheathr'“"° edge in the opening of the sheath being held tightly in the forceps so as to be rendered tense (Fig. 117), the ligatm-e should then be carefully passed between the vein and artery, care being taken to include only ^'ti ^'vessels ^'5' HT.—Passage of tlie Xeedle and Ligature, exposed. the latter, and especially not to transfix and include a portion of the vein ; an accident that often terminates fataUy by phlebitis or gangrene. So also the Smgeon must be on his guard not to mistake any contiguous nerve for the artery, as has happened to the most experienced operators ; and also to aAoid transfixing and tying a portion of the thickened sheath instead of the vessel, as I have known happen to a most excellent Siu’geon. n t t ? ^ The Tyinri of the Artery and the consequent Division of the Internal ana Middle Coats shoidd be done evenly, smoothly, and compl^ely, so as Jo leave a wound that reatlily Ukes on tho adhesive inflammation. This is best done bj a small round ligature, applied with sueh a degree of force that tte Siii M feels the inner and middle coats give way under his finger. Tims a silt

AMPUTATION BY TEE CIRCULAR METIIOV. 37 as ibiassthetics are now trusted to for securing immunity from suffering, rapidity is of less importance than it was formerly. Hence many inethod^ ot amputating that wore discarded a quarter of a century ago have regained then- ascendancy, and Surgeons now deliberately carve out flaps by cutting h’oni ivithoiit inwards, regardless of the gi-eater length of time reqmred, provided the result is more satisfactory. . Amputation by the Circular Method.—In this amputation, the slau and tat are fli-st diHdod by a single sweep of the knife and dissected up for a distance equal to half the diameter of the limb ; the muscles are then divided by another circular sweep of the knife and retracted for a distance varying fl’om one to two inches, according to the thickness of the limb ; and the bone is saivn as high up as possible. In the thigh and leg it vas recommended by Hey to cut the posterior muscles longer than the anterior, to allow for their greater contraction. The edges of the skin are brought together in the trans- vei-se diameter of the limb, and a stump is formed with abundant covering for the bones, but necessarily vdth some puckering and projection at each angle. Diu-ing the late Franco-Priissian war, the circular was - the method almost universally adopted by the German sm-geons ; the advantages they claim for it ”•—Amimtatlou of the Ann by the Circular Method. Sawing the Bone. being that much less care is required in the after-treatment than in the flap method, as the covering to the bones, containing no muscle, is less liable to be displaced, and the patients will consequently bear transportation from the fleld hospitals at an earlier period, a matter of no small importance in military

BEMOYAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 623 the stomach, it had better be left to pass thi'ough the intestines, T\Tien it is thus left, the patient should neither take purgath'es nor opiates. Both are injiu-ious : the purgatives by increasing the imtation of the bowels and the chance of their being wounded by sharp and projecting points from the plate ; the opiates by arresting its progress. The better plan is to keep the patient in bed, perfectly quiet, and to give him an abundance of pultaceous food. By adopting this plan I have succeeded in getting a gold plate, with three molar teeth and a sharp cmwed clasj)ing hook at each end, to pass without the slightest difficulty or pain four days after it was swallowed by a gentleman about 25 years of ago. No attempt need ever be made to extract small coins from the stomach, as they viU always easily j)ass through the intestinal canal.

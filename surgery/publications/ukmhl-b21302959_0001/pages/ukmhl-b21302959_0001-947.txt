ELEPHANTIASIS. 919 many tropical countries, in the West Indian Islands and in South America more particularly. It is met with, though comparatively rarely, in Europe. The disease usually affects one of the lower extremities (seldom both), the scrotum, or the labia, which may become enormously enlarged and hyper- trophied. In the face it is often met with ; in the upper extremities rarely. It is not my intention to enter into an account of the history, the symptoms, or the causes of this remarkable malady. It is sufficient for my purpose here to say,' that it appears to consist in disease primarily seated in the lymphatics. The glands, as Virchow and Eindfleisch suppose, become impervious to the transmission of lymph, and the hyperplastic deposits that characterise the disease are the consequence, together with the general stretching and hypertrophy of the integumental structure, of the plastic effusion into the areolar tissue. Treatment.—When this disease attacks the face, little, if anything, avails in the way of treatment. When it affects the labia and scrotum, the enlarged and diseased part must be removed. But when the leg is affected, surgery can effect much in the way of cure. In the slighter cases much may be done by eleva- tion of the limb, methodical bandaging, and perhaps, as Eayer and Lisfranc recommend, the employment of scarification. But in the more severe cases, where the hmb has swollen to a monstrous size, and has become shapeless from the groin to the ankle, the skin sallow, covered with nodules and overlaid by a branny desquamation, with a tendency to unhealthy and incurable ulcerations —^in these advanced and serious cases, more active measures are necessary. Dufour seems to have been the first to propose diminution of the supply of arterial blood to the limb as a cure for this disease. This he effected by com- pressing the femoral artery by means of a kind of truss, and was successful in four cases. This practice of compression has since been successfully followed by Hill, Cockle, Vanzetti, and others. TABLE I. Talle of Ligature of Femoral Artery for Elephantiasis. SURGEON. SEX. AGE.

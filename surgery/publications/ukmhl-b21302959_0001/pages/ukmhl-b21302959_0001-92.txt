In operating from the palmar aspect, the finger should be forcibly extended as soon as the flap is made, when, it the knife be applied to the lateral ligaments, the synoAial siu-face will show itself. Amputation is performed between the proximal and second phalanges m the same way ; but, as a general rule, it should not be done here ; because, as no flexor tendon is attached to the proximal phalanx, it is apt to remain pciina- nently extended, and a good deal in the patient’s way. In the case ot the index finger, however, it will be better to leave the proximal phalanx, the stump of which forms an usefril opponent to the thumb.

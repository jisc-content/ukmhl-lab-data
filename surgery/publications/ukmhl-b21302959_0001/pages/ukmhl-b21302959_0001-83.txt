55 IXJURY AXD DISEASE. campaign of 1859, according- to the same authority, there were 4G cases of amputation of the thigh at the iipper third, with 43 deaths, or P®'„ ^ ;V> at the middle third, with a mortality of 44, or 84 per cent.; and 43 at the lower third, udth 3G deaths, or 83 per cent. Again, among 21 amputations of the hiunerus at the neck in the French army in the Crimea, the mortality was 9 or 43 per cent. ; in 229 at the upper third, it was G2, or 27 per cent.; in 145 at the middle third it was 27, or 18 per cent.; and in 55 at the lower third it was G, or 11 per cent. _ i Not only do the size of the part remoYcd, and its proximity to the ti-unS:, influence materiaUy the general mortahty after amputation; but these conditions also influence the particular cause of death. Thus after the smaller amputations, as of a toe, for instanee, death ocem-s only in imhealthy states of the constitution, from the occun’ence of erysipelas, or of some of the various forms of diffuse inflammation. Death after the larger amputations more fr-equently results from causes eonneeted -with the operation itself, as, for instance, secondai-y htemon-hage, shock, or exhaustion by the abstraction of the large quantity of blood contained in the limb, as well as by that lost during the operation. After the removal of the whole of a limb, as in the case of amputation at the hip-joint, it is possible that the cause suggested by Cox, viz., the remoA’al of a limb in which the blood undergoes changes of importanee to the rest of the economy, may materially affect the lesult. 2. The Part of the Bone that is sawn through may influence the result. Amputations through the eancellous ends of long bones are less dangerous, in one respect, than those through their shafts, in consequence of the medullary canal not being opened when the section is made near the articular end ; so that the liabihty to diffuse suppuration of this caAuty, and consecutive phlebitis and pytemia, is diminished. 3. The mortality resulting from amputations is perhaps more directly in- fluenced by whether the operation is done for Injury or Disease, than by any other cause, being far greater in corresponding limbs after injury than disease, except as regards amputation of the fore-arm. In the following table may be seen the results of 307 eonsecutfr'e cases of amputation performed at University College Hospital up to May, 1871. Of these 307 cases, 79 died, yielding as 3ieai-ly as possible a mortality of 25 per eent. Since the publication of these, 80 additional amputations have been performed up to May, 1873. Of these 387, exactly 100 have died, being at the rate of 25'8 per cent. The rate of mortality has throughout, under many different modes of treatment, been .singularly steady, ranging betAveen 23*5 and 25'5 per cent. RESULTS OF AMPUTATION IN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL.

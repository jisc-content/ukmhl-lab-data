The first is by means of N^laton’s line ; the second, by Bryant’s ilio-femoral triangle. Uelatou’s Diagnostic line (Big. 180, dark line) consists of a line diavn from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the tuber ischii. If the tro- chanter be at its proper level, this line ought to touch its upper border. The importance of this fine is, that when the head of the femur is in its nor- mal situation, it touches the summit of the tro- chanter in every position of the limb. If the tro- chanter be displaced in any direction, a corresponding- change in its relation to this fine will ensue. Bryant’s Ilio-femoral triangle (Fig. 180, dotted line) is formed by placing the patient in the recumbent position; then, drawing a line from the anterior superior spine of the ilium perpendicularly downwards, another line also from the anterior superior spine obliquely to the summit of the trochanter, and a third, or the base line, horizontally backwards from this to the perpendicular line, a triangle AviU thus be formed. The oblique line corresponds to the first part of N^laton’s line (Fig. 180), and may be taken, just as Ndaton’s, as the diagnostic line for dislocations of the head of the femur backwards ; whilst Bryant’s base line is the test-line for all cases in which the neck of the femur is shortened, or the head of the bone thromi upwards.

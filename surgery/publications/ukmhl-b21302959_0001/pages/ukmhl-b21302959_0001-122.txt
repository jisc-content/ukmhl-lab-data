If the cartilage be left on the' femur it should also be allowed to remain imdisturbed on the patella. But if it^be removed from the femur so as to expose the cancellous bone, then the inner surfece of the iiatella should be removed in a similar mamier, before the flap is laid down. This null be found to furnish an excellent covering to the bone ; the patella, and the thick, tough, and extensile integuments of the knee, forming a good basis^ of support for the limb to bear upon, and one well adapted for pressime. The cut smface of the patella wiU apply itself to and unite nith the cauceUons surfaces of the condyles, and thus add to the solidity of the end of the stump. 3. S. Smith, of New York, amputates at the knee by Lateral Flaps in the following way. The incision is commenced about an inch below the tubercle of the tibia, and is carried downwards and forwards over the most prominent part of the side of the leg, until it reaches the under surface, where it is directed Figi GO.— Anijiutation at Knee by Lateral Flap. towards the median line. When this point is reached, it is cairied directly upwards to the centre of the articulatiou. A second incision begins at the same point as the first, and inmsues a similar direction on the opposite side of the limb ; the two incisions meeting in the median line behind. The inner flap should be rather the larger ; and the patella is left. After this amputation, the stump presents the aiipearance represented in Fig. 60. Amputation through the Condyles may be done by a long posterior or a long anterior flap, including the patella or not; or by a modification of the cir-

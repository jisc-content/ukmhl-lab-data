898 DISEASES OF TIIL NERVOUS SYSTEM. or partially excised, iir eases of persistent traumatic neuralgia. The larger nervous trunks, such as the median, musculo-spiral, and ulnar, have been tieated in the same way in the upper ; aud the external popliteal, and even the sciatic nerve in the lower limb, has been partially excised as a last resource in extreme cases. These operations have in some cases effected a permanent cure, in others they have been followed by temporary I’elief only. It was reserved for Sands, of New York, to remove a section of the whole brachial plexus close to the exit of the nerves from the spinal column. This was done in a lad aged eighteen, whose right arm had been seriously injured in firing a salute. The arm was amputated, but the patieut suffered the most agonizing torture from chronic nerve-lesion high up iu the limb. So great were his sufferings that he became uncontrollable in his actions, and, though perfectly sane, gave way to fits of the most intense excitement. The operation consisted in making an incision along the outer border of the right stenio-niastoid, and a transverse one following the line of the clavicle. The J-shaped flap was tinned up, the carotid sheath and its contents carried to one side, and the brachial plexus exposed. A piece fully a quarter of an inch in length was cut out from the four lower cenical and first dorsal nerves, fr’om Fig. 329.—Section from Lower Cord of Brachial Plexus near Intervertebral Foramina, showing the lesioris which Fig. 329 has been taken. Considerable improvement, though not com- plete relief from suffering, followed the operation. Stretching of Nerves.—Nussbaum has the great merit of haviug introduced Seguin).

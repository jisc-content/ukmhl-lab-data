229 SPLINTERS. of lend were loft on the rough snrfoce of the china (Fig. 89). Bullet-detectors have tdso been contrived, in which, by an an’angement of two isolated metal probes in a cannula connected ^nth a galvanometer, the galvanic circuit is completed when the bullet is touched, and the needle of the galvanometer, deflected ; or, instead of the latter instrument, the ordinary telegraph alarum may be interposed. For the remo^'al of bullets, long and strong forceps are required, the action of which may be aided by a screw-probe. The accom- pau}dng woodcuts (Figs. 90, 91, 02, 93, and 9d) represent the best forms of bullet-screws, forceps, and extractors. 9 > Fig. 89. Frobe.

The splmte^'s produced by the passage of a ball throngh'a bone are more numerous and larger, Avhon the injmy has been inflicted with a conical rifle- a 1. The impetus of this projectile is so great, and its wedge-like action so estructive, that the bone struck is shattered into a mmiber of fragments, as longitudinally, often to a gxeat extent. These fragments ai’e e ached, to a greater or less extent from their comicctioiis with the soft parts tLhrT^'^ ® who rvas fond of systema- ary, and tefrlmry. By primary splinters are meant those which are

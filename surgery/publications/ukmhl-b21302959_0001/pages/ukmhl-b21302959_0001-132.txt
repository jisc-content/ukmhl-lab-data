104 SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. (Fig. G8). By grasping the flap tightly, there will be but little risk of ha3niorrhage from the femoral artery, even when the abdominal aorta has not been compressed by the application of the tourniquet; but lest this should shp, or the assistant whose duty it is to grasp the flap by any chance should fail in holding it properly, it may be well to direct one of the assistants, whose business it is to steady the trunk, to have his thumb well pressed dovm into the ihac fossa, so as to compress the artery against the brim of the pehas. As the posterior flap is being made, the bleeding from the gluteal and sciatic vessels, which is often very free, may be arrested by two assistants who should be ready to cover and compress them Avith the fingers or dry sponges. Ihc arteries may then be ligatined one by one, as the assistant raises Ins fingers fr-om them If the other assistant haA^e good hold of the femoral, the vessels in the posterior flap may be tied first; but if the femoral be insecurely held, it must be first tied. The femoral arteries, both superficial and deep, will be found to be cut long, and to project fr’om the muscles, by Avhich they are surrounded, so as A’ery readily to be seized by the ingcis oi puUed out, and ligatimed. The ai-teries in the postenor flap inner side of the joint AA'ill be found in the inter-miiscu ai sep a. . le aps are to be brought together by six or eight sutures, an a caa oiij, s ups of plaster. The turn of a broad bandage may then be passed round t e abdomen, and the end brought up from behind undei t c s ump so as o support the flaps.

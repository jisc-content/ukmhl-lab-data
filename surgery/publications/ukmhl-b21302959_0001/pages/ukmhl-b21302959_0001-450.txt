In another case which I have since dissected, the muscles chiefly at fault Avere the radial extensors ; next to these the extensors of the thumb ; the supi- nator lougus being but slightly if at all contracted. Besides this injury, E,. W. Smith has described a fracture of the lower end of the radius in consequence of falls upon the back of the hand, in which the inferior fragment is displaced forwards. In these cases the character of the deformity indicates the natine of the injiny. It can readily be reduced, with a feeling of crepitation, by traction. In another variety of fracture in this situation, the lower end of the radius and that of the ulna are broken off, resembling very closely dislocation of the wi’ist backwards. But the existence of grating, the ready reduction of the swelling, and the attachment of the styloid processes of the radius and of the ulna to the carpus, with which they move, will be sufficient to establish the diagnosis. The Treatment of the ordinary fracture of the radius near the wi’ist is best conducted by the apparatus (Figs. 170,171). This consists of a pistol-shaped wooden splint, which is placed along the outside of the arm, reaching fi’om the elbow to the extremity of the fingers. Forcible extension and counter- extension should be practised, with the view of disentangling the ft-agments, and removing the dorsal prominence. The splint should be cai’efuUy padded, the padding being made thicker opposite the lower fragment, and then, noth the straight portion held vertically, the head of the splint should be fixed to the back of the hand. Gentle extension should then be made, and the hand bent to the ulnar side by raising the straight portion of the splint to the horizontal Fig. 170.—OW Pistol-Splint for Treatment of Fi'actiu'e of the Lower End of the Eadius.

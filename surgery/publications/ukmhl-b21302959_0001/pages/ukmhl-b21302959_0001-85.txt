AMRUTATIONS. 57 riilMARY AXn SECONDARY run into suppuration, both in it and m the tissues g-eneiaUy. ^ disease has once become chronic, the precise period at which performed exercises but little influence on the mortality, provided it be not le- fen-ed to too late a stage, when the patient’s constitution is worn out by hectic Amputations of expediency—those performed for the coiiveuieiice of the patient, as in cases of talipes or ankylosis, but not necessary, so far ^ me is concerned-are especially fatal. Bryant has shomi that, at Guys Hospital, death has followed in 40 per cent, of these amputations of the lower extremity. 5. In amputation in cases of injmy an important question has to be detei-mined, viz., the influence exercised by the Time that has elapsed from the infliction of the iiijiuy to the performance of the amputation. Aot oidy the rate of mortahty, but the conditions that immediately occasion the fatal event, are infliieneed by the period at which the operation is performed. Amputations for injury are commonly divided by siu’geons into Pt immy and Secondary; the fTimary being those that are performed during the first BESULTS OF PBIMAEY AND SECONDABY AMPUTATIONS IN CASES OF INJUEY, AT UNIVEESITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL.

By secondary amputations, many Siu’geons mean those operations that are practised after the first twenty-foiu’ hoiu’s; whilst others again restrict the term to those that are done after suppimation has been set up in the limb, calling those amputations intermediate that are performed between these two periods, viz., from the twenty-fomih hour to the occiUTence of suppuration, and which consequently occupy a very extensive range. I think, however, that this distinction is somewhat trivial, and not very easily applied in practice ; and that it is better to include under the term secondary, all amputations performed after inflammatory action has been set up in the injured part. ^he subjoined table, collected fr’om various sources, shows the relative results of primaiy and secondaiy operations in civil practice.

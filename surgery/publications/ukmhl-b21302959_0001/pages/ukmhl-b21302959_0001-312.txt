284 ARREST OF ARTERIAL ILEMORRIIAGE. inodes of arresting the haemorrhage as tlic employment of tlic axetnal cautery, the performance of operations ndth red-hot knives, or the application of boiling pitch, or of molten lead, to the bleeding and freshly cut surface. About the middle of the sixteenth century, it was revived or reinvented by that great luminary of the French school of Surgery, Ambroise Par6. But so slowly did the ligatiu’c make way, that Sharpe, Surgeon to Guy’s Hosjiital, writing in 1701, two centmies after its re-introduction by Par6, found it necessary, in his well-known work, entitled, “A Critical Enquiry into the Present State of Simgcry,” formally to advocate its employment for the amst of hasmorrhage from wounded arteries, in jircference to styptics or the cautery, on the groimd that “ it was not as yet universally practised amongst Sm-geons residing in the more distant counties of our kingdom.” 'V\Tiat, it may be asked, was the reason that it took two centmies to promulgate the use of the simplest and most efficacious means we possess in smgery for the arrest of heumorrhage—a simple tying up of a spoutmg artery—a means that no Surgeon could now for a day dispense vith ? The reason simply was, that Siu’gcons were totally ignorant of the means employed by Natme for the occlusion of arteries ; that they consequently did not know how to apply a ligatime to these vessels, or what kind of ligatme should be used ; and that, in their anxiety to avoid the rcciu’rence of secondary hEemorrhage, and to make aU safe, they fell into the very errors they would have endeavomed to avoid, had they been acquainted vith the physiology of the processes by which Nature accomplishes the closure of the artery and the separation of the thread. Between twenty and thirty years after the time at which Shai*pe VTote, Hunter introduced that gi’eat improvement in the surgical treatment of aneiu’ism—the deligation of the artery at a distance from the sac, and in a healthy part of its coiu’se ; but this great accession to the treatment of a most formidable disease was but coldly received, and ran some risk of being lost to the world in consequence of the ill-success that attended the earher operations. In Hunter’s ffi’st operation, four ligatiu’es were used, all of which were applied so slackly as merely to compress the artery for some distance, in order to avoid too gTeat a degree of pressime at any one point; the artery was denuded, so that a spatula could be passed under it. Although in his subsequent operations Hiuiter contented himself with employing but one ligature, yet sometimes the vein was included in this ; and he did not draw the noose tight for fear of injm-ing the coats of the vessel, in accordance vdth the doctrine of the day— Surgeons generally at this tune being haiuited with the dread of injiuing, and thereby weakening, the coats of the artery; and, in order to avoid doing so, they adopted modes of treatment that almost infallibly led to ulceration of the '\’esscls and consecutive hcemorrhage. The application of seveial ligatmes of reserve, applied slack—the use of broad tapes the intei’position of plugs of cork, wood, agaric, or lead, or of rolls of hut or plaster, between the thread and the vessel, were some amongst the plans that were in common use. And how can we be siu’prised that the patients pciished of haemoiihage, and that hgatime of the vessel was nearly as inefficient and fixtal a means of arresting bleeding as the use of a cautery, or ot a button of white Aitiiol ? Jones, by an appeal to experiment, and by means of a series of admiia^ y conducted investigations on living animals, showed that the veiy point w uc

SPEC IA L DISLOCA TIONS. 496 mis muscle (Fig. i24). Tlieso arc the four forms of the dislocation of the hip stated by Sir A. Cooper to be the most usual, and this statement has been fully confirmed by the accumulated experience of more modern Surgeons. Besides these, liou'ever, may be added, as not very unfrequent, that form in which the bone is thrown backwards and somewhat downwards behind the DISLOCATIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE THIGH-BONE, Fig. 223.—Upwards and Fig. 224.—Baolnvards somowliatBaokwai'ds, into Sciatic Notch, on Dor.smn Ilii.

In addition to these, other less common forms of dislocation have been noticed : for instance, one in which the head of the bone lies between the anterior superior and the anterior inferior spinous processes of the ihum, or that in which it has been thiwn upon the spine of the ischium. , . ... . . The extent of mischief done to the soft parts around the joint lai-ies in different dislocations. In aU, the capsulai- ligament is torn in a gi-eater or less extent in the direction of the displacement. The extent and exact situa- tion of the laceration of the capsular ligament are matters of great nnportance, as on a con-ect appreciation of them depends in a great measure the facility or difficulty in reduction, and the means to be employed m effecting it.

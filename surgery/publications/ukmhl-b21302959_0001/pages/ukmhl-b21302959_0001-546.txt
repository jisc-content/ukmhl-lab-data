518 SPECIAL DISLOCATIONS. in my practice, in one of wiiicli, by the pressure of a “ turn-table ” on a rail- way, the outer three metatarsal bones were dislocated downwards. In the other, in consequence of a horse falling and rolling on its rider, there were a compound dislocation of the first and a simple dislocation of the fourth meta- tarsal bone. The question of amputation will always present itself in these cases, and must be determined on general principles, by the age of the patient, and the extent of injiny to the soft parts. Luxations of the Phalanges of the Toes but rarely happen, and present nothing special in nature or treatment.

OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 2‘Jl traiisfnsiiig apparatus ^vith warm A\'atcr ; the second, by not alloAving’ tlie blood to coagulate in it. The blood may be defibriiiated Avithout losing its properties as a restoratiA'c ; and in the event of proper transfusing apparatus not being aA'ailable, and the Surgeon haA'ing to use an ordinary hydrocele or aspirator syi-inge, it Avonld only lie Avise to take this in’ecaution. Panum, of Copenhagen, has clearly shoAAm by numerous experiments that the fibrine is not in any Avay necessary to the sirccess of the operation. He recommends that the blood be draAvn into a cup kept Avarm in a basin of hot Avater. It is then to be Avell AA’hipped, filtered through a fine cloth, and injected. The essential part of the blood is the red corpuscles, AAiiich are Avanted to serA-e as can-iers of oxygen. The remoA'al of the fibrine in this AA'ay materially facilitates the operation, Avhich is otherwise attended by some difficulty OAAdng to the liability to coagulation of the blood in the transfusing apparatus, or by danger from embolism from the injection of coagulum into the veins. If transfusion be determined on, it should not be delayed until the last moment, Avhen the agony of death has already commenced ; as then the actions of the nervous and circulatory systems may be so impaired that the patient is no longer recoverable, or, if temporarily so, Avill speedily lapse into a state of ffital disease. The Local Treatment of hoemon-hage AA'ill be fully described in the next chapter.

IIE-BUEAKING OF BONES. 387 At a later period, when some weeks or months have elapsed, and the fracture has not united, the bones arc necrosing, and the patient is being Avorn out by hectic, amputation must be performed at any convenient moment, and is often done with great success if it be not deferred till too late ; for here tlic mischief is entirely local, and the constitution, suffering only by the debihty resulting from it, quickly rallies when the cause of this is removed, Bexdijcg, Rebkkakii^g, Resetting Bones.—It may happen, that at the end of two or three weeks a fractiu'ed bone is found in a position too faulty to be remedied by the natural process just described. At this period the bond of union is soft and yielding, and the displacement, if angular, may usually be remedied by frequent re-adjustment of the apparatus, and more particularly by bandaging the fr-actured fragments in opposite directions, or by the use of pads and pressure thus exercised on the extremities of the broken bones. If this period be allowed to pass by, and the fractiu’e be allowed to become con- sohdated, it may be found to be so ladly set that it is necessary to forcibly Eig. 140.—Butclier’s Clamp for Re-fractuviug Badly Set Bone. lend or break the caUus, in order to improve the condition of the limb.

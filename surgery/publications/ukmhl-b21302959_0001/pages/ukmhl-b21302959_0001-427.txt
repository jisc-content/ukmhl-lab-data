399 FRACTURE OF THE LOWER JAW. spliut should be made proportionately long. The teeth in these cases require special attention. Any that are loosened must he left in, as they will soon contract adhesions, and fix themselves firmly ; and, if necessary, they may he tied to the sonnd teeth with silver wire, or dentist’s silk. But, although metalhc wire is occasionally needed for the pm’pose of more acciu-ately fixing the Iragments, care must be taken that any tooth that may have been forced out of its alveolus and dropped between the fi’agments be removed from this situa- tion ; in one case where a tooth Avas overlooked in this position, no miion of the fractm-e took place till it had been removed. When depression, especially near the symphysis, is considerable, a clamp apparatus which ihxes the chin Fig. 103, tlie key. and line of teeth, invented by Lonsdale, ansv-ers the piu'pose of steadying the fragments extremely well. hen the fracture is double, one fissure occurring near the symphysis, the other near the angle, there is often A'ery considerable difficulty in bringing the fragments into anything like good position, ivithout the aid of some special apparatus. In such cases a metal plate should be acciu’ately moulded and fitted to the teeth, and attached to Lonsdale’s clamp or to a stem, and fixed to a horse-shoe shaped gutta-percha splint placed under the jaiv, so as to keep the whole steady and solid. Union generally takes place readily and very perfectly in fractures of the jaw, though it is somewhat slow at first, and the fragments continue mobile for some weeks. But the vascular supply of the bone is abundant, and reparative action correspondingly jyv-'i rcct. In all compound fractmes of the lower jaAv, H. 0. Thomas strongly advocates

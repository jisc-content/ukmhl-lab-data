AMPUTATIONS. 54 fr? P^^’ cent., died; whilst m the lower third the mortality out of GG cases was 87, or oG per cent. It needs no formal argimient to shoAv that the amputation of the toe or 0 the loot is less hazardous than that of the leg or the thigh. The subjoined table, derived from the examination of statistics of amputation in civil practice, collected fr’om various British, Continental, and American sources, shows clearly the increase in the ratio of mortality as the operation approaches the trunk.* SEAT.

Thus, ill the British army in the Crimea the percentages of death were, after amputation of the foreaim, 7 ; of the upper arm, 19 ; of the shoulder- joint, 35 ; of the foot, IG ; of the leg, 37 ; of the knee, 57 ; of the thigh, 64 ; and of the hip, 100 ; figures most creditable to the skill of the surgeons employed, but showing the progi’essive tendency to increase with the size of the limb removed. In the French army in the Crimea, the percentage of mortality after amputation of the fore-arm was 45 ; of the arm, 55 ; of the shoulder-joint, 61 ; of the foot, 76 ; of the leg, 72 ; of the knee-joint, 91 ; of the thigh, 92 ; and of the hip, 100. In the Italian campaign of 1859, the percentages of the mortality in the French army—including in some cases operations on ivoiuided Austrians—were : fore-arm, 42 ; arm, 56 ; shoulder- joint, 55 ; foot, 55 ; leg, 70 ; knee-joint, 75 ; thigh, 78 ; hip-joint, 57. In the war of the American rebellion the percentages of mortality were as follow, showing markedly how rapidly it runs up in accordance mth the size of the part removed : fingers and hand, 1-6 ; wist, 5'5 ; forearm, IG‘5 ; arm, 21-2 ; shoulder, 39'2 ; partial of foot, 9'2 ; ankle-joint, 13‘4 ; leg, 26 ; knee, 55 ; thigh, 64‘4 ; hip, 85*7. Not only is there this increase in the rate of mortality as the operation approaches the trunk, but in the larger limbs, more especially in the thigh, every additional inch that is removed appears to make a difference in this respect. Thus, in oiu- army in the Crimea, of 178 amputations of the thigh, 44 were in the upper third, and of these 38, or 86 per cent., proved fatal ; 68 were in the middle third, and of these 41, or 60 per cent., died ; whilst in the lower third the mortahty out of 66 cases was 37, or 56 per cent. In the French army in the Crimea, according to Chenu, of 81 amputations of the thigh at the upper third, 37, or 60 per cent., died ; in 91 amputations at the middle third, there were 63 deaths, or 69 per cent. ; and in the lower third there were 101 cases, wth 59 deaths, or 58'4 per cent.

From the lower end of each incision the knife is can’ied upwards to a point one inch beyond the angle of the month (A).

Defonnity of the Lower Lil'. deeply dissected np. The alveolar border of the middle portion is then fresh- ened. The lateral flaps (Fig. 108, C A) are now raised, united by twisted sutines in the mesial line, and supported as on a base by the middle flap, to which they are also attached by a few points of siitime, leading a triangular even sin- face (C C) to granulate. In addition to the division of the cicatrix, James, of Exeter, in these cases very successfully employed a screw-collar, by which the chin can be loosened from the sternum, and gi-adual extension of the cicatrux effected. In severe bunis of the side of the face and neck the resiilting cicatrix is sometimes so dense, resisting, and contracted, that immobility of the jan results and the month cannot be opened, or at most the teeth can only be separated to a slight extent, so as to admit liquid nourishment. ii to restore the mobility of the jaw and the power of sepaiating _ ^ ce in these cases, Bizzoli and Esmarch have proposed making a fiilse joint in the lower jaw on the side bimit, immediately in front of the cicatrix.

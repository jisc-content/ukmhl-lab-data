73 AMFUTATIOX at the SHOULDER-JOINT. (lowinvards, and, as soon as made, raised by the assistant. The heel of the knife is }io\v to be laid on the head of the bone, the capsule of the joint cut across, and the attachments of the muscles to the tuberosity dinded. In order Fig. 33.—Amputatiou at tlie Shoulder-joint hy Transfixion. to facilitate this part of the operation, it is generally recommended that the arm should be carried forcibly Inwards across the chest. This may readily be done in the dissecting-room, or in actual practice where the limb is removed for disease of the humerus, the bone being entire ; but in the case of com- minuted fractine of the humerus, Avith extensiA'e laceration of soft parts, it is useless to attempt this manoeuATe. In cases of this kind, the head and upper end of the humerus being broken off from the shaft, the lever-like action of the bone cannot be put in force, and it is sometimes not such an easy matter as might at fii’st appear, to detach its head from the glenoid caAity. In order to do this, I liaA’e in cases of comminuted fr'acture of the humerus, in Avhich I A\as amputating at the shoulder-joint, found it necessary, after opening the capsule, to seize hold ol the upper fragment and to draAV it forcibly doAviiAvards and outAvards by inserting the fingers betAA’een the head and the glenoid cavity, in order to divide the muscles inserted into it. After the head of the bone has been turned out of the glenoid caA'ity, the knife must be passed behind it, and cari'icd doAvn for a distance of about three inches close to the bone at its inner side (Fig. 34). The Singeon then cuts across the soft parts, so as to ioim the inner flap. In doing this, the assistant, to AAdiom this part is entrusted, must folloAV the knife with his hands, grasping firmly the aa’IioIo thickness of ttie inner flap, so as to compress the axillary artery, and thus prevent the

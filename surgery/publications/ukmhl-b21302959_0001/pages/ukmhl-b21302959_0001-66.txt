In some cases of malignant disease, also, when it is desirable not to approach too nearly to the diseased portion of the limb, the circular may be found a safer operation than the flap method, so far as the ultimate condition of the patient is concerned, in lessening the liability to recurrence. The oval method is especially applicable to certain amputations and disarti- culations of the bones of the hand and foot. It presents no advantage in the larger amputations. riap Amputation.—In performing flap amputations by transfixion, the Simgeon should stand so that he may support and grasp the limb to be removed ; the left hand being placed on the outer side in amputations of the left limbs, on the inner side in those of the right.

Scalpels, also, not too broad in the blade, are useful in cases in which the bistoury, from its length, might be inconvenient. Cutting-pliers, with long and strong handles and short blades, either straight or curved, as may be most convenient, are especially required in amputations

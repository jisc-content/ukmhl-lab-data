In amputation at the hip-joint, the great immediate danger to be appre- hended is excessive hiemon-hage, the incisions being made so high up that no ordinary tourniquet can be applied. By means of Lister’s compressor, the circulation through the abdominal aorta may be arrested, and thus the danger obviated. It is of great importance to perform the operation with as much rapidity as possible, and the disarticulation ought to be effected in at most thirty or forty seconds ; and it may be done in much less time than this. The an-est of the hiemorrhage during the operation must be intrusted to an assistant who can be fully relied on. After the abdominal compressor has been applied, and the floAV of blood through the aorta aiTcsted, liis business should be to compress the artery above the brim of the pelvis, and then to follow the knife in the first incision, and, as the anterior flap is being made, slip his fingers under it and gi-asp it firmly above and below, so as to compress the femoral artciy in it, Avhich is divided as the knife cuts its way out

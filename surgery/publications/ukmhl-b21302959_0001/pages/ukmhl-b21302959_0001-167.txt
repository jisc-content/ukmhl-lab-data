TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INFLiiMMATION. 139 is 2)inchecl up, and its base transfixed by a narrow-bladed bistoiuy. The blunt end of an eyed probe, threaded with the seton, is next pushed along the l)ack Fig. 70.—Introduction of a Seton. of the blade fi-om heel to point, which being withdrawn as the probe ik. carried onwards, the seton is left in the wound. A poultice should then be applied. The Actual Cautery is especially successfuil in deep-seated chronic inflam- mation, as of joints, when a deep and prolonged action is required to be set uj>. The cauterising irons may be of yai’ious shapes. They should be heated to a dull red heat, and then quickly drawn in lines, crossing one another, over the part. Astringents directly applied to the inflamed ^larts are of extreme service in those forms of congestive or passive inflammation in which the circulation is. sluggish and the cajiillaries loaded; they afford relief in these cases by inducing" conti-action of the vessels. In order to ensure their proper action, they must be employed of sufficient strength; for if too weak they irritate, and increase rather than relieve the congested condition. The nitrate of silver is the astrin- gent that IS commonly ineferred ; and this, apphed either solid, or in solution containing frorn ten gTains to one drachm of the salt in one ounce of distilled pl ater will produce a very marked beneficial influence in congestive inflamma- tion ot the mucous and cutaneous smfaces. _ Pressure by means of well-applied bandages, elastic webbing, or strapping, IS of essential semce in supporting the feeble vessels in congestive inflam- pressure may be advantageously conjoined with absorteuts and rubefacients, as mercurial and camphor liniments, or tho Hnii *^i finimoniacum. This treatment, by removing conges- usefnlTil*^ piomoting the absoi-ption of inflammatory efiPusion, is especially usrf il n chronic fomis of inflammation accompanied by thickening of part^ as m the joints and testes. ^ *

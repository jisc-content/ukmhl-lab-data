Ihis operation is seldom practised, disease being rarely limited to the metatarsal bones, but usually impheating the joints as well. Their disarticulation also from the tarsus is Tery troublesome, on account of the irregularity of the line of ai’ticulation; hence it is better to saw through the metatarsus just in front of the tareal articulations, than to attempt to disjoint the bones. A combination of these two iDrocedm-es may sometimes be advantageously adopted. In several of those severe crashes of the anterior part of the foot, that are not imfrequently the result of tram or railway injury, and in whiclr the bones and soft parts are- iiTegidarly crashed and torn, I have made a veiy excellent- stump by disarticulating the- first and the fifth metatamal bones, and sawing across the three middle ones almost an inch aaiterior to their articula- tions with the tarsus, or by simply dissecting back the sole of the foot, clearing the bones, and sawing them across at a convenient line.

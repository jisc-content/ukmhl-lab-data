«• 9i8 diseases of LYMPHATICS AND GLANDS. (lamp localities to those various conditions, indeed, that necessarily lead to deteriorated health and imperfect nutrition. The Diagnosis of these tumours, when in the lymphatic glands, from chi’o- nicaUy inflamed glands, is impossible in the early stages. It is only when their power of continuous and multiple growth becomes apparent that we call them lymphadenomata. The Treatment of lymphadenoma is in the highest degree unsatisfactory: Iodine, often applied locally in a routine manner, is absolutely useless, and no other external application appears in any way to promote the absorption of the mass. The constitutional treatment resolves itself into the employment of measures to combat the anmmia, and improve the nutrition of the system. With this view, iron, cod-liver oil, and continuous residence in bracing health- resorts, are serviceable. The question of the removal of the mass by operation must be discussed. If the tumour be large and single, or composed of an agglomeration of multiple masses, and so situated that it can be taken out with safety, its removal is proper, and should be practised. I have several times removed large lympha- denomata from the axilla and upper part of the neck with great advantage. Even when the disease is multiple, single large masses that are sources of special trouble should be dissected out. In one such case atumom’, which was as large as a fist, was removed, in University College Hospital, from the axilla. The patient, a delicate woman, had a group of similar growths in the neck, which had remained stationary for twenty years. Elephantiasis op the Legs and Sceotum.—Elephantiasis Ai-abum, or.

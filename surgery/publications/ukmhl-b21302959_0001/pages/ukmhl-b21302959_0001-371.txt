In three or foiu* cases of this accident which I have seen, somewhat troublesome stiffness of the parts has long been left. ' ^ In Kupture of the Muscles or Tendons of the Arms or Shoulder support in a sling is all the special treatment needed._ men the mi^cles about the shoulder are the seat of injury, rapid atrophy is apt to ensue, pro- bably owing to the implication of the circumflex and suprascapular nerves, and consequent interference with the nutrition of the part. Fig. 1B6 is a good illustration of the remote effects of such a strain of the capsular muscles of the shoulder-joint.

ADDENDA TO VOLUME I. Page 8. 1.—IMPURITIES IN HOSPITAL AIR. De Chaumout has analyzed the air of two of the London hospitals. Besides gaseous impurities in the form of free and albuminoid ammonia, organic oxygen, carbonic acid, nitric and nitrous acids, a quantity of solid matters suspended in the inspired air, on microscopical examination (5G2 d), these suspended particles were found to consist of a quantity of skin epider- mis, of nucleated epithelium from the mouth, pus-cells, and minute bodies (Sphicrobacteria), in active motion, besides a quantity of fibres of clothing. The dust from the ward showed, under a power of 300 diameters, fibres of clothing, dyed and midyed, wood and vegetable tissue, soot and charred wood, epithehmn, starch, a great deal of granular matter and spores of some kind; in fact, it was almost wholly organic. On the walls of one of the hospitals of Paris, Broca found pus-cells; and Nepveu discovered, in a similar locahty, at another, micrococci in immense numbers, microbacteria, epithelium, pus-ceUs, and red corpuscles. These facts, which might be greatly extended, prove that hospital air is, under ordinary circumstances, loaded with, and the Avails covered by, organic matters, often in a state of activity. These are germs of those diseases Avhich are the scourges of hospitals—the prevalence of Avhich is alike the evidence and the measure of their insalubrity, Avhich ai'e preventable by improA cd hygienic arrangements, and which, doubtless, Avill be prevented when once it is recognised that they arc not necessary and unavoidable cauIs. Page 9. 2.—VENTILATION IN HOSPITALS. Ihe effective height of a Avard to reckon for purposes of ventilation does not exceed 1:2 ft. Each surgical bed should have at least from 120 to 150 square feet of floor-space ; and the air of a surgical ward should be chanf^ed about three times in the hour, giving each patient about 5000 cubic feet° of air per hour.

SPEC I A L AMPUTA TIONS. 88 done just below the calf, at the junction of the lower and middle thirds of the limb ; nearer the ankle than this, it is not easy to get a good coA'cring for the bones. Ihe number of arteries divided will dejDcnd upon the situation of the amputation. Holden lays do'wn as a general rule in amputations one inch below the head of the fibula, one main artery only—the popliteal—is divided. At two inches two arteries, the anterior and posterior tibial, are cut. At three inches three arteries, the peroneal, in addition to the two tibials beins? divided. riap Amputation of the Leg may be performed in the following way. Eig. 55.—Amputation of tlie Eiglit Leg. Transfixion of the Posterior Flap. The toiu’uiquet hamng been applied to the artery in the pojiliteal space, the assistant, whose duty it is to retract the flap, takes his stand in this, as in all amputations of the lower extremities, ojjposite to the Smgeon. In the left limb, the point of the knife is entered at the j)osterior edge of the tibia, carried forwards for a distance of one inch and a half to two inches, then across the anterior part of the leg to the posterior border of the fibula, up which the incision is made to extend to a coiTesponding distance. In the right leg the same incision commences on the fibular side of the limb, and terminates on the tibial. The flap thus formed, which should be broad and well rofuided, is next dissected up by a few touches of the point of the knife, and transfixion of the limb is made by passing the blade across behind the bones, from one angle of the incision to the other (Fig. fjo). 1’he iwsterior flap is tlien formed by cutting obliquely downwards and backwards, and should be about three inches long. The bones are next cleared by a double sweep of the knife, and the

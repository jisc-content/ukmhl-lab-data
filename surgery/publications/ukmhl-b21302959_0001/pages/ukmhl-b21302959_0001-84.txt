After amputation for injury, also, there is a greater liability to the occun’ence of gangrene of the stumj), and pyeemia and its secondary effects, than in the case of the removal of a limb for disease ; in which the principal causes of death usually appear to be exhaustion, and the supervention of disease of the limgs. In amputation in cases of disease, it AviU be found that those patients do best in whom the disease is most chronic. This is especially observable in cases of disease of bones and of the joints. 4. The Nature of the Disease for Avhich the amputation is performed influences its mortality. Thus amputations for malignant disease are more fatal than those for caries of bone or diseased joints. In cases of diseased joint, there is a greater tendency to recover Avhen the afiection is of a simple than AA'hen it is of a tuberculous natime. Birkett has pointed out that disease of internal organs, often of the same natm-e as that for which the operation is performed, is foiuid after death in a large j)roportion of j)atients AA'he die after amputation. When suppiu'ative disorganisation of a joint is very acute, amjAutation, more particularly if the affected articulation be ot large size, as the knee, is attended by A’ery mifaA'omable results. The tendency to pycBmia is A'ery strong in such cases, the blood being loaded Avith effete materials, the products of the inflammatory action, AA’hich are specially apt to

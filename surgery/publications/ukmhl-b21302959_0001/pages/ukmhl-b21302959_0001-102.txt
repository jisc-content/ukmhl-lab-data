SPECIAL AMPUTA TIONS. 74 occuiToncG of hfomorrhage (Fig. 35). Tlic Surgeon should not cut the flap across until the assistant tells him that he holds the vessel finnly, and then he nnist be cautions not to injiu’e his assistant’s fingers. The artery will he found to be cut long in the middle of the inner flap, and a few smaller branches may be required to be tied at its inner angle, and in the deltoid. The stump after it is healed will present the appearance shown in Fig. 30. Am^ndation at Shoulder hi/ Oval Blethod.—In cases in which, from the state of the bone, the mam'pulations necessary for amputation by transfixion arc im- possible, the method originally invented by Lan-ey, or some modification of it, must be adopted. Larrey commenced his operation by a vertical incision doum to the bone, about two inches in length, commencing immediately below the acromion j^rocess. From the end of this he made a cmwed incision on each side, reaching to the coiTesponding fold of the axilla. The two flaps thus Fig. 34.—Amputation at the Shoulder-joint. Opening the Capsule, and making Inner Flap. foiTued were dissected u]d, and the head of the bone disarticulated. The knife was then passed internally to the head of the bone, and carried downwards, while an assistant followed it Avith his hands to compress the axillary artery. The operation was completed by dividing the tissues in the axilla, between the ends of the ttvo cimved incisions preA'iously made to its bordem. The most important modification of this method is that of Spence, vhich is specially adapted for gun-shot u’ounds of the upper end ot the hmnerus. It consists in canying the A'ertical incision fimther fonvards, and commencing it just extenially to and below the tip of the coracoid process, as in excision ot

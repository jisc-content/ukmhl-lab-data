The more thickly the bone is covered by soft parts, the more likely will an operation be to snccccd. Hence the hmnerns and femur are more lavourable for operation than the tibia. On reviewing the various methods that have been recommended for the re-establishment of union between the separated fragments, it would appear that the excitation of proper inflammatory action by the introduction of the seton, or by driving in ivory pegs, promises the most satisfactory result. It is ])y no means necessary, or even advisable, to remove the fibrous band that iuten-enes between the fragments in cases of false joint; for, if the proper amount of inflannnatoiy action be set up, this either undergoes osseous trans- formation, or a sufficient quantity of callus is throuui out around it to con- solidate the fracture. It is very important that the pegs should be removed from the bone, for, if they be allowed to remain after the bone has united, tedious supjruration and necrosis of the bone may result. If union should fail to be accomphshed, and the false joint were situated in the femiu' or the bones of the leg, the limb might be so useless and cumbersome to the patient, that amputation might be required as a last resource.

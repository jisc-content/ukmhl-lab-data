320 ARTERIO-VENOUS WOUNDS. of arterial blood on relaxing the pressiu’e on the upper part of the artery ; a ligature must then bo passed above and below the wound, and the cavity lightly dressed -with lint. Yanzetti has recorded a case of varicose aneurism of the brachial artery cured in six hours by digital compression, applied simultaneously to the artery aboA'e the tumom’, and to the orifice leading from the sac into the vein. Franzolini cined a case in the same way, after sixty days’ compression, at iiTO- gidar intervals. In Fischer’s tables are twelve cases of varicose aneurism, nine of which were cnred by digital compression. In at least four of these cnres it was applied as above described. It seems therefore that digital pressure is a hopefril mode of treating such cases.

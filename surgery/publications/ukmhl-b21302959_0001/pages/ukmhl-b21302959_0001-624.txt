596 INJURIES OF THE SEINE. the first lumbar vertebra, or, as in an instance recorded by Sir C. Bell, fracture of its body. I am not acquainted with any case in which dislocation without fracture of the Lumlar spine has been observed. The Symptoms presented by dislocations of the spine are, like those of fr’actiu’e, dependent on the degree and seat of the injury inflicted on the spinal cord. And death will ensue at varying periods, according to whether the dislocation be above or below the origin of the phrenic nerves, in accordance Avith those rules that have been laid down at p. 587. The Biagnosis between a dislocation and a fracture of the cervical spine is not easily made. But there is one symptom which, according as it is present or not, may throw much hght on this point. It is the occiuTence of pain, amormting to hyperresthesia, along the line of junction between the paralysed and unparalysed parts. In fr’actm’e this wiU commonly be found to be present (p. 590). In dislocation, Avhere the nerves are not irritated or lacerated in their exit through the spinal column, it is absent. The Treatment of dislocation of the spine, except in the case of the transverse processes, resembles in all important respects that of Fractm’e of the vertebral column.

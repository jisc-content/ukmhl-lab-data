This same process is performed upon the opposite side, the flaps are dissected down by a few touches of the knife, the extensor tendon is divided, the joint opened, and disarticulation performed. The oval method, which I think is the best, as it does not wound the palm, consists in entering the bistoury at the same point as in the last case, carrying it as far as the web, di’aAving it across the palmar aspect of the finger, and then obliquely backwai’ds to join the starting point of the incision. By a fcAv touches of the point of the knife the oval flap is turned back, and the ai-ticulatiou opened. Fig. 23.—Amputation of Left Tliumb and Metacaipal Bone. As a general rule, it is better to remove the head of the metacarpal bone, together mth the finger ; as othervdse a wide gap aaoU be left in the situation of the finger that has been amputated, and much deformity of the hand Avill result. This may be done by cutting the metacarpal bone across beyond its head with bone-forceps in a transA’erse direction, if it be either the middle or the ring finger that is removed (Fig. 18). If it be the index or the little fingei, the bone should be cut obliquely irom without inwards, so as to shape it to the tapering form of the hand (Fig. 19). This may be done either with the bone- forceps or Avith a siunll saAV. The saw has the advantage ot making a smoother section and of leaving no splinters. If it be cut directly across, an ugly and incouA'cnient square protuberance, liable to constant injury, A\dll be left. II hen, hoAvever, the patient’s employment is one in Avhich great strength and bieadth of hand are required, and where appearauce is ot little consequence, the head of the bone may advantageously remain.

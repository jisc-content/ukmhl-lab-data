7o8 ERYSIPELAS. by a comatose condition rapidly terminating in death ; the constitutional symptoms are those of low irritative fever. On examination after death, the ^ arachnoid and pia mater are found gi'eatly injected wth blood, forming a close red net-work of vessels over the surface of the brain ; the substance of which is usually somewhat injected, the ventricles being distended with a reddish- coloured serum. If examined at a later period in the disease than this, the inflamed arachnoid is found to be covered with a layer of opaque puriform lymph, of a greenish-yellow coloiuâ€™ and slimy consistence. Erysipelatous or Diffuse Peritonitis is not unfrequently met with in aged and cachectic subjects after the operation for hernia, or as a consequence of various diseases and injm-ies of the pelvic or abdominal organs. The symptoms are often of a latent character, the disease being chiefly indicated by obscure pain diffused over the abdomen with tenderness on pressure, an anxious depressed countenance, and a small and rather hard pulse. There may be heat of skin ; but it is a peculiar feature of this form of the disease that the patient may die without any elevation of the temperature of the body. On examination after death, the subperitoneal areolar tissue is found injected, the peritoneum opaque in parts, covered Avith fihny patches of greyish lymph, and usually containing a largish quantity of opaque dirty-looking tiubid fluid, mixed with shreds and floccuh of lymph. This, though closely resembhng pus in appearance, is serum with lymph intermixed, and is pecu- liarly acid, acrid, and irritating. It is this form of peritonitis that is especially dangerous to dissectors ; inoculation of the fingers with any of this fluid being often productive of the most serious and even fatal con- sequences. Erysipelatous Inflammation of the Lining Membranes of the Vascular System Avill be discussed when we come to consider diseases of these parts.

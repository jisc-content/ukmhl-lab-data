36 AirPUTATIONS. and Velpeau. I belie\-e that by either the eircnlar or the flap method an equally good stinnp may nlthnately be formed; but that much will depend upon the speeial dexterity whieh the Surgeon may have acquired by the habitual performance of one or other of these operations. Educated in the doctrines of Liston, who invariably amputated by the flap method, and who certainly did this ndth wonderful rapidity and jDrecision, I have been in the habit of performing this operation in preference to the circular, over which it certainly possesses the special advantages of greater celerity in perfomiance, more perfect coaptation and smoothness of the opposite sides of the wound, and a greater tendency to union of the stump by the first intention. But, though giving the preference as a general rule to the flap amputation, I would not by any means wish it to be understood that I lu’ge its adoption in all cases, or would ^vish to exclude entirely other methods of operating. In iujui'ies, especially, no one method can always be adopted, the Surgeon often being obliged to fashion his stump as best he may in accordance nfith the conditions to which the limb has been reduced by the injury inflicted on it. Many other points have to be considered, such as the best covering for the bones, the best pad for an artificial limb, and the best drainage for the stump during the healing process. But it is interesting to observe how the method of amputating has been materially modified in consequence of the general employment of Anaesthetics. In the pre-autesthetic days, the only means of saving pain was by rapidity of operating. Hence rapidity became an important element in the performance of so severe an operation as an amputation ; and this was secured by the flap method, the process of transfixion and of^ rapid cutting outwards bemg much less painftil than that of a slow cutting iiiwai'ds.

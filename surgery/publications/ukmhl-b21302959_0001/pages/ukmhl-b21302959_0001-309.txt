Torsion of Cut Arteries for the arrest of haamoirhagc is mentioned by Galen but the practice seems to have been forgotten until about 1828. It was rerived in France by Amussat, Velpeau, and Thierry; and in Geimany by Fricke, who experimented upon and practised this method of treating divided arteries, vuth much ingenuity aud perseverance. But, notwithstandmg the efforts made to force it on the attention of Surgeons, it was gradually abandoned, even by its strongest advocates. Torsion has never found much favour amongst Sm’geons in this country, and has, perhaps, been too much neglected. Of late years it has, however, again been revived, chiefly in Fig. 111.—Torsion of Bracliial Artery connection irith and by the advocates of the “ Antisejitic Treatment,” and by those who have been anxious to do away with the use of the ligatm’e, as being injurious in many ways, and more especially in regard to the direct union of woimds, particularly in plastic and other similar operations where t e presence of a ligature is very liable to occasion in-itation and suppuration. oision may be practised in various ways. Thus, Amussat recommends at the artery be draivn out for about half an inch by one pair of forceps ; seized at its attached end with another forceps, and that off ^^30ut a dozen tunis.

FRACTURE OF CORONOID PROCESS.. 417 from the same operation for disease of the articulation, which'Avill be described in Chapter XLIX. Fractures of the Fore-arm.â€”1. The only fracture of the bones ot tne fore-arm that commonly occurs in the vicinity of the elbow-joint, is that of the Olecranon; this almost invariably happens from falls upon the elbow, and hence is usually accompanied by very considerable bruising and swelhng of the parts. It may possibly, though very rarely, occur from musculai- action. The displacement is usually considerable, the detached fr-agment being drawn upwards by the triceps muscle. OccasionaUy, however, when the hgamentous expansion of the tendon of this muscle is not torn through, there is but little separation of the fr-agments. In the majority of cases, as the injury takes place fr-om direct violence, there is much swelling about the joint; and not unfr-equently the fracture is comminuted or compound. The Treatment is best conducted by moderately straightening the ann, and maintaining it in that position by means of a weU-padded light wooden sphnt laid along its fore part. But, although the arm should be kept nearly straight, it should not be quite extended. The best and most easy position in which to put it up is that into which the arm natimally falls when extended ; in this there will be seen to be slight flexion at the elbow (Fig. 165). If the fore-arm be too rigidly extended on the arm, it may be carried backwards beyond the straight hne, owing to the loss of the resistance of the olecranon against the fossa at the back of the humerus. In Compound Fracture of the Olecranon, when an attempt is made to save the joint, and where there is the possibility of ankylosis, the semi- flexed would be preferable to the straight position. In such cases, the antiseptic method should be used. If this fail, excision of the joint may be required. Fracture of the Coronoid Process of the Ulna has been supposed by many Surgeons to be a common complication, and, indeed, a cause of disloca- tion of the ulna backwards. There is every reason, however, to believe that t is is an error, and that, in point of fact, it is one of the rarest accidents in smgeiy at least, we must come to this conclusion, if we are to judge by the small number of recorded cases or of preserved specimens of this injiuy. amilton states that there are but eight cases on record in which the symptoms e to a behef that this accident had occiUTcd ; that in none of these cases Mere the symptoms imoquivocal, but in all open to doubt; and that in not one case did chssection afford an opportunity of positively demonstrating this acturc.^ There are but foirr preparations in existence, according to Hamilton, E T3

S57 ]'21]<Jj[TMENT of constitutional SIPIIILIS. of much and close observation on this point, that there is a general coiTCspon- clence betn-een the kind of ulcer and the manifestations of constitutional syphilis tliat may follow it; both, in fact, being chiefly dependent upon the state of tlie patient’s health. The same condition of system, for instance, that wli occasion a local chancre to assume the phagedmnic or sloughing form, will occasion rupia or ecthyma, with necrosis or caries of the bones, as the consti- tutional manifestations of syiihilis ; whereas that which occasions the indurated chancre will ecpially modify the secondary disease, so that it assumes a squamous form, accompanied perhaps by iritis and periosteal disease ; and the soft or excoriated chmicre will generally be followed by papular or roseolar eruptions, Avith mucous tubercles on the tongue or throat. That these sequences are of very frequent occmTence I cannot doubt, having frequently observed them ; and that they are not of constant occurrence is, I believe, owing to the character of the constitutional affection being modified, by the state of the patient’s health having undergone a change subsequently to the cure of the primaiy sore, or to the patient not having been infected with syiihilis when he con- tracted the local sore, and having thus not been rendered liable to constitutional infection. A patient having indurated chancre, will usually get psoriasis as the secondary cutaneous disease ; but if he fall into a cachectic state of health between the healing of the chancre and the supervention of the constitutional affection, rupia wiU manifest itself. Treatmek^t.—In the treatment of constitutional sjqdiilis, oim object is not so much to relieve or to remove any local morbid condition, as to eradicate a poison from the system ; and, indeed, the vmrious local manifestations, more especially those that appear upon the cutaneous and mucous surfaces, may possibly be efforts of uatme for the elimination of the virus from the system thi-ough the mediiun of the great excretory and emunctory organs ; and it is often apparently by aiding this natinal action by the administration of those remedies that act upon these tissues, that the poison is most effectually eradicated. Dm-ing the continuance of the pyrexia which often ushers in the secondary symptoms, little can be done in the way of specific means for the removal of the disease from the system ; rest and mild antiphlogistic treatment being aU that can be accomplished during this, the stage of invasion and of constitu- tional reaction. Great rehef is, however, afforded by a feAV doses of merenry given so as to affect the system. At a later period, when the cachexy Avhich is attendant on the disease has declared itself, attention to the hygienic and dietetic management of the patient is of the utmost importance ; a hght noiu’ishing diet, often accompanied by the moderate lAse of wine or beer, and in some of the lower forms of syphilis in broken constitutions, a general tonic plan of treatment, such as the administration of bark, quinine, or iron, and more especially of cod-liver oil, with the mineral acids and sarsaparilla, are required in combiiiation Avith the more specific means that Ave possess for the eradication of the disease fr’om the system. These hygienic and tonic remedies must be administered in accordance AA'ith general medical principles, and no special instructions need consequently be laid down for their use hero. The treatment of syphilis is conducted on one of these principles :—1, by the administration of mercury, Avith the vicAV of directly and specifically elimi-

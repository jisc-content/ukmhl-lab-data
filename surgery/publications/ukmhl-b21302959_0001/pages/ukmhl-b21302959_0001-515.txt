In these we have the preceding signs, though Fig. 214. -Dislocation of the RacUus forwards : Limit of Power of Bending the Ai-m.

The most characteristic symptom, however, is the patient’s inabihty to flex the forearm upon the arm. This he can never do to a greater extenthhan to bring the elbow to a right angle (Fig. 214). On being told to touch the tip of his shoulder with his fore-finger, he wiU find it impossible to do so. The dislocation of the radius Backwards is extremely rare ; it may always be recognised by the head of that bone being felt subcutaneously behind the external condyle ; the movements of the elbow, and of the radius especially, lieing at the same time veiy hmited and painful. Di.slocation of the radius Outwards is of more frequent occiurence than the last injury, the head of the bone being thi-own on the outer side of the external condyle, where it is felt under the skin, rolling as the hand is moved.' The natiu’al motions of the joint are of course greatly interfered with. The radius and ulna are sometimes displaced in Opposite Directions, the ulna being thrown lachwards, and the radius forwards. This injury, of which lhave seen two instances at the hospital, usually results fr-om heavy falls upon the hand, with a wreneh of the limb at the same time, as when a person is

657 PLASTIC OPERATIONS ON THE PERINjEUM. should be applied. "When the recto-vaginal septum has been implicated, the bowels should not be allowed to act for at least ten or twelve days, lest the freshly united surfaces be torn through. When the perina3um only has been the seat of laceration, they maj be allowed to act earlier. Diming the whole of the treatment, the patient’s strength must be supported by abundant nourish- ment, and scrupulous attention paid to the cleanliness of the parts, which should be frequently syringed vdth carbolised water and covered with finely carded dry wool. Plastic operations of this kind should not be performed unless the patient be in a good state of health, that there may be a good prospect of immediate union. The success of the case will at last mainly depend on the extent of laceration, or rather of loss of substance, in the recto-vaginal septum. If this be uninjured, or merely notched as it were, there will be but little difficulty experienced in effecting a cure. If, on the other hand, this wall be deeply lacerated, or, still worse, if a portion of it have sloughed away, the greatest difficulty may result in effecting union ; and in such untowai’d circumstances it may happen, that the perimeum unites, but that a fistulous opening is still left in the recto-vaginal wall, requiring a futime plastic operation for its closure {vide Chapter LXVII.).

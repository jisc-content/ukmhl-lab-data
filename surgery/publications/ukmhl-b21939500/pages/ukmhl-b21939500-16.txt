INAUGURAL ADDRESS. 14 materia medica; and I might also dilate, if I had not already occupied your time too long, on many individual improvements in the practice of medicine, in relation to particular diseases,—as to the cure and banishment of scorbutus from our fleets; to the introduction in later times of iodine in the treatment of goitre and other affections; to the great and important changes that have taken place in the detection and treatment of the oxaluric, of the phosphatic, and other diatheses indicated by the state of the urine ; to our increased know- ledge of the nature, diagnosis, and treatment of the various local diseases of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; to the increased certainty and success with which we can now adapt our curative treatment to the relief or removal of the numerous ailments complicated with, or originating in, typhus fever, scarlatina, albuminuria, rheumatism, gout, and other general diseases ; and to the vast addi- tions latterly made to our previous knowledge of the nature and unspeakable importance of various prophylactic, hygienic, and sanitary causes and measures. But let me content myself however with pointing more particularly to one or two special matters only, as illustrative of the fact that practical medicine, during the last fifty or sixty years, has made greater strides than practical surgery, or indeed than any other branch of practical knowledge whatever. As an illustration, look for a moment at the whole class of infantile diseases. In the latter years of the last century, Dr William Hunter and the other leading English authorities in those days on such affections, believed and taught all infan- tile diseases to be the results either of fever, and to be treated with anti-febrile means ; or the results of weakness, and to be treated with tonics and stimulants. The pathological investigations, however, of the last half century, have proved that the different organs of the child are liable to nearly as numerous and diversified morbid actions as the same organs are in after life; that the same classes or types of diseased action occur in the system of the child as occur in the system of the adult ;—that some maladies, particularly of an inflammatory character, as pneumonia, peritonitis, encephalitis, etc., which were supposed to be very rare in infancy, are now known, on the contrary, to be exceedingly common during that fragile period of life ;—and that the medical management of infantile maladies must be varied as in the adult, according to the individual disease present, and cannot be conducted on the belief that all affections in infancy are amenable to one or two modes of general treatment. The hygiene and management of infancy have in an equal degree improved. And the whole changes in these respects have produced great changes in the mortality of the earlier years of life. Formerly, towards the middle of the last century, fifty or sixty out of every hundred children born in London, died before they had reached their fifth year; but the mortality has gradually and steadily diminished, so that now not above thirty or thirty-five in every hundred die at that early period. At the present time there are above 600,000 children born annually in Great Britain. According to the above scale of mortality, above 300,000 of these would have perished formerly before they were five years old, now only about 200,000 die during the first five years of life ; thus showing a saving of human life in this item alone, to the extent of at least 100,000 human beings a-year.

ARITHMETIC MEANS. 231 The successive Means of series e are— iff) i.88. 1.81.

Whilst the Means in series (A) are moderately uniform, those in series (g) exhibit in its second half greater fluctuations than hi its first; and we should, therefore, assume that series (e) had been too much influenced by disturbances, and was unfitted for purposes of comparison, even if the following considerations did not otherwise compel us to do so. This series (e) is divisible into two distinct parts : the first eight days give high values, whose successive Means exhibit but little fluctuation; whilst the last four days descend sud- denly to very low ones. Moreover, a comparison of this series of observations with others teaches us that it is on the low numbers that the disturbmg agency has operated; the probability of which assumption is increased when we consider that the days during which the observations of series (f) were carried on immediately followed those of series (e), and, consequently, that the quantity of potash must have risen quite suddenly from i.oo to 3.18, 3.25, &c. In addition, the smaller numbers regularly increase from the first mem- ber of the group, .30. Let us, therefore, assume that the first eight days are alone of any comparative value; to which there will be the less objection as, in doing so, we reject the lowest, and those numbers which are most favorable for a positive result. We will now, as a preliminary, estimate the amount of uncertainty from the Successive Means, in order to see whether it will be worth our while to take its more accurate gauge by means of the mean fluctuation. The Mean of the first eight numbers of series (g) is 1.97; the greatest divergence from the Successive Mean, .21; the Mean of series (A) is 2.86, and the greatest divergence .39; conse- quently, the difference of the mean values (2.86 — 1.97 = .89), is greater than the sum (.6) of the greatest divergences, which gives us a prospect of a positive result. I11 reality, the mean fluctuation in the first eight numbers of series (e) is .42, and that of series (f) .64, so that the mean difference (2.89 — 1.90=1.99) 15

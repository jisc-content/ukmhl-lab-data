COLD IN SURGERY. 291 Fig. 2. shaped kinds made in Germany and France, for in this case the nurse who has to fill it with ice will probably injure it in endea- vouring to force a too large piece through the narrow opening. Another important point is the mode of closing. Formerly we used to draw the orifice of the bag together with a piece of tape, in the way that leather purses are closed. But to shut up the bag well by these means it is necessary to draw the tape very tight, and as this has to be repeated every time the bag is filled, it soon gets damaged. But by using a large cork or, better, a wooden roller, the bag may be hermetically closed with much less injury to it. The opposite sides of the orifice should be placed smoothly in apposition, and then tied round the roller (fig. 2) with a bit of tape suf- ficiently broad (about half an inch) to prevent it from cutting into the substance of the bag. The mode of fastening is represented in fig. 3. The roller has in its centre a ring, through which a bit of string may be passed, with the object of suspending the bag over the part of the body to which the ice is to be applied in cases where it is desirable to prevent pressure. The bag, thus closed, may be hung up with its orifice downwards for days together, without allowing of the escape of a single drop of water. If the inflamed part can bear, with- out inconvenience, a moderate amount of pressure, and if it is not necessary that the patient should keep his bed, the ice-bag may be wrapped up in a cloth and tied round the injured part, and thus made to fit nicely. It is in all cases advisable to place a bit Fig 3.

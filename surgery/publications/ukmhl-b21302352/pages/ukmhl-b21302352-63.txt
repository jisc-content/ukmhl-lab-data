CHAPTER Y. PATHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. I shall commence by reproducing in this place seven cases already published elsewhere (‘Bib./ No. 9); because, independently of the observation communicated by Dr. Semeleder (‘ Bib./ No. 4), and of two cases described by Dr. Stoerk (‘Bib./ No. 7), they form the first series of observations which have well established the practical advantages of the method of Liston and Garcia. I would recall, besides, the observations subsequently published by Dr. Turck (‘Bib./ Nos. 12 and 13), and by Dr. Gerhardt (‘Bib./ No. 15). Case 1. Complete obstruction of the larynx by two tumours springing from the mucous membrane beneath the free border of the vocal cords, the result of scrofulous infiltration, and necessitating laryngotomy. In the month of December, 1858, I was requested by Professor Balassa to examine a patient, of whom he had published the surgical history in the ‘ Gazette Hebdomadaire * of Hungary.1 Dr. Porges kindly furnished me with the following notes of the patient: R. Z— is a young girl, eighteen years of age, of lymphatic temperament, middling size, and robust constitution; she was born of scrofulous parents, and inherits, with her brother, aged fourteen years, the same sad complaint; whilst two sisters, much elder, are exempt from it. Enjoying perfect health up to the age of seven years, she was then seized with bronchitis, which persisted during a whole year. Erom that time, there occasionally appeared, in different- parts of the body, glandular enlargements, which, however, disappeared in the course of a short time. Eive years back, the mesenteric glands suddenly became enlarged, and this enlargement produced considerable swelling of the lower part of the belly. 1 f Orvosi Retilap/ No. 42, 1858.

229 ARITHMETIC MEANS. determine the degree of uncertainty of the Mean, it would be neces- sary to estimate exactly the entire mean fluctuation, unless the Successive Means themselves indicated that the sarsaparilla had not exercised any sensible influence on the amount of urine; for the difference of the ultimate Means, 1549 — 1499 = 50, is much less than the fluctuations of the successive Means amongst themselves. We will now determine the mean fluctuations for the sake of the opportunity of exhibiting to those readers who are unskilled in numerical proceedings an example of the way in which this is done. Tor tliis purpose we first determine the individual fluctuations. In the first series, whose Mean is 1499, these are— 1499 — 1467 = 4-32 J499 — W44 = — 245 1499 — 1665 = — 166 1499 — 1220 = 4- 279 (c) 1499 — 1161 = 4-338 *499 — *369 = + I3° 1499 — 1675 = —176 1499 2129 = 63O 1499 — 887 = 4- 612 1499 — 1643 = ~I44 1499 _ 934 = 4- 565 r499 — 2093 = — 594 In the second series, whose Mean is 1549, the fluctuations are— J549 — 1263 = + 286 x549 — T7 4° = “ 191 (d) 1549 — 1538 = 4- 11 1549 — 152'6 =4-23 1549 — J387 = + 162 1549 — 1422 = 4- 127 1549~ I754 = — 205 1549 — 1320 = 4- 229 1549 — 1809 — — 260 1549 — ^39 = — 59° l549 — 1574 = “ 25 1549 — H14 = + 435

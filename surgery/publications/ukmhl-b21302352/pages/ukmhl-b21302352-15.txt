PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION. The following pages are, as near as possible, a literal translation, by Dr. G. D. Gibb, of the Trench edition1 of my German brochure2 translated by Dr. L. Mandl, of Paris. I have enlarged the present work by the addition of an Appendix on Rhinoscopy, together with some notes and sketches. I leave the preface unaltered, as it appeared in the original German, because it brings before the mind of the reader the actual desires which I entertained, and which were subsequently followed out with success.

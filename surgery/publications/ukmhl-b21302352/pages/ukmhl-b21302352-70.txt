LARYNGOSCOPE. 52 dition of tlie normal flowing of tears; in fact, we have never observed the slightest inconvenience of that function in our patient. Nevertheless, we do not wish to deny that, under certain circum- stances, the difference of pressure exerted by the respiratory move- ments can have any influence whatever upon the flow of tears. Case 2.â€”Polypus attached to the right vocal cord, giving rise to constant hoarseness, supposed to he nervous ('Bib./ No. 8). On January 2d, 1859, Dr. Hirschler brought to me a gentleman, forty years of age, belonging to the upper ranks of society, who had been attended for many years for a nervous hoarseness. This affec- tion suddenly came on after a considerable effort (of the voice), and never wdiolly disappeared, but had always momentarily grown worse under the influence of violent emotion. The laryngoscopic examination, which the patient sustained without the least difficulty, afforded me a surprising result; it showed, in fact, that the constant hoarseness was not of a nervous character, but that it was due to an acci- Fig. 15. dental roimd and uneven production, of a dark colour, and of which its base, somewhat large, occupied a spot situated about the middle of the right vocal cord. I recognised the soft consistence of this tumour by the agitation which it under- went during the vibrations of the vocal 1 iff. 15. Polypus attached to the corc[ and by its flexibility when partially of a supposed nervous aphonia, squeezed by the glottis. The alteration of the voice during emotion led us to suppose that changes in the size and consistence of this tumour might result from disorders in the circulation. Figure 15 repre- sents a sketch taken immediately after the examination. Dr. Semeleder, of Vienna, to whom I sent this patient, has since confirmed not only, in all their details, the existence of this polypus, but also, later, as it appears, the growth of the tumour.

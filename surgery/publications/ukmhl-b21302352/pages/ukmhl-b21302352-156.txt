ATROPHY OP THE 136 was very much atrophied, and its walls were very thin; the convolu- tions were here very small or had nearly disappeared, perhaps in con- sequence of the constant pressure of the fluid collected in the horn; the left crus cerebri was thinner, and the left corpus mammillare much smaller, than the right; the left half of the pons varolii and the left corpus pyramidale presented a much smaller circumference than on the right side ;n the difference between the corpora olivaria was less. In the cerebellum, on the contrary, the atrophy was on the oppo- site side, the right hemisphere (Fig. Ill, f) being in all its measure- ments much less than the left; consequently the so-called vermis or pyramis, posteriorly situated in the middle between the hemispheres of the cerebellum, was drawn obliquely to the right side (k).1 2 No remarkable difference was manifest in the nerves, except that the optic nerve of the left side appeared to be somewhat slighter than the right, while the olfactory was shorter, and somewhat, although but little, more attenuated. It is extremely remarkable that, while the medulla oblongata above the decussation is larger on the right side, the right corpus pyrami- dale agreeing with it in this respect, beneath the decussation, as appears from the transverse section of the spinal cord, the left or opposite side is thicker; so that below the decussation the atrophy of the left hemisphere has transferred itself to the right side of the spinal cord, as well as of the cerebellum; the atrophy of the right side of the cord was very evident at the level of from the fifth to the seventh cervical vertebra.3 In some measure corresponding to this I found the roots (but particularly the ganglia on a level with the brachial plexus), of the 1 See Fig. Ill, and the table given at the end. In this figure I have drawn the medulla oblongata shortened, in order the better to show the difference in circumference between the two sides; it is placed in precisely the natural direction which it occupies during life, as I saw clearly from a cast and moulding of this brain prepared by Heer Schubard, Demonstrator of Anatomy, which fitted exactly into the skull. All the drawings with which I am acquainted, representing the base of the brain, err in the precise direction of the medulla oblongata with respect to the brain. 2 See the particular measurement and difference in size of these several parts of the cerebellum in the table appended to this work. 3 In order to spare the skeleton, which, as we shall see, likewise offers so many important points of comparison, the spinal canal was not further opened.

ON THROMBOSIS OF THE CEREBRAL SINUSES. A case of formation of a thrombus in the superior longitudinal sinus, which came under observation amongst our out-patients in the course of the present year, together with some cases of a similar kind communicated by Dr. Gerhard, in the â€˜ Deutsche Klinik/ some time ago, led to the publication of the following paper.

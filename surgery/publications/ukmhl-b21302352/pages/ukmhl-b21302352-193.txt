LEFT HEMISPHERE Ob' THE BRAIN. 173 But this affords no explanation of the change of the orbit in blindness and atrophy of the eye, if there are no traces of irritation of the periosteum, nor does it account for the origin of the frontal sinuses. The bones are not, however, fixed and unchangeable parts ; in them, too, incessant metamorphosis of tissue and alteration of parts go on, which appear to place themselves differently according to the varied impressions they receive; but of these changes we are in many cases unable to give any satisfactory explanation. I have often observed that general thickening of the skull is of frequent occurrence, traces of previous chronic inflammation or irritation being at the same time present. Thus, for example, in the thickened skulls which are frequently found in the insane, the dura mater adheres so firmly to the inside of the cranium that it is very difficult to separate it. In old men, in whom Gall describes thickening of the skull as a usual occurrence,1 it does not by any means invariably occur. So far as my observations go, it is found only where chronic affections have existed, in con- sequence of which atrophy of the brain has at length set in, with more or less serous exudation and traces of chronic meningitis; that is, under the same circumstances as exist in unilateral atrophy. 1 Â£ Anat. et Phys. du Syst.

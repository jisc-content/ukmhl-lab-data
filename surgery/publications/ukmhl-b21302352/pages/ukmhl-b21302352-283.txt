249 ARITHMETIC MEANS. but those which belong to the succeeding ones. Thus, for example, the square of .637 is not .3058, but .4058. If we want to find the square of a number which is greater than 2.099, we shift the decimal stop as far as is necessary to make the number less than 2.099, take the square number contained in the contiguous column, and then shift its decimal stop twice the number of places that we did in the original number. Tor instance, suppose that we wish to find the square of 18.52; we shift the stop one place so as to convert it into 1.852, look for the square of that number, which the table gives as 3.4299, and then shift the stop in it twice as many places as we did in the first number, i. e. two places, which converts it into 342.99, or the square of 18.52. Or, if we want to find the square of 136, we write it 1.36 or 1.360. The square given in the table for this number is 1.8496. By moving the stop double the number of places that we did at first, we convert this into 18496, which is, consequently, the square of 136. With regard to square roots, the tables only give the roots of numbers from o to 4.4058. If, now, we wish to find the root of any number which is less than 4.4058, e.g., 1.7505, we look for the first two figures 1.7 in the o space, and the last three figures in the other columns of the same or following spaces. If we cannot exactly find the last three figures (505), we take those three numbers of the table which come nearest to them (in this case 503). We, therefore, take for the first three figures of the required root the figures of the first series which stand on its horizontal line (1.32), and as the fourth figure the one which is inscribed over the column (in this case 3), so that 1.323 are the first four numbers of the root of I-75Â°5- If, on the other hand, the number whose square root we wish to find is greater than 4.4058, we shift the decimal stop two, or four, or six (always an equal number of) places, until we get a number which is less than 4.4058; we then look in the table for its root, and shift the stop of the number found half as many places to the right as in the original number. Thus, if we wish to find y'238.5, we write it V2.385, or ^2.3850; we shall then find as the correspond- ing (or the nearest to the corresponding number, in this case 2.3839) number in the table the number 1.544, in which we shift the stop half as many places to the right as we moved it to the left before, which gives us 15.44 as ^238.5. Or, suppose we want to find ^38542, we write it ^3.8542^

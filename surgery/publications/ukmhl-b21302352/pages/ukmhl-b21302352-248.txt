THE IMPORTANCE OF 214 sequently, if we were ignorant of the extent of the period, but had reason to believe that the investigation had broken off after the con- clusion of the first one, the last Mean would be an approximately correct one, and we might assume as the limit of error the greatest fluctuation which the series of Successive Means exhibited in so many of its latter values as the period possessed conjecturally mem- bers. Thus, supposing that the above series broke off at the fourth 3, the Mean would be 5; and if we had reason to think that the period had not more than five members, we should compare the last five Successive Means, viz., the numbers 44, 3-^-, 34, 3^, 5; and since amongst them 541s the number which diverges most from 5, we might assume \ to be the limit of error. But a better course still would be to take as the probable Mean, not 5, but the Mean of the above five Means, or, in round numbers 5k, by which method the limit of error would be reduced to 5k—5r = -rr* Suppose that we assume now that a second periodically acting influence intervenes, that its time of action is three days, and that its members are 4, 8, 3, so that the series 4, 8, 3; 4, 8, 3, &c.— with the Successive Means 4, 6, 5; 44, 5; 4f, 54, 5; 4W, 5ttj is produced. The numbers which are obtained will be the sums of the two periodic series, viz., 5, 11, 14, 11, 9, 6, 15, 15, 4, 7, 19, 10, &c., and the Successive Means will be the sums of the two sets of Successive Means, viz., 1+4, 2 + 6, 5+5, 5i+4i. 4i+5b 4-s+5, 5t+4t> 5t+5t, 5 + 5> 4t+4t2u. &c.,i. e. 5, 8, 10, 104, 10, 94, io4, i of, 10, 9-^, whilst the true Mean is 5i + 5 = 10b It will be seen that so soon as we pass beyond the limits of the first period, indeed, even at the commencement of the second half of that period, a sensible approximation to the true Mean begins to be evident. If, now, the series broke off, suppose at the tenth num- ber, we should have as our ultimate Mean 9-^, and (again assuming that the period did not exceed five days) we should have as the limit of error iof — 9-^ == i-^o; or,—if we take, in order to reduce these limits, the Arithmetic Mean of the last five mean numbers as the probable Mean, in round numbers 10, with f as the limit of error. The reason for the diminution of the fluctuations in the effective mean series lies in the fact that they can never exceed the sums of the fluctuations which the corresponding Successive Means of the two original series exhibit. It will hence be evident that even in case of the concurrent action of two influences, each of a definite

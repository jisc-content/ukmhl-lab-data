TJJE IMPORTANCE OF 190 and consequently is intermediate to the extremes of the numbers . , . V92 + o2 + o2 V32 + 32 + q2 m question (since z — = v^2 = g, and — 3 3 = v/32 = 3). Moreover it must be remarked, as in the case of the Geometric Mean, that if the two extreme numbers are left un- altered, the result will be nearer to 9 or 3 in proportion to the greater or lesser amount of the third number.1 It must be noted here that it may be exactly and mathematically demonstrated, that the Quadratic always somewhat exceeds the Arithmetic Mean, and that to an amount proportionate to the in- equality of the given numbers. The first of these assertions is illustrated in the two examples given above, in which the Quadratic Means were 8.75, and 7.16, whilst the Arithmetic Means were only 71 and 6$. As an illustration of the second, viz. that the divergence increases with the inequality of the numbers, the following will serve : The series 3, 2, 9, 10, and 3, 5, 6, 10, give the same Arithmetic Mean, viz. 6. On the other hand, the first of them, which contains the more unequal numbers, gives the Quadratic Mean of 6.96, whilst that of the second is only 6.52. The more equal the numbers, the nearer does the Quadratic ap- proach to the Arithmetic Mean; and when they are quite equal, it exactly coincides with it. This character, however, is not peculiar to the Quadratic Mean; it will have been seen, by the two examples given above, that it is possessed also by the Geometric and Harmonic Means, and it occurs, as a necessary sequence of the general idea of a Mean, with all kinds of Means. The Mean of the numbers 9, 9, 9, &c., is 9, of whatever kind it may be. 1 Although reference will be made hereafter to this peculiarity of the Qua- dratic Mean, this may not be an unfit place to prove, for those readers who are acquainted with Algebra, the single case at least where the inequality lies in two numbers. If the numbers a and b occur in a series, their arithmetic mean is not affected by substituting for them a + c and b — c. Let us suppose, now, that a > b} then a + c and b — c are more unequal than a and b, and the Quadratic Mean will, in conformity with the rule, be greater in the second case than in the first, so soon as (a + c)2 + (b — c)2 > a2 + b2. But (a + c)J -f (b — (3) = «2 -f 2ac + c2 + b2 — 2be + c2 = «2 + b2 + 2C {a — b) + 2c2; consequently, since a > b, and also a — b, as well as 2c {a — b), is positive, in reality {a + c)2 + {b — c)'2 exceeds a? + b2 by the positive quantity 2c (a — b) + c2. In a similar manner may we prove the accuracy of the pro- position for the case where the series includes more than two unequal numbers.

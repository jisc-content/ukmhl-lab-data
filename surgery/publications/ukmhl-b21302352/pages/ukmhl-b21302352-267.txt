ARITHMETIC MEANS. 233 The normal series of observations was conducted for four consecu- tive days, shortly before the employment of the sugar, and for ten consecutive days after it, and gave the following numbers : 30.6. 31.2. 24.2. 24.3. 33.8. 22.6. 27.9. 17.7. 23.2. 22.9. 17.8. 18.5. 23.0. 25.0. The second number in the first series differs so widely from all the others that it is most convenient to exclude it. The remaining eight observations give 15.7 as their Mean, with the mean fluctuation of 2.03; whilst the Mean of the normal series is 24.5, and the mean fluctuation 4.76. The difference of the Means is, consequently, 8.8, and the sum of the mean fluctuations 6.79; from which a decided diminution of urea, under the influence of sugar, cannot be pre- dicated. Alcohol was taken during six days, and the numbers obtained were— 18.48. 20.02. 14*57. 22.54. 17.04. 22.37; whose Mean is 19.17, and the mean fluctuation 2.84. The corre- sponding normal series of observations, whose number was nine, and a portion of which was instituted during very distant periods of time (they extended hi separate groups from the 17th of November to the 6th of February; whilst the alcohol series occurred between the 17th and the 26th of February), gave the following numbers : 27.85. 26.92. 28.34. 35.24. 38.75. 31.17. 24.39. 25-° 4- 35-36; whose Arithmetic Mean is 30.34. Since the smallest number in the normal series exceeds the largest hi the alcohol one, the diminution by the use of this agent is obviously demonstrated. Let us examine hi the same manner the amount of earthy phos- phates contained in the urine. During the use of sugar, the num- bers obtained were, if we exclude, as above, the second number— .94. 1.00. .85. .89. 1.08. 1.08. .62. .75. In the normal series the earthy phosphates were determined during the first five days, and the numbers obtained were: 2.64. 2.60. .96. 1.58. 2.54. The first series gives the Mean .93, with the mean fluctuation .13; the second series gives the Mean 2.06, with the mean fluctuation .68. The mean difference is, therefore, 1.13, and the sum of the Mean fluctuations .83; consequently, as the first number consider-

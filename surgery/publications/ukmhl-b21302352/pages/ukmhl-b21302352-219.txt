Dr. Boecker has on several occasions submitted to me recent papers of a pharmacological nature, with the view of obtaining from me a confirmation of his opinion, that great want of caution is frequently exhibited in draw- ing inferences from observations; and he at length has requested me to assist him in stemming the stream of baseless and, to a great extent, erroneous doctrines which daily threaten to overwhelm medical science.

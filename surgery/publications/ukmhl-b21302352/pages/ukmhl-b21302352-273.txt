ARITHMETIC MEANS. 239 in which the largest amount of salt was ingested was 2324 cub. cent.1 per diem, at a temperature of 10.8° (56.3° hah.); and for the four series in which it was smaller only 2238 cub. cent., but at a tempe- rature of 15.6° (67.10 hah.). The difference of temperature is here obviously so great that, putting aside other reasons, any conclusion would be unjustifiable.” Kaupp would, therefore, have considered the mean numbers 2324 and 2238 as sufficiently remote from one another to admit the conclusion that an increase of the urine resulted from an increase of the dose of salt (although this difference, as appears above, is less than the small estimated measure of uncertainty of several of the other series), if the consideration of the temperature had not prevented him from doing so. Indeed, though he does not admit these numbers, he avails himself of them afterwards in order to correct them on the point of temperature. With the view of eliminating the influence of temperature, he collocates in each series the observations of those days whose mean temperatures ap- proximate to one another, and especially those in which the tempe- rature lies between 70 and 90, between 90 and n°, between n° and 130, and so on, to between 170 and 190. Thus, for example, we have, for the temperature of 70—90, in the first series, five days (viz., the first, second, ninth, tenth, and twelfth days), with a mean volume of urine of 2353; and in the second series, three days (viz., the third, seventh, and ninth days), with the mean volume of 2502. For the sake of explaining this point more clearly, I will cite the first three groups, arranged according to their temperature : Temperature. Dose of Salt. Mean Volume Number of Reaumur. of Urine.

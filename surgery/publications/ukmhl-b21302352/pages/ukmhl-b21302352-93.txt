APPENDIX ON RHINOSCOPY. In order to give a clearer idea of the method which I invented, and called “ Rhinoscopy” (from ptv and gkott&o), I think it advi- sable to add, in the form of an appendix to this little work on the Laryngoscope the following remarks and pathological observations. The wToodcut (Pig. 30) is meant to explain the mode of rhinoscopic investigation, already described in Chapter III, Section Y. The observer holds the large reflector, R, by a mouth-piece between his molar teeth, and looks through the hole in its centre. The luminous rays of the sun, or a good moderator lamp, coming from behind the person experimented on, are concentrated by means of the large reflector upon the little mirror, k, which is introduced with its reflecting surface turned upwards, and which throws the rays into the nasal cavity, so as to illuminate it. The image of the illuminated parts is reflected by the same little mirror into the eye of the observer. The velum and uvula are raised and drawn gently forwards, by means of a suitably bent hook, cr (see Pig. 11). I11 the drawing the left hand of the observer, which holds the hook, has been omitted. The observer's right hand, which supports itself on two fingers resting on the jaw, as represented in the engraving, introduces the small mirror, with its reflecting surface turned upwards, under the elevated velum, and then behind it. Rhinoscopy renders accessible to view—through the widely open mouth and fauces—the nasal* part of the pharynx and the nasal fossse from below and behind; it must, therefore, be remembered that the canal through which we look should neither be obliterated by the tongue nor the velum, but must remain widely open.

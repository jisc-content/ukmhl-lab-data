49 PATHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. vided with a plate of metal to fasten the straps on. We likewise see a very small mirror, the curved stem of which projects out of the canula. In front of the canula is placed the concave mirror, which concentrates the rays of the laryngoscope; the dotted line indicates the visual direction of the ob- server. The laryngoscope, some- times, interferes with the respiration, but it does not prevent the examination ; it was warmed previous to in- troduction, but as it con- sisted of a very thin metal plate, it became rapidly cooled, and I w'as obliged to warm it almost every in- stant. I conceived a new proceeding, which obviates this inconvenience, and pre- vents the tarnishing of the of condensed moisture : it con- sists in the application of a very fine layer of a solution of gum arabic, which retains the clearness of the image for a sufficiently long time. I could also examine very clearly and very conveniently, from below upwards, that portion of the larynx which was closed. I discovered that the round opening of the larynx was obstructed by two tumours of the mucous membrane situated beneath the free border of the vocal cords, and that they took their origin from the lateral and posterior parts. I have given a sketch of this in Figure 14, b ; we perceive a longitudinal furrow, not very deep, at the point of contact of the two tumours. The left side of the image corresponds to the right side of the larynx, and vice versa, as in all the laryngo- scopic figures; but the superior border of the image corresponds to the posterior periphery of the opening of the larynx, the inferior border to the anterior periphery, or rather to the internal 4 ygj HI speculum by the deposit Fig. 14.

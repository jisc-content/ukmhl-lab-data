THE IMPORTANCE OF 224 obtained, just to show that their inequality dissipates every idea of comparison between them. The numbers are— Wangeroge: 24.8. 30. 28.5. 26.8. Mean, 37.5. Oldenburg: 23.7. 28.6. 24.4. 21. Mean, 24.4. It will be seen that two numbers in the upper series (viz. 24.8 and 28.3) so nearly agree with two numbers of the lower 6ne (viz. 24.4 and 28.6), that the whole of the author's conclusion (viz. that the sea air produces an increase) only rests upon two observa- tions. Let us now examine the numbers of the bathing period. The seven days in July gave: 27.93, 27.79, 28*39; 28.17, 29.61, 28.97, 27.51. The successive Means of which are 27.86, 28.04, 28.07, 28.38, 28.48, 28.34. Moreover, the eight days in August gave: 26.83, 35.99, 28.33, 28.65, 28.99, 33.13, 28.29, 27.81. Whose successive Means are: 26.41, 27.02, 37.45, 37.76, 38.49, 38.46, 38.38. In consequence of the too great incompleteness of the July series of researches at Oldenburg, no other numbers remain but the present ones with which to compare the undoubtedly very far separated February series at Oldenburg, which consists of the follow- ing numbers: 22*33; 24.09; 35.26, 28.51, 27-99; 25-76; 26.80, 39.37, 24.90, 25.04; 23-35; 20.33, 32.70, 23-°3; and gives the \ following Means: 33.21, 23.89, 25-°5; 35.64, 35.66, c? 00 e* 36.35, 26.10, 26.00, 25-75; 25-3°; 25.10, 24-95* The predominance of high numbers in the two Wangeroge series appears at first sight to bespeak a favorable result for the increase of urea; yet this is made very doubtful by the great fluctuations in the comparative series at Oldenburg. And since these fluctuations are very evident even in the Successive Means, these latter are quite insufficient for any definite conclusion, and we are compelled to fall back on the mean fluctuations. Now the mean fluctuation of the first of the three series is .68; of the second, 1.69; of the third, 2.46. The difference of the Arithmetic Means of the first and third series is, consequently, 28.34 — 24.95 = 3*39, an^ ^le sum ^ie mean fluctuations .68 + 2.46 = 3.14 ; for the second and third series, on the other hand, the mean difference is 28.38 — 24.95 = 3.43, and the sum of the mean fluctuations 1.69 + 2.46 = 4.15. If, in consequence

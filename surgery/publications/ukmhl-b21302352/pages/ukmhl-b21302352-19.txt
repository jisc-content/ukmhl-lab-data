ON THE 1 LARYNGOSCOPE AND ITS EMPLOYMENT IN PHYSIOLOGY AND IN MEDICINE. CHAPTER I. HISTORY. The present is not the first occasion that, by the aid of a mirror attached to the end of a stem, and placed at the back part of the mouth, the study of the larynx in the living has been conceived, for the purpose of illustrating its physiology and pathology. Already in 1840, Liston1 mentioned the successful employment of this instrument in medical practice; and in 1855, Garcia2 published a series of laryngoscopic researches as to the formation of the voice. Nevertheless, it seems that the observations of Liston have been completely forgotten, and that the brilliant results obtained by Garcia,, viewed by prejudice, have excited only mistrust and doubt. 1 ‘Practical Surgery/ with 50 engravings on wood, by Robt.

221 ARITHMETIC MEANS. observations of four days each cannot afford the least ground for a conclusion, has been already indicated. And the author in fact regrets that he was unable to prolong his investigations any further, but adds (page 45), that, nevertheless, the results he has obtained are reliable ! Let us see how far his ideas of reliability extend. The Means of the two series for the elements above referred to are— Amount of Urine. Urea. Sulphuric Acid. Phosphoric Acid.

How little, how- ever, this difference is to be relied on, will appear if we note the inequality of the numbers from which these Means have been drawn. We will, first deal with the amount of the urine. It is not, indeed, upon the influence of the sea on the general urinary secretion that the principal emphasis is laid, the increase or diminution in the latter being for the most part attributed to diminished or increased cutaneous transpiration; yet it is interesting to observe the way in which the author deals with his numbers. The four observations from which the Means 1317 is drawn are— 937. 1789. 1432. ma; those from which the Mean 1469 is deduced are— 1339- *45*- I5*6- 1560. The most cursory glance will show how little inference could be drawn from these very unequal numbers as to what the following ones would have been if the observations had been continued some days longer, and, therefore, what small ground there is for assuming

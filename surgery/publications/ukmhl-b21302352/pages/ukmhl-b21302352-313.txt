ON THE USE OF COLD IN SURGERY. The use of cold as a remedy for liypersemic and inflammatory conditions is not duly appreciated by most physicians and surgeons of the present day. Though there are few medical men who alto- gether deny the antiphlogistic action of cold, there are still many who consider it a superfluous remedy, or who restrict its use within very narrow limits, and are fearful of the injurious effects which a too extensive application of it might produce. I am therefore prepared to meet with very decided opposition from many quarters when I venture to express my belief that, of all remedies which are at our command in the treatment of inflam- matory processes, cold is the most important, and to assert that without this remedy I would rather not be a surgeon. Differences of opinion on this subject are, as is well known, not merely modern. If we look back into the history of surgery, we find that by physicians of the most ancient times cold was sometimes esteemed as a powerful antiphlogistic remedy, and sometimes de- preciated as ineffective or dangerous. Thus Hippocrates, and after him, Celsus, recommended the application of cold water to recent injuries of the most various kinds ; while Galen, on the other hand, used only warm water and warm oil to wounds, and did so, probably, in consequence of experiments he had made on the effects of snow and cold water upon the tissues of the body. Aetius, who lived in the middle of the sixth century, praised anew the use of cold water in the treatment of recent injuries, and in some cases even made use of cold affusion. 18

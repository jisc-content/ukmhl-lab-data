220 THE IMPORTANCE OF (a) Beneke* s researches on the influence of Sea Air and Sea Water upon the Metamorphosis of Tissue.â€”In his work f On the Influence of Bathing in the North Sea/ Gottingen, 1855, Beneke has com- municated a series of researches which he instituted on himself, and from which he draws the following results: In addition to its general influence in diminishing the amount of urine, sea-bathing has the specific effect, on the one side, of increasing considerably the excretion of urea and sulphuric acid, and, on the other, of diminishing at the same time the excretion of phosphoric acid. The first of these results is an indication of augmented meta- morphosis of tissue; the second is an indication of the gain of the body in organic material. Moreover, residence in the sea air acts by augmenting the amount of urine, its influence on the most important constituents of the urine being the same as that of sea- bathing, except that the diminution of phosphoric acid is still more marked. Let us now examine whether, and to what extent, this result is really founded on the numbers adduced. With the view of determining the effects of a residence inland, Beneke had instituted at Oldenburg a series of researches, previous to those at Wangeroge, of five, fourteen, and four days respectively, viz., from the 5th to the 10th of January, from the 8th to the 31st of February, and from the 5th to the 8th of July; and after his return from Wangeroge (which was on the 17th of August) two series of researches of three days each, viz., from the 29th to the 31st of August, and from the 12th to the 14th of September. For the determination of the influence of the sea air, a series of observations of four days, from the 13th to the 16th of July, was undertaken, and for that of the sea-bathing two series, one of seven days, from the 17th to the 23d of July, and one of eight days (in which, however, no bath was taken on two of the days), from the 4th to the 1 ith of August. In order to determine the influence of the sea air, Beneke com- pares the four days (from the 13th to the 16th of July) in Wan- geroge, not with the three series of Oldenburg, but only with the last of them, with the four days in July, on the supposition, it is true, that its result does not differ to any important extent from that of the first two series. But we shall see that, instead of doing so, the latter rather tend to negative the results of the July series of observations than otherwise. That the comparison of two series of

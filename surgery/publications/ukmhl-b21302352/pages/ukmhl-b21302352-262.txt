228 THE IMPORTANCE OF is too exceptional a supposition to be adopted, without corrobora- tion by a specially instituted and scrupulous series of researches. The numbers here brpught together do undoubtedly lead to the supposition, although they do not prove, that both of these sub- stances were excreted in increased quantities. (b) Examination of some investigations by Boecker. We will first consider a series of observations made during four days by Boecker, on a single individual, with the view of determining the action of sarsaparilla, and afterwards those which refer to the amount of urine excreted. A superficial glance at the numbers and their -ultimate Means enables us at once to perceive that they do not exhibit any obvious influence upon them by this medicinal agent; but our object is not so much to corroborate or impugn the results he has drawn from them, as to use them as an illustration of the com- plete treatment of the figures. The two series of observations in question have been quoted in Section I, and will be again produced for the sake of ready com- parison. The observations, during the employment of sarsaparilla, were— M 1467. 1744. 1665. 1225. 1161. 1369. 167 5- 2129. 887. 1643. 934- 2093. The series of normal observations • was— (*) 1263. 1740. I538- 1326. 1387. 1422. I754- 1320. 1809. 2139. I574- 1114. The successive Means of the first series are— 1606. 1625. 1524- I45I* i438- 1472. I554- I480. 1496. 1445- i499. Those of the second are— i5OI< 1514. 1517- 1491. I479* 1519. 1494. 1529. 1590. 1588. I549* The fluctuations hi series {a) and (b) will be seen to be very consi- derable, and even those hi the Successive Means are sufficiently great to enable us to conclude that the obviously evident periods in these series are not the only ones to be determined, but that longer periods, or considerable and irregular disturbances, must have operated. This would, therefore, be a case in which, in order to

322 ON THE USE OF the eye does not bear moisture well, and the constant changing of the compresses irritates this delicate organ so much that the bene- ficial effects of cold have no chance of showing themselves. If the eye-doctors would only make use of proper ice-bags, such as, when filled with small pieces of ice, adapt themselves easily and without pressure to the closed eye, they would soon become convinced of the excellent effects of cold in most ophthalmic inflammations. In applying these ice-bags it is best to cover the eye with a piece of lint, and to keep the bag in position by passing a piece of tape through the three india-rubber rings which are attached to the bag, and then tying it round the head. It is true that in inflammation of the deeper structures of the eye, attended by increased pressure within the organ, no favorable results are derived from the use pf cold, and that we cannot do without the important remedies which modern ophthalmology has made known to us. But in all forms of inflammation of the more superficially seated parts of the eye, as the lids, the conjunctiva, the cornea, and even the iris, cold is often much more efficacious than repeated bleeding. Catarrh and blen- norrhcea of the eye disappear rapidly in most cases under continuous abstraction of heat, and in eczematous inflammations of the con- junctiva and cornea, which are so common, and which are described by authors under such various names (scrofulous ophthalmia, pus- tular ophthalmia, and so on), no other remedy removes so rapidly as dry cold the inflammatory symptoms and the intolerance of light connected with them. In many cases of the kind, after the patient has been treated and tortured for a long time without effect by tartar-emetic ointment and other painful counter-irritants, I have seen the intolerance of light disappear under the treatment by cold in a comparatively short time. Even those forms of iritis which are produced by the patient's catching cold run a more favorable and rapid course under the treatment by cold than under that by atropine alone, or by other remedies which are efficacious in these cases.1 1 I feel bound to mention that as early as in 1846, when I was a student at Gottingen, I had the opportunity of seeing cold used in most cases of inflam- mation of the eye which happened to come under the care of Professor Ruete, my esteemed master. He made use of cold with great perseverance, and often with such remarkably favorable results that I was even then convinced that the efficacy of this powerful remedy mainly depends on its being applied in a proper way.

Therefore, the mean fluctuations indicated in Section VII, bv \x and v, are 386 and 268; and their sum, 674, is, consequently, considerably greater-than the mean difference, 1549 — 1499 — 5°; which is more than sufficient to indicate a negative result . Of the elements of the urine, it is only necessary for us to refer to the potash and phosphoric acid; to the potash, because it exhibits the greatest mean difference, and therefore offers the greatest proba- bility of a positive result; and to the phosphoric acid, on account of the interest which this element possesses. For the potash the series of normal observations is— m 1.55. 2.22. 1.67. 2.52. 1.38. 2.75. 3.81. 1.56. .30. .51. .89. 1.00; and that of the sarsaparilla observations— (/) 3-55- 2.81. 3.38. 1.79. 3.56. 3.10. 2.25. 1.85. 2.58. 4.56. 2.02. 3-29-

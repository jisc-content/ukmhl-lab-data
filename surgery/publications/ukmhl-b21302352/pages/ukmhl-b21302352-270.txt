THE IMPORTANCE OE ,236 of his room was maintained in constant uniformity with that of the external air, and the mean temperature noted at intervals. Equal care was bestowed upon the chemical determinations. After such exactitude in the process of investigation, we may readily assume that the results which the author deduced from it are admissible; and it is for this reason that I here undertake to examine some of them by way of example. The investigations lasted, almost without interruption, from the 28th of April to the 28th of July, and are divisible into six series of twelve days each, and one of fifteen days. During the series there was taken daily of common salt, successively, o gramme, 5 gr., 10 gr., 15 gr., 20 gr., 25 gr., 30 gr.; or, including that contained in the food) 1-5 gr-) 9-3 8r-> !4-3 gr-> 19.0 gr., 23.9 gr., 28.7 gr., 33.6 gr. I will first dispose of the series of observations on the quantities of the urine (corresponding to those of salt ingested), with their suc- cessive Means, and the Probable Means deduced from these latter. Since the differences between the Successive Means seldom reach or exceed 8 per cent., the Arithmetic Mean of the last eight observations is in round numbers assumed as the Probable Mean, and the greatest fluctuation between them as the uncertainty ; by which assumption the uncertainty will certainly be more likely to be rated too low than too high.

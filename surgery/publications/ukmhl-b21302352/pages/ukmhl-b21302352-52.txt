LARYNGOSCOPE. 34 Section VI.—Of the Local Treatment of the Larynx. Thanks to the laryngeal mirror, the eye becomes the guide to the hand, and a new field of practice is granted to medical and surgical diagnosis and treatment. Our first trials already showed the possibility of a more minute and safe local treatment, and I hope will encourage physicians to adopt that course. In fact, I have succeeded in introducing a sound into the larynx, to ascertain the resistance which was offered by certain parts in a state of disease; besides, I have passed into it a sponge attached to a curved stem, and saturated either with glycerine or a solution of nitrate of silver; it has been even possible for me to cauterize a spot, previously made out, as for example, the arytenoid cartilages, one or other of the vocal cords, &c. (see Chapter V, Cases 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 13). • The proceeding which I adopt is exceedingly simple; nevertheless, it is necessary, on the part of the operator, to possess a great steadi- ness of the hand and much practice of its application. It consists in holding the laryngeal mirror with one hand, and with the other to quickly introduce the sound, or the caustic holder, being guided by the image of the laryngoscope.1 Tor the performance of certain surgical operations in the larynx, I would advise throughout the galvanic cautery, which, besides possessing many other important advantages, has also that of not producing any haemorrhage. 1 Nevertheless, this method yet admits of some improvement. For instance, we might transfortn the stem of the laryngoscope into a tube, filled with a liquid or a powder, and taking such steps as shall always force the medicament to escape in a direction known beforehand; guided also by the image, we shall be certain of reaching the diseased spot. During my last visit to London I gave particular and full instructions to Messrs. Weiss and Son, Strand, for the manufacture of such an instrument.

LARYNGOSCOPE. 68 Fig. 26. Tig. 26. Accidental growth beneath the angle of insertion of the vocal cords, and above the right superior vocal cord. Cttshiou of the epi- glottis very prominent. A laryngoscopic examination, on the 14th of July, gave the following results (Fig. 26):—everything is normal on the left side; a projecting and flattened cushion of the mucous membrane exists above the right superior vocal cord; we can perceive an accidental growth, of a smooth and globular form, immediately beneath the angle of insertion of the infe- rior vocal cords. Case 18.—Polypus on the left inferior vocal cord, causing very slight hoarseness. M. B.

It was moveable, and was found to be some- times squeezed within the glottis by the current of air, and sometimes it projected. When the glottis was moderately open, the polypus touched the border of the right inferior vocal cord, and adjusted itself to this border, which was here depressed and swollen. The examination, repeated on the 9th and 22d of June, 7th and 14th of July, and the 14th of October, did not reveal any remark- able alteration. Fig. 27. Polypus of the left in- ferior vocal cord. Case 19.—Large epithelial muriform polypus, developed within and above the glottis. J. C—, shoemaker, 25 years of age, has been hoarse since the carnival of last year, and has had aphonia for four months; the cause of this, he thinks, is some obstacle in breathing within the

CHAPTER IV. PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Before communicating my own observations made by the aid of autolaryngoscopy (f Bib./ No. 8), I must first confirm the correctness of the results published by Garcia, in relation to the following points: 1st. In quiet breathing, the glottis remains widely open. 2d. The arytenoid cartilages perform very rapid and independent movements, when the glottis is contracted during pronunciation. 3d. During the emission of sounds from the chest, or of a shrill voice, the epiglottis assumes a different position, and is more or less distant from the arytenoid cartilages. 4th. The superior vocal cords1 exert no influence upon the pro- duction of the voice; this is only produced, as J. Muller has proved, by the vibrations of the inferior vocal cords, distinctly to be seen, unless the sounds are too high, when the vibrations are so numerous as to become imperceptible (“ the inferior ligaments, at the bottom of the larynx, form exclusively the voice, whatever may be its register or its intensity, for they alone vibrate at the bottom of the larynx”).2 I reserve for future consideration the other assertions put forth by Garcia. Section I.—General sketch of the Internal Arrangement of the Larynx during 'Respiration. When I examine the depth of the pharynx with my autolaryngo- scope, the head being previously inclined backwards, the mouth widely open, and the tongue flattened, without protruding from the mouth, I perceive, in the almost semilunar space bounded by the 1 The upper folds of the glottis, the superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments, or the false vocal cords. 2 Garcia, op. cit., p. 221.

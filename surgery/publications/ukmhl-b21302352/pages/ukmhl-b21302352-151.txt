CASE OF ATROPHY OF THE LEFT HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN, WITH COEXISTENT ATROPHY OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BODY, Among the numerous lesions of the body met with in the course of anatomical investigations, those involving disturbances of the most important and noblest parts, and especially of the brain, are in many respects deserving of the greatest consideration. This is particu- larly true in reference to the close connexion between the brain and the rest of the body, which still presents so many unsolved inquiries to the physiologist. Although it is generally known that the brain, as the seat of ope- ration of our higher faculties and of volition, stands, by means of the spinal cord and nerves, in the most intimate relation to the rest of the body, disseminating through the entire system the orders of our will along the nerves as so many telegraphs, and receiving in return impressions from without, the varied influence of the cerebrum on the remainder of the organism is by no means limited to these func- tions ; on the contrary, it extends far beyond them. Our body is, in fact, a whole, all the parts of which are not only most intimately connected with one another, but every separate part of which acts more or less upon the whole, and, according to the different extent of its sphere of action, contributes in a greater or less degree to the main- tenance and regular working of the entire system. In this respect the nervous system occupies a first place, and its influence, not only

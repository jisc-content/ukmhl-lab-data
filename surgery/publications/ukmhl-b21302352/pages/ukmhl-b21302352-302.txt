THE IMPORTANCE OE 268 most exact mathematical estimates of the numerical series involved will give them a feeling of certainty. If, on the other hand, the har- mony with well-known physiological facts is evident, there will be less doubt; and, however much further examination may be desirable, the result obtained will, nevertheless, on independent grounds, deserve consideration, as throwing light upon the question under investigation. What we seek in all our chemico-physiological inves- tigations is not the whole truth; all that they can do is to give us a nearer acquaintance with certain principles, and a nearer insight into the chain of vital phenomena under varying conditions. I have thus generally mentioned the principal objections which I feel compelled to offer to Professor Radickeks recommendations, but shall refrain from any more minute discussion of individual points. I repeat, that I consider a precise and mathematical exa- mination of the numbers of such chemico-physiological investi- gations as we are at present discussing, as well as a careful valuation of the individual numerical series as most desirable; I thank- fully recognise the instructiveness of Professor Radicke's labours in several points, and have not perused them without advantage; nevertheless, I maintain that the physiological tact and knowledge of the experimenter appears to me as of more importance than the mathematical; that it is only the greatest possible repetition of the observations on different persons and under different circumstances, that can give any positiveness to our results ; and I cannot certainly consider it a misfortune that we provisionally retain our older me- thod of determining mean values so long as we do not place too much reliance upon single results, recognise the amount of uncer- tainty generally existing, and make the number of our observations long and decided enough both for the question under investigation, and for the experimenter himself.

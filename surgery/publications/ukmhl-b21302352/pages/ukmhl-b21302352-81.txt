PATHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 63 Case 8.—Hoarseness bordering on aphonia, associated with severe pain in the ivindpipe; application of glycerine within the larynx. I examined on February 5th, 1859, a young female, affected one or two days since with hoarseness bordering on aphonia, the result of a violent cold, associated with severe pains in the windpipe. In spite of her great uneasiness and awkwardness, I was enabled to see the larynx completely, and the commencement of the trachea, in depressing and bringing forwards the tongue by means of a depressor. The whole of the laryngeal mucous membrane exhibited an active injection of the ramifications of the superficial vessels, so that they could be clearly distinguished on their yellow back- ground. After consulting with a colleague present, and guided by the laryngoscope, I touched the larynx with a sponge dipped in glycerine. Case 9.—Syphilitic ulcer of the lower lip ; pain in the larynx, with redness and a small ulcer ; cauterization with the solid nitrate of silver ; an attach of haemoptysis. A young man, M. E. S—, contracted a syphilitic ulcer on the lower lip, on kissing a female; at least, so he said. : A short time afterwards, pain was felt in the left side of the larynx. On examining him with the laryngoscope, on the 7th of June, I observed extensive redness of the mucous membrane of the left side, and at the origin of the superior vocal cord, close to the arytenoid cartilage, an ulcer of the size of a millet-seed, covered with lardaceous pus. This ulcer was cauterized with the pencil of nitrate of silver, but incompletely; it was visibly improved under the influence of general treatment. O11 the 20th of June, haemo- ptysis suddenly took place. Some hours after this occurrence I examined the patient, and found the anterior wall of the trachea, up to the cricoid cartilage, yet covered with a thin layer of coa- gulated blood,

THE IMPORTANCE OF 198 category now under consideration, since it gives us the amount of chloride of sodium determined in the urine during twelve consecutive days, and consequently not the measurement of a single and invariable quantity; but, as all we want is an illustration for the purpose of demonstration, we will, in using it, assume that the composition of the urine remained unaltered throughout these twelve days. By taking the successive Means, we get As the Mean for the first •2 days . , 24.2365 )> 33 33 33 3 33 • • 23-9377 33 33 33 33 4 33 * • 23.8533 33 33 33 33 5 33 • • 24.2940 33 33 33 33 6 33 • * 24.0950 33 33 33 33 7 33 • • 24.1544 33 33 33 33 8 33 • • 24.0530 33 33 33 33 9 33 • • 24.3 J38 33 33 33 33 10 33 • • 24.1474 33 33 33 33 11 33 • • 24.O967 33 33 33 33 12 33 • • 24.0590 It will be observed that all the Means 1, from the 1 third downwards, agree in their first two figures, and we are, therefore, justified in re- garding them (i. e., the figures 24) as certain. It is not even necessary for this purpose to exclude the first three Means, since the second differs by less than one unit, and the third by less than two units of decimals from 24. In the third figure, however (i. e., the first decimal),there is no evident approach to uniformity; yet we see that all the numbers differ from 24 by less than .4, and we may therefore conclude that the real value lies somewhere between 24+.4, and 24— .4, i. e., if we take 24 as the round number, the limit of uncertainty will be .4. It will be still more desirable to take the Arithmetic Mean of the first decimals as the basis for our general Mean, so that in the fluctuations of the first decimals no preference may be given to any one of the successive Means above the others. The successive Means, leaving out all but the first decimals, are— 24.2. 23.9. 23.9. 24.3. 24.1. 24.2. 24.1. 24.3. 24.1. 24.1. 24.1; consequently the Arithmetic Mean of the series = 24.1, and the greatest divergence from 24.1 is only .3, since all the suc- cessive Means lie between 23.85 and 24.32; so that for all practical purposes we may assume 24.1 as the value of the Mean, with an uncertainty = .3.

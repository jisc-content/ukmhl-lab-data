86 THROMBOSIS OR THE the constituents of the atmosphere.1 To the circumstances just mentioned must he added a property of the blood important for the growth of thrombi, the rudiments of which are mostly small, viz., the property of a tendency to coagulation from coming into contact with clots already formed, or with rough surfaces and foreign bodies which find their way into the vessels, as obtains in the process of crystallization. Lastly, it may fairly be assumed in many cases that an increased coagulability of the blood during life, as observed in various specimens of blood taken from the vessels, favours the for- mation of clots within the vessels, although we must be very cau- tious before we make such an assumption in a given case. Virchow has already called attention to the circumstance that there are three localities in the body which, from their anatomical character and position, especially favour a retardation of the motion of the blood, and consequently its coagulation during life, viz., the veins of the lower extremities, the veins of the true pelvis, and the sinuses of the brain, and of the latter more particularly the longitu- dinal and lateral sinuses. In the sinuses it is the dilatations of calibre and projecting partitions in the walls which are said to favour coagulation. To this I would add that the peculiar form of the canals in this portion of the venous system and the relations of circulation proper to the cranium furnish further elements which may tend to retard the current, and thereby favour coagulations in the sinuses. The form of the canals, which in other portions of the venous system is for the most part circular, is in most of the sinuses quite another, and the thoroughly three-cornered form of the canal of the superior longitudinal sinus deviates, above all, from the ordi- nary conditions. By this deviation from the circular form of the canal the relation of the walls of the sinus to the current of blood flowing through it is essentially changed, and that in such a manner that the proportion of surface of the walls of the sinus to the quan- tity of blood is greatly increased. But it is clear that in vessels whose form differs from the cylindrical, the frictional resistance and 1 Briicke has, it is true, recently shown, by his skilfully conducted investi- gations, that the death of the walls of the vessels is closely connected with the coagulation of the blood within those vessels; but the results of his inquiries apply chiefly to the phenomenon of coagulation in the dead subject, and not to the coagulation of the blood in living vessels.

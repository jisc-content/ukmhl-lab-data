But as these two series correspond to the largest doses of salt and the lowest temperature, we may readily agree to regard the excess as the effect of the salt, or of the temperature, or of both agencies com- bined. Kaupp elects in favour of the first of these agencies, and, in order to justify his assumption, compares the Means of series I, II, and VII (in which the three highest doses of salt occur) with those of the four other series, and infers therefrom an increase of

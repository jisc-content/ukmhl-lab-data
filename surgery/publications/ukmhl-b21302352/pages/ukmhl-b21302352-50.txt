LARYNGOSCOPE. 32 Eustachian tube; and the inferior tumour, which was much smaller, embraced the anterior and inferior limit of the same orifice. The two tumours were of a much darker colour than that of the sur- rounding mucous membrane, and when they were touched with a sound introduced in the course of the rhinoscopic examination, they exhibited a firmness which was well marked. The pathological observation which lias been described presented no other important or fresh results in the diagnosis of the patient's affection, which could be realised very well by means of the data of the ordinary otiatric method; but it completed the description of the disease in a satisfactory manner, and demonstrated the utility of the rhinoscopic method, and the possibility of employing it, without which we should never have arrived at a sufficiently complete de- scription of the disease. The preceding observations seem to prove that the rhinoscopic method succeeds sometimes readily, even when the velum palati is in a perfectly normal condition, and that the further completion of it promises to give the best results. Whilst on this subject, I may be permitted to revert to the principle which served as a basis for the construction of a demi-tube with a mirror (see Eig. io); because this temporary instrument, or an analogous one (perhaps with a moveable mirror, or with two mirrors), ought to render possible the examination of this cavity even in cases where the application of instruments is unusually difficult, and provokes the reflex phe- nomena which especially appear, when the operation is done without proper discrimination. It is only in the future, when the impulse which I have given to the subject shall have been followed for some time, that we can at- tempt to judge to what point the local depression of sensibility by means of cold water, of anaesthetics, narcotics, or the patients getting used to it, on the one hand, and the gradual increase in the powers of dexterity of the physician, on the other, may facilitate the use of the rhinoscopic method, if not favoured by circumstances. I would advise those who seriously desire to oceupy themselves with this subject, to commence their preliminary studies upon the dead, in order to make themselves familiar with the regions which have occupied us, and the better to judge of the relative positions of the parts concerning which our knowledge is not so perfect, and of which the image in the mirror is in no wise familiar to us. The rhinoscopic examination, as I have proved by experience, presents

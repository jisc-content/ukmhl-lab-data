It has been thought desirable that Professor Radicke’s paper should be brought under the notice of the profession in England through the medium of the influential circula- tion of the New Sydenham Society for two reasons—first, because there is no treatise readily accessible to the majority of readers in which the subject is so compen- diously discussed, and in a manner so adapted to the capacities of those who have not enjoyed the benefit of special mathematical training, as in this paper; and secondly, because in the form in which it was originally published it could only be consulted with difficulty even by those who possessed the resources of the metropolis, whilst for those who resided in the country it was almost unattainable. At the same time, whilst the council of the Sydenham Society were taking steps to circulate the cau- tions of Professor Radicke, they felt that they would hardly be doing justice to the controversy which it originated if they entirely ignored the attacks of which it was made the subject. So much of the papers, therefore, in which these were contained has been appended as is necessary to exhibit the grounds upon which Professor Radicke's state- ments could be impugned, as well as to render intelligible the defence with which he has thought it desirable to supplement them.

294 Tig. 5. ON THE USE OE in the case of a young girl who suffered from inflammation of the middle dorsal vertebrae. The apparatus was applied to the parts for fully six weeks, with the best results. Tig. 5 is a similar contri- vance for the neck. A young boy, fifteen years of age, who suffered from rheumatic in- flammation of the vertebrae of the neck, followed by very extensive inflammatory exuda- tion, lay on this box for six weeks, till the pains had quite disappeared, and till the exudation had been almost entirely reabsorbed. These cold cushions, as they may be called, are intro- duced between the bedclothes, so as to allow the back to rest comfortably upon them. I can assert that the patients feel quite at ease on this kind of bed, and that under this treatment the pains will be found to subside much sooner than under any other. I have not yet come to any decision as to the importance of letting patients who are suffering from advanced inflammation of the vertebrse lie on their belly. When I have required them to assume that position I have, of course, used ice-bags. I have also applied similar contrivances, to those represented in figs. 4 and 5, to the extremities. I have then had the upper surface of the water-box, on which the part was to rest, made of a wooden splint. Tig. 6 represents an apparatus of this kind made to fit the arm of an adult. Tig. 6.

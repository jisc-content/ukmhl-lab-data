THE IMPORTANCE OF 246 .08 gramme of urea for each additional gramme of salt. He di- minishes this number, however, to .057 gramme, since he thought that he recognised a definite diminution of the urea under a dimi- nution of temperature, which he took into consideration in his calculations. A second calculation in which he compared the observations in which the temperature was nearly uniform (and in which he also excluded some disturbing numbers) gave him a still lower quantity, .028; and he, therefore, finally decided on .04 as the mean number. In opposition, however, to the assumption that the excess was produced by the chloride of sodium, it must be noted that series III exhibits the next lowest dose of salt in combination with the mini- mum of urea; and any doubt which may exist on the subject rises to certainty when we observe that in series II only the first half exhibits a very high Mean, whilst the second half, on the other hand, gives us one which is comparable with the lower numbers given by the remaining series. The Mean of the first seven days is 37.16; that of the last five is 34.26. On this account, in the above table the two numbers are added to the value of series II, which respectively indicate the values of the first seven and last five days. The con- trast between the two parts of this series is so great, that even the high mean fluctuations taken as the limits of uncertainty do not conceal the excess of the one part over the other.1 Consequently, we are just as little justified in assuming that the high Means in 1 and II are the effect of the salt as of the temperature, since the first part of the second series exhibits nearly the same temperature as the lower number of the second part. The rapid transition from high to low numbers in the Means of a single series, and the gradual increase in passing from the first series into the second, which the Successive Means make very evident, together with the absence throughout of any evident leap from the numbers of one series to those of another, lead to the conclusion that the aggregate of eighty-seven days* observations constitute a continuous series, which is quite indepen- dent of the incident produced by the variation of the dose of chloride 1 If we allow the sufficiency of the Arithmetic Mean as a standard, we may urge against the assumed action of the chloride of sodium the fact that series I has a sensibly lower mean than series II. Moreover, had Kaupp excluded the first two series, and then placed the two series with the largest doses of salt (III and VII) in juxtaposition with the three in which it was lowest, he would have obtained a contrary result, viz., the diminution of urea with the increase of the dose of salt!

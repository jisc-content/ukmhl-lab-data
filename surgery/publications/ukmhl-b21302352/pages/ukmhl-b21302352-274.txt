240 THE IMPORTANCE OE From these numbers the general conclusion will be evident that (in opposition to the one previously drawn) large doses of common salt cause a diminution of the mine, since the (not infrequent) excep- tions in the table may be ascribed to the small number of observa- tions made. With regard to the utility of the numbers thus obtained, it must be remarked, ist, that the number of days compared is much too small to allow us to consider their Mean as of any value; and, 2d, that, in addition, the days compared are not consecutive to one an- other, and, consequently, the observations are unconnected, so that it is impossible to say that there is any comparison of the brief periods of disturbance which are very probably present. Moreover, it will be seen that in the second group, in which the greater number of the observations (viz. 6 and 8) are compared, we have a fall from 2288 to 2249, instead of an increase. The author then reduces the observations in the above groups to two numbers, when they do not already consist of two numbers, bv adding those with large and those with small doses of chloride of sodium, respectively, to one another. Thus, for instance, the num- bers in the second group, belonging to 33.6 and 28.7, those in the third group, to 28.7 and 23.9, and to 14.2 and 9.3, are united, with the following result: Temperature, j Dose of Salt. l Volume of j Urine. Dose of Salt. Volume of Urine. 7°— 9° 33-6 2353 28.7 2502 £-»: 31-2 2258 9*3 2722 n —13 25-3 2259 n-7 2525 13-15° 21.4 2204 T,5 2382 15°—T7° . 21.4 2204 5-4 2218 i7°—19° 19.0 2299 5-4 2198 Mean. . 25-3 2288 10.3 2424 From this table it would be concluded, that a diminution in the dose of salt of 25.3 — 10.3 = 14.9 gr. produced an increase in # the urine of 2424 — 2288 = 136 cub. cent., i.e., a diminution of 9 cub. cent, for each grain of salt. It is unnecessary to remind the reader, that the result would have no claim to certainty even if the difference, 136, did not lay within the limits of uncertainty of the main series.

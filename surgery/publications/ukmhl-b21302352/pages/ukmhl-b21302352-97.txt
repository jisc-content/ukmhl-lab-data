APPENDIX ON RHINOSCOPY. 77 visible ; but the three turbinated bones, and both of the superior meatuses are visible, to a more or less extent. Fig. 31. 1â€”6, section of ilie six upper cervical vertebrae; o, a section of the basilar process of the occipital bone; s, a section of the body of the sphenoid bone and sinus; g, a section of the crista galli of the ethmoid bone; f, a section of the frontal bone and sinus; n, os nasi of the left side; m, the palate process of the superior maxillary bone separating the mouth from the nasal fossae; v, the posterior or pharyngeal edge of the vomer; d, the opening of the Eustachian tube; pu', a section of the soft palate and uvula, indicating the normal position of these parts; pu, the soft palate and uvula drawn forwards and upwards by the hook (K); ph, the pharynx; t, the tongue; j, a section of the inferior maxillary bone; h, a section of the hyoid bone; eL, a section of the epiglottis and larynx; tr, the trachea. The external wall of the left nasal fossa is indicated by dotted lines; a, b, c, the turbinated bones; x, x>, two ditferent positions of the rhinoscopic mirror; xy, xfy>, two different directions of the light and sight. If the mirror is inclined more to one side, it brings into view the lateral wall of the pharyngo-nasal vault, and the orifices of the Eustachian tubes. If the mirror is placed in a lower and more horizontal position, as at os', and the direction of the light and sight, equal y x, the posterior and upper wall of the pharynx is then illuminated and reflected; under these circumstances, the posterior convex surface of Fig. 31.

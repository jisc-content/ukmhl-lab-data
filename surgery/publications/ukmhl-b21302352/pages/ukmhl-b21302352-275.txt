241 ARITHMETIC MEANS. In order to estimate numerically the influence of the temperature, Kaupp proceeds as follows : he groups together observations accord- ing to their temperature only, in such a manner that, in the first- group, all those observations are united in which the mean tem- perature varied from 5.3° to 8.6°; in the second group, those whose temperature varied from 90 to 10.7°; and so on, taking the Mean of each group. The result is contained in the following table, in reference to which it will be seen that the numbers included in the temperature column give the Mean of the limits of tem- perature, and those in the column of urinary qualities exhibit the amount of urine reduced to an equal dose of salt (calculated in a way which will be mentioned hereafter). Temperature. Quantities of Urine. Mean Dose Number of Mean. Min. Max. of Salt. Observations. | 5*3°— 8-6° (7-6°) 2430 (2555) 2088 2904 3i-5 10 9-°°—10*7° (9-6°) 1 2367 (2435) N O 00 2980 25.8 18 ! ii°—12.6° (11*7°) 2406 (2406) 1900 2720 19. ,0 i3°—14*6° (14*1°) 2327 (2317) 1905 2830 18. 11 I i5°-i6.6°(iS.80) 2218 (2154) 1700 2650 12.6 16 170—18.70 (17*6°) 2223 (2159) 1765 2696 12.6 16 | I9.50— 2I.3°(20.6°) 1725 (1648) i59° I9°4 j 15-3 1 6 From these uncorrected numbers it will appear, since they de- crease, if not consecutively, yet on the whole, that a diminution of urine occurs with an increase of temperature, and that for a rise of each degree of temperature there is a diminution of 54 cub. cent, of urine. These numbers are obtained by dividing the difference between the first and last numbers (2430—1725) by the difference of temperature, 20.6 —7.6 = 13. Therefore, notwithstanding the irregularity of the intervening numbers, Kaupp considers the extremes 2430 and 1725 as standards; and, notwithstanding that the difference 2430 — 1725 = 705 is less than the difference between the maximum and minimum in nearly all the rows, he speaks of the diminution as unmistakable ! In consequence of the irregularity of the intermediate numbers,

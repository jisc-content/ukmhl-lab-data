Fig. IV. Section of the cerebrum and its ventricles. a, b, c. Left atrophied half of the brain. The thickening of the arachnoid and pia mater is distinctly visible, and the smallness of the divided convolutions, when compared with those of the other side, is very striking. d, e,f Right and sound half of the brain. The convolutions are here larger, and the white medullary matter around the cavities is much thicker than on the opposite side. g, h, i, k, m. Ventricles of the brain.â€”g, i. Left ventricle, in which, at g, the small, curved corpus striatum, and especially the much atrophied thalamus and the thickened blood-vessel between both, are visible, h. The very much dilated entrance into the inferior ventricle, li, i. The posterior dilated ven- tricle, in which the impressio digitata is very strongly marked, k, m. Right, sound ventricle. 1.

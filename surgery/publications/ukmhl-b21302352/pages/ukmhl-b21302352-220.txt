THE IMPORTANCE 0*F 186 a test does not, and probably never can, exist: all that I can offer is the test which I myself consider a sufficient one in investigations of this kind, and on which my requirements will be based. It is well known that the process usually employed in determining the influence of any given agency, such as nutritive or medicinal substances, baths, &c., upon the metamorphosis of tissue is as follows: An individual is subjected, during a certain number of days con- tinuously, to the influence of the agency in question, with the observation of a manner of life in other respects as uniform as possible, and the daily excretions—more especially, and often excep- tionally, the urine—are determined both with reference to their ag- gregate amount and to the quantities of their most ordinary chemical elements. The data obtained are then compared with those of a second series of days, which may precede or follow the first, and in which the same mode of life is observed, with the exception of the absence of the agency under investigation. The comparison is, however, usually limited to placing the Arithmetic Means obtained from the numbers of the first series of days by the side of those de- duced from the second series, and to concluding, in accordance with the preponderance of the first Means over the second, or vice versa, that the agency in question increases or diminishes the excreta under observation. The urinary quantities are generally determined in cubic centimetres, the chemical elements in milligrammes,1 and a difference in the last one or two figures of these is considered as amply sufficient for the basis of any conclusion. The defect of this method of proceeding lies in the fact that those who employ it do not clearly comprehend the real significance and value of Arithmetic Means, and, as a consequence, have attributed to them a value which in such applications as these they do not actually possess. It will, therefore, be desirable to make some preliminary observations on the different acceptations in which the term “ Arithmetic Mean” may be received, according to the variety of case to which it may be applied. Section II.—Of Mean Values in General. We generally understand in ordinary matters by the term “mean value,” the Arithmetic Mean exclusively; and it is therefore necessary 1 This of course applies to the Continent : the decimal system has not yet made such progress in England as to allow of its universal substitution for the old method of notation, though it is to be hoped that the time is not far off when such will be the case.—Translator.

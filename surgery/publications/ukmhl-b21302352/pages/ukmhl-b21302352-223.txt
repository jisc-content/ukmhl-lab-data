ARITHMETIC MEANS. 189 when we again take the reciprocal value of this latter, we obtain the mean number itself. Thus, if we employ the second of the above illustrations as an example, it is evident that - + - + i is inter- 3 9 8 mediate to - 4- - + ~ and and consequently that the 3 3 3 9 9 9 r> 3 1 Harmonic Mean, ^ , must fall between -—■ =- and i+i+h i+i+l i 3 — i, i. e. between 3 and 9. t + i + t i Moreover, it will be evident that when (as was done previously in ex- plaining the Geometric Mean) we leave the first two of the three num- bers, 3, 9, and 8, unaltered, whilst we substitute for the last a value which descends gradually from 9 to 3, the result must also approximate by degrees from 9 to 3, so that the Harmonic Mean must pass through the same course as the Arithmetic Mean does when treated in a similar manner. (d) A fourth kind of Mean, which has a particular interest for the present investigation, inasmuch as it will be necessary hereafter to employ it, I shall call the Quadratic Mean, for want of a better name, since it has had none hitherto. This Mean is equivalent to the square root of the Arithmetic Mean of the squares of the given num- bers. Thus, for instance, the Quadratic Mean of 3 and 12 = the square root of the Arithmetic Mean of f and 122, i. e. of 9 I4.4> 2 or of or of 76.5, and its value is consequently V76.5 =8*75* In the same way the Quadratic Mean of 3, 9, and 8 =^9_+ , 81 + 64 . . . 3 — v 51.33 = 7.16. The result is on each occasion a mean number because the alterations which the given numbers suffer at the com- mencement, in the process of squaring, are to a certain extent com- pensated in the extraction of the square root which follows; or, to speak more exactly, the Arithmetic Mean of the squares of the given numbers is obviously equal to the square of a mean number and the square root of this is consequently the mean number itself. For example, the Quadratic Mean of 3,9, and 8, viz. V32 + 92 -f 82 5 is obviously less than V92 + 92 + y , and greater than v35 3 + 3‘

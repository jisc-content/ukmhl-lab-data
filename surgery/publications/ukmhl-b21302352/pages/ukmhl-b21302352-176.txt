ATROPHY OP THE 156 But in the bones of the arm we find a completely different state of things. If we look to the table appended to this essay, containing the measurements of the several parts, we shall see that the atrophy is most strongly marked in the clavicle and scapula, and steadily diminishes as we pass downwards towards the hand. If we reduce the difference in length and thickness of these bones to decimals, in order to enable us to compare them accurately, we shall obtain the following results: Length of the clavicle = 129 : 140 = 0-92 ; thickness = 28 : 36 = 0777 „ scapula =136:152 = 0895; „ = „ humerus = 293 : 319 = 0 918; „ = 48 : 59 == o*8i „ radius =197:215 = 0 916; „ = 34 : 40 = 0-85 „ ulna = 220 : 235 = 0-936; „ = 41 : 46 = 0 89 Hence we see that the difference between the several bones is least as regards their length, that the scapula has diminished most in length, and that the ulna presents the least difference, while the length of the hands is exactly equal. As to thickness, the difference is greatest in the clavicle, and presents a decreasing order in the humerus, radius, and ulna; that is, the difference is most marked in the bones, the muscles of which, the deltoid and biceps, are the least atrophied; therefore the bones of the upper arm are most atrophied, while in the forearm and fingers, where the atrophy of the muscles is greatest, the bones present the slightest difference. But if we now reflect upon the action of the muscles, it will at once strike us that this cannot exercise as much influence upon the clavicle as upon the bones of the forearm and hand, which are much more moved by the muscles, while the motion of which the clavicle is capable must always be slight. If, therefore, want of motion and rest were the cause of the atrophy of the bones, the latter should be much more strongly marked in the fingers and forearm than in the clavicle, as this bone is never so much moved, and therefore, from the nature of the case, the difference of motion must be much less in it than in the hand and fingers, the more so as there was no complete paralysis of the upper arm, as satisfactorily appears from the less degree of atrophy present in the deltoid. It therefore seems to me that, in addition to the effects of rest and want of motion, we must also take into account the consequences of diminished direct influence of the nerves 011 nutrition : and this appears to me the more probable when I reflect upon the considerable degree of atrophy which, as I have above stated, was found in the

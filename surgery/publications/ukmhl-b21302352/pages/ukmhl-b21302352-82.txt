LARYNGOSCOPE. 64 Case 10.—Redness and swelling of the superior vocal cords ; with a circumscribed inflammation at the point of insertion of the four vocal cords. Fig. 22. M. E—, aged fourteen years, has had his voice slightly masked for a long time, and he suffered from disagreeable sensations in the larynx; he was subject to frequent colds, but he was otherwise well. I examined him with the laryngoscope on the 4th of May. I introduce this case here, because I could see very easily and completely the whole of the poste- rior surface of the epiglottis and the points of insertion of the four vocal cords (see Eig. 22). The examination showed redness and swelling of the superior vocal cords, and their abnormal ap- proximation during phonation. It was this which explained why the voice was masked.

Case i i.—Tubercles on the right vocal cord, and in the mucous mem- brane between the arytenoid cartilages ; cushion of the epiglottis very prominent. Fig. 23. Fig. 23. Tubercles on the right vocal cord, and on the mucous membrane between the arytenoid cartilages. The cushion of the epiglottis is very prominent. On the 26th of June, I examined a woman, A. K—, with aphonia for two years, and who had been previously affected with syphilitic ulcerations of the velum palati. Eig. 23 shows that the injected mucous membrane of the right vocal cord, and the fold which occupies the intervening space between the arytenoid cartilages were the seat of yellow tubercles. Iodine always brought about some improvement.

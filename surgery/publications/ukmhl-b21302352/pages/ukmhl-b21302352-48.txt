30 LARYNGOSCOPE. Fig. ii. The rhinoscopic examination was made by me in presence of Dr. Hirschler, the 2 2d and 25th of February and the 8th of March of the current year (i860). To perform the rhinoscopic exami- nation of the pharyngo-nasal cavity, I took the same steps as for the laryngo- scopic (see Chapter III, Section IY). I depressed the tongue by means of a spatula, and I slid behind the velum palati, which in this case was sufficiently elevated, a small laryngoscope pre- viously warmed, of which the reflecting surface was turned above and in front. As the velum palati, left free, was suf- ficiently distant from the posterior wall of the pharynx, and as the uvula was remarkably small, the patient at the same time remaining tranquil, we pro- ceeded to examine the pharyngo-nasal cavity, without any other precaution. By this inspection, I soon recognised, in a perfectly normal condition, the poste- rior orifice of the Eustachian tube of the right side; but on the left, I per- ceived a morbid state of the same region. A silver catheter, introduced into the Eustachian tube of the right side, could be observed very clearly, when made to advance and pass through the orifice. On the left side, on the contrary, in con- sequence of the pathological modifica- tions which were present, we could not perceive the catheter introduced into the Eustachian tube, no more than the orifice itself. I11 order to examine the affected part with greater liberty, and on a more extensive scale, I requested the patient himself to depress the base of his tongue with a rectangularly refracted spatula ; and with my left hand I elevated the velum palati in front and above, by means of a flat hook (Eig. 11) with a long stem, assuming the form Fig. 11.

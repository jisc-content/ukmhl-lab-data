244 THE IMPORTANCE OP piration by the skin, such as dry warmth, ought to react upon the amount of excretion by other outlets. The careful observations of Ivaupp, which greatly favour this hypothesis, must, however, * only be considered as favouring, and not as proving it. Amongst the other series of researches contained in Kaupp's paper, the measurements of urea exhibit an especial uniformity; and it is, therefore, well worth while to avail ourselves of this circumstance, which is so favorable to our obtaining a positive result, in order to see if the author is right in ascribing the fluctuations which occur in it to the temperature and to the ingestion of the chloride of sodium. The original observations are given in the succeeding table, but only as far as their first decimals, on account of the uncertainty of their latter ones. The urea in grammes is indicated by H, the mean temperature of the day on which the observation was made by T, and the dose of salt by K. 1 K = 33.6. K = 28.7. K = 19. K = 14.2. I K = 9.3. K = 1.5.

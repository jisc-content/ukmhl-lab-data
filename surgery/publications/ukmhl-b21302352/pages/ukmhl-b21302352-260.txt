THE IMPORTANCE OF 226 Beneke, who assumes the last Means, 1.89 and 1.86, as the standards, and compares them with the above Mean, 1.40, of the four days in Oldenburg, considers the increase of the sulphuric acid as decided, and as much more marked than he supposes to be the case under the action of the sea air alone. Let us, therefore, compare these members with those of the fourteen days’ series in February , which are— 1.5°. 1.62. I.94. 2.01. 1.88. bo 1.80. I-77* Or. OO !.58. 1.65. 1.46. *-55- I-5I of which the successive Means are— 1.56. I.69. 1-77- I*79* 1.80. 1.80. 1.80. 1.76. 1.74. I*73* 1.71. 1.70. 1.69. Hence it will be seen that the last. Mean, 1.69, coincides with that of the four days in the sea air, and that no difference can be per- ceived between the residence at the sea and at Oldenburg, if we consider the ordinary Means as the standard, and assume the four days’ series in July at Wangeroge as reliable. Moreover, it is clear that the Mean of the first five, six, and seven days of the series in February is uniformly 1.80, and consequently that the Mean which the sea-bathing periods give almost coincides with the Mean of an equal number of days of the Oldenburg series. It is quite un- necessary that our examination should be carried any further, to lead us to the conviction (quite irrespective of the fact that Beneke’s process for determining sulphuric acid leaves room for error to the extent of 10-20 per cent.) of the complete groundlessness of the assertion that sea-bathing affects the excretion of sulphuric acid. It now only remains for us to consider the results which Beneke obtained with regard to phosphoric acid, and which he deems to be of especial value. He concludes from the above two Mean numbers, which he has extracted from the two series of four days’ researches in July, that the sea air actively restrains the elimination of phos- plioric acid. These series are as follows : and 00 ci 3-47- 2.82. 2.50; 2.13. 2-34- 2.39. 2.65. Altliough we have shown in the previous sections that four obser- vations alone can justify no conclusion, we have not omitted to introduce these numbers here, in order that we may call attention to

ARITHMETIC MEANS. 187 to point out that, in mathematics, this term is employed in a wider sense. That one of any series of numbers is called their mean value, which, lying between the greatest and least of those numbers, stands in a definite dependence upon the whole of the series. We may, therefore, employ several kinds of means, accordingly as we may find it desirable to exhibit that dependence in one way or an- other ; and the special nature of each .case must determine which kind of mean shall be employed. Those which we most frequently meet with are the following : (a) The Arithmetic Mean.—The relation of this Mean to its series of numbers is, as is well known, such, that the sum of the differ- ences of those numbers which are greater is exactly equal to the sum of those which are less than it. The Arithmetic Mean of the series 3, 6, 9, 4, 13, for instance, is 7; the numbers which are greater than 7 (i. e., 9 and 13) differ from it respectively by 2 and 6; those which are less than 7 (i. e., 3, 6, and 4), on the other hand, respect- ively differ from it by 4, 1, and 3; and the sums of the two series of differences, viz. 2 + 6, and 4 + 1 + 3, are equal in value. If we assume that the differences of the greater numbers are negative, then the algebraic sum of all the differences (in this case — 2 ■— 6 + 4 + 1 + 3) = °. (5) The Geometric Mean.—If n represents the number of figures in the series, the Geometric Mean represents the nth root of the pro- duct of these figures. The Geometric Mean, for instance, of 3 and 12 = ^/3 x 12 — \/^6 — 6) whilst the Arithmetic Mean of the same numbers is 7J. The Geometric Mean also of 3, 9, and 8 = x 9 x 8 = v/^i6 = 6; whilst the Arithmetic Mean of those numbers is 6f. The reason why the result always actually turns out a mean number, and why this number also differs but slightly from the Arithmetic Mean, is, that the extraction of the root is an operation which is antagonistic to repeated multiplication, and therefore the alteration produced by multiplication is to a certain extent neutralized by it. The second of the above Means, for instance, ^3 x 9 x 8, is obviously greater than W3 x 3 x 3 (i. e., greater than 3), but is less than ^9x9x9 (i. e., less than* 9), and consequently lies between 3 and 9 as extremes. If we substitute 9 for the third of these numbers, viz., 8, we get V^3 x 9 x 9, and, therefore, a number which is nearer to >^9 x 9 x 9 than to ^3 x 3 x 3 (i. e., nearer to 9 than to 3).

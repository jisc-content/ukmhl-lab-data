257 ARITHMETIC MEANS. A REPLY TO PROFESSOR RADICKE’S PAPER, “ON THE IMPORTANCE AND VALUE OE ARITHMETIC MEANS/’ By Dr. F. W. BENEKE, of Marburg.1 (From the * Arcliiv fur Physiologische Heilkunde,’ Part IY, 1858.) In Professor Radicke's paper on the “Importance and Value of Arithmetic Means/' the following passage occurs : “ Consequently, the remark which Dr. Boecker, of Bonn, made, when he gave me Dr. Beneke's paper (on the Influence of Bathing in the North Sea, Gottingen, 1854),2 Ghat not one of the results contained in it appeared to him well founded—at least so far as the part contain- ing the researches on the urine were concerned'—is fully confirmed/' This opinion of a professed mathematician, which is expressed in such decided language, affects so severely, and may possibly convey to many readers so unfavorable an impression of my work, that I am compelled to publish the following reply and protest; and, in so doing, it is not merely a defence of my unpretending contribution that I propose to offer, but to discuss a question of general importance in relation to many of our undertakings in the present day.

I shall, in the first place, direct attention to the general part of Professor Radicke's lengthy paper. The author states that, at the request of his friend Dr. Boecker, 1 See ‘Arcliiv fur Physiologische Heilkunde/ 1857, P- 501* 2 As the amount of space at command precluded the insertion of this paper in its entirety, such portions only have been extracted as refer immediately to the general question at issue; the special defence, therefore, which Dr. Ben eke offers of his original investigations, is necessarily excluded. It has also been found requisite to condense slightly some of the passages quoted,— Translator.

201 ARITHMETIC MEANS. equal offers, without question, the less certainty of the two, and must therefore be considered as the least accurate—which fact is expressed by the greater amount of its Quadratic Mean error, whilst, so far as the Arithmetic Mean error is concerned, the two series would appear to be equally accurate. Still less applicable than the Arithmetic Mean are the Geometric and Harmonic Means, since instead of exhibiting a greater mean error for the more unequal series, they would exhibit a smaller one. Tor the sake of comparison, we may here take the mean error of Kaupp's series as given above. The errors, i. e. the differences of the observations from the Arithmetic Mean 34.059, are serially— — .341. — 1.998. — 3.341. — .114. 4- .958. +1.409. + .719. — .453. + .469. + .439. + .716. + .415. The squares of the errors are consequently— .058. 3.993. 5.480. .013. .918. 1.985. .517. .304. .330. .311. .513. .173. The Arithmetic Mean of these squares is 1.190, and consequently the mean error = ^1.190. = 1.091. We, therefore, judge of the value of a series of observations by the magnitude of its mean error, i. e. we say that one series is so many times better than a second series, in proportion as its mean error is less than that of the first; for instance, a series, whose mean error is 6, is six times worse than another whose mean error is 1; or, in other words, the value of the first series is one sixth of that of the 3d. In the same way the value of a third series, tthose mean error is 4.3, would be only in comparison with that of the second of the pre- ceding series. Hence, if we take the value of a series, with 1 as its mean error, at unity, the value of any other series with the mean error n will be expressed by its reciprocal value, i. e. by So that the value of Kaupp^s series = — .917^ I may remark, for those readers who are acquainted with the princi-

188 THE IMPORTANCE OF And if we substitute for 8 the numbers which descend successively from 9 to 3, we get numbers (viz., s/3 x 9 x 9, ^3x9x8, ^3 x 9 x 7, &c., &c.) which diverge gradually more and more, as in the case of the Arithmeti© Mean, from 9, and approach nearer and nearer to 3; so that the Geometric can never differ greatly from the Arithmetic Mean. (c) The Harmonic Mean—In order that I may define this Mean as clearly and succinctly as possible, I must remind the reader that by the reciprocal value of any number is understood that figure which is obtained when we make the number in question the divisor of unity. Consequently, as an illustration, the reciprocal value of 9 = — ; of =2• hence the reciprocal value of a fraction 9 5 5 d" is that fraction inverted. With this explanation, the Harmonic Mean may be defined as the reciprocal value of the Arithmetic Mean of the reciprocal values of the given numbers. According to this definition, we obtain the Harmonic Mean of 3 and 12, for instance, if we take L±*= 5\ 2 24/ the Arithmetic Mean of - and — (viz. -LA, 12 \ and then find its reciprocal value (viz., — = 4J). The Harmonic Mean of 3 and 5 12, therefore, is 4}. In the same way, to obtain the Harmonic Mean of 3, 9, and 8, we take the Arithmetic Mean of i —, and ^ /=t±l±i-4i\ \ 3 216/ 216 . Why we always, as a result of this and find its reciprocal value, viz.. ■3- + ^ + i 4i ,n\ 141 I* process, arrive at a mean number will be clear when it is ob- served that the reciprocal value of the reciprocal value of any number is the number itself again; for instance, the reciprocal 1 8 value of 8 is -, of which the reciprocal value is again -, or 8. The changes which the numbers operated on suffer in obtaining their Harmonic Mean, through the process of taking their reciprocal value, are again to a certain extent neutralized by the repetition of the same process; or, to express it more definitely, when we take the Arithmetic Mean of the reciprocal values of the given numbers, we obtain the reciprocal value of a mean number; and

ARITHMETIC MEANS. 191 No further reference will be made in the following remarks to the Geometric and Harmonic Means; but it appeared to me not unsuit- able to describe them, in order to show the reader that it is possible to employ a considerable variety of Means, some of which are pre- ferable for one purpose, and some for another. I will now return to those which interest us most—the Arith- metic Means — in order to inquire whether and to what extent they exhibit what, in the cases under consideration, they ought to represent, and how far they are applicable to the comparison we are now discussing. So far as the cases are concerned in which the Arithmetic Mean may be employed, this latter may represent either (1) a pure average, or (2) the probable value of a definite and fixed quantity, or (3) the probable value of a variable quantity estimated in its mean condition. The Means with which we have to do in this place belong chiefly to the third of these categories; but inasmuch as they are to a certain extent a combination of the two other va- rieties, it will be advisable to treat separately of the two elements of which this combination is composed, and for that purpose to make some inquiries into their nature. Section III.—The Arithmetic Mean as a pure Average. I call the Mean “a pure average/' when the numbers from which it is deduced are regarded as exact, and are either inde- pendent of one another, or their dependence, if such exist, is not taken into consideration. The average of the ages of a party of individuals may serve as an illustration. Suppose, for instance, that this is 72 years; it does not follow, therefore, that any one person in the com- pany is exactly of this age, or even that the ages of the majority approach to it; but, as the character of the Arithmetic Mean, given in the previous paragraph indicates, that the sum of the ages of those persons who are above 7 a is equal to the sum of the ages of those who are younger than 72; hence all of them would be of the mean age, if the older could transfer to the younger so much of their superiority in years as would make them all equal. If, now, we wfish to institute a comparison with a second and equally numerous company of persons, whose average age is 67

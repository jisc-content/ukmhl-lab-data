250 THE IMPORTANCE OF The nearest number to this in the table is 38534, of which the root given in the table is 1.963. We shift the stop two places, and get 196.3 as V38543’. JBy the help of these tables the mean fluctuation may be found with very little trouble. Section XII.—Conclusion. In the preceding pages I believe that I have exposed, in a way that will be intelligible to medical readers wTho are not proficient in mathe- matics, the principles upon which conclusions should alone be deduced from any given series of observations, and that I have placed them in a position to deal with any observations they may make, in such a manner as to obtain certain results. Unfortunately, in the numerous pharmacological and balneological papers which, in addition to those cited above, I examined, hardly a tithe of the results published can be looked upon as certain. It will, therefore, give me much satis- faction, if this contribution of mine should attain its object, and should be of some use in developing the important branch of medical science, of which investigations of this description are the basis.

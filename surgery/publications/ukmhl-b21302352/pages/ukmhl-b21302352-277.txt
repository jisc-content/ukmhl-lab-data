243 ARITHMETIC MEANS. The difference of the mean quantities of urine,, 2421 — 2171 = 250, divided by the difference of the Means of the mean degrees of temperature (15.4 — 11.7 = 3*7), which gives 68 (erroneously 71 in the text) is the amount of change in the volume of the urine for i° of temperature. Here numbers that are not inaccurate, by being united with num- bers that are so, are made still more inaccurate; and we should, there- fore, view the result as one of approximate correctness, if the indi- vidual Means employed possessed the requisite degree of accuracy. Whether this latter is the case here is very doubtful, for the individual Means of the urinary quantities are deduced only from six observations, and these taken on days very remote from one another; so that their certainty, as might be expected, is very much less than that of the Means of the original series of twelve days; and even these consecutive Means are taken from different periods, in which the influences at work may have been of varying value. The juxtaposed Means of the last table are certainly favorable to the assumption previously made as to the influence of temperature, in so far as they exhibit, in five out of the seven, a higher value for the lower temperatures; but, in the rows in which the difference is most manifest, it also happens that the unusually high numbers of the damp days above mentioned coincide with the lower temperatures; and it is also suspicious that the number 2288 011 the left has nearly the same mean temperature with the number 2531 on the right, as has the number 2339 with 2130; con- sequently, observations instituted at a uniform temperature exhibit greater differences than the mean numbers taken for comparison from more extreme temperatures do. The combination, too, rests upon the improbable supposition that the change of volume of the urine is proportional to the variation of temperature. The near coincidence of the result 68 with the number 70 first obtained is undoubtedly purely accidental. If I have here argued against the assumption which would attribute a diminishing influence to temperature, it is not because I think it an improbable one, but only with the view of proving that the observations under consideration, and especially the method of determination employed, admit of 110 conclusion being drawn from them in reference to this point. In reality, so far as my own per- sonal opinion is concerned, I believe on rational grounds that such an influence is probable, since everything which increases trans-

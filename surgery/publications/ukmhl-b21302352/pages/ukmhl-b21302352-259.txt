ARITHMETIC MEANS. 225 of the incompleteness of the single sea-bathing series, we combine the two, we get, as an indication of their value, 28.4 as the Mean, and 1.29 as the mean fluctuation; so that a comparison with the third series gives 3.39 as the mean difference, and 3.75 as the sum of the mean fluctuations. It is obvious that the first bathing series alone, when considered independently of the others, allows us to infer an increase; whilst the second series, and the combination of the two series, which is so much more trustworthy, renders this increase doubtful. It must be re- membered, too, that the series in February was instituted in a com- pletely different season of the year, which must make any comparison with it excessively uncertain; also, that if we were only to employ the first eleven or twelve of the fourteen days in February, a preponder- ance of the fluctuations over the mean difference would again result; and, finally, that if we use the useless series of four days in July, of which Beneke has availed himself, a preponderance of the fluctuations also occurs. But, even if the observations were more certain in their nature than they are, the increase—which, in the altered manner of living, is certainly very likely—might be in no way chargeable to the sea-bathing. The case of the other elements of the urine is more unfavorable still. The observations on sulphuric acid, for instance, in the two series of four days, whose means were given above as 1.40 and 1.68, are respectively— and and ought the more entirely to be discarded, since here, too, two numbers of the upper series, viz. 1.82 and 1.44, so nearly coincide with two of the lower ones, viz. 1.43 and 1.93. Moreover, the numbers of the seven and eight days’ bathing series are, respectively— 1.25. 1.82. 1.44. I.IO ; 1.45. I*93* 1.66. 1.68; M bo Oo I.80. 1.72. I.94. 2.02. I.90. 2.04; I.36. 1.62. I.74. 2.02. I.93. 2.2 6. I.90. and and their Successive Means are— 1.81. 1.78. 1.81. 1.86. 1.87. 1.89; 1.84; and 1.59. 1.64, 1.73. 1.77. 1,85. 1.86. 1.86.

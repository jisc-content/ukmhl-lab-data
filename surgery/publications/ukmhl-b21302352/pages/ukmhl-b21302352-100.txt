APPENDIX ON RHINOSCOPY. 80 mirror, it was felt to be a whitish, smooth tumour, filled with some kind of fluid. I was prevented from further examination of this cavity, leaving Pesth soon after, but I recommended this gentleman, who is a phy- sician, to make himself acquainted with the use of my apparatus for autolaryngoscopy (see Chapter III, Sections III and Y), and to try and examine this curious growth more closely, by autoscopy, and to watch any changes that might occur. Case 4.â€”Frequent catarrh of the nose and fauces ; slight deafness; a tumour dividing the pharyngo-nasal cavity into two parts. The patient in this case I examined in Prague, in December last. He was a young man who has frequently suffered from severe catarrh of the fauces and nasal fossae, and he complained of his hearing being weak, and an unpleasant sensation at the upper part of the pharynx. A rhinoscopic inspection showed the mucous membrane to be very red and thickened, covered by a copious secretion of mucus, and with enlargement of the follicles. Up to the level of the orifices of the Eustachian tubes, and concealing them from view, was a semi- lunar projecting swelling of the mucous membrane, which divided the pharyngo-nasal cavity posteriorly, as it were, into an upper and a lower part. I have not had the opportunity of examining this patient since that time. J. N. C. Prague; January, 1561.

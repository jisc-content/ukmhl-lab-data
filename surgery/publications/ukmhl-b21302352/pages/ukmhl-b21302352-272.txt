If we compare these Probable Means with one another, we shall see that, notwithstanding that the amount of uncertainty is less than a rigorously accurate investigation demands, except in the fifth series, the difference between two mean numbers is in no case greater than the sum of their uncertainties; and that, therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from any of these series as to an increase or a diminution of the urine. The Probable Mean of the fifth series exceeds in respect of its uncertainty those of all the others; but this cannot be ascribed to the salt, for the quantity in this case (9.3 gr.) was not extreme, and the high numbers obtained are found only in one (the first) half of the series; and still less to the temperature, since some of the other series were instituted under a higher, and others under a lower, tem- perature. On the other hand, the first three days are noted as having been especially damp, and those days in the other series which figure as damp occur for the most part in combination with increased excretion; so that it is not altogether unreasonable to con- sider the dampness as the cause of the unusual disturbance in that series, especially as its tendency would be to diminish the other great means of elimination—transpiration by the skin. Let us compare with these conclusions those which Kaupp him- self has drawn from his investigations. He states, in the first place, that “ a reference to the Means shows that, as a rule, large doses of salt gave an increased amount of urine, with some striking excep- tions. The mean amount of urine for the three series of observations

192 THE IMPORTANCE OF years, we are not justified in concluding from this latter fact that'any of the members of the first series are older than those of the second, since the reverse might easily be the case. All that is certain is, that the aggregates of the ages of the two companies would bear to one another the relation of 72 to 67. In the same sense the mean temperature of any one day indicates a simple average. Thus, suppose that this is 120 [Reaumur, equal to nearly 6o° Rah.] ; this means that the aggregrate of degrees of temperature by which the warmer hours of the day have exceeded 120 is equal to the aggregate of those hours in which the tempera- ture fell below that point. And if on a second day the mean temperature indicates 140, it must not be inferred as a consequence that the heat on that day has been greater than on the other; for a day on which the hours at noon were very hot, and the early ones very cold, might have a much lower mean temperature than one in which the general heat was less excessive, and the fluc- tuations more moderate. All that is certain is that, if the heat of each of the two days were diffused over the twenty-four hours,their respective temperatures would be constantly 120 and 140. Hence the subjects of comparison are only the aggregates of temperature. Let us take as a third illustration the quantities of urine given in two series of researches published by Boecker.1 He gave to an in- dividual, whose diet was in other respects exactly estimated, a cer- tain quantity of decoction of Sarsaparilla daily, and found that the quantities of urine passed were in cubic centimetres as follows : 1467. 1744. 1665. 1220. 1161. 1369. 1675. 2129. 887. 1643. 934. 2093. During a second series of twelve days, the individual experimented on took, with the same dietary, instead of the decoction, an equal quantity of distilled water, when the quantities of urine were as follows : 1263. 1740. 1538. 1526. 1387. 1422. 1754- ]320- i8o9- 2I39- j574- 1114. It must be remarked that it is assumed that thesenmnbers accurately represent the quantities of urine excreted, so that the Means of the two series may be taken as representing simple averages. Are we, now, to conclude from these numbers that the Sarsaparilla has di- 1 See Reil’s * Journal fiir Pliarmacodynamik uud Toxicologie/ vol. ii, parts 1 and 2, “ On the Action of Sarsaparilla.”.

THE IMPORTANCE OP 194 those which affected it in the corresponding eight days of the series b. On the other hand, the sum of the influences which operated during the whole of the twelve days in series a was less than that of those acting during the corresponding days of series b. It is possible that the Sarsaparilla may have exercised some influence amongst the other agencies at work; but whether it really did, or not, and whether in the way of augmentation, or diminution, the numbers give us no means of judging. All that they permit us to recognise is that its influence, if present at all, was greatly exceeded and concealed by that of agencies which were extrinsic to the dietary. So that, if we want to draw a conclusion of a medicinal character from the numbers in question, the way in which it should be expressed is somewhat to the following effect:—Sarsaparilla may, or may not, affect the quantity of the urine; but so far as any medicinal value it may have is concerned, it cannot be from its influence on the urine, since that is so much inferior to the influence of other agencies to which we are every day exposed. This, in fact, agrees pretty well with the interpretation which Boecker himself has put upon his in- vestigations. Section IV.—The Arithmetic Mean as the probable value of a definite9 fixed quantity. When we wish to find either directly or indirectly, by measure- ments, a single quantity of definite value, and the different measure- ments which have been taken by the same or by different methods give, in consequence of the imperfection of the instruments or methods employed, different results, the arithmetic mean value of the numbers obtained is, under the circumstances, the probable value of the quantity of which we are in search; or, in other words, it (the Arithmetic Mean) has, under the circumstances, a greater claim to be regarded as the real value than any of the numbers obtained has. The proof of this proposition is based upon the generally received law, that in the frequent occurrence of any two conditions—with reference to which there is no reason why the one should occur more frequently than the other—the frequency of occurrence of the one becomes more and more equal to that of the other in proportion as the number of instances to be compared increases.

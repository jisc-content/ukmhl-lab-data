27 RHINOSCOPY. and of the nasal fossae, rather than others, are found illuminated and reflected by the mirror. In July, 1859, I performed some rhinoscopic experiments upon a dead body, for the purpose of more readily exposing those regions, till then inaccessible to view, and for the better appreciation of the bearing of my new method of exploration. These again convinced me that in this way we can expose to view the posterior wall of the velum, the walls of the pharyngo-nasal cavity up to the sphenoid bone, the orifices of the Eustachian tubes, and the extent of the posterior orifices of the nasal cavity as well as the turbinated bones. I did not perceive the floor of the nasal cavity, nor of the inferior meatus ; but we might succeed in doing so by using double mirrors, of which the superior might reflect its objects into the inferior.

In this latter figure the ring with the plate of metal is drawn forwards, and the mirror ss is uncovered. The dots indicate the course of the rays. I should add that I have been able, in concentrating the light upon the nose of the dead body, to make an examination of the parts now become of an incandescent red by reason of their trans- parency, as occurs in the larynx under similar circumstances (see p. 17). The difficulties of rhinoscopy, unless favoured, for example, by insensibility, by fissure, or partial deficiency of the velum, are much graver than those of laryngoscopy. Nevertheless, after the experi- ments which I have made, there is no doubt that perseverance and practice can overcome these obstaclesâ€™ in the one case as well as in the other. 1 By the aid of rhinoscopy I showed for the first time, at Pesth, 29th July,

234 THE IMPORTANCE OF ably exceeds the second, we may assume that the sugar has probably pro- duced a diminution of the earthy phosphates, if we allow the five nor- mal observations to be available for comparison. It deserves, however, to be remarked that the assumption of a diminution requires confir- mation, if we compare the results of the sugar series with those of the alcohol one, instituted nine to twelve months earlier. These latter give the numbers— 2.39. 1.18. 2.01. 2.82. 2.71. 2.96. .94. 1.35. 1.59; which give the Mean 1.99, with the mean fluctuation .72. Hence the mean difference will be 1.06, and the sum of the mean fluctua- tions .87 ; and, consequently, the first number is again greater than the second. The alcohol series gave as the numbers of the earthy phosphates 2.47. 1.28. 1.11. 1.33. 2.04. .99; of which the Mean is 1.54, and the mean fluctuation ’53. Tor the corresponding normal series we get as the Mean 1.99, and as the mean fluctuation .72. The mean difference is, consequently, .45, and the sum of the mean fluctuations 1.25; so that the inference drawn from the Means alone, viz., that the earthy phosphates have diminished, receives no confirmation whatever from a consideration of the fluctuations. Let us, finally, take the entire amount of the solid matters of the urine. The quantities obtained in the alcohol series were— 50.69. 45.70. 45.60. 69.64. 58.11. 54.36. In the corresponding normal series they were— 73.07. 66.70. 73.80. 98.90. 94.72. 101.66. 69.76. 65.12. 100.02. In the sugar series— 57.68. 53.64. 59.83. 59.34. 55.40. 57.83. 53.39. 54.04. 51.03. And in the corresponding fourteen days' normal series— 67.37. 81.73. 59.74. 63.54. 78.97. 66.00. 79.94. 59.16. 78.19. 83.43. 63.33. 63.93. 73.75. 60.18. In the last series, indeed, the fluctuations are somewhat great, but the very uniform successive Means (viz., the series— 74.54. 69.61. 68.09. 7°*27‘ 69.56. 71.04. 69.56. 70.51. 71.71. 70.94. 70.37. 70.77. 69.79)

217 ARITHMETIC MEANS. Section IX.â€”Revision of the conclusions drawn from the pre- ceding Observations, with Rides for the institution and con- duct of neio Investigations. If any one should wish to revise any of the more recently pub- lished series of observations in conformity with the principles laid down in the foregoing considerations, with the view of rectifying the results that have been obtained from them, he must, in the first place, in. view of excessive and continuous fluctuations, lay quite on one side every investigation consisting of not more than three or four days, as, for instance, the ' Investigations on the influence of the internal use of various quantities of ordinary Drinking Water, under different circumstances, upon the Metamorphosis of Tissue in the Human Body/ by Dr. Mosler (prize essay), Gottingen, 1857. I would even, as a rule, lay aside investigations of from five to ten days, if the differences between the single numbers exceed io per cent, of the Mean, and if the Means of the series to be compared do not differ considerably from one another; and, as the results drawn from them might easily be the product of disturbing agencies which had extended their influence over the whole period of observation, I would under no circumstances admit them as of value, except on the condition that other series of observations of at least equal accuracy confirmed them. The question how long series of observations should be in order to justify our drawing an independent conclusion from them, cannot at present be well answered; indeed, an absolute answer is impossible, since the degree of uniformity of the manner of life, the concurrence of certain unavoidable causes of disturbance, the phy- sical condition of the individual subjected to examination, and, in an inferior degree, the accuracy of the observations, will cause differ- ences. In fact, there does not exist a single investigation of suffi- ciently protracted duration to determine even for a single case the point where the compensation of the aggregate fluctuations has reached an evident stage. The more complete series have hitherto seldom embraced more than twelve to fifteen days, and must in every case be regarded still as incomplete. All that remains now is to demonstrate a process by which incom- plete series may be treated, if we wish to guard ourselves as much as possible from falling into error; and with this object in view, I cannot do better than proceed as follows,

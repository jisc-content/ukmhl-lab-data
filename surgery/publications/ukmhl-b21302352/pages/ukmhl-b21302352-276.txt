THE IMPORTANCE OF 242 Kaupp acknowledges that the average obtained, viz., 54 cub. cent., is still too incorrect; and reduces, since he considers the unequal doses of salt as the source of the irregularities, the aggregate Mean to correspondence with a Mean dose of salt of 19 grammes. He had found, as is mentioned above, that an increase of 1 gr. of salt produced a diminution in the urine of 9 cubic centimetres; but, since another combination gave him, instead, the number 11.9, he takes 10 cub. cent, as the diminution caused by 1 gr. of salt, and cal- culates the numbers in the table accordingly, which now, indeed, exhibit an unbroken, though by no means a regular, decrease. The difference of the extreme corrected numbers (2555 — 1648 = 907) divided by the difference of the corresponding Means of temperature (viz. 13) gives him, then, 70 cub. cent, as the more accurate dimi- nution of urine caused by i° of temperature. We see here an uncertain number corrected by one still more un- certain. The uncorrected numbers are already very uncertain, for the reason that they are obtained from days that are often very widely separated from one another; of which the great differences between the adduced maxima and minima give confirmation. The influence of the chloride of sodium is, however, as has been shown above, entirely problematical; so that the corrected numbers are possibly much more inaccurate than the uncorrected ones. We can only conclude, therefore, that the result deduced is entirely a problematical one. Another method of treating the influence of temperature, which is given in the paper, is decidedly superior. Each of the original series is divided into two halves, according as its members represent high or low temperatures, by which means the doses of salt will be equal on both sides, and then the Mean of the two groups so formed is taken. The results are as follows : Series of Mean Volume of Mean j Volume of Observations. Temperature. Urine. Temperature.

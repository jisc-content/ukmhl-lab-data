THE IMPORTANCE OF 356 two series agree with one another in their results, we have therein a guarantee, to a certain extent, that these results are worthy of our at- tention. The amount of increased certainty, which result A acquires by the concordance with it of result B, cannot, it is true, be closely estimated. Still it is obvious that if A gives the same result from forty observations as B does from sixty, the importance of that result will be very different from what it would be if it were based upon one hundred, or two hundred, or even a greater number of ob- servations on A alone. Bor in the case of observations instituted upon A alone, the result might possibly be considerably affected by indi- vidual or external influences which might come into operation during the period of inquiry. But the fact of the results obtained from B being more or less analogous to those from A, gets rid of a certain amount of doubt on this score, always, of course, assuming that we have to deal with a comparatively simple question. By this con- cordance, the limits of error in result A must obviously be to some extent diminished. The calculus of probabilities, however, would disclose nothing to us on this head, or at least it could not do so with any certainty until after several series of researches on different individuals, which in the case of by far the greater number of delicate protracted inquiries on the organism would be as impracticable, as in comparatively simple ones it, fortunately, is superfluous.

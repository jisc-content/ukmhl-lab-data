THE IMPORTANCE OF 258 lie lias undertaken, “ as one who is acquainted with mathematics and physics, to provide medical men with a ready test by which they may try the correctness of the conclusions at which they may arrive,” and to help Dr. Boecker “ to stem the stream of baseless and com- paratively erroneous doctrines, by which medical science is daily threatened to be overwhelmed.” The defect in all processes which have been hitherto employed by us in investigations respecting the metamorphosis of tissue, he states to consist in the want of a clear perception of the import and value of Arithmetic Means, and, as a consequence, in attributing to them an importance which, in applica- tions of this kind, they do not really possess. With reference to the preliminary remarks of our author, I must, at the outset, call in question the competency of mathematicians and physicists as autho- ritative critics of medical and physiologico-chemical matters, unless they are themselves to a certain extent physiologists. Bor my own part, I should wish for nothing more than that we might succeed in defining, with an accuracy which might deserve the epithet mathema- tical, the various phenomena of life, with their numerous and in- teresting fluctuations, and that we might exchange our ever-fluctuat- ing ideas of them for precise and faultless numerical expressions. I believe that more may be accomplished in this direction than has hitherto been done, and that the numbers obtained in researches, and even the researches themselves, have been very inconsiderately em- ployed; and I consider the trouble which Professor Badicke has taken in directing attention anew to this point, and in showing a way to remedy these defects, as worthy of all praise; for if our medical and physiological statistics are to have any real value, they must necessarily be founded upon numbers which are free from avoidable errors. But although, in this point of view, we readily and with good reason allow a certain importance to the mathematical estima- tion and examination of the numbers obtained in our investigations, yet I must maintain a sound physiological discrimination to be superior to this, and on this account I entirely agree with the re- mark which Professor Yierordt makes in answer to Professor Badicke, “ that, in addition to the purely formal and mathematically demonstrable logic of the calculus of probabilities, there is, in many cases, in addition, a logic of the facts themselves, which, when em- ployed in a proper manner and place (i. e., hi questions that are not too complex), carries with it, for the man who is acquainted with his subject, it may be a small, or it may be a high, degree of conviction.”

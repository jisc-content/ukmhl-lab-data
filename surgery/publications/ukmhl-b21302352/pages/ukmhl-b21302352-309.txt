275 ARITHMETIC MEANS. though its employment should be suspended until other investigations, undertaken with the view of ascertaining the same point, shall have given concordant results of at least equal reliability. The limits of conditional reliability here indicated numerically ap- proximate to Lehmann's limits of (complete) reliability, viz., that the mean difference exceed the mean fluctuation of one of the series, in proportion as the two series resemble one another in the degree of their fluctuations; but they differ from them in the fact of taking into consideration the relations, not of one only, but of both the series of observations. I have above pointed out the existence of an arbitrary element hi my rules as to the limits of reliability. In order to indicate generally to those who may not have perused my paper in the f Archiv fur Heilkunde/ the element in them which is not arbitrary (the mathe- matical), I would mention that the arbitrary choice of the limits I have assumed is based—first, upon considerations which depend upon mathe- matical conceptions, viz., upon those of the probable and mean error; and, secondly, upon the principle that we should seek rather to make these limits too wide than too narrow, so as to confer upon the scien- tific application of the results an amount of certainty proportionate to the importance of the question at issue. Whether the considerations which are adduced in my paper on Arithmetic Means are sufficiently convincing, I must leave to competent readers to judge. Whatever may be the result at which they may arrive, the demands which I maintained in that paper are neither greater nor less than those which I made at its commencement, when I stated that “ since an invariably accurate and absolutely reliable standard for estimating the results obtained from observations is impossible, all that I can offer is the standard which I consider a sufficient one, so far as I myself am con- cerned, and I shall base my requirements upon it.”

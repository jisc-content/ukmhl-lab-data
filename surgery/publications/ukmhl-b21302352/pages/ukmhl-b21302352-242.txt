THE IMPORTANCE OF 208 would depend entirely on the variability of p'. We cannot in this case perceive, any contraction of the limits within which the numbers fluctuate, since the number of the observations themselves is comparatively so small. The extremes between which the seven numbers lie are 34.05 and 24.31; their Arithmetic Mean is 24.14; the divergencies of the latter from the seven num- bers represent the fluctuations of the successive Means about the mean number 24.14; and, consequently, the greatest fluc- tuation is 24.31 —24.14 —.ij. If, as stands to reason, on a more extended continuation of the investigation, the fluctuations of the additional numbers did not exceed this amount, we should assume this mean 24.14 as the approximate value of p0+q, i. e. the value to which the Arithmetic Mean of the numbers, when freed * from errors of observation, would approximate if the observations were repeated indefinitely. The quantity /3' above mentioned indi- cates the divergence of this maximum of fluctuation (p0 -f q), which is only to be obtained, by indefinitely repeated observations, from the Arithmetic Mean of the actual observations (freed from errors); hence, in the present case, if q were exactly — 24.14, /3' would — 24.14 — 24.10 = .04, for the twelve days' observations, since 24.10 was their mean. On the supposition that we have reason to conclude that, by con- tinuing the observations, the fluctuations would never transcend .17, we are justified in assuming that number as the limit of uncertainty of the Mean 24.14, and (as the number 24.14 previously assumed for Po + q was not the true but only an approximate value) that the real value ofp0 4- q = 24.14 ±. 17; i- e. in supposing thatp0 + q lies somewhere between 24.14—17 (or 23-97) and 24.14+.17 (or 24.31). If, now, we place by the side of the series referred to, A, a normal series, B, which may in the same manner have given as its result 22.38 + .21, and,therefore, |3=.21, and^0=22.38+ .21, we should be obliged Ho subtract theHiumber 23.38 + .21 from 24.14+ .17 (since we obtain the effect of the dose of chloride of sodium ingested, viz., q, by subtracting^ frompo + q; and here^+# — 24-14 — -W p — 22.38 + .21). A positive result would indicate an increase; a negative, a decrease; a neutral one, no effect at all. But since the numbers to be sub- tracted have a certain amount of inexactitude, and we only know that one lies between 24.14— .17 an(I 24.14 + an^ °fher be - tween 23.38 — .21 and 23.38 + .21, an increase, for instance, is only

CEREBRAL SINUSES. 93 To these twenty cases of thrombosis of the sinuses, with caries of the petrous bone, may be added three others, in which various causes had produced caries of the bones of the skull, with formation of clots and phlebitis of the sinuses. Case 21.1—A woman was seized with pain in the right side oi the head and in the ear, after taking cold during her confinement, which was soon followed by feverish symptoms, and finally by acute indications of pysemia, which caused death nearly four months after delivery. At the autopsy, extensive caries of the temporal bone was found, which extended as far as its point of contact with the occipital bone, and destroyed the cartilages of the suture, with purulent phlebitis of the lateral sinus, and thrombosis of the jugular vein. Case 32.2—A man, set. 42, received an injury of the right parietal bone from a sabre cut. The bone was denuded of periosteum; an abscess formed around the wound; symptoms of bronchitis and of infiltration in the lower lobe of the right lung showed themselves at the same time, and death ensued in four weeks, with delirium and consequent coma. Sectio.—The bone was found denuded to a large extent, and carious; the temporal muscles permeated by veins the seat of purulent infiltration, with the like infiltration of the diploe along the coronal suture in the frontal, parietal, and temporal bones. On the inner surface of the cranium were numerous sieve-like points of suppu- ration. Most of the grooves for the vessels on the inner surface appeared corroded, especially along the longitudinal sinus. The and 58. 3. Heusinger, Yirchow’s ‘Archiv,’ xi, 92. 4.

An examination, made on the 21st of May, gave the following results :—injection of the mucous membrane; thickening of the vocal cords; the development of small, pointed excrescences, in the form of condylomata, upon the borders of the glottis; the presence of creamy liquid pus at the angle of insertion of the vocal cords anteriorly. Case 16.—Conical excrescence upon the inferior vocal cord, with thickening, producing hoarseness; believed to be syphilitic. On the 20th of June, I examined an old rabbi, who came to Pesth, to consult the physicians for a severe hoarseness. I found the right inferior vocal cord thickened, and above it a conical excrescence, of the length of three to four twentieths of an inch, which was implanted near the ante- rior extremity of the arytenoid process.

S—, a rabbi, robust young man, has been often affected with condylomata at the base of the tongue and pharynx; the last time about nine months ago. Hoarseness and cough frequently accom- panied this condition. 1 We know that there exists among the Jews the abominable habit, on the part of the operator, of sucking the yard of the circumcised infant.

THE IMPORTANCE OE 232 so nearly coincides with the sum of the mean fluctuations (1.06), that an increase of potash, as a result of the use of the sarsaparilla, appears probable, which certainly may be caused by an unusually large amount of potash in the drug itself. Finally, the normal series for the phosphoric acid is — (i) 1.46. 1.36. 1.36. I*5I* .94. 1.36. .96. 1.03. .76. 1.04. 1.76. i-i7i and that for the sarsg iparilla- W !-23- *•33- 1.29. .7°. i-57- 1.51. 1.62. 1.79. I-37- 1-49- 1-43* I-93- The Successive Means of series (i) are— (i) 1.41. I-39- 1.42. I-33- I*33* 1.26. x.25. 1.19. 1.18. T-2 3- whilst those of series (Jc) are- (m) 1.28. 1.28. 1.14. 1.22. 1.27. 1.32. i-38- i-38- I-39- I-37- 1.41. It will be seen that the numbers hi the two series repeatedly fluctuate backwards and forwards, whilst the Means of the first series exhibit an apparently unbroken decrease, and those of the second series an apparently unbroken increase: hence we must assume, first, that disturbing influences, of a short periodic duration, have come into play, whose action has to a great extent been reciprocally equalized amongst the Means; and, secondly, that the first series of Means points to the decreasing portion of a long periodic disturbance, whilst the second series of Means points to the increasing one. Moreover, thirdly, we are led to suspect that the tw o series of obser- vations followed immediately the one on the other, and that the limits of their Means were closely related—that both of them belonged to one and the same period; and, fourthly, to conclude therefrom, that both halves fluctuated within nearly the same limits, and that the sarsa- parilla exercised no share, or at least an inconsiderable one, in the influence on the Means. Let us now examine some other of BoeckeFs researches, especially those which refer to the influence of sugar and alcohol upon the amount of urea in the urine (‘ Contributions to Medical Science/ Crefeld, 1849). The researches on sugar extended over nine days, and gave for the amount of urea in the urine the following figures : 27.8. 19.2. 13.8. 14.9. 17.8. 14.5. 18.5. 16.2. 14.1.

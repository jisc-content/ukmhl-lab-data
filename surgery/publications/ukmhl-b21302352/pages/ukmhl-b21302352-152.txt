ATROPHY OF THE 132 upon motion and sensation, but particularly on the nutrition of the body, is incontestably most important. The influence of the brain and of the spinal cord upon nutrition and the growth of the rest of the body is one of the most difficult subjects of investigation, and it is one upon which a great difference of opinion exists among phy- siologists. It is generally admitted that the so-called vegetative part of the nervous system, or the sympathetic nerve, whose filaments, more or less mingled with the cerebral and spinal nerves, spread through the whole body, exercises a most important influence. It is, however, not so easy to determine what part the brain and spinal cord mediately or immediately contribute to this influence. It has, indeed, been proved beyond ail doubt that long-continued paralysis leads to ema- ciation and atrophy of the paralysed parts; but whether this result is to be considered merely as secondary, and as depending on the con- tinued rest and want of action caused by the paralysis, as most phy- siologists assume, or whether the brain and spinal cord may, by their close connexion with the vegetative portion of the nervous system, contribute more immediately to its production, is still, in my opinion, an undecided problem. It is self-evident that neither vivisections of animals, wrhich much too rapidly result in death, nor the observation of those cerebral lesions, the influence of which on the rest of the body is, on account of their speedy termination, of too short duration, can contribute anything to the solution of this important question. It is only such affections of the brain as are of sufficient extent and duration to manifest the wrant of the action of the organ on the other parts of the system, and still do not destroy life, so that their effects may work long enough upon the bod}r, which are competent to add any light to the subject. That such lesions as interfere with a consider- able portion of the brain while life still continues should be of rare occurrence cannot excite surprise, as usually a slight injury of the cerebrum is sufficient to cause speedy death; the wonder is, on the contrary, that life may last for many years where there is destruc- tion, or at least severe injury, of one half of the organ. Having had an opportunity, a few years ago, of dissecting a body in which nearly one half of the brain wras softened, atrophied, and in a state of morbid degeneration, I thought that an accurate inves- tigation of the evident influence of this cerebral lesion over the rest of the system would be the more important, as in the few instances

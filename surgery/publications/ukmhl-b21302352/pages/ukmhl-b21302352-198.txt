EXPLANATION OE THE PLATES. Eig. I. Base of the skull, the left half of which, A, B, C, is much thicker than the right, D, E, E. a. Strongly arched and thickened left supra-orbital plate of the frontal bone, quite smooth, without a trace of impression of the brain or of waving of the bone. b. Bight supra-orbital plate, with numerous impressiones digitatse. c. Left ala of the sphenoid bone, with a convex, uneven surface sloping towards the base. d. Bight wing of the sphenoid bone, the surface of which is concave, with numerous impressiones digitatse. g. Surface of the petrous bones.—/. Convex, raised surface of the left petrous bone, with a well-marked fissure for a vessel, without any trace of the arching of the semicircular canal, g. Sound petrous bone of the right side, through which the semicircular canal distinctly glimmers. h, i. Situation of the foramen jugulare, covered on both sides by a spine of the petrous bone.—The left, A, is much narrower than the right, i. k, l. Processus clinoidei anteriores.—k. The left, much thicker, more arched, and projecting more backwards than on the right side, causing them to stand obliquely. m, n. Cavities in the occipital bone for the cerebellum.—m. The right depres- sion is much smaller, bounded towards the occipital foramen by a deep groove (the sinus occipitalis inferior), which does not occur on the opposite side The bone is here thicker; behind this depression a new, white, osseous plate is seen in the transverse sinus. . The larger and wider depression for the left lobe of the cerebellum. o. Very well-marked and deep groove for the arteria meningea media. p. Processus clinoidei posteriores. On both sides a new bony lamina runs from the os petrosum towards the clinoid processes, and is separated from them by a transverse suture above p. q. Crista galli, very large and high, quite bent over towards the left side, and there covering the cribriform plate. r. Opening for the dilated left arteria meningea media.

PREFACE. XIV roused by my efforts, shall try to apply the principle of the method of Liston and Garcia in all the most varied direc- tions of which it is capable. Claims of priority can never come into consideration where literary facts speak for themselves ; nevertheless, as they have been raised in a certain quarter, I shall here simply quote the following words of Dr. Locher,1 namely, “That we do not consider him as the inventor, in the real and beautiful sense of the word, who first conceives and partially carries out a new idea, and then lays it aside without even a presentiment of its importance; but him, on the contrary, who first discovers the practical application of the idea (even when it has originated elsewhere), and helps towards its public recognition.” In conclusion, I offer my most hearty and sincere thanks to all those who kindly aided me with their friendly assist- ance in this work.

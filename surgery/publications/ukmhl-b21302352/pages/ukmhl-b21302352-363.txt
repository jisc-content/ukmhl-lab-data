COLD IN SURGERY. 329 It seems to me, above all, desirable to make exact observations on the state of temperature and on the changes in the body during the use of continuous abstraction of heat, in health as well as in disease. For some time past observations have been made in my wards on the changes of temperature which take place in the body after severe injuries or extensive operations, but they have not yet led to results sufficiently positive to serve us as a secure basis on which to attempt to establish the points in question. Those of my colleagues who occupy themselves more with the study of those diseases which fol- low a definite type, and in which the state of temperature has been more closely investigated, might with much more probability of suc- cess turn their attention to these questions, if they should feel in- clined to give a trial to the constant abstraction of heat in the treatment of those forms of disease.

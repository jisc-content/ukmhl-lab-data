10 LARYNGOSCOPE, image, particularly of those regions but little known, and when the parts are moveable; the directions to be given to the individual undergoing examination, to perform certain movements, and to assume the attitude necessary to the most favorable arrangement of the various parts of the mouth and pharynx; in fine, the regulation of the light and of the visual directionâ€”all these circumstances require a degree of practice and dexterity, which can be attained only by great perseverance, conjoined with some preliminary know- ledge and some amount of natural skill. Those circumstances will always be very grave obstacles for the beginner, and will cause those physicians to hesitate in the employ- ment of the laryngoscope, who do not intend to make a speciality of laryngoscopy. Many other methods of examination, however, offer the same difficulties at the commencement, but they do not in the least detract from their value; as an instance I shall here cite the ophthalmoscope, which certain persons only have learned to use with success.

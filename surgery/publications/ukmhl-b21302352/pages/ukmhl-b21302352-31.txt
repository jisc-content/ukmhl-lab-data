13 LIGHT. at which the stem is attached. Thus the mirror ferently either with the right or left hand. Notwithstanding the rigidity of the stem, it can be bent at pleasure, and thus enable us to alter the angle formed between it and the mirror, or even to give a slight curvature (Tig. 2), if it is required for the introduction and support of the mirror. But we may be permitted to make the fol- lowing remark, in conclusion. The success of the examination will depend very much less upon all the foregoing details, concerning the construction of the mirror, than upon the dexterity and skill of the observer. It is easy, with these data, to construct the small laryngeal mirrors everywhere, at a trifling expense.1 Section II.â€”Of the Light. Garcia recommends the illumination of the organs by the aid of the light of the sun, directed upon the mirror introduced into the back part of the mouth of the person under examination. This individual should be placed fronting the sun, so that the observer him- self could turn his back towards it, and allow the rays of light to pass by the side of his head; the visual axis of the observer ought to be as much as possible parallel to the course of the incident rays. But it might so happen that the observer throws a shadow upon the laryngeal mirror, or that he is looking in a direction that is not at all, or scarcely illuminated. 1 These mirrors are made in Paris, according to Mathieu, surgical instrument maker, and by Weiss London. can be used indif- Fig. 2.

43 It is with pleasure that I refer, for one mo- ment, to another matter in which some of you are aware that I have taken great interest^—the endowment of chairs of military surgery in the two other capital cities of the empire. From a reply by Mr. Peel, the Under Secretary-at-War, to a question put to him in the House of Com- mons by Mr. Grogan, the member for Dublin, it would appear that arrangements are making to cany out this measure. In Dublin, a class of military surgery has for several years been in operation, and I trust that the gentleman who has so well conducted it will speedily be com- missioned by the Crown, and put in possession of an endowment. In as far as concerns London, I believe that one great difficulty has been the trouble and expense of removing the Chatham Museum to town, but this I have always looked upon as something very like a bugbear; nor have I ever been able to see why it should be the cause of one hour’s delay. If the mountain cannot be brought to Mahomet, why should not Mahomet go to the mountain ? How often did my late venerable colleague. Professor Jameson, cross the Forth with his pupils to illustrate his geological views by showing them the rocks on the coast of Fife ? How often, and how far.

10 was it less necessary than in the army of the Crimea; never was an army imbued with a better spirit; never were men more reluctant to give in, nor more patient under sufferings and privations. One is entitled to learn wisdom from ex- perience, and I cannot help thinking that, under a recurrence of similar circumstances to those with which the department has had to contend, the services of an assistant-surgeon, or, if you will, an apothecary to the forces, would be well bestowed, in despatching him as a sort of super- cargo with every supply of medical stores, seeing them embarked, knowing where they were stowed, and keeping his eye upon them, until delivered to the authority destined to receive them. Were a cargo of such articles as I have pointed at, with a supply of splints and bandages, despatched successively in different transports, little could be wanting. But, above all, let no selfish, jobbing, or ignorant druggist be permitted to occupy space, and waste the public money, in supplying extract of liquorice (Scottice^ black-sugar), instead of salts and senna. Of the former, I once saw boxes innumerable landing on the beach at Madrasâ€”a very po- tent remedy you will admit for sick soldiers.

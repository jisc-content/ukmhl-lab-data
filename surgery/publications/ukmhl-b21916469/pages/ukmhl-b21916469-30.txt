28 with the diseases of soldiers and seamen, and with those injuries to which they are exposed in the battle-field, and on the ship’s deck? Who will give us the best papers on the medical topography of our many foreign stations, and on the best sites for camps, cantonments, bar- racks, and hospitals at home and abroad? Who, in short, will evince the most perfect knowledge of all the juvantia et laedentia of a military life ? A selection of such papers by an impartial com- mittee, and published by the Government, would give encouragement to the department, and health to the army. With reference once more to this “civil ele- ment,” for which we are indebted to his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, I would observe, that the expression is somewhat indefinite; and as we are not told how far it is to be carried in the re-organization of the medical department, I would say that if this element must be intro- duced into the department, it should be at the bottom, not at the top of the tree. I wonder what civil element actuated Larrey when he killed the spare horses of the officers to make soup for his men. This you will allow was a most uncivil proceeding; but for this, Napoleon made him, on the instant, a Baron of the Empire.

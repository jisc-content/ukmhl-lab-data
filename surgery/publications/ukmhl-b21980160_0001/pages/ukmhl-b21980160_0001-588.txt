53^ ^ Phymojts, Chap. X. when any venereal infedlion fublifts in the eonftitution, the fore produced by this operation, will not readily heal if the pa- tient be not put under a proper mercurial courfe. In fuch circumftances therefore, if mercury has not been previoufly admi- niflered, it ought always to be prefcribed immediately on the operation taking place. In fom'e cafes of phymofis, the prepu- tium is found to be fo very long, that in- Itead of dividing it longitudinally, the operation of circumcifion anfwers the pur- pofe better j and it is very ealily effedled, by taking away fuch a portion as may ap- pear requifite, of the whole circumference of the prepuce. In fuch circumftances, when the prepuce is naturally too long, the removal of a quarter or half an inch of it often frees the patient from what even be- fore the approach of this difeafe he had found to be inconvenient; and as the re- moval of the extremity of the prepuce in general allows the remainder to retradl ea- ftly, the operation is accordingly now and then performed in this manner.

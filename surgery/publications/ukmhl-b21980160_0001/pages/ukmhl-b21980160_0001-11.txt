PREFACE SOME years ago I publifhed a Volume of Obfervations on different parts of Surgery ; and the indulgent reception with which it was favoured, has encouraged me to lay another vo- lume before the Public : This, as well as the former, is intended as part of a work, which, when completed, will form a general Syflem of Modern Surgery. In announcing an undertaking fo arduous and fo extenfive, it may be proper to explain the reafons which induced me to enter upon it, and to point out the plan upon which I intend to pro- ceed. The learned and judicious Helfter publifhed the laft edition of his Syftem of Surgery fo long ago as the year 1739. In this work, the author comprehends whatever the experience of former times had approved as ufeful; and adds fuch ob- fervations as his own knowledge in Anatomy and praftice in Surgery fuggefted. This was the firft, and it ftill remains the only complete Syftem of Surgery of which we are poffefled. ^ 3 Since

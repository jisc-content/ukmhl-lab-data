Ghap-VlIL Of the Varicocele, 497 tumors of a hard fcirrhous nature havd produced it, their extirpation, when that is found to be practicable, will be the moft effectual means that can be employed; and if the tumors have any tendency to fup- purate, warm emollient applications will be more ufeful than any other remedy. But when a general relaxed Bate of the veins is fufpeCted to give rife to the com- plaint, fuch remedies ought to be employed as will moft effectually recover that tone, of which they have been deprived by be- ing long over-diftended. For this purpofe nothing commonly anfwers fo well as the ufe of a proper fufpenfory bandage ; a ho- rizontal poflure; the cold bath ; and the application of a folution of alum and other aflringents, to the parts affeCted. By a due continuation of thefe means every affeCtion of this kind may be always prevented from increafing, and will com- monly be fo far relieved as to renderthe haffh. means by the knife, the cautery, and liga- ture, recommended by ancient writers for the removal of fuch tumors, unneceffary.

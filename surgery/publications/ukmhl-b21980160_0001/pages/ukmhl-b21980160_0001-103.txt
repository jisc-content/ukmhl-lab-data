The fubfe- quent management is the fame here as when the lancet is ufed, and will be pre- fently pointed out. When it is determined to employ the lancet, the form of the inftrument is evi- dently the firft circumflance requiring our attention; although we may here'remark, that this goint is feldom fo particularly attended to as it ought to be. The form of lancet in ordinary ufe, as reprefented in Plate IV. fig. 5. is an inftru- ment which ought to be laid entirely afide.

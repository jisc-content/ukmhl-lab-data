In taking hold of the lancet, "we have di« reaed the fcales to form rather an acute angle with the blade of the inftrument. It will even anfwer when they are at right angles; but a farther feparation proves al- ways troublefome, by throwing the fcales too much back upon the operator’s hand# The length of inftrument left out from between the finger and thumb is another circumftance requiring our attention; for unlefs a fufficient quantity of it is left un- covered, the operator cannot aa with free- dom.

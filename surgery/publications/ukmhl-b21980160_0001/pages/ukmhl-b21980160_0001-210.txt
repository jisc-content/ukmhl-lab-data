The reafon of this lafl; circumftance is obvioufly this; that the blood, by finding a diredt pafiage between the trunk of the artery and the principal branch of the correfponding vein, pafTes more readily in that way, than by the common courfe of circulation along the un<ler part of the member; fo that the quantity of blood fent to the inferior extremities of the artery being thus much diminilhed, the pulfa- tion produced by it muft of courfe become proportionally feeble: But why the fupe- rior part of the artery fliould be enlarged, by the blood paffing thus fo diredlly and eafily from it into the vein, is a circum- ftance not fo eafily accounted for. The refiftance to the blood palfing through the artery, is by this diredl communication between it and the vein very much dimi- niftied; and this has been fuggefted as the caufe of the phenomenon.

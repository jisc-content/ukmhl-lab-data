300 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES A word or two must be said upon what will happen if a septic ligature is used In these cases suppurative inflammation is set up in the neighbour- hood of the ligature, ulceratio.. of the external coat of the artery takes place, and the ligatuTe comes away, after the artery has_ been completely d vided By the t me that this has taken place, the formation of the internal clot^and fhe permanent cicatrix is so far advanced that as a ru e no haemorrhage takes plTce. Should, however, premature separation of the ligature occur, takes Pi'i^^ ^ nrocess extend to the coats of the vessel and they ZS^ItZi^^^^^^ then hemorrhage will result. This will be alluded to again in considering the subject of secondary hcemorrhage. I he average th. e for the separation of the ligature is about a week to ten days, but wHl depend to a great extent on the size of the vessel; in an artery the Seof the subclavian or external iliac, separation may not occur till the sixteenth or eiehteenth day. . „• Befo e finally leaving the subject of ligature of the ar enes in the r condnuit?, it is necessarfto allude to an old-fashioned plan, which has lately Teen rev^Wd, of ligaturing the artery in two places and dividing the vLTel bSween the two l^atures. The object of this is said to be to IfvP more Derfecf rest to the injured vessel. An artery is always in a condit o 'of tTnln, or more or less upon the stretch; and if the artery is tfe n two places, and divided between, the longitudinal strain is emoved The proceeding involves considerably more interference with th?arte y • and except in those cases where too much of the sheath has hPPrSvoidablv separated from the artery, the better plan would appear tobe^resS^to^h?s^^ o relax the vessel and keep it at rest after it has been ligatured. When an a ey is ligatured in its continuity all P-l^-^"" f^^f^^ the vessels below, and the parts supplied by it become cold, blanched, and .umb Shortly however collateral circulation becomes established, and bv means the numerous anastomoses which are normally presen in the boVy blood s carried to the parts below the ligature, the Pulseless eLels beg n to beat again, the part becomes warmer, and the pallor dSppears^ If fi-om any^ause the collateral circulation is not established, the parts supplied by the ligatured vessel die. i,«.morrha^e- Failure in the process of arresting haemorrnage. Failmtin the pj^cess of arresting haemorrhages may give rise to Reactionary HfEmorrhage, Secondary Haemorrhage, or Gangrene. .... ^.-^^^ Reactionarv or intermediate haemorrhage is the bleeding an hicn orrurrdSinrrtie first twenty-four hours after the receipt of an injury or the perfor^^^^^^^^^^^^^ D-'ing immediately after an opera^ tion fpatient is suffering from shock, his heart beats feebly, and the blood proSled with litde force through the vessels ; moreover, the wound is exposed to he air, and this causes the vessels to contract, and t^^^^^^^^^ no bleeding takes place from vessels of even a considerable size they escape the'notice oV the surgeon, and the patient is -t back ^^^^^ bed w 1 thern unsecured.

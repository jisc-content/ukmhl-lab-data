TREPHINING 609 from the depression in front of the external auditory meatus, and the other (f, g, fig. 226) from the posterior border of the mastoid process at its root. A hne drawn from the upper extremity of the posterior perpendicular hne to the point where the fissure of Sylvius crosses the anterior one (see below) would mdicate the position of the fissure of Rolando. The fissure of Sylvius.—The position of the fissure of Sylvius and Its horizontal limb is indicated by a line drawn from a point 1+ inch behind the external angular process to one three-quarters of an inch below the most prominent part of the parietal eminence. The first three-quarters of an inch of this line represents the main fissure, and a line drawn upwards from_ this point represents the vertical portion of the fissure. The parieto-occipital fissure runs outwards at right an<^les to the_sagittal suture, from just in front of the posterior fontanelle, for about an inch. Reid states that if the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius is continued to the sagittal suture, the last inch will indicate with a tair amount of accuracy, the position of the suture ' The lower margin of the cerebrum is indicated by drawing a Imefroni a point half an inch above the external occipital protuberance to a point half an inch above the centre of the external auditory meatus Operation of trephining.—Much of the success which has in recent years attended the operation of trephining is due to the nre- servation of strict asepsis ; the surgeon, therefore, who undertakes these operations should be most careful in carrying out antiseptic treatment in all its details. The head of the patient should be shaved and well scrubbed with soft soap and a brush, rubbed with turpentine or ether, and after being sluiced with strong corrosive sublimate or carbolic acid lotion should, if possible, be covered for twelve hours with a compress of antiseptic gauze wrung out in antiseptic fluid. The best anaesthetic is either chloroform or A.C.E. mixture, as these cause less venous engorge- ment than ether ; and Horsley has recommended a hypodermic injection of morphia before the anaesthetic is commenced, as it tends to cause a contraction of the arterioles of the brain and thus diminish hfemorrhage Where there is no wound, the skull is best exposed by a horseshoe-shaped incision. Most surgeons recommend that the incision should be carried down to the bone, and the pericranium raised with the flaps by means ot a periosteum elevator; but others prefer first to raise the flap from the pericranium, and afterwards this membrane by a crucial incision J^etore the incision is made, the operator must have carefully determined by measurement the position at which he proposes to open the skull and he should mark this spot by driving a bradawl through the skin intJ renhW ' wJ T"' ^'^'"^ ^"'""'^^ introduce the pin of the It nnZ ^ll'^V^^ pericranium is removed, this mark on the bone will at once enable him to proceed with the operation without delay The ^PP^'^^- ^^'"'•ked by the hand is generally saT d'rLl^ K ^^S^ ^"^^"^^^ °f bone have to be removed, a^circular addition fn ^^f^^'-.°-™otor^s sometimes used.

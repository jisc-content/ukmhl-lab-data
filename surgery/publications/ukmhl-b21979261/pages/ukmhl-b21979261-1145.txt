DEFORMITIES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 1107 end of six weeks the fixation apparatus may be abandoned, but the child must be watched for some months, and the exercises continued. Spasmodic wry neck.—This is a condition of tonic or clonic spasm of the muscles of the neck, due probably in most instances to some lesions of the nerve cells from which the nerves supplying the muscles take origin. It is generally unilateral, but may be bilateral. When the spasms are clonic, movements of a rotatory or nodding character are produced ; when tonic, the head is fixed in an abnormal position by the spasmodically contracted muscles. The treatment of these cases should in the first instance be general and medical, consisting in suitable hygienic and tonic measures, and these should be persevered with for some time before anything in the shape of Fig. 411.—Deformity of the hand and foot. (From a cast in the Museum of St. George's Hospital.) operative interference is contemplated. When the sterno-mastoid and trape- zius muscles are most in fault, removal of a portion of the spinal accessory nerve has been resorted to, in some instances with success. This is done by making an incision from the apex of the mastoid process, three inches in length, along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid. The border of the muscle is defined, and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle sought for. The nerve will be found beneath this muscle, about two inches below the apex of the mastoid process. When the short muscles at the back of the neck are involved, it has been proposed to divide the posterior cervical nerves supplying these muscles. As the disease is usually due to some central lesion, both operations are frequently unsuccessful. Deformities of the upper extremity, like deformities elsewhere, may be congenital or acquired.

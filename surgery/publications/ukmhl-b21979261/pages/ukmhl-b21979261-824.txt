786 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS pleural cavity, and by its mechanical pressure on the wounded lung cause the arrest of the htemorrhage. This may succeed sometimes, but is not without its disadvantages and dangers ; for the collection of blood in the pleura may threaten suffocation, under which circumstance the wound- would have to be opened up and the blood allowed to escape. Or, later on this mass of blood in the pleura, unless it is got rid of, will, in most cases undergo putrefaction and cause a very serious condition of things. This 'plan of treating the haemorrhage cannot therefore be recommended. Of recent years it has been proposed to lay the chest wall freely open, and deal with the wound in the lung in a much more thorough manner than has hitherto been attempted. We have, however, very little know- ledge on the subject at present, but it seems probable that in the not far distant future this proceeding may become a recognised plan , of treat- ment and we shall deal with these cases just in the same way as we deal with a laceration of the liver or any other of the abdominal organs. If the patient survive the first two or three days, there is always a danger of pneumonia or pleurisy, or, in most cases, both, being set up. The inflammation in these cases is very different from the localised traumatic inflammation which, as we have seen, occurs in subcutaneous injuries; here bacteria have found an entrance through the external wound, and septic inflammation is the result, with its attendant grave constitutional symptoms. When the lung is involved the physical signs of consohdation may be present-dullness on percussion, fine crepitations, bronchial breathing and bronchophony, and increased vocal fremitus ; but these signs are usually masked by the concomitant inflammation of the pleura, which is attended with eff-usion, and this, mixed with extravasated blood, is a highly putrescible animal matter, to which organisms have been admitted trom without, and it therefore rapidly undergoes putrefaction, and the cavity becomes filled with offensive, stinking pus (empyema). In these cases the constitutional symptoms are most severe, and the patient may die rapidly from absorption of the products of putrefaction. The presence of empyema may be recognised by the patient presenting the physical signs of fluid in the chest (see page 783), conjoined with the history that the signs have not come on for some time after the injury, and are accompamed by severe constitutional symptoms-i.e. high temperature, rigors, a quick pulse, hot skin, and furred tongue. -ui.. ^^imap The treatment consists in providing for the freest possible drainage, by enlarging the original wound and making a counter openuig, necessar), Sd insfrting a lar^e drainage tube.

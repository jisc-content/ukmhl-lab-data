286 INJURIES AND DISKASKS OF SPECIAL 'J'lSSUES Intra-venous injection of a saline fluid yields just as good results as the transfusion of blood; it is much simpler ; does away with the risk of embolism, and therefore should always be preferred. The operation may be performed with a normal saline solution (5j of sodium chloride to one pint of boiled distilled water), or the following solution may be used : Sodium chloride, gr. L; potassium chloride, gr. iii; sodium sulphate and sodium carbonate, of each gr. xxv ; sodium phosphate, gr. ij in a pint of boiled distilled water. The operation must be done with antiseptic pre- cautions. The largest vein at the bend of the patient's elbow is exposed and ligatured at the lower extremity of the incision. It is then seized above the ligature with a pair of fine dissecting forceps, and an oblique cut made into it with a pair of scissors, dividing it about halfway across. By retaining hold of the triangular flap thus made with the forceps, a glass cannula, which should be slightly bent, can easily be introduced into the vein and tied in (fig. 78). To the cannula should be attached a short piece of india-rubber tubing, to the other end of which a funnel is con- nected, into which the fluid can be poured, with the funnel held at a sufficient altitude to insure its admission into the vein (fig. 79). The solution should be of a temperature of 105Â° 1<\ and at least a pint and a half or two pints must be injected. Sometimes a still greater quantity is required, the surgeon being guided by the effect produced and the con- dition of the pulse. Great care must be exercised to prevent the introduc- tion of any air into the vein by filling the tube and cannula with fluid before its introduction.

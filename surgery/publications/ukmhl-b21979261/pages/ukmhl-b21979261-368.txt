INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES 342 digastric muscle is sometimes practised, but it cannot be recommended, as it endangers some of the branches of the facial nerve. . The branches of the external carotid artery sometmies require ligaturing, but the only one which necessitates a separate description is ligature of the lin-ual branch. Ligature of the thyroid arteries _wi 1 be alluded to in connection with operations for removal of the thyroid body. Ligature of the lingual artery has been performed in order to attempt to arrest the growth of cancerous tumours of the tongue by starving them and also before and sometimes after removal of the tongue to control the hemorrhage. The patient's head being turned to the opposite side and the chin raised a semicircular incision is made from a little external to the svmDhvsis of the lower jaw in a curved direction to the apex of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and then upwards and backwards nearly to the an-le of the lower jaw. It should not be carried quite as high as the angle, so as not to wound the facial artery, but should stop just in front of the line of this vessel. The skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia are divided. The submaxillary gland will now be exposed, and is to be hooked upwards with a retractor. A small triangle, bounded by the posterior belly of the digastric above, the hypoglossal nerve below, and the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle in front, is now seen, i he floor of the triangle is formed by the hyoglossus muscle, beneath which is the artery. A director is to be carefully inserted beneath the muscle and ks fibres divided, or they may be scratched through with the point of Se knife, care being taken to avoid wounding the ingual vem, which geneSly lies on the muscle. Upon dividing the muscle fe -gual artery will be found running parallel to the upper border of the hyoid bone J" passing the aneurism needle care must be taken not to perforate the fibres Srthe middle constrictor of the pharynx, on which the artery lies and ^ which and the mucous membrane it is separated from the phaiyngeal '''''''orbital aneurism.-Under the term a««.m;« are included several different conditions which give rise to a P^^f "Jf ' orbit. These cases are classed together on account of their Present ng very similar clinical characters, though the pathological changes .Inch have given rise to them are very diverse. Among the conditions thich hive been found after death in cases of orbital aneurism are the following : Aneurism of the ophthalmic artery wi hin the oibit, m one ca e onfy - aneurism of the Ophthalmic artery withm the cranmm a d outside the orbit; aneurysmal varix, ^rmed by a conm^umcaUon or internal carotid artery with the cavernous sinus ; rupture Jon carotid artery into the sinus ; thrombosis of the cavernous smus, compi essio or obliteration of the ophthalmic veins by old inflammatory products. In addition to these, cases'of pulsating tumour of the orbit ^a- oc-^^^^^^^^^^ which after death no arterial disease was found. Rivmgton, ^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ most exhaustive paper on the subject ^ believes that m ^ases of con^^^^^^^^^ origin the symptoms may be produced by cirsoid aneu..sm of he artm^^^^^^ the orbit, though this condition has never been demonstrated by post-moitem "'"''^LTcauses of this condition are in many cases obscure. In those collected by Rivington more than one half were attributable to injury, > Guthrie's case, in which an aneunsm was found on the ophthdmic artery on both sides.

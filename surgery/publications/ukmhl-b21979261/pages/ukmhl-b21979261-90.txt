64 GENERAL INJURIES b. The interrupted suture consists in introducing a single suture, tying the ends, cutting the material close to the knot, and then introducing a second, and so on until the whole length of the wound has been sutured (fig. 12, a). The main objections to this plan are the length of time it occupies in carrying out, and the less accurate adjustment of the edges which it entails. c. The twisted suture is chiefly used in wounds of the lip, as in the operation for hare-lip or after removal of a portion of the lip for cancer. A steel pin is passed through the two edges of the wound, and whilst they are held in contact a piece of silk is twisted in a figure of 8 fashion under the pins and across the wound (fig. 13). In this way two, three, or more pins may be inserted. The object aimed at by this mode of Fig. 13.—The twisted suture, as suture is to diminish tension; and, in applied in a case of hare-lip. operations on the lip, to compress the divided coronary artery and to arrest the hfemorrhage from it. They should always be removed at the end of forty-eight hours. d. The quilled suture is used where the deeper parts of deep wounds require to be brought into apposition. They are almost exclusively Fig. 14.—The quilled suture, as applied in a case of ruptured perineum. employed in the operation for ruptured perineum. For its performance a long, strongly curved needle on a handle is required. This, armed with a strong and long piece of silk, is introduced through the skin some distance from the margin of the wound and carried to its lowest level, then across

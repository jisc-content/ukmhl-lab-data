MICROCEPHALY ing appears to be to divide the skull from the middle line in front to a little distance from the middle line behind on one side, and in ten days or a fortnight to repeat the operation on the other; so that the two incisions meet in front, but behind leave a small portion of bone undivided, which acts as a hinge. A part of the skull cap can then be raised from the brain. The operation is, however, one of very doubtful utility. Temporary im- provement as regards the rigidity has been noted in some cases, but no great amount of improvement in the intelligence has been recorded in most of the cases operated upon.

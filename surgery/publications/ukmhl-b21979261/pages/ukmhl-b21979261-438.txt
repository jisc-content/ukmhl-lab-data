412 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES There has been little injury to the soft parts around, and therefore the uiflammation IS confined to the bone and an inflammatory effusion is pou ed out between the broken ends and here alone (fic i-^i a) Thi« n.ti the various changes enumerated above, and Le'com^i' cLe ted "to'w and remains as the permanent bond of union. It is termed ^X/Z^canus' In some of these cases probably a little inflammatory efTusStki plac^^ in o he medul ary canal, but if so it is subsequently absorbed and the canal reopened, so that m the course of time the condition of the bone is so entirely restored that it is mipossible to indicate the original site of the fracture. Secondly, in those cases where the fracture if more or less oblique, and where therefore it is impossible to maintain such accu ate apposition, and where there has been a greater or less amount of displace^ ment and corresponding injury to the soft parts, and especially whem an 131—Diagram showing the different ways in which fractures unite, a bv definitive caUus alone ; B, by ensheathing callus ; c, by ensheathing callus filling up the intervals between displaced bones ; D, by interposed callus absolute immobility of the limb is not preserved, there is inflammation not only in the ends of the bone, but in the tissues around, so that the amount of inflammatory effusion is greater, and takes place not only between the broken surfaces, but also to a considerable extent around the fractured ends, both externally where it is called ens/iea^/zmg callus, and also internally mto the medullary canal, where it is called w/erna/ callus (fig. 1^51, b) The ensheathing and internal callus are together termed provisima/callus, since they are only temporary and are thrown out rapidly in order to support the fracture and maintain the ends in apposition, while the definitive callus IS niore slowly soldering the broken ends together. The subsequent changes m the inflammatory exudation are the same, the only difference being that in the provisional callus the changes take place more rapidly

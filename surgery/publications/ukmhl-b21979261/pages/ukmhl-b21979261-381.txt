LIGATURE OP THE COMMON ILIAC 355 the vein to the inner side and the genito-crural nerve, which Hes on the sheath. Sir Astley Cooper's method.—In this operation the incision IS m-^de in a curved direction from a little above and outside the ex- ternal abdominal ring, and carried downwards and outwards to the level of Poupart s ligament, and from this upwards and outwards to about an inch and a halt from the inner side of the anterior superior spinous process ot the ilium. This incision lays bare the aponeurosis of the external oblique, which is divided. This exposes the inguinal canal with the sper- matic cord, surrounded by the cremaster muscle. The cord with the arched fibres of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles are to be drawn up\rards with a hook retractor, and the transversalis fascia will be exposed. The fascia is next torn through with a director and forceps and the artery will be felt pulsating. By clearing away a little loose areolar tissue the lower part of the artery may be exposed, its sheath opened,^and the ligature passed from within outwards about an inch above roupart s ligament, so as not to place it too close to the origins of the deep epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries. Care must be taken to avoid wounding the deep epigastric artery, which lies on the inner side of the wound between the transversalis fascia and the peritoneum : or the circum- flex ihac vein, which crosses the artery a little above Poupart's ligament I he genital branch of the genito-crural nerve which lies on the artery must also be avoided. ■' The relative advantages and disadvantages of these two operations would appear to be as follows : Sir Astley Cooper's interferes with the peri- sTri/nhll rK'^fT''^?'ii '''' its performance, and, it is said, IS less liable to be followed by ventral hernia; it possesses, however this serious disadvantage, that a ligature can be applied to only the lower part of the artery, whereas by means of Abernethy's operation the vessel can be tied at any part of its course, or, if it should be judged necessary, by pro- longuTg the incision upwards the common iliac artery can be tied • .1. f!'^^®''!*®''?*^ operation.-It would seem probable hat m the future when the surgeon has occasion to ligature the ex ternal ihac artery he will select the transperitoneal route, for the easons above enumerated. Certainly this should be done in those casL where ^^^^^th^^he will have to tie the external or common i iTc for though the common Ihac may be tied by an extension of Aberne hy's operation for the external iliac the operation is one of great difficuky and IS attended by many risks of accident, such as ligaturing the ureter w h ti e artery; injuring the vas deferens; wounding the deep''epigastric or crcum flex Ihac artery or vein, and, in addition to this, the risk of cellulkis be n. set up from the injury necessarily done to the subserous areolar t^ ue ^ The operation is very easily performed by an incision in he semi- lunar line, which divides all the structures in the abdominil wall and opens the peritoneal cavity.

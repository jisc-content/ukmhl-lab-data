Treatment.—No very definite rules can be laid down for the treatment of this condi- tion, nor indeed in the majority of cases is any treatment necessary. As we have said„j it is merely the curative process of chronic ostitis, and as such must be looked upon as a permanent condition. When it occurs in a syphilitic subject, as it most frequently dees the administration of mercury and iodide ot potassium is Indicated, especially if pain is complained of. This will probably prevent any extension of the disease, but will have little or no effect on the enlargement which has already taken place. In some cases the pain is much more severe, and rehef may be afforded to it by drilling the sclerosed bone in different situations. -i. Abscess in bone.-By the term adscess in bom is meant a circumscribed collection of pus, which is sometimes found in the cancellous tissue of the ends of the long bones (fig. 166), more especially of the tibia,' though other bones, as the femur, humerus radius and ulna, are sometimes affected Pathology.—The condition is probably always "tuberculous in its nature.

Artificial anus is produced in those cases where there has been con- siderable destruction of the gut, as in a case of strangulated hernia, where the herniated portion of the gut has sloughed and the margins of the living gut arouna become adherent to the external wouna. In these cases an eperon or spur is formed, and on looking into the opening two tubes are seen, separated from eacn other by a partition, so as to present the appearance of the muzzle of a double- barrelled gun (fig. 328). Of these tubes the lower one-that is to say, the one connected with the portion of bowel belo^^s the opening-is generally smaller ha^i the upper.

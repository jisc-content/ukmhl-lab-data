Still holding the margin of the opening in the sheath in the forceps, the aneurism needle is now to be passed from without inwards, and having been threaded with the ligature is to be withdrawn. The artery is thus encircled by the ligature, but before it is tied the vessel should be raised slightly by tensmg the loop in order to see • whether the pulsation in the artery beyond the hga- ture is commanded, and to satisfy the surgeon that he has not included any other structure.

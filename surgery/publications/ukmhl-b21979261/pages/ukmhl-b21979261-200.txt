174 GENERAL DISEASES Treatment.â€”The treatment of pyEemia is mainly prophylactic. By careful asepticism and free drainage, pyaamia has been practically banished from British surgery. This, with pure air and avoidance of overcrowding, and care in preventing the contamination of one wound from another, ought to render pysemia one of the most uncommon of diseases, and exclude it almost entirely from our hospital wards. When pytemia has set in little can be done in acute cases. The only plan of treatment is to support the patient's strength by a stimulating and tonic plan of treatment, and treat symptoms as they arise. Quinine in large doses is the remedy on which the greatest reliance is to be placed. This, with such fluid nourishment as the patient can take, a liberal allow- ance of wine or brandy, and strict attention to hygienic measures, sums up the treatment. In the more chronic form of the disease the .same measures are to be adopted, with, in addition, incision of abscesses as soon as they form. In this class of cases the abscesses more frequently occur in accessible situations, and are therefore more under the control of the surgeon. Of course, in the acute form of the disease, if secondary abscesses occur in any situation where they can be reached, they should be opened, but this is rarely the case. They must in every instance be opened with antiseptic precautions. Sir James Paget points out that in the chronic cases the removal by operation of the seat of the original disease is frequently of the greatest benefit, and this should always, if possible, be done. By adopting this plan of treatment cases of chronic pyaemia occasionally recover, but in many of these cases the recovery is far from complete, and the patients often succumb some time afterwards from some such diseases as albuminuria or phthisis,

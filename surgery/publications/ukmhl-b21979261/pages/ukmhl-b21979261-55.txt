Co/d packing is another means which is sometimes employed to lower the temperature in some febrile conditions, but is more frequently employed by the physician than the surgeon. The application of heat to an inflamed part is another means of relieving congestion which is constantly resorted to. This it appears to do in a twofold man- ner. In the first place it increases the flow of blood through the part to which it is applied, and in this way acts in the opposite direction to cold, and not only tends to empty the vessels,^ but Fig. 5.—Letter's tube as applied to the head. r ^^i^Sy^ S:tSc;S products which are accumt.a^ in then. Secondly, heat would appear to have some influence on the nerves ot he part, lessening their sensibility, and thus leading to a diminution in the pain.

The salt retains its heat for a very considerable time, and there fore does not require very frequent renewal. Heat may also be a plied by passing hot water through a Leiter's tube ; the water being kept a ^l e required temperature by placing a lamp or gas jet under the re^tacle m which the water is placed.

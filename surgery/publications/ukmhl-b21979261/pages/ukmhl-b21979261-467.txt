It is for the most part transverse, but may be slightly oblique. It is usually non-impacted, but very occa- sionally impaction may occur, the neck being driven into the loose cancellous tissue of the head. This fracture is an injury of ad- vanced life, being rarely met with in • , r 1 r'ons u der fifty^ears of age, and is much more common m the fema e fhan the male. It is always the result of indirect violence, and usually results from some trivial accident producing a wrench or strain, as catching the toe in some inequality in the ground, which causes_ the patien to stumble and the bone to give way. The reason it occurs in old people is no doubt due to degenerative changes in the cancellous tissue and the absorpdon of the ' calcar femorale,' which, according to Merkel sustain the greatest amount of pressure when the body is in the erect position. I is sometimes said that the angle between the neck and the shaft is lessened as ace advances, and that this is a cause of the frequency of fracture in old ate but it is vWy doubtful if this is so. The greater frequency of its occurrence in females is due to the greater width of the pelvis in this sex. Fig. 150.—Diagram showing the more common fractures of the upper end of the femur.

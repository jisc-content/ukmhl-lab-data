The cartilages are more resistmg, so that it frequently happens in examuimg the spine in a case in which an aneurism has been pressing upon it that the bones will be found to be exten- sively absorbed, while the intervertebral discs stand out between the eroded vertebra almost unaltered. Muscles and fascia are thinned, and then absorbed, or may become more or less blended vnth the con- densed tissue around the sac. Glands and their ducts when pressed upon may have their functions impaired, or the passage of their secretion arrested and respiration or deglutition may be impeded by pressure on the trachea or cesophagus Siffus of external aneurism.—The first ana essential sign is the presence of a tumour in the course of a large artery. The tumour may varj^ m size but it is always circumscribed, is usually g'obularin shape, and is A^ed to the artery, rom which it springs, and from which it cannot be moved. It varies in its consistence: when super- „ ft and containing little laminated fibrin it is soft ..o ;^~is. and compressible, and may fluctuate when mo e o the posterior tibial deeply seated or contaming moie ^Jot, it is hrmer • and more sohd to the touch.

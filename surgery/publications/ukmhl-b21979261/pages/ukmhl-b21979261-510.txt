484 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES Treatment.—No treatment which has been adopted has appeared to have any influence on the progress of the disease. Acromegaly is a rare affection, which was first described by Pierre Marie in 1885 It is mainly characterised by an enlargement of the hands, feet, and face, but is a general affection involving also other parts of the The Sgement is usually confined to the bones of the face the bones of the cranium being rarely affected, with the exception of the lower part ot the cranmm oem^ ra y ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ margins of the orbit. The bones of the face which show the most marked enlargement are the lower jaw and the nasal bones. The enlargement is apparently a mere overgrowth or hypertrophy of the bones, for on microscopic examination they pre- sent the structure of normal bone. Etiology.—Nothing is known as to the causation of this disease. It occurs in both sexes, and gene- rally appears between the ages of 20 and 30, but its advent is so insidious that no definite history can usually be obtained as to the exact time at which the disease made its appear- ance, the first thing noticed being the alteration in the appearance of the patient. Symptoms.—The change in the face is the most striking feature. The appearance is dull, heavy, and coarse, and the face assumes the shape of an elongated oval, the eyebrows are prominent and overhanging, the nose enlarged and the chin elongated. The soft , parts of the face, and especially the Fig. 172.—Acromegaly.

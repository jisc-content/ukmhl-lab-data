642 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS Svnhilitic lip—Occasionally, in the tertiary stage of syphilis, the lower lip is the seat of a diffuse thickening, and becomes enlarged and hard The case must be treated with iodide of potassium. Superficial ulcerations on the inner surfaces of the hps are common in dyspeptic people. They are very pamful when touched. They ca usually be ^ufed by the application of a pomt of lunar caustic. Cracks and fissures in the lips are also common, and are often due to exposure to cold When neglected, they form deep and painfu fissures, which are prone to bleed and difficult to heal. The favourite site is the middle line Sf the lower lip. They must not be mistaken for the fissures at the angle o the mouth in congenital syphilis. They can generally be cured by the appUcatL. of nitrate of silver, but if they become persistent and chronic it may be necessary to remove the indurated margin before healing will take place Herpes frequently attacks the hps as the result of catarrh and also in febrile conditions. It also often occurs during the cours-e of pneumonia. The lip becomes painful and swollen, and this is followed by a crop of vesicles surrounded by a red inflammatory zone. The vesicles become pustular, burst, and leave small scabs, which soon separate. N o spedal tr^eatment beyond the application of a little lanolin is required Cysts are common in the lips, due to obstruction of the mucous foUic es. They are small transparent thin-walled cavities containing a glairy d The only treatment is excision of the whole o the sac wall, any pa lal operation, such as removal of a portion of the wall, ^emg frequency followed bv recurrence. The Hps are very frequently the seat of nsevus. i he treatment var es with the extent of the growth. When small and situated oirdae marg n oT the lip, they may be cured by the application of nitric acid or ethllate of sodium ; when they involve the whole thickness of a Sail po'^ol of the lip, they may be excised by ^ ^-shaped incisi^^^ the edees united ; but when, as is usually the case, they involve a consider able portion of he lip, th^y are best treated by repeated apphcations of th gSno cautery. Sccasfonally they are found as culated growths, and it may then be possible to cure them by hgatunng g'atbuncle of the lip.-The so-called f"-'-^/Z'l'tostT^l always occurs on the lips, generally of young men and is a mos^ fatal disease.

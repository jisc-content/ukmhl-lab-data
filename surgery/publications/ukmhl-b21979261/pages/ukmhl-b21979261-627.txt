MENINGITIS AND ENCEPHALITIS 601 or nose with sharp-pointed instruments, as a knife or pair of scissors or with blunt mstruments, as a stick or umbrella ; and finally by bullets in gunshot wounds. Symptoms.—The local signs are sufficiently obvious : there is a wound at the bottom of which the dura mater can be seen to be injured, and from' which in many cases brain matter may be escaping. The general symptoms may be very slight, for there may be a severe injury to the brain especially to the frontal lobes, and still the patient may be perfectly con- scious. The bleeding which takes place in a considerable majority of cases can escape by the wound, and therefore does not exert any pressure on the brain substance, except in those cases where the ventricles have been opened and the bleeding takes place into them; or in others where the bleeding takes place into the substance of the brain from not being able to find an exit through the external wound. Under these circumstances fatal compression would ensue. In some instances, especi- ally in gunshot wounds, sudden death may occur : the explanation of this phenomenon depends upon what is called the hydrodvtiamic effect oi the bullet, and IS due to the momentum of the missile being transferred to the molecules of the brain substance, and causing waves of increased pressure, which reach the base of the brain, and cause arrest of the respiration by the effect they produce on the medulla The great danger of wounds of the brain is septic meningo-encephalitis which will be described immediately. If the wound is rendered and maintamed aseptic, probably there is less danger than from a laceration of the brain without wound, since the dangers of compression from effused the wound ''^^ (^^Qm^ are lessened by the escape of blood from Treatment.—In all cases of compound fracture of the skull in which .ho.inT °' T "^f ^branes have been injured, a thorough exploration should be made, unless the patient is obviously sinking from the injury 1 he hair should be cut away from around the wound; indeed, in rnost cases it IS better to shave the whole head, and the scalp should be cleaned and rendered aseptic. The wounded part should be then explored if necessary by enlarging the wound and removing bone with the trephine or re2n.lT' Tf^f ^ depressed bone must be elevated, and any loose fragments removed.

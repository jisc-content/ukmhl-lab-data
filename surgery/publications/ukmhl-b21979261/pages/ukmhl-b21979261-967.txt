RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER 3 o 929 Treatment.—If a rupture of the ureter is diagnosed immediately after the mjury, the treatment would be to cut down upon it and suture it • but usually the diagnosis is not made until too late for this. If a tumour has appeared, a tree mcision should be made in the lumbar region the fluid evacuated and the cavity drained. An attempt should be made to hnd the injured ureter, and if it is completely torn across it should be sutured; if it cannot be found, a permanent fistula will be left If it has not been conipletely torn across, the opening in it may eventually close It disorganising changes have taken place in the kidney, it will necessitate nephrectomy. The ureter may be accidentally wounded in some abdominal operations such as ovariotomy, hysterectomy, and the removal of suppurating tubes and ovaries or in operations for extra-uterine fcetation. If this should happen, and the surgeon detect the injury at the time, an attempt should be made to restore the continuity of the canal by inserting very fine silk sutures after Lembert's method, and then covering the injured part with peritoneum. If the ureter is completely divided, an end-to-end anasto Tnf: K^^ i'Y^;g"^f ?"g the upper into the lower end; or a lateral anasto- mosis, by a lateral implantation of the upper end into an opening in the side of the lower end, must be attempted. Failing this, the upper end should be implanted into the bladder or the intestine Rupture of the bladder.-Rupture of the bladder is a formid- able injury, which occurs in both sexes, but is more common in the male It generally arises from a direct blow upon, or crushing force applied to, the ower part of the abdomen when the bladder is full, but has been known to be produced by violent blows on the back under similar circumstances Subcu aneous laceration of the bladder may also be caused by fractures of nf Ki' ^ fragment perforating the bladder, or by a tearing o the bladder in cases of fracture without any perforation.

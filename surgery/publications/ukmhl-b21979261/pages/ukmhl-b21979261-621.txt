COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN 595 insensible condition, under the supposition tliatheis drunk, but retain him tor a tew hours, when the return of consciousness will usually settle the ques- tion If the msensibility arise from uremic or diabetic coma, its existence in the absence of any history of chronic renal disease, may be established by drawing off and examining the urine. The insensibility of narcotic poisoning niay be suspected from the pin-point pupils, and lividity of the face ; the insensibility from sunstroke or exposure to cold by the state of the weather, and the circumstances under which the patient was found i here only remains then to distinguish these cases from apoplexy, and this IS not easy It can only be done by excluding other causes, and by the fact that the face of the drunkard is flushed and turgid. The age of the patient should also be considered, late life being favourable to brain disease. But after all it is often impossible to diagnose between these two conditions, and the only true test is the test of time I. Compression from depressed fracture.—When the sym- ptoms of compression come on immediately after the receipt of the accident he cause of the conipression is either depressed fracture or a foreign body,' and to distinguish between the two causes is not as a rule difficult The tn J^ff . f uT """"^ examination of the wound will generally suffice to differenuate between the two conditions. Of course, if there is no wound here can be no foreign body, and in these cases it is sometimes difficult to SonH depressed bone through the mass of bruised tissue and extravasated blood. If there is the slightest doubt in the surgeon's mind, he should never hesitate to niake an incision in order to settle the que tion. The treatment has already been alluded to; that is, whether the fracture is simple or compound, to expose and elevate the depressed bone blood ,^°™P^®ssion from extraYasation of blood.-Effusion of blood is a very common cause of compression of the brain. The blood may be effused in several situations, (a) Between the bone and the dura Jhfdur^mT"r\'^"°"'^^1- u -^f^^^ °f the brain beneath effLed eiZr '""''."r^f ^ haemorrhage).

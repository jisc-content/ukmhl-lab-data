Under an anaesthetic they may be incised and their contents turned out with a small spoon. Polypi are also common in the meatus but they usually have their seat further inwards, and will be spoken of in the sequel. Exostoses are usually described as of two varieties • (i) the true exostosis, which is a single circumscribed bony tumour growing from the wall of the meatus; and (2) multiple enlargements of the canal, due to inflammatory periosteal formations. They are generally confined to one ear and are for the most part due to some local cause, as the repeated irritation produced by a chronic otorrhcea, or from constant bathin^ in salt water. They are, however, sometimes congenital, and are also said to be common in gouty subjects. When they completely block the canal they produce deafness ; but this infirmity in these cases is more often due to retained secretion which cannot find an escape on account of the growth and if this is removed periodically, the hearing is restored and no further treatment is advisable. But in those cases where the deafness is great, and especially where it is bilateral, or in those other cases where there is a perforation of the membrana tympani and the discharge cannot escape, it becomes necessary to remove the growth. This is best done by boring a hole through the base of the tumour by means of a drill and dental engine, and gradually, by increasing the size of the drill, grinding the growth away The operation requires care and precision but in the practised hand is not attended by much risk. AFFECTIONS OF THE MIDDLE EAR Method of examination.-For examining the membrana tympani or tympanum from the meatus, the speculum is used (seepage 680 The points to be observed in examining the membrane are ifs opacity its colour, and its vascularity; whether it is concave or bulging, and whethe there is any perforation. When the membrane is completly or largely destroyed, the pink inner wall of the tympanum can be seen and possibly cZ.

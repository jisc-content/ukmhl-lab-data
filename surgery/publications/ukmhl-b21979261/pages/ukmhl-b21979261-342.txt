Inflammation of U fcoatVof an artery exposed in an abscess cavity may lead to aneunsm This i occasionally seen in vomica of the lung, and by some is believed to £ due to be loL of support occasioned by absorption of the surround- L tissues but is more probably due to inflammatory changes set up in 1^1 S of the vessels as a consequence o direct extension from the the waus o ne around, which weakens them and causes them ;f vTirrd r" hein™ pressure.

Causes which increase blood pressure.— The most common cause of increased blood pressure in relation to the etiology of aneurism is greatly increased action of the heart, of an occasional or intermittent character It is probable that increased action of the heart which is continuously brought about is not nearly so potent a cause of aneurism as inter- mittent strain, for we find aneurisms are very common in soldiers and sailors, who are occa^ sionally called upon to make sudden and unwonted exertion, and in people in better circumstances, who most of the year live a sedentary life and then indulge in active exer- tion, mountaineering, &c., and so put a sudden strain on their circulation ; whfle aneurism is not common in labouring men, who are con- stantly employed in steady, laborious occupa: tions and whose heart and vessels accommodate ^ themselves to it. Other causes which increase Fig. 92.-An aorta showing blood pressure, such as plethora, or the increasea several aneurisms in different ^^^^^[^\ tension accompanying arterio-capUiary fibrosis, also act as causes of aneunsrn. Predisposing causes.-(i) Age Aneurisms are most common at that age when the coa s of the arteries are beginning to undergo senile changes and are thus weakened, ^^;hlle the muscular system is still vigorous and the individual engaged J^^ nursuks (2) Sex. Aneurism is much more common in the ".ale than the female and this is what one would naturally expect, smce actne muscular exercise predispose to the disease.

784 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS times-this may be so abundant as to cause death in a short time, but in the generality of cases it ceases in the course of twenty-four hours. Inflammation of the lung and pleura follows wound of the lung; but when the wound is subcutaneous, as in those cases which we have'just been considering, the inflammation is generally local and shows no tendency to spread beyond the injured parts. This is because, though air is admitted to the wound, it is filtered before it reaches the injured tissues, and therefore contains no septic germs to set up an infective inflammation. It has been abundantly proved by Tyndall and others that all foreign particles which are introduced into the air passages with the air we breathe, are arrested in the larger bronchial tubes, and that therefore the air which enters the air cells is pure and contains no sources of contamination. Even in cases where the pleura is injured and blood accumulates in large quantities in the pleural cavity, suppuration rarely takes place, for the simple reason that there are no pyogenic micrococci to excite it. The blood is absorbed, or in some cases, acting as a framework, it causes adhesion of the two layers of the pleura to take place, by a process analogous to union of wounds by blood clot (see page 56). There is necessarily a localised traumatic inflammation about the injury in the lung, set up for the process of repair. The inflammatory exudation fills the air vesicles, and thus causes a consolidation of the lung by scar tissue at the injured^ot^^^^ of the lung with external wound.-These cases are very much more serious than those of subcutaneous wound from a fractured rib, as unfiltered air is admitted from without, and there is danger from septic inflamma- tion. They may be produced by stabs from sharp cutting in- struments; wounds from blunt bodies, as where a man has been struck on the chest from the shaft of a carriage in motion ; or from gunshot wounds (fig. 301). These latter are probably the most severe, because they are often of great depth and may be complicated by the lodgment in the lung of particles of clothing, pieces of bone, or the bullet itself A penetrating wound of the lung is recognised by the presence of an external wound, through which air is drawn in and out during respiration, often with a whisthng or bubbling sound (traumatopnoea), with other signs Fig. 301.—Gunshot wound of the king.

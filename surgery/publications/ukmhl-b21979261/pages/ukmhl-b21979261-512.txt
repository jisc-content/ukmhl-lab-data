INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES TUMOURS OF BONE The principal tumours of bone are: (i) exostoses, (2) chondromata, (.) fibromata, (4) sarcomata, (5) carcinomata (6) cystic tunaours Ol hese the exostoses, the chondromata, and the fibromata have been dealt with elsewhere and it remains therefore only to discuss the last three. Sarcoma is a malignant tumour, and is the most important primar>' tumour of bone, for all p-mary malignant tumours of bone belong to one of the varieties of sarc3ma. The structure of these tumours has already been described (page 243), and it is therefore only requisite in this place ^0 aUuc to t^^ doing this it is necessary to divide- hen into two groups, the J>enp/ieraUnd centra/, for it will be ound that there are the most important clinical distinctions between these two classes 'central or endosteal sarcoma (fig. 73)--The central sarcomata, as their name implies, start in the medullary tissue and gradually expand the bone within which they grow. This expansion is brought about by new bone being formed on the surface by the irri- tated periosteum, while the old bone is gradually destroyed and replaced by the tumour as it grows, so that it cannot be said that the bone really expands in the sense of the true meaning of the word.

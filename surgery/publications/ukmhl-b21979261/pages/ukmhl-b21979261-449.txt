If, however, there is considerable overlapp "g of the fragments, and thus the ends are widely separated from each otncr and especially if the bone is deeply placed and difficult to Sf f' ^ is probably wiser to peg the bones together in their faulty posit on rathe than to attempt to bring them into place ; a proceeding which is often almos impossible without cutting away a very considerable^ amount of bone on account of the shortening which has taken place m the muscular and ■fibrous structures. The simplest way of pegging them together is by means of a steel drill which is driven through both fragments and allowed to re- main in situ with the end sticking out of the external wound until umon between the bones has taken place, when it is withdrawn. It is in most instances desirable to insert two drills, and they are usually to be left in for three or four weeks or it may be longer. Vicious union.—Union of a fracture is sometimes accompanied by considerable deformity, and this may impair movement and render the limb more or less useless. This may arise from several different causes : (i) A fracture may be badly set, either from want of care and attention on the part of the surgeon, or from his inability to overcome the deformity, 01 from the amount of swelling preventing him from accurately determining the position of the fragments. (2) A fracture may be properly set, and subsequently the bones may slip out of position. (3) The callus may be still soft and imperfectly ossified when the limb is taken out of the splints, and gradually yields under the weight of the body. If the displacement is angular and the deformity is discovered during the first three or four weeks after the fracture, while it is still recent, the patient should be placed under an anesthetic and the bone forcibly straightened and, if necessary, refrac- tured. If the deformity is longitudinal, that is to say, the one fragment overlapping the other, no justifiable force will probably be able to over- come it. When the deformity has existed for a longer period and the bones are firmly welded together in their abnormal position, an endeavour may be made by a cutting operation to remedy the deformity, or subcutaneous refracture may be performed by means of an osteoclast. This latter mode of proceeding is advocated by some surgeons, and in cases of angular deformity has appeared to have been successful in their hands, and not to have been attended with any great amount of injury of the soft parts. But a cutting operation either by subcutaneous osteotomy or by taking a wedge- shaped piece out of the convexity of the deformity appears to be the better proceeding, because it can be carried out with more exactness and probably without any greater ri,sk to the patient.

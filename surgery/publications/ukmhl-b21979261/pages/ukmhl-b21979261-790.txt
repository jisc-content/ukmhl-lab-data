754 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS Hospital.) movements of the intestine are not suspended the sympathetic which ^DplSs their muscular coat communicating with the cord at a higher level • when the fracture is higher up, the peristaltic motion is stopped and he feces become arrested in the intestine. Owmg to the loss of trophic ■mkuence in the rectum a low form of proctitis is liable to be set up, with he oassaee of tarry, liquid stools. The functions of the bladder are terfered with; if the injury to the cord is above the micturition centre he patient is ^ible to expel his urine and does so by a reflex act and unconsciously, but if the micturition centre is involved in the injury the bladder ^paralysed, the urine is retained and then overflows Priapism ^ slt JLTs pL^-^^-^^^ is often excited by the passage of a catheter ^l.e Later symptoms of fracture are due to a low form of inflammation of the Sadde and bedsore, and a fatal issue often ensues from toxaemia following septic cystitis or sloughing of the nates. The intellect is unaffected, and the patient is usually free from pain. The prognosis depends upon the amount of injury which the cord has receded and the situation where the injury has takei. place. Where the receivcu auu paralysis and loss of sensation are absolute and persistent, and where therefore presumably the cord has been totally disintegrated, death in the great majority of cases occurs sooner or later; though cases have been recorded where there has been complete paralysis and loss of sen- sation from fracture in the dorsal and even the cervical region, and still the patients have lived for years (fig. 288). In cases of fracture in the dorsi-lumbar region this is not uncommon, but even in these cases death usually occurs eventually from some cause connected with the injury, as, for example, septic p)^lo- nephritis set up by cystitis. The higher the fracture is, in most cases, the earlier does death occur. Treatment.—The immediate treatment of a case of fracture- dislocation where the cord is crushea consists in rallying the patien from his collapse, and if thought desirable making an attempt to re- duce the displacement.

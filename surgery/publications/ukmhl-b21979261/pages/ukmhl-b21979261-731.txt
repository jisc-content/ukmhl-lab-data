AUDITORY VERTIGO 695 heads of (i) nerve deafness, (2) tinnitus, and (3) auditory vertigo, with which may be associated nausea and vomiting. I. Nerve deafness.—Loss of hearing from involvement of the audi- tory nerve may be recognised from loss of hearing due to damage of the conducting media by the tuning fork (see page 688). It may arise (i) from general diseases of the system, of which syphilis, either acquired or congeni- tal, IS by far the most common ; but it may follow on one of the exanthe- mata, or mumps, or from anaemia : (2) from intra-cranial mischief, such as aneurism of the basilar or auditory artery, or tumours, abscesses, orhtemor- rhage (3) from disease of the middle ear, generally by causing caries or necrosis of the labyrinth, but sometimes indirectly by causing reflex vaso- motor changes in this part: (4) from the long-continued use of certain drugs such as quimne or salicin : (5) from sudden loud and unexpected noises, as the discharge of artillery. The treatment depends in a great measure on the cause. In the syphilitic cases, antisyphilitic remedies; in the anaemic cases, preparations ot iron and so on, should be employed, but many of these cases are not amenable to treatment. Meniere's disease.—In connection with nerve deafness, allusion • must be made to a peculiar disease, the essential lesion of which is believed to be seated in the semicircular canals. The leading symptoms are that the sufferer is suddenly attacked with giddiness, with an inclination to fall to one side, accompanied by nausea, retching, singing noises in the ear, sweating, and pallor. These symptoms pass off after a time, but leave the patient with a certain amount of deafness, which increases after each attack In these cases there is always loss of power to hear sounds transmitted through he cranial bones in the affected ear. No treatment is of much use in this affection. Rest, counter irritation, quinine in large doses, and the bromides have all been recommended. i^J' or singing noises in the ear, may be continuous or intermittent It arises from many causes, which may be general or local • among the former are anc^mia, large doses of quinine or salicin ; among he latter are plugs of wax in the meatus; or alteration in pressure in the abjrinth, which may arise from fluid in the tympanum and obstruction of cause ^ treatment must necessarily depend upon its r.ni=;^^'*i*°^y Yertigo is characterised by a sudden attack which causes he patient to reel to one side or to fall either backwards or forwards u 1.S not as a rule accompanied by unconsciousness, but is frequently followed to th.rnff ''"""^T^- Jhe attacks are paroxysmal, but patients liable mef.Z , fi? ^°;:^p!^^" °f giddiness.

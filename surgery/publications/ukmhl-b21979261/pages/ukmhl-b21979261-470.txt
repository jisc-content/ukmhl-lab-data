Fracture at the junction of the neck with fho trochanter.-These fractures are often describeraf.. "a'.*^..2" — but this term is quite incorrect, as the fracture in front is entirely within the capsule, though behind it is outside it In front the line of fracture lies internal to the anterior intertrochanteric ridge to whicli the capsular ligament is attached This fracture is produced by direct violence, such as blows or falls on the hip, and is very frequently impacted (hg. 152). In fact, there seems very good reason to believe that in most, if not all of these cases, on account of the direction of the violence which produces the fracture, the neck of the bone IS driven into the loose cancellous tissue, where it may either remain fixed or may split up the trochanter and so no fixation takes place. These fractures are therefore very often comminuted. The displacement is much the same as in the fracture of the neck, but is greater in amount, as there is nothing to oppose the force of muscular action' reco^fSdlTe'verfmoch t'"'' " """-'fP^^^d extra-capsular fracture is but They are ven m.^h ^""^ """capsular variety, .he zii To .e.^™°^;:-t..e?'''%tr'r? and there is more disnlacempnl of h \^ f .

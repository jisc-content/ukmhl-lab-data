DISLOCATION OF THE ELBOW be mistaken for transverse fracture of the lower end of the shaft of the humerus, but the relations between the condyles and olecranon process are_ altered, and the condyles do not move with the displaced olecranon ; while the measurement from the acromion process to the external condyle remains unaltered. Dislocation forwards is a very rare injury; only a few cases having been recorded where it has taken place, unless after fracture of the olecranon. It can only occur from direct violence to the olecranon when the forearm is in a position of extreme flexion. It may be complete or incomplete. In the former the olecranon is in front of the articular surface of the humerus ; in the incomplete form it rests against it. Fig. 183.—Skiagraph of a case of dislocation of the elbow backwards. Symptoms.—The forearm is flexed and lengthened. The prominence of the olecranon is lost, and the condyles of the humerus can be felt at the back of the joint, under the triceps, which is often considerably lacerated. The head of the radius and the coronoid process of the ulna can generally be detected in front, some distance below the level of the elbow joint. Lateral dislocation of both bones of the forearm.— These dislocations are almost always incomplete, the outward dislocation bemg far the more common of the two. In the outtmrd dislocation the greater .sigmoid cavity rests on the capitellum or radial head of the humerus, and the radius projects beyond the humerus. In the dislocation inwards the greater sigmoid cavity rests upon the internal condyle, while the head of the radius, strongly pronated, is lodged in the coronoid fossa of the humerus.

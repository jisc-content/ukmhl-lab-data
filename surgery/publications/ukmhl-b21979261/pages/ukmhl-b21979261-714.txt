678 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS t umour consists of growths, often of considerable size, made up of a number of cy^ , S more or less Lolid matter between them. The solid portion coiSts of columns of epithelial cells, resembling those o the gum, bound together by a fibrous stroma, and the cysts are due to colloid degeneration of°these columns. They contain a viscid, yellowish fluid. The treatment consists in the removal of the portion of the bone from which they grow, together with the tumour itself. Solid tumours of the lower jaw include the same vaneties^as were noted as occurring in the upper jaw : among innocent tumours, fibromata chondronmta and osteomata ; and among malignant tumours, sarcomata and carc nom^^^^ The sarcomata are met with in the lower jaw as mrelo7 sph.dle-celled, and round-celled. The myeloid occurs not only as myeioia, spinuic malignant epulis (see page 671), but also as a central growth, generally in the horizontal portion of the bone, which it expands (fig. 261). It is perhaps of all forms of myeloid tumour the least malignant, and in many cases a cure may be effected by cutting away the outer shell of bone, scraping away the new Fig. 261.-Myeloid tumour of the ^ ^ swabbing out the cavity with o7sT Hosp taf """^ c"boUc add.

The round- or spindle-celled sarcomata spring rom ^e perbSeum, and are much more malignant. In these cases nothing but wide removal of the bone is of any avail. ^„,„,^„. ppiipd Carcinoma of the lower jaw occurs only ^^^/q^^^^^^'^^^^^ epithelioma, generally arising from an extension °f disease from ^^^^^ tongue, lips, or gums, and requires removal of a portion of the Ja^^, together with the primary disease. . • ^ ti,p treatment of Excision of the lower jaw is required in the treatment, 01 tumours arising from this bone or secondarily ^^^P^^^^ting it.

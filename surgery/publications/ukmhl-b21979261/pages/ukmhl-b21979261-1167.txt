1129 APPENDIX AMPUTATION I)Y the word amputation is meant the removal of a part of the body, and in its widest sense is applied to the removal of certain organs, as the breast, testicle, or penis ; but in its more restricted sense it is commonly applied to the removal of a portion or the whole of a limb, and it is only in this restricted sense that it will be used in this place. In performing an amputation, the main points which a sui-geon has in view are : (i) the removal of the whole of the diseased tissues or those injured beyond the hope of recovery, and to do this with as little sacrifice of parts as possible ; and (2) to cut flaps of proper shape and long enough to cover the end of the bone or bones without tension. There are three main ways in which this latter object may be attained: i. by the circular method; 2. by the flap operation ; and c B A Fig. 427.—Diagram showing the line of incision in (a) circular, (B) flap, and (c) oval amputation. 3. by the oval or racquet-shaped incision. These principal modes are variously modified to suit different conditions, as will be explained in the sequel. I. The circular method (fig. 427, a).—The flaps in the circular method are fashioned by making a cut round the skin of the Hmb, some inches below the point at which it is intended to sever the bone ; then dissecting up the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the deep fascia, and throwing them back, like the cuff of a sleeve (fig. 428), about two-thirds of the distance towards the point of intended section of the bone. The superficial muscles are then divided by a second circular sweep of the knife at this level. The muscles retract, when divided, by virtue of their contractility, allowing the deeper muscles to be severed down to the bone at a higher level by a final circular sweep of the knife. Lastly, all the soft parts are pushed upwards from the exposed bone, and this is

662 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS tuberde, and snips through the anterior pillar of the fauces It will now be found that the whole of this half of the tongue can be pulled out of the mouth He now proceeds leisurely to snip through the muscular sub- stance of the tongue, commencing on the dorsum close to the glosso- epiglottidean folds, and in doing this as he gets to the under surface he ^^^il^ divide the extrinsic muscles attached to the under surface of the tongue, the stylo-glossus, the hyo-glossus and the genio-hyo-glossus. In dividing the fibres of the hyo-glossus he must be careful to remove also the glands which lie on its superficial surface. Should the Ungual or any arterv bleed it must at once be seized by an assistant with clip forceps ; and should the bleeding be severe, which can only occur in those cases where the lincrual artery has not been secured beforehand, the plan recommended bv Chdstopher Heath should be adopted. The forefinger is passed over the tongue till it touches the epiglottis, and is then turned towards the side on which the artery is to be compressed and pushed forcibly against the â– "^^^ After the half of the tongue has been removed, any bleeding points, if there are any, should be secured with ligatures. The whole tongue may be removed by a somewhat similar proceedmg. A strong ligature is passed through the tip. The frasnum mucous mem- brane of the floor of the mouth, genio-hyo-glossus muscle and an erior pillar of the fauces are divided with scissors, and the tongue pulled well out of the mouth. It is then gradually snipped through with scissors, the lingual arteries being secured with clip forceps just before they divided. The whole of the rawed surface is now to be painted over with VV hite- head''^ varnish, consisting of friar's balsam, in which a saturated solution of tdoform in ether is substituted for the alcohol ; or it may be freely dusted with iodoform. u ^ ;^ The extra-buccal modes of removing the tongue are numerous, but it will be sufficient if we describe in this place the two methods which are ''^oSi^ir^tTvLtion is employed in those cases where the floor of the mouth and the glands in the ^^^.^^/^^^^'^V'^'l .n^tre'nhivnx impHcated.

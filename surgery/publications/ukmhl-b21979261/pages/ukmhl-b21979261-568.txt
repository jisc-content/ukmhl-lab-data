54-2' . INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES in the.joint persists, though it may become diminished. At this .stage, grating on mo\-ement will be perceptible, and extreme mobility of the articulation, especially in the hinge joints, in a lateral direction. A flail-like joint now results, and great unsteadiness in walking if the disease is in the lowei' extremity. Dislocation may now ensue. Conjoined with these local signs there is always more or less evidence of locomotor ataxy. The principal symptoms of this are: want of co-ordination in the muscles of the limbs ; inability to stand steadily or walk with the eyes shut; absence of the patellar reflex; the ' Argyle Robertson pupil,' i.e. loss of reaction of the pupil to light, while it accommodates itself for near vision; lightning pains in the limbs and joints ; a history of so-called gastric crises ; loss of Fig. 192.—Photograph showing the deformity in Charcot's disease of the knee.

In the former the onset is sudden, is attended with considerable efl"usion, and is pamlesb , in the latter the onset is gradual, is rarely attended with much effusion, and is painful. In Charcot's disease dislocation is common ; in osteo-arthritis 1 is rare The progress of the two diseases is also dissimilar : in the former it may be arrested or may subside entirely, in the latter the disease is progres- sive and generally permanent. In addition to these distinctive signs m

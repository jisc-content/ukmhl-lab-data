GENERAL INJURIES 54 Here it coagulates, and then, losing some of its water by evaporation, dries, and so forms an occlusive dressing which covers the wound and prevents any entrance of micro-organisms from without. Underneath this dried layer of lymph, another portion in contact with the tissues beneath under- goes vascularisation and becomes converted into granulation tissue, which in its turn forms scar tissue, identically in the same manner as in union of wounds by first intention. As soon as the process is completed the scab begins to break away or separate at its margins, and as it does so the epithelium spreads in over the surface of the newly formed tissue, so that before it is completely detached a new layer of epithelium covers the surface of the wound. The main reason why union by scabbing is not oftener encouraged by the surgeon is the length of time which must elapse before the scab becomes occlusive to the entrance of micro-organisms, so that if it is attempted to bring about union in this way, it will frequently be found that suppuration takes place beneath the scab, because some micro-organisms have been admitted before the scab was formed, and thus the ends in view are defeated. Occlusion of wounds by what may be regarded in sonie respects as an artificial scab is sometimes resorted to by the surgeon, as in covering a wound with collodion, or a piece of dry lint, into which the blood oozing from the wound penetrates and there coagu- lates, forming a scab. The plan is not, however, one to be recommended except in very small wounds, because the scab is very likely not to be complete over the whole Avound, but is likely to leave some small opening by which micro-organisms may find an entrance. From what has been said as to these three modes of union of wounds, it is obvious that they are only modifications of the same process and that identically the same mode of formation of the connecting medium or scar takes place in all. They might therefore all be classed together under one head, as instances of union of wounds without suppuration. 4- Union by second intention or by granulation.â€”As I have already stated, the difference between the union of wounds by first and second intention is one rather of degree than of kind, and in both the changes which take place are very similar. In the union of wounds by granulation these changes are carried on to a further degree than in the other mode of union, and this is due to the fact that there is a longer continuance of the inflammation which is set up, and this prolongation of the niflammatory process is brought about by some irritation which contmues to act for an appreciable length of time after the injury. It may be, and most frequently is, the presence of pyogenic micro-organisms, but It may also be the irritation of dressings, or chemical substances applied to the wound, especially where there has been loss of tissue, so that the edges of the wound cannot be brought in apposition; or it may be due to the presence of dead tissue in the wound, which has first to be got rid of, before union can take place, as in contused and lacerated wounds, burns and scalds, &c. It will be most convenient to consider this mode of union in a gaping wound, that is to say, one in which the edges have not been brought together. In such a case the initial changes are the same as in union by first intention ; the htemorrhage first of all ceases and the blood coagulates in the cut vessels up to the first collateral branch : then inflammation is set up as the result of the injury and exudation takes place over the surface of the wound ; but now other causes come into play, and in consequence of the presence of pyogenic organisms the inflammation, instead of subsiding and disappearmg as it did in union by first intention, is prolonged, and

56o INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES palmar aspect. By deepening this incision cision of the wrist. Excision of the wrist joint.—The only cases in which excision of the wrist is required are cases of tuberculous dis^ease. This is to be done by he method introduced by Lord Lister, which is planned so as to avoid muring any of the tendons going to the fingers and thumb and divide o ly thoseSvhich belong to the wrist proper. I he first step in the operation consists in moving the fingers;^ and thumb freely, so as o break down anv adhesions. An incision is then made from the m ddle of the ^n lnl surface of the radius, on a level with the base of the styloid process, doisal surface ottlic aa, ^^^^^^ et:rr"pota^ as fjr:: the radial side of the base of the second r olnl hone close to the insertion of the extensor carpi radialis I't o 'a^id'i ThW carried straight onwards along the radial border of the Serior surface of this bone for half its length (fig. 198). In this LdsTon the extensor carpi radialis brevior is divided, and the extensor ca™ Tad alis longior, which is exposed, is now to be severed close to its carpi raaidiib b attachment to the metacarpal bone (fig. 199). By extending the wrist and cutting between the tendons and the bone, the extensor tendons are to be separated from the back of the wrist as far as possible towards the ulnar side, and the extensor tendons of the thumb and the radial artery separated on the outer side of the incision. A pair of cutting pliers are now to be introduced into the wound, and the trapezium separated from the other bones of the carpus. The hand is then turned over so that the palm is uppermost, and an incision made on the ulnar side, commencing two inches above its lower extremity, and carried along its anterior border across the wrist and as far as the middle of the fifth metacarpal bone on its the knife is carried between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the bone, then through the ^^-'^^^^-^'^^YI'^^^^ ^om cuneiform till it meets the unciform process of ^he Jiciform bone which is to be cut off mth bone forceps. The tendons and soft parts are L'fto b^ completely separated fro^. the bones, and tl- extensor car^^^ ulnaris divided as close to its attachment as possible ^^e dorsa and internal lateral ligaments are also to be cut. By A^^^S^^h^hand at the wrist, the soft parts are now to be separated from the bones b> carrying he knife horizontally between them. In doing this the knife must be kept close to the bone for fear of wounding the ulnar artery and nerve, and the separation must not be carried beyond the bases o he mPtTraroal bones to avoid the deep palmar arch. After now dividmg tTe anterior Ugan e^ of the wrist, the carpus will be freed from the radius above ar^d bffntroducing the bone forceps and cutting across the line 0 arricuiation of the carpus and metacarpus, it can be extrac ed ^^-^^H^^' of sequestrum forceps, any slight attachments remaining being touched '''^Te^rte^S^^^^^^ and the unciform process still remain ; the twoTaUe^a?: to be left^unless the pisiform is so ^-eased - to^^^^^^^^ its removal, but the trapezium is to be removed, gieat care being, la Fig. 198.—Diagram showing the lines of incision in Lister's ex-

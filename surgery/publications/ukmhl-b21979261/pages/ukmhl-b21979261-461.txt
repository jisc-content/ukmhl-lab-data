The eparatioi o the broken fragments can usually be ascertained by burying the fingers m this soft swelling, and will be found to be increased on flex- ing the forearm. No crepitus can be felt unless the fractured process is drawn down into contact with the rest of the bone. In some cases the ligamentous tissues around are not ruptured, and then no depression will be present, but there mil be loss of power in the arm, and crepitus will be easily obtained. Treatment.—There can be no doubt that the plan of treatment which yields the best results is to expose the fracture Fig. 145.—Fracture of the olecranon, showing the byalongitudinalincision; clear displacement caused by the action of the triceps, awayall blood clots and shreds (From Gray's Anatomy. ) ?/a'rd rSeHndthC^vire them together with a silver wire. . Holes are drilled in the bones by a bradawl, introduced on the pos erior sur- fece of the bone and carried obliquely through its thickness to emerge on the fractured surface close to the articular cartilage. The holes must correspond to each other, so that when the bones are brovight together the SoTiSnents will be in the same plane. A silver wire is then introduced the w? fragments are approximated, the wire twisted, cut off short, and the end buried in the periosteum. If the surgeon is confident of his power to carry this proceeding through aseptically, and especially if the patien s young, vigorous, and of sound health, this is the plan of treatment which should be adopted. If, however, from any cause, it is thought to be desir- able not to operate, the fragments should be approximated by strapping or figure-of-8 bandage as far as possible, and the arm put up on a straight anterior splint. If there is much swelling it is better to defer the applica- tion of the bandage until it has subsided. At the end of a fortnight or three weeks the forearm should be gently flexed, with the thumb pressing on the top of the olecranon to prevent the union giving, and the arm put up on an angular splint. The union under these circumstances is fibrous, and ankylosis is very likely to result. . In cases where the fragments have been wired passive motion may be begun gently at the end of a week; but in those in which the injury has

In these cases loss of smell (anosmia) is the result The optic nerve may also be injured in those cases of racture of the anterior fossa of the base of the skull which involve the lesser wing of the sphenoid and extend into the optic foramen. It may also be torn across in thrust wounds of the orbit, or may be compressed by hremorrhage or inflammatory exudation. These injuries are accompanied by loss of sight. The third, fourth, and sixth nerves may be injured either as they he in the cavernous sinus, or as they pass through the sphenoidal fissure in fracture of the base of the skull; or they may be torn in cases of penetrating wounds of the orbit, or blows causing laceration of drnnn!;.rnf '^r^ '^'''^ ""7' P^'^^Y'^^' there will be ptosis or drooping of the eyelid; external strabismus, from the unbalanced action diln nHnn nfTv.

(2) The phosphate oflnne is only deposited when the urine is alkaline, and forms a white cloudy mass, usually at the end of the act of micturition. When it occurs in the urine in_ excess it is precipitated by heat and may be mistaken for albumen, but is speedily redissolved by the addition of Lid. Under the microscope it is usually amorphous, but may sometimes be seen in the form of spherules. This condition is often associated with overwork and mental strain, and It also occurs in some forms of disease of the nervous system. (3) The mixed phosphates, consisting of a mixture of phosphate of lime, ammonia, and magnesia, are the form of phosphates met with in ammoniacal urine. They are in- soluble in water, and when set free from their solution in the urine, which is done by the ammonia in the decomposing fluid, they are readily thrown down and deposited on any foreign body introduced into the bladder. Carbonate of lime is now and then met with as a deposit in faintly alkaline urine ; but It is doubtful if it ever forms a calculus, though it is said that it has sometimes been found forming a distinct stratum in a phosphatic stone. The various kinds of calculi correspond to the deposits and the fhrPP Uric acid calculus is ovoid or round, of a fawn or reddish bro.^ colour.

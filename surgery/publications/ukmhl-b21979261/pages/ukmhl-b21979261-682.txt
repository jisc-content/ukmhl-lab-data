656 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS solution of bicarbonate of potash (gr. xx to gj), and the teeth brushed Dilute chromic acid and concentrated lactic acid have been recommended as local applications, but sometimes appear to aggravate the disease. Internallv the administration of arsenic appears to do good, and in syphilitic cases antisyphilitic remedies must be exhibited. In these latter cases I have found the internal administration of Donovan s solution- liquor arsenii et hydrarg. iodidi-with a powder consisting of grey powder five -rains, and compound tragacanth powder fifteen grains, to be placed on the tongue once a day, the best means of treating these cases. The powder forms a paste with the saliva, and gradually dissolves. While doin^r so it is to be kept in contact with the diseased surface. Annulus migrans—Another condition of the tongue has been described, occurring principally in children, but also sometimes in adults It commences as small round spots of light-coloured appearance, which ranidlv develop into a more or less complete circle, and spread centn- fueallY over the tongue. It is not very painful, but causes a sensation of itching and is attended with increased salivation. It bears some resemblance to ringworm, but is not apparently due to a parasite The disease is very chronk in character, may disappear for_ a time, and then reappear. No treatment appears to have any effect on it. u- u <.u Ulceration of the tongue.-The varieties of ulcer to which he tongue is liable are the irritable, the dyspeptic the tuberculous, and the svSic (i) IrrM ulcers are usually caused by the irritation produced by a agged tooth. They are therefore situated on the side of the tongue, .nd icf often very painful. The treatment consists m extracting or filing Ure tooth (^r^J^?^^^ -l^^rs are usually multiple, and situated on the dorsum and ides of the tongue. The ulcers are circular and superficial with an inflamed area around.' They are not indurated; are very painful especially during mastication. The treatment consists m correcting the state of the digestive organs, and touching the ulcers with nitrate of silver II) TuberaUom ulcer rare disease which has only been recogmsed ^^^^ recent years. It is generally secondary to tuberculous disease of the lungs or hrvnx he organ being infected by the sputum. It consists in an isolated mas^K^^^^ ciseates and breaks down, forming an irregular ulcer generally on the under surface or sides of the tip of the tongue i tie §ges are sharply defined, the base nodular and uneven and it is ex- quiskely pa n?ul^ often causing intolerable suffering. Treatment must be rected to rdieving the pain, since the disease is incurable on account of tt'constitutional 'condiSon.' If this is very severe, the ^^^^^^^^^^ freely scraped, which will do much to relieve the pain. It has been advisea in some of these cases to resect a portion of the lingual nerve. In less pai^^ful cases the local application of -d^for- and n^rphia^^^^^^^^^ administration of cod-liver oil, are indicated.

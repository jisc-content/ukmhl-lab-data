447 FRACrURES OF THE FEMUR and is drawn inwards by the adductors and rotated outwards by tiie weight of the Hmb, possibly assisted by the adductors (fig. 153). In the middle third the displacement is much the same, but the upper frag- ment is drawn inwards by the adductor brevis and longus. In the lower third the upper fragment is also drawn inwards by the adductors, while the lower fragment, especially if the fracture is near the condyles, is pulled backwards into the popUteal space by the gastrocnemms (fig. 154)- Though these are the most comnion dis- placements, they are subject to considerable variations, depending, as has been said, upon the direction which the fracture takes. In children, where the fracture is transverse and the periosteum is not completely torn across, little or no displacement may take place. Symptoms.—The signs of fracture of the shaft of the femur are usually well marked.

Any attempt to move the limb will cause pain, and a solution of continuity in the bone will be at once detected. Crepitus can readily be elicited. If there is much displacement, the fragments can generally be felt under the skin. Treatment.—There is probably no form of fracture for which so many different kinds of appliance have at various times been recommended as

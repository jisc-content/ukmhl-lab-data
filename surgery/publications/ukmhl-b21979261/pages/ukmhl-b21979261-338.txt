Nevertheless, syphilis may ^condarily produce atheroma, for it undoubtedly induces a disease of the arS system, principally affecting the smaller arteries, which narrows their lumen, aAd^herefore, by producing mechanical stram in the larger vessels may be a cause of the disease. • ^ • .v, S en^-When atheroma is well established it can be recognised m the «nnPrfirial vcsscls such as the temporal, by their elongation and tortuosity, rd abTby th? locomotion,' as it is called, of the vessel; that is a change fn the posftion of the vessel with each contraction of the ventricles.

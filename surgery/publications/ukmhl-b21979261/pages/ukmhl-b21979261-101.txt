PUNCTURED WOUNDS 75 amount of tissue is killed outright, and that there must be sloughing and suppuration before repair can commence. And so it is in these cases of punctured wounds, with this serious addition, that on account of the character of the wound the inflammatory products cannot escape as they do in an ordinary lacerated and contused wound on the surface of the body but remain pent up in the tissues and produce deep-seated tension which mav be productive of the most serious consequences. In addition to this, punctured wounds when deep may injure blood-vessels, or open up cavities and wound the contained viscera, so that these wounds are amdngst the gravest with which the surgeon has to deal. Nothing need be said about the symptoms of these cases ; the presence of a small wound, with the history of the way it was caused, is sufficien to establish the diagnosis. The surgeon should, however, make careful inquiries into all the circumstances of the accident, the position of the patient and the manner in which the injury was inflicted, to establish the direction which the wound has taken; the nature of the instrument which caused the wound, its shape, its sharpness, and whether it was septic or not. This latter point may sometimes be guessed at by col ateral evidence ; as, for instance, supposing a butcher has accidentally stabbed himself with the knife he uses to cut up meat, the inference would be that the wound was septic Supposing that after these inquiries it turns out that the wound was inflicted with a sharp-pointed and clean instrument, and that it has not passed in the direction of any of the serous or synovial cavities of the body, and there is little or no bleeding and no swelling of the tissues around, the wound may be at once covered with layers of antiseptic gauze and a band- age applied, and the wound may heal without any untoward symptoms. J3ut the surgeon must watch the case closely and be prepared if any swelling comes on, or if there is any heat and pain about the part, or above all any rise of temperature, to at once open up the wound and drain it thoroughly. On the other hand, if there is any evidence that there has been contusion or laceration of the edges of the punctured wound, or that any foreign or septic matter has been introduced, it is worse than useless to adopt this plan The wound should be washed out with some antiseptic solution by means of a syringe; and care must be observed in doing this, so as not to force the fluid out of the wound into the cellular planes. The nozzle ot the syringe must never be allowed to block up the orifice of the wound so as to prevent the return of the fluid ; if the external wound is not large enough to admit the nozzle and leave a space by the side of it, it must be enlarged. After the wound has been thoroughly syringed, a drainage tube must be inserted into its whole length and the wound dressed with antiseptic dress- ing If at the end of forty-eight hours there is no rise of temperature the tube mky be shortened by about one half, but not removed altogether. Its final removal must be determined by circumstances: if there is no discharge ot pus from it, it mav be shortened day by day and speedily got rid of; if, on the other hand, pus discharges through it, it should not be withdrawn until the discharge of matter almost, if not quite, ceases. In cases where there is constant oozing of blood from a punctured wound, and especially it the blood is bright and arterial in character, the wound should be enlarged and the injured vessel sought for, and when found, tied if completely divided ; if only punctured, tied above and below the puncture and divided between (see Wounds of Arteries). Among punctured wounds must be classed those cases where a needle, or some such sharp, narrow body, penetrates the skin, and cither breaks off, a part being left m the tissues, or else the

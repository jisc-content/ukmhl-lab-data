COMPRESSION 327 effect that I have been able to trace to them is that, somehow or other, iodide of potassium seems to have an undoubted beneficial effect in relieving the pain of aneurism. Valsalva's plan aimed at gradually diminishing the quantity of blood in the system, and reducing the force of the heart, and so the pressure on the walls of the aneurism, and, when this had been done, increasing the plasticity of the blood by gradual and careful feeding. The first of these aims he accomplished by a gradual reduction of the food day by day, until it was lowered to the smallest quantity compatible mth life; by subjecting the patient to frequently repeated small bleedings ; and by the administration of saline purgatives. When by this means the patient had been reduced to the lowest ebb, so that he could not be raised in bed without fainting, he was gradually built up again by careful and judicious feeding, and by no longer having recourse to the bleeding and purging. It IS seldom that the plan of treatment recommended by Valsalva is adopted in its entirety by surgeons in the present day, but in a somewhat modified form either this plan or Tufnell's, or a modified combination of the two, may be usefully employed in those cases of aneurism where no local measures can be adopted. b. Local treatment.—The local or surgical methods of treating aneurism are very various, for in addition to the two principal methods, (i) com- pression and (2) ligature, many others have at different times been recommended and resorted to, such as (3) excision; (4) manipulation; (5) introduction of coagulating agents ; (6) galvano-puncture; (7) injection of ergotin ; (8) acupuncture; and (9) introduction of foreign bodies. We shall first discuss the two principal measures, and then briefly refer to these other means of bringing about the cure of an aneurism. I. Compression.—The object of pressure as now employed is either to entirely or partially arrest the flow of blood through the sac of the aneurism and so produce consohdation either by the formation of an ordinary clot or by the deposit of laminated fibrin. Up to quite recent times this plan of treat- ment was always resorted to, when possible, before any attempt was made to cure the aneurism by ligature of the artery. Before the introduction of aseptic surgery, the risks of ligature from secondary hjemorrhage and other septic processes was so great, that surgeons hesitated to resort to an operation involv- ing an open wound until all other measures had been fairly tried and failed iiut there IS, I think a growing feeling in the minds of surgeons that, in many cases at all events, they will be best consulting the welfare of their patients bv at once resorting to ligature in cases of aneurism, without attempting to a cure an^ U'^'^T "^'^ .'T^"^ ^^^^^ ^^''^'^ «f effecting compission Mn ^'"'f'' *° P^^^^"^ ^^^^ ^^^^il^d by J3s enW a^rl'li'T'' lo"g-continued pressure the collateral the bLd D fSur.l ?K ' °^ ^'■'"^y ^^^^ therefore less effect on h!i 1 P'^^'^'^e,/" the aneurism, since blood finds its way into it through JurbvliSek°^^''"\T^^ '''^ P'-^^P^^^' therefore! of effecting^ to prevbusTv St iT nl^l^^ long-continued compression has been resorled reErhv ro^n L ^^"^^ "^"'^t be confessed that the andThere a?e Zn^ '\ ^"'"'^"'^ ^ considerable measure of success, ^re \h7mSci^T 7T^^^^ °f ^^ich the following

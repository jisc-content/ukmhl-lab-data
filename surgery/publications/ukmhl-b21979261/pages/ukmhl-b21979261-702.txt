Malignant disease of the tonsil—The tonsu is sometimes, though not very often, the seat of malignant disease, either sarcomatous or carcinomatous. . . ,,11^ Sarcoma is the more common of the two ; it is usually a lympho- sarcoma but, in addirion to this, a round-celled sarcoma is occasionally met with. They form soft, rounded, rapidly growmg tumours which pro- iect into the fauces and interfere with deglutition and respiration. Ihey speedily infiltrate surrounding structures and implicate the lymphatic glands in front of the sterno-mastoid. Treatment.—If seen and diagnosed early, these tumours may be re- moved from the mouth with very little hfemorrhage. 1 he capsule is divided by the galvano-cautery, and the tumour shelled out. Recurrence is very likely to take place, and if the glands are implicated, and the surrounding structures involved, nothing can be done by operative means to reheve the patient. . , Carcinoma of the tonsil is of the squamous-celled variety, and, unlike the sarcomata, rarely begins in the tonsil itself, but usually spreads to it from the tongue, fauces or palate. It forms a hard, "^d^^^^ed rugged ulcerated surfacef with a sloughy base, and very rapidly involves the ^^'^Seatment-In most cases the disease is too extensive to admit of operative interference, but if it is fairly limited an attempt to/f^o;^ ' from the neck may be undertaken.

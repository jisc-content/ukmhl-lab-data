302 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES secondary haemorrhage takes place is very characteristic. As a rule the open g the wall of the vessel from which the blood issues ,s at first e?cTedhigly minute, and only a few drops escape; then the hole becomes SuSedwith a clo^, and no more bleeding occurs for some hours. As, howfver, the molecular disintegration of the coats of the artery proceeds, the clot becomes separated, and a fresh and rather more copious bleeding occurs and may again be arrested by the formation of another clot, and so thS ^ecuirine hemorrhage goes on until the hole in the vessel has acquired a coSaWe siS^ and then a copious, and it may be fatal, hemorrhage Treatment-When secondary hcemorrhage occurs after ligature of an artery whether it is the end of a divided vessel in a wound or the artery has been li-atured in its continuity, the recognised rule in surgery is to Se measures to secure the vessel, because it is certain that if secondary hemorrhage has once occurred it will recur at no very distant period. T will be convenient to consider the plan of treatment under two heads • (i) when the bleeding comes from the end of a divided artery, as in a stump ; and (2) when it comes from an artery which has been ligatured in Tsecondary h^morrliage from a divided artery in a stump.-If the bleeding has been slight, and the flaps are not distended with blood it is kistifiable to raisi the stump, apply an artery compressor to the ve el above in order to diminish the blood pressure, and an elastic Sess nfand bandage to the stump itself.

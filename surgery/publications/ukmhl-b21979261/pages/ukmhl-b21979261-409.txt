The adult animal exists in some part of the lymphatic system, but the embryos are set free in the lymph and enter the blood stream, but according to Manson are found there only at night. Elephantiasis begins with attacks of lymphangitis, accompanied by fever (elephantoid fever), and each attack is followed by increased enlargement of the part affected. In Barbadoes leg (fig. 120) the disease is generally confined to the tissues below the knee, but sometimes the whole limb may be affected.

The skin becomes hard and thick, and presents a coarse warty appearance. Sometimes it cracks and ulcerates. The disease is almost confined to the superficial structures, but the blood-vessels supplying the part are enlarged, as are also the lymphatic channels. The muscles are usually wasted, pale, and fatty. Lymph scrotum {elephantiasis scroti) (fig. 121) occurs in those cases where the upper chain of the inguinal glands are obstructed by the filarife. It begins with an attack of inflammation, with fever, and this is followed by swelling of the scrotum, which becomes covered with vesicles from which fluid escapes; this may be milky or sanguinolent, and in it

TREATMENT OF FROST BTFE III lobule of the ear or the tip of the nose; or it may be a finger or a toe, especially the great toe, or a whole limb may perish. The part becornes swollen and black, or may become dry and shrivelled, and separates tardily, leaving an ulcerated surface, which is very slow to heal. Treatment.â€”In the treatment of frost bite, the first indication is to endeavour to restore the vitality of the frozen parts, and this must be done with the very greatest care. The natural impulse would be to apply as much warmth as possible ; but if this is done, inflammation is sure to occur, with attendant thrombosis, and the inevitable occurrence of gan- grene. The circulation should be restored as slowly as possible, by keeping the patient in a cool room and rubbing the part with cold fur or flannel, or, as is frequently recommended, with snow. If the patient is much depressed, a little cold brandy and water may be given. As the parts recover themselves, much tingling and even pain will be complained of. As this passes off, he may be brought into a warmer room, and the part wrapped in dry flannel or wool. If in spite of this treatment the frozen part perishes, the case must be treated in the same manner as a burn, care being taken to preserve asepsis as much as possible during the separation of the dead parts. In some of these cases the question of amputation may arise. The rule is not to perform this until the line of demarcation is formed, for it is impossible to tell how far the gangrene may extend, and the surgeon might remove too much or too little. When the line of demarcation has formed, the sooner the condemned part is removed the better.

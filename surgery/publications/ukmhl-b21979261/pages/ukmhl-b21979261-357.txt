HUNTERIAN OPERATION 33, but It cannot be undertaken without considerable risk to the patient, as gangrene of the Hmb and rupture of the sac have both occurred from its use. It is, moreover, by no means certain in its results, and should never be employed where there is disease of the heart or an internal aneurism, on account of the increase in the blood pressure in the heart and large arteries in consequence of the displacement of the blood from the limb. 2. Treatment by ligature (hg. 100). The treatment of aneurism by ligature was practised by the older surgeons. The first method of treat- mentj usually called the old operation or the method of Antyllus, consisted m laymg open the sac, turning out the clot, and ligaturing the artery above and belovv the aneurism. This was followed by the method of Anel, which consisted in ligaturing the artery immediately above the aneurism, without opening the sac. Seventy-five years afterwards Hunter introduced his operation, which is known as the Hunterian operation, and consists in ligaturing the artery at a distance from the aneurism. These three operations all aim at ligatming the artery on the cardiac side of the aneurism; but in those cases where this cannot be done, Brasdor proposed tying the trunk of the artery on Its distal side, and finally Wardrop proposed tying the main branches of the artety on the distal side m those cases where neither Brasdor's operation nor ligature on the cardiac side can be done. The Hunterian operation is the one most frequently adopted, and wll therefore be first considered. The advantages claimed for this operation as compared with Anel's are four in number, (i) First, the operation of cutting down and tying a normal artery is very much easier and simpler than exposing a vessel close to an aneurismal sac, where the anatomical relations are liable to be disturbed, and possibly the vessel overlapped by the aneurism._ (2) That in tying the artery close to the aneurism there is funni,r?Hnn '7T^l I f.'"'"' ^^'^ ^"^^^ht lead to its inflammation and 3l tr;. i^K ^f^ ^^^T'J ^^^'^"^^ the aneurism is moi e hkely to be healthy, and therefore can be tied with less risk than can be done m close proximity to the sac. (4) That as in all probability branches will be given off from the artery between the point oflig °ture and he aneurism, which will anastomose with branches given off above The ligature, he circulation through the aneurism will not be completeirarrested but only lessened, a condition favourable to the formation of cSlS a S manent character. There is no question that in these days of antisepti^ surgery these advantages are not so great as they were in the pre-a t ept c days.

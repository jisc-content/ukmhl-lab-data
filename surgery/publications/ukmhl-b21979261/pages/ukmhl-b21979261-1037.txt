999 CONSEQUENCES OF STRICTURE the bladder becomes sacculated. Urine is contained in these saccules, and is not voided because they have no muscular walls; it decom- poses, sets up inflammation and suppuration, and they become abscess cavities; or the walls of the saccules may ulcerate, and extravasa- tion takes place into the cellular tissue outside the bladder, or Fig. 383.—Stricture in tiie penile por- FiG. 3S4.—Dilated ureter from stricture tion of the urethra, showing tlilatation of the urethra. (From the Museum of the urethra behind the stricture. of St. George's Hospital.) (From the Museum of St. George's Hospital.) phosphatic concretions may form in them. Occasionally, where there is retention, the bladder becomes dilated and thinned, and its overstrained walls lose their power of contractiHty. The ureters become dilated (fig. 384), from obstruction to the escape of the urine into the bladder, on account of that part of the ureter which perforates the muscular coat

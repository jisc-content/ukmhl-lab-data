488 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES hone is spongy and porous, and the trabeculai of which it is composed have a radiate direction from the surface of bone from which it grows. When these tumours do not ossify they erode the bone and may lead to spontaneous fracture. . Svmptoms.—The signs of the periosteal sarcoma are the presence of a tumour which is fixed to the bone. It has a rounded and definite margin, mav be' either smooth or tuberous on its surface, and is of varying consist- encv sometimes being yielding and elastic, at others presenting a hard and unyielding centre. The disease may be mistaken for a periosteal node hut its rapid and uniform increase, without any signs of inflammation, will determine the diagnosis. Skiagraphy may be of use in determining the nature of the disease, as in the case from which fig. 176 was taken, \yhich was one of peripheral sar- coma of the femur, which was detected at a very early stage by this means. It will be seen that the deeper parts of the growth are much darker, because here the tumour had undergone ossi- fication. Peripheral sarco- mata are very much more malignant than the central ones. They grow more rapidly, they show a much greater tendency to recur locally after removal, and there is frequently a deposit of the same growth in distant organs. The usual method of dissemination is by the veins. Diagnosis.—It is of great importance to distinguish clinically between the.peri- pheral and central sarcomata, as the treatment of the two conditions is very different, at all events when the central tumour is myeloid in its nature. The central tumours are spherical in outline, are preceded by an aching paui in the part, generally occur at Fig. 176.-Skiagraph of a peripheral sarcoma ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and of the femur. (By Mr. J. H.

As it collects, the wax becomes hard, and sometimes forms a complete cast of the tube. The condition can be at once diagnosed by means of the speculum. The treatment consists in washing the wax out by means of a syringe. This if properly applied, rarely fails to dislodge it, but warm ohve oil or weak alkaline solutions dropped into the ear some hours before the Syringe is used, materially assist its expulsion 1 he sjjinge should have n fine nozzle and the stream of warm water should be directed along the roof of the meatus. It then finds its way behind the mass,_ and as it returns it brings away the hardened mass of wax. When the plug is expelled, the symptoms are at once relieved; but in some cases an irritable condition of the meatus, requiring soothing appUcations, remams. Occasionally a vegetable fungus, belonging to the species of aspergiUus, may become located in the external meatus, and may be mistaken for an accumulation of wax as it gives rise to the same symptoms-deafness, giddiness, and tinnitus On examination the canal will present a black spotted appearance, and on syringing a membrane may be brought away, which on examination will be found to contain spores and mycelium. _ The treatment consists in frequent syringing, and then filhng the canal with an alcohoUc solution of boracic or salicylic acid Inflammation of the external meatus ^O itis ext rm) arises principally from injury or from the injection of irntatmg solutions, bu m?y also originate from other causes, as erysipelas eczema or may occur in the course of measles or scarlet fever in children.

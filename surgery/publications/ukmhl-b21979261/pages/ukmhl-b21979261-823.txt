TREATMENT OF WOUNDS OF THE LUNG 785 bronchial tubes. If the external wound is not large or valvular, the blood may collect in the pleural cavity and fatally compress the thoracic viscera Fatal hcemorrhage is more likely to occur in wounds from sharp pointed instruments, and this is the great danger to fear in wounds of this descrip- tion. "When the wound is oblique, there is the risk of air as well as blood collecting in the pleural cavity; but these wounds are not so liable to be followed by septic inflammation as a wound from a blunt instrument which can scarcely heal by first intention. In these latter cases decom- position of the extravasated blood and inflammatory eff'usion frequently occurs, and the presence of the irritating products of putrefaction in the wound may lead to an extension of the inflammation, with suppuration and possible gangrene of the lung, or may set up a condition of septicaemia from absorption of the ptomaines. Treatment.—In wounds of the lung from a sharp instrument in which the bleeding has ceased, an attempt should be made to obtain union by the first intention. The parts around the wound should be carefully cleansed, the edges of the wound brought together with sutures and dressed antiseptically. It is better to abstain from all examination ot the wound with probe or finger, as the proceeding might dislodge clots and cause a return of the haemorrhage. It is not desirable that the wound should be syrmged out with an antiseptic solution, as this might find its way into the pleural cavity, and, if the wound is deep, into the bronchial tubes. In bullet wounds, or in lacerated wounds from blunt instruments a careful exploration with an aseptic finger or a probe should be made to detect if possible any particles of clothing, pieces of bone, or bullet, and if found, these should be removed. The examination must not however, be carried too far, and must be conducted with the greatest gentleness, so as to avoid displacing any clots and causing a renewal of the hemorrhage. The parts around must be thoroughly cleansed, and dressed with an antiseptic dressing without closing the wound As a rule It is not necessary to insert a drainage tube. The patient must be kept in bed, lying on the injured side in order to secure efficient drainage, and to keep the injured lung as far as possible at rest. When haemorrhage is still gomg on, the first duty is to take measures to arrest it If it comes from an intercostal vessel it must be treated as described on page 7«o; but when it comes from a pulmonary vessel, there are two or three different plans which may be adopted. In the majority of cases the bleeding may be stayed by the administration of haemostatics and the application of cold, the patient being kept absolutely quiet on the injured ciVZ l TT"^?

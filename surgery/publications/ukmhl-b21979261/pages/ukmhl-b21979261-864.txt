826 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS whicli may be present, and the margins of the hepatic wound are united to the abdominal incision. The cavity may now either be packed with a long strip of iodoform gauze, the end of which is left protruding from the wound, or a soft large-sized drainage tube may be inserted, and the wound covered witli a large antiseptic dressing. Operation through the thoracic wall.—In many cases of absceS of the right lobe of the liver, it is impossible to open them through In abdominal incision, and it is then necessary to perform the operation by the 'transpleural' route. The patient is turned on to his left side, and an incision is made in the long axis of a rib over the most prominent part of the hepatic swelling; the rib is exposed, its periosteum separated, and about three inches excised. The pleura costalis is then divided In ' some instances this will open a circumscribed empyema, or the two layers of the pleura will be found to be adherent and the pleural cavity oblite- rated • if this is so, the diaphragm may be at once incised; but, if not, the diaphragm is sought for at the bottom of the wound, and the pleura cover- ing its surface divided in a Hne with the original incision; the serous membrane is then dissected up for a short distance on either side of the incision, and the margins united to the cut edge of the pleura costalis by a continuous suture. An incision is now made through the diaphragm, which is exposed at the bottom of the wound, and the margins of the incision dissected up for a short distance and sutured to the margins of the wound in the skin. It is now advisable to pack the parts with antiseptic gauze and delay the opening of the abscess for a couple of days until adhesions have formed, and the pleural cavity has become entirely shut off. At the end of this time the abscess is to be opened in the manner recommended in the abdominal incision. . , • r^^cf^r^r^r In some rare cases the abscess in the liver occupies the posterior portion of the right lobe, and extends downwards and backwards into "le lumbar region.

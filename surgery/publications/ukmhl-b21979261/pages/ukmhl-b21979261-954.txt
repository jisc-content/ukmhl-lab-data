9i6 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS finally, it may be caused by inflammatory tliickening outside the gut, as in cases of pelvic cellulitis after labour. . , , • , The bowel above the stricture becomes distended; its muscular coat becomes hypertrophied, and the mucous membrane in the majority of cases ulcerated. Perforation may ensue, either into the peritoneal cavity, causing fatal peritonitis, or into the bladder or vagina, setting up recto- vesical or recto-vaginal fistula. • . r.. •„ Svmptoms.-The symptoms of non-malignant stricture are often in the earWages very obscure. There is usually constipation and straining in defSLn; or in many cases constipation alternating with diarrhoea; he dScea being caused by catarrhal inflammation, set up by retained !^ees The motions are usually pellet-shaped or tape-hke, but this must not be regarded as a characteristic symptom, as such a condition is often nresent where there is no stricture, and in those cases where the stricture is K gh upfweU-formed motion may be passed, because the fecal mass has time to form after it has passed through the stenosed PO'-tio" ° f ^- those cases where the stricture is low down and within reach of the finger^ tie diagnosis is at once made by digital examination.

564 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES extension can be made by means of an accumulator so as to maintain the m-oper length of the limb. Gant's operation must be performed in those cases where there has been considerable destruction of bone, so that the neck is stunted and has practically disappeared ; or when it is^ much hkkened bv the formation of new bone between the trochanter and ilium. A mn-ow bl'aded scalpel is introduced on the outer surface of the femur L iXv thfgreat tlochanter, and is carried downwards to the extent o ibou an inch, severing all the structures to the bone. The bone is divided tith an osteotome, or saw, and put up in the straight position. _ " occasionally cases of ankylosis of both hips are "^^-'ilM-f^ucmg th^^ condition of cross- or scissor-legged deformity (fig. 202). The li^bs, under conuiuuuu ^^^^^ circumstances, are strongly rotated out- wards. The treatment is the same as for anky- losis of one hip. Osteo-arthritis is of common occurrence in the hip joint, and is said to be more frequendy met with in the male than in the female. There is nothing peculiar about the condition, as it occurs in the hip, to require separate consideration. Tuberculous disease of the hip is constantly met with, especially among the children of the poor. , • • , • Pathology.—The disease may begin either in the bone or the synovial membrane, but it would seem probable that the disease begins much more frequently in the former than in the latter situa- tion. When it commences in the bone, the part first attacked, in the majority of cases, is the (^rowing tissue at the end of the shaft in the neighbourhood of the epiphysial cartilage, but m some instances it would appear to commence in the growing bone in the centre of the epiphysis ; and, again, in other cases it begins in the aceta- bulum in the embryonic tissue in the neighbour- hood of the Y-shaped cartilage. When the disease commences m the neck ot the bone, iii the neighbourhood of the epiphysial cartilage, the joint speedily becomes'implicated ; for this cartilage ^^^s within the capsul^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the morbid process spreads along its under surface and ^.aP^dl> in ades^^^ joint, and the synovial membrane becomes secondarily involved, and pulp) degeneration is set up. c^rlr-ndv In some few cases, however, the joint does not become ^^J^^^^^^ affected. The tuberculous deposit on the under surface of the eP'Physwi cartilage slowly caseates and forms a chronic abscess in the end ot t ie shaft. This gradually increases and approaches the anterior surface^^^^^^^^ neck of the bone ; but before it perforates it, adhesion of the t^^o surtacc. of die synovial membrane-that covering the neck of the bone and tha lin ng th capsule-takes place, and the abscess finds its way through thes two layers without implicating the joint generally. It ^^^^y then point exterSlly, and when opened the abscess will be found to ex end m o a carious cavity in the neck of the bone without involving the joint. 1 ese S e° ai', ho'wever, very rare, and in the majority speedy implic^t^^^^ the joint follows the deposit of tubercle in the neck of the bone.

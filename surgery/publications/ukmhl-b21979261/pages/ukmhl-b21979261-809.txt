TREATMENT OF SPINAL CARIES 771 either end to the sides of the bed. A loose webbing is passed under the ath on either side, and through this the arm is inserted, so that it lies loosely over the fronts of the shoulders. This prevents the child raising Itself but It is no restraint to the movement of the arms. Another question which will present itself to the consideration of the surgeon is whether extension is necessary. In the great majority of cases I believe It IS not except m disease of the cervical spine ; but in those cases where the fixed pain m the back is not relieved by confinement to bed in a week or ten days, it is necessary. It can be applied by fixing the'head to the top of the bed by two straps, one passed under the chin and the other below the occiput, and then making extension by weights attached to the legs and passing over pulleys fixed to the foot of the bed (fir2Q0 The amount of weight required is about one pound for every year of age for a child'° °' ^eq^i^ed A most excellent contrivance for carrying out this treatment is Phelp's thP In T! ^'T^^'? ^'^y '"'^ ^bout six inches deep At the lov^^r end it is divided into two compartments, one for either owe extremity, and in it is a suitable apparatus for the passage of the excrm into a receptacle fixed beneath. This is carefully padded, and the child placed in it and fixed by suitable webbings, and then padding is placed between the child and the sides of the box so as to fill up all the interstices. In this way the patient's trunk is completely immobilised. The box can stand on trestles, can be carried from room to room, or into the ,open air, or placed in a carriage. Extension can be made, if necessary, by elastic cords attached above and below to the ends of the box. In quite young children the spine may be immobilised by a double Thomas's splint, into which the child is fixed, and in which he can be earned about m the arms of the nurse. The important question to decide is how long this treatment is to be carried on ; and the answer to this IS that, m all probability, in a well-pronounced case the treatment should be persevered in for twelve months This in the better class of patients can generally be managed, but in poorer people it is not so easy. Among the children of the poor it IS often inipossible to keep a child lying in bed at home for this long period of time, because there is W°fi [°°'' ^""^ cannot be kept in hospital, where the beds are required for more pain has subsided and, in the opinion of the surgeon ?Sed'to tT'^v^'^'^'u^' ^ "Sid jacket of some light material should trochanter i^^i • " '° ^'""^ ^^^'^^ ^-^^^l °f ^he fixed on h ^ -'Pf dorsal or lumbar region and be doml o; cer"4?r"^'^ ^-^7^^^^ ^^-P^- If ^he disease isKe upper iur> r;ast (fig S^^T^ ""'-T' ''?^^^^°"' P^^^'^ded widfa ['lastic fl t^ Ut^phsteT of pf J ''''^ '° make these jackets of is poro- tir, out plaster of Pans is more economical, and though heavier, 3 D 2 Fig. 296.—Jury mast in cases of disease of the cervical vertebrce.

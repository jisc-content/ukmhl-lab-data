DISEASES OF THE LOWER JAW 677 In cases of epulis the alveolar process, or a part of it, only requires removal, and this may be done either from the mouth without external incision, or by division of the hp in the middle line. When the lower part of the bone requires removal, it may be done by dividing the lip in the middle line and carrying the incision around the ala of the nose, separating it from the bone. By dissecting up the flap of cheek, the lower part of the bone can be exposed and removed by a horizontal saw cut. If the whole of the P^^'^ requires removal, the external incisions should be the same as those for the removal of the whole bone, and after division of the alveolus and palate a saw cut is made from the anterior nares across the bone, just below the infra-orbital foramen, and the lower part of the bone removed. DISEASES OF THE LOWER JAW Tumours of the lower jaw, like those of the upper, may be either cystic : I 7'*'''. • dental cysts, which are similar to those found in the upper jaw; (2) the dentigerous cysts, which, though occasionally found in the upper jaw, are much more common m the lower. They arise from imperfectly developed teeth, which have been retamed in the jaw. A tooth during development becomes displaced, very often horizontally, so that it cannot erupt, and a cavity develops around it, which expands the bone (fig. 260) The cvst ^ contains clear fluid, is lined by ^ ^ A ^ne cyst epithelium, and a more or less developed tooth is found gene- rally embedded in the wall of the cavity (fig. 257). Sometimes more than one tooth is present. They are usually met with in young people, but may occur later in life. At first the tumour is hard and feels solid, but as the bone expands it becomes thinned, and then egg-shell crackling may be perceived, and later on true fluctuation. On examining the denture one of the permanent teeth will be found missing from the series, ™SLn"L^' ."v f having been extracted. Occasionally nf r ^ Pu^''^!"

And finally some of the cases of perforated fracture are incomplete, when the perforation has not completely traversed the bone. , , , r j (7) Pe7-forated fractures are those cases where a bone has been perforated by a sharp-pointed instrument or a bullet, corresponding to a punctured wound of the soft parts. These fractures may be complete or mcomplete, but are all necessarily compound. Varieties as regards direction.—The direction which a fracture assumes is very various, and depends in a great measure upon the cause that gave rise to it. It may be transverse, oblique, longitudinal, spiral, T-shaped or stellate, names which sufficiently explain themselves. It should be remembered, however, that these forms are not always exactly defined, but that one may merge into another. Thus, a transverse fracture is not always strictly transverse, but may have a certain amount of obliquity; so that in speaking of a fracture as being transverse, oblique, and so on, we merely infer that this is the general direction of the line of fracture. Transverse fractures occur chiefly in children, from direct violence, generally at the ends of the long bones. There is often Uttle displace- ment, and they unite readily. Oblique fractures occur from indirect violence.

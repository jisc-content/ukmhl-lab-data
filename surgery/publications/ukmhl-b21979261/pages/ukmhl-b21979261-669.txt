Syphilitic lesions of the lip.—Primary sores are not uncommon on the hps, bemg caused by kissing an individual affected with syphilitic stomatitis, or using the same drinking-cup or pipe. The main point in connection with these sores as they are found on the lips is that they, as a rule, do not present the same typical induration which an Hunter'ian chancre on the genital organs presents (fig. 38). There is usually swelling and widespread mfiltration of the whole lip, and the neighbouring lymphatic glands are early affected. The condition is one, therefore, which is very liable to be mistaken for epithelioma. The diagnosis may be made by attention to the following points Chancre may occur at any age, but epithelioma is a disease of advanced iite ; a chancre develops rapidly, an epithelioma slowly, on the top of some antecedent condition, as an abrasion, wart, &c. The chancre presents a smoother surface than the irregular excavated outline of epithelioma It is usually painless; epithelioma often very painful. The enlargement of the glands is different in the two conditions : in chancre of the Hp a crop of glands becomes enlarged all at the same time, shortly after the appearance ot the sore ; whereas m epithehoma a single gland becomes first enlarged and this IS followed by another, but the enlargement does not begin for some time after the epithelioma has commenced. In addition to these signs the advent of secondaries and the influence of remedies will at once establish the diagnosis. In secondary syphilis, mucous plaques are frequendy met with on the hps; and in tertiary syphilis, in addition to the diffuse enlargement already alluded to, gummata, circumscribed in character, are occasionally met with in tne lips. ^ ..ii^^^*^®^^®™,*-,^-^?'^^^'^""'^ ^^P is always of the squamous- celled variety, and, like many other forms of this disease, begins at the nf^i'"" 1 surfaces, as the result of some irritation Ut these, the most common cause would appear to be the irritation excited Dy smoking a clay pipe; hence the disease is much more frequently met with in men than m women. It n / is said to be often seen among the labouring class of women in Glasgow, who are much addicted to smoking. Epithelioma also .not infrequently attacks warty growths on the Up when they are irritated. These growths are common in this situation, and should always be removed, on account of this tendency that they have to become epithelio- matous. Fig. 247. - Epithelioma of the lip.

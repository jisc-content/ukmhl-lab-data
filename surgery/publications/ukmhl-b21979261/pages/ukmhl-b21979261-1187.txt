THROUGH THE ANKLE JOINT 1149 surface until the tendo Achillis is reached. The anterior flap is then formed by makino- an incision, somewhat convex forwards, from one extremity ot tne first incision to the other. This flap is dissected up and the ankle joint opened ; the anterior and lateral ligaments are divided, and by the divisi_on of a few fibrous connections and the tendo Achillis, the foot is removed. Ihe lower end of the tibia and fibula is now cleared and sawn off. If the amputation is for injury and the ankle joint is healthy, it will be sufficient to saw off the tw o malleoli, leaving the articular cartilage on the inferior surface of the tibia • but if there is any disease in the ankle joint, a thm horizontal Fig. 439.— Lines of incision in various amputations of the foot.

In dissecting back the posterior flap, great care must be observed, by keeping the edge of the knife directed towards the bone, not to score it, otherwise the flap will be in danger of sloughing, a catastrophe which has sometimes happened, but which may always be avoided by care. Many surgeons prefer to reverse the order of proceeding, and no doubt by this means the operation is rendered easier. The flaps are first mapped out ; the anterior one is then made, the ioint opened and disarticulation performed ; the os calcis is then dissected out of the heel flap from above. In this way the difficulty of dissecting the posterior flap round the heel is avoided.

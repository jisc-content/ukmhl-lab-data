846 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS tube' are known together as the intiissusceptum. The upper portion of the bowel is invariably invaginated into the lower. In intussusception of the small intestine into the large (ileo-colic intussusception) the invagina- tion increases at the expense of the entering tube or small intestine. In all other forms of intussusception the invagination increases at the expense of the receiving tube; the line of reflection between the entering and reflected tubes remaining the same, whatever the length of the intus- susceptum. Anatomically there are four varieties of intussusception. The most common variety is the ileo-caecal (44 per cent, of all cases), where the ileum and caecum prolapse into the colon, preceded by the ileo-csecal valve which forms the apex of the intussusceptum. This variety increases at the expense of the receiving tube. The next most frequent variety is the enteric (30 per cent.), where one portion of the small intestme is invaginated into another. These intussusceptions are usually in the ileum, and are generally small. The third variety is the colic (18 per cent.), where one portion of the large intestine is invaginated into another portion of the same. This form may be found in any part of the large gut, but is most frequently situated in the sigmoid flexure. The most uncommon form is the ileo-colic (8 per cent.), where the end of the ileum prolapses through the ileo-c£ecal valve. In these cases the valve retains its normal position, and more and more ileum is protruded through, so that the mcrease is at the expense of the entering tube. But this at last ceases; after a time no more ileum can protrude, and then if any further increase takes place it is, as in the other forms, at the expense of the receiving tube. The effects of an intussusception are first of all obstruction, though this may not be complete ; this is brought about by the narrowing of the lumen ot the tube from congestion of the wall, and from traction of the mesentery, which curves and partially kinks the prolapsed gut. The narrowed tube may also become blocked by a portion of undigested food or by blood clot Secondly, the vessels in the mesentery, which is carried along with the gut when it becomes invaginated, become constricted, and the passage of blood through them is arrested, so that the intussusceptum becomes strangulated and eventually gangrenous. Under these circumstances the whole of the intussusceptum may perish, separate at the point of I'^^^S^'^^tion, and be discharged per anum, and in this way a spontaneous ^^re may be brougit about. The cases, however, in which this has occurred, and m which recovery has taken place, are very rai;e ; before it can t^^^/^^^^'f cases a diffuse peritonitis is set up from the passage of the bacillus coU communis through the damaged coats of the gut, and causes the death 0 the patient; and even if separation does occur, and the gangrenous mass 1 got rid of, stricture is likely to supervene. In those cases where a general peritonitis does not supervene and destroy the patient a limited pento S may be set up, and may glue together the ^^rous surfaces 0 the entering and reflected layers, and thus lead to irreducibility of the intus ''''SympJoms of acute intestinal obstruction.-The •7'^^P^°"^V°SThe to an foi-ms of intestinal obstruction _ are as ^-'^]--^^^ patient is seized quite suddenly with intense pain ^ ^^^i^^lf train- ' doubles him up,' perhaps while making some musculai effo. t as n sc ing at stool or iStii^g a heavy weight, ^1^;, ^^X^T^^^^ tion as if ' something had given way or ^hljed out of Pla^^^ access of pain is sometimes associated with vomi ng he eontcn _ stomach being at once rejected.

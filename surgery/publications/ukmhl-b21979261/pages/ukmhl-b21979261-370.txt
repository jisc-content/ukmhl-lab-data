344 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES aneurism of the first part of the artery may also press on the trachea and cesonhatius, producing dyspnc^a and dysphagia. ffilaviL aneurilm his a tendency to become diffused, when it loses its defined character, increases rapidly, and may burst externally or mto the nleural cavity or trachea. . . . . Treatmeiit.-The treatment of subclavian aneunsm is very unsatis- factory The ordinary measures for treating these aneurisms by proximal factory. ne uil ^ compression or ligature are scarcely available in these cases, since liga- ture of the first part of the sub- clavian is never successful and ligature of the innominate only very rarely so, and there are few cases where proximal pressure can be applied ; so that unless the aneurism is situated so low down on the artery that it partakes more of the character of a subclavio- axillary aneurism, so that a ligature can be placed on the second part of the vessel, which is rarely the case, the treatment by proximal ligature has to be abandoned. The other means of treating aneurism, by manipulation, galvano-puncture, &c., have been tried, and though cases here and there have been recorded where it has been success- ful, there are many more in which Fig. io6.—a subclavian aneurism of large size.

The best mode of proceeding in the treatment of subclavian aneurism would appear to be, ii. the first instance, to give a steady and cSnr ll to con^stitutional treatment by rest, attention to die and medicine, and by combining with this direct pressure over the aneunsm by "Tt°his%aiira taiure should be placed on the proximal side of the aneurism if there is sufficient room to ligature the second part of the visel o'r in cases of right subclavian aneurism of larger size it may be proper to apply a ligature to the mnominate artery.

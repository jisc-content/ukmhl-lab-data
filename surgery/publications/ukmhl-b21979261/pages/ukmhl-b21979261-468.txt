442 INJURIES AN J) DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES In consequence of this the angle which the neck forms with the shaft more nearly approaches a nght angle, and there is therefore greater strain on °he neck of he bone m supporting the weight of the trunk.

The limb is shortened and rests on its outer side, with the knee somewhat flexed, and there is a general appearance of deformity and flattening about the hip The principal signs are: (i) alteration in the .shape of the hip: (2) alteration in the direction of the axis of the Hmb; (3) shortening/(4) pain; (5) possibly crepitus ; (6) loss of power. ^ Alteration in the shape of the limb is due to alteration in the position of the trochanter major, which is displaced upwards and inwards and sunken, so that it does not appear to be as prominent as natural. On rotating the thigh, it does not describe the segment of a circle, as it does on an uninjured limb, but simply rotates under the finger. The alteration which IS noticed in the direction of the axis of the limb is that the shaft ot the bone is everted and rotated outwards, so that the limb rests on its outer side in an apparently helpless condition. The shortening is never very great, rarely exceeding an inch, the amount of shortening depending

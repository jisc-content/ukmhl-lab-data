LIGATURE OF THE EXTERNAL ILIAC 353 in some cases is pressure on the distal side of the aneurism, and though possibly further evidence is required before absolutely abandoning this plan, the experience hitherto gained does not hold out much hope of its proving of any use. Inguinal aneurisms are aneurisms which are situated in the groin, and which most frequently implicate both the external iliac and the common teaioral artery, consisting of an hour-glass-shaped sac, with a constriction at 1 oupart's ligament. The aneurism often presents slight symptoms at first, forming a small pulsating tumour in the groin, which causes little inconvenience. It may attain considerable size, forming a large sac in the ihac fossa without causing much swelling externally, where the artery IS supported by the strong fascia lata. After a time it begins to produce serious pressure symptoms, oedema of the leg from pressure on the temoral vein, and pain down the leg and in the scrotum from pressure on the anterior crural and genito-crural nerves. Inguinal aneurisms frequently become much solidified, and this makes the diagnosis very often difficult as the pulsation in them may become very feeble or cease altogether. They may be mistaken for abscess, enlarged glands, and sarcoma in the groin Ihe diagnosis must be made on general principles, but in many cases is surrounded with difficulty, especially as regards the diagnosis between a pulsating sarcoma and a partially solidified aneurism. The treatment of inguinal aneurism must vary according to the nature of the case. In all instances a trial should first be given to rest and constitutional treatment; and as inguinal aneurisms show a great tendency to consolidation, this plan of treatment would appear to hold out more prospect of success in this situation than in almost any other Combined with the "constitutional means, direct pressure on the sac mav be resorted to. Failing this, the next resource is ligature. If the aneurisni does not extend far up the external iliac artery, this vessel may be hgatured, otherwise it will be necessary to tie the common iliac But in some cases the aneurism extends too high to permit of ligature of even the common iliac. The surgeon has then three alternatives : fi) to apply instrumental compression to the abdominal aorta just above its bifurcation ; (2) to tie the abdominal aorta; and (3) to resort to galvano- puncture or some other means of inducing coagulation in the sac If the patient IS not very fat, and the aneurism does not encroach upon the bifurcation o the aorta, the first of these three measures should be tried The probabilities of a successful issue are not, however, very g eat" Hml'"^ f ^'^d^"^'"^! ^"^ta has been tied at least seven or dght imes without success, it would seem that the patient has a better prospic [;S^;»t hS^iS TSTLJ'^'''' wav^'iif ^^licT th5 l^.^ «^*ernal iliac (fig. io9).-There are several S the fi st to He tS^^^^^^^ Abernethy, who was tne nrst to tie this vessel, in his original operation, made an in SonTthrclrtof'S" ^^^rn^'S-ent, Upwards' and inward , along the course of the vessel; but subsequently modified it and made a aS^v aler'mnT" '''' ^'^"^ ^P°' "P^-''^^ outward^ Sir itrmai?

The ascending colon is sometimes the seat '■ of volvulus; this occurs when there is congenitally an elon- gated meso-colon (fig. 335). Volvulus of the small intestine is usually due to the violence of the peristaltic movements in an acute attack of biliary colic, or from the presence of a gall stone in the intestinal tube, causing violent expulsive efforts. 3. Stricture. — Stricture of the intestine may sometimes be a cause of acute intestinal obstruction. There is a gradual narrowing of the tube from some malignant growth or cica- tricial contraction, which may give rise to the symptoms enu- merated above (page 838), and then sudden symptoms of acute obstruction come on, which can- not be relieved by medicine. These are due to the impaction of a fsecal mass in the narrowed part, or to some bend or kink Fig. 335.—Volvulus of ascending colon.

These bands may be formed in several ways : (a) they may be old adhesions, the result of former per onitis (fig. 33^)' they are composed of fibrous tissue, are often of considerable length and in many cases there is only a single band; in X cases they are multiple. The manner m which they originate is a follows: first there is a local peritonitis, caused by a tuberculous or typhoid ulcer; inflammation of a mesenteric gland; appendicitis; or iCry : as a result of this, adhesion takes place between two coi s of ntestiAe, or between a coil of intestine and some other viscus or of the band.

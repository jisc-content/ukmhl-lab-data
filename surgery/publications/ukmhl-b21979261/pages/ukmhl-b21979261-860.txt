The opening in the meso-colon may now be brought together with one or two fine catgut or silk sutures, the peritoneum cleansed, and the external wound closed. When in the performance of the operation time is of essential importance, anastomosis by Senn's plates or Murphy's buttons should be resorted to. . , .

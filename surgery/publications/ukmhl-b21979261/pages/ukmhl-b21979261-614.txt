588 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS base oLthe skull where no fissure can be found radiating from the point striiclc • " Tlie dangers from fracture of the base of the skull do not arise from the fracture%f/- se, but from the concomitant cerebral mjury, either laceration or pressure from extravasated blood, or from the risk of septic meningitis being set up, as most of these fractures are compound. Ihose in the anterior fossa are rendered compound when there is a perforating wound through the orbit; or when the fracture runs across the cribriform nlate of the ethmoid, and the soft structures covering its nasal surface are lacerated • or when the frontal or ethmoidal sinuses are opened. _ Fractures n the middle fossa are compound when the tympanic cavity is involved and the membrana tympani ruptured, or the fracture runs across the pi^tuitary fossa, and the naso-pharynx is opened. Fractures in the posterior fossa aie not usually compound, unless they extend across the basilar pro- cess of the occipital bone, and open up the roof of the pharynx. Symptoins.lln describing the signs of fracture of the base o the skull it will be convenient for purposes of description to aUude to them as they occur in the anterior, middle and postenor fossa, respectively. And we shall commence first with those in the middle fossa, as this is by he most frequent situation in which the fracture occurs. Before doing so however, it is necessary to mention that any injury sufficiently sevel to cause a' fracture of the base will be severe enough to cause njury tothe cranial contents, and therefore m "^^f ^ ^^^f.^ ^^ere are the of concussion, and in some of compression or laceration of the bran . Cases do however, occasionally occur in which, though there is undoubt- edly a fracture of the base, there is no evidence of any cranial injury.

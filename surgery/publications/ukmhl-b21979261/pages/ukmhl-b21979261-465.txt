Left side. deformity. This in all cases may not be possible but in the majority of them by flexing the forearm and making forcible extension, with t e hand supinated and adducted, the deformity will be overcome Gentle massage in an upward direction should then be performed until the pam is dfeved and the Umb should be confined on a couple of ordinary splints palmar and dorsal. The massage should be repeated daily, and at he end Sf a week passive movements of the various jomts of the fingers and the wrist be begun, the splints being reapplied after each sittmg. At the end of a fortnight the splints may be discarded, the arm being carried in a sling and at the end of a month the bones will be found fairly united, and there will be perfect movement of the joints in every direction. Many different forms of splint have been employed m the treatment ot this form of fracture, such as Nekton's pistol-shaped splint; Gordons splint • Carr's splint; and two straight splints, not extending beyond the knuckles, so that the weight of the hand keeps up a condition of adduc- tion It will be sufficient to describe here Carr's splint, which is certainly the best and the one most commonly used. The shape of the splint will be readily understood from the accompanying illustration (fig. 149)- consists of a narrow splint hollowed out for the thenar eminence, to the end of which is attached an oblique rod about four inches long. This is applied to the palmar surface of the forearm, so that the rod corresponds to the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, and is grasped by the fingers. A second short splint is applied to the dorsal surface. These splints are fixed by strapping in such a way that the fingers are free to move. . I'here is another variety of fracture of the lower end of the radius, in

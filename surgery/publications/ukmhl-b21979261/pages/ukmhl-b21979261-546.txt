520 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES popliteal vessels and arrest the circulation through them. In many in- stances of this form of dislocation there is lateral displacement as well. The dislocation backwards (fig. 187) may be complete or incomplete. In the complete form the displacement of the bones is not so great as in the forward dislocation, and injury to or compression of the vessels in the ham does not so frequently occur. The anterior border of the tuberosities of the tibia rests against the posterior surface of the condyles, and the shortening is not so much as in the other variety. The lateral displacements are much more common than the antero-posterior. They are always incomplete, and are generally accom- FlG. 187.—Skiagraph showing dislocation of the knee. panied by a certain degree of rotation. In these dislocations the articular surface of the outer tuberosity rests on the internal condyle, or the articular surface of the inner tuberosity rests on the external condyle, according as the displacement is inwards or outwards. Symptoms.—There is no difficulty in diagnosing these accidents, as the nature of the case is apparent at a glance, and the displaced bone can usually be easily felt in its new position. There is generally a very considerable amount of swelling and bruising about the knee. In the antero-posterior displacements attention must be paid to the circulation below, to ascertain whether the vessels have been injured or compressed.

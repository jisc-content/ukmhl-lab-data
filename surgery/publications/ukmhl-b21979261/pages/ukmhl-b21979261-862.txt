824 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS should be about half an inch apart (fig. 321, a). An incision, about two-thirds the diameter of the button, is to be made mto the bowel, midway between the two rows of suture, and the male half of the button introduced mto the gut through this opening in such a way that the end of the central hollow cylinder protrudes ; the running thread is now to be tensed and tied around the central tube. A similar proceeding is earned out on the posterior surface of the stomach, and the female half of the button intro- duced and secured. The two halves of the button are then approximated and closed (fig. 321, b). , . , r .u . u ^-Ko^ When the cancer is situated in other parts of the stomach than the nvlorus it may be right to consider the feasibility of removmg the whole or part'of the stomach. In one case recently the whole of the stomach including the cardiac and pyloric orifices, was removed by Dr. Larl Schlatter of Zurich with success, and eleven weeks afterwards the_ patient was out of bed and at work all day long, and took with few exceptions the ordinary diet of the patients. > She had gained in weight eleven pounds since the operation. . . i j Gastric fistula.—An artificial communication may be made between the stomach and the surface of the body, as the result of iniurv generally gunshot wounds ; from cancer of the stomach, or perhaps rarely after simple ulceration. Where it is due to non-malignant cancer, an attempt should be made to close the opening, The abdomen must be opened over the site of the fistula, and the stomach separated from he abdominal wall. The cicatricial tissue around the fistulous opening in the stomach is to be cutaway, and the rawed edges sutured with a Czerny- 1 embert suture. The soft parts around the cutaneous opening.are now excised, and the wound in the abdominal wall closed. There are one or two other operations on the stomach which require mention. In some cases of largely dilated stomach it has been proposed to fold in a tuck of the stomach wall, and unite the edges of the tuck together, so as to diminish the size of the organ. This operation is not likely to come much into vogue, for it is difficult to -(^^.rstand how dilatation of the stomach can occur except as the result of p> lone stenosis ; and as the adoption of this operation is treating a sympton rather than the cause of the symptom, ^e. endeavours of the should be directed to removing the stenosis by one of the ^^a) indi cated above. Secondly, an operation is sometimes performed for reeing adhesions which have formed between the stomach and parietal pen^ toneum. These adhesions, the result of a f^f.^^^" P^'-^t^"^^^^',^^^,,f be the cause of very severe pain and gastric disturbance, which ma) oe entirely relieved bj opening ?he abdomen and dividing them between two ligatures.

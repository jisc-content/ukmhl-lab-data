9o6 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS motion or the result of dirt &c. In consequence of the constant action of the sphincter and the lodgment of particles of faeces m the basin of the ulcer a continued irritation is kept up, and the sore is prevented from heiliiV Ball of Dublin believes, however, that they are formed in another way *At the point where the hind gut joins the involuted epiblast in the nrocess of development, are to be seen a number of muco-cutaneous folds, called the ami/ valves. Ball believes that one of these folds is torn from its upper connections during the passage of a motion. At each subse- quent motion, the little sore thus made is reopened and the fold is torn a little further down, until it appears at the anal orifice and constitutes the little ta-^ of skin which is usually to be seen just outside the anus in these cases indicating the position of the fissure, and sometimes known as the sentinel pile. In whichever of these two ways the fissure is formed it will generally be found that they only occur in individuals who are debih- tated or broken down in health. They are more common in women than in men and especially women who are of weakly constitutions. Symptoms.—The symptoms of this condition are very distressing and sufficiendy characteristic. The patient complains of a severe, burmng pain, either coming on during or shortly after the passage of a motion The pain is situated within the anus, and usually radiates from this point down the thighs, and upwards to the sacro-iliac joint. It lasts for some time and then somewhat suddenly disappears, only to return upon the next act of defcEcation. The severe pain excited by the passage of a motion causes the patient to refrain from defsecating as long as possible, and sometimes from taking food. The constant pain and irritation, conjoined with the irregular action of the bowels and the insufficient food, causes the patient to become emaciated and debilitated; his counte- nance is pale, anxious, and careworn, and the nervous system general y sympathises with the local mischief. There is often very considerable irritation of the genito-urinary organs : in the male, constant desire to micturate, often without the ability to do so, and nocturnal emissions; m the female, symptoms of uterine irritation. Frequently a trace of blood or pus will be passed with the faeces. Upon examination, a small single tag of skin, the sentinel pile, will be seen ; and on the under surface of this, the ulcer will be discovered looking like a little crack, until the anal folds are separated, when it will present the appearance of an excavated ulcerated surface, with somewhat indurated edges ^ extremely painful, and the sphincter muscle will be found to be in a state of spasmodic contraction. _ , . , , r „f o,-,,,.: Treatment.—There are several ways in which these fissures of the anus may be treated.

Occasionally suicidal wounds may be punctured, made with the object of perforating some important vessel. The wound may be inflicted at any part of the neck, from the lower jaw to the top of the sternum; but by far the commonest situation is somewhere in the neigh- bourhood of the pomum Adami, either dividing the thyro-hyoid membrane or the upper part of the thyroid cartilage (fig. 266). When the wound is inflicted in this situation the main vessels of the neck generally escape injury, though the superior thyroid and lingual vessels may be divided The head is thrown back to render the larynx prominent, and thus the vessels are guarded by the tension of the sterno-mastoid muscles. Cut-throat wounds which do not extend into the air passages are much less dangerous than those which do. But nevertheless this class of wound is not always devoid of danger; for in addition to the risk that there is, when the wound is low down in the neck, of the admission of air into some severed vein, there is also the risk of very severe and fatal hjemorrhage, even though none of the large vessels of the neck have been wounded, from the venous plexuses or from the thyroid body, when it has been involved in the injury. A still more common source of danger IS diffuse cellulitis of the neck, which is apt to be set up in these cases, and is especially dangerous because the suicide is generally a man of intemperate habits, has passed the middle period of life, and is often in a very despondent frame of mind, and therefore in a very unfavour- able condition for repair. In superficial wounds, after all hfemorrhage has been arrested, careful cleansing and dis- infection should be carried out, and the wound should be accurately sutured and dressed anti- septically, care being taken to immobilise the neck as far as possible. Cut-throat wounds which implicate the air passages may be at once diagnosed by the air being heard to bubble in and out of the wound passages is small. Generally it is of large size, and then the condition of things will be abundantly evident The Gangers which may arise from such a wound are several.

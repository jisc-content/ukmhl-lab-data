It.serves to d7mS the local congestion of an inflamed part, but the way in which irdoes his IS not quite clear ; it can scarcely be due to the effect produced by the abstraction of blood from the inflamed part, for sometimes^the application of a single leech, which cannot be expected to abstract at the mos more than half an ounce of blood, will produce a very appreciable reTul o^A^ congestion of an inflamed part.

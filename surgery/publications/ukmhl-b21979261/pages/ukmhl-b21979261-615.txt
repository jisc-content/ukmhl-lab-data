FRACTURES OF THE BASE OF THE SKULL 589 blood has found its way from this into the naso-pharynx. Most of the blood poured out in this way trickles down the pharynx and oesophagus into the stomach, from which it is after a time expelled by vomiting ; so that the amount of bleeding from the nose is usually slight. 2. The escape of cerebro-spinal fluid from the external auditory meatus is not a constant, but when present is a most characteristic sign of fracture of the middle fossa. It indicates that the arachnoid has been torn, and the portion of this membrane which usually suffers is the prolongation around the facial and auditory nerves as they lie in the internal auditory meatus when the fracture runs across this canal. The fluid may be mis- taken for the liquor Cotunnii, or for serous exudation in cases where Fig. 217.â€”The base of the skull, showing the route usually taken l)y a fracture of the middle fossa. inflammation of the middle ear has been set up; but the fluid in these cases is usually small in amount, whereas the pouring out of cerebro-spinal fluid may amount to ounces. Its true nature can be readily ascertained, since it contains a substance resembling grape sugar in giving a brick-dust precipitate when boiled with cupric oxide. Occasionally, in very severe fractures, small portions of brain matter may escape from the external auditory meatus. When this occurs it is absolutely diagnostic of fracture of the base. 3. In fracture of the middle fossa of the base of the skull there are often signs of paralysis of the muscles of expression and deafness on the affected side, from injury to the facial and auditory nerves as they lie in

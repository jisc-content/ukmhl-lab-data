48 GENERAL INJURIES cavities are frequently surrounded by a wall formed of blood clot and condensed tissue, and under these circumstances present a hard circum scribed border, with a soft, fluctuating centre. When such a hfcmatoma occurs on the scalp, it is liable to be mistaken for depressed bone • the hard abrupt border of the circumscribing clot feeling like the hard edge of a broken bone. Haematomata are frequently mistaken for chronic abscess or for malignant disease, but the history of the case and the occurrence of the swelling immediately after the accident, together with the absence of the other signs of inflammation, are sufficient to establish the diagnosis from abscess, whilst the stationary nature of the swelling instead of the progressive increase of malignant disease, should at once diff-erentiate it from this condition. Should any doubt exist, exploration with an exolorin^ syringe or a grooved needle and examination under the microscope will at once clear up the matter. ^ (3) In some instances the contusion is so severe as to lead to the de struction of the vitality of the part and to the occurrence of sloughing' and under these circumstances, unless care is taken to maintain nerfect asepticity, we may have profuse suppuration, with throwing off" of sloughs of cellular tissue and, it may be, destruction of muscles aiid even vessels when fatal haemorrhage may occur. In some instances of contusion from crushing force or great violence, we may have the vitality of a whole limb destroyed then it falls into a state of rapid gangrene, without the skin bS broken : this is especially the case where the main artery of the limb "f injured and where the eff-used blood which is poured out from it presses on the other vessels and prevents a collateral circulation being set up lreatment.-l here are two indications to be followed in the treatment of contusions. i) To prevent as far as possible the further extravasation of blood, and (2) to promote the absorption of the blood already effu ed of blo'od i?cold'" Tr"'' '"^^ f-^her extravasation, ot blood is cold.

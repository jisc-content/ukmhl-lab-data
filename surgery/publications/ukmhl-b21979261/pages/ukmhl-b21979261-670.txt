644 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORCIANS the Hd and deeply into its substance. As it spreads, it involves the mouth'and implicates the lower jaw. The submaxillary glands after a time break down and ulcerate, and the disease extends to the other glands in the neck, which cause large swellings in this situation. These after they have ulcerated, form large sloughy cavities, which give ris^e to foul discharge and frequently bleed. The repeated hiemorrhages and absorption of septic poisons from the growth cause death from exhaustion and toxemia. The disease rarely disseminates itself .in the viscera. Treatment —The only treatment for cancer of the hp is free and early removal This is usually best done by a V-shaped incision, cutting wide of the -rowth through healthy structures ; the edges of the cut are then united by hare-lip pins, with figure-of-8 suture or by silver wire sutures. In some cases, where the disease has spread principally along the free marein of the lip and has not implicated it to any very considerable denth it may be necessary to remove a slice of the hp and then suture the mucous and cutaneous surfaces together. When the glands are already enlarged, the advisability of operating must depend upon the amount of enlargement and the fixity of the growth. When the glands beneath the sterno-mastoid and around the big vessels have become involved, the case is beyond the reach of the surgeon ; but when the glands are confined to the submaxillary region, an attempt should be made to remove them if Epithelioma of the lip is a local disease and spreads solely by con- tinuity of tissue, and therefore the prognosis after thorough removal is a favourable one if the disease is removed in the early stage. As a rule, if fteely removed, it rarely returns ; but unfortunately it very often happens that it is not removed until the submaxillary glands have become mvdved, though they may not be sufficiently implicated to form definite swelhngs which can be detected through the skin. It is a ma ter of constant Txperience to see patients who apply for advice for a swelhng in the neck which proves to be a mass of malignant glands, by this time adherent and beyond^he reach of the knife, and with the history that they -d ^ore removed from the lip some months previously. The ^^^ffj^'^^^^ visible, sound, and without any evidence of recurrence. It seems to me Iherefore, tha the same rule should be applied in these cases as is adopted by most urgeons in removing a cancer of the breast, when it is the custom of most to clear out of the axilla all the lymphatic gl-"ds it contains, would sueeest that in every case in which a cancer is removed from the Tower hp fSe incision should be made in the submaxillary region, rem thrsymphysis of the jaw to the hyoid bone, and back to the sterno-mastoK^ and the whole contents of the submaxillary triangle removed. This would probably necessitate the division of the facial vessels.

735 SIMPLE BRONCHOCELE is due to the absence of iodine in the air or drinking water. At all events it is well known that iodine in combination with albumin is a constituent of the normal secretion of the thyroid body, and it has recently been dis- covered that it is absent in cases of bronchocele. If the absence of iodine is therefore the cause of the disease, the enlargement must be regarded as of a compensatory character. The disease is endemic, and in this country is most frequently found in the hilly parts of Derbyshire, hence its synonym, De?-byshire neck. It is very common in Switzerland. It occurs nmch more commonly in women than in men, and in the former is fre- quently larger during menstruation than at other times. Varieties.—The chief forms of bronchocele are : (i) the simple or paren- chymatous, (2) the fibrous, (3) the pulsating, (4) the cystic, and (5) the exophthalmic; but in addition to these we may get enlargement of the thyroid body from inflammation or from the growth in it of a tumour either innocent or malignant. I. Simple or parenchymatous bronchocele.—This may be 'considered as the type of the disease, and in it all the constituents of the Fig. 283. Enlargement of the thyroid gland. (From a photograph.)

There is no marked change in structure. The acini are slightly enlarged and contain a colloid material, and the fibrous stroma is increased in quantity ; the gland is larger than normal, and may sometimes attain a very considerable bulk (fig. 283). The whole gland is usually involved, but the enlargement may be confined to one lobe. The disease begins with slight fullness of the neck, so that the patient notices that she is unable to wear her ordinary collars. Then a

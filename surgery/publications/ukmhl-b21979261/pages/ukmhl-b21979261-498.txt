472 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES 2. Acute infective or septic osteo-myelitis presents itself under two different forms : (i) as a result of infection from without, e.g. in cases' of compound fracture and after amputation; and (2) as a result of infection from within, when it is closely related to and probably identical with acute septic periostitis, which has already been described. I. In the former class of cases there must be some injury exposing the marrow of bone and permitting the introduction of micro-organisms, pro- bably the staphylo- or strepto-cocci. The medullary membrane becomes injected, studded with ecchymoses, and very soon breaks down into suppuration, which first shows itself as little isolated abscesses, which after a time coalesce, and the whole of the medullary tissue is converted into Fig. 167.—Acute septic osteo-myelitis of the femur.

The circulation in the bone being cut off, it necroses, and, if the patient survive, a varying amount, according to the extent of the inflammation, separates. In cases of amputation this sequestrum is usually annular and conical in shape (fig. 168), a small portion of the whole thick- ness of the bone perishing below^ and only the interior of the bone above, and this becomes less and less in amount as the disease extends upwards. In these cases the patient runs considerable risk of septicnemia and pyaemia, from septic thrombi forming in the veins and becoming de- tached and carried into the circulation.

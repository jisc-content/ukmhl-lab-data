8o2 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS diminishing the lumen of the tube, {b) Intestines of unequal size can be more readily joined, {c) The opening can be made larger {d) The vascular supply at the seat of junction is better, for it is supplied by the vessels of the mesentery which encircle the gut, instead of the small vessels which supply just the portions of bowel joined together. The mode of performing lateral anastomosis will be described at a future ^^^Bnterorrhaphy by means of special apparatus.—Many different forms of apparatus have been invented for facilitating the junction of two pieces of intestine either by end-to-end or lateral anastomosis. Among these may be mentioned (a) Murphy's button; W Mayo- Robson's bobbin; {c) Paul's tube; {d) Alhngham's bobbinBall s bone ring; (/) Hayes' bobbin; {g) Senn's plates; {h) vegetable absorb- able plates (fig 311). It will be impossible to describe all these various special appliances, and it will probably be sufficient if we describe Murphy's button merely mentioning with regard to the others that they are all composed in whole or in part of decalcified bone, which causes no irritation to the mucous surface with which it is in contact, and becomes soft and pulpy in a few days and finally disappears. With regard to Paul s tube and Haves' bobbin the anastomosis is performed by a process of invagination, and the main object of this special appliance is to facilitate the introduction of one portion of the intestine into the other. ^ Vegetable absorbable plates are usually fashioned like Senns plate, and are cut out of a potato or a turnip. They have been strongly recom- mended by American surgeons, and certainly possess the advantage that they are easily procurable. They quickly soften and become absorbed when no longer needed. 1^ -pa^h Murphy's button consists of two parts, male and female, ^ach part consists of a central tube, through which the fluid contents of the intestine can pass when the instrument is in situ. To the end of each ot these tubes is attached a cup-shaped expansion. The male tube is rather smaller than the female, into which it can be inserted, and ^yhen this is done it is retained in position by a spring which catches against a screw thread with which the female tube is fined, so that the two portions can only be separated by unscrewing. The male expanded portion is htted with an inner flange, which is movable on the outer cup and is governed by a spiral spring, so that when the button is in position the roundea margins of the two cups are pressed closely together, and any tissue lying between them is subjected to pressure. _ mnning In performing end-to-end anastomosis with Murphy s button, a running thread is inserted along the excised edge in the manner shown in hg 312. It is begun at the part of the gut opposite the mesentery and camea 1 and out down to the mesentery. Here a return stitch is taken (see fig. oj^^h and the suture is then continued along the opposite side to the POi"t "° which the start was made. The button is inserted by Jf^ f of the central tube in a pair of clip forceps, and pushmg ^^.^ butt^ ^^^^^^ the lumen of the tube. The puckering string is then drawn ghtl ' arom the tube and tied, so that the bell-shaped expansion is ii clo^^^^^ the gut, and only the central tube projects. The other ha 0 button is introduced in the same manner and the two partsj (fig. 312). The walls of the gut are now pressed together bet^^ee mfrgins of the bell-shaped expansions, and pressure atroj^hy akes plac . and eventually the button is set free. Wh.le, however, this has

To88 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL 0R(;ANS the surface of the body, the skin becomes thinned and stretched over them,'' and eventually gives way; the capsule perforates, and a fungous mass —that is, the intra-cystic growth—sprouts through. This bleeds freely, grows rapidly, becomes offensive, and presents all the characteristics of a fungating mass of malignant disease. It can, however, be distinguished from it by the fact that the skin around the perforation, though thinned, is perfectly natural and not infiltrated by any new growth. These tumours are generally found to occur in women between the age of thirty and forty, and as a rule at an earlier period of life than carcinoma. They usually commence as firm, hard tumours (adeno- FiG. 405.—Large cyst of the breast, with papillomatous growths from its lining membrane. (From the Museum of St. George's Hospital.) fibroma), which grow slowly at first and then increase more rapidly in size ; one or more cysts taking on active growth until they may attain an enor- mous size. They are soft, and generally fluctuation can be detected in places over the most prominent cysts. They are lobulated and irregular in outline, owing to the jorojection of cysts. They are freely movable on surrounding structures, and the skin is not adherent to them. They are usually painless; there is no enlargement of the axillary glands and no retraction of the nipple. After fungation has occurred the growth is very rapid, and they speedily prove fatal from hfemorrhage and exhaustion, if not removed.

MENINGOCELE 613 \-entricle through an aperture in the skull in the fronto-nasal region (fig. 229). They correspond to the form of spina bifida known by the name of syringo-myelocele. Fig. 22S.—Meningocele. (From a cast in the Museum of St. George's Hospital.) The situation of these protrusions is almost always in the middle line, most commonly in the occipital and the naso-frontal region; but occasionally they protrude at the anterior fontanelle or at the base of Rare cases are recorded where they the skull, into the mouth or nose have protruded at the external angle of the orbit, or at one of the lateral fontanelles. When they occur in the occipital region, they generally protrude through the expanded portion of the occi- pital bone, behind the foramen magnum ; but in some cases the occipital bone is deficient in the middle line down to the foramen magnum, and even the arches of the first two cervical vertebree have been found to be deficient, and we have in these cases a transition to .spina bifida. The protrusion consi.sts simply of the membranes (meningocele), forming a .sac filled with clear fluid, which com- municates by a small opening in the bone with the sub-arachnoidean cavity. In some cases the interior of the sac is divided up into numerous locuh by septa (fig. 230). Symptoms.—These protrusions form roundish elastic tumours, which are often pedunculated and are congenital. They are usually covered by normal skin, which is often adherent to the surface of the tumour. A P'iG. 229.—An encephalocele in the fronto- nasal region.

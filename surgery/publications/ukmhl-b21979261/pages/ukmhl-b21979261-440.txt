414 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES osteoblasts, calcification takes place around them, and the tissue become, converted into bone. ^^^uma. Treatment of fractures.-The treatment of a simple fracture consists first of all in bringing the broken ends of the bone into as perfect anno sitioii as possible and secondly in preventing any recurrence of the d s" placement It will be convenient to consider the treatment under three heads: (i) The reduction of the fracture; (2) the prevention of the irn^ofthe'paSt ' constitutional treat- (i) The reduction of the fracture.-This should be attempted as soon as possible after the receipt of the injury, for several reasons In the firs place, immediately after the accident the patient is in a condition of shock and his muscles are relaxed and flabby, and offer no impedimen to he reduction, ^yherea.s after reaction has taken place the muscles are in a state of contraction, and a greater force is therefore required to overcome heir resistance. Secondly, if reduction has been delayed for a few davs he tissues around become infiltrated and matted together with inflammJ tory effusion, and thus reduction is prevented or a greater force has To be employed in orfer to effect it. Thirdly, so long Is the fracture is un reduced there is always a risk of the broken ends, especially if pointed perforating the skm, or from pressure causing sloughing,'^and .so producing a compound fracture, or the displaced bone may irritate and lacerLtf muscles and nerves and so mduce violent spasm. As a rule it is better to avoid the administration of an anaesthetic during the reduction, as a patient suffering from shock is not in the best possible condition to take an anaesthetic, and there is always a fear that while taking it he may bv his movements cause further damage to his injured limb ^ y ■ Reduction is effected usually by an assistant holding the limb above the fracture and making counter extension, while the surgeon grasps the bone below the fracture, and by making extension, combined if necessary with a slight lateral or swaying movement, he pulls the bone into its place Ihe manoeuvre should always be attempted with opposing muscles relaxed as tar as possible. Thus in the common fracture in the lower third of the leg the knee should always be flexed, in order to relax the gastrocnemius and tlae assistant grasps the bones of the leg below the knee with the limb 'ff .'^^Pf'^u°''- f" spi^e of this, reduction cannot be eflected further relaxation may be obtained by subcutaneously dividing the tendo Achillis, but this proceeding is hardly ever necessary. In making the extension the pull should be steady and continuous, not jerking: tt should be made in the direction of the axis of the bone, and the fractured bone should be grasped at either extremity, by the surgeon and his assistant, wthout including a neighbouring joint (2) The prevention of the return of the displacement—Reduction having been effected, means must be taken to prevent the fractured ends becoming again displaced. There are three causes which may con- duce to this : first, the contraction of neighbouring muscles ; secondly, the movements of the patient; and thirdly, the weight of the limb. Of these the contraction of the muscles is the most important and the most diffi- cult to overcome It is to be brought about by putting the limb in such a position that the muscles are m a state of relaxation, or by fixin^ the hmb in such a manner that the muscles though contracted cannot dis- place the fragments.

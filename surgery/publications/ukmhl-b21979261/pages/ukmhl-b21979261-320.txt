294 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES Bercrc wc consider the mode of applying a ligature to a cut artery and the way in which it occludes the vessel, it will be desirable to say a few words about the various materials of which ligatures are composed The principal ligatures used by surgeons at the present day are catgut silk tendon, and ox-aorta ; but many other materials have been advocated and used at different times, such as silver wire, silkworm gut, peritoneum, kc, '"'SuU«?^^^^^^ many surgeons for the ligature of arteries in an oSn wound! in fact, perhaps more largely than any other materia ; but at The same time it must be confessed that it is not a thorough y reliable material, as it is extremely difficult to render and keep it perfectly ""'^ Catgut is prepared from the intestine of the sheep, from which the mucous membrane and muscular coat are removed. It is then dried and ^Id as commercial catgut. The removal of the mucous and muscular coats is effected by a process of scraping, and this is usually very imperfectly done, so that in the ordinary catgut of commerce remams of these coa s can usually be detected by microscopic examination. It is an intective mTterfal, and has to undergo a careful preparation before it can be rendered Septic and safe for the surgeon to use. There are several ways of do ng S Perhaps the best and simplest way of preparing it is by soakmg the catgut, which should be wound loosely on a ree or some solid body to prevent it untwisting, in a solution of chromic acid of the streng h of i £ loo for twelve hours ; it is then taken out and shaken m a cloth to get rid of the greater part of the moisture, and placed in solution of one par of sulDhurous acid to loo of distilled water for another twe ve hours. It is hen tSen out and allowed to dry on the stretch This is known as 'green caLt.' It is kept in the dry state, and when required for u e is^ placed in a carbolic'acid solution (i in 20) for fifteen or twenty minuses be ore using. Another plan is to soak the catgut for forty-eight hols in a o ution of carboUc acid (i in 20) to which chromic acid (i in 4,000) has been added. The preparation of the catgut in this w^y how^ e^er requires care, as the amount of chromic acid used must have a definite relation'to the quantity of catgut to be sterilised, or if too m^ used it will be over prepared and non-absorbent; ^'m c^^^^^ under prepared and absorbed too soon. The object of the chromic acid is to preH tht too rapid absorption of the gut. When catg^^^^^^^^^^^^^ employed by Lord Lister as a ligature, it was prepared by f ^^^Pj) ft^n carbolic oil (i in 5) for a couple of months, but it was found to soften and absorb too soon, and this and the length of time required for its ;;?e'paiatL led to the introduction of the. chromicised gut. Cat^^t may^^^^ be prepared by soaking in corrosive subhmate (i in 100), orb) exposure to a drv heat of 284° F. for a few hours. . It is a well-recognised fact, however, that, either from some imperfedo or carelessness in its preparation, the catgut sold by instrument makers and others i not always aseptic, and indeed catgut which has been kep ?n watery or oily solutions of carbolic acid for many months has been st 11 nroved to contain micro-organisms, so that some surgeons have ceased to me^t as a fSrm of ligaturl, especially as they possess in sdk a material which?an be rendered absolutely aseptic and is therefore more certain y which can be renaereu y ^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^ reliable.

TREATMENT OF EMPYEMA 787 lung signs of suppuration may supervene. Under these circumstances the blood should be evacuated without delay, either by opening up the wound, if one exists, or making a free incision in the most dependent part, and subsequently employing antiseptic drainage. If the fluid IS a serous effusion, it may be withdrawn by means of an aspirator and this operation should be performed when medical treatment fails to cause absorption of the fluid, if the effusion is so considerable as to compress the opposite lung, or to produce orthopnoea; or in those cases where there are signs of failure of the heart's action. When the fluid is pus. It should in almost all cases be evacuated by a free incision through the chest wall. An exception to this rule may possibly be made in those cases of empyema following an attack, of pneumonia, as they will some- times recover after a simple aspiration, and the cavity will not refill. The existence of this form of empyema may be established by an examination of the pus withdrawn; which will be found to contain pneumococci, but no pyogenic cocci or tuberculous bacilli. There is often some difficulty in ascertaining from the general symptoms whether the fluid in the pleural cavity is merely serum (hydro- thorax) or pus (empyema), and therefore it is advisable to commence operations by investigating the case by means of the exploring syringe In this way a small quantity of fluid can be withdrawn and if necessary subjected to microscopic examination. If pus is found, in the majority The operation is performed as follows : The site having been selected the parts around are to be properly cleaned and rendered as aseptic as possible. Considerable difference of opinion exists as to the best position for the openmg. Some believe that the fifth intercostal space in urth"er b.'k"''"'i ^est.

On the whole, the incision in the mid-axillary line in the fifth nterspace IS the best.

' The treatment of this fracture is much the same as that of fracture of he anatomical neck ; but the elbow must be carried well forwards over the front of the chest, so as to force the upper end of the lower f agmen backwards and out^^^rds, and only the hand should be supported iSng so that the weight of the elbow may drag down the lower fragment and overcome the shortening. Passive motion requires to be commenced early, so as to prevent stiffness of the joint commencefl c Separation of the greater tuberosity.-This injury mav occur from direct violence applied to the shoulder, or in comieS th a dislocation forwards of the humerus (see fig. i8o) It s sa d also om^ times to occur from the violent contraction of the three muscles LerTeH mto It.

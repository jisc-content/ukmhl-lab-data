1126 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS This constitutes a bunion, which may ultimately suppurate, and the abscess open into the joint and lead to its destruction. Treatment.—In the early stages hallux valgus may be remedied by providing the patient with properly shaped boots, with the sole cut straight along its inner border. When changes have taken place in the shape of the bones, this is not sufficient, and an attempt should be made, by directing the patient to wear a sole plate, to remedy this condition. The sole plate (fig. 425) consists of a thin plate of steel accurately moulded to the under surface of the foot; in this slots are cut, and the toes can then be held in position by small straps passed through the slots and buckled over the toes. Failing this, a wedge-shaped piece of bone must be removed from the inner side of the distal end of the metatarsal bone. The toe can then be brought into proper position, and must be retained there until union has taken place. When the bunion is inflamed and threatens to suppurate, it must be treated by rest and warm fomentations ; and if the suppuration extends into the joint, amputation or excision may be called for. Hammer toe (fig. 426).—This is a by no means uncommon condition, and most frequently attacks the second toe. The first phalanx is Fig. 425.—Sole plate for hyper-extended on the head of the metatarsal the treatment of hallux l^one; the second phalanx is acutely flexed on the valgus. first; the position of the third phalanx is variable, sometimes flexed, sometimes extended. The first inter-phalangeal joint, therefore, projects above the level of the other toes, and, rubbing against the upper leather of the boot, causes acute pain. The skin over it becomes thickened and callous, and very often a bursa becomes Fig. 426.—Hammer toe. developed beneath the thickened skin. When the patient stands, the end of the toe rests on the ground, and here also the skin becomes thickened and hypertrophied.

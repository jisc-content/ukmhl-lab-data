INFLAMMATION 12 part, have on the leucocytes. Some of these chemical products have the power of attracting the leucocytes, others of repelling them. The former of these IS called ' positive chemiotaxis,' the latter ' i^tive chemiotrxis ' 1 he theory which these observers hold is that all inflammations are the lesult of the presence of micro-organisms in the tissues, that these bodies during their growth produce certain chemical substances which, by virtue ot their chemiotactic properties, draw out the corpuscles from the vessels 1'*;,'''"'^ ''V ^ "'-'^Snet attracts a piece of steel. It cannot be denied that this may be one of the causes of migration, but it is quite clear that It cannot be the sole cause, for emigration occurs where the inflamma- tion has been caused by mechanical means, in which there are, therefore no micro-organisms, and where, therefore, there can be none of their chemical products. While this emigration of the corpuscles has been going on, another • and equally important change has been taking place : the fluid part of the blood, the plasma, has also been exuding through the walls of the vessels and collecting in the pen-vascular spaces around the emigrated corpuscles so that the tissues of the inflamed area are not only infiltrated by cor- puscles, but also permeated by the fluid elements of the blood This exudation appears to be the result of a leaky condition of the walls of the vessels which from their damaged state are unable to act any longer as Alters, but allow the fluid constituents of the blood to pass through almost unchanged. It has been already noticed that in the condition of passive congestion the loaded vessels relieve themselves by filtering through their coats the serum of the blood, a fluid containing a small percentage of albumen and salt, and that they seem, therefore, to possess a discriminating power as to what shall pass through them-they act, in fact, as filters but when mflammation has been set up, and the functional activity of the vessel walls has been diminished by it, this discriminating power appears to be in a great measure destroyed, and the plasma of the blood passes through the walls of the vessels almost, if not quite, unchanged. This inflammatory exudation, therefore, which permeates the inflamed tissues, differs essentially from the passive exudation of congestion, and more especially in this important particular—that it is spontaneously coagulable while the other is not. ' This exuded material diff"ers considerably in diff"erent forms of inflam- mation, both as regards quantity and quality. In a typical case of trau- matic inflammation in a healthy subject, for example, it speedily coagulates and forms a clot, in which are entangled the migrated leucocytes and the red corpuscles which have passed out of the vessels. But in some cases the exudation is more watery, containing more serum and less fibrin factors, and under these circumstances it forms a less perfect clot, and is spoken of as a sero-fibrinous exudation ; whilst in other cases, no clotting takes place, or, at most, shreds of clotted material are seen floating in a fluid in which are contained the migrated leucocytes : this we term a serous exudation. Again, in other cases, there is a large admixture of red corpuscles, giving to the exudation an appearance of containing blood : this is known as a hcettiorrhagic exudation. And, finally, in inflammations of mucous surfaces there is an abundant shedding of epithelium, which, mixing with the exuda- tion, gives to it an appearance which is spoken of as c?-flupoifs exudation. In simple acute inflammation, the clot which is formed by the coagu- lation of the exudation is firm, and in the act of coagulation it entangles in its meshes the greater part of the leucocytes which have migrated

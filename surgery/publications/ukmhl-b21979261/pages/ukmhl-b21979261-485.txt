In Pott's fracture, for instance, the dislocation L not a true kteral displacement outwards, but the astragalus undergoes a partial rotation on an antero- posterior axis through its centre, so that its upper articular surface is inclined inwards and the sole of the foot everted (fig. 162, b, c, and d). The signs of these in- juries are unmistakable; the foot is markedly everted, and in Dupuytren's fracture is carried upwards as well; there is a hollow over the fracture of the fibula and the internal malleolus, or its broken surface projects strongly under the skin. In addition to this there is great swelling and bruising, and crepitus mil usually be felt on overcoming the displacement. Care must be observed not to mistake an ordinary Pott's fracture for those cases where the lower end of the shaft of the tibia is broken. In he latter the displacement is greater, the crepitus is more marked, and the nrominent end of the upper fragment is above the level of the ankle joint In displacement inwards the patient slips on the outer aspect of the foot and it is forcibly inverted or.turned inwards, carrying with it the Fig. 163.—Displacement in Tott's fracture, case the deltoid hgament is ruptured.

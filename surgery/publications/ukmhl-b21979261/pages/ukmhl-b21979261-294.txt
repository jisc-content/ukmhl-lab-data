268 (lENERAL DISEASES BILHARZIA H/EMATOBIA The bilharzia haematobia is a trematode worm, which gains entrance into the human body tlirough the alimentary canal, the embryos being ingested with drinking water. The disease occurs in tropical climates, but is especially severe and common in Egypt. From the alimentary canal the embryos find their way into the portal circulation, and reach maturity in cavities in the radicles of the portal vein, or the vein itself, or sometimes in the vesical veins, and these produce numerous ova, which tend to reach the mucous surfaces and there escape, especially through the mucous surfaces of the urinary organs. The most prominent symptom of their presence is hematuria, accompanied by pain and frequency of micturition. The blood may be passed with the urine or at the end of the act of micturition, and often contains clots in which the worm is found. The hsematuria may be, and often is, intermittent. • ' Treatment.—No specific remedy is known for disease, which has a tendency to wear itself out if the patient is removed from the source of infection. The liquid extract of male fern and methylene blue, in 5-grain doses, is said to be beneficial, at all events in relieving the strangury.

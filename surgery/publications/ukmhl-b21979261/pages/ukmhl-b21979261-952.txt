914 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORCiANS linear eschars have been made. Iodoform is then insufflated over the charred surfaces, and the patient kept in bed. His bowels may be made to act upon the fourth day, but the motions are to be passed in the recumbent position for three weeks or a month, until the parts are hrmly cicamsed. ^ irreducible prolapse amputation is indicated. The protrusion is divided close to the anus; all bleeding points secured as divided- the two peritoneal surfaces which are in apposition are then united by a continuous suture, and the lower cut end of the bowel united to the skin at the anal orifice. The objection to this operation is that the natient, at all events for some considerable time, has no control over his bowels and a fresh prolapse may occur. The patient should therefore be enioined to pass his motions into a bed pan. In some cases of inveterate nrolapse, the abdomen has been opened and the rectum drawn up to its fullest extent, and attached to the abdominal wall by sutures passed through the meso-rectum. . , , • , • u ^ <.u Pruritus ani is a most distressing and intolerable itching about the anus, generally occurring at night and preventing rest, and rendering the patient's life miserable. It may occur from several causes; in a con- siderable number of cases it is due to eczema or some other eruption ; in others it is due to pediculi or scabies, or to thread worms in the rectum ; in others habitual constipation appears to be the cause, and it has been suggested that it is due to the absorption of P°'s°"°}^^ P^.^^^^^^"^";;/,^^ gastro-intestinal tract circulating in the blood; and ^^^^ly"^'^ number of cases it is believed to be due to a true neurosis of the lectum, not dependent on any systemic or local inflammatory trouble. The treatment must have special reference to the cause, it it is aue to eczema, the local application of preparations of tar, and if there are any gouty symptoms, the treatment of these is indicated. If there is habitual constipation, the constant use of saline aperient waters is to be recom- mended. In those cases where the disease has a neurotic origin the treatment is very difficult. The local application of cocame g-;^^jehef or morphia and oleate of mercury. In some cases I have found great benefit from a lotion consisting of hydrocyanic acid, calamine, and alycerine in water. Internally phenacetin or antipyrin appears to do good m some cases ; in others a course of arsenic is beneficial. INNOCENT TUMOURS OF THE RECTUM Innocent or benign tumours of the rectum are usually known by t^"'polypus I ... because alrnost all of these — have a tendency to become more or less pedunculated. The principal are (i) the adenoma, (2) the fibroma, and (3) the papilloma. I The adenoma is perhaps the most common, ^nd is e p^^^^^^^^^^^ fnnnd in voung children, though it may occur at any age.

799 MAUNSELL'S SUTURE (c) Maunsell's method.—This method of end-to-end anastomosis is by many surgeons regarded as the best, and the one which gives the most satisfactory results. The two ends of the bowel are first brought together by two sutures passed through all the coats, one at the mesenteric attachment, and the other exactly opposite to it. The ends of these sutures are left long. An incision is now made in the upper segment of the gut, opposite the mesenteric attachment, commencing about an inch from its divided end, and carried upwards in the axis of the bowel for about an inch and a half. The ends of the suture are passed between the divided ends of the bowel, up the lumen of the tube and out of the vertical slit, and then by gentle traction the divided ends (fig. 309, b) are invaginated and drawn out of the artificial opening (fig. 309, a). A long straight needle armed Fig. 309.—Maunsell's suture. with horsehair is now passed through both sides of the protruding bowel about a quarter of an inch from its free margin, care being taken to include all of the coats of the intestine (fig. 309, a, b). The suture is then picked up as it crosses the lumen of the tube, divided, and the halves tied on either side. From sixteen to twenty sutures are now applied around the tube, and the two ends securely sutured together, with their peritoneal surfaces in contact. All the sutures are cut off short, and by gentle traction on the lower segment the invagination is reduced. Finally, the longitudinal wound which has been made in the gut is closed by Lembert's suture. If there is any doubt about the line of suturing, a row of Lembert's sutures can be applied around the circular junction, so as to sequestrate it; for it must be remembered that the sutures forming the circular junction penetrate all the coats of the gut, and there may be some risk of leakage.

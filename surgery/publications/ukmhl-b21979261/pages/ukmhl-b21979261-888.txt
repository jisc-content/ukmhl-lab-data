850 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS before the gut can be reduced ; the opening should then be closed. When the obstruction is owing to a stricture, resection of the portion of the gut may have to be performed, or a short-circuiting or artificial anus made (see page 840) If a volvulus is present, an attempt may be made to untwist it but this is generally not possible, and even if it is untwisted there is a great tendency for it to re-form ; under these circumstances it is necessary, if the volvulus is in the sigmoid flexure, to draw up the bowd above the twist into the external wound, and make an artificial anus ; if it is in the small intestine, the portion of gut involved must be excised. Where a foreign body is lodged in the bowel and is the cause of the obstruction, an endeavour should be made to alter the position of the body and push it into a more healthy part of the bowel, and then cut down upon it and remove it, subsequently closing the wound with a Czerny-Lembert ^^^^After the cause of obstruction has been removed, the question arises as to whether it is desirable to evacuate the contents of the bowel, so as to prevent the further absorption of septic material; and the opinion of those who have devoted special attention to this subject appears to be in favour of this proceeding. Mr. Treves advocates it as a routine measure, and says that in his own practice it has had the effect of reducmg the mortality after operation to one-half of its original rate. Certainly if there is much distension, and if the vomit has already become stercora- ceous, it ought always to be done. The most distended coil of intestine is brought up to the external wound, and being carefully guarded by sponges! an incision is made into it; a glass tube, or a Pauls tube (fig -^11, g), is inserted and tied in, or fixed to the bowel wall by a single encircUng thread. This tube is allowed to remain in for some days, and the artificial^ anus thus made can usually be easily closed after the recovery of the patient. It sometimes happens that the surgeon is called upon to operate on a case of acute intestinal obstruction in which the patient is not in a con- dition to stand such an extensive operative procedure as the above: the abdomen is much distended, the vomit has been for some time s ercora- ceous and there is marked vital depression, so that even the administration of an' anesthetic is fraught with danger Under these circumstances, a few drops of cocaine should be injected under the skin over the most distended and prominent coil of intestine and an incision i^de in he abdominal wall at this spot.

An incision is then made into the bulging gut, and a glass tube introduced and tied in. Through this the fjca conten ran escape and all search for the obstruction must be deferred till a later date when the patient has recovered from the effects of the septic abso p- fon.

562 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES of effusion is the position of the Umb, which is flexed, abducted, and rotated outwards, and more or less fixed in this position. Several reasons havTbeen assigned for this. It is probably due to the same cause which nroduces changi of position-generally semiflexion-in other jomts under similar conditions, namely, that it produces the greatest relaxation of the Cments and therefore the greatest ease. Acute septic synovitis of the ?c nnrnmmon in pyeemic cases, and also in acute epiphysitis of ^'e uppe " d S the f miS because the epiphysial cartilage is situated in the S In these cases free incision as early as possible is required, for diXement is liable to occur, or the head of the bone become rapidly s^paraterfro^ the shaft by the destructive process going on in the neSourhood of the epiphysial cartilage, if active measures are not at once resSted to In dealing with these cases an anterior incision should be • made asif for excision%f the hip, so that the joint can be thorough y explored with the finger, and then a counter opening should be made '"^S^^t^T^e hip, either from septic causes or in tuber- culo^u:Xtions, may lead to ankylosis, and ^^^^^ either in a good or faulty posi- tion. When the ankylosis is in a good position, nothing much requires to be done, unless it is slight and due to peri-articular effusion, when the functions of the joint may be restored by well-regulated movements and massage; but if the adhesions are old, firm, and especially if they are intra-articular, probably yery little benefit ^nll be obtained from these measures ; and if the patient is antesthetised and the adhesions forcibly broken down they will in all probabihty form again; as there is some risk of disaster in performing this opera- tion, it is better to leave the patient alone, especially as an ankylosed hip in a good position Fig. 200.—Synostosis of the hip joint in an accompanied by a very extremely faulty position.

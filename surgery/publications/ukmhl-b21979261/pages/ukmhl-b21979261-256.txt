230 GENERAI. DISEASES ally the sDurcc of dcrnioids; these are the thyro-glossal duct, the post-anal gut, and the branchial clefts. The thyro-glossal duct in the embryo passes from the foramen ctecum of the tongue to the isthmus of the thyroid body. It usually becomes obliterated and disappears. Should it not do so, it may form a dermoid under the tongue situated deeply between the two genio-hyo-glossal muscles. The/>ost-anal gut of the embryo may give rise to dermoid cysts, in consequence of its non-obliteration. These are situated in the loose Fig. 49.â€”A large cystic hygroma of the arm in an infant cured by a single tapping. The arm is shown before and after operation. (From a photograph.) connective tissue between the rectum and the anterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, or may sometimes be found in the rectum itself, attached to its mucous membrane. In the same way, a part of one of the branchial clefts may remain unobliterated and may form a dermoid cyst. The most common situation for these is beneath the deep fascia at the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. These tumours, like many other conditions arising from arrest in development, have a tendency to run in families. Some years ago I saw a patient with one of these cysts,

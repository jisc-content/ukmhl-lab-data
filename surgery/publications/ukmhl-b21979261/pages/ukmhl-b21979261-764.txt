728 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS small and intermittent, and death ensues either suddenly from spasm, or more slowly from suffocation without spasm, or still more gradually from obstruction preceded by unconsciousness. Treatment.—Great relief is often afforded by free scarification of the swollen tissues. This is done by means of a sharp-pomted bistoury, guarded to within half an inch of its point, the parts being illuminated by the laryngoscopic mirror. The patient is afterwards inclosed in a steam tent and should constantly inhale steam to which compound tincture of benzoin or tincture of henbane has been added. The throat may be mopped out with a solution of nitrate of silver (sj to gj), or with a lo per cent solution of cocaine. Hot fomentations should be apphed externally. Occasionally antimonial wine (m iij) and tincture of aconite (ni ij), given every half-hour until some effect is produced on the pulse, is of use. It, notwithstanding these remedies, the difficulty in breathmg increases, no time should be lost, but intubation, which is especially indicated in these cases, or laryngotomy should be performed. Chronic laryngitis may be simple, catarrhal, tuberculous or syphihtK^^ catarrhal (follicular) laryngitis may result from an acute attack or may arise from constant strain in forced vocahsation. It consists of an inflammation of the glandular follicles of the mucous membrane. It is characterised by an alteration in the voice and a sense of effort in sustaining it. With this there is a sensation of dryness and uneasiness about the larynx, and the patient is constantly hemming and hawking.

Tuberculous laryngitis consists m a deposit of tubercle beneath the mucous membrane, which caseates and breaks down, leading to the formation of ulcers, and when extensive results in destruction ot the epiglottis or necrosis of the cartilages. Most frequently it is only a part ot a general condition of tuberculosis, but in some cases the disease may commence in and be confined to the larynx. _ The chief symptoms are at first huskiness and then gradual loss of voice, accompamed by cou ii, expectoration, night sweats, emaciation and death. In many cases there is also difficulty and pain in swallowing. In the early stages, upon laryngo- scopic examination, a very characteristic pyriform swelling of the mucous membrane covering the arytenoid cartilages may be seen and later on numerous small ulcers are found on the aryteno-epiglottidean folds tne posterior surface of the epiglottis, and about the upper opening ot tne larynx.

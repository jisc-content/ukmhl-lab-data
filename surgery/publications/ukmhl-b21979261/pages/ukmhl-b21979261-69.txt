43 TRAUMATIC FEVER into hospital, the patient is in a condition of shock, and ^^f^X^^^^^^^^^^ subnormal; as soon, however, as the patient begins to la ly the empera ture begins to rise, and very shortly reaches the normal point, it does not stop there, but continues'to rise until it reaches, let us say, a poin two degrees above normal, never much more. When we visit our patient the next day, we find that he has a temperature perhaps of loi 1^., and this may be'all. In a slight case there may be no other febrile syn^f^'J^' ^^e patient may have no headache, no acceleration of the pulse, and is not con- scious of aiiy feeling of illness. If the wound remain aseptic th^ tempera- ture speedily begins to fall, and in the course of three or four days or eA, en less, reaches the normal point. This is the so-called aseptic t^-^^^'^f But supposing serum and blood have been allowed to remain in the wound and bacteria have been admitted to it, putrefaction sets m, and chemical products {ptomaines) are formed as the result of this fermentative Fig. 7.

The temperature again rises, it may be before it has reached the normal, when the primary fever is masked by this secondary fever, and the patient presents other symptoms of febrile excitement. The temperature rises rapidly, and attains a much higher degree than it did in the primary attack, often reaching 103° F. or 104° F. (fig 7) The skin is hot, the face flushed, the pulse accelerated, the tongue furred the secretions diminished, and there is often delirium. It will_ be seen that, in these cases, the fever does not commence until some tune after the injury, generally on the second or third day, until, indeed, the putrefactive process has been established ; it generally reaches its highest point about the third, fourth, or fifth day, and then remains at the same hei'^ht until about the ninth or tenth day, when a considerable defer- vescence usually takes place. This is to be attributed to the formation of granulations, which, as we have already mentioned, act as a barrier to the

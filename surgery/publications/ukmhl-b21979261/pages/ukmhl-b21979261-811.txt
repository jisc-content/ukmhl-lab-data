' When paraplegia supervenes in cases of spinal caries, it is not necessary in the majority of cases to alter the treatment, beyond reUeving the bladder regularly if retention is present, and guarding against bedsores; but if the pressure symptoms actually threaten life, as in cases of intractable cystitis or of bedsores ; or if the paraplegic symptoms persist for a long period, and are probably due therefore to the formation of scar tissue outside the dura mater ; or where there is reason to believe that pus has found its way into the canal and is pressing on the cord, then the operation of laminec- tomy should be performed. It should also be performed in those rare - cases where the disease is situated in the posterior part of the spinal column it should not be done when there is active tuberculous mischief in other organs, or when the symptoms of paraplegia have suddenly manifested themselves, or there is reason to believe that spinal meningitis is present liammectomy.—The patient is placed on his left side, well rolled over to the right, and an incision is made in the middle line of the back ' over the promment spines. The soft parts are reflected on either side and with them the periosteum, until the bones are thoroughly exposed 'The laminae are then divided, close to the articular processes on either side with a saw or strong cutting forceps, and the arch wrenched out with sequestrum torceps. 1 wo, three, or more arches are removed in this way, until the vertebral canal is freely exposed. In some cases the dura mater will be tound to be covered with a thick coating of tuberculous granulation,or fibro- cicatricial, tissue, and this is to be scraped away with a sharp spoon until the dura mater is exposed; care must be taken to prevent the blood running down the canal, and bleeding must be arrested by pressure. As soon as the posterior surface of the cord is cleared, it must be gently drawn first to one side arid then the other with a broad, flat director, and the front of the canal cleared by scraping m a similar manner. The aim of the surgeon is to see re- turning pulsation m thecord, and he should not be satisfied until thisis visible 1 he surface is now to be irrigated with sterilised water at a temperature of 105 i< or with some antiseptic solution, and the skin wound closed and dressed without dramage.

The former is the more common of the two in the proportion of three to two. The dislocation can only take place when the mouth is widely open. When this is so, the condyle of the jaw is situated on the eminentia articularis, and very shght force, or even muscular action, may cause it to become displaced forwards by tilting it over the summit of the ridge. It may thus become dislocated dur- ing the act of yawning, shouting, or vomiting, by the spasmodic action of the external pterygoid, or by a blow on the side of the jaw while the mouth is open, or in extracting a tooth, or passing a stomach-pump tube, or taking a cast of the mouth. . . v^:i„i.„rj,i mouth is widel Symptoms.-When the d-location^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ th -^^^^^ . ^ open and cannot be closed, and the . ^ ,,,hen viewed the upper, so that the chin is f ^5^^^^Xs Jannot^K and in profile, appears to be elongated.

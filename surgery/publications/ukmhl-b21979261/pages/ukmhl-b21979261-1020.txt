INJURIES AND DISEASES Ol' SPECIAL ORGANS fifty-five. Sir H. Thompson states that it is present in one-third of all males over the age of sixty, but only produces symptoms in one case out of every fifteen. It used to be considered that the enlargement was a merely physiological process, due to advancing years, but this is now not believed to be the case. Some men attain a considerable age without any enlargement at all. By many it is believed that the enlargement occurs most frequently in those whose sexual vigour has been considerable in early life, and by others that it is due to previous attacks of gonorrhoea, especially when these attacks have been complicated by prostatic conges- tion or inflammation. The enlargement is due to an increase in all the tissues of which the gland is composed—muscular, connective, and glandular— Fig. 378.—Enlargement of the lateral Fig. 379.—Enlargement of the middle lobes of the prostate. (From the lobe of the prostate. (From the Museum of St. George's Hospital.)

In most cases it is the connective tissue of the gland which is principally increased, and these are the cases where the organ attains its largest size. In some instances a local hypertrophy of the muscular or glandular element may take place, and an isolated tumour be formed which is first embedded in the g'f "d a»a may after a time protrude from the gland into the urethra or bladder, forming a pedunculated tumour. When the muscular element is princi- pally involved, a tumour is formed which exactly resembles a fibroid tumour of the uterus, and when embedded in the gland can be readii)

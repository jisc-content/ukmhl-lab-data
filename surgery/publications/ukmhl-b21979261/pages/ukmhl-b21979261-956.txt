9i8 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS recovers, and becomes strong, healthy, and plum]), and shows no furtlier indications of developing tertiary symptoms. Another view, which was first suggested by Gossehn, of Pans, seems to me to be a more probable one, namely, that it is a chancrous ulceration extending from the vagina, either by the discharge running down to the anus or through menstruation, or it may be by direct contact from the male organ. If we adopt this view we at once explain why the disease occurs in women, and especially among the poorer classes, for it is among these that it is usually met with. These women are more apt to get sores about the genitals, and are probably not so careful when they do so as to cleanhness and treatment. •,• r The disease, then, I believe, is a chancrous ulceration extending from the vagina, and its continuance and reluctancy to heal is due to the diseased surface being constantly irritated by the passage of faeces over it. It is right to mention that we do undoubtedly occasionally meet with a true syphilitic disease of the rectum, which consists in the infiltration of the wall of the gut with a new formation, to which Fournier, who first described it has given the name of ano-redal syphiloma ; but this is a very different condition from what is ordinarily described as syphilitic disease of the rectum In these cases of true syphilitic disease there is no ulceration, and on introducing the finger into the bowel the mucous membrane is felt intact and apparently natural, but the other coats are thickened and in- durated over a considerable area, and the calibre of the gut very materially "^'""sYSms.—Patients present themselves with the history that they have for some time experienced difficulty in defsecation, especially if the motions have been at all constipated, and that the act has been attended with great pain Added to this there has been an abundant discharge of sanious, offensive pus, and it may be that the motions have been noticed to be tapeX o'r scybalous. Upon examination with the fi^V'^JTbS of the rectum will be found to be rough and ho^ey-combed, and to b eed freely, the diseased portion often being surmounted by a contracted fibrou ring, where cicatrisation has taken place.

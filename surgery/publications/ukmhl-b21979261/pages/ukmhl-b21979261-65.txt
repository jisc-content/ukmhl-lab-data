SECTION II GENERAL INJURIES CHAPTER I CONSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS OF INJURIES Shock is that state of general depression of the vital activity which occurf after severe injuries, especially where there has been violent stimulation of the peripheral nerves and nerve endings, but may be nrred also by some powerful impression applied to the nerve centres. The commonest form of injury which produces shock is some force which damages a large number of branches of the sensory nerves ; hence we find Tat it is esplcially liable to follow injury to those parts which are argeW supplied with sensory nerves, as the head, the abdomen, the hand he test cle and the urethra: This is a point of considerable importance because it would appear to have an important bearing on the most probaSe theory of the pathology of this condition Numerous theories have been advanced at different times to explain the manner in which shock is induced, but the most feasible and the one most usually accepted s that it is a condition of exhaustion of the medulla and spinal cord following severe irritation of the peripheral terminations of the sensory and sympathetic nerves. It has been abundantly proved by experiment that over stimulation of the peripheral endings of _ sensory nerves leads to exhaustion and temporary suspension of function of the corresponding centres, just in the same way that over-stimulation of rnotor nerves leads to fatigue and suspension of function lu muscle. So it is behaved that some injury, that is to say over-stimulation, of the peripheral _ nerve endings produces a condition of exhaustion and partial suspension ot function in the centres of the medulla and spinal cord, which causes a great depression in the general vital activity. So it follows that_ injury to those parts which are largely supplied with sensory nerves, that is to say, injury to a large number of nerve endings, is followed by more exhaustion of the nerve centres, and therefore more shock, than injury to those parts which are not so largely endowed with sensation. We therefore find hat the most common form of injury which produces shock is some crushing force which damages a number of branches of sensory nerves, and that very often the amount of shock depends on the extent of the injury rather than on its depth and degree. .i:h-^â€žc The extent and amount of shock are influenced by certain conditions. Thus old people, who are the subjects of degenerative changes, and young

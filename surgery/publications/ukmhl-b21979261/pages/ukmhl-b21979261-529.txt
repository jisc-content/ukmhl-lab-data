503 DISLOCATION OF THE SHOULDER arises generally in cases of infantile paralysis, but may be due to nerve injury or neuritis. The treatment consists in applying a belt round the upper part of the chest, with shoulder straps to retain it in position, and the application of massage and electricity to the paralysed muscles. Dislocation of the shoulder.— Dislocation occurs much more frequently at the shoulder joint than at any other articulation. It has been computed that dislocation of the shoulder occurs as frequently as all the other dislocations in the body. This is due to the anatomical construction of the joint, and to the free range of movement that it enjoys, as well as its exposure to injury. Causes.—For the most part dislocations of the humerus are produced by force applied to the elbow or hand when the arm is abducted from the body, as in falls on the hand or elbow with the arm outstretched. When the limb is in this position, the head of the bone projects beyond the lowest point of the glenoid cavity and stretches the lower and inner part of the cap.sule, which is the weakest part; any force applied to the limb easily tears the ligament whilst in this state of tension, and the head is driven through the rent into the axilla, producing primarily a dislocation in which

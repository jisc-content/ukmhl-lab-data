TONSILLECTOMY 665 infiltrated with lime salts, forming concretions. AVhen much enlarged there is obstruction to the breathing; the child breathes with the mouth open, snores in its sleep, and speaks thickly. When the enlargement is moderate in amount, the principal inconvenience arises from repeated attacks of inflammation to which the child is liable, and which leave the tonsil larger after each attack. But when the tonsils have become con- siderably enlarged, they become the source of serious derangement to the general health. They spoil the voice, which becomes thick and husky ; they impede the hearing ; they prevent sleep except with the mouth open,' and the child is apt to suddenly waken with a feeling of suffocation ; and they obstruct respiration, so as to produce a partial vacuum in the chest, which leads to permanent deformity, imperfect aeration of the blood, and an mterference with the general nutrition of the child. Treatment.—In cases of slight enlargement of the tonsil it is advisable to try the effect of constitutional treatment before resorting to operation, especially if the child is very young; but if the enlargement is consider- able there is only one effectual mode of treatment, by removing a part of the gland. The constitutional treatment consists in the internal adminis- tration of iron and cod-liver oil and strict attention to hygienic surround- ings, with the local application of iodine or perchloride of iron and glycerine to the tonsil. Tonsillectomy may be performed either by means of the bistoury or by a special instrument called a guillotine. Personally, I prefer to remove a part of the tonsil with the bistoury, as by this means the lower part of the organ, which often hangs down into the pharynx, can with certainty be removed, but very often escapes removal when the guillotine is used. To excise the tonsils with the bistoury in children, it is, however necessary to administer an ansesthetic, whereas this is not always required m removing them with the guillotine if the fauces have been brushed over with a 10 per cent, solution of cocaine. In performing the operation with the bistoury the child is ansesthetised, and the mouth having been opened by means of a gag, the head is raised and allowed to rest against the shoulder ot the arieesthetist, so that a good view can be obtained. The left tonsil IS now seized with a volsellum, and the projecting mass cut off from above downwards, inclining the cutting edge of the knife slightly inwards as it cuts its way through,, so as to avoid all risk of wounding the internal carotid artery. The instruments are now changed in the hands, the knife being held in the left and the volsellum in the right, and the other tonsil similarly removed. It is advisable to guard the cutting edge of the posterior part of the blade of the bistoury by winding a piece of lint around it, so as to avoid injuring the tongue or lips.

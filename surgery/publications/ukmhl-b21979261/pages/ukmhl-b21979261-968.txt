INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS through it, more than could be contained in a bladder which obviously vas not distended before the catheter was passed ihe manner m which The fluid flows from the catheter should be noted as it is characteristic. It does not flow in a continuous steady stream, as when it is expelled from an intact bladder, but flows in leaps which correspond with the respiratory movements. In some cases when the catheter is in the peritoneal cavity, Se point of it may be felt through the abdominal _ wall if the handle s deoressed If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, a useful test may be aoDlied in the following way : a known quantity, say a pint, of hot boric^S d solution is injected into the bladder and then allowed to return, and the amount which is returned is measured. If there is a rupture, a considerable quantity will find its way through the rent into the peritoneal caX and a less quantity will be returned than was injected. If no treat- ment is adopted,- in a very short time symptoms of peritonitis will supervene, and the patient will probably die. • , u ^.a^ Treatment—As soon as possible after the diagnosis has been made, the abdomen should be opened in the middle line, and the fluid m the peritoneal cavity thoroughly removed with sponges. The rent in the Sder should t'hen be sought for and cl-^\demonstra.e^^^^^^^^^^ sutured by a series of Lembert's sutures, which should extend a little beyond either extremity of the rent and be apphed close enough to preven aiTescape of urine. When the suturing is completed, the abdomuml cavity should be flushed with hot normal sahne or bone acid solutioii and a Keith's glass drainage tube introduced into the recto-vesical pouch for a few hours! so as to remove any exudation. The rest of the wound is then sutured Lnd dressed in the usual way. A red rubber catheter is ntroduced into the bladder, and to it is attached tubing which passe into a receptacle under the bed, and by its siphon action keeps the bladder ^%xtra-peritoneal rupture is in most cases the result of fracture of the pelvis The anterior surface or the base of the bladder is the par °nvolved The urine which escapes from the bladder infiltrates the cellula tissue of the pelvis and sets up a diffuse pelvic eel ulitis, which often terminates fatally from pyemia or toxemia. Suppuration comes on, and abscesses point in the lower part of the abdomen and in ^he penneum The symptoms are to a certain extent the same as those ot mra peritoneal rupture. The patient is unable to pass drawn off" when a catheter is passed, merely an fluid; but as the catheter cannot be made to leave the ladder the urine^ never drawn off". In a short time, symptoms of extravasation of urine, inflammation, in the hypogastric region, supervene. nPtform- Treatment.-The treatment in these cases consists in at once pe^ orm ing a perineal cystotomy, so as to freely drain the bladder. F/^e shouW then be made into all the parts mto which urme has been ext^^^ vasated, both above the brim of the pelvis and in the P^.""^^^^'^"^^^^^^^^ tubes inserted. As in these traumatic cases the urine is P^^;^^^'^^^^^^^^^^^^ and free from bacteria, this treatment is followed by a l^^S^'^^f^'*^^^^^ success, especially in those cases, which however are rare, whe.e the injur) is not complicated with fracture of the pelvis. Wounds of the bladder are generally the result of stabs ^ gunsho? injuries when the bladder is full. They may, ho^Je^^;; be ^^^^^^^^^ by wounds through the rectum (see fig. 349): .They may bem^^^^^^^^^^ or extra-peritoneal. The symptoms, in addition to the wound and sUock

450 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES for three or four weeks, until a certain amount of union has taken place and then put the limb up in the immovable apparatus. Union is generally Fig. 156.â€”Nathan Smith's spHnt for the treatment of fractures of the femur. fairly firm by the end of the eighth week, but the patient should not be allowed to bear the weight of his body on the limb without any support for tw^elve weeks after the acci- dent. In children, union takes place much more quickly, and is generally quite firm in from six to eight weeks. In treating fractures of the femur in chil- dren, the plan advocated by Mr. Bryant should always be adopted. The ordinary forms of splints are constantly getting soiled by the urine and faeces, and require renewal. Mr. Biyant therefore recommends that these cases should be treated by vertical suspension. Extension stirrups having been applied, both limbs should be flexed at the hip, and the stirrups fixed to a bar over the child's bed, so that the sacrum barely touches the bed (fig. 157)- In children, fractures of the thigh usually unite without any shorten- ing, but in the adult shortening to a slight extent is a very frequent result of oblique fracture of the thigh by whatever means it is treated. When, however, this shortening does not exceed half an inch, it is a matter of com- paratively little importance, since it is corrected by a slight inclination of the pelvis, and the patient walks without limping.

840 - INJURIES AND DISEASES 01' SPECIAL 0R(;ANS tracks its way to the surface, very frequently at the umbilicus ; this is opened or allowed to burst, and a fistula is formed. The symptoms, in the early stage, are much the same as those which arise from cicatricial stricture ; first dyspeptic symptoms, and then attacks, 'at intervals of move or less complete obstruction, these attacks increasmg in severity,' until at last they culminate in complete obstruction, which cannot be overcome by medical means. _ ■ ■ a u The diagnosis between cicatricial and malignant stricture is made by attention to the following points; (i) the age of the patient, cicatricial stricture occurring usually in early middle life, malignant stricture rarely occurring before fifty ; (2) the history of the patient, cicatricial stricture beine usually preceded by a history of tuberculosis, dysentery, hernia, intussusception or injury ; (3) the more rapid progress of the disease in the malignant form, and the greater and more speedy emaciation ; and (4) the presence of a tumour, which can generally be detected in the malignant form ; at first movable, but after a time becoming fixed. Treatment.—The treatment in these cases must vary according to the condition of parts which is found upon opening the abdomen. I he ideal treatment is to resect the portion of the bowel which is the seat of the dSase, and join the two severed ends by one of the forms of enteror- d aphy mentioned above (page 797 eUe,.). Thi^ however, is not often possible - by the time that the symptoms are sufficiently clear to make a diagnosis, the growth has attained such a size and become so fixed to neighbouring parts, as to render it impracticable. If this is the case Sely palliative measures can be adopted, and these measures are of such a nature that they give great relief to the patient and materially prolong life the repeltld at'tacks of partial obstruction are P-vented, and^^^^^^^^ ulcerated surface no longer irritated by the passage of the faecal contents over it the progress of the growth is slow, and cases have been recorded Xre (he patients have lived four years and more after this has been done. Several methods may be adopted. „i oncQtnmnsis I. The bowel may be short-circuited by making a lateral ana tomosis between a coil of intestine above the growth, with one below. 1 he mtes- tinal contents then flow through the communication, without reaching the strictured part, and all fear of obstruction is removed. 2 The bo^el may be divided completely across above and bf o^ the diseased portion, and the two ends joined by end-to-end anastomos s- The uppe? end of the severed portion is then closed by a C^erny^Le^i bert suture, and the lower end attached to the external wound to " ^ ^^ ^'^^^ escape of mucus and discharge from the ulcerated surface.

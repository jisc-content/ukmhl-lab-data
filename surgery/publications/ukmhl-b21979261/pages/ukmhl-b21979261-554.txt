528 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES capsule which invests the head, and is therefore not osseous but fibrous. The head of the femur remains small and is frequently mdented where it rests against the innominate bone ; the neck is shortened and altered in direction. The capsular Hgament is much thickened and very capacious, embracing both the new articular cavity and the old, if there is any. The condition may exist on one or both sides, the proportion being about equal. It is far more common in females than in males, in the pro- ciuuuL uqua portion of seven to one In many instances a dis- tinct hereditary tendency can be traced. Symptoms.—The mal- formation is often not discovered until the child begins to walk, and then the position it assumes and its curious waddling gait draw attention to the subject. The position w^hen standing is one of extreme lordosis (fig. 189). This is due to a disturbance of the equilibrium of the body, the centre of gravity being behind its normal position. On placing the patient in the recumbent posture, the lordosis dis- appears. The trochanter is always above Nekton's line, but by traction it can generally be drawn down almost to it. The gait is of a peculiar waddling character. The patient first raises himself on his toes, and then incHnes towards that leg w4iich is bearing the greater part of the weight of the body, and slowly brings the other foot forwards. While he does this the body appears to sink on the side to which he is inclined, and if the hand is placed on the prominent trochanter it will be felt to rise, sometimes almost as high as the crest of the ^1*^"^- ^J^Jf^ one hip is only dislocated the lameness in walfangis much more TrUtment-Various methods have at different times been advocated for the treatment of this condition They may be ^1^^^^^^^ as^ f^^^^^^^ (i) prolonged extension; (2) reduction by manipulation, (3) opc operation.

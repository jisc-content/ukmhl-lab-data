6i2 INIURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORCiANS miv have erysipelas, which often occurs from septic wounds, and only differs from erysipelas elsewhere (see page 152) in the fact that, owmg to the density of the scalp, the pain is generally more severe than m other situaUcms^^^ cellulitis is another condition which, as we have seen, sometimes follows scalp wounds, which open up the sub-aponeurotic tissue ^^^^Abs^cesses of the scalp are very common, and may be situated in (1) the dense subcutaneous tissue, when they generally arise from eczema or impetigo or are associated with the presence of pediculi; in (2) the sub-aponeurotic tissue, when they arise from penetratmg wounds; or (2) beneath the pericranium, in connection with bone disease. Tumours of the scalp are common, and may originate in the con- nective tissue, or in the skin or its appendages. . Tumours arising from the connective tissue are hpomata angiomata fibromata, and sarcomata. Of these, the angiomata include n^evi and cirsoid aneurisms, already described (page 37 0- The only tumour of this class which requires special mention is one form of fibroma w'hich has received the name of pachydmnatocele, and is the growth described as molluscum fibrosum (page 233) occurring in the scalp. It forms large pendulous masses, most commonly growing from the occipital region, which increase gradually, painlessly, and are more than the male. The tumour is quite characteristic, and is not likely to be mistaken for anything else. The treatment consists in removal, but the surgeon must be prepared for very considerable haemorrhage O? tumours originating in the epithelial elements of the scalp the sebaceous cysts are the most common, and are frequently multiple, i he) wTeady been described (page 225).

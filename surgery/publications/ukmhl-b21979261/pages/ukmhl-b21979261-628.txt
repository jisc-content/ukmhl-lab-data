6o2 INTURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS substance \ ery speedily becomes involved by an extension of the inflam- matory process to it. The two conditions will therefore be considered tot^ether With the exception of the slight local mflammation which must necessarily follow all wounds and lacerations of the brain, Init which shows no tendency to spread, it is probable that all inflammatory conditions of the brain or its membranes, following injury, are due to the introduction of micro-organisms, whether there is an external wound or not In cases where there is an external wound, as in punctured wounds, compound fractures of the vault, or fractures of the base the septic orc^anisms -ain access to the brain and its membranes by a direct route ; bu't where these conditions do not exist, the micro-organisms may still gain access by an indirect route, and under these circumstances the adveni of the symptoms is often much delayed. The means by which they gain an entrance may be either through the veins, from thrombi spreading inwards through the diploic or emissary veins to the venous sinuses and so to the brain, or through the lymphatics to the outer surface of the dura mater It is said also that septic matter may find its way along a_ nerve to the membranes ; this is probably by extension along the permeural Ivmphatics which open into the sub-arachnoid space. Inflammation of the brain and its membranes usually makes its appearance on the second or third day after the injury when there is an open wound, so that the septic organisms are conveyed directly to the membranes : but in those cases where there is no wound, and the septic matter has to be conveyed by an indirect route, the advent of the symptoms may be delayed to the second or third week or even longer . r PatholoffV.-Upon examining the brain of a patient who has died oi acute septic meningo-encephalitis, the surface of the brain, especia y in the neighbourhood of the injury, will be found to be covered with a greenish yellow lymph, which may sometimes be ^l"\°^VP'''''J'.hvLsed ?acter. The pia mater will be intensely injected and often ecchymosed The convolutions of the brain will be flattened : the grey matter of the cortex of a darker colour than natural, and the white matter presenting an increased number of punct.^ vasculos^.

There are also frequently convulsions, especially v^ hen the convex surface of the brain is most involved. They may be I mitul to a single group of muscles, or one side of the body may be affected or here may ^e general convulsions.

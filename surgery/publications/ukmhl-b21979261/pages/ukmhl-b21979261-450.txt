When the fracture occurs from direct violence It usually takes place in the outer third, as this part is more exposed to injury. Fracture of the shaft.—In fracture of the shaft the bone usually gives way at its weakest part, at the junction of its curves,, a little external to the middle of the bone. It is here caused by indirect violence, and in the young is very often a greenstick fracture. When complete the fracture IS oblique, running from without backwards and inwards. It is always attended with considerable displace- ment of the outer fragment, which is drawn downwards by the weight of the arm and inwards by the action of the pectoral muscles, especially the pecto- rahs minor, so that on measurement the two ends of the bone will be found to be nearer each other than on the uninjured side.

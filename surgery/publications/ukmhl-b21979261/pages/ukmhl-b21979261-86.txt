6° GENERAL INJURIES organisms. AVith regard to the saprophytic bacteria there are two ways in vvh.cli we may prevent chemical unrest. We have already seen that putrefaction can only take place when some ferment (saprophydc fund) i brought into contact with dead animal matter. The exclusion of eithir of these two factors would therefore prevent the formation of any of those chemical products (ptomaines) which are so prejudicial. If we could entirely free our wounds from all dead animal matter, any number of putrefactive bacteria might be admitted without any putrefaction taking place ; and again, on the other hand, if we could shield our wounds from thi admission of any of these bacteria, any amount of putrescible animal matter may be allowed to remain in the wound without doing any harm As a matter of practice, however, it is advisable to combine these twofold ZZL P;7e"t"^g.P^t>^efaction: first, by scrupulous cleanliness, by drainage, and by position, to insure the perfect removal of all putrescible animal matter; and secondly, by careful attention to dressing, aiid bv the use of antiseptic means to exclude all organisms or destroy those which may chance to be admitted. With regard to the /j'^-"././. Lcrococd we must aim at preventing their entrance into the wound, by remembering the hl''h they come, and taking special care to' rid these pafts of them before the operation is commenced. This practically resolves itself into careful sterilisation of the patient's skin around the intended site of the operation, and of the surgeon's hands, instruments, and sponges For I think we may practically ignore any introduction of micrococci which may exist in the dust of the air of the room. The old-fashioned plan of keep^ dTril of carbolic acid solution playing over the site of the wound abandoned ^^e operation is now almost universally K« '^he patient's ^^/« must be most carefully sterilised, and this duty should be undertaken, if possible, at least twelve hours before the commencement of the operation. Every surgeon no doubt has his own plan of doing this and as long as it is efficiently done it probably does not matter what details are earned out. The plan which I usually adopt is, first of all to shave ttie part, it this is necessary, and then to well wash it with soft soap and carbolic acid lotion (i in 20). This must be done very thoroughli^ the site of the operation and a considerable area around being well scrubbed with a nail brush so as to remove the surface epithelium in which these oacteria live. After this has been done, the part is well bathed with ether or turpentine to get rid of all fatty material, and then thoroughly sluiced n? .n';TT!-'"'' "'^'''^ ^'°°°)- Cyanide gauze, wrung out of carbolic lotion (i m 40), is now applied, and is covered with a piece of ^^aterproof material (jaconet) and kept on until the patient has been placed on the operating table and anaesthetised.

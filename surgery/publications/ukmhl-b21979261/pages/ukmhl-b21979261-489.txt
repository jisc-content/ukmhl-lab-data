463 ACUTE DIFFUSE PERIOSTITIS Acute diffuse periostitis is an infective inflammation, which is now usually known under the name of panostUis or acute necrosis; the former because all the tissues of the bone, periosteum, endosteum, and bone proper, speedily become involved in the disease; and the latter because, whether originating in the periosteum, or in the medullary tissue, as it sometimes does, it always terminates in rapid necrosis of the whole of the part inflamed. When the disease begins, as it undoubtedly does in Fig. 164.—Osleu-plastic new bone formed from periostitis. (From ' A the periosteum. (From System of Surgery,' by the Museum of St. Hohnes and Hullce.) George's Hospital.) many cases, in the periosteum, it is chai-acterised by a rapidly spread- mg infiltration of this membrane with inflammatory exudation, which speedily ends in suppuration, and is accoinpanied by acute septicEemia. The disease is not, however, confined to the periosteum, but speedily ex- tends along the connective tissue in the Haversian systems to the medullary tissue. Here the same spreading septic inflammation is setup, and runs on to suppuration. Thd portion of bone involved is thus deprived of all nutritive supply, and death takes place. Pathology.—The disease is one of acute infective suppuration, due to the introduction of some of the pyogenic organisms, of which the Staphylo-

592 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS much • torn a momentary loss of consciousness, amountmg to scarcely more than giddiness, with perhaps temporary loss of sight or flashes of light before the eyes and confusion of thought for a few moments, to absolute unconsciousness, during which the patient may die. . ^ Symptoms —The symptoms of concussion are those of surgical shock (m<reAo) with additional brain symptoms. The patient lies insensible, this nse°nsibility being sometimes complete; at others it may not be quite complete, .so that the patient can be roused by shouting, and will evince pain upon being pricked or pinched. In all cases the insensibihty is iuddenf and comes on immediately after the receipt of the accident. The pulse is weak, often irregular and sometimes cannot be felt. The skin is cold and clammy, and the temperature subnormal. The muscles are relaxed and the limbs flaccid, but there is no paralysis. The pupils are equal generally somewhat dilated ; they respond to light, though it may be sluo-aishly The respirations are feeble and shallow, and irregular in rhythm. Thrsphincters of the bladder and rectum are relaxed, and there may be involuntary evacuation of urine and faeces. This is the hrst stage, that of collapse, and during it the patient may die, apparently from failure of the heart's action. .t., • • n • Sooner or later the stage of reaction comes on. This is^ generally in from ten minutes to half an hour, but it may be delayed for hours or even davs The f^rst sign of returning consciousness is, in many cases, vomit- ing ■ The pulse becomes stronger; the patient takes deeper inspirations, and the surface of the body becomes warmer. He can now usually be roused, though with difficulty. As consciousness becomes more and more con^plete, he complains of headache, which may continue for days, and usS lies in a drowsy state, taking no notice of what is going on around. The temperature speedily rises and gets above normal, but scarce y ever above ioo° F., and in the course of two or three days in an uncomplu^ated case fans aga n to normal. For some days the patient is stupid and drowsy hi Countenance has a dull, heavy look and he complains of gSdiness if he raises his head from the pillow.

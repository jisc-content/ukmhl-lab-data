As the artery which communicates with the aneurism becomes blocked, a second chain of anastomosis takes place between the branches coming off from the artery between the ligature and the aneu- rism and those coming off below the aneurism. Thus the limb below is nourished through a double set of anastomosing vessels. ihe accompanying diagrammatic sketch is intended to show the various changes which take place in the circulation and vessels after the Hun- terian operation (fig. loi). a- u ^ Where no branches are given off between the point of ligature and the aneurism, the sac of the aneurism and the vessel between the aneurism and the ligature become filled with blood by a regurgitation from the vessels below the aneurisih, communicating with vessels coming off above the ligature ; this coagulates, and cure takes place in t^e same way as before, the whole vessel between the sac and the hga- ture becoming obliterated.

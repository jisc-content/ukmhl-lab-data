ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATE 337 difficulty has been experienced in introducing the wire in a perfectly aseptic condition, and the late Mr. Hulke invented a small apparatus by which the wire can be paid off from a drum, inclosed in a vessel containing a solution of carbolic acid, directly into the sac. This plan of treatment should only be adopted in those cases where the more approved methods are im- practicable. Quite recently a case of successful treatment of an aneurism of the abdominal aorta by this method has been recorded by Mr. Langton. SPECIAL ANEURISMS Aneurism of the thoracic aorta.—Aneurism of the arch of the aorta talis rather under the care of the physician than the surgeon, and can very rarely be made the subject of surgical treatment. Aneurisms are more frequently met with in this vessel than in any other, and especially in the ascendmg portion of the arch. The signs by which they may be recog- nised vary much, and they may often exist for a very considerable time without givmg rise to any symptoms by which they can be recognised. 1 hey usually make themselves known by their pressure effects, as the tumour IS so deeply placed that there may be no external swelling, and a bruit is v^ry often absent. The pressure effects vary with the position and size of the tumour. There may be intense pain between the blade bones from pressure on the spine ; cyanosis, and distension of the veins, and oedema from pressure on the great systemic veins; dyspnoea from pressure on the trachea or bronchi; dysphagia from pressure on the oesophagus : paralysis of the abductor of the vocal cord from pressure on the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, or if the pressure is greater of both abductor .and adductor, with loss of voice. In addition to this there may be an increased area of dull- ness on percussion ; displacement of the apex beat of the heart on the wall of the chest, and inequality of the pulses at the two wrists, which may be veri- fied by a sphygmographic tracing. Later on a swelling may appear. If the arch is the part affected this may show itself just to the right of the middle hne, either displacing or absorbing and perforating the thoracic wall or it may appear in the neck in the supra-sternal notch.

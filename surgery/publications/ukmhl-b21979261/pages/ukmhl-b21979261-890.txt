852 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS the tumour, and then, by a series of compressions, gradually pushing the tumour backwards along the course of the colon. In the event of none of these plans succeeding in reducmg the intus- susception, laparotomy should be at once resorted to. The main point in the performance of the operation is to avoid any injury to the bowel, and this is to be done by the most gentle handling, and by, as far as possible, not allowing any intestine to escape through the external wound. In the first instance, a small incision should be made, sufficiently large to admit the finger and thumb; when the peritoneum has been incised, the finger is introduced and the tumour felt for, and when found, it is carried along the colon until the lower limit of the tumour is reached. The gut is now grasped just below this by the finger and thumb, and they are gradually worked upwards along the colon, pushing the tumour before them, until the intussusception is reduced. If this cannot be done, the incision must be enlarged and the tumour brought up to the surface of the wound; the intestine is then seized between the finger and thumb below the invagination, and the intussusceptum pushed out of its sheath. No attempt should ever be made to reduce it by traction. Occasionally it happens that in cases of intussusception of long standing it is impossible to reduce it; three courses are then open to the surgeon : (i) He may resect the invaginated portion of gut, and do an end-to-end anastomosis of the two severed portions of bowel. (2) He may make a longitudinal incision into the intussuscipiens, and drawing out the mtus- suscepted part, cut it off and suture the intussusceptum and the intus- suscipiens. This is done by Maunsell's method (see page 799). (3) He may make an artificial anus above the intussusception. This plan would probably never be adopted in the present day. It was formerly advocated because it was the most rapid way of completing the operation. Now that one of the other methods can be performed almost, if not quite as rapidl}-^ there is no object in doing what is a very imperfect operation, and one which leaves the patient in a sadly mutilated and distressing condition. Chronic intestinal obstruction.-Chromc intestinal obstruc- tion is always characterised by the slow and insidious way m which it sets in, being preceded by gradually increasing attacks of constipation, often alternathig with a spurious diarrhoea or discharge of watery, f^cal-stamed fluid from the bowel, set up by a condition of catarrhal enteritis induced by the irritation of retained fseces. ^v,.fr,ir Causes.-Like the acute form of the disease, chronic intestinal obstruc- tion may arise from several different causes, but in the majority ot cases the cause of this condition is situated in the large intestine.

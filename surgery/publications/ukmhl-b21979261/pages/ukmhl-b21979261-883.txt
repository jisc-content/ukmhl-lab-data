845 INTUSSUSCEPTION intussusception the symptoms of obstruction are not marked, or they may be absent, and there may be no stoppage to the passage of the intestinal contents down the tube. By intussusception is meant an invagination or prolapse of one portion of the bowel into another. The invagination is most frequently caused by violent, irregular peristalsis, excited generally by some irregularity in the diet, or it may be by the presence of worms, or in some cases by a growth, such as a polypoid tumour (fig. 336); but it may also be caused by a mechanical shake to the bowels, as in jumping, or by a blow on the abdomen. The disease is most common in children, Fig. 336.—Intussusception caused by Fig. 337.—Diagram of an intussuscep- a polypus.

In consequence of the invagination of one portion of the bowel into another, the intussusception consists of three layers of intestine (fig. 337): on the outside is the receiving tube or sheath, which is sometimes known as the intusstiscipiens; within this is the reflected tube, turned inside out, so that its mucous surface is in contact with the mucous surface of the ensheathing tube ; and internal to this is the entering tube, whose serous surface is in contact with the serous surface of the reflected tube ; and between them is the mesentery attached to these two portions of bowel. The reflected tube and the entering

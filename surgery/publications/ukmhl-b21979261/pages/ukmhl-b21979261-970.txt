INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS 932- which the urine will escape. The patient must be kept in bed until the extravasated blood has been absorbed, and then another attempt must be made to pass an instrument. When once a catheter is passed it must be tied in and kept there for several days, until the continuity of the canal is re-established. In all cases the after treatment by frequent cathetensm must be rigidly persevered with. ^ . , , Foreikn bodies in the urethra.-Foreign bodies may be introduced into the male or female urethra. They may either remain in the urethra, or may travel backwards into the bladder which is particu arly able to occur in the female, or in rare mstances they may be expelled. If they remain in the urethra, they must be of such a nature as not to com- pletely occlude the canal, and they may be retamed either in the penile or deepel- portion of the canal. They become coated with the salts of the urhne cLuse ulceration of the mucous membrane and dilatation of the ure hra behind. When they pass backwards mto the bladder, they become coated with phosphates and form the nucleus of a calculus. In the treat- ment of these cases, a good deal will depend upon the situation of the Sn body ; if it is near the meatus, it can often be extracted by fine urethml forceps or a bent probe. If situated farther back, the best plan is ^push it backwards into the bladder, and then crush it and remove he lagments, as in cases of calculus in the bladder (see Litholapaxy). If this is hinossible the foreign body must be cut down upon as it lies in the Srand extmctedrbut this is very likely to be followed by a fistula, whth is very difficult o heal. If the foreign body has passed back into Te bladder it must be crushed ; or if it has become incrusted with the salts of the urine so as to rendei- it too hard or large to crush, it must be exce ed 'by lithotomy. One of the most troublesome foreign bodies to deS with I a hair-pin in the female bladder. It is occasionally Introduced down the urethra by neurotic women, and slipping mto the bladder the points become entangled in the mucous_ membrane and reader it very difficul^. to extract. The best plai. is to dilate the urethra so that the finger can be introduced, and then the pin can be Sized and w^Adrawn by means of a blunt hook which is passed over the bend in the pin. SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY Malformations of the kidney are of little clinical i^mportance^ Am^ig the^?ost°'^ommon is the so-called Aorses/.e k.^^ey^ ^^^Ich TmSs of a fusion of the two kidneys at one end by renal o "merely fibrous tissue • in other cases the two kidneys may be fused along he whole le^^gth of their internal borders, forming a disc-shaped mass in he Sddle line. Another malformation is.where tl--is congemta atio^^ of one kidney, the other being proportionally e^l^'^S^^V J^^^^V from anJ of serious import when the working kidney becomes disabled from any rnnfp as in a?ase ^vliich occurred under my care, where the ureter became persistence of the foetal lobulation; the presence of two pelves or t.o ureters to the one kidney.

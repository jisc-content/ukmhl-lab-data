ABDOMINAL ANEURISMS 351 intermuscular septum between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor subhmis digitorum should be sought for, and when found the deep fascia should be mcised along this line. The connective tissue between these two muscles should be separated with the finger or a director, and the flexor carpi ulnaris drawn inwards with a retractor. The ulnar nerve which at this point lies superficially and a little to the inner side of the artery, will first be seen, and immediately below and external to this the artery will be found. The ven^e comites must be carefully separated from It, and the aneurism needle passed from within outwards. Ligature of the ulnar artery in the lower third of the forearm is more fre- quently required. The vessel here lies between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the innermost tendon of the flexor sublimis digitorum, with the ulnar nerve to Its inner side. An incision a couple of inches in length is made along the outer border of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the superficial structures and the deep fascia, which is here thin, are divided. The wrist is now to be slightly flexed, so as to permit of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris being drawn inwards, the veins separated from the artery and the needle passed between the nerve and the artery from within outwards liigature of the radial artery.-The radial artery may also be tied in the upper part of its course or at the wrist. In the upper part of its course the arter)^ is slightly overlapped by the supinator longus, which will have to be retracted outwards in order to expose the vessel. An incision two or three inches in length is made in a fine drawn from the centre of the bend of the elbow to the inner side of the styloid process of the radius. The deep fascia is exposed and incised along the anterior border of the belly of the supinator longus The muscle IS then drawn outwards, and the artery at once comes into view^_ The radial nerve lies some distance from the artery, and is no seen in this operation. ^' . Just above the wrist the radial artery may be ligatured by making an incision midway between the tendons of the supinator longus a d the flexor carpi radiahs, with the forearm in a position of supination Care must be taken to avoid the radial vein or a lige tributary of if which hes superficial to the artery. The deep fascia, which is th n must be then divided on a director, and the artery will be exposed wkh the companion vem on either side. These must be separated Ind he aneurism needle may be passed in either direction.

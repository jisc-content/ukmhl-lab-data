,62 GENERAL DISEASES form of hot boracic dressing, with the immersion of the arm for an hour or two once or twice a day in a hot boracic bath, will be found the most beneficial The patient will require a liberal nutritious diet, and probably the administration of some stimulant will be indicated. IV Paronychia ossea is that form of whitlow where the periosteum of the last phalanx becomes involved in the infective inflam- mation, and as a result is destroyed and the phalanx necroses As an mitial affection it is probably very rare, and those cases of paronychia ossea which we meet with are generally the result of an extension of the disease affectin<^ the pulp of the finger to the periosteum. In these cases the symptoms resemble very much those of the ordinary form of onychia, except that perhaps the pain is more severe and is especially bad at night, and he amount of constitutional disturbance is great. If the mcision for the relief of this condition has been delayed until the periosteum has been entirely separated from the bone, the latter inevitably perishes and the wound made does not heal until the bone separates at the joint and either comes away or is removed. The wound now closes, leaving a distorted and deformed shrivelled extremity to the finger. . , , , The treatment of this condition is exacdy the same as in the others, and consists in making an early and free incision.

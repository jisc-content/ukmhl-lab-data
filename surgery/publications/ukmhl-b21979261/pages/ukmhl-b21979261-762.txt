26 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS introduced into the stomach at the time of the operation, for the diverti- culum being gripped by the rectus muscle, and being bent over the costal margin in the form of an angle, constitutes a curved tube through which escape of fluid is scarcely likely to occur. The great advantage of this method is that it requires no permanent tube and does not give any trouble from leakage. Both Kader's and Marwedel's plans require a permanent tube. In Marwedel's method the tube is made to run between the muscular and mucous layers of the stomach wall (fig. 279); and in Kader's operation the tube is inserted through a small opening directly into the stomach. It is fixed there by Fia 279. -Marwedel's method Fu;. 28o.-Kader's method of performmg of performing gastrostomy. gastrostomy. two rows of Lembert's sutures, the second being placed over the first, and the summit of the fold is united to the parietal peritoneum ^^J,"^ rest of the wound in the abdommal wall is then closed.

798 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS this ^vay sutures are applied to about a third of the circumference of the gut, and then the mucous coat is brought together by a second row of sutures over the first knots. The rest of the circumference is united by the Czerny-Lembert method. In all instances in which an end- to-end anastomosis by the Czerny- Lembert method is performed, this modification of Wolfer should be adopted, as in the neighbourhood of the mesenteric attachment a leakage is very apt to occur if the Czerny-Lembert method is em- ployed throughout. {l>) Jobert's method.—This consists in invaginating one portion of the bowel into the other. The cut extremity of the lower end of the bowel is turned down into the tube for about half an inch. A long suture is then passed from the out- side of the bowel through its coats Fig. 307.—Wolfer's suture. and through the inverted portion, close to its free extremity ; secondly, it is passed from the mucous surface through the coats of the upper end of the bowel about half an inch from its free border, and finally again through the inverted layer of bowel, but this time from the inside of the gut and some- what nearer the bend. A similar suture is applied on the opposite side (fig. 308). By tightening the free ends of these two sutures the upper Fig. 308.—Jobert's suture. end of the divided intestine is drawn downwards and becomes inyaginated into the lower, and is fixed there by tying the two ends on either side together. A series of superficial sutures are now applied all round tne circumference of the bowel through the serous coat, at the angle where tne two portions of gut come together (fig. 308, b).

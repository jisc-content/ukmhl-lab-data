725 GASTROSTOMY The great disadvantage of this operation is that the tube can never be dispensed with. The Ssabanijews-Franck operation. — The abdominal wall may be divided by an oblique incision, starting an inch and a half from the median line of the body, and carried parallel with the lower margin of the left costal arch and about a finger's breadth below it, for a distance of two and a half inches ; or, what is perhaps better, by a vertical incision beginning opposite the eighth intercostal space, two inches from the median line, and carried downwards for three inches. In this incision, when the rectus muscle is exposed, its fibres are separated with a steel director and not cut. When the peritoneal cavity has been opened, the anterior wall of the stomach is pulled out of the wound, and a silk suture passed through its muscular and serous coats at the point selected for Fig. 278.—The Ssabanijews-P'ranck method of perfomiing gastrostomy. opening the viscus. This is held by an assistant, so that the stomach forms a long conical diverticulum protruding from the external wound, and the parietal peritoneum and the posterior layer of the sheath of the rectus are sutured around it (fig. 278, a). A second incision is made through the skin, over the margin of the costal cartilage, above and a little to the outer side of the first incision. With a pair of dressing forceps a track is formed under the skin in the subcutaneous tissue from the one opening to the other, and the diverticulum of the stomach is drawn along this track by means of the suture inserted into it, so that its apex appears at the second opening. A small perforation is now made into the stomach through this protruding apex, and its margins carefully and accurately sutured to the margin of the external wound (fig. 278, b). The remainder of this mcision and the whole of the first incision are then closed in the ordinary way, and the wound dressed. If considered desirable, food may be

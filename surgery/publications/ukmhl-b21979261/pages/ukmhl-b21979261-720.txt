684 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS CHAPTER IX INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE EAR For convenience of description it is customary to divide diseases of the ear into those of the auricle and external meatus ; those of the tym- panum, including the Eustachian tube and mastoid cells; and those ot ^^""iSries of the external ear.—The external ear is liable to be contused, especially during the game of football, and this is often attended by an effusion of blood between the cuticle and perichondrium on the anterior surface of the auricle. It constitutes what is termed a hmnatoma auris, and may occur spontaneously and independent of injury, trom its frequent occurrence in the insane, it used to be regarded as peculiar to them The auricle becomes enlarged, swollen, and of a bluish-red colour ; hard 'to the touch, and rarely fluctuating. As a rule it is desirable not to meddle with these cases; but if they are painful or become mflamed, an antiseptic incision should be made, the contents turned out, and the wound dressed antiseptically. _ ■,•>•••■ ,.1, Wounds.—The external ear is sometimes wounded in injuries o tn scalp A flap of the scalp may be torn down carrying the external eai Sit, or a portion of the auricle may be torn from the rest, and remain hanging by a small tag of tissue. Under these circumstances it should nevfr be removed, but after careful cleansing should be accurately adjuste by several points of suture. . f ^^„„„fi Foreign bodies in the meatus.-Foreign bodies areTrequentl introduced by children into the external auditory meatus, and may giv rise to very considerable trouble. The foreign body is generally tightly wedged in the meatus, close to the membrana tympani, and any attempt to remove it with instruments is attended with a nsk of injuring the mem brane or cuticular hning of the meatus, which may be followed ^^^^'^^^^^ results. It is only, therefore, in cases where the foreign body is lying ^os o "he external opening, does not completely fill the canal, and is of a of nature, like a roll of paper, that any attempt should be i?^^de to ^^^^m it by forceps, sharp hook, &c, In the majority of cases, injections of warm water should be used, and in many instances this wiU ^^^^eed m br g ng away the body at once; but should it not, it will probabb' do so in the course of a few days, after repeated injections. The child should De an^sthetised, and the auricle pulled upwards and backwards, mtly^ e head placed' so that the ear is in a dependent po-tion -.d a fo abk iet of water thrown along the roof of the canal. The water pene iehind the foreign body,\nd in -stances dislo^^^^^^^^^ rare cases where this does not succeed, careful efforts may be maa extract it; but this should never be done unless the child is under anaesthetic and the parts can be thoroughly illummated.

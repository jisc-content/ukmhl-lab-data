PREFACE This book is the substance of the Lectures on Surgery which I deHvered at St. George's Hospital for fifteen yearsâ€”modified, of course, from time to time in accordance with the advances made in the Science and Art of Surgery. I trust that these Lectures were of some use to my pupils, and I feel justified in thinking that they were, for I have been con- stantly asked to publish them. I have determined to do so, now that I can no longer teach by word of mouth, in the hope that, though debarred by lapse of time from taking any active part in teaching Medical Students, I may still be of some service to them, and that this work may assist them in their study of the Principles and Practice of Surgery. The book has been written mainly for Students, but I hope that Practitioners will find it a useful work of reference, containing a concise and practical account of the causes of surgical injuries and diseases, the signs by which they may be recognised, and the appropriate treatment to be adopted for their cure. The work may be regarded as the outcome of the experience of a Hospital Surgeon and Teacher for nearly thirty years. In writing it, I have been compelled, on account of the exigencies of space, to be to a certain extent dogmatic, and to state my own views of the nature of the various injuries and diseases that I discuss, with little or no allusion to contrary opinions which are held by others. This is especially so with regard to treatment. For the most part 1 have only described the treatment which, in my experience, has proved most beneficial, and have merely inci- dentally alluded to other plans, or have omitted them altogether ;

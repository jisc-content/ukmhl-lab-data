722 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS swallow any solid food without its appearing to stick atone particular point in the lullet Now he notices that the food sticks longer, and instead of his eventually getting rid of it, it regurgitates and is brought up again exactly hrt^condition^in which it was swallowed. If this regurgitated food is Examined it will be found to have an alkaline reaction, proving that it has not been n^ed with the gastric juice. Sometimes, however, the difficulty in swillow ng comes on quite suddenly. At first it is oft^en unaccompanied by n7n Mer on a good deal of pain is referred to the site of he disease. The mttnt now begins to retch up a quantity of frothy fluid, and when ulceration has taken place the food comes back stained with blood and mLed V h pus. The patient rapidly emaciates, especially in the malignant fo nfo the disease, and death occurs much more commonly from exhaus- tion than from perforation. When the disease is situated in the upper nart of the gullet, a tumour may be felt in the neck behind the larynx and usually mo?e pronounced on the left side, and the lymphatic glands in Ae neighbourhood may be found to be secondarily enlarged By auscul- tation S the oesophagus it is sometimes possible to detect the stoppage of he food current at the seat of stricture. The patient is made to swallow some gruel or thick fluid, while the surgeon listens with a stethoscope placed on the back in the middle line. Attempts have been made b)^ means of an cEsophagoscope to see the stricture, but hitherto without much success. The diagnosL of a malignant from a simple fibrous stricture of the oesophagus may be made by the history of some injury in the fibrous S m 5 tb^age of the patient-a stricture occurring before he age of for^y Sing p obably not cancerous ; by the rapidity with which the difficult) m c ;;c.ilnwinc/ increases â€¢ bv the general appearance of the patient, and he rS^ wirS on; and by.an external examination of^the pa s, when the diagnosis of a cancerous stricture may sometimes be a s sterbTa swelling being felt in the neck or by an enlargement of the glands. The diagnosis of stricture of the oesophagus may be confirmed by the anv suspicion that ulceration has taken place.

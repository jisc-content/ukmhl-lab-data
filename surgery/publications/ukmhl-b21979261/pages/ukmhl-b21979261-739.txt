TRACHEOTOMY Museum of St. George's Hospital.) 703 of cases appear to vary. The symptoms produced depend upon whether the bronchus is entirely occluded or not. If it is, no air can enter the lung, and the normal vesicular murmur is entirely absent, and all vocal fremitus IS lost, while the respiration on the opposite side is exaogerated The percussion note varies; at first it is normal, or in some cases there may be hyper-resonance but in a short time the lung becomes congested and then there is diminished resonance, and sometimes complete dullness over the whole of the chest. Where the bronchus is not completely obstructed (hg. 269), the respiratory murmur is diminished but not abolished, and a whistling noise may sometimes be heard over the region of the bifurcation of the trachea, from the passage of air through a narrowed chink between h2 h^" ^-ffi '"r"^ °f I" >^'^"y <^ases, no doubt, skiagraphy will, in future, prove useful in deterrnining the presence and position of a foreign body. Treatment in these cases consists in performing a low tracheotomy and stitch- ing the edges of the wound in the trachea to the skin wound. If the foreign body is not expelled spontaneously in a day or two, the trachea and bronchi should be carefully explored with a long probe ; this may excite a violent fit of coughing, during which the foreign body may be expelled; or the patient may be inverted and at the same time sharply struck on the back oyer the region of the bifurca- tion. This may dislodge the foreign body. Failing this, the surgeon should attempt by delicate forceps, a hooked probe or loop of wire, to extract it. This is often a matter of extreme diffi- culty, the introduction of the instrument causing violent coughing, and the surgeon IS baffled in all his efforts. In those cases where the presence of the foreign body is overlooked, or where It cannot be removed, sooner or later in- flammation is apt to be set up. A cavity is formed around the foreign body in the substance of the lung.

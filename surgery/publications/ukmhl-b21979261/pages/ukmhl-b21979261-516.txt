490 INJURIES ANJ) DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES anastomosis, and differ from it only in the fact that they are partly lodged in the bone. (2) The other form of erectile tumour of bone consists of a cavity, generally hollowed out in the cancellous tissue of the ends of the long bones and containing blood. The bones forming the wall of this cavity are often a mere shell (fig. 177), and a very forcible pulsation may be communicated through it to the hand placed upon the enlarged end of the bone. It seems most probable, as first pointed out by Volkmann, that these are merely sarcomatous blood-cysts, composed of a thin envelope of sarcomatous tissue around a central mass of blood, and probably formed by an effusion of blood into a sarcoma, which becomes expanded over the collection of blood and forms a sort of cyst to it. In these cases the symptoms are the same as in a pul- sating sarcoma, though as a rule no bruit is present. The diagnosis between the two con- ditions is impossible, but this is of litde moment, as the treatment of the two is the same. Treatment.—When a pulsating tumour of bone occurs on one of the extremities, the part should be rendered bloodless and a free incision made into the tumour for the purpose of ascertaining the exact nature of the case. If it turns out to be an undoubted sarcoma, amputation should at once be performed. If it consists of blood with a thin envelope of sarcomatous material, it is proper to scrape the bony cavity thoroughly, so as to get nd of the envelope, and then pack it from the bottom with gauze. When the tumour occurs in the bones of the skull, probably the wiser course is not to undertake any operative in- terference.

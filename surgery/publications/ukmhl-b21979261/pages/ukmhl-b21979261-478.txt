452 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA Fracture of the patella is a common injury, and the bone may be broken in two distinct ways—by muscular action or by direct violence. As these two forms of fracture differ materially in many particulars, it is necessary to consider them separately. Fracture from muscular action.—This is the more common mode in which fracture of the patella is produced. The way in which it occurs is somewhat peculiar, as it always takes place while the leg is in a position of semiflexion. When this is so the patella rests on the front of the condyles of the femur, and if at this moment any sudden contraction of the quadriceps exten- sor takes place the bone is snapped across, much in the same way as a piece of stick may be broken across the knee. The fracture is there- fore always transverse ; almost always, if not always, complete; and the fibrous structures Fig. 158.—Transverse frac- ture of the patella, showing the displacement caused by the quadriceps extensor cruris.

(From ' A System of Surgery,' by Holmes and Hulke.) which cover it in front and the cartilage on its articular surface are also torn. The fibrous capsule on either side of the patella is also torn, and there is therefore great displacement, the upper fragment being drawn upwards by the quadriceps extensor (fig. 158), and retained by the effusion which takes place into the joint, first of blood and subsequently of inflam- matory exudation. The fracture generally takes place somewhere near the middle of the bone, but sometimes one fragment is much bigger than the other. The signs of this fracture are well marked. There is the history of a sudden slip and an effort to recover the equilibrium—the manner in which

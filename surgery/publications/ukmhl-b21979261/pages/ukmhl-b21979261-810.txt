772 INjURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS answers sufficiently well. Some surgeons recommend that the jacket should be applied while the spine is in a state of extension ; that is to say, while the patient if an adult, is suspended by the head and axilla on a suitably arranged tripod; or if a child, held up by the armpits. In my opinion this is not wise. By the time the case is ready for the jacket, a certain amount of consoUdation is expected to have taken place, and the effect of the extension will be to stretch this new cicatricial tissue and produce in it a condition of irritation. In this jacket the patient may be allowed to eat about It is the practice of some to treat all patients in this way, and Is soon as urgent symptoms have subsided, to get all of their patients up in a fixed apparatus and allow them to move about, under the plea that it is better for their general health. I do not think so. However well moulded a jacket may be, it does not so completely immobilise the spine as rest in bed, and after it has been in use for a short time it becomes bent out of shape, and then some movement at the seat of disease must take place It is quite erroneous to think that the patient's health, especially if a child, suffers from the confinement to bed, if its hygienic surroundings are eood Every-day experience proves that children suffermg from Pott s disease if they are kept in bed, improve in their general condition : they regain their colour, eat heartily and sleep well, and usually increase in weight and stature. . . u j j During the treatment the general health of the patient must be attended to The diet must be carefully regulated. Cod-liver oil and tonics may be considered necessary, and the bowels must be kept open Constipa- tion is often a considerable trouble in these cases. In children, it will often be found that a glycerine enema is the best remedy for this. The treatment of chronic abscesses in these cases has already been described (page ii8). In retro-pharyngeal abscess the opening is gene- rally best niadl behind the sterno-mastoid (see page 717)- ^ In psoas abscess the opening should always be made above Pouparts ligament, as the constricted part of the sac at this ligament prevents the proper dealing with the cavity and the thorough evacuation of all the pus. A second opening may be made below the ligament, if judged necessary. Mr. i reves has recommended that psoas abscesses should be opened o^"' the outer border of the erector spme. An openmg m this situat on possesses the advantage that when the disease is m the lumbar region the bodies of the vertebrje can be explored and if necessary scraped, or an) necrotic fragments removed. In the old days, when these abscesses wer more frequently drained than they are now, the opening was also in the rSiv Mr.^'vto'Ho^^^^^ has advocated a more radical treatment of spinal caries which has gone on to the formation of abscess we considers that the universally accepted treatment of tuberculous os it s in other parts of the body should be apphed to ^his <:ondition^^^t^^^^^^^^^ diseased bone should be exposed and removed, and the ^^^^ '^isinf so as to ensure, as far as possible, the destruction ^^'^^^y tubercle bac 1 that may have escaped removal.

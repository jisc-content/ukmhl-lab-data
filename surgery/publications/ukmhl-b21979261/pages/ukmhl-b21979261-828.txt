7tjo INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS Treatment—Until recently, wounds of the heart were regarded as beyond surgical treatment; but the recent experience of Dr. Parrozzani, of Rome, would seem to show that something may at all events be attempted Fig. 302.—Gunshot wound of the heart. (From the Museum of St. George's Hospital.) Fig. 303.—Punctured wound of the hgart. (From the Museum of St. George's Hospital.) in those cases which are not immediately fatal. A man who had been stabbed in the left side was admitted into hospital under the care of Dr. Parrozzani in a collapsed condition, with a scarcely perceptible pulse. An operation was performed at once. A flap comprising the whole thickness of the thoracic wall, and including portions of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, was turned inwards. The left pleural cavity was opened and found to be full of blood, and an opening an inch in length was seen in the pericardium. This was enlarged, and a stab in the left ventricle was found to have perforated the wall and entered the cavity. A finger could be passed through it into the cavity of the ventricle. The wound was closed with four sutures, then the pericardial wound was closed, and finally the external incision. The patient recovered completely. Considering that these wounds are almost always fatal, an attempt should be made to follow in Dr. Parrozzani's footsteps, in the hope that a like success might attend the effort. . Rupture of the heart, without external wound, occasionally occurs from severe blows or contusions of the chest It is followed by instantaneous death (fig. 304). Fig. 304.—Rupture of the heart.

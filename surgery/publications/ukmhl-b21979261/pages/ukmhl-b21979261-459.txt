The forearm must be in a position midway between supination and pronation. i i / Fracture of the condyles.-Fracture of either condyle may take place, but the external condyle is more frequently broken than the nternal. The fractures are generally the result of direct violence, but may also be produced by indirect force, more especially that of the outer condyle. This accounts for the greater frequency of fracture in this situation Fracture of the exteriial condyle.-The line of fracture generally runs from the external condylar ridge downwards and inwards to the groove which separates the capitellum from the rest of the articular surface (fie 144) When it is the result of indirect violence, it is produced by talis on the hand, the head of the radius being driven against the capitellum The fracture always involves the elbow joint. The displacement is not great, the fractured portion of bone being retained in position by the External lateral ligament. There is great pain and_ swelling, at first con- fined to the outer side of the joint, and crepitus is readily obtained by grasping the condyle, and moving it slightly on the subjacent bone. Fracture of the internal condyle.â€”Two fractures of the internal condyle may occur: one, intra-articular; the other, extra-articular. I he intrlarticular fracture extends from the internal condylar ridge down- wards and outwards to the middle of the trochlear surface (fig. 144)- ^he fractured portion of bone is displaced a little upwards and backwards, carrying the ulna with it, so that when the forearm is extended the olecranon projects behind the humerus, and the forearna is deflected to the ulnar side The elbow becomes swollen and painful, there is increased breadth between the condyles, and crepitus can be detected by seizing and moving the broken portion of bone. The movements of the elbow are

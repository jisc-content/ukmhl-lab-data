498 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES and Should be tried first, because there is less danger of doing injury to surrounding parts. It aims at making the displaced end of the bone retrace the steps by which it has become dislocated, by executmg certain movements of the limb. These movements are conducted in such a manner that they shall relax untorn ligaments, bring the end of the bone opposite the rent in the capsule, and in some instances by employing a ligament which is still intact as a fulcrum levering the head of the bone back into its socket. The special manipulations required will be described in deaUng with individual dislocations. . , , . , Extension has for its object the overcoming of muscular resistance and other impediments to reduction, by a superior force ; and by the apphcation of extension to the limb to forcibly drag the bone back into its normal position In order to do this effectually, counter extension has first to be mide generally by an assistant. Extension is made by the hands of the sumeon grasping the limb below the seat of dislocation ; or, if greater force is required by a bandage or jack-towel fastened to the limb by a clove-hitch knot Formerly, multiplying pulleys were much employed as a means of making extension, but they are rarely if ever used in the present day. The extension should be steady and continuous, and not made in jerks ; and combined with it a slight lateral or rocking movement may be given to the dislocated bone, which will assist in freeing the extremity and facilitat- ing reduction. Reduction is generally attended with a distinct and audible snao and the patient, if not under the influence of an anaesthetic, will often be conscious that the head of the bone has returned to its normal position. After the dislocation has been reduced, the part should be sup- ported in a convenient and comfortable position on a pillow or cus^hion, and massage at once commenced by gently stroking the parts with the pafm of the hand in the course of the venous circulation This mu t be done extremely hghtly so as not to cause pain; in fact if the patient has no been an^sthetised or has recovered from his anesthetic, he ought to experience rehef from the rubbing. At the first sitting this may be continued for fifteen or twenty minutes, and the hmb is then to be put on a splint, or bandaged in such a way as to prevent any movement. Each day the bandages Ind splints are to be removed and massage employed for half an hour ; and at the end of a week, passive motion is to be com- menced, at first gently and cautiously. In three weeks or a month the nat-ipnt mav be allowed to move his limb. . „ , ^ Unreduced dislocations.-If a dislocation is allowed to remain unre^uced^?re!t and important changes take P^.--J^^e muse es ligamentous structures around the joint become infiltrated ^^^^^ ^/^"Jf cicatricial material and shortened, so that reduction is -P°f . th^ out division or rupture of these structures.

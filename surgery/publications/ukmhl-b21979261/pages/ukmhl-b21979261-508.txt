INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES The bones most frequently and first affected are those of the pelvis, then- those of the spine, the chest, the lower and upper limbs, and finally, very rarely, the head. During the child-bearing period the disease appears to have a special predilection for the bones of the pelvis. Pathological anatomy.—The disease consists first of all in an absorp- tion of the earthy matter, and the bone becomes soft, and resembles one that has been soaked in mineral acids, but at this stage microscopic exa- mination shows traces of true bone structure. Subsequently this softened material undergoes a gelatinous transformation, and, being mixed with blood which has been poured out from vessels which have given way in the softened tissue, becomes altered, so that the whole bone is converted into a thin shell of compact tissue immediately beneath a thickened and vascular periosteum, filled with a brownish red, grumous, semi-fluid material Fig. 171.—Deformity of the pelvis—in A, rickets, and in B, osteo-malacia. which is not unlike splenic pulp. The bones during this process may become bent and altered in shape, or may break under the slightest violence, and in consequence of this the whole trunk may become greatly misshapen and distorted. The deformity which takes place in the pelvis is of the utmost importance in connection with child-bearing, and this part and the lower portions of the spine may be the only parts which are affected with this disease. The weight of the trunk causes an increase in the sacro-vertebral angle, and a lessening of the antero-posterior diameter of the inlet, and from the same cause the pressure of the acetabula on the heads of the femora causes these cavities with the adjacent bone to be pushed upwards and backwards, so that the oblique diameters are also diminished, and the cavity of the pelvis assumes a triradiate shape, with the .symphysis pubis carried forwards (fig. 171).

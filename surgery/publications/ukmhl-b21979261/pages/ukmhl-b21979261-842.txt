8o4 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS Rupture of the spleen (fig. 313)-—I" rupture of the spleen the case very frequently terminates fatally on account of the exceedingly friable and vascular nature of the organ. It is especially liable to occur when the viscus is enlarged as the result of exposure to a mala- rious climate, and is often associated with fractured ribs. There is great shock, accom- panied by the signs of internal haemorrhage, with the history of an injury on the left side and probably a bruise in the left hypo- chondrium. There is a large fixed area of dullness on percussion in this situation from extravasated blood. Treatment.—If the diagnosis is fairly clear that the spleen has been ruptured, the abdo- men should be opened. If the wound in the spleen is small, an endeavour may be made to close it with silk or catgut sutures, but this is not always easy on account of the friable nature of the organ, so that in most cases, especially if hsemorrhage is still going on, it is better to stuff the rent with a long strip of iodoform gauze, the end of which is allowed to hang out of the wound as a drain. If the organ has been extensively damaged, it must be removed. Several successful cases of splenectomy for rupture have been recorded. Rupture of the liver (fig. 3i4).-The liver is more frequently ruptured than any other of the abdominal viscera. This no doubt is due, to a great extent, to its large size and unyielding nature, but also to the Fig. 313.—Rupture of the spleen. (From the Museum of St. George's Hospital.)

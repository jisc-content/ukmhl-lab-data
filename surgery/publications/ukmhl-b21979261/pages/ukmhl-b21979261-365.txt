LIGATURE OF THE COMMON CAROTID 339 upwards by the side of the trachea, and may give rise to dyspncea, and by pressure on the sympathetic and recurrent laryngeal nerves cause a contracted pupil on the affected side, and hoarseness and loss of voice Ihrough interference with the circulation in the brain, it may cause giddiness or stupor. The pulse in the temporal artery on the affected side IS weaker and smaller than on the opposite side, while the two radial Dulses are the same. '■ ' Tf .1^*^ treatment of carotid aneurism must depend upon its situation If the aneurism is at the root of the neck, low down in the carotid, distal ligature by Brasdor's method (fig. 103) is the plan of operative treatment which IS indicated, but this should not be adopted until a fair trial has been made of constitutional treatment, since, as we have already pointed out, the distal ligature does not hold out very strong prospects of cure Nevertheless If there are any cases in which Bmsdor? SpSn is likely to do good, It IS in aneurism in this situation. If, on the other hand the aneurism is in the situation where carotid aneurisms are most usuallJ found, near the bifurcation of the artery, then digital compression should ahvays first be resorted to, if practicable, before any attempt to ligatu e the artery on the cardiac side is undertaken.

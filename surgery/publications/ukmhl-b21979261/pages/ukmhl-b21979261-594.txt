568 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES that on the opposite side, but will look flattened and depressed and the Gluteal fold at the back of the thigh will be wholly or partially obliterated. This is in a great measure due to wasting of the gluteal muscles but no doubt also to a certain extent to the flexed position of the limb Fhe other muscles of the limb are also wasted, and this wasting is manifest at a very early period of the disease, within a few weeks after its_ commencement. The amount of pain in tuberculous disease of the hip vanes: m the grea er number the pain is either very slight or there is none at all, except after using the Unib ; in others the disease sets in with pain, sometimes of an acuti character. The pain is often referred to the knee, that is, to the peripheral termination of the obturator nerve, which supplies both joints. As the disease progresses the pain increases, and the patient complains whenever the joint is moved. Starting pains occur at night and the wasth'g of the limb becomes more marked. The position of the limb l altered â€¢ while the flexion still remains, the limb becomes adducted and turned inwards, so that the direction of the axis of the femur is across the sound thigh. When this condition of things comes about the patient nstinc vely, if left alone, lies on his sound side, with the affected limb thrown across ts fe low, and the knee resting upon the bed beyond it, 1 he cause of thTs change in position is not very clear, but it is usually said to be due to the actio^ of the adductors and internal _ rotators overcoming the resist- ance of the external rotators and the posterior part of the capsule, wh ch have been weakened by the inflammatory changes which have taken place L them In consequence of this change from abduction to adduction the pelvis is now tilted upwards, and there is apparent shortening of the hmb when the thighs are parallel. During this stage of the disease there s a certain amount of constitutional disturbance : the tempera ure is sligh ly above normal in the evening, and there is loss of flesh and genera deterioration in the condition of the child.

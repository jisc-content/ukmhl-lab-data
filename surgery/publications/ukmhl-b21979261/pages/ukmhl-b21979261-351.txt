DIAGNOSIS OF ANEURISM 325 beats will regain its original size. The pulse in the limb below the swelling is smaller than on the sound side and is somewhat delayed. A sphygmo- graphic tracing (fig. 96) shows the pulse to be much less abrupt in its rise, and to be more rounded. The pain of an aneurism varies very much. In many cases a deep boring, burning pain is complained of in the part, due to hw M An K inflammatory conditions in the tissues j\ \ l\ j\ around, and to the tension to which ^^""^ the parts are subjected. Where bones are pressed upon and are becoming absorbed, the pain is often of a pecu- liarly excruciating character. In addi- Fig. 96.—Sphygmographic tracing of tion to this there is often pain com- ^^'^ ''^"^'^^ P"'^^ °" two sides of plained of in the peripheral terminations t subclavian of any nerves Li may be pressed T™;„ .^^cS. upon by the tumour. In consequence of pressure upon the vein accompanying the artery on which the aneurism IS situated, there is very often redema of the parts below, and a varicose condition of the superficial veins. The diagnosis of external aneurism is usually simple, and in most cases it IS coniparatively easy to avoid errors in diagnosis ; but, at the same time, it must be admitted that in some cases the diagnosis is very difficult and this IS still more so with internal aneurisms where there is often no bruit and where no pulsation can be felt, and where indeed there are often no symptoms except those produced by pressure. An aneurism may be mis- taken for a solid or cystic tumour lying near an artery and deriving pulsa- tion from it; such, for instance, as a cystic bronchocele deriving pulsation horn the carotid or innominate artery, or an enlarged bursa in the ham deriving pulsation from the popHteal; but attention to the essential features enumerated above ought to prevent the surgeon from falling into error in these cases. The fact that these tumours do not diminish in size when the circulation IS arrested in the vessel above; that there is no expansile pulsation- merely the up and down movement communicated to them by the arterv all nTlt ' '"^ "^""^ly di^Pl^^^d from the aLry, when all pul ation ceases, is sufficient to establish the diagnosis. But it is in cases of malignant tumours growing from bones that the greatest d ffiJultv is experienced. These often contain large spaces filled wfth blood and Dul sate on account of their great vascularify. In addition to this thZ RontgenW^ would nrlf^tl.ytif.tlhe Sa^S'^"''' '"^ :o,r5^^irLrH--~^^

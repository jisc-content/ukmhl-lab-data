PREFACE via for it wSs found impossible, if the work was to be kept within the Hmits determined upon, to allude to all the plans of treatment which have been recommended at different times for different diseases. Most of the illustrations have been drawn by Dr. Harvey Goldsmith, one of my former pupils ; some from preparations or drawings in the Museum of St. George's Hospital, which I have been accustomed to use in order to illustrate my subject; others from rough sketches made by myself, such as I have been in the habit of drawing on the blackboard during the delivery of my lectures. I feel that my best thanks are due to Dr. GOLDSMITH for the great pains he has bestowed on his work, and for the artistic finish which he has given to my crude sketches. Some few illustrations have been borrowed from other sources, and these have been acknowledged in the text. My best thanks are also due to my friend Mr. C. R. Keyser, Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. George's Hospital, and to my son, Mr. Lawrence Pick, for assistance in correcting the proofs, and for many valuable suggestions made by them in passing these pages through the press.

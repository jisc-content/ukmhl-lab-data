■^82 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS eroded- The disease is characterised by aching pain in the joint, which is worse at night and in damp weather; there is enlargement and deformity in front of the tragus of the ear, and grating on moving the joint. When the disease is unilateral the chin is deflected to one side. Occasionally a partial displacement of the condyle takes place if the patient incautiously opens the mouth widely, causing pain and discomfort. _ Treatment—The treatment is unsatisfactory. Counter irritation some- times affords a certain amount of relief, and attention should be paid to preserving as far as possible the movements in the joint. In the later stages excision has been attended with satisfactory results. Closure of the jaw may be due to several different conditions, (i) Spasvi of the muscles of the jaw, induced by irritation of the third division of the fifth cranial nerve from an impacted wisdom tooth, or carious teeth or some other local condition, producing spasm of the muscles of mastication. Closure of the jaw is also sometimes simulated in hysterical women. The condition is known as trismus, and is usually remedied by removing the cause. (2) Inability to open the jaw often arises from inflammatory conditions, such as alveolar abscess, mumps &c Contraction diie to cicatrices is another cause of closure of the javvs These contractions may be due to the healing of extensive sloughing from cancrum oris, or to scars on the cheek from burns or extensive lupus or gunshot injuries. It may also arise after extensive operations for the removal of epithehoma or rodent ulcer. (4) Closure of the jaw may be due to ankylosis of the temporo-mandibular joint from disease in this articulation. The ankylosis may be fibrous or bony and the diagnosis between the two can generally be made when the patiekt is under an anaesthetic. In some cases when the ankylosis is not very firm, the adhesions may be broken down by forcibly opemng the jaws under an anaesthetic, but the operation is frequently attended with unsatis- factory results, as it is exceedingly difficult to prevent reunion. In the majority of cases some cutting operation will have to be resorted to. 1 tie two operations usually performed are •. (i) Esmarch's operation of removal of a wedge of bone from the neighbourhood of the angle of the jaw; (2) excision of the condyle. . I Esmarch's operation is generally to be preferred especially when there are scars in the neighbourhood of the condyle, which render excision not only difficult, but useless; or when there are cicatrices within the mouth from destruction of the mucous surface. An "icision is mad. about 2 or i\ inches in length along the lower border of the jaw ftom .he angle The^soft parts are then raised from the bone as far as the alveolar border, and a triangular wedge of bone, with its periosteum, is sawn out: the apex of the wedge corresponding to the alveolar border. Atter tne operation passive movement must be commenced early. 2.

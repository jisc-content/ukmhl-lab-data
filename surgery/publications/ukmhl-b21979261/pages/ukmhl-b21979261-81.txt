55 UNION BY SECOND INTENTION exudation of inflammatory products goes on until the surface of the wound becomes covered with a very thick layer of mflammatory exudation Owing to the fact that the superficial part of this layer is far removed from any source of nutritive supply, it undergoes degeneration from mal- nutrition and becomes converted into pus, which escapes from the surface of the wound: but the deeper part, being nearer the source of nutritive supply, undergoes a developmental process and becomes converted into granulations. If the surface of a wound at this stage is examined, little red points will be seen studding it; these increase and coalesce till the whole of the wound may be seen to present a red, velvety appearance from the formation of a number of papillary looking bodies, which are known as ^ranulatio7ts. These resemble embryonic tissue in their power of growth, and gradually increase in size and number until they fill up the space left by the gaping wound. The manner in which these granulations are formed is by the growing upwards into the deeper layers of the inflammatory exuda- tion of little buds from the blood-vessels in the tissue beneath, exactly in the same manner as occurred in the vascularisation of the lymph, in union by first intention. These buds form loops, and wherever a loop is formed it pushes the exudation before it, so that it forms a little hillock or pyramid, consi.sting of a capillary loop, surrounded by a mass of round cellsâ€”the original plasma cells of the exudation material (fig. ii). These granula- tions gradually fill up the wound, and as the deeper parts become protected from irritation by the more superficial granulations, they undergo a conversion into fibrous or scar tissue by the same process as that already described in union by the first intention. As soon as this new fibrous tissue has formed it begins to contract and narrows the wound, so that by the time the whole of the granulations which fill the wound have become converted into fibrous tissue, the scar tissue, which now closes it, is considerably smaller than the size of the original wound; and, contraction still going on for some considerable time after the healing process is completed, a large gaping wound, or a wound where there has been

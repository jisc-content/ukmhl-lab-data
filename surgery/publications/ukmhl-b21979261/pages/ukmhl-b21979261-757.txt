It usually occurs in individuals advanced in life, and rarely if ever before the age of forty. It is found more frequently in the male than in the female. Its most common situation is at the commencement of the oesophagus, behind the cricoid cartilage, but it is also not infrequently found about the middle of the tube, where it crosses the left bronchus, or at its cardiac extremity, and may indeed be found in any part of the canal.

928- INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS in and distend the bladder, theviscus must be washed out periodically with a large-eyed catheter. If symptoms of peri-nephritic abscess supervene, an incision must be made in the loin, and the kidney dealt with according to the condition found. . ■ •, j Wounds of the kidney are very rare m civil practice, and not common in warfare. When inflicted from behind they do not involve the peritoneum, unless perhaps in gunshot wounds, when the bullet passes completely through the kidney; but when the wound is in front, the peritoneum and very often some of the other viscera are injured. The symptoms are those of collapse, with severe pain in the loin, often radiating to the testicle and thigh. There may be profuse bleeding from the external wound, or if it is of the nature of a punctured wound, blood may collect in the tissues around the kidney ; or, if the peritoneum is wounded, in the peritoneal cavity. There is usually constant desire to pass water and the urine may or may not contain blood. If the peritoneum IS iniured, symptoms of peritonitis speedily come on ; if it is not injured, inflammation of the retro-peritoneal tissue, running on to suppuration, is ^'^^feeatmeX-^If hemorrhage is not excessive and the wound has been inflicted from behind, it should be thoroughly irrigated with solution of corrosive sublimate (i in i,ooo) or carbolic acid (i m 20) and a large drainage tube inserted, the rest of the wound being closed; if the hemor- rhage is great and persistent, the wound in the lom should be enlarged and the kidney exposed and dealt with as in the cases of rupture. If the iniury is in front, the abdomen should be opened, not only in order to deal with the kidney, but also with any other viscus which may be iniured If the iniury is extensive, and the bleedmg profuse, the organ may have to be removed; if the injury is sHghter in its nature and the bleeding not profuse, the wound in the kidney must be sutured and the oS^^g in the peritoneum closed over it. The peritoneal cavity must then be thoroughly cleansed of all blood clots and flushed and the abdominal wound closed. The patient should be kept ^o^^Pl^l.^^ly f^Jf^J^ opium or morphia may be given to allay pain, and only small quantities of fluid food given by the mouth. . f „rPtPr ic; Rupture of the ureter .-Subcutaneous rupture of the ureter is not aXmon injury, and when it occurs is usually the -uU o direct violence, as a kick from a horse, or the passage of ^^^^eel over the tm It may either be torn completely across or only partially divided and he peritoneum usually escapes injury If it is torn complete ^cros^he urine collects in the retro-peritoneal tissues If it is not t^^^^^^^ f ^ across it may become obstructed, and hydro-nephrosis or Pyo-"ei*r^^^^^^^^^ result.

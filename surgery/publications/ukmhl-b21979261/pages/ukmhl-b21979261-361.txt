Temporary ligature.—One other plan of applying a ligature to an artery for the cure of aneurism requires a passing notice. It has been pro- posed to apply some temporary compressing force to an artery, which shall impede the flow of blood through the vessel without occluding it. This may be done in several ways : by passing an acupressure needle under the vessel and a figure-of-8 ligature over it and under the needle; or by exposing the vessel, passing a silver wire under it, and bringing the ends out through the skin some distance from the wound and twisting them over a piece of cork, with sufficient tension to impede without completely obstructing the current of the blood. Special instruments, e.g. Dix's wire compressor and Spiers' artery constrictor, have been devised for the same purpose. The plan of treatment appears, however, to possess no advantage over the permanent ligature, and to possess the distinct disadvantage that a clot may form m the vessel above the constricting force, and that when this is released the clot may be carried onwards and impacted in some vessel in the course of the circulation. We have now to consider very briefly the various other plans which have been recommended at different times for the cure of aneurism 3. Excision.—Complete extirpation of an aneurismal sac is theoreti- cally the best and most satisfactory method of deahng with an aneurism and It is a plan of treatment which has been recently revived by some surgeons. It is not, however, always practicable, and under most circum- stances IS an operation which is beset with difficulties. The ideal nlan IS to remove the tumour without opening it; first securing the artery bv ligature above and below, and also any branches which may open into the sac; but this IS not always possible on account of the adhesions to other structures which may exist. The operation seems especially applicable to the treatment of small aneurisms of the third part of the suLlavian artery The results of some cases in which this operation has been recently neT- formed have been very satisfactory. iecenriy per 4- Manipulation.—This plan of treatment was introduced by Sir William Fergusson,_and aims at displacing a portion of clot from thrsac of th^ aneurism into the mouth of the sac or the vessel below. As we hive already seen, spontaneous cure of an aneurism is sometimes broughTabout by this means, and the object of this operation is to imitate naturf in t-hl respect.

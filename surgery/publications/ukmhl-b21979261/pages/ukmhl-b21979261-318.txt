292 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES the bandage may be applied so tightly as to arrest the whole circulation in the par^ and total giigrene of it may ensue Again, if the apex of the graduated or conical compress is not placed directly on the wounded a ?erj, blood will continue to escape and collect around the vesse, and this may lead to the formation o a traumatic aneurism^ 1 he practice, therefore, of attempting to arrest haemorrhage from a wound of a Ce or medium-sized artery by a compress and bandage is now almost a thing of the past. Perhaps the only cases m which such a proceeding is advfsable s where secondary hemorrhage occurs after ligature of an artery in ks continuity, and this is nowadays happily an accident which is almost ''"'TForcipressure.-There are few things in the practice of modern surgery which add more to the comfort of a surgeon in operatuig than the nvSn by Spencer Wells of the 'clip forceps and the introduction of fo cipressure^ These forceps are merely ^^^mary dressing forceps provided with a catch, so that when a portion of tissue is seized by them d^ev retain their hold. When an _ operation is to be performed the assistant to the operator provides himself with several pairs of these d p forceps and as soon as a vessel is cut seizes the open mouth with them! clones the catch, and allows them. to remain hanging from the wound.

712 INfURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS Acute abscess of the neck may be diffused or circumscribed. It is usually set up by inflammation of the lymphatic glands. Ihe course which' the pus will take depends upon its position with regard to the cervical fascia. In many cases it has burst into the trachea or oesophagus, and even into the pleura, and in some instances the great vessels of the neck have been opened up. This, no doubt, is on account of the tough character of the cervical fascia, which prevents the escape of the matter through it and causes it to burrow laterally and destroy the tissues with which it comes m contact. Acute abscesses in the neck should herefore be opened early; indeed, in these cases it is wiser to incise the hard, brawny swelling at once, without waiting for any evidence of fluctuation, and take means to prevent the closing of the incision by inserting a drainage ^""^ AnfiEina of Ludwig is a form of cellulitis of the connective tissue beneath the deep cervical fascia in the submaxillary region, which comes on without any apparent reason, but which is no doubt due to a specific noison It commences with a brawny induration m the submaxillary region' with great constitutional disturbance, and generally a rigor it telds 'to spread into the mouth, pushing the tongue upwards and back- wards, and interfering with respiration and deglutition. It also tends to spread downwards into the neck, and dangerous symptoms are often produced by pressure on important vessels and nerves; it may spread h wards to the glottis, producing oedema, which may cause the death of the p^^^^^^^^^^^ suff-ocation. It runs a rapid course, is accompanied by ex reme depression, and usually terminates fatally in a few days from sepric intoxication. If the patient survive longer, extensive sloughing and suDDuration ensue, and the matter burrows in every direction. ^Treatment—A free incision must be made at once into the brawny tissues, and these must be thoroughly opened up^ ^^^^^Tentf Sra Rth provided, and hot antiseptic fomentations applied. The patient s strength must be supported by plenty of fluid nourishment, and stimulants and Quinine given in large doses. , • Chronic abscess of the neck is of common occurrence, and is usuSly thf Jesuit of the caseation and breaking down of tuberculous glands.

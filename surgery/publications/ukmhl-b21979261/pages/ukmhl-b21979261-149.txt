There is, however, a process which is termed dSratTon which is not inflammatory, where the same process is going on, b"e'the invading cells which destroy and i.plac.e the normal .sue are not leucocytes, but another variety of cells. 1 his is tne so caiiea ulcera° on of malignant tumours, where the special cells of the malignan growth enact the role of the leucocytes, and invade and destroy the normal fissues. It would save confusion if some other name could be adopted for this process, which is clearly not inflammatory.

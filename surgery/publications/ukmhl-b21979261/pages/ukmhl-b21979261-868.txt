The surgical treatment of gall stones.—After medi- cal treatment has been fully tried and failed in cases of gall stones, surgical measures should be resorted to. The principal indications for opera- tive interference are as follows: (i) in cases of recurring biliary colic, which have resisted medical treatment, with or without enlargement of the gall bladder, and unaccom- panied by jaundice; (2) in enlargement of the gall bladder, without jaundice, even if unaccompanied by much pain ; (3) in persistent jaundice, where there are attacks of pain, accompanied by exacerbations of the jaun- dice ; (4) in empyema of the gall bladder, or abscess in its neighbour- hood ; (0 in biliary fistulce. , It is often impossible to say what operative proceedings will have to be undertaken until the abdominal cavity has been opened. They maj-^oe comprised under the following : (i) cholecystotomy, (2) choledochotom>, (t.) cholecystenterostomy, (4) cholecystectomy. • • „ I Cholecystotomy is undertaken for the purpose of draining he bladder or removing calculi (cholelithotom).) The patient is placed in th supine position with a firm pillow or sandbag under his back at the e^ el of^the Uver, so as to bring the gall bladder and ducts fo-va^ds, and a th^^ same time to cause the intestines to slip away from the liver.

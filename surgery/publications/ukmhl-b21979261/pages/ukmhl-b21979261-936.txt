SgS INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS introduced into the rectum, and this is all that is necessary to effect a In other cases an imperforate anus may be present, and this may assume several different forms, for the right understanding of which it is necessary to allude briefly to the mode of development of this portion of the intestinal canal. The rectum is developed from the lower part of the hind gut, which is the closed tube at the caudal end of the inflection of the blastodermic layers from which the alimentary canal is formed. This grows down into the pelvis of the embryo, carrying the terminal branch of the inferior mesenteric artery with it, and meets an in- flection of the epiblast, which takes place at the situation of the future anus. The two por- tions are at first separated by the closed ends of the twa ceecal tubes, but subsequently a solution of the septum takes place and the two tubes com- municate. The following are the prin- cipal varieties of imperforate anus, which may arise from some imperfection in the de- velopment of these parts. I. The septum between the two portions of embryonic gut —the end of the hind gut and the involuted epiblast—known as the proctodcEum—may not become dissolved. Under these circumstances, the external parts will be found to be natural and the anus fully formed, but the child cannot defecate.

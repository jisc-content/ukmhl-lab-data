Mechanical unrest may be due to the presence of a foreign body; to tension of the part rom too tight sutures ; to constant movement; to draggmg on the wound from the weight of the limb ; to a too tight bandage ; to passive congestion from the dependent position of the part interfering with the return of the venous blood!'or to many other apparently minor circumstances which mechanically interfere with absolute rest of the tissues. They may appear to be tnvia and scarcely worthy of notice, but the careful recognition and remova lo them may make all the diff-erence between the successful and non-successfui termination of the case. The surgeon who desires a favourable mode ot union to his wounds after operation must not fail to pay strict attention to these minuti^, if he would obtain for his patient a condition of complete rest, without which a continuance of the inflammation will be mamtained. The most important variety of unrest in a wound is that due to the irritation produced by the introduction into it of some chemical substance, iiiese may be irritants introduced by the surgeon, but this ought rarely to be the case, for when a wound is aseptic, as an operation wound ought to be, it is unnecessary to inject irritating antiseptic solutions into it to destroy micro-organisms which do not exist, and therefore the only chemical irritants which we need consider are those which result from the growth ot bacteria in the wound. The bacteria which act in this way, and which keep up a condition of unrest in the part, are of two diff"erent kinds ; one ot these is the pyogenic organisms, which promote suppuration and which belong to the order of cocci; these will be considered more in detail when we come to speak of suppuration ; and the other is certain saprophy ic bacteria, which act as the ferment in promoting putrefaction, and which oy their growth generate certain chemical substances of an exceedingly poibon- ous character These organisms are introduced from without either by he surgeon's hands, sponges, or instruments, or grow in from he s^in ot the patient, or they may enter with the dust from the air, though this is not com- mon, for, as we have already seen, they perish when dried; or hey may be introduced in the water, which is a favourite habitat of some of these micio-

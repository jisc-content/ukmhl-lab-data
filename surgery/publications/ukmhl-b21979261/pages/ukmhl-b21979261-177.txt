The great predisposing cause of erysipelas as regards the patient him- self is a vitiated condition of the blood. This may be and often is, due_ to habi ual Intemperance; the man who is in the habit of taking an excessive amount of aTcoholic stimulants is particularly Uable to be attacked with enSas But the vitiated condition maybe set up by other causes; amongst the poor, privation of the necessaries of hfe and want of suffi-en and proper food maybe the disposing cause ; so again, morbid states of the blood induced by disease of the eliminatory organs, e.g. albuminuria, dia- betes, and disease of the liver, are frequent predisposing causes of erysipelas. Mental emotions, and especially prolonged anxiety, by depressing the nervous system, is also a cause of erysipelas. It is sometimes said tha certain individuals are naturally predisposed to the disease and Verneuil records a case of a woman who had seventy-nine attacks ot erysipelas ot the face. Probably, however, these recurring cases are to be explained by the fact that the patient suffers from one of the predisposing causes above mentioned, which induces the attack. ^ r .u^^ As regards the patient's surroundings, it is a well-proved tact that erysipelas may become epidemic, as the result of some conditions ot the atmosphere; it is said to be more common in the spring and autumn and during the prevalence of east winds, but all that is known for certain is that the disease is more prevalent at some seasons than at others. More potent causes are bad ventilation and faulty hygienic conditions, and

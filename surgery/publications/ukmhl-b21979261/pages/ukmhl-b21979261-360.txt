334 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL TISSUES inDlicable Nowadays there is a growiiif^ tendency on the part of surgeons to revive this old operation, with the important addition that the sac is excised Now that the dangers from haemorrhage and sepsis can be avoided, the operation holds out much greater prospects of a success ul Lue, aAd, if successful, must result in a cure of the aneurism But at the same time it possesses two serious disadvantages : one_ is that there is Seat danger of wounding important structures m the neighbourhood; the other that when the aneurism is deeply seated it is very difficult of execu- Son The operation may be performed after the inethod of Antyllus, by lying open the sac, turning out the clots and searchuig for the artery from Sn • or, what would appear to be a better plan when practicable to exDO e th^ sac of the aneurism, isolate it by careful dissection from he fractures around, then ligaturing the arteries communicatmg with he aiSurism, dividing them between the ligature and the sac, and lifting the aneurism out without opening it. _ Anel's operation is seldom done except in those cases where the Humerian operation is not applicable. It differs from the operation of ligaturing the artery some distance above the sac m the fact that it leaves f eu rent through the aneurism, except the slight and weak reflux from the artery below. The advantages of the Hunterian operation over this have alreadv been considered. . ^. j- ^. i The distal ligature.-There are two 7)'%°^--P^^y^^Vasdor's lieature which differ somewhat in their mode of action. Brasdor s oipration consists in tying the artery on the distal side of the aneurism 3 between i andte first large branch (see fig. 103). It is almost entirely confined to the treatment of aneurisms of the lower part of the common carotid artery, where we have a long vessel without any branches, and there- fore room fo? a ligature to be applied between the aneurism and the bifurca- tion of the artery It resembles in its mode of action the spontaneous c^e effected V the dislodgment of a clot from an aneurism and its iZaction in the artery below. After ligature the clot formed on the cTrdiac side of the ligature may extend along the vessel into the sac, and th s togeth^^ with the lessened tension in the aneurism caused by the diversfon of the blood current, may succeed in curing the aneurism The ODeradon t however, rarely successful. Though it may succeed in check- trprogress of the aneurism for a time, it will in most cases eventually be^'found that the improvement was only temporary, and the sac will begin WardrSp^ operation is based on a rather different principle. It aim^at d^mSfng ^thout entirely arresting the current of blood through rLeurmal sacf by tying some but not all the bra-^es comi^^^^^ the diseased vessel (see fig. 102). For example, in an aneurism ot tne nnorSnate artery, the common carotid and the third portion of the sub- ckvi^n may be tied, still leaving a current of blood flowing through the sac of t^eTeu Lm to reach the branches given off from the first and second par^ S tl^r^iihclavian artery.

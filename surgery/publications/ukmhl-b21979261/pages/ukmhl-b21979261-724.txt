688 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS if tl.e membrana tympani is perforated the air will be heard passing throlih the opening with a whisthng sound. Ihe patency of the EuShian tubi may be further tested by directing the patient to close the mouth and compress the nostrils with his finger and thumb ; if he now makes a forced expiration he will be conscious of the air impinging " against the tympanic membrane. , r ■ ■ ^ Furd.erm^or| in examining a patient for deafness it is necessary to ascertain whether the conducting channels or the auditory apparatus are at S and this is to be done by the tuning fork. If a vibrating tuning fork irheld firnily against the skull, and the vibrations are heard clearly, though the ear is deaf to vibrations conveyed through the meatus, i is clear that the conducting media are at fault and not the auditory apparatus. I i?woftl y of note that, in cases of unilateral deafness arising from some lesioHi t\e conducting apparatus, the vibrations of the tuning fork are more di tinct on the affected side.

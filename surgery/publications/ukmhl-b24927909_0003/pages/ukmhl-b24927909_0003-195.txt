ON EMPHYSEMA. 185 In whatever state the lungs happen to be when they are wounded, a bandage, it it can be borne, seems therefore to me extremely useful. By means of it, the pain and irrita- tion which the motion of the fractured ribs must otherwise occasion, are, in a great mea- sure, or entirely, prevented. In that state of the lungs which I have first described, the pressure of a bandage prevents emphy- sema, and does no harm ; in the other, it not only prevents emphysema, but does good, by keeping the collapsed lung at rest, and thereby free from the necessity of con- stantly transmitting air. Patients, however, will not always be able to wear a bandage when one lung is collapsed (particularly if any previous disease has existed in the other), as it equally confines the motion of the ribs on both sides, and as every possible enlarge- ment of the chest becomes necessary for the due admission of air into the lun<T which still executes its functions. Under these circum- stances, if the emphysema continues (and its continuance must always denote that the wound in the lung is not closed), I should esteem it the best practice to make a small open-

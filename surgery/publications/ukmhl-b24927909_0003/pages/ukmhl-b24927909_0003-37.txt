ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 29 beaten in to the depth of a quarter of an inch, and starred or broken into many fragments. By dividing the scalp, I had the power of reflecting a portion of the integuments, so that I could trephine the bone, and remove the shattered and depressed pieces. I also took out a clot of coagulated blood as large as a walnut. The wound was closed by sticking-plaster, a compress laid over the part, and bound on by sticking-plaster. The patient was largely bled, and a dose of purgative medicine was given. It was difficult to determine whether the sleepy and stupid state of the patient was chiefly the effect of the injury or inebriety. She complained loudly during the operation. The next day, when the students of the hospital wished to examine whether the dressings were displaced or not, she refused to permit them ; but on my entering the ward, she said, “ Aye, now he is come, you may examine if you please.” I need only add further, that a treatment calculated to prevent and control inflammation was strictly persevered in, and that the patient shortly became perfectly well.

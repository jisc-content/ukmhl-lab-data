CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. 161 do an acceptable service by giving an en- graving of them. I therefore made two drawings of them; one exhibiting their most simple course ; the other, their most com- plicated distribution. These, I conclude, are the only nerves liable to injury. It may be suspected that the median nerve might oc- casionally be wounded; but its situation, I think, makes this opinion improbable. If, however, a doubt should be entertained on this subject, an attention to symptoms will soon dispel it: when a nerve is irritated at any part between its origin and termination, a sensation is felt as if some injury were done to the parts which it supplies. If, therefore, the cutaneous nerves were injured, the in- teguments of the fore-arm would seem to suffer pain ; but if the median nerve was wounded, the thumb and two next fingers would be affected with pain. By referring to the plate it will be seen, that if the patient be bled in the vena me- diana basilica, the branches of the internal cutaneous nerve are exposed to injury ; or, if the vena mediana cephalica be opened, the vol. in. m branches

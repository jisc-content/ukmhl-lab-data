ON FISTULA IN THE PERINEUM. 267 to introduce a very fine elastic catheter, and, by enlarging its size weekly, the urethra regained its natural calibre in all it parts ; so that the patient voided his urine in a larger stream, and with more freedom and force than he had done for fifty preceding years.

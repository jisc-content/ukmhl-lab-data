ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 23 those two injuries, will be noticed hereafter. At present it is only necessary to observe, that, as the effects of the latter gradually abate, a little delay will enable the surgeon to decide upon the nature of the mischief, and take his measures accordingly. Where the patient retains his faculties, nothing farther is neces- sary than a continuance of the antiphlogistic plan; and should any inflammation after- wards take place, the same means, employed in a degree proportioned to the urgency of the symptoms, will in most instances be suc- cessful without elevating the bone. This hap- pened in four of the six foregoing cases, which are related without any view to this particular point. — But if, from a peculiar disposition of the brain to be affected by pressure, the torpor of that organ should continue; or if, after inflammation of the brain has taken place, the pressure should then appear to be particularly injurious, the elevation of the bone ought not, I think, to be deferred.

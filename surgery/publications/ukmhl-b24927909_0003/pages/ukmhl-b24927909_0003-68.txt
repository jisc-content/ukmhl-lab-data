60 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAET. Where no bad symptoms precede the ap- pearance of the tumour, or where they go entirely away upon its being freed from the confinement of the dura mater, it may, per- haps, be most prudent not to interfere in the treatment of the complaint: for probably the haemorrhage will cease, and the coagulum will drop off in pieces *, or gradually waste away, and be no more renewed, f All that appears necessary, then, under such circum- stances, is to cover the tumour and sore with some mild dressing, carefully avoiding all pressure, which both reason and experience show is likely to be attended with bad con- sequences. Should the bulk of the tumour, however, become inconvenient, or render pressure from the dressings unavoidable, the practice which present experience has shown * See a case in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries,, vol. i. p. 98., where the tumour continued to increase for fourteen days, and had acquired the size of a goose’s egg, when it dropped oft'in pretty large pieces. A similar case is related in the Medical Museum, vol. iv. p. 463. f Fabricius Hildanus relates a case in his fifteenth Observation, where the tumour arising from the brain became, in 24 hours, as large as a hen’s egg, and after- wards gradually disappeared. to

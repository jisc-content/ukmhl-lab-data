ON EMPHYSEMA. 172 skin to let out the air ; and the emphysema did not afterwards spread. The patient was bled largely ; but the difficulty of breathing had increased to the third day, at which time I first saw her, in company with Mr. Harvey, under whose care she was. She had passed the preceding night without the least sleep, and breathed at this time with extreme dif- ficulty ; indeed it seemed as if she could not long continue the labour of such im- perfect and distressful respiration. It was supposed that one side of the thorax was filled with air; and as it was suspected that the opposite lung might be oppressed by this cause, it was agreed to extract the air from the right side of the chest. With this view, Mr. Harvey made an opening into the thorax, in the following manner: He first made an incision about two inches in length through the integuments, near the middle of the seventh rib, and op- posite to its lower edge. He then drew the skin upwards, so as to expose the in- tercostal muscles which connect the upper edge of this rib to the one above it. These he cautiously divided, as he next did the 18 pleura.

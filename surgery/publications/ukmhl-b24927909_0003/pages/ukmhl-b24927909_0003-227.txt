ON THE TIC DOULOUREUX. 217 nerves be supposed in those animals who pos- sess them to be the chief, if not the sole or- gans for the preparation of this subtile mat- ter, then it appears as necessary that the nerves should communicate, as that the arte- ries should do so. For if the continuity of the trunk of either of these organs were de- stroyed, the parts which its branches supply would perish, were it not for their commu- nication with the minute branches of other adjacent trunks. It is probable that one of the advantages derived from important or- gans being supplied from plexuses of nerves is, as has been suggested by Soemmerring, that such essential organs should never want that animation and influence which they derive from the nerves, even should casual obstruction take place in some of the trunks leading to such a plexus. But parts less essential to life equally require that such interruption of the nervous energy should be guarded against. Have we not a plexus formed in the axilla, prior to the distribution of nerves, to the upper extremities? Do not the sacral nerves form a plexus, in order to form the ischiadic or posterior crural nerve ? and

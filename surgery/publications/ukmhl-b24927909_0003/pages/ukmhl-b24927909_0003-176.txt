ON THE OCCASIONAL, &C. 166 as low as the fascia of the fore-arm ; for all the filaments of the cutaneous nerves lie above this fascia. The vein which had been opened, and some filaments of the cutaneous nerves, are all the parts of consequence which will be divided in this operation. The proximity of the division of the nerve to the vein must be regulated by the sup- posed extent of the disease. However, as the extent of the inflammation of the nerve is uncertain, I submit it to the consideration of surgeons whether it may not be advisable, in some cases, to divide either of the cuta- neous nerves, still more remotely from the injured nerve. I find little difficulty in detecting the trunk of these nerves in the dead subject; and I should suppose but little would occur in the living state ; for the compression of the torniquet would prevent any obscurity which haemorrhage might cause.

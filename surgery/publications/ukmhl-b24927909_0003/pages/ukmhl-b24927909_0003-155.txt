CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. 147 the general tumour, the originally diseased glands again become distinguishable. I now wish to show that their inflamma- tion, in consequence of local injury, is de- ducible from two causes: one, the absorption of acrid matter ; and the other, the effect ol irritation of the divided tube. Of the in- flammation arising from the absorption of morbific matter, every one is apprized; but that which is the effect of irritation has been less remarked. When virulent matter is taken up by the absorbents, it is generally conveyed to the next absorbent gland; where, its progress being retarded, its stimulating properties in- duce inflammation ; and frequently no evi- dent disease of the vessel through which it has passed can be distinguished. The ab- sorption of syphilitic and cancerous matter affords frequent proofs of this assertion. There are, indeed, some poisons so acrid, that the vessel which admits them inflames throughout its whole extent; yet still the glands are principally affected. When in- l 2 flam-

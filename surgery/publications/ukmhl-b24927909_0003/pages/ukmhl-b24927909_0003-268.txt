In the case just related, the quantity must have been sufficient to have occasioned the death of a considerable quantity of cellular substance. When the urine is diffused, and injected into the cellular substance extensively, scarifi- cations afford but an ineffectual outlet to it. The practice most appropriate to these cases would be, at as early a period as possible, to make a wound down to the aperture in the urethra, so that whatever urine may escape from the canal should run freely out of the wound, and be no longer forced to pervade the cellular substance. Yet it is difficult, nay, perhaps, in some cases impossible, to know where the urethra has given way; and one object which I had in view in relating these cases was, to induce others to reflect, and to endeavour to ascertain, by experience, how and where we ought, in different cases, to make such wounds as will afford free dis- charge to the urine, and prevent the horrible effects

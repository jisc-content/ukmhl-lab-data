39 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. perforation nearer to the trunk of the prin- cipal artery of the dura mater, from which I concluded that this haemorrhage had taken place. Having gently removed some of the coagulum, and introduced my finger into the aperture which had been made, I passed it as far as the second joint, before I could touch the dura mater. Fluid arterial blood now gushed out in such quantities as to keep the bone covered on which I was next to tre- phine. I ran no risk, however, in per- forming the operation ; for the dura mater was depressed so much that it could not be injured. But to guard against even the pos- sibility of such an accident, I introduced my finger between the dura mater and skull, and then perforated the bone with the trephine. Having thus removed a third piece, which was directly over the principal artery, 1 took out about four ounces of coagulated blood; upon which the dura mater quickly rose to ' its original level, and the Hcemorrhage from the wounded artery ceased. I now entirely removed the depressed portion of bone, and thus uncovered all the dura mater wliich had been detached ; so that I could distinctly feel u 4 its

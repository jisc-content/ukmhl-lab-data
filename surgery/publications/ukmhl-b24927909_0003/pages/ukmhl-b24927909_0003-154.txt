146 ON THE OCCASIONAL ILL duces a painful tumefaction of the absorbent glands ; and in some fevers these parts are particularly obnoxious to disease. There is another circumstance which de- serves attention; when the absorbents be- come inflamed, they quickly communicate this disease to the cellular substance by which they are surrounded. Most surgeons have remarked these vessels, when indurated, to appear like small chords, perhaps of one- eighth of an inch in diameter: this substance is surely not the slender sides of the vessel thus suddenly augmented in bulk, but an induration of the surrounding cellular sub- stance, to which the irritated vessel has com- municated inflammation. The formation of a common bubo is another instance of the power which these vessels possess of in- volving the surrounding parts in their dis- ease ; at first one or two glands are found to be inflamed, but they soon become undis- tinguishable in the general inflammation of the surrounding substance. This inflam- mation either is dispersed, or it terminates in suppuration ; and on the subsidence of the

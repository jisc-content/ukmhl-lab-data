150 ON THE OCCASIONAL ILL mation of that vessel will probably follow ; which will vary in its degree, in its extent, and in the course which it pursues. One degree of inflammation may occasion only a slight thickening of the venous tube, and an adhesion of its sides; more violent inflam- mation may be attended with the formation of more limited, or moreextensive abscesses; the matter of which may sometimes mix it- self with the circulating fluids, and produce dangerous consequences : or it may be cir- cumscribed by the thickening and adhesion of the surrounding parts, and then, like a common abscess, make its way to the surface. When the inflammation of the venous tube is extensive, it is, indeed, very probable that much sympathetic fever will ensue; not merely from the excitement which inflam- mation usually produces, but also because irritation will be continued along the mem- branous lining of the vein to the heart. If, however, the effect of the excited inflam- mation has luckily been to produce adhesion of the sides of the vein, at some little distance from the wounded part, the inflammation will here cease; its further transmission will, by

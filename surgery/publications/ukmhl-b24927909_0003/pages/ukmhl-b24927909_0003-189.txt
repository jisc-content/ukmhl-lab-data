ON EMPHYSEMA. 179 ribs unaccompanied with wounds of the lungs, that I cannot suppose patients were in these cases reduced to the necessity of . breathing with one lung only. These pa- tients, indeed, were all treated in the man- ner recommended and practised by Sir Wil- liam Blizard. Observing the great pain and irritation which the constant motion of the fractured ribs occasioned, he was induced to disregard the emphysema, and to confine the motion of the ribs by a tight bandage, in the same manner as when the lungs are un- injured: afterwards the patients were largely bled, and other evacuations werefreely made. This practice he has since continued with general success. The pressure of the ban- dage in general prevents the air from escap- ing out of the wounded lung, and pervading the cellular substance. It will, perhaps, ap- pear probable to many surgeons, that, for this very reason, the air will be likely to in- sinuate itself between the two pleurae, and thus occasion a collapse of the lung. I do not, however, see any good reason for such a supposition. The two pleurae remain in their natural state of contact; and there is no n 2 space

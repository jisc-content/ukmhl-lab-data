34 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. them the pressure on the brain would of itself be productive of fatal consequences. The arguments which 1 have stated against the immediate performance of the operation, apply, therefore, in my opinion, only to dubious cases ; to those in which, perchance, upon the subsidence of the inflammatory symptoms, the pressure may be found not to be so great, but that it may be borne with- out detriment, though there is a risk that it may be detrimental. Under these circumstances, by postpon- ing the operation, we avoid the aggravation of the inflammatory symptoms which im- mediately succeed to the injury, and those consequences which arise from leaving an aperture in the cranium, into which the con- tained parts are likely to be protruded. I say, by postponing the operation, because, if upon the subsidence of the inflammatory symptoms, the pressure by itself is found to produce prejudicial effects, we are still at liberty to perform it, nor is it likely to be attended with that violent inflammation which arises from the injury and operation conjointly.

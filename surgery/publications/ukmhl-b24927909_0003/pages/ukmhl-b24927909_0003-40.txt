ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 32 operation of trephining, in cases where its necessity is dubious, that it deprives the brain and its membranes of that natural sup- port which they receive from the bone. Un- der these circumstances, when inflammation comes on, the volume of the parts contained in the cranium will be so considerably aug- mented by the preternatural distention of their vessels, and subsequent effusion offluids, as to be protruded up into one aperture. The dura mater is likely to give way, and the pia mater, becoming exposed, will be more subject to inflammation. It now sustains the pressure which was formerly supported by the dura mater, and in its turn ulcerates, and the brain will protrude and produce fungous excrescences. These circumstances are more particularly likely to happen in children ; in them, indeed, the dura mater is so firmly connected with the bone, that it is rarely separated by accidental violence, and it is even difficult to tear off the bone, when it has been perforated by the trephine. The argument against immediately trephining the cranium, unless urged to it by great necessity, applies, therefore, more strongly to

The periosteum was in several places stript off from the skull, the scalp much bruised, and the posterior and inferior angle of the left parietal bone was beaten in. The visi- ble part of the depressed portion was an inch in length, and more than an eighth of an inch below the level of the cranium ; but the fracture extended along the squamous part of the temporal bone towards the basis of the skull: it could not, however, be traced, as the temporal muscle had not been removed from that part by the injury. â€” The scalp, being cleansed, was replaced, retained in its situation by slips of sticking-plaster, and a slight pressure by bandage was applied. The boy was perfectly sensible, his pulse regular, and not quickened. He had bled consider- ably from the temporal artery, which had been divided by the accident: eight ounces of blood were, however, taken from his arm; and some purging medicine was administered next morning, which procured three or four stools.

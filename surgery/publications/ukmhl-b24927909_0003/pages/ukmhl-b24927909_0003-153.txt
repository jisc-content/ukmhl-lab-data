CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. 145 It might be suspected, that in the cases which have been related, the lancet which was employed was envenomed; and that the absorption of virulent matter was the exciting cause of inflammation : the descent of the disease to the inferior absorbents, in the two first cases, opposes that opinion; and it is further invalidated by the observations which I shall proceed to offer. Since the structure and functions of the absorbing ves- sels have become so well known, the attention of medical practitioners has been directed to their diseases, and much novel inform- ation has been acquired. That which relates to the present subject I shall endeavour briefly to state. Physiology shews to us that the absorbents possess much sensibility. Practical observation strengthens this opi- nion : the celerity with which these vessels inflame, when they have imbibed noxious matter, and the pain which is suffered in consequence, sufficiently prove this circum- stance. Their frequent inflammation, in consequence of disturbance of the general constitution, may be however regarded as an additional argument. A common cold pro- vol. iii. l duces

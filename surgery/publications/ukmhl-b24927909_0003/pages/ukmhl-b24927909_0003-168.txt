I shall arrange what I have to say on this subject in the following manner : First, I shall explain what nerves are subject to in- jury ; secondly, I shall investigate what are the effects likely to be produced by such an accident; and, thirdly, I shall enquire what means are most likely to afford relief. First, the two cutaneous nerves are those which are exposed to injury. I dissected them in several subjects with attention, and found some irregularity in their distribution ; most frequently all their branches pass beneath the veins, at the bend of the arm ; but some- times, although the principal rami still go beneath these vessels, many small filaments are detached before them, which it is impos- sible to avoid wounding in phlebotomy.

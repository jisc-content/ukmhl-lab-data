In Mr. Lattaâ€™s Surgery, also, a similar case (as shown on dissection), is related, in which an uncommon slowness of the pulse, and coma without stertor, were the symp- toms produced. These cases show that a fracture of the skull is not likely to be followed by an equal degree of extravasation in every part, as the vessels connecting the dura mater to the cra- nium are, in most parts of that membrane, of a small size. If these are accidentally ruptur- ed, a slight haemorrhage ensues, which soon stops, and only a thin stratum of coagulated blood is found when the bone is removed.

In the three cases that I have related, the operation was done very shortly after the accident; in the first case, the brain was so compressed that it did not regain

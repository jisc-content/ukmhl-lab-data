63 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. The quantity of blood effused will depend on the magnitude of the vessels, or on their disposition to bleed. As the disease is gene- rally situated not far beneath the surface of the brain, there is less risk of its proceed- ing from the former cause. If it arises from the latter, it is very likely that the distention caused by the confinement of the effused blood would irritate the vessels, and keep up their disposition to haemorrhage ; therefore the treatment already recommended is likely to diminish it. But should the quantity of the haemorrhage seem to threaten the life of the patient, I should think it most proper to take away the coagulum, and to expose the cavity in the brain, in order to learn whether suffering some sudden loss of blood to take place, together with the exposure of the bleeding vessels, might not produce a bene- ficial change, and a cessation of the haemor- rhage. I am induced to propose this mode of conduct, from reasoning founded on analogy: for in other parts of the body a haemorrhage will sometimes continue, not- withstanding a considerable pressure made by a large quantity of coagulum, together with

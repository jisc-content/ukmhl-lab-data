But if the tumour continues to increase, and if the patient suffers a train of bad symp- toms, apparently arising from irritation and pressure made on the brain, some further attempt to relieve him seems to be required. Under these circumstances, we have reason to suspect that the coagulum, from want of room to protrude, is enlarged internally; or that by plugging up the orifice in the bone, it prevents the escape of some fluid collected within the cranium.* The obvious mode of * Mr. Hill, in relating a case of this kind, says, that he “ was obliged to shave away the tumour, and push a lan- cet into its root as often as the stupor and other symp- toms showed that matter was lodged there, by which the patient was uniformly relieved, and afterwards reco- vered.”—(See his Cases in Surgery, p. 91, 92.)

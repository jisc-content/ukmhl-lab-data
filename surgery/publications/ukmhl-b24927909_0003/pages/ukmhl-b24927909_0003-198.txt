ON EMPHYSEMA. 188 The great advantage of retaining the lung in a collapsed state is, if possible, more strik- ingly shown when those bodies have suffered a greater degree of injury than can occur to them from the fracture of a rib. I have seen cases in which bullets have passed through the lungs, near the root of those bodies, and where many of the large vessels were conse- quently torn, in which the blood has been poured into the cavity of the chest, has con- densed the lung by its pressure, and thus suppressed the haemorrhage. The injured Vessels might, under these circumstances, Unite; and the blood being let out of the thorax, the lung might gradually be re- stored to its former function. Yet in the cases which I was a witness to, the patients died of inflammation and fever ; but the particular nature of the circumstances was unknown during the life of the patient; and of course the conduct appropriated to them was not pursued. The fluid contained in the cavity of the thorax had in these cases undergone a degree of putrefaction previous to the patientâ€™s death j which state required its discharge. But

ON THE OCCASIONAL ILL 162 branches of the external cutaneous nerve may be wounded. Secondly, I wish to enquire what are the ills likely to arise from a wounded nerve.â€” Whoever reflects on the wonderful minute- ness of the nervous fibrils, and considers their perfect distinctness from each other, although connected by a common covering of cellular substance, will scarcely imagine a partial division of a nervous fibril. If I sought to express myself strictlyon this sub- ject, I should speak of a partial division of a packet of nerves. But I shall use the com- monly adopted language, and call those chords nerves, which are really composed of multitudes of separate nerves.

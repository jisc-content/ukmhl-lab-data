ON EMPHYSEMA. 173 pleura. At the time this was effected, I be- lieve the patient was in the act of expir- ation ; for a blast of air evidently issued from the thorax ; and afterwards, whilst the integuments were kept retracted, and the aperture in the pleura consequently un- covered, the external air continued to rush in during the enlargement of the thorax, and to be forced out again during its con- traction. But when the divided skin was allowed to descend to its natural situation, and thus the opening of the pleura was covered, no farther passage of air took place, and all that could then be perceived was a depression of the integuments opposite to the aperture in the thorax, occasioned by the pressure of the atmosphere, during the en- largement of that cavity. I had got ready a large injecting syringe, and, introducing the pipe into the cavity of the chest, I drew up the piston, and thus exhausted the air, till I found I was stopped from proceeding by the lung, which had risen up and applied itself to the mouth of the syringe. The skin was then immediately brought down over the aper- ture in the thorax, and served, like a valve, to

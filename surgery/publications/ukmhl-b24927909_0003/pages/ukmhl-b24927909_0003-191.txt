181 ON EMPHYSEMA. frequently the lungs do not collapse when the cavity of the chest is exposed in the liv- ing animal*; and I have also had occasion to observe, on dividing the pleura costalis in a case of supposed hydrothorax (in which, however, no water was found), that the ex- posed lung did not collapse; a circumstance which, I think, ought to encourage us to a more frequent performance of such an oper- ation. In other experiments, however, the lungs have been known to collapse; and the circumstances on which either of these effects depends are not perhaps well understood. For these reasons, I believe that in most cases of emphysema succeeding to broken ribs, pressure by bandage not only hinders the air from diffusing itself through the cel- lular substance, but serves to prevent it from escaping out of the wounded lung, and of course facilitates the healing of the wound, which would be prevented by the constant transmission of air. Its early application, therefore, will often prevent a very trouble- * Memoirs of the Medical Society of London, vol. iv. p. 4-tO. N 3 some

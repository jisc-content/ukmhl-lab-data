226 ON THE REMOVAL OF of the capsule of the joint; for when the inte- gumentswere suffered to regain their natural position, the wound in them was nearer to the patella than the wound which was made in the capsule. The fascia which covers the joint being exposed by the division of the integuments, it was divided in a similar direction, and nearly to the same extent. The capsule was now laid bare, and I gently divided it to the extent of half an inch, where it covered one of the hard substances, which suddenly slipped through the open- ing, and, by pressing gently upon the other, it also came through at the same part. The bodies, which werethus removed, were about three quarters of an inch in length, and half an inch in breadth. They had a highly-po- lished surface, and were hard like cartilage. The fluid contained in the joint was pressed towards the wound, and about two ounces of synovia were discharged. I then drew the wound of the integument gently towards the patella, pressed the two sides together, and closed it accurately with sticking-plaster, enjoining the patient to keep the limb as free from motion as possible. . > No

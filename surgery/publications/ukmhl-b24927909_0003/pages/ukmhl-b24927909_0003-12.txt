4 ON INJURIES . OF THE HEAD. ceive so many circumstances which require investigation, that I entertain no hope of ever being able to obtain, from my own expe- rience, all the information which is wanted. I hope, however, that the hints offered in this Essay may have the effect of inducing surgeons to pay a closer attention to cases of this kind, and that thus, by their united observations, the public may at length be- come possessed of that knowledge which the labours of an individual could never supply. In the accounts which we have of the for- mer practice in France, it is related, that surgeons made numerous perforations along the whole track of a fracture of the cranium ; and, as far as I am able to judge, without any very clear design. Mr. Pott also advises such an operation, even with a view to pre- vent the inflammation and suppuration of the dura mater, which he so much appre- hended. But many cases have occurred of late, where,even in fractures with depression, the patients have done well without an oper- -J ation.

ON EMPHYSEMA. 180 space for the air to pass between them. So frequently also are there adhesions between the surface of the lung and the sides of the thorax, that I think in some of the cases of emphysema which I have seen, this circum- stance must have occurred, and that if the lungs had receded from the sides of the tho- rax, the symptoms would have indicated the laceration or stretching of these adhesions. An idea has generally prevailed among surgeons, that if the pleura costalis were divided in the living subject, the lung would immediately collapse, as it is usually found to do in the dead one. But M. Bremond* has shown by experiments, that not only when an opening is made into the cavity of the thorax, but even when some of the ribs are removed, the lungs still occupy their natu- ral situation, and are even thrust up into the opening during expiration.

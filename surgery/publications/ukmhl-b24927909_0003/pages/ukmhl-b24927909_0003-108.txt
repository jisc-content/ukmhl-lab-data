In blisters, ought to be employed at the very commencement; for, if omitted, the dis- ease will then become established, and the powers of the body will soon be too much sunk to admit of the same active treatment at a later period. I have here represented the general effects of inflammation of the pia mater when it arises from external violence. In other cases, indeed, where it comes on, as it were, spontaneously, or without any powerfully exciting cause, (in which case it generally falls under the care of the physician,) it has appeared to have affected the brain but little, and to have been very slow in its progress, and inactive in its nature. In such cases it has produced a deposition between the tu- nica arachnoidea and the pia mater, or a collection of serum between the former membrane and the dura mater. Under these circumstances, I have learned that the . rationality of the patient has been scarcely deranged. And as such a state of disease may occur after an accident, I have thought it right to mention it in this place.

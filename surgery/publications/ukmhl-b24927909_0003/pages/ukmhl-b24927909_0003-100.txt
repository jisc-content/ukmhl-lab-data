92 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. ever, examined other cases of fatal concus- sions, without observing any such lesion of the substance of the brain. It has hitherto been considered as a desir- able object, to point out any marks by which we might distinguish between compression and concussion of the brain ; but I believe no such criteria have yet been communi- cated to the public. If we judge of the symptoms of compression from what occurs in cases of apoplexy, or from cases like those which have been related of the rup- ture of the middle artery of the dura mater, (in one of which cases it was evident, that concussions had no share in producing the symptoms,) we must, I think, be of opinion, that pressure on the brain occasions in- sensibility, partially, or generally, and in a degree proportionate to its quantity. In ex- treme cases, such as I have cited, the insen- sibility is manifested by every circumstance. The pupil of the eye is dilated, and cannot be made to contract even by a strong light. The respiration is slow and stertorous, and the pulse proportionately slow and labour- ing.

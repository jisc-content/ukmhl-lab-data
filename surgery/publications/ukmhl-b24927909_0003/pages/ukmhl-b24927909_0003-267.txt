ON FISTULA IN THE PERINEUM. 257 I was desired to see the patient. The swelling then was as large as an orange, but oblong, extending from the groin down the front of the scrotum. The colour and induration of the skin, in such cases, are in general so pe- culiar, as at once to impress the opinion that effused urine has been the cause of the in- flammation and abscess. 1, without hesita- tion, cut through the thickened integuments, and discharged about six ounces of putrid pus and urine. A quantity of sloughy cellular substance soon afterwards protruded through the wound, which gradually separated and came away. The patientâ€™s intellects soon became clear, all fever left him, and he soon regained his usual state of health. In this case I conclude that the urethra had given way on its left side, in front of the fascia, which covers and binds down the parts be- neath the skin of the perinaeum, and in the vicinity of the abscess. I mention this opin- ion to lead us to form a probable conjec- ture as to the cause of the urine becoming diffused, in some cases, beneath the integu- ments of the pubes and abdomen. vol. hi. s When

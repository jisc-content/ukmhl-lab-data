242 ON H/TMORRHOIDAL DISEASES. description. A person having some disorder of* the bowels, and having an urgent call to void the fasces, has suffered afterwards great u pain for a number of hours. The next evacuation has been attended with similar consequences; and thus the patients have continued for a considerable time, ignorant of the cause of their sufferings. On intro- ducing the finger, I have distinctly felt, and fairly replaced a fold of the bowel, and the patient has been immediately relieved from all uneasiness ; and, by repeating the same act when required, and keeping the bowels regular by a mixture of castor oil and mu- cilage with cinnamon water, they have suf- fered no uneasiness subsequent to the alvine discharges, and in a short time this faulty action of the bowel has entirely ceased. But if a patient remains ignorant of the cause of his sufferings, and does not adopt this mode of relieving them, the fold of the bowel becomes irritated and thickened by the pressure of the sphincter muscle; it en- larges and becomes in form adapted to this unnatural situation, and thus we often meet with folds of the bowel form ing hmmorrhoidal 1 * tumours.

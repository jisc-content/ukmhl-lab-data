SUBSTANCES FltOM THE KNEE. 229 patient might be said to be well. He has, since the operation, walked as much as he was accustomed to do, and has not found the least inconvenience. 1 have, since the publication of the pre- ceding case, seen one of the same kind, so curious on account of the number of loose bodies contained in the capsule of the knee- joint, that it seems do deserve being men- tioned. I do not exaggerate when I say> they must much exceed a hundred in num- ber, and feel like shot of various sizes, dis- tending the capsule on either side of the patella. There is no fluid in the joint, nor do they prevent the patient from taking ordinary exercise.

But the com- pression of the ligature did not seem to make the least difference in the general state of the patient, whilst it completely prevented the further effusion of blood. With a knife and dissecting forceps I then exposed the lacerated vessels, and found that the primary branches of the external carotid artery had been torn off from the trunk. By drawing upwards the ligature which encircled the trunk of the artery, I made the internal carotid tense, so that its course and ruptured state could be distinctly felt. The ligature on the trunk was slackened, and the gush of blood further confirmed the laceration of the internal carotid artery.

ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 49 Where the extravasation on the dura mater is but small, it will probably not re- quire any operation. A slight haemorrhage from the bone, which may happen from the anastomosing of the vessels within its sub- stance, will not, in this case, lead to any injurious error. But from what I have observed, I am inclined to believe, that even a small effusion of blood will diminish the haemorrhage from the superincumbent bone. Mr. Pott had an idea, that the bone would perish when the dura mater was detached for a considerable space from its inside ; and some cases which he has related seem to favour this opinion : but many other cases to be met with in authors, and many which have occurred to my ob- servation, prove that the opinion was not well founded. Indeed we cannot suppose that the bone would perish from this cause ; for it still receives blood, not only from the anastomosing of vessels within its substance, but also from the pericranium externally; and the success which has of late attended vol. hi. e the

14 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. charged from the hospital there was not the most trivial circumstance which couldinduce us to suspect that the brain had sustained any injury from the accident. His sleep was sound and undisturbed, and the sudden mo- tion of his head in any direction occasioned no giddiness or inconvenience. It appearsvery clearly, I think, from these cases, as well as from a great number of others to be found in books, that a slight degree of pressure does not derange the functions of the brain, for a limited time after its application. That it does not do so at first is very obvious; as persons areoften perfectly sensible, andfree from head-ache and giddiness immediately after the injury. Whether it may not pro- duce such an effect at some remote period, is not so easily determined, since this cannot be ascertained but. by a continued acquaintance with the persons who had received the in- juries. All, however, whom I have had an opportunity of knowing for any length of time after the accident, continued as well as if nothing of the kind had ever happened to 15 them.

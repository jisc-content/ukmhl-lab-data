It is of great importance to distinguish accurately the nature of such cases ; and the distinction is not difficult when there is an interval of sense between the blow and the stupor occasioned by the effused blood. In the first related case, for instance, the nature of the accident was made sufficiently evident by this circumstance. But though we are assured that the patient labours under the effects of compression, we cannot, in many instances, know the situation of the com- pressing cause. In other cases, again, where there is no interval of sense after the accident, we are at a loss to determine whether the senseless

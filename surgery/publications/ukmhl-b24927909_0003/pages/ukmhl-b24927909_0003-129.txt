121 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. ger, even without an accurate dissection of the part. If the incision be made on that side of the artery which is next the trachea, where no important parts can be injured, as was done in the present instance, the finger can then be passed behind the artery, so as to compress it. The vessel being sufficiently bulky and firm, to make its form and outline distinctly perceptible, a needle may then be passed behind the artery, as near as possible to that edge of it which is next to the in- ternal jugular vein: there can be little risk of wounding that vessel, or of including in the ligature the 8th pair of nerves which lies between them. In attempting to secure the carotid artery, I passed behind it, in the man- ner described, a blunt hook with an eye in the point, and having previously introduced a ligature into it, I drew back theinstrument, and thus enclosed the artery. When I compressed the vessel by tighten- ing the knot of the ligature, I did it slowly, and with a watchful attention to the suffer- ings of the patient; for I cannot but suppose that had the nerve of the 8th pair been in- cluded.

As almost all the circulating blood must, in such cases, be transmitted through the vessels of one lung, if the quantity of that fluid be not greatly diminished, the pul- monary vessels will become turgid; a larger effusion of fluids will therefore take place into the air-cells and cavity of the chest, and thus the function of the acting lung will be materially impaired. This reasoning illustrates what experience has already de- i termined, viz. that the preservation of life in these cases depends on the most copious blood-letting. r * . The case which I have related clearly shows that the collapsed state of the lung affords an opportunity for the wound of its surface to heal; and when this desirable event is accomplished, the air which is at that

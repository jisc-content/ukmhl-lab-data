Every surgeon must ac- knowledge that it would be a very desirable thing to ascertain when blood is effused be- tween the dura mater and the skull; for if the extravasation has happened in the more interior parts, a surgical operation is not likely to afford relief.* Now, if the extrava- sation which compresses the brain be situa- ted immediately beneath the bone, I think there are signs by which it will be disclosed; and as sufficient notice has not been taken of these, I wish particularly to call the attention of surgeons to them. * In those cases which I have seen, where blood was extravasated between the dura and pia mater, and a divi- sion of the former membrane was made for its discharge, in some instances the serous part of it only could be eva- cuated ; for the coagulum was spread over the hemi- sphere of the brain, and had descended as low as pos- sible towards its inferior part; in others, though a portion of the effused blood was discharged in a fluid or grumous state, a considerable quantity which was coagu- lated remained behind, so that very little relief was obtained by the operation.

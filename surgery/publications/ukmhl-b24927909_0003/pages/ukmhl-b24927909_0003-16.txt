ON INJURIES OF THE IIEA1). 8 CASE CASE III. A man, between thirty and forty years of age, received a blow on the forehead from a brick thrown at him, by which the frontal bone was fractured about half an inch above the orbit: the fracture measured two inches in length, and the upper portion of the bone was depressed about the eighth of an inch. He was not even stunned by the blow, and walked to the hospital without assistance, complaining only of soreness in the wounded integuments. Sixteen ounces of blood were immediately taken from his arm ; he was confined (much against his inclination) to a scanty and liquid diet, and was purged every second day. â€” This pa- tient did not experience any illness; and the wound soon healed. CASE IV. A boy, about thirteen years old, had a fracture, with depression, of part of the tem- poral and parietal bones. By similar treat- ment, he also escaped without any material ill consequences ; but in this case part of the injured bone exfoliated.

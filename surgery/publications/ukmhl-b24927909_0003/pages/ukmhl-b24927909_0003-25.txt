17 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. early period. Another surgeon, prejudiced against the use of the trephine might, with equal injustice, consider the mischief, which ensues in certain cases, as entirely owing to the operation. The degree of pressure which thebrain can sustain without great injury to the system, may probably vary according to the disposi- tion of that organ to be afFectedby it, the sud- denness of its application, and the direction in which it is made; and although it must be very difficult to obtain any precise know- ledge on this subject, yet there is great reason to believe that the brain can bear more pres- sure without injury to it than was formerly supposed. The first of these circumstances seems evident; for in some persons a slight pressure produces severe symptoms; whilst, in others, a much greater degree is borne without inconvenience. We can rarely judge of the effects of pressure when any part of the cranium is beaten in by a blow; for in that case the shock generally occasions stupefac- tion. Internal haemorrhages, perhaps, afford us the best criterion whereby to determine vol. hi. c the

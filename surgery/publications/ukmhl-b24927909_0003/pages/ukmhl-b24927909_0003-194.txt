ON EMPHYSEMA. 184 is not probable that they will make ; the in- active diaphragm will not be thrust up into the hypochondrium as in natural expiration, and the ribs will remain nearly stationary ; but in proportion to the degree of the ex- piratory effort that is made, the air may be condensed, and the mediastinum thrust to the opposite side of the chest. But no injury will arise from this pressure, neither can it happen in any great degree ; for both sides of the chest being diminished at the same time, a slight compression of the opposite lung cannot be detrimental, since it helps to express the air from it, â€” the very effect which is now required ; and as that lung is pressed inwards by the sides of the thorax, it will counteract any great pressure made on the mediastinum. Upon inspiration taking place, the condensed air will expand and fill the enlarged cavity, and the mediasti- num will regain its natural situation ; so that the function of the sound lung is scarcely, if at all, impeded by the compression which takes place on the opposite side oi the chest.

164 ON THE OCCASION AT, ILL the surrounding parts also appeared. These observations make it evident to me that the disease consists in inflammation of the in- jured nerve, in common with the other wounded parts; and this inflammation I can conceive to happen with or without a total division of the nervous chord. I should consider a case of inflamed nerve as an ob- ject of great curiosity : every one, I think, will admit, that it is likely to communicate dreadful irritation to the sensorium; and every one will perceive that a cure will pro- bably arise from intercepting its commu- nication with that important part. Thirdly, I proceed to enquire what is the most probable methodof relievingthe effects arising from an inflamed nerve. The general opinion is, that the nerve is only partially divided, and that a total division would free the patient from a continuance of his suffer- ings. Mr. Pott supposed that the wounded nerve was situated at one or the other extre- mity of the wound which had been made in the vein ; he therefore proposed to divide it totally, by enlarging a little the original orifice.

CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. 163 out the body. In the many operations per- formed, and in the wounds daily occurring, I think it would be strange if a partial divi- sion of a nerve should not happen ; yet no peculiar symptoms are observed usually to ensue.

If the reader refers to the plate, he will perceive that, in some cases, it is impossible to avoid dividing branches of nerves in phlebotomy, as some- times they pass before the vein. These branches are so exposed, that I should be surprised if they did not many times suffer a partial division. Surely, however, a half- divided nerve would unite without causing a general derangement of the nervous sys- tem.

In the cases related by Mr. Pott and Dr. Monro, I believe that some days elapsed after the infliction of the injury, before any alarming derangement of the nervous system ensued.

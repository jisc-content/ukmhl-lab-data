It deserves to be mentioned, too, that one of the patients was a sailor, and therefore, probably, led a life of irregularity as well as of exertion. The result of cases of this kind, which I have met with in au- thors, does not lead to the apprehension of any future mischief; nor is it easy to con- ceive that the pressure, which caused no ill effects at a time when the contents of the cranium filled its cavity completely, should afterwards prove injurious when they have adapted themselves to its altered size and shape.

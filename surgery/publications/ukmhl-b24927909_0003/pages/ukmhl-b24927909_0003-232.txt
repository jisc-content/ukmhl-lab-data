222 ON THE REMOVAL OF inner side of the joint; and it required only to put that part in a depending position, and those bodies descended by their gravity through the fluid, and were easily fixed in the situation to which they had fallen. I could bring them on the inner surface of the internal condyle of the os femoris, which is of considerable extent; and, by placing the points of my finger, so as to describe a por- tion of a circle, I could prevent them from passing again into the cavity of the joint, al- though the limb might be moved, and the patient press firmly against them with his finger, as if he meant to push them into the joint. Yet when my fingers, which thus confined them, were removed, the slightest touch caused them to disappear, and to glide with velocity into the general cavity of the joint. This is the situation, and the manner in which I think these bodies can be most con- veniently and certainly fixed. The inner surface of the internal condyle of the os fe- moris presents an extensive and nearly plain surface, which terminates in front and at its upper o

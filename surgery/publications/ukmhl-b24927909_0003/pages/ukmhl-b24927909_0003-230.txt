ON THE REMOVAL OP 220 they slip under the ligament of the patella, and become interposed between the condyles of the os femoris and the tibia, they impede progression, and cause pain, and so much injury as to bring on inflammation in the joint. If the extensor tendons, the patella and its ligament, can, by Mr. Heyâ€™s ban- dage, be kept steadily pressed against the corresponding parts of the joint, then these bodies must remain stationary on one or other side of the patella, and the patient will be exempted from the inconvenience and injury which their motion in the joint occa- sions. Under these circumstances the neces- sity for an operation is obviated ; but in the case which I am about to relate the bandage was of no avail, for reasons which will ap- pear in the relation. It is not improbable, also, that though these bodies may occasion much irritation at first, yet that the joint becoming accustomed to their stimulus may afterwards be less affected by their presence, which circumstance ought to be adverted to and ascertained, before an operation be undertaken.

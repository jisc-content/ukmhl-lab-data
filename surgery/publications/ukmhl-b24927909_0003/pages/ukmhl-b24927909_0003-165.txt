CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. 157 The the less regret my deficiency of experience on this subject, as I can refer the reader to the second volume of the Medical Commu- nications : he will there meet with two cases which, I believe, he will acknowledge to be inflammations of the fascia, attended, how- ever, with some peculiarity of symptoms. The first case is related by Mr. Colby of Dorrington, in Devonshire; the other by Mr. Watson. The inflammation of the fascia, in the latter case, was followed by a permanent contraction of the fore-arm. From this case I think we have acquired use- ful knowledge : should a similar contraction of the fore-arm from a tense state of the fascia in future occur, it seems reasonable to suppose that it may be completely relieved by detaching the fascia from the tendon of the biceps, to which it is naturally connected. This, I conclude, was the cause of the per- fect restoration of free motion in the case first related by Mr. Watson. On this sub- ject I will not enlarge, but submit the opi- nion to the judgment of the reader.

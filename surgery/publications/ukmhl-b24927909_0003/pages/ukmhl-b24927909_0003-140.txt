ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 132 lytic, yet, in my opinion, it approached to that state. It has been already observed, that a double construction might be put upon the symp- toms ; yet as the inflammation of the brain was equal on both sides, we might naturally expect the whole body to suffer equally Should the state of the right side have been, as appears most probable, an approach to a state of paralysis, it must surely be con- sidered as peculiarly curious. An effusion of blood in the left hemisphere of the brain would affect the opposite side of the body in the same manner that cutting off the supply of blood to the left side appears in this instance to have done. I forbear to speculate on this subject: the fact which I have mentioned seems to deserve notice, and though at present it must stand alone, it may receive future confirmation, and when thus supported, be applied to the elucidation of physiology. I have thought it right to record this case, not merely because it is curious, but because

CONSEQUENCES OF VENESECTION. 151 by the adhesion, be prevented. The effect of adhesion of membranes, in preventing the extension of inflammation along their sur- faces, is frequently apparent, and has been well explained by Mr. Hunter on another occasion. In one case, Mr. Hunter applied a compress on the inflamed vein, above the wounded part, and he thought that he suc- ceeded in producing adhesion, for the in- flammation extended no further. In those cases, where the inflammation does not con- tinueequally in both directions, but descends along the course of the vein, it is probable that its extension in the other direction is prevented by adhesion. I have thus briefly and imperfectly tran- scribed Mr. Hunterâ€™s opinion, that the pre- sent Essay might not be altogether deficient in information relative to this subject. I have seen but three cases where an inflam- mation of the vein succeeded to vensesection; they, however, confirm the foregoing observ- ations. The vein did not in either case evi- dently suppurate. In the first, about three inches ol the tube inflamed both above and l 4 below

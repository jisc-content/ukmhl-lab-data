CONSEQUENCES OF VEN/ESECTION. 165 orifice. It is, however, possible that the point of the lancet might injure a nerve lying beneath the vein. This will be easily understood by referring to the plate. Mr. Bell directs an extensive transverse in- cision to be made through the original wound ; but if the injured nerve be situated at the upper extremity of the orifice, it will remain unaffected by this operation. Mr. Bell also advises the incision to be con- tinued to the bone ; but this appears to me dangerous and unnecessary.

This intention can only be accomplished by making a transverse in- cision above the orifice in the vein. The incision need not be very extensive, for the injured nerve must lie within the limits of the original orifice, and it need only descend m 3 as

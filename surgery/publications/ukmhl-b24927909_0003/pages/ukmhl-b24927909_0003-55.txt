47 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. I have already said, that, unless one of the large arteries of the dura mater be wounded, the quantity of blood poured out will pro- bably be inconsiderable ; and the slight com- pression of the brain which this occasions may not be attended with any peculiar symp- toms ; or perhaps it may occasion some stupor, or excite an irritation disposing the subjacent parts to become inflamed: but both these effects will gradually abate, nor will any inflammation ensue, if proper means are taken to prevent it. It is indeed highly pro- bable, that, in many cases which have done well without an operation, such an extrava- sation has existed. But if there be so much blood on the dura mater as materially to de- range the functions of the brain, the bone, to a certain extent, will no longer receive blood from within j and by the operation performed for its exposure, the pericranium must have been separated from its outside. I believe that a bone so circumstanced will not be found to bleed ; and I am, at least, certain, it cannot with the same freedom and celerity as it does when the dura mater remains connected with it internallv.

67 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. F 2 SECTION IV. Concussion of the Brain. As I am of opinion that the effects of concussion have not been justly described by authors, and as the symptoms related by them are not, according to my experience, those which usually occur, I have therefore selected two cases out of a great number that I have seen, in order to show what have ap- never meant by the recital of these cases to deny that the surface of the brain, when exposed and irritated, would throw out a vascular fungus; it was only intended to describe a species of those appearances which had been denominated fungus or hernia cerebri. In all the cases of true fungus cerebri which I had seen when I first wrote the foregoing account, the fungus grewâ€™ so slowly that it could not be mistaken or confounded with the ap- pearances which took place in the cases I have cited. Since that period, I have seen cases in which the fungus grew much more rapidly, yet none in that degree which would make it liable to be confounded with the appear- ances described in the present section. The curative indications in the true fungus cerebri seem to be, to dimmish those causes which occasion the brain to be thrust upwards against the bone, and to apply gentle pressure from without, so as to give that degree of sup- port which the part ought naturally to receive from the dura mater and bone. peared

If the skin be divided, the swelling is found to be caused by effused blood; and if the clot be removed, there is no stream of blood emitted as from a vein. If the wound be small, blood again collects beneath the skin, and the swelling is repro- duced. If the bowels be regulated, so that the state of irritation, which is the cause of these productions, be mitigated or removed, and if the slightly painful and heated swell- ing be cooled by evaporating washes, the effused blood is frequently absorbed, and the distended skin appears loose and pendulous. On the contrary, if the irritation continues from there being some permanent disease on the inside of the bowel, then the effused blood becomes an organised substance, and a permanent external pile is formed. The orifice of the anus is often surrounded by tumours of this kind, which, however, do not

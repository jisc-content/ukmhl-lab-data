ON FISTUL.E IN THE PERINEUM. 953 The complicated sinuses, which form in some cases of fistulae in perinaeo, do not appear to me to arise from such simple cases, but from the urethra ulcerating in many parts. Anatomical examination has shown this to be fact in several cases which I have inspected. r * ' * * * r l r *% The ulceration, or giving way of the urethra, is, I think, generally understood to be the consequence of a stricture, affording so complete an obstacle to the passage of the urine, as to occasion the canal to inflame, ulcerate, or slough above the impediment. It is very evident that this is not unfre- quently the case; yet I do not believe that surgeons in general are sufficiently im- pressed with the knowledge of the follow- ing fact, that the urethra may ulcerate in various parts from irritation, even whilst there is a sufficient channel for the free exit of the urine. The following cases are re- lated in proof of this fact: CASE.

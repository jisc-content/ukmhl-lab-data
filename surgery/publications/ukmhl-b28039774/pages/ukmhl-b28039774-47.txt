OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 31 sence of many practitioners, I tied the carotid artery at its emergence from beneath the omo- hyoideus muscle, and above the tumor. As the patient’s neck was fat, the incision made in the integuments was not less than three inches in length; the rest of the operation was chiefly ac- complished by means of a silver knife, and not above a tablespoonful of blood was lost. The ligature, formed of a portion of silk-worm gut, as recommended by Mr. Fielding,* was readily con- veyed round the artery by Bremner’s needle, and after being tied, both ends were cut away. The external wound was secured by two stitches, and a strap of adhesive plaster. The patient felt no immediate effect from the operation, except a slight faintness; she walked up stairs unsupported, and sat some time in a chair, before she would get into bed. The effect on the pulse was very remarkable, that of the right wrist being full and strong, while that of the left was comparatively small and feeble. In the evening, the patient felt comfortable, complaining only of a dryness of the fauces, attri- buted to the opium she had taken. She was now ordered to have five grains of calomel.

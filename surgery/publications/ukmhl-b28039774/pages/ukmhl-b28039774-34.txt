TREATMENT OF 18 A. Burns. These cases seemed to me to be sufficient to prove the correctness of the principles of the ori- ginal projector of this operation; and it is only see Appendix, to be wondered at how surgeons should not have long ago adopted it; and though some subse- quent writers have advocated the propriety of the experiment, others attempted to throw it into ridicule. Brasdor’s “ I cannot conceive,” says Allan Burns, “ a more demned1 by°Mr^ futile idea than to suppose that such an opera- tion could possibly tend to prevent the growth of an aneurismal sac: one might readily believe that it may, by preventing the blood from passing freely through the tumor, cause it to enlarge more rapidly than before. That it would occa- sion a firm coagulum of the contents of the aneu- rism, and consequently enlargement of the ana- stomosing branches; a diversion of blood from the tumor is what one would hardly expect, and least of all would any one imagine, that Dessault would have been the projector of such a doctrine, and Deschamps the first to put it to the test of experiment. In doing this, the latter had no rea- son to boast of his dexterity, nor could he say more of his success. Indeed, all circumstances considered, there is no point in the treatment of aneurism, which should be more decidedly repro- SandMck, bated than this: it is absurd in theory, and ex- by AHan Bums.perjence proves that it is ruinous in practice.” Surgical ana-

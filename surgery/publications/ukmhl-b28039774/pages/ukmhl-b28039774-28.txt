TREATMENT OF Y2 It seems to be a law of nature, that whenever the circulation is directed into a new channel, the vessels in which the blood was originally carried, now being no longer of use, contract and become gradually obliterated. Of this, the obliteration of the ductus arteriosus and ductus venosus afford striking examples, as well as the changes in the umbilical artery and vein after birth. Whilst this process is going forward in the tumor, the limb continues to be nourished by the enlargement of the anastamosing vessels. The Anastamosing enlargement of these to a certain extent takes arttnes enlarge. p}ace aimost instantly after the trunk has been tied. I observed this in a child in whom I had secured the carotid artery. I could see the t branches of the temporal and occipital underneath the delicate integument enlarging, and thus ac- tively acquiring great additional vigour immedi- ately after the operation. Their number. However necessary it may be that the calibre and activity of a considerable number of the anastamosing vessels should at first be increased Sir A. Cooper’s Observation. Med. and Chl- rurg. Tr. vol. iv. page 25. in order to supply the limb with its due quantity of blood, dissections have proved, that ultimately the function of the vessel which had been tied was supplied by a very limited number of arteries, and those too nearly in the site of the original. Sir Astley Cooper amputated the thigh of a man on whom he had operated some years before for a popliteal aneurism, and he found an artery in the limb of equal magnitude, and apparently in the site of the femoral artery. “ Hypothesis,” says he, i

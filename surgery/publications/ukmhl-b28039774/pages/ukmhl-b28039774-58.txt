42 THIRD CASE OF CAROTID ANEURISM nution in the bulk of the aneurismal tumor was Reports. immediately apparent on the application of the ligature around the artery, and its pulsation was materially lessened. On the following day, I found that the patient had passed a comfortable night; the pulse at each wrist was moderate in quantity, but that of the right side was full and strong, as compared with the left. The heart’s impulse was very moderate; and the patient, of her own accord, noticed to me that which constitutes an essential feature in her case; namely, that “ the beating of the heart was gone.” She did not even experience the palpita- tion after, or at the time she was retching violently, although such an exertion, prior to the operation, would undoubtedly have excited violent action in the heart. The ligature, did not produce any apparent ill-effects on the brain—the cerebral functions not being, in any degree, disturbed. On the third day after the operation, I moved the dressings from the wound, and also took away the lower suture; the upper part of the wound had united by the adhesive process. The aneu- rismal tumor had so far subsided, that it was only evident to the eye, by a feeble pulsation at the part; and, on applying the finger, the tumor was felt to be much consolidated, and greatly reduced in size. The patient was, in every respect, doing well; and she remarked, that she now slept better than for two years past, not being disturbed by frightful dreams.

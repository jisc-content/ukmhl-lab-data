THE NEW OPERATION. 58 force, though it could not altogether obstruct the current of the blood in the sac. Rationale of It had often been conceived, that for the cure of Hunter s ope- lation. aneurism, according to the Hunterian principle of operating, it is requisite that the flow of blood through the aneurism should be entirely inter- rupted, in order to admit of the coagulation of the blood in the tumor. But as I have already See page 14. shown, the observations of Sir Everard Home, as well as those of subsequent writers, have proved that this doctrine is erroneous, and that it is suf- ficient for the cure of an aneurism that the im- petus of the blood through it be diminished, lami- nae of coagulable lymph being then formed within the parietes of the sac. Its practical Admitting this view of the subject to be correct, thPePaneurhmn0fand that both the process employed by nature, the ninonunata. an(j tj10 0peration on the Hunterian principle, do not necessarily require a complete stoppage of the circulation of the blood in the tumor, for the cure of the disease, it seemed to me a rational practical inference to deduce from these facts, that in cases of aneurism of the Arteria Innominata, the pro- gress of the disease might be arrested by tying its two great branches, the carotid and subclavian; and although a certain portion of blood would still continue to pass along the innominata to those branches of the subclavian on the cardiac side of the ligature, the ligature being necessarily placed on the subclavian artery after it emerges from

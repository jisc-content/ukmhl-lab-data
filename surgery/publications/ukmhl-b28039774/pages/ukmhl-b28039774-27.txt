ANEURISM. 1! of the deep and superficial femoral arteries would be fully adequate to the nourishment ot the limb. Mr. Hunter established his principle of opera - First adopted ~ i i , • in Popliteal ting by tying' the superficial femoral artery in cases Aneurism, of Popliteal aneurism ; and though he failed in his first operations,, yet the principle which he then established emboldened other Surgeons,, more par- ticularly those in this country, to act upon it, and hence, modern surgery has been enriched by a series of the most bold and splendid operations, whereby arterial trunks of the first order of mag- nitude have been successfully tied for the cure of aneurism. Mr. Abernethy, upwards of 25 years ago, was in trunks of the thus emboldened to tie the trunk of the external Magnitude!'1 iliac in an aneurism of the inguinal artery. The late Mr.Keate tied the subclavian artery for the cure of an axillary aneurism. Dr. Mott, of New York, applied a ligature to the Innominata. Sir Astley Cooper tied the carotid; and finally, the same distinguished Surgeon secured the Aorta itself. When the Hunterian operation is performed, as Effects of the I have already noticed, the changes which take°pelatI0n‘ place in the sac are similar to those which are observed when an aneurism undergoes a sponta- neous cure. The circulation in the part of the Languor of vessel between the ligature and tumor, and also ' u at M ' the current of blood in the tumor itself, is dimi- nished. The blood being more or less in a state of rest, the coagulating process is allowed to Blood r coagulates, proceed, the contents of the sac to consolidate, and the sides of the artery coalesce.

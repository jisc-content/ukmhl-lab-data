62 THE NEW OPERATION. Necessary di- minution in the force of circula- tion not ascer- tained. Probably very small. strictly imitating the process which nature herself had commenced. I was thus led to act on a new view in this operation, and was naturally induced to consider the important question, to what extent is it necessary to diminish the momentum of the circulation through an aneurism, before the blood contained in it will coagulate? If I were able to ascertain this, it is evident that I could at once point out with accuracy, those aneurisms in which it would be practicable to cure the disease by tying the artery, or arteries, at the distal side of the tumor. Now, in examining the cases where nature had performed a spontaneous cure, on the principle of forming by degrees a barrier to the circulation in the sac by an obstruction in the vessel beyond it, it appeared indisputable, that a process of coagulation in the aneurismal sac must have begun when the momentum of blood in it could have been but very slightly diminished, no more alteration having taken place in the circu- lation than what might be supposed to be the effect of an enlargement of the calibre of the arte- rial tube, at the diseased part; neither can it be supposed that the vessels which were obliterated, in the cases to which I allude, could have under- gone any thing like a sudden or instantaneous ob- struction ; on the contrary, whatever the process may have been, the arteries seemed to have under- gone a gradual obstruction, indicated by the slow diminution in the force of their pulsation. That a very moderate degree of diminution in the impetus

OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 55 tubes* if a barrier or ligature be placed upon a vessel* say an inch beyond the point where it gives off a branch* almost instantly the fluid in that part of the canal will cease to circulate* and be nearly in a state of stagnation; the quantity of the fluid being also diminished in proportion to the degree of elasticity and collapse of the sides of the vessel. On this principle we can readily explain* indeed might have anticipated* the im- mediate diminution of an aneurismal tumor when a ligature is placed on the vessel on its distal side. With regard to the hemorrhage which took See page 48. place in the third case* it is important to remark, that the blood in this instance flowed from the distal* and not from the cardiac orifice of the ar- tery ; the aneurismal sac and portion of the vessel between it and the ligature being plugged up with coagulated lymph* and having become quite im- pervious. Is it not probable that hemorrhage Hemorrhage, has often taken place in like manner from the ulceration of the artery beyond the ligature after the Hunterian operation ? And may not this ex- plain the circumstance* not very unusual* of lie- morrhages after such operations being sometimes so easily stopped* the motion of the blood being in such instances retrograde* coming from the distal orifice, and being supplied merely by the anas- tamosing capillaries or collateral branches pass- ing into the artery beyond the ligature? And may not this be the reason why hemorrhages from arteries tied for the cure of aneurisms* are more

15 ANEURISM. the circumstance of circulation in the tumor being carried on even after the artery was tied, ought not to be considered as an objection to Mr. Hunters operation. I shall however have occasion to point out the importance of this pathological fact, and to en- deavour to demonstrate, that it enables us to esta- blish a new principle for operating in aneurisms Establishes a so situated, as hitherto to have been considered be- of operation, yond the reach of art, and to which the Hunterian principle of operating is totally inapplicable. Revival of Brasdors Operation. Those aneurismal swellings so situated that the knife of the surgeon could not reach the vessel between the tumor and the heart, have hitherto been deemed incurable. Brasdor indeed, a professor in the ancient Boyer, Traite school of surgery in Paris, upwards of forty years Tom?ii.ad*Ch r ago made a proposal in his lectures of another mode of operating for aneurism, which was to place a ligature on the aneurismal artery on the distal, in place of the cardiac side of the sac, as recom- mended by Hunter. Dessault was also in the habit of mentioning Dessauit first this proposal in his surgical lectures, and seemed SoX^propo^i" to think that, in cases of aneurism where the situation of the tumor was such as to render the other operation impracticable, Brasdors proposal might be worthy of trial. But this justly cele- brated Surgeon never embraced any opportunity

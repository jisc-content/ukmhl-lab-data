54 FOURTH CASE OF CAROTID ANEURISM Preferable to Hunter. in the treatment of aneurism* and the utility of its application, this mode of operating* is more particularly ap- plicable to aneurisms in which the artery is so situated that it is impracticable to place a ligature on the cardiac side of the sac. Its application however* does not appear to me limited to such cases* being persuaded that future experience will confirm the observation I have already made, that the diminution of the tumor* from the ready escape of a quantity of its contents along the artery into the main trunk will* in many cases* render the operation of Brasdor preferable to that of Hunter* more particularly when the tumor is large* and likely to inflame after the circula- tion is interrupted through the sac; and also* as there is probably less risk of hemorrhage from the part of the vessel on which the ligature is applied in this* than in the Hunterian operation. The sudden diminution of the tumor which took place immediately on the application of the ligature on its distal side* was to me an unforeseen advan- See page 27. tage of this operation; at first conceiving that there would be an increased impetus of blood against the parietes of the sac; and thus if the sides were very much attenuated* there would then be danger of the operation causing them to burst* or to become highly inflamed from the increased distension. But taking a simple mechanical view of the subject* such an effect need not have been anti- cipated ; for supposing the arteries simple elastic Cause of im- mediate dimi- nution of the tumor.

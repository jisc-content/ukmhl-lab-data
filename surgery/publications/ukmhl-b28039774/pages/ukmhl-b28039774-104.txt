ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA 88 Or the branch which remains open. Conclusion. tumor would follow than if the subclavian were tied; it not being practicable to apply a ligature on that vessel without leaving four large branches between the ligature and the sac. I have been taking for granted that the calibre of the carotid and subclavian is about equal. When under these assumed circumstances the carotid has been tied,, the propriety of afterwards placing a ligature on the subclavian, must be de- cided by the effects produced on the aneurism, as well as on the system of the patient. On the other hand, when in a case where either the carotid or subclavian is already obliterated by a spontaneous process of cure, then am I strongly impressed with the propriety of tying the vessel which remains open, all other circumstanses being favourable. Of course no such operation would be advisable, when there was any reasonable pro- spect of the spontaneous curative process advanc- ing ; but if, notwithstanding the general treatment adopted, the tumor were decidedly to increase, I would not then hesitate to tie the open vessel. In advocating this principle of operating for aneurism, I am well aware that it has already been successfully practised and recommended by several intelligent surgeons: there are, however, many difficulties and prejudices to overcome, and the doctrines I have now brought forward will call forth warm discussion, and doubtless severe criti- cism. From this, however, science will derive an

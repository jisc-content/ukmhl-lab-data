ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA, &C, 67 found to be produced by a pulsating tumor of the size of a turkeyâ€™s egg, whose base is sit uated under the upper portion of the sternum, while its apex emerges completely from the cavity of the chest, appearing in the neck at the tracheal side of the sterno-mastoid muscle. This tumor, though in some degree compressible, cannot be entirely emptied of its contents; its pulsations are vigorous, and synchronous with those of the heart. The strongest pressure applied to it will not stop the circulation of blood through the subclavian artery, although it diminishes the quantity which is trans- mitted by that vessel. The neck itself presents a remarkable appear- Change in the . . . r r form of the ance, the right side being much less full and neck, plump than the left. The left half, particularly in the situation of the sterno-mastoid muscle, being more prominent than natural, whilst, in the right side, there is a distinct hollow in the course of the carotid artery, the tracheal edge of the mastoid muscle being reflected inwards. No pulsation can1,1 the PnLsa- 0 1 tions of the be discovered in any of the branches of the right carotids, carotid artery, although they have been most minutely examined; but in those of the left, the circulation is extremely vigorous. A pulsation in the course of the trunk of the right carotid is very perceptible, but this does not seem to arise from circulation in that vessel, but from an impulse communicated by the tumor, a like pulsation being evident in every other part of the right side of the neck,

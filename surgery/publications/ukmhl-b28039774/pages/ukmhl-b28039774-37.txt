21 ANEURISM. contract, the coagulum will be absorbed, some portions in contiguity with the sac will become organized and consolidate, others if the quantity be very large, will escape by a process of ulcera- tion through the skin, and ultimately a gradual coalescence of the tumor will thus take place. Now all these phenomena, are precisely those Analogy with ii* i the spontaneous which are to be observed during one ot the modes mode of cure, which nature employs in the spontaneous cure of aneurism. We observe that whenever the aneu- rism is so large, or so shaped that the circulation of blood in any part of it is altered in its course, or diminished in its impetus, then coagulation commences, and it proceeds until the cavity of the aneurism is obliterated. If the aneurismal tumor be of a moderate bulk, its contents are afterwards absorbed, and its parietes coalesce. But when the tumor is very large, nature removes some of the coagulum by producing an ulceration of the sac and superincumbent integuments, and See Appendix 1 and Plate. thus evacuates such coagula as cannot be removed by the process of absorption; in such instances the artery is plugged up as in cases of mor- tification. I may here observe with regard to the sponta- neous cure of aneurism, that though nature cures this disease on certain principles, derived from the peculiar functions of the coats, as well as contents of the arteries, vet she diversifies her practical application of these means according to the place where the aneurism is situated, or

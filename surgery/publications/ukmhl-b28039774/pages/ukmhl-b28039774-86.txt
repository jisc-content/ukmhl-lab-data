70 ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA, External incisions. fully four inches in length, and the other parallel with, and immediately above the edge of the cla- vicular portion of the mastoid muscle. These two incisions met at an angle upon that muscle close to its insertion in the clavicle; the superior termination of the incision extended close to the external jugular vein, which was not endangered. Instead of first dissecting back the skin, and then the platysma myoides and cervical fascia succes- sively, I made the incision at once through these parts, safely guided in doing this by cutting down at once as deep as the fibres of the sterno-mastoid muscle. I was thus enabled by one dissection, to raise a triangular flap formed of skin, platysma myoides, and fascia. By this method, the supra- clavicular space was distinctly exposed, and the numerous veins and arteries were only once di- vided. I allowed the bleeding of these, which was by no means profuse, to cease, and it was not necessary to tie any of the divided vessels. The remaining part of the operation was per- formed with a blunt-edged silver knife, and so tri- fling was the hemorrhage, that every part concerned in the subsequent steps of the operation could be distinctly seen. The fat which fills up the supra-clavicular cavity in which the subclavian artery lies, was pushed aside, and the deep fascia which extends between the omo-hyoideus muscle and the first rib, and which in this case was remark ably strong, Ligature placed was eXp0Se(j.

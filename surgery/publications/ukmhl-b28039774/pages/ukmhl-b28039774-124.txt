108 ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA AND along with the coagulum. In cutting into its substance I found it consisting of distinct layers, as in a common aneurism. There was no part of it which had the appearance of being recently formed, and, therefore there cannot be any doubt of its haying existed for a considerable time before the man’s death. It is obvious then, that in this case a coagulum had formed in the carotid artery, undergoing the same process as in aneurism, and that the tendency to aneurism had remedied itself. The whole cavity being filled up with the coagu- lum, there was no circulation whatever in this part; hence the cause of further dilatation was removed, and there was no danger of the rupture of the vessel, which is the principal danger in this disease.” Aneurism of the Innominata and root of the Ca- rotid and Subclavian Arteries. The following is an extract of the case, to which I alluded in page 17, made from the va- luable work of the late Mr. Allan Burns. In this patient I had proposed to place a ligature on the carotid artery, but the operation was opposed by the other surgeons who were consulted. I am now however convinced, from the appearance of the parts on dissection, and result of the opera- tions which I have since performed, that the aneu- rism in this patient might have been cured by tying one, or both branches of the innominata.

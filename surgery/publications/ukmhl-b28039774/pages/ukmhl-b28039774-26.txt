TREATMENT OF LO Ariel’s case. Principle of Hunter’s Operation. Anel, to whom surgery is indebted for many valuable improvements, first conceived, in order to avoid the dangers of the operation then in com- mon use, the idea of tying the diseased vessel above, or on the cardiac side of a popliteal aneurism. This principle was not however established until the time of John Hunter, when that extraor- % dinary man pointed out and executed the mode of operating, which has since been universally adopted, and which has justly been considered one of the greatest improvements in practical surgery. The operation by Hunter consists in placing the ligature on the cardiac side of the tumor, but at a greater or less distance from it, thus not only avoiding all the difficulties and dangers of opening the sac, but also procuring a sound portion of the artery on which to apply the ligature. Mr. Hunter was led to contemplate this prin- ciple, as particularly applicable to aneurisms of the popliteal artery, from the circumstance, that the old operation was here very difficult to accom- plish, while the artery, at a considerable distance above the tumor, may be tied with great facility. The only circumstance which could have been argued against the propriety of this operation, was the danger of the limb not having a sufficient supply of blood, if the artery were obliterated high up in the thigh; but a multitude of facts gave Mr. Hunter assurance that the freedom of anastamosis which subsists between the branches

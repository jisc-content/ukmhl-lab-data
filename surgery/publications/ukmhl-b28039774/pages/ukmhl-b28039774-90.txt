ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA, 74 How to be explained. opposite side, the blood thus arriving at the trunk from its extreme ramifications. This opinion seemed to be strengthened by the fact, that the pulsation was at first stronger in the temporal branch, than in the carotid itself. It appeared however to me, to be a more plausible way of accounting for this circumstance, by supposing that the aneurismal tumor, which formerly rose high in the neck, had previous to the operation compressed the carotid, and thus prevented the circulation of blood through it; but the swelling having now, by the effects of the ligature become greatly diminished, the pressure had ceased, and a free course now existed for the traject of the blood. This fact has been observed, and the opi- nion entertained, by former pathologists. What- ever explanation may appear the most likely, the occurrence itself cannot be at all regretted, since the tumor having subsequently continued gra- dually to diminish, it tends only to prove more completely the truth of those principles which I advanced, and from a knowledge of which the propriety of the operation was deduced; and although, had the vessel been altogether blocked up, the aneurismal tumor would by this time have completely disappeared, yet, even with the circulation of blood through the carotid, that end will in all probability ultimately arrive. Be that however as it may, the patient has been brought from a state of great suffering, to one of comfort, bordering on health.

THE NEW OPERATION. 65 equal in diameter to their trunk, it will then Application of follow, that if the right carotid be impervious, IneurisrosPof and the subclavian be obstructed at the pointtheinnorninala* already mentioned no blood will pass through the innominata, except such a quantity as is sufficient to supply the four open branches of the subcla- â€¢ vian, and which quantity will be about one-third only of the mass that would circulate through the innominata were its two great branches not ob- structed; hence, the blood contained in an aneu- rism of the innominata, would have its circulation diminished nearly two-thirds. It may be argued, that the four open branches of the subclavian will perform the function of the trunk which is shut up, and by their enlargement cause as much blood to flow through the innominata as used to pass before the ligature was applied. But whatever be the site of the vessels which ultimately supply the place, and perform the func- tion of the subclavian, it is quite evident, that in the first instance, the force of the current of blood is not directed exclusively into those branches of the subclavian which remain open between the cardiac side of the ligature and the innomi- nata, but must be diffused into all the contiguous branches of the aorta in the ratio of their different sizes. And this reasoning is in strict confor- mity with the important observation of Sir Astley see page 12. Cooper, already quoted, that though a few branches, and those too, near the site of an obliterated arte- rial trunk perform ultimately its functions, yet at first the circulation is carried on by numerous F

ANEURISM. 17 in a case of aneurism of the external iliac artery, which extended into the abdomen, so high as to render it impracticable to tie the artery on the cardiac side of the tumor. The femoral artery was therefore tied between the origins of the epi- gastric artery, and the profunda. The pulsation afterwards continued, but the tumor did not increase after the operation. The aneurism dimi- nished so considerably, that it was conceived that if its diminution continued, it would then be pos- sible to have the internal iliac artery tied on the cardiac side of the tumor. The aneurism however Result fatal, burst, and the patient died in consequence of the extravasation of blood, in the adjacent cellular membrane. These were the only cases in which this mode of operating had been adopted from the time of its proposal by Brasdor, until about three years Operation re- ago, when I had myself an opportunity in a case Author.y ^ of aneurism at the root of the carotid artery, of putting it to the test of a fair trial. Seventeen years ago I had seen, with my friend Dr. Monro, a patient who had an aneurism of the See Appendix, arteria innominata, and root of the carotid, and I was very anxious in this case to have tied the carotid artery, but the vessel had only been once secured at that period for the cure of aneurism, according to the Hunterian principle, so that the patient was left to his fate. The dissection after- wards however, shewed that it was an example of aneurism well calculated for the practice. c

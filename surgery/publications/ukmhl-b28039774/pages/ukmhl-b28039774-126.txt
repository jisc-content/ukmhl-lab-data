110 ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA AND Its position. Remarks. Operation condemned. stronger. In both arms the pulse was regular when I examined it, but during the two preceding days I was informed that it had been intermittent. In regard to the tumor itself, it was placed in part beneath the clavicular portion of the sterno-mas- toid muscle, but the greatest part of it lay nearer to the acromion than the muscle. By pressure the tumor could be nearly emptied, but while doing this he complained of considerable uneasi- ness. So soon as the pressure was removed, the sac became again distended, and the blood on entering it communicated a whizzing sensation to the finger. The impulse was at the same time great; and on the contraction of the ventricle the sac became exceedingly tense, and the throbbing and whirlpool-like motion of its contents were conspicuous features of the disease. The innomi- nata was felt beating at the top of the sternum, apparently in no degree enlarged. The common carotid acted more freely than on the opposite side.

I earnestly wished to be of use to him, and he declared his readiness to submit to any operation. Yet who could urge an operation in such a case ?

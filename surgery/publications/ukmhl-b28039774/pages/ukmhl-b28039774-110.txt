ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA 94 Appearance of the tumor, March 10, 1828. in walking fast up a hill. These symptoms con- tinued until the 6th of March; when he had an attack of bronchitis. His expectoration was co- pious; consisting of mucus slightly streaked with blood; and his cough came on in violent paroxyms, which were followed by a sense of suffocation.

The tumor was greatly diminished by firm pressure, but could not be made entirely to disappear. The pulsation of the tumor, which was synchro- nous with that of the heart, was increased in force by pressure upon the right subclavian artery, and was diminished, and sometimes completely ar- rested, by pressure upon the right carotid. The pulsations of the right carotid and subclavian arteries were stronger than those of the left; but there was no apparent difference in the pulsations of the radial arteries. As soon as the tumor made its appearance, the cough and dyspnoea ceased to be troublesome, and his health was soon re-established. His chest sounded well upon percussion, and the respiratory murmur was distinctly heard all over it. No un- natural pulsation could be detected, by the use of the stethoscope, between the tumor and the heart. A loud and powerful pulsation was heard

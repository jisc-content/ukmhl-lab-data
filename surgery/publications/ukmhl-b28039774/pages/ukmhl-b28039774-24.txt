Aneurism is a disease of so peculiar and dangerous a character, that its treatment must necessarily have engaged much of the attention of Surgeons. Accordingly we find, that at different periods, various methods have been promulgated by which the disease might be alleviated. The different modes which have been succes- sively employed for the treatment of Aneurism, are all in strict imitation of those natural or spontaneous processes of cure which have been mentioned. As it is the force of the circulation which causes the enlargement in an aneurismal tumor, as well as its ultimate rupture, and as the coagulating process, or the formation of laminated coagulable lymph within the sac proceeds more or less quickly; according as the force of the circulation is dimi- nished ; hence is to be explained the rationale of Valsalva’s system of treatment, which he, as well as others since his time, have in many instances successfully adopted. Indeed depletion has in some cases been carried to a very great extent, and Valsalva recommended that blood should be removed by repeated bleedings, even until the patient is reduced to the last stage of weakness. Under such circumstances, the great languor of circulation which is induced, will enable the

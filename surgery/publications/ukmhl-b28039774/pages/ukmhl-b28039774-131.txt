ROOT OF THE CAROTID AND SUBCLAVIAN. 115 Dissection. The dissection proved highly in- teresting. Appearances presented, which had not been expected; the vessel which I supposed to have been most materially affected was found perfectly healthy. The aneurism arose from the aorta, and included innominata a considerable part of the innominata; the right subclavian subclavian artery was only slightly dilated at itsdlseased* root; along its course, it was rather reduced in size. The tumor mounted from the aorta con- siderably above the sternum, pressing in its ascent the descending vena cava to the right, and the trachea to the left; obstructing thus the breathing, and intercepting the return of the venous blood from the head and arms. It also pressed the root of the right subclavian artery and the carotid against the spine, retarding in this way the circu- lation along these vessels. The trachea was so * much displaced, that the left carotid slanted across its front to reach the sides of the neck. The right Also the heart, side of the heart is little affected; the left ven- tricle is much thickened, and the aortic valves are in part ossified, which, together with the obstruc- tion of the circulation arising from the pressure of the tumor on the right carotid and subclavian arteries, will explain the increased strength of the muscular fibres of the ventricle. Just above the Aorta dilated, heart the aorta is somewhat dilated; I say dilated, See plate because its coats are healthy, and its canal free from lymphatic incrustation. This swell termi- nates below the commencement of the arch. The

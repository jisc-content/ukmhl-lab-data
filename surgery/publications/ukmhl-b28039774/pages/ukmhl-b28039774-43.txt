OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 27 taken up. After a careful dissection, which was tedious from its being necessary to tear the attach- ments with the silver knife, the artery was so com- pletely separated from the adjacent parts, that the point of the finger could be readily passed between the vessel and the vertebrae, and Mr. Bremnerâ€™s needle, of which I have annexed a particular de- scription,* was passed round the artery with great facility, taking care to avoid the par vagum, which was distinctly felt behind the finger. The vessel its ligature, being previously ascertained to be healthy, one liga- ture was tied round it, as close to the tumor as the incision would admit, and the lips of the wound were stitched together by a suture, without any further dressings. The aneurismal tumor was covered with adhesive plaster, in order to protect the tender skin, and at the same time to keep up a certain degree of pressure. I thought it probable that the resistance to the immediate di- . ... minution of the circulation, which the ligature would necessarily aneurism, occasion, might, for a short while at least, after its application, be followed by an increase in the distention of the tumor; instead of which, how- ever, there was an immediate diminution of its bulk, marked by a considerable corrugation of the skin at the base, as well as a decrease in its redness. The ligature of the artery did not seem to produce any change in the mental functions, or any unna- tural feelings in the head; on the contrary, the patient passed the night after the operation more * See the Appendix.

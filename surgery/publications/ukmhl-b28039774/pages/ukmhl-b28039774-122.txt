aneurism of the innominata. 106 sac, the aneurismal opening was found to be in the arteria innominata, about an inch in extent, commencing at about half an inch from its origin, and reaching to its division, the coats retaining their healthy appearance; and this appearance terminated in an abrupt line where the parietes of the aneurismal sac commenced. At the lower part of this space, the orifice of the innominata was seen; at the upper part, and towards one side, that of the subclavian. No carotid could be See plate, with here discovered, but on passing a probe along this explanation. . n j • . pr* i , •. artery trom above, resistance was ottered to its progress at about half an inch from the point where the vessel might be expected to open into the sac ; this, however, was overcome with a slight force, and the instrument passed on till its point was perceived through a semitransparent mem- brane which was stretched over the orifice of the artery, and appeared to be continuous with the living membrane of the innominata, preventing the passage of the probe into the cavity of the sac. Between the tumor and first branch of the sub- clavian was a portion of vessel half an inch in length, and perfectly healthy. A coagulum about the size of a walnut occupied that portion of the sac behind the upper part of the sternum, and layers of the same nature, about the thickness of half an inch, were found at the upper and inner part, where the tumor was in contact with the trachea.”

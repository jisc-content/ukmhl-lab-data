Now there are no less than five ways in which these may take place, though in all, the principle, which nature employs for the cure, is the same. The first of these is accomplished by the aneu- rismal sac being so strengthened and filled with coagulable lymph, that no fluid blood can pass into it, and of course all danger of rupture is pre- vented, whilst at the same time the original canal of the vessel remains pervious, and carries on the circulation. An aneurism may undergo a spontaneous cure, by not only the sac being filled with coagulable lymph, but by the arterial canal being also obli- terated. An aneurism may also be cured by the tumor acquiring such a size and position, that by press- ing on the trunk of the artery above or below, the sides of the aneurism are thus brought into con- tact, and adhere. Such a case was first described by that enlightened pathologist Sir Everard Home, and similar cases have also been related by Scarpa. A spontaneous cure of aneurism has also been known to take place, where the whole circum- ference of the vessel has been dilated, the sac being filled up with coagulum, but leaving a canal in the midst of the tumor through which the blood continued to pass*. An aneurism may be cured by a process of sup- * Vide Hodgsonâ€™s excellent work on the diseases of the arteries.

The salivation appeared to be connected with the state of the digestive appa- ratus ; for as soon as ale and a generous diet were allowed, it gradually subsided. I am at a loss to assign the cause of the numbness and de- bility of the whole of the right side of the body, (which were only observed when he first left his bed), unless they originated in a greater quantity of blood circulating in the left hemisphere of the brain than in the right, which undoubtedly would be the case after the application of a ligature to the common carotid.

In conclusion, it is worthy of notice, that, since

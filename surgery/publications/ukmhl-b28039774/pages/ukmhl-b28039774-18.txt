PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS 2 Hunter’s experiments. Structure of the sac. Of the coa- gulura. that aneurisms arose only in that way. The dis- sections however, and observations of other patho- logists, have clearly proved, that an aneurismal tumor may be formed without any rupture of the fibrous or inner coats, and merely by a dilatation of all the coats of the vessel. When an aneurism is formed by a rupture of the internal and fibrous or middle coats, there is generally a transverse fissure found in the tube of the artery, and this is sometimes irregular or ragged; hence the dilatation of the cellular coat forms a tumor, which is more or less prominent. Endeavours have been made artificially to imitate the formation of an aneurism by experi- ments on animals. For this purpose John Hunter laid bare the carotid artery of a dog, and after- wards “ skinned it with a knife even to trans- parency.” No dilatation of the vessel took place. Three weeks afterwards the animal was killed, and the artery on which the experiment was made, in place of being dilated, where the external tunic had been detached, was found thickened by the inflammation and subsequent adhesion of the ad- jacent cellular structure. In examining the sac of an aneurismal tumor, it is observed that the coats of the vessel are more or less thickened, and the cellular or external sheath is connected with, and adheres to the surrounding cellular structure. The aneurismal sac is more or less filled with coagulable lymph, and this lymph is always found formed in laminse, these being

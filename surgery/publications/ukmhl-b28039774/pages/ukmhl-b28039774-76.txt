THE NEW OPERATION. 60 operations, together with discoveries from dissec- tions, have led me to advance a step further, and I Their practical trust, that I shall now be enabled to communicate vitilit the knowledge of a principle for the cure of many aneurisms, which have hitherto been considered beyond the reach of art. Although, as I have already mentioned, some surgeons have considered, that in order to allow the process of coagulation to go on in an aneurism, it is necessary to put a complete stop to the cir- culation of the blood in the tumor, it is well known, and many instances are on record, where, after the femoral arterv had been tied in cases of popliteal aneurism, the tumor for weeks, and even months, continued to pulsate, and yet the coagulation of the contents of the sac was ulti- Coaguiation, mately established. A knowledge of this circum- in an aneurism, stance alone would, we might suppose, have led to the adoption of Brasdor s operation, in those aneurisms in which the circulation of the blood in the tumor could only be partially arrested; and thus would have led pathologists to inquire, what was the necessary degree to which the circulation in the tumor must be diminished, in order to admit of the coagulation of its contents. Complete stop- But by far the most interesting and conclusive r • Kfon°notrcu' arguments to elucidate the important point, which necessary. j am g0 desirous to establish for the cure of aneu- rism, are to be deduced from the observations which have been made on the spontaneous cure of the disease. And it is a curious circumstance,

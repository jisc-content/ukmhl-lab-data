48 THIRD CASE OF CAROTID ANEURISM. Distal orifice pervious. was an ulcerated opening on the anterior and tracheal surface of the carotid artery, a quarter of an inch in length and rather less in breadth, covered by a coagulum of dark-coloured lymph, communicating with the opening in the integu- ments. The posterior surface of the artery, cor- responding with the ulcerated opening on the anterior part, was covered with a coagulum, and on removing this the division of the internal and middle coat produced by the ligature was ob- served.—Above the ulcerated opening the carotid artery was pervious and healthy, with the excep- tion of a few spots, resembling those observed in the arteria innominata; and there did not appear to have been any attempt made to effect oblitera- tion. The superior thyroideal artery, given off a little higher than usual, was readily distended by throwing water into the arch of the aorta, which passing through the left carotid artery, regurgi- tated by means of anastomosing branches, through the right external, internal, and common carotid artery, and flowed out at the wound. The trunk of the superior thyroideal became very manifestly enlarged on injecting the water fom the aorta.”

38 THIRD CASE OP CAROTID ANEURISM Diagnosis. in the neck. With respect to the formation of the tumor, the patient stated, that she first per- ceived, some months ago, a beating or throbbing at the lower part of the neck; this symptom be- came gradually more evident, until at length a small tumor made its appearance, which by de- grees attained the size, and presented the cha- racters, I have described. There could be no doubt that the disease was aneurismal, and apparently affecting the lower part of the right common carotid artery; but whether confined to that vessel, or extending into the arteria innominata, was to me a matter of conjecture, for I am free to confess that I know of no certain diagnostic marks, by which we can discriminate between aneurism at the root of the right carotid artery, and aneurism of the arteria innominata, presenting, as it usually does, a tumor at the lower part of the neck. This, however, is not of the moment which at first sight it appears to be; for, as I shall have occasion presently to remark, the operation of tying the artery above the tumor, is expedient in either case. It occurred to me, therefore, that the only chance which could be afforded to the patient was, that of applying a ligature to the artery above the tumor.

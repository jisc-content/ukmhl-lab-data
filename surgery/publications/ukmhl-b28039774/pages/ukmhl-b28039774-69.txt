OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 53 and as long narrations never fail to exhaust the most studious, I have thought proper to condense the remainder of this case. Until the 14th day Reports, she required four small bleedings, to keep down Stp’14,1827< arterial action, and ease pain of the right side of the heart; gentle enemata were employed to re- gulate her bowels; her respiration and degluti- tion rapidly improved; her food consisted of strong beef tea and jelly, and she had easy nights, without the slightest tendency to orthopncea, from which she had suffered much previous to the ope- ration ; the tumor rapidly decreased, and its pul- sations became more weak. The ligature was cast off on the 19th dav, and the wound was healed on the 27th, at which period she left her bed, the tumor being reduced to one half its bulk, and almost free from pulsation. At the present time, April 19th, she is in per- Success of the feet health; there is scarcely a remnant of the^,^19,1828. tumor, the inordinate action of the heart has ceased, and her respiration and deglutition are natural.” Observations. The foregoing cases of Carotid Aneurism, seem Brasdor’s to me to prove indisputably, that the future growth established, of an aneurismal tumor may be arrested, and its parietes consolidated, by placing a ligature on an artery on the distal side of the sac, when no branch intervenes between the sac and the ligature. An important practical point is thus established

40 THIRD CASE OP CAROTID ANEURISM bitter infusions, with carbonate of soda, and at- tention to the state of the bowels. On the first of March I undertook the operation, in the presence of Mr. Wardrop, Mr. B. Cooper, and Mr. Callaway. The steps which I pursued were nearly as follows: the patient being placed on a table with her head elevated, and slightly turned towards the left side, I commenced by making an incision through the skin and cellular membrane, of about three inches in length. The incision was made obliquely—that is, in the direc- tion of the fibres of the mastoid muscle, and at a short distance to the inner side of its tracheal edge. I continued to dissect, layer by layer, gra- dually and cautiously, until I ascertained by my finger, that I was near upon the trunk of the artery, when I laid aside the scalpel, and used a silver knife. The process of separating and de- taching the artery from its adjacent cellular membrane, by means of a blunt instrument, ren- dered this part of the operation tedious, but at length it was effectually accomplished, and the aneurismal needle (Bremner’s) was passed round the artery. The vessel appeared to be unusually large, but, in my opinion, was not unhealthy; one ligature* was tied around it, the ends of which I cut close to the knot; the edges of the wound * The ligature (which I employed at the suggestion of Mr. Wardrop) is known by the name of fisherman’s silk 5 it is, I believe, a vegetable product.

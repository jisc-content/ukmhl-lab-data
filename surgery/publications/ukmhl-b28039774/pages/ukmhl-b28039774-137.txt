EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. PLATE I. In this Plate are represented different modes by which an Aueurism may undergo a spontaneous cure, as explained in page 6. Fig. 1. An Aneurismal Tumor, in which the sac is so filled with laminated coagulated lymph, that no fluid blood can cir- culate in it, and thus all danger of a rupture of the parietes of the Aneurism is completely prevented. At the same time the canal of the artery remains pervious, and carries on the circu- lation. “ This Aneurism originated from a circumscribed opening in the aorta about three quarters of an inch in diameter, in which space the coats of the vessel were evidently deficient. The sac was nearly filled with very firm and fleshy layers of coagulum, so that it was impossible it could have given way in any direction. This coagulum did not extend into the aorta, but wss arched over the opening into that vessel so as to leave a small cavity. Through the cavity the blood passed into the Arteria Innominata, which originated from the inferior and posterior part of the sac. The arched termination of the co- agulum had a membranous appearance on its surface. The sac adhered intimately to the trachea, and caused it to assume a remarkable curvature. The aorta was larger than usual. Its internal coat was of a deep red colour, and irregularly thickened. In some places it was converted into a cartilaginous, and in others into a steatomatous structure.” See Mr. Hodgson’s Work. Fig. 2 and 3 represents an Aneurism of the carotid artery, wherein a spontaneous cure had been effected by not only the sac being filled by laminated coagulated lymph, but also by the arterial canal itself being obliterated. This figure is copied from Dr. Baillie’s plate, and the case is given in page 107 of this work. Fig. 4. Artery where the whole circumference of the vessel

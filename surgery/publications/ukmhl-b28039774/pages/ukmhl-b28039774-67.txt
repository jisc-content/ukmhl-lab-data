OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 51 for two inches, in a direction corresponding to the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, by which the external jugular vein was exposed, crossing the centre of the wound. Fearing trouble- some haemorrhage from its division, I included it within two ligatures, and then cut between them; the cervical fascia and platysma being dissected off, the anterior edge of the sternomas- toid was readily brought into view, by the side of which lay a tortuous plexus of dilated veins; these being pushed off with the handle of the knife, I endeavoured to divaricate the lips of the wound with brass retractors, but from the tense state of the sterno-mastoid muscle I found it almost impossible, and the slightest attempt pro- duced much pain and more laboured respiration, with swelling of the cervical veins, and from these difficulties, added to the great depth at which the carotid lay, in consequence of the mag- nitude of the tumor forcing all the parts out of their natural situation, I found it necessary to divide the integuments on the upper part of the tumor to the extent of an inch, and by this ex- pedient I was enabled to lacerate the cellular tissue in the neighbourhood of the hyoides, which bone I at length reached, and found that it was situated between one and a half and two inches from the surface; then, by a little manipulation, I succeeded in pushing the tumor somewhat down- wards, and to the opposite side; thus exposing the sheath of the vessels, which, when I had

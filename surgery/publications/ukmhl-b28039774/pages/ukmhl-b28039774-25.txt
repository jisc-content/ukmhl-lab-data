TREATMENT OF ANEURISM. 9 coagulating process to go on, and thus the pari- etes of an aneurismal sac to be strengthened, so that a return of the natural force of the circula- tion will no longer cause an increase of the bulk of the tumor, but will be followed by its consoli- dation and gradual diminution. Compression has also been employed for the Compression, cure of aneurism. It is not however very easy to conceive how pressure, applied to the aneurismal tumor itself, should cure it. It appears to me, that success in such cases of aneurism ought rather to be attributed to the pressure acting on the vessel above or below the tumor, rendering the circulation in it more languid, and thus con- tributing to the formation of coagulum, in like manner as in the other modes of treatment. * The Hunterian Operation. As surgery improved, and as the insufficiency of these means became apparent, medical practi- tioners were emboldened, in favorable cases, to attempt an operation. The method which they at first employed was oid mode of to cut down into the aneurismal tumor, removeoperatlng' the coagula of blood, and then endeavour to tie the bleeding extremities of the vessel. This ope- ration, independent of the great difficulty of its execution, gave rise to numerous bad consequences which in a great majority of cases terminated the life of the patient.

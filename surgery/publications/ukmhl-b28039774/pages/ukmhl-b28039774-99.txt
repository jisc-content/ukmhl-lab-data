TREATED BY TYING THE SUBCLAVIAN. 83 innominata, and of the iliac arteries, where the tumor is formed so near the heart, and has ac- quired such a bulk, as to render placing a ligature on the artery between the tumor and heart, an impracticable operation. It is in such cases, 1 conceive, that the new operation may be peculiarly applicable, a class which, from their formidable and hitherto untractable nature, have generally pursued a fatal course. In the practical application of this new mode Diagnosis of c , . aneurisms of or operating tor aneurism, it will be ot great lm-the neck, portance to form an accurate diagnosis of aneu- rismal swellings in the neck, those particularly at the roots of the carotid and subclavian arteries, as well as those of the arteria innominata. This is generally esteemed extremely difficult; and erro- neous opinions have in several instances been formed as to the site of such tumors by most ex- perienced surgeons. I apprehend, however, that the difficulty of distinguishing aneurisms of these arteries from one another, has chiefly arisen from the circumstance of their having all been con- sidered incurable, at least by operation; and as far as general treatment has been concerned, the same system having been applicable to all of them, no one has even endeavoured to point out their diagnosis. From having had frequent opportu- nities of examining cases of this kind, since my attention was directed to this important subject, I think that aneurisms of these different vessels may generally be distinguished from one another â€¢

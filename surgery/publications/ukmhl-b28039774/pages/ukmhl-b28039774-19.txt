3 ON ANEURISMS. firmer the nearer they are to the coats of the sac. The coagulum in an aneurismal sac sometimes its vascularity ° . , not improbable. adheres so closely to the internal tunic, that it is not improbable that there exists a vascular connec- tion between them. There is no doubt, however, that this coagulable lymph, or at least the greater portion of it, is separated from the blood which circulates in the tumor, and is not effused from the surface of the internal membrane, in like manner as we observe lymph effused on the surface of inflamed serous membranes. It is not improba- ble, however, that some lymph may also be effused from the internal surface of the sac itself, and that such lymph, by its organization and intimate union with that deposited from the blood, may in time become an intermediate bond of living union between the coats of the sac and the mass of lami- nated coagulum. This connection has not been accurately ob- served nor pointed out by pathological inquirers; yet it is a fact of much interest and importance, and in my opinion bears a strong analogy with that coagulum which is formed in an artery when a ligature has been placed upon it, and which is termed the internal clot. This coagulum in- timately adheres to the sides of the vessel, at the place of the ligature, but its organization has never yet been with certainty demonstrated. In one instance John Hunter injected the coats Observation of of an artery on which a ligature had been applied, J°hn Huntcr*

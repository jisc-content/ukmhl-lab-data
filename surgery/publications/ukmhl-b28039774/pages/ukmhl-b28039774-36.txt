TREATMENT OF 20 Immediate di- minution of the tumor. The blood changes in its impetus and coagulates. Consolidation â– of the tumor of tying the ligature, the resistance thus given to the circulation would cause an increased impetus in the vessel to propel its contents, not only against the ligature, but against the parietes of the tumor. But this increase of impetus we know can continue but for a very short time; for when a vessel is divided or tied, in a few hours branches of the divided trunk, which can only be supplied by anastamosis, freely carry on the circulation; and the cases in which this operation was performed, and where the tumor was large, prove that instead of increasing, in a few minutes after the vessel was tied beyond it, the swelling diminished, a circum- stance which was ascertained by the skin covering it, which was tense and ready to burst, suddenly forming into wrinkles. If the circulation be turned into a new channel, and if that channel completely fulfil the purpose, the sac with its contents, as well as the portion of artery extending between the aneurism and the ligature, and also the blood contained in it, will now be in a passive state; and though the blood will continue for a certain time to be in- fluenced by the impulse of the circulation, carried on in that part of the vessel which passes into the tumor, still its motion must become not only languid, but its current irregular, a state which we know admits of its speedy coagulation. Whenever coagulation of the blood in the tumor does take place, then the cure of the aneurism may be said to be accomplished, the sac will

Cooper states, when speaking of the case of carotid aneurism, where he tied the artery on the cardiac side of the tumor, “ that the cause of her death was the inflammation of the aneurismal sac, and parts adjacent, by which the size of the tumor became increased so as to press on the pharynx, and prevent deglutition, and upon the larynx, so as to excite violent fits of coughing, and ultimately to impede respiration.” This congestion and in- flammation of the sac in cases of carotid aneurism, are serious evils attending the Hunterian opera- tion, but are avoided when the artery is tied on the distal side of the tumor; these effects would seem to prove that the action of the ligature was not merely mechanical but functional. If the femoral artery be tied for a popliteal aneurism, the anastamosing vessels enlarge, not merely by an increased impulse, a tergo, but there is an effort of the vis medicatrix naturae to supply the parts that have been deprived of their blood. Perhaps it is not one of the least important advantages of Brasdor’s mode of operating that the risk of secondary hemorrhage, will be greatly Comparative diminished. The ligature has here to perform lip'lnue!" °f <lu very different functions from what is required of it when placed between the tumor and the heart. Instead of being obliged to stem a strong current of blood until the internal coagulum is formed,

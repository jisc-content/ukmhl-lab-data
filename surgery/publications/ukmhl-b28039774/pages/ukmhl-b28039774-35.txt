ANEURISM. VJ With regard to the principle on which the operation, as proposed by Brasdor, cures an aneu- risinal tumor, I would first observe, that the changes which such an operation produces both Principle of ° . Brasdor’s ope- in the artery and sac, are precisely those which ration, nature employs when she cures the disease by a spontaneous process. When, according to Hunter’s method, a ligature is applied between the aneurism and the heart, the whole mass of blood contained between the ligature and tumor, as well as that in the tumor Compared with . ir. ill • i it that of Hunter. itselt, suddenly ceases to circulate, whilst the liga- ture has to resist the impulse of the blood in the opposite portion of the vessel, until the internal clot and the adhesion of the sides of the vessel are sufficient to prevent hemorrhage. The blood in the tumor subsequently coagulates, and the diminution and consolidation of the aneurism, and its artery afterwards, take place more or less quickly. Now let us consider what will happen if the ligature be placed beyond, or on the distal side of the aneurisinal tumor, and in a case where no branch either passes directly into the tumor or comes off from the trunk between the tumor and the ligature. No sooner is the ligature in such a case tied, and the usual course of circulation in- terrupted, than as after the Hunterian operation, the anastamosing vessels dilate and perforin the function of the obliterated or obstructed trunk. It might be expected that at the same moment

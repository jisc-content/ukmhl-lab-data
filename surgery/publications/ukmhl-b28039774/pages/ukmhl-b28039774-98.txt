The right carotid artery still pulsates, although not so strongly as the left; its pulsation corre- sponds to that of the heart, but its branch, the temporal artery, affords no indication of the cir- culation of blood; the right radial artery beats with about half the strength of the left. She suffers none of those pains in the regions of the neck, shoulder and back; nor has she, for a long time, experienced any of those severe head-achs which formerly gave her so much uneasiness; the oedema of the feet has entirely disappeared, and she takes exercise in the open air daily. The above report was drawn up a month ago, previous to her visit to the country, from which, in a letter received from her yesterday, she states that she is now in a better state of health than she has been for a long time.” Concluding Observations. Whilst the principle of Brasdor’s operation is fully established by the cases which have been described, it also appears to me, that the foregoing case of Mrs. Denmark, points out a new view of operating in another, and in a hitherto fatal class of aneurisms. The cases of aneurism in which the Hunterian operation is not applicable, are chiefly those of the carotid and subclavian arteries, of the arteria

64 THE NEW OPERATION. ance of other functions ; and hence the manifest How produced, differences to be observed in the modes by which different arteries are distributed, how some are ramified, how some vary in length, how others vary in their course; all these peculiarities assist- ing no doubt in performing a peculiar function, which can be no other than altering the velocity in the current of the blood before it arrives at the respective organs. Principle of To render more intelligible the principle of this new operation . c ,. . , , illustrated new mode ot operating in aneurisms, let me sup- pose, by way of illustration, that the right carotid and subclavian arteries into which the innominata is divided, are of equal diameters; it appears from those cases where the spontaneous cure had com- menced in the aneurism of the innominata, that the closure of one of these great branches was not alone sufficient to allow of the complete consolida- tion of the tumor. Suppose therefore, that besides the carotid, the circulation through the subclavian artery was arrested at the point where it emerges from between the scaleni muscles, a very consider- able diminution in the circulation of blood in the tumor would then be produced, and the arteria innominata, in place of having to transmit blood through the carotid and subclavian vessels, would only have to supply those branches of the subcla- vian which come off nearer the heart than the point where the ligature had necessarily been applied. Suppose, further, that these branches, which are usually four in number, when taken collectively are

26 FIRST CASK OF CAROTID ANEURISM Operation. External incision. Exposition of the artery. and internal^ the process of coagulation would not be interrupted by the continuance of circulation through collateral branches in immediate conti- guity with the aneurism. The operation also appeared practicable in this instance, as the aneu- rism, though large, still left sufficient space for the application of a ligature between the tumor and the division of the artery. Under these impressions, and with the appro- bation of Dr. Veitch and Mr. Glen, Surgeon of Brompton, who attended the patient, I undertook the operation, and the result of which has, in my opinion, fully authorised the measure; and I trust the future experience of others will confirm its utility. The operation consisted in making an incision through the skin and cellular membrane, rather more than an inch and a half in length, commencing it immediately above the tumor, and extending it on the tracheal edge of the mastoid muscle, and in the direction of the carotid artery, taking care to avoid the large superficial veins. The subsequent part of the dissection was chiefly made with a silver knife, guided by the finger; and there was no particular difficulty in reaching the artery but what might have been anticipated, from its great depth, from the necessary limits of the incision, and from the numerous large veins which were to be avoidedâ€”particularly a branch that extended across the middle of the incision to the internal jugular, and consequently dimi- nished the space in which the artery was to be

13 ANEURISM. “ would lead to a belief that anastamosing vessels would be numerous in proportion to the time which had elapsed from the operation, but the reverse of this is the fact; for at first many vessels convey the blood originally conducted by the principal artery; but gradually the number of these chan- nels becomes diminished, and after a length of time, a few vessels conveniently situated for the new circulation become so much enlarged as to be capable of conveying an equal portion of blood to that which passed through the original trunk.” The observations made by the late Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson’s also show how this process is accomplished, and his Lectures on , , ill! the Arteries, &c. how nature enlarges only one vessel, and that also nearly in the site of the divided one to supply its place. Mr. Wilson observed, that in a few hours after the division of a vessel on the sclerotica, one contiguous began to transmit red blood, gra- dually to enlarge, and in twenty four hours to acquire the bulk and assume apparently the site See also of the divided artery.

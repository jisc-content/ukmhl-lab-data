96 ANEURISM OP THE INNOMINATA Commenced April 3,1828. Symptoms aggrayated. Tumor in- He was accordingly ordered to bed, to be bled to the extent of eight ounces every third day ; his diet to consist of small quantities of gruel, broth, and tea. Small doses of digitalis were like- wise administered. This plan of treatment was continued until the 13th of July. During the first month there appeared some little improve- ment ; his pulse was frequently as low as 47 in the minute, the tumor became harder, its pulsa- tion less forcible, and more remote; from which it was supposed that coagula might be forming. The blood hitherto had seemed perfectly healthy; and it was noticed that if the bleeding were de- layed beyond the usual time, the symptoms were aggravated. In the beginning of May a great alteration for the worse took place, which was supposed to be owing to his taking a small quantity of animal food. The blood, after each bleeding, now became buffed; pulse 80 in the minute; the tumor rapidly increased in the course of a few days, and be- came very painful upon pressure. Twenty leeches were applied without any relief. A few days afterwards a diarrhoea supervened: the inflam- matory state of the tumor now abated, the pain ceased, and the swelling in some degree subsided. After this attack his pulse was never less frequent than 80 in the minute, although the same plan of treatment was rigidly adhered to. From this time until the 1st of July the tumor creases.

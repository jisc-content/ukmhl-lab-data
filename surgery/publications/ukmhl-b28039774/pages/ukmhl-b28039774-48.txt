SECOND CASE OF CAROTID ANEURISM 32 reduced, particularly in the tracheal portion. Pul- sation of the opposite carotid increased in force. The adhesive plaster was taken away; wound adheres ; no appearance of inflammation. Dec. 12. Pulse of the right arm continues much stronger than that of the left. Left carotid artery beats with increased force. Temporal artery of the right side can be felt, feebly pulsating. No per- ceptible change in the tumor since yesterday; whole wound appears to have completely adhered; no dressing required; no return of headache; health much improved: sat up and dressed herself, and is in excellent spirits. Tumor is easily dimi- nished in bulk, by gentle pressure; but on its application, complained that the pain of the head returned. She experienced two slight attacks of faintness yesterday afternoon, with pain in the bowels. Bowels confined; to take some salts and senna immediately. Dec. is. This morning she feels perfectly easy, the me- dicine having operated well; is quite free from all those pains in the head which troubled her previously to the operation, and she can lie down in bed on the left side without that feeling of suf- focation which was formerly the consequence of it. The pulsation is now confined to the external part of the tumor, and on pressing it the pains are reproduced (for the time) in the head, with the same violence as formerly. The two stitches were removed, perfect adhesion having taken place.

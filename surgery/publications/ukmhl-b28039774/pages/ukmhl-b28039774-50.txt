34 SECOND CASE OF CAROTID ANEURISM Dissection. Dissection. â€œ The body was generally anasarcous, the lower extremities being swollen to twice their natural size. The tumor, which had existed in the neck during life, was not apparent after death. The arterial system being that to which our attention was particularly directed, the thorax was opened, and the teguments of the neck removed. The heart presented an unusual state of hyyertroykia of both sides, being three times as large as natural. The serous membrane contained the usual quan- tity of serum found in similar cases, and appeared to have suffered from repeated attacks of inflam- mation, judging from the extent and thickness of the patches of organised lymph which had been previously effused from time to time. The aorta and arteria innominata presented nothing re- markable externally, but, internally, innumerable small yellow patches were observed, where ossific depositions had commenced.

The ca- rotid artery, immediately after its commence- ment, presented a manifest dilatation, which cor- responded with the situation of the tumor that existed prior to death ; and the fact of the vessels being perfectly empty, and their walls collapsed, readily accounted for the swelling having dis- appeared. The length of the dilated portion, was

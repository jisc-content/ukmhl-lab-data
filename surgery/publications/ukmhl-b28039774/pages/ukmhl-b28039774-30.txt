14 TREATMENT OF Sir Everard Home’s Obser- vation. Circulation continued in two ways. Diminished force of circula- tion sufficient. after the ligature had been placed on the superfi- cial femoral artery; and the important conclusion Sir Everard drew from that fact was., “ that simply taking off the force of the circulation from the aneurismal artery is sufficient to effect a cure of the disease, or at least to put a stop to its progress, and to leave the parts in a situation from which the actions of the animal oeconomy are capable of restoring them to their natural state.” Now, by subsequent observation it has been found, that the circulation through an aneurismal tumor has been continued after the trunk has been tied in two ways; the one, in consequence of some branch or branches passing from that portion of the vessel between the tumor and liga- ture continuing open and communicating by anas- tamosis with other trunks; the other by branches arising beyond the tumor anastamosing with other trunks. But in whatever mode the circulation has been kept up in the sac, the diminution in the force of circulation has been sooner or later suffi- cient to ensure the consolidation of the tumor, excepting in a few cases, and these have been in consequence of some unusual distribution of ves- sels, where the supply of blood into the tumor was so large as not to diminish the force of cir- culation to that degree necessary to admit of the process of coagulation. The knowledge of this fact, so distinctly stated by Sir E. Home, did not lead, however, to any practical inference, further than pointing out that

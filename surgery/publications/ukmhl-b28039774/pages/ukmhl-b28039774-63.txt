OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 47 artery was a consolidated tumor, of a pyramidal shape, its base below and extending two inches up the artery, and was at its lower part about half an inch in breadth. A probe could not be ^[^caTodd passed upwards, from the arteria innominata, andclosed- water forcibly injected at this part would not pass, so completely and effectually closed was the lower part of the carotid artery. On making a lon- gitudinal section of the tumor, we observed at its lower part a firm coagulum of blood, of about the size of a French olive ; it accurately closed Sac filled with J coagulum. the opening at the base of the carotid, and it was this which afforded the resistance to the probe and injection of water passing upward from the arteria innominata. The coats of the artery where Coats thick- surrounding the coagulum, were thickened toencd' about four times their natural size, and lined by a thin layer of fibrine. Above the coagulum the coats of the artery were thickened to the extent of at least six times their natural size, and in addi- tion to a layer of fibrine closely adherent to the inner surface of the artery, and continuous with that surrounding the coagulum at the lower part of the tumor, there were three other layers of coa- gulated lymph. They were evidently adapted to the cylindrical shape of the vessel, and appeared to have been formed successively, thus gradually encroaching upon and at length obliterating the entire calibre of the artery. At the upper part of this thickened state of the artery, and just above the omo-hyoideus, where the ligature was applied, ^7ukc'

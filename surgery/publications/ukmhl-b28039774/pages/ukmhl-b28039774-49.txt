OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 33 Thursday, Dec. 21. The patient is entirely free from any uneasiness in the head; has an excellent appetite, and states, that in every respect she is “ quite comfortable.” About three weeks after the operation she caught cold, and drank some spirits, after which she was seized with a violent cough, attended with fever; and it was observed that the tumor, which now remained in the neck, increased in bulk, and its pulsation became stronger. All these symptoms were relieved by a repetition of small bleedings, and she appeared to be convalescent. Three weeks after this, together with all the symptoms of hypertrophy of the heart indicated by a stetho- scopic examination, there came on a considerable oedema of both legs; the swelling of the lower extremities continued to augment, notwithstand- ing the use of a variety of diuretics; but the secre- tion of urine was increased by small bleedings from the arm, and occasional cuppings. She died on the 23d March, never having complained of the swelling in her neck, or of any symptoms re- ferrible to a disturbed circulation within the head, from the date of the operation, which was per- formed on the 10th of December. Up to the day of her death, a tumor remained in her neck of about the bulk of an almond, which pulsated strongly, felt very thin in its coats, and its contents could be readily squeezed out of it, but returned rapidly when the pressure was rer- rnoved.

The integuments* which had lost their redness* now evidently became more inflamed, and during the fifth and sixth days there was a distinct in- crease in the size of the tumor* and it pulsated more strongly* which seemed partly owing to several severe fits of coughing. This apparently unfavorable change was* however* followed by a decided amendment; and eight days after the operation the swelling again began to diminish* and the pulsation became more obscure* so that on the fourteenth day it was not much larger than half its bulk at the time of the operation, and no pulsation could be detected in any portion of it; merely a slight vibration in some parts* which seemed to be produced by the pulsations of the contiguous vessels which were now enlarged* particularly the inferior thyroid artery. The redness of the skin, however, continued to increase* and that of the scapular portion of the tumor to become more and more of a purple colour* till* at last* ulceration commenced on the most prominent part.

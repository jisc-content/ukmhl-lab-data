56 FOURTH CASE OF CAROTID ANEURISM. Retrograde motion of the blood. Important as regards the ligature. frequent than after amputations ? In the former, there is danger of bleeding from two orifices: would it therefore be preferable to apply two ligatures in operations for aneurism ? Or how would a temporary ligature answer? for if an internal clot be formed only on one side of the ligature, and if the vessel is not divided by the ligature, then no bleeding can ensue. Independent of a knowledge of the fact, that hemorrhages take place from the orifice beyond the ligature, whether applied on the cardiac or distal side of an aneurism, the circumstance il- lustrates the change produced in the circulation of the blood when an arterial trunk is obstructed, and points out that it assumes a retrograde mo- tion in the vessel beyond the ligature. This retrograde course of the blood in the portion of an artery between a ligature and the capillary arterial branches which anastamose with its ra- mifications, is a curious pathological fact, the branches of the obstructed vessel thus acquiring a power to transmit the blood in a direction op- posite to its natural course. The circumstance, that there is a retrograde motion in the blood of an artery beyond a liga- ture, for at least a certain period, deserves mature consideration in devising the best means of placing ligatures on vessels, secondary bleeding from the distal being as likely to take place as from the cardiac orifice. Nature employs the same process, that of forming an internal clot to stop the bleed-

OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. 35 a little more than an inch. On examining the upper part of the artery, and replacing the tegu- ments, so as to compare the relative positions of the cicatrix, (where the wound of the operation had been made,) and that of the vessel, both were found to be in exact correspondence; the line of the cicatrix obliquely crossing nearly at its centre, the line of the artery about half an inch below its bifurcation into the external and internal carotids. Intermediately between the cicatrix and the artery, the space was occupied by cellular tissue, con- densed into a mass of apparently a fibrous struc- ture. This substance intimately adhered not only to the artery, but also to the eighth pair of nerves. On slitting open the artery, the dilated portion was much thinner in its wall than the rest of the vessel. The internal surface presented numerous patches, or rather elevated flakes, of a yellow sub- stance, but no cicatrix, or other appearance, could enable us to ascertain the precise point where the ligature had been applied. The carotid was com- pletely pervious, as also were its several branches, with the exception of the superior thyroid, which was filled with a plug of organised lymph. It was also found that the vertebral artery, on the same side, was filled with a similar plug.‚Äù This dissection was conducted by Professor Bennett, of which, he drew up the above account.

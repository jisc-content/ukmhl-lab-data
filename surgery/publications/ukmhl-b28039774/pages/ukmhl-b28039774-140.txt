EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. From the arch of the aorta a is seen arising the left carotid b, and the left subclavian c; the innominata d is left open j at e is the right subclavian j and above it the Aneurismal sac f of the Carotid is laid open, shewing a mass of firm coagulum g, completely filling up the cardiac orifice of the sac, whilst the parietes of the sac itself are much thickened, and lined with laminated coagulated lymph. The two orifices of the artery formed by the ulceration of the ligature are seen at h and j ; the cardiac orifice h being filled with a clot, whilst the distal orifice j is quite pervious. PLATE VI. Fig. 1 is an outline of the Aneurism of the Innominata and roots of the Subclavian and Carotid, described in page 107. The Aneurismal swelling a occupies the'whole of the Inno- minata, a portion of the arch of the aorta b, and the roots of the Carotid c; the Trachea is represented at e, the left Carotid at /, and the left Subclavian at g. Fig. 2 is copied from the Case referred to in page 116, and affords an excellent example of an Aortic Aneurism likely to be mistaken for an Aneurism of the Innominata. The tumor a, of a Florence-flask-form, rises from the aorta between the roots of the left Carotid b and left Subclavian Artery c. PLATE VII. In order still further to point out the obscurities which may render a Diagnosis in Aneurismal Tumors at the root of the neck particularly difficult, I have given in this Plate an outline, from the splendid work of that distinguished Anatomist, Pro- fessor Tiedemann, of the varieties in the origin and distribu- tion of the great arterial trunks arising from the arch of the aorta.

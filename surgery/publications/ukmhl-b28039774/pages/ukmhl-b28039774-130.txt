114 ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA AND Oct. 10, 1810, Becomes anasarcous. Fatal ter- mination. failure about the region of the heart,, accompanied with a tendency to syncope. His feet are still unusually cold, even when the rest of his body is warm. At one point the tumor is thin, projects into a small papilla, situated on the acromial side of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and covered with delicate but not diseased skin. His face is oedematous, and streaked with purple veins; his right hand and arm are cold and ana- sarcous, and the cellular membrane of the lower extremities is loaded with water. He moved slowly, and held his head inclined forward. He spoke in a short and hurried whisper, interrupted every few minutes by a hollow cough, and pro- fuse expectoration of greenish yellow matter. He had no pain; difficulty in breathing and want of sleep were his chief complaints. The aneurism was in no degree enlarged externally, the papilla- like projection had even disappeared, and its coverings were now much thickened; yet it caused more pressure on the trachea: and from the very tremulous motion in the upper part of the thorax, I could not doubt the extension of the disease into the chest. The disease was now drawing to a conclusion; it neither admitted of alleviation or of being cured, and of this the patient was fully aware. He was not therefore disappointed when I informed him that I had no remedy to propose. I left him with directions to send for me if he became worse. In four davs we were called to inspect his body.

4 PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS Aneurisms where situated. Their form and pulsation. ** Bruit de soufflet.” and on examining the preparation, which still exists in his splendid Museum, there is a redness to be perceived in a portion of the coagulum. He states however in the catalogue, that he is doubt- ful whether the red color has been produced from injected vessels, or from effusion of the coloring matter. The internal laminae of the lymph in an aneu- rismal sac are sometimes covered with a coa- gulum of red blood, and at other times, when the process of consolidation of the sides of the sac has been completed, the coagulated mass has a distinct lining membrane which is smooth and polished, and in every respect resembles the lining membrane of a healthy artery. An aneurismal tumor, as may readily be sup- posed, is always found situated along the trajet of an artery. During the first stage its form is more or less rounded, accompanied with no dis- coloration of the skin, and to the touch it feels firm, and has a pulsation synchronous with that of the heart; the pulsations seem to result from dilatation of the sphere of the tumor, and not from any motion of elevation communicated to the mass. A peculiar whizzing sound accompanies this pulsation, which has been distinguished by the French, by the term “ bruit de soiifflet,” from its resemblance to the sound made by a pair of bellows.

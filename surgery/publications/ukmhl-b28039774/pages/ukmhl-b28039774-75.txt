When I first successfully applied a ligature on the distal side of an aneurism, I considered that I had established an important principle in the treatment of those aneurisms in which no ligature could be placed on the cardiac side of the tumor, and, at the same time, no branch intervene be- tween that ligature and the heart. Nearly fifty years had elapsed from the period Neglect of J J J ' r Brasdor’s ope- when this operation was proposed by Brasdor, but ration, in two instances only, excepting in those cases mentioned by me, it had never been performed, either in this country or on the continent of Eu- rope ; and although some writers on aneurism had advocated the principle of such an operation, yet the complete stoppage of the circulation was by all deemed a sine qua non to its success. Suitable cases for the operation, under such circumstances, must have therefore been extremely few; and this From to°i»- .iii i.i mited a view may perhaps be considered the reason why it has of its applica- been so seldom practised. Many eminent sur- 10n’ geons argued not only against the probability of meeting with proper cases, but, as I have already mentioned, even denied the soundness of the prin- ciples on which it was founded.

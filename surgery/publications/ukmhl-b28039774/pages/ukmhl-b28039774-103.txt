TREATED BY TYING THE SUBCLAVIAN. 87 and how far such treatment ought to be adopted in a patient whose case is in other respects hopeless, future experience, and an exact knowledge of the practical application of this principle of operating, can alone determine. I may here observe, that it will perhaps be a matter of no small difficulty to ascertain when one of these arterial trunks is ob- literated, as I have with others been more than once deceived on this point. Conceiving that a want of pulsation was a sufficient indication of the closure of an artery, I formed an erroneous opinion in the case of Mrs. Denmark ; and from the pulsation in the carotid and its branches not See page 67. being perceptible, I supposed that the canal was plugged up; but in a short time after a ligature was placed on the subclavian, I was surprised to find the pulsations of the carotid return, and ulti- mately resume their wonted vigour. It is a fact demonstrated by dissection, and wor- Carotid the thy of remark in contemplating such an operation, S-abbT that when a spontaneous cure of aneurism of the innominata has been going on, nature has first shut up the carotid, so that in performing an ope- ration for the cure of such an aneurism, it surely would be advisable to imitate nature in this res- pect, and to place the first ligature on the carotid, in preference to the subclavian. The advantage of this is obvious, for as no vessels pass from the carotid between the ligature and the sac, a greater diminution in the force of the circulation in the

TREATED BY TYING THE SUBCLAVIAN. 85 direction between the lines of the carotid and subclavian, and thus first appeared in the trian- gular space on the acromial edge of the mastoid muscle. Moreover, when the aneurism is formed in the of aneurism of , . , the subclavian. Subclavian, then wdl the tumor rise on the cer- vical side of the clavicular portion of the mastoid, in the triangular space between that muscle and the trapezius, where, like the former vessels, it is covered only by some fat and condensed cellular membrane. It is indeed in these several spaces where the three different arterial trunks are most exposed, and where the superincumbent parts are of that nature which will most readily yield to the growth of the aneurismal swelling. Another diagnostic mark in distinguishing the Diminished ~ pulsation in seat of the disease of these vessels, is the state oi the branches the pulsation in the branches of the subclavian maUrtery.ns and carotid arteries; the force of the pulse being usually diminished in the branches of a trunk affected with aneurism. Thus when the carotid is the seat of the disease, its branches only will have their pulsation affected ; when the subclavian suffers the radial artery will pulsate with less force; and when the innominata, the circulation in the branches of both subclavian and carotid will be more or less influenced. I may also observe in conclusion, that as the Difficulty of aneurismal tumor acquires considerable bulk, the aneurisms of diagnosis will become more difficult, and the dif-tlie Acuity will, in many cases, arise from the circum- See the plates.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. newly-formed membrane continuous with the lining of the Sac, passing over the mouth of that vessel. This Plate shews the external form of the Aneurism a a a, involving almost the whole length of the Innominata. b is the trunk of the Innominata, c is the Subclavian with its branches ) and d is the Carotid laid open, its sides being compressed by the Aneurism, but its canal remaining pervious, except at its termination in the Sac, where it is completely shut up. PLATE III. Gives an internal view of the Aneurism delineated in the preceeding Plate. The probe a a, is passed along the Innomi- nata, and is seen traversing the Sac and entering the Subclavian Artery. The probe b, is passed along the Carotid Artery, and on its point c is elevated the thin membrane, apparently a continuation of the lining membrane of the Sac, which was formed over the orifice of that vessel, and completely pre- vented any blood passing into it. c c c are the boundary of the Sac, the greater part of which was filled with laminated coa- gulable lymph. The parietes of the Sac contiguous to the traject of the pulse a are thin, and its parietes lined by a polished mem- brane continuous with the internal coat of the vessel. PLATE IV. External appearance of the first case of Carotid Aneurism, described at page 24. PLATE V. Appearances on Dissection of the Carotid Aneurism, Case 3 described at page 45, in which a ligature had been placed on the distal side of the tumor, and where the Aneurismal Sac is seen filled with coagulated lymph,—the portion of artery between the Sac and ligature plugged up,—the Artery ulcerated at the place where the ligature had been applied,—and the distal orifice remaining open, through which the fatal hemor- rhage took place.

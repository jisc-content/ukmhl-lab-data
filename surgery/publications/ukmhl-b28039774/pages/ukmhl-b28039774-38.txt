TREATMENT OK 22 State of the blood when the artery is tied or the cardiac, or distal side of the aneurism. according to the peculiar form or bulk of the swelling. It is also worthy of consideration to compare the difference in the state of the blood contained in an aneurismal tumor when the ligature is placed on the cardiac or on the distal side of the tumor. When on the cardiac side* the blood cannot make its escape, and cannot be pushed through the capillaries into the veins. It must remain in the sac, and must either be absorbed, or be evacu- ated by a process of inflammation and ulceration of the sac. When the ligature is placed on the distal side of the aneurism, as I have already stated, we know from experience, that there is immediately a diminution of the bulk of the tumor. The fluid- blood can find in such case a ready exit into the trunk from whence it came, and thus again passes into the circulation, in place of, as in the other case, having to pass through capillaries into veins, â€”and as nature immediately finds a new channel there is no more blood impelled into the tumor afterwards. In the two first cases of carotid aneurism, where Sir Astley Cooper tied the carotid artery on the cardiac side of the tumor, both the patients died from an increase in its size, which took place after the operation. It would therefore seem that when the ligature is placed on the cardiac side of the tumor, it is not freed of its contents, but a con- gestion takes place of all the blood which may

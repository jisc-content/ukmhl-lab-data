ON ANEURISMS. If the vessel be compressed between the tumor and the heart, the pulsation ceases, and is again renewed when the compression is removed. As an aneurism enlarges, the pulsation of it becomes less and less sensible, and it ultimately communicates but a slight degree of noise when the hand is applied upon the surface. Neither can compression now diminish its volume. The dilatation of an artery usually extends Mode of towards that side where there is the least resist-increa3e* ance made by the contiguous parts. The artery will generally be found to continue to swell, in the direction in which it first began to tumefy, and the distal is found to be dilated more than that portion nearest the heart. Aneurismal tumors are accompanied with a Sensations variety of uneasy sensations, arising from the p^1 them.m" peculiarities of their state as connected with par- ticular nerves, or as being contiguous to particular veins. Where aneurisms advance to their last stage, Modes of ter- they terminate when the tumor adheres to aminatlon* mucous surface either by bursting or sloughing, and they crack or ulcerate when in the serous Bursting, surfaces, such as in the cavity of the pericardium or chest; or they may terminate by what is called a spontaneous cure. It is particularly worthy of attention, in re-Spontaneous ference to the following remarks, that the readercure< should have a correct knowledge of the manner in which the spontaneous cures of aneurism are

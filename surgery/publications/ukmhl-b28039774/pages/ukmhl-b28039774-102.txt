ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA 8(5 New opera- tion in aneu- risms of the Innominata. tVhen to be adopted. One of the branches to be first tied. stance, that two or more of these vessels, and in many instances the arch of the aorta, are in- volved in the disease. It is in cases of aneurism of the Arteria Innomi- nata, wherein I consider the operation of tying one, or both, of the branches of that vessel on the distal side of the tumor, likely to become an ope- ration of great utility, and in an especial manner applicable. In considering the application of this principle of operating in a case of aneurism of the innomi- nata, the first important point of enquiry ought to be, whether blood continues to circulate both through the carotid and the subclavian arteries, or through only one of these divisions of the innominata? I have already stated that there were examples of aneurism of the innominata wherein nature had shut up the carotid, and thus had, in part, accomplished the consolida- tion of the sac. When the aneurism has not attained so great a bulk as either to produce serious affections of the head or of the chest, or to threaten rupture, and when, under such circumstances, both the divi- sions of the innominata remain open, I would then be satisfied with adopting Valsalvaâ€™s system of treatment, in the hope that, ultimately, one of the trunks might be obliterated. Should, however, so favourable a change not ensue, the propriety of tying one of the divi- sions of the innominata is then to be considered;

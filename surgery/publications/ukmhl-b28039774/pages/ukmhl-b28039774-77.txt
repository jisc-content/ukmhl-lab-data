61 THE NEW OPERATION. that the natural or spontaneous process does not effect a cure on the principle of the Hunterian operation by completely arresting1 the passage of the blood into the sac, but is in strict conformity with the principle of the operation I am now en- deavouring to establish,â€”that is, by the formation of a barrier in the artery beyond, or at the distal side of the aneurism. In a case of aneurism of the innominata, Mr. See Appendix. Mackelcan found that nature had nearly com- pleted a cure of the disease on this principle. The carotid artery was plugged up, and the large aneurismal swelling was filled with a coagulum, leaving only a comparatively small channel for the blood to pass into the subclavian artery. I have seen some cases, and several are on record, which illustrate the same important pathological fact, and prove beyond a doubt that blood can coagulate in an aneurism so as to strengthen the parietes of the sac, and ultimately fill its cavity, without the circulation through the sac being in the first instance either suddenly or entirely in- terrupted. It was a knowledge of this fact that led me to New principle perforin the operation I am about to relate. In sug^sted'bj the patient, nature had already instituted a curativethe Author,J process, by diminishing the circulation in the ca- rotid artery, and when I found this alone not suffi- cient to arrest the enlargement of the aneurism, I then determined on placing a ligature on the sub- clavian, and in so doing, conceived that I was

49 OPERATED ON BEYOND THE TUMOR. Fourth Case of Carotid Aneurism “ Mary Covis, aet. 36, in March, 1826, observed a pulsating' tumor about the size of a small hen’s egg, in the upper part of the lower third of the right side of the neck, corresponding to the situa- tion of the carotid artery, which, to the present period, (Sept. 2,1827) has progressively enlarged. A prominent tumor now extends from the clavicle on the right side, upwards to near the os hyoides, se^^TsV. pressing on the trachea, bearing it off to the op- posite side, and passing under the sterno-mas- toid muscle (which is stretched over it) to nearly an inch beyond its outer border. The integu- ments of this side of the neck, particularly in front of the tumor, are thin, shining, and loaded with varicose veins. The tumor is firm at its cir- cumference, but soft in its centre, and by pres- sure its size can be diminished; it pulsates strongly, the throbs being synchronous with those of the left ventricle of the heart. The stethoscope indicates it to be purely aneurismal, and by this instrument the left side of the heart appears to be acting on an increased quantity of blood, with more force than natural.

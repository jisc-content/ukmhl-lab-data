Diagnosis of aneurism of the carotid. Of aneurism of the arteria innominata. See Appendix. 84 ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA and it may be observed that the diagnostic cha- racters about to be pointed out, are chiefly derived from a consideration of the natural position of the vessels, and their relative situation to the surrounding parts. When an aneurismal swelling is formed at the root of the Carotid, the tumefaction will first be perceived in the small triangular space, formed between the heads of the sternal and clavicular portions of the mastoid muscle, and when the tu- mor increases in bulk, it more or less displaces, or sometimes produces the absorption of a portion of either the one or the other of the heads of that muscle. If the aneurismal swelling be formed in the Arteria Innominata, then, in place of its first making its appearance between the two heads of the mastoid muscle, at the bottom of which space lies the carotid artery, covered merely by a loose cellular structure and some fat, the tumor rises up from below the sternum, and on the tracheal edge of the sternal portion of the mas- toid, at which place the innominata is most un- covered. The situation of the tumor, however, varies when the innominata is the seat of the disease, according to the part of the artery that is affected; as in the case of Gordon, where the rupture of the internal coat of the innominata being at the distal extremity of that vessel, and the other coats yielding in the direction of the impetus of the blood, the tumor took a diagonal

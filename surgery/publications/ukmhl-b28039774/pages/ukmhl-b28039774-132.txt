116 ANEURISM OF THE INNOMINATA, &C. Observation of Sir Astley Cooper. His case of aortic aneurism See plate. Mistaken for carotid aneu- rism. inner surface of the aneurismal sac was coated over with many layers of organized lymph, which coating was especially thick and strong about the highest part of the sac. The left part of the arch is of natural size, but a little below the commence- ment of the descending aorta the vessel is again dilated into a small pouch. The sesophagus is pushed completely from behind the trachea. This case corroborates Sir Astley Cooper’s re- mark, that aneurism of the aorta may assume the appearance of being seated in one of the arteries of the neck; an inference drawn from the exami- nation of a case which came under his own ob- servation, and of which he transmitted a short history to me, along with a sketch illustrative of the position of the tumor. In the above case, however, the aneurism was attached to the right side of the aortic arch, and involved a part of the innominata. In Sir Astley Cooper’s, the tumor arose on the left side of the arch of the aorta, from between the roots of the left subclavian and carotid arteries. It formed a Florence-flask-like cyst, the bulbous end of which projected at the root of the neck from behind the sternum, and so nearly resembled aneurism of the root of the ca- rotid artery, that the Surgeon who consulted Sir Astley Cooper actually mistook the disease for carotid aneurism.”* * The Surgical Anatomy of the Head and Neck, by Allan Burns, 1826.

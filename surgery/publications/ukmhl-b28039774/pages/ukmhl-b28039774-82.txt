THE NEW OPERATION. 66 branches. diagram. This may be illustrated by a simple By a diagram. Suppose the pressure of a syringe A to be 6, the impetus given to the fluid in B to be 2, in C to be I, in F to be 1, and in D to be 4. Then if C be obstructed at E, the effect will be, that the whole of the impetus of C, will not be communicated to F alone, but will be diffused in the tubes F and D, in nearly the ratio of the squares of their diameters. Thus, in place of the lost impetus of C passing into F, F will only receive about one-fifth of it, the other four-fifths passing into D.

46 THIRD CASE OF CAROTID ANEURISM Innominata healthy. the appearances observed on dissection. “ Exter- nally in the neck, no tumor was perceptible. More than half of the cicatrix resulting from the operation had ulcerated, leaving a glossy, sloughy- looking ulcer. Upon removing the sternum, the arch of the aorta, through the pericardium, ap- peared to be enlarged; having opened the peri- cardium, there was exposed a thin layer of fibrine, upon the investing portion (said to be common to rheumatic patients). The lungs and heart were perfectly healthy. The descending aorta, two axillary and two internal mammary arteries having been tied, coloured size was injected into the arch of the aorta, and the injection found its way through the wound in the neck. The right common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, nervus vagus, sheath, and surrounding cellular membrane were very firmly united, especially below the wound. Immediately under the lower half of the cicatrix, consequently a little below the external wound, there was ulceration extend- ing through the platysma myoides, to the artery. “ Upon tracing the large vessels upwards from the heart, the arch of the aorta was found to be slightly, but not unusually enlarged; the arteria in- nominata externally, quite natural; when opened, a few small patches of curdy matter were seen under the lining membrane, an appearance com- mon in subjects of this age. The right subcla- vian artery was perfectly healthy. “ At the root of the right common carotid

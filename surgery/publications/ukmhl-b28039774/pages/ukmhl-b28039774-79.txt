This quality of blood is sometimes even essential for the pre- servation of life, as on it depends the process which nature employs in stopping hemorrhages, as well as in curing aneurisms, the languid state in the circulation produced by fainting, admitting the coagulating process of the blood to be effected in the divided vessel, or as it is called, the internal clot to be formed. It ought also to be recollected, that alterations in the blood’s velocity are em- ployed in the animal ceconomy for the perform-

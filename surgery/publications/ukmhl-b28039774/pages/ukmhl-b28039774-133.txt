[ 117 1 Femoral Artery obliterated, and its place sup- plied by one enlarged vessel. The following Dissection was communicated to me by Dr. Wright, and is an additional con- firmation of the important pathological fact to which I have particularly alluded, that although, when a ligature is first placed on an artery nu- merous branches nourish the limb, yet ultimately, that function is performed by only a few or even by one enlarged trunk, and that too nearly in the site of the vessel which has been obliterated. Dissection. “ On examining the inferior extre- mity of a subject in the dissecting-room, of which I knew no previous history, I found that about three inches of the superficial femoral artery was obliterated, being converted into a ligamentous cord, in which there was no trace of the canal. The place of this artery was chiefly supplied by one of the branches of the profunda, the others not being much increased. This branch was equal in size to that of the superficial femoral in the oppo- site extremity, and in the lower part of the thigh had nearly the same course with the remains of the superficial femoral, excepting that it did not pass through the sheath formed for the superficial femoral by the adductor longus and vastus in- termus muscles.” See page FINIS.

15 DRUGS FOR LOCAL ANAESTHESIA other, and yet do not hesitate to express opinions as to their relative value. Marcinowski1 in 1902 published an elaborate article on the use of eucaine in all branches of surgery, and basing his views on his own observations, on the results of experimental observations on animals, and on a study of clinical reports by others, he held that eucaine is undoubtedly much less toxic than cocaine, that it is nearly equal to cocaine in analgesic power, and that, therefore, it should be invariably used in preference to cocaine. His argument was, however, incomplete, for he failed to show that cocaine, though toxic in large doses, can not be safely used when ordinary care is exercised. Barker,2 in reporting a number of operations done under eucaine-adrenalin analgesia, expressed sur- prise that anyone continued to use cocaine in view of the excellent results to be obtained from eucaine. He stated, however, that he had no experience of the use of cocaine, and his condemnation of the drug, which gives excellent results in the hands of others, seemed uncalled for. Soon after the introduction of eucaine, Beclus endeavoured to test the relative value of cocaine and eucaine in a number of precisely similar operations. He concluded that eucaine was rather less powerful as an analgesic than cocaine. Basing his views on Pouchet’s experiments on animals, he held that the drugs were equally toxic. In his use of them clinically he never observed toxic effects from either, and the general conclusion he formed was, that eucaine pre- sented no advantages over cocaine. Although carefully carried out, his comparative observations were few in 1 Marcinowski, “Das Eukain B,”Deutsche Zeitschri/tfur Chirurgic, Leipzig, 1902, Band 65. 2 Barker, British Medical Journal, London, 24th December 1904.

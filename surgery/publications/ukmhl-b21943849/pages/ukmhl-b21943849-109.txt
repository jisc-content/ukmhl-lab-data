Crile,1 in a long series of experiments on animals and by clinical observations on patients, clearly showed the remarkable effects of direct intraneural cocaine injec- tions. He found that injection of £ or 1 per cent, solution of cocaine or eucaine entirely blocked sensory or mixed nerves, preventing the transmission of afferent or efferent impulses, with the result that stimuli, producing pain on the one hand and shock on the other, were not conducted as long as the cocaine or eucaine continued to act. The result of his experi- mental observations encouraged him to use intraneural cocaine injections both for the performance of operations without general anaesthesia altogether and for pre- venting shock in cases of severe operations when general anaesthesia was also used, his view being that shock is caused by stimuli or impressions conveyed along sensory 01 mixed nerve trunks, and that these impressions are freely transmitted when a patient is under the influence of geneial anaesthesia, but not if the nerves supplying the operation area are cocainised before the operation! by cocainising the brachial plexus he was able to amputate at the shoulder joint, by cocainising the sciatic and anterior crural nerves he was able to amputate the leg, and by cocainising the ulnar nerve he was able to operate in the area of its distribution, etc. All these operations were done without inflicting pam, and were not followed by shock, though in some cases the patients were in a very weak condition. He exposed the nerve trunks by infiltrating the overlying tissues with weak cocaine solution and dissecting down reMin(J l° Surgical Options, J. B Ijippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1901. 7

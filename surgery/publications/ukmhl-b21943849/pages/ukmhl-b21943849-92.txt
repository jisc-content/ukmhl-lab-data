Further experience has shown how, by infiltrat- ing the neck of the sac and the tissue round it, the pain of "ligaturing it can be abolished or so much diminished as to"be unimportant. The wound healed by first inten- tion, and the patient was discharged well a few weeks later all the better for her additional rest m bed. Case XXVI.—L.

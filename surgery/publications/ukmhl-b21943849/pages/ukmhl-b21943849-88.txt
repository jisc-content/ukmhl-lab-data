76 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY needle must then be pushed through the external oblique aponeurosis and the solution distributed along the cord, and on either side of it and in it. The best way of gauging exactly the depth to which the needle is to be pushed is to introduce the left index finger into the inguinal canal in front of the cord, and push the needle gently on to it. The syringe should then be held as nearly horizontal as possible, and the needle pushed upwards along the eord and then in other directions so as to distribute the solution along and on either side of the cord and over the edge of the internal oblique. Special attention should be directed to the region round the internal ring where the neck of the sac lies. 3-4 drachms of solution may be injected under the external oblique in this way. A drachm or two of solution may finally be injected beyond the external ring round the sac cord. After waiting the necessary time, which may be devoted to hand washing and arranging instruments, etc., Bassiniâ€™s operation may be done in the usual way. If, after dividing the external oblique over the cord and sac, it is found that the tissues of the cord, especially the upper part, have not been successfully infiltrated, it is well to do this and wait a few minutes for the cocaine to act. Dabbing the solution on tissues which are to be cut is useless ; they must be moderately oedematised to render them anal- gesic. The ilio-inguinal and twigs of the ilio-hypogastric nerve are nearly always seen overlying the coverings of the cord and sac and bathed in solution. They will be found completely analgesic and may be held aside or divided at will. The genital branch of the genito- crural nerve is also frequently met with joining the cord on its under aspect, and if it has not been sur- rounded with solution by the original injection a little

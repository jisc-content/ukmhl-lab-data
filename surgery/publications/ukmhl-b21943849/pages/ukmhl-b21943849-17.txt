5 DRUGS FOR LOCAL ANAESTHESIA than i per cent, of cocaine for subcutaneous injection is quite unnecessary. Solutions containing 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, are still recommended for use by some. Not only are such solutions unnecessarily strong, but they are dangerous, toxic symptoms frequently following their use. All that can be accomplished by the injec- tion of cocaine can be attained by the use of per cent, or weaker solutions, and there can be no doubt that the continued use of stronger solutions has been re- sponsible for many accidents which might have been avoided had the results of using weak solutions been earlier appreciated, and has retarded progress in the use of local anaesthesia, at the same time giving rise to the erroneous idea that cocaine, when used in sufficient quantity to produce a satisfactory anaesthesia, is a dangerous drug. In addition to its power of producing anaesthesia, cocaine acts as a vaso-constrictor. This is of advantage in most surgical procedures, as it tends to make the field of operation bloodless. A certain amount of re- actionary haemorrhage is doubtless liable to take place when the effect of the cocaine wears off, but is so trifling in amount that it may be disregarded, for it is controlled by the pressure exercised by an ordinary dressing and bandage. The local anaesthetic action of cocaine may be intensi- fied by arresting the circulation of the part into which it is injected by means of an elastic tourniquet. Corning appears to have been the first to note this, and Oberst of Halle seems to have been among the first to apply it clinically. He found that if a solution of cocaine was injected round the nerves supplying a digit, and an elastic band was applied simultaneously proximal to the area of injection, to arrest the circula-

94 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY selected, the pain is never severe, and is indeed so trifling that neither patient nor operator is seriously in- convenienced by it. In many cases—and the number increases as experience in making injections is gained— no pain after the initial prick of the injecting needle is felt at all. A hypodermic injection of morphia may be given with advantage before operation to very nervous or excitable patients; as a general rule it is unnecessary and undesirable. Operations on Inflamed Tissues under Local Anaesthesia.—It is sometimes maintained that cocaine injections do not produce anaesthesia in inflamed tissues. This is not correct, for cocaine injections, especially when adrenalin is added to the solution, can make inflamed tissues quite insensitive if one or two pre- cautions are taken. In the first place, the solutions used must be isotonic with the tissue fluids, and in the second place, the injection must be begun outside the inflamed area, must be made slowly, and gradually extended to the inflamed tissues. It will be found that it is more difficult to make the solution travel in inflamed than in normal tissues, and that greater force is therefore necessary to expel the solution from the syringe. Injections begun in inflamed areas generally, cause pain, especially when made quickly. If, on the other hand, the injection is begun in healthy tissue, made slowly, and gradually extended to the inflamed tissues, no pain is caused, the patients merely experi- encing a feeling of distension in the affected area. After-pain is apt to be severe in inflamed tissues, which have been anaesthetised with cocaine injections. As a matter of fact, it is rarely worth while to attempt to induce local anaesthesia by direct infiltration in deal- ing with limited inflammatory or suppurative conditions,

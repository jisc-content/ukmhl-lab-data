8 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY point. Others have maintained that the after-pain is no worse than the wound-pain experienced after opera- tions done under general anaesthesia, and that in many cases it is due to the use of solutions which are not isotonic with the tissue fluids, and which therefore irritate the tissues. As the result of considerable experience, I have come to the conclusion that in many cases there is a considerable degree of after-pain following the use of cocaine and eucaine, and that this is what may be termed a reactionary pain, coming on as it does after the analgesia produced by the drug wears off. It has occurred alike in cases where the cocaine was dissolved in boiled water without the addition of sodium chloride, and in cases where the drug was dissolved in normal saline solution, in cases where adrenalin was and was not used, and in cases where a tourniquet was used to arrest the circulation, and where no tourniquet was used. In cases of in- filtration anaesthesia with solutions of cocaine-adrenalin or eucaine-adrenalin the pain comes on from one to several hours after operation and lasts for five to ten hours. It is usually described by patients as a burning, steady pain. In some few cases it is so severe as to call for the administration of opium to relieve it, but this is fortunately rare. It is, of course, difficult to estimate the severity of pain in individual cases, and it is open to anyone to maintain that what I have termed re- actionary pain is in reality entirely due to the operative procedure and not to any reaction following the use of drugs producing local anaesthesia. Careful observation of patients after such operations as the radical cure of hernia, removal of fatty tumours, prepatellar bursae, varicocele, etc., both under local and general anaesthesia, has convinced me, however, that cocaine and eucaine

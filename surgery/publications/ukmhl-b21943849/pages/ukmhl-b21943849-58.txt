Opinions differ widely as to the extent to which local anaesthesia may legitimately be employed in the interests of the patient. Some patients, though very few, are so con- stituted that a general anaesthetic is necessaiy for almost any operative treatment of them, however trivial. Some operators have neither time nor patience to give local anaesthesia a fair trial, and would restrict its use to cases of trivial importance which may often be done without any anaesthetic at all, general or local. There are, however, a large number of patients who will prefer local anaesthesia if the relative advantages and disadvantages of local and general anaesthesia are fairly put before them, and the object in compiling the following lists of operations suitable for local anaes- thesia is not to show what ought to be done, but what can be done with it, the discomfort and the risk attend- ing the administration of a general anaesthetic being thereby avoided. Each case must be judged on its own merits, and the issues involved vary so much that no

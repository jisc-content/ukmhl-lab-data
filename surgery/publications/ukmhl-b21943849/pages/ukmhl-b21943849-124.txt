112 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY reaching it. In a certain number of cases the palmaris tendon is absent or so small that it cannot be easily de- fined, and in such a case the nerve may be reached with equal certainty by puncturing the skin to the ulnar side of the flexor carpi radialis tendon and pushing the needle for about half an inch obliquely towards the ulna. The ulnar nerve is seen lying behind and to the ulnar side of the artery with its companion veins, and the arrow 2 indicates the line of puncture suggested by Braun for reaching it. Puncture at the elbow, how- ever, is undoubtedly safer and, I believe, more certain, and is therefore to be preferred. The main branch of the radial nerve is seen on the section in the subcutane- ous tissue on the radial aspect of the fore-arm, and the bracket indicates the extent of the subcutaneous band of cocaine solution which should be injected to reach it and the smaller branches of the nerve which are not visible in the section. This band also cuts off the terminal twigs of the musculo-cutaneous nerve which reach the ball of the thumb. By extending this band to the middle of the anterior aspect of the wrist the palmar branch of the median may be reached in cases where it comes off high up, but in most cases it is unnecessary to do this, for the deep injection as de- scribed cuts it off. Lower Limb.â€”At the ankle the posterior tibial nerve may be reached by entering the needle 1 cm. to the inner side of the tendo Achillis, just above the level of the ankle joint, pushing it straight forwards till it strikes the tibia, withdrawing it a little and then in- jecting 1 or J per cent, cocaine-suprarenin solution as for the median or ulnar nerves. There is, according to Braun, little danger of wounding the vessels by this method, but they lie so close to the nerve at this level

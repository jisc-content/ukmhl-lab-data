INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 85 distribute it not only near the outer layer but also near the inner layer, so often erroneously termed the mucous layer. After the injections the whole prepuce looks enormously swollen, but it will be found that a great part of the solution escapes when the incisions are made. In many cases of phimosis in adults, all that is really necessary for relief is a dorsal incision carried back to the corona, and in such cases the solution need only be distributed along and a little way on either side of the middle line. In cases of inflammatory phimosis where the inflammation extends over the whole penis, the injections are apt to cause a good deal of pain, and it is often wise not to attempt to produce local anaes- thesia in such cases. When, however, the inflammation is limited to the prepuce and its immediate neighbour- hood, anaesthesia can be produced without discomfort by entering the needle behind the inflamed area and working forward. The injection, if made slowly and with isotonic solution, causes no pain and produces a satisfactory anaesthesia, as in non-infiammatory cases. Radical Cure of Hydrocele.—In operating on hydrocele an inguinal or scrotal incision can be employed. If it be desired to excise a portion of the skm of the scrotum along with the tunica vaginalis a scrotal incision will of course be made. Otherwise an inguinal incision about lf-2 inches long and reaching to the top of the scrotum is preferable, for the skin in this region is more easily cleansed, the edges of the wound can be more accurately brought together, and dressings can be more easily retained on an inguinal than on a scrotal wound, and therefore primary union is more easily obtained. Winkelmann’s method of slitting and everting the tunica vaginalis and fixing it in this position is simple,

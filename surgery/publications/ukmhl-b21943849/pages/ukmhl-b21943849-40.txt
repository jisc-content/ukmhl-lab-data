28 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY obtained with it, as evidenced by the list of operations which M. Eeclus is in the habit of doing under local analgesia. The list includes almost every operation which can be suitably done under local analgesia, and to avoid unnecessary repetition they will not be enu- merated here, but will be mentioned later when other methods of inducing infiltration analgesia, and their relative advantages, have been described. Before leaving the description of M. Eeclus’ method, however, it must be noted that in his most recent work, since the publication of his book on cocaine, he has been using stovaine instead of cocaine, the strength of the solution used being f per cent. He finds the solution as active as the J per cent, cocaine solution recom- mended in his book, and apparently prefers it on account of the lessened risk of toxic symptoms being produced when very large doses have to be used. He apparently never uses adrenal preparations along with cocaine or stovaine. SchleiclTs Method.—At the time when accidents following the use of strong solutions of cocaine were frequent, Schleich set himself to find out how far solu- tions of cocaine could be diluted without losing their power of inducing analgesia. In his investigation he performed a large number of experiments on himself and others, not only with solutions of cocaine but also with other drugs, with plain water, and saline solutions of varying concentration. His observations were the starting-point of an entirely new departure in the method of inducing infiltration anaesthesia, and although some of his contentions were disputed by subsequent investigators, and have, in fact, been dis- proved, he undoubtedly deserves great credit for having been the first to show that analgesia could be effectively

INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 57 In ten minutes an incision the length of the tumour was made, and it was carefully dissected out. No additional injections were made during the opera- tion, but the whole proceeding was painless. It was found that the connective tissue on the deep aspect of the tumour was only partially infiltrated with solution, and the fact that no pain was felt in dividing it illus- trates the fact that the subcutaneous tissue is, as a rule, almost insensitive, provided that sensory nerves are not met with and stimulated during operation. This patient was very nervous before operation, and just before the incision was made she felt a little faint and shaky. A small dose of brandy was given by the mouth, and she recovered in a few minutes. When she found that the operation was really painless, she lost her nervousness completely. Incidents such as this are liable to occur with nervous and sensitive patients, and are, I believe, sometimes erroneously attributed to the action of cocaine, eucaine, or any drug which is being used. They occur as frequently, I believe, when no anaesthetic is being used at all, and it is well to make patients lie down before any operation, however trivial, to guard against the possibility of syncope occurring. I have seen two other instances of threatened syncope in a long series of operations under local anaesthesia, both in women, and in both cases the symtoms passed off in a few minutes, when the patients found that the operation was, contrary to their expectation, painless and free from discomfort. Enough has been said to show how local anaesthesia may be induced in dealing with tumours, cysts, etc., in- volving the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The cases briefly noted have been selected as typical instances of common lesions which are met with in everyday work.

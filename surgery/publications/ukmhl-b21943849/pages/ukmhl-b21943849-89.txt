INFILTRATION ANESTHESIA OPERATIONS 77 solution should be injected into or on to it, when it quickly becomes insensitive. If the above directions are attended to, Bassini’s operation can be done in every detail without paining the patient. When injections have not been carefully made, the part of the operation most liable to cause pain is ligaturing the neck of the sac, and therefore the suggestion that special attention should be paid to infiltrating it and the tissues round it. Even if this has not been successfully done, the pain caused by the ligature is momentary and slight. Barker suggests that the sac may be cut across and ligatured without dissecting out its peripheral part. This certainly saves time and trouble, and should be done if the sac is long. Leaving the peripheral portion in situ in the scrotum does not interfere with the success of the operation in any way. In dealing with irreducible or strangulated hernie containing bowel, the deeper injections should be made after the parts are exposed, unless the bowel can be certainly avoided in introducing the needle. This entails delay during the operation, but with patience as good results can be got as in operating on reducible hernie. Femoral and Umbilical Hernise. — In dealing with femoral hernise, the tissues over and to the inner side of the sac may be infiltrated before incising. The sac may then be exposed, partly freed, and the tissues to its outer side and below it injected, the femoral vein being then easily avoided with care. Umbilical hernise, as large as a medium-sized orange, may be operated on under local anesthesia by distributing the solution all over the sac and round its neck, going as close to the peritoneum at the neck as is possible without risking

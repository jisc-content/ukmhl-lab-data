drugs for local anaesthesia Paris, 1903. injections are occasionally followed by pain due.to-their use arising from a temporarily increased n iliability oi the’sensory nerve endings in the injection area in associa- tion with the congestion which follows the anaemia m duced by the cocaine-adrenalin mixture. In cases where the circulation has been arrested by a tourniquet reactionary pain is longer in coming on, but is much mo severe and lasts longer than after infiltration anesthesia and is worst when injections have been made m inflamed tissues. The administration of morphia is sometimes called for in such cases to tide the patient over the pain- ful period, which lasts on an average for five to ten hours. General Action of Cocaine-Cocaine Poison- ing —It is sometimes urged against the use of cocaine for inducing local anmstliesia that the risk of its pro- ducing general toxic symptoms is very great. If 1 18 used for subcutaneous injection in solutions stronger than 1 per cent., and especially if it is used m solutions of 5-10 per cent., as is sometimes advised, toxic symptoms are liable to follow. If it is used in dilute solution of 1 in 1000 or thereby, toxic symptoms may also arise if more than 3 grains are injected at one time. The idea that cocaine is a dangerous drug in what- ever way it is used probably depends largely on the numerous accidents which attended its use soon aftei its introduction as a local amesthetic, when its properties were not fully understood and it was used in large doses and concentrated solutions. A number of cases of death from cocaine poisoning have been recorded, and a very large number of cases m which serious toxic, but not fatal, effects followed its use.

32 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY strengths of solutions of sodium chloride. Below is indicated the difference between the freezing-point of each concentration and that of distilled water. The continuous and dotted curves indicate, approximately, the irritation and subsequent paralysis of sensory nerve endings following the production of an endermic wheal with the various concentrations, and it will be seen that the irritation curve rises in close relation to that indicating the subsequent paralysis. The diagram is intended to illustrate the effect of injections in healthy skin, and it will be noted that solutions varying in concentration from '55 per cent, to 2‘5 per cent, produce neither irritation nor analgesia. In inflamed or irritated tissues, however, only isotonic, or very nearly isotonic, solutions are free from irritating properties according to Braun, and he maintains very strongly that only isotonic solutions should be used for injections intended to produce analgesia. He has determined the freezing-point of cocaine solutions of different strengths to determine how much salt should be added to them to make them isotonic, and advises that -8 per cent, sodium chloride be added to the weaker solutions of cocaine and '6 per cent, to the stronger. For practical purposes all requirements are met by using ‘75 per cent, salt solution to dissolve cocaine, encaine, or stovaine for analgesic purposes. The solution which he recommends, corresponding to Schleich’s Ho. 2 solution, is:— Cocaine, -1 gram Sodium chloride, -8 gram. Distilled water, 100 c.c. The cocaine may be replaced, according to Braun, by encaine B without loss of analgesic power if the

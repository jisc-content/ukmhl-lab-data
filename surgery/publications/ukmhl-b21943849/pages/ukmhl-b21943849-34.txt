22 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY specially indicated, and it is therefore unnecessary to discuss it further. Within the last few months two new drugs have been introduced and lauded by their proprietors as powerful local anaesthetics, and as being less toxic than cocaine. These are alypin and novocaine, both manufactured by German firms. As far as they have been tested they appear, like so many other drugs which have been tried and given up, to produce a fairly satisfactory local analgesia, but to be weaker than cocaine, and con- sequently the supposed advantage of their relatively low toxicity disappears, for they have to be used in larger doses and stronger solutions than cocaine. Careful study of what has been written on local anesthesia leaves no doubt that cocaine still remains by far the most useful drug we have for inducing local anesthesia, and also shows beyond reasonable doubt that it is not only satisfactory but safe, when used with ordinary care. Adrenal Preparations.—As noted above, the ad- dition of adrenal preparations in small quantities to solutions of cocaine and eucaine very markedly increases their power of inducing local anaesthesia, and also mark- edly diminishes their liability to produce toxic symtoms. This action is probably entirely due to the marked local ischsemia which follows the injection of adrenalin subcutaneously. This ischsemia interferes with the absorption of the cocaine or eucaine, and therefore local- ises their action. According to Braun’s view the drugs, when finally absorbed into the circulation, are possibly not in their original form, but are broken up or com- bined with other substances, forming in either case relatively innocuous compounds. Therefore, larger doses of cocaine and eucaine are tolerated with than without adrenalin. This action of adrenalin is manifested even

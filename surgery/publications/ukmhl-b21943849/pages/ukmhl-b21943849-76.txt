64 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY rendered analgesic by infiltration with cocaine-adrenalin solution. The solution travels readily and diffuses readily in the loose submucous and muscular tissue of the organ, and the injections are painless except for the initial puncture. Simple tumours such as papil- lomata and fibromata can then be painlessly excised or shelled out, or small malignant ulcers excised with a wide margin of healthy tissue round them. Small portions of doubtful ulcers can also be removed for diagnostic purposes by the same means. The ischaemia produced by adrenalin is usually very marked in the tongue, and when this passes oft there is apt to be a good deal of oozing of blood. This can be guarded against by ligaturing any small vessels or oozing points on the cut surface during operation. Small vessels which are apt to escape notice may some- times be shown up by gently squeezing the infiltrated part of the tongue, when a drop of blood will exude from them and show where a ligature may be applied with advantage. If the part requiring operation occupies a central position, say the tip, the needle should be introduced well behind it, at the side of the tongue, and pushed transversely across the tongue, the solution being injected steadily all the time. Care must be taken to distribute the solution close to the mucous membrane on the upper and also on the under aspect, and to ensure this it is well to nearly withdraw the needle after the first and more central injection, and then push it across again close to the mucous membrane on each aspect of the tongue. In this way an analgesic band is produced behind the area of operation, and working from this the injection should be made to infiltrate the portion of the tongue in front of it. If

CHAPTER V SPINAL ANAESTHESIA By injecting stovaine, cocaine, or eucaine, into the spinal subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture, ames- thesia of the areas supplied by the lower dorsal, lum- bar, and sacral nerves can be produced. Although not actually the first to inject cocaine in this way, Bier was the first who worked out the method and definitely showed its possibilities as a practical method of anaes- thetising the lower extremities. Cocaine was the drug used at first for producing spinal anaesthesia by Bier’s method. £ to \ of a grain dissolved in 1 c.cm. of dis- tilled water was injected through the third or fourth lumbar interspace into the subarachnoid space. In about ten minutes anaesthesia of the lower extremities followed, and lasted long enough for the performance of almost any operation; amputations, excisions of joints, of the rectum, etc., being done under it. Experience soon showed, however, that the method was by no means free from danger, and that in a majority of cases very disagreeable after effects followed the injection of cocaine into the cerebro-spinal fluid, the chief being severe and persistent headache, neuralgic pains in the back and limbs, sickness, and high fever. A number of deaths following the use of spinal anaesthesia weie

23 DRUGS FOR LOCAL ANAESTHESIA when it is used in minute doses and extreme dilutions. For infiltration anaesthesia, for example, a solution containing 1 part of adrenalin chloride to 200 000 produces a marked ischaemia m the area of injection, lasting at least an hour and often much longer. Hie maximum dose of adrenalin which it is advisable to inject varies, like that of cocaine and eucame, with the strength of the solution employed. More than o a milligramme of adrenalin chloride should not be used in any case for injection at one sitting, that is, about 15 drops of the 1 in 1000 solution which is commonly supplied by the manufacturers, and if a quantity, ap- proaching that is used, care should be taken that it is very largely diluted, for otherwise it is apt to cause palpitation and feelings of oppression and precordial distress. It has been shown experimentally1 and confirmed clini- cally that cocaine when mixed with adrenalin inteifeies very little with the vaso-constrictor action of adrenalin, while eucaine considerably lessens its power in this respect. This accounts for the fact that adrenalin, instead of diminishing for practical purposes the differ- ence in anaesthetic power between cocaine and eucaine, increases it, cocaine-adrenalin mixtures being consider- ably more powerful than eucaine-adrenalin mixtures. It is on this account that Braun,2 formerly an enthusi- astic advocate of the use of eucaine for infiltration anaes- thesia, has in his latest work recommended cocaine- suprarenin solutions for regular use and not solutions containing eucaine. There are now a number of preparations of the active principle of the suprarenal gland on the market under 1 Laewen, Deutsche Zdtschri/t fur Chiruryie, 1904, Band / 4, p. 163. 2 H.

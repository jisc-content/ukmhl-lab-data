INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 75 suited than Bassini’s operation for local anaesthesia, and are perhaps best not attempted under it. It must also be emphasised that in using any method, clean and methodical dissection with sharp instruments must be used, and all tearing and blunt dissection avoided, for these latter are apt to drag on tissues outside the anal- gesic area and cause pain. The second objection, that the oedema resulting from the injections complicates the operation, is, I believe, also groundless. The moderate oedema necessary when cocaine-adrenalin solution is used does not really complicate the operation in my experience at all. In fact it has occasionally proved of real service, as the outline of the sac is sometimes distinctly shown up in the oedematised tissues in front of the spermatic cord, and is therefore more easily found than in ordinary cases. Inguinal Hernia, Radical Cure.—In cases of reducible inguinal hernia, or where the sac contains only omentum, the injections may be made as follows. Beginning 1 inch outside the internal abdominal ring the solution should be distributed immediately under the skin along the line of incision as far as the root of the penis in the male and into the labium majus in the female; it should also be distributed laterally to the incision line over an area about 1J inches broad, slightly overlapping Poupart’s ligament below. If the sub- cutaneous fat is very abundant a second series of injections may be made at a deeper level close to the aponeurosis, but in most cases this is unnecessary. Enough solution should be introduced to produce a slight but distinct and uniform swelling over the area covered by the injections. 4-6 drachms of the solution are usually quite sufficient for this purpose.

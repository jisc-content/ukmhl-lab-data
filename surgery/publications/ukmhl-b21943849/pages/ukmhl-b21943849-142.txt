LOCAL ANxESTUES! A 130 IN GENERAL SURGERY cannula is withdrawn ancl the puncture sealed with collodion The patient is then laid Hat on the table foi operations involving the areas of the sacral nerves, i.e. the rectum, perineum, prostate, etc.; for operations on the feet and legs the table is slightly tilted, so that the pelvis is raised and the head lowered ; and fox opei a- tions in the ingxxinal region and lower abdomen the table should be still more tilted. In ten minutes ames- thesia should be complete. It lasts for forty to ninety minutes, sometimes longer. During its development it is important to test where it first appears, for it lasts longest there, and disappears first where it last appears. Donitz recommends that if it appears first in a nerve area below that of the site of operation—e.g. in the feet before the groin, in operating for hernia—the table should be at once further tilted, in the hope that the stovaine may tend to gravitate a little further towards the upper lumbar nerves, and so produce a longer anaes- thesia than would follow in the ordinary course of events. . There are certain points in the technique winch re- quire comment or explanation. A long hollow needle or cannula without a trocar may be used perfectly well for the injections. The use of a trocar or stylet in the cannula for puncturing the skin alone appears to present no real advantage. The needle and syringe must, of course, be sterilised, and, as in using cocaine and eucaine, they must not be sterilised in soda solution, but in plain water or in physiological salt solution. Till recently lumbar puncture was generally done by entering the needle a centimetre to one side of the middle line and guiding it obliquely so that the point lay approximately in the middle line when it pierced the dura mater. t is obviously easier to puncture the dura in or very neai

131 SPINA L A NABS THESI A the middle line if the needle is entered in the middle line and pushed straight on. The idea that the needle meets with less resistance and is more easily guided if entered to one side is apparently erroneous, or has had too much importance attached to it. The importance of piercing the dura exactly in the middle line is, ac- cording to Donitz, that by so doing its point enters a small space between the two halves of the cauda equina and lies free in the cerebro-spinal fluid. Hence the fluid readily escapes in a jet, and the injected solution will distribute itself evenly over the nerve roots on both sides. If, on the other hand, the needle pierces the dura a little to one side, it is apt to get entangled among the nerve roots on that side; hence the flow of cerebro- spinal fluid may be partially obstructed by nerve roots impinging on the end of the needle, and the injected stovaine is apt to be distributed chiefly on one side, producing a unilateral or asymmetrical anaesthesia. It will be noted that Donitz recommends that the injection be made in the first or second lumbar interspace. Many surgeons who make use of spinal anaesthesia make the injection at a lower level. Thus Chaput recommends that the injection be made either immediately above or below the fourth lumbar spine, i.e. in the third or fourth interspace. For operations involving the area of dis- tribution of the upper lumbar and lower dorsal nerves, he advises the use of larger doses of stovaine than for operations on the lower lumbar and sacral nerve areas the maximum dose he uses being 8 centigrammes of stovaine. He uses a 10 per cent, solution of stovaine mixed with sodium chloride in equal proportion, the object of the sodium chloride addition being to prevent or limit a possible precipitation of the stovaine by the alkaline cerebro-spinal fluid. It certainly seems rational

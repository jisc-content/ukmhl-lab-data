39 INFILTRATION ANESTHESIA thoroughly tested before purchase, and any which allows the slightest leakage should be rejected. It is surpris- ing how much pressure is required to infiltrate dense tissues, and satisfactory results can only be got with a syringe which works perfectly. Some prefer glass syringes because the solution can be seen in them and its escape watched. The eye should watch the effect of the injection as it enters the tissues, not the solution as it leaves the syringe. Glass syringes are more easily broken, and often more costly than metal ones. There are many good patterns on the market: one of the best is the syringe known as the “ Record.” It can easily be modified to take the seamless steel tubing needles recommended above. In fig. 2 is indicated a convenient outfit for local anaesthesia. It consists of a small metal tray on which are fitted clips for a large and small syringe, for two glasses, each holding 2 ounces of fluid, graduated in drachms and cubic centimetres, for a glass rod to stir the solutions, and a spiral spring to take needles of various sizes. The tray fits into a small metal steriliser and the whole can be boiled before use. The clips are con- venient for holding glasses, etc., firmly in position, so that the steriliser and contents may be carried in a bag without fear of breakages and damage to needle points. The syringe and needles, as also the glass measure for preparing the solutions, must be sterilised in plain water or saline solution and not in soda solution, for soda breaks up the cocaine or eucaine and destroys their analgesic properties. As steel needles are apt to rust a little during boiling they must be carefully wiped and washed through with sterile lotion, prefer- ably carbolic, before use.

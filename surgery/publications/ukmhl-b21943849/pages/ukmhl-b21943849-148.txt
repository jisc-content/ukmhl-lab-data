136 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY latter is said to be of advantage, because the after effects are, as a rule, much less unpleasant for the patient. Against this must be put the fact that it is undoubtedly unpleasant and often probably harmful for the patient to be conscious while a major operation is being per- formed, while there is always a risk, although admittedly a remote one, that an infective meningitis may be caused by the lumbar puncture. For minor operations, which can be done under local amesthesia, the use of spinal as of general amesthesia seems unnecessary and therefore unjustifiable. In cases where. a general anaesthetic is contra-indicated, as in advanced cardiac disease, etc., in cases where an operator has to work single-handed, and possibly in military surgery and on board ship, spinal anaesthesia seems to possess undoubted advantages. Till, however, it has been definitely shown to be safer than general anaesthesia, its employment as a matter of routine is not to be recommended. PRINTED BY NEILL AND 00., LTD., EDINBURGH.

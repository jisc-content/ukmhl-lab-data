58 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY They will serve to show what can be done in such con- ditions with local anaesthesia. General anaesthetics are often administered in similar cases, but their use is, 1 believe, rarely necessary or justifiable. Operations on Vessels, Tendons, Bursae, etc. Ligature of arteries. Ligature or excision of varicose veins. Tendon suture : tenotomy. Excision of ganglia. Removal of enlarged bursae, etc. The ligature of an artery as a set operation is com- paratively seldom done nowadays. Still such operations are by no means unknown, and certain arteries which lie near the skin can easily be tied under local anaes- thesia. Such are the common carotid immediately below its bifurcation, the subclavian in its third part, the brachial artery in any part of its course, the radial and ulnar in their lower thirds, the common or superfi- cial femoral in Hunter’s canal, etc., etc. Any artery, in fact, which lies near the surface and does not require a difficult or complicated dissection to expose it, can quite well be tied without paining the patient by infiltrating the superficial tissues over and alongside it. When a sensory or mixed nerve lies over or beside the artery, it can be cocainised directly, with i per cent, cocaine, when it is exposed. Ligature or Excision of Varicose Veins.— Varicose veins may conveniently be rendered prominent before making injections near them by applying an elastic bandage round the leg or thigh, just above the dilated veins. Injections can then be made without fear of the needle entering a large vein. Solution

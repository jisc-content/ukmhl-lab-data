18 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY using drugs producing local analgesia. Even had the drugs been equally toxic, eucaine would probably never have acquired the evil reputation which cocaine acquired owing to its indiscriminate and careless use, and would probably have been regarded as a less dangerous drug. The fact, however, that eucaine is habitually used without ill effect in doses which would be dangerous in the case of cocaine, proves it to be the less toxic drug of the two. As was pointed out earlier, however, there are limits within which cocaine may be used with complete safety. It will be found that the great majority of operations suitable for local anaes- thesia may be done with doses of cocaine within these limits, and, therefore, it seems to me that the preference should only be given to the weaker drug for the few operations in which very large quantities of solution are required. The dose of eucaine beyond which it is unwise to go when combined with adrenalin may be stated at l|-2 grains in J per cent, solution, and 6 grains in 1 in 1000 solution. The properties and relative value of the two drugs for local anaesthesia may be summed up as follows:â€” Both drugs act powerfully as local analgesics. Cocaine acts as a vaso-constrictor: eucaine as a vaso-dilator. For intraneural injection they give equal results. Co- caine diffuses among the tissues more readily than eucaine, and is therefore preferable for perineural in- jection and infiltration anaesthesia, acting more surely and more quickly than eucaine. Cocaine is more toxic than eucaine, and should not be used in doses of more than 1 grain in ^ per cent, solution or 2 grains in 1 in 1000 solution when combined with adrenalin, while eucaine may be used in doses of 2-6 grains in corresponding solutions. Eucaine should

54 LOCAL A NAES 1 'HE SI A IN GENERAL SURGERY 3 ounces of cocaine-adrenalin solution = 1£ grains of cocaine were injected subcutaneously close to the skin on the left thigh. The solution was distributed over an area about 6x6 inches. Ten minutes after the injection was finished Thiersch grafts were painlessly removed from the whole area reached by the injection. The grafts were transferred directly to the surface of the ulcer, which had been previously freshened by rubbing with a dry gauze swab. Some took and some died. A general anaesthetic need never be given for the removal of Thiersch grafts unless the area to be covered is so large that a dangerous dose of cocaine or eucaine would be necessary to render it analgesic. Removal of Warts, Epitheliomata, Ulcers, etc.—In removing warts, epitheliomata, ulcers, etc., the injection should be introduced so as to make a subcutaneous ring of it all round the object to be removed, broad enough to extend beyond the limits of the proposed incision. The needle should then be passed under the tumour or ulcer and the solution distributed carefully under it, so as to cut off the nerve supply to the area of skin from which it is derived. The final result is that the epithelioma or ulcer is raised on a bed of solution and surrounded by it. With small rodent ulcers and warts this may generally be effected from one puncture by pushing the needle in various directions, but in cases where a considerable area is involved several punctures may be required. Additional punctures should always be made just within the area covered by injection from a previous one. Case VIII.—Mrs B., ait. 51 years, suffering from a rodent ulcer about £ X { inch on the right cheek just beside the ala of the nose.

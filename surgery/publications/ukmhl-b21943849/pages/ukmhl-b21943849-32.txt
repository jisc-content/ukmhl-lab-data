20 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY In a discussion at the Societe de Chirurgie in 1904, Delbet1 expressed the opinion that its analgesic power was less than that of cocaine. Tuffier, who used the drug for inducing spinal anaesthesia, said he had formed the impression that the anaesthetic zone was less extensive and the analgesia less profound, but that the after effects were much less unpleasant than with cocaine. Chaput,2 who had used stovaine in 150 cases of spinal anaesthesia, expressed complete satisfaction with the results. Bier,3 at the German Surgical Con- gress in 1905, expressed himself as entirely satisfied with the results of the use of stovaine for inducing spinal anaesthesia, and maintained that it was by far the best drug for the purpose. He recommended that it should be combined with paranephrin. Czerny expressed similar opinions. Braun tested stovaine in experiments on himself and others, and concluded that it was weaker in analgesic power than cocaine, and that it presented no advantages whatever as a local anaesthetic (excluding its use for spinal analgesia) over cocaine, eucaine, or tropa-eocaine. On examining these .reports, one is struck by the fact that the reports on the use of stovaine for infiltration and regional an- aesthesia are too few to enable a positive opinion on its value to be formed, and one notes the suggestion by some observers that its analgesic power is less than that of cocaine. Reports on its value in inducing spinal anaesthesia are numerous and definite enough to show that it is the best drug for that purpose. It must be noted, however, that the dose necessary for inducing 1 Revue de Chirurgie, Paris, 1904, vol. xxx. p. S03. 2 Ibid. ;!

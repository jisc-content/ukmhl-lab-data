134 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY the mixture isotonic with the cerebro-spinal fluid, are prepared by Billon, Paris, who also prepares capsules containing stovaine and sodium chloride without adrenal substance, as used by French surgeons.1 The addition of adrenal substance is recommended by Bier, as it pro- longs the anaesthesia, and its use seems therefore to be undoubtedly advisable. The maximum dose, according to Donitz, should not exceed 6 centigrammes of stovaine, i.e. i\ c.cm. of 4 per cent, solution, while French writers state that as much as 8 centigrammes may be safely injected when a high anaesthesia is necessary. The duration of the anaesthesia, as already mentioned, is as a rule forty to ninety minutes, sometimes longer, especially when epine- phran or other adrenal preparation is injected along with the stovaine. This allows of the performance of almost any operation in the area of distribution of the affected nerve roots. Complications during the anaesthesia are not often observed when stovaine is used, biit are not unknown. Cases of collapse have been recorded, and the occurrence of nausea and vomiting has also been noted. Motor paralysis frequently occurs along with the sensory paralysis, but passes off before or along with the sensory. Unpleasant after effects similar to those produced by cocaine, but of less intensity, occiu in a certain proportion of cases, especially when a large dose has been used. The number of cases in which they occur is difficult to estimate from the lecoids already published, but appears to be 15 to 20 pei cent, of all cases. Unilateral or incomplete or total absence of anaesthesia after injections is met with occasionally, 1 These are to be obtained in this country from Jos.

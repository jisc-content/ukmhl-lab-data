86 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY but is sometimes followed by recurrence, and is less certain than the plan of cutting away the parietal layer of the tunica as far as its reflection on to the epididymis and testis. The latter plan is therefore recommended, and may be carried out as follows:â€” Infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue along the line of incision close to the skin. Then pass the needle more deeply on to the cord, and distribute some solution round and into it. Next distribute a layer of solution under the skin of the scrotum all over the hydrocele, beginning at the upper end and working down and round it. In ten minutes push the hydrocele gently up towards the groin, when it will be found to bulge the skin along the incision line. Incise the skin and cut through the subcutaneous tissue, etc., till the bluish semi-translucent tunica vaginalis appears. Push the hydrocele firmly up and puncture it, when the fluid will escape in a jet and may be collected in a vessel held near the wound. When the sac is empty, seize the cut edges and pull on them, when it will be found easy to dissect the tunica from its coverings, and pull it with the testis out of the wound. Cut away the parietal layer close to its reflection, tie all bleeding points and return the testis to the scrotum. It is of great importance to tie every bleeding or oozing point in this operation; effective pressure cannot be applied to the scrotum, and a troublesome luematoma is apt to form if any bleeding takes place after the operation. The whole operation can be carried out quite painlessly. The testis must, of course, be handled gently and all tearing and pulling avoided, but with these precautions excellent results may be obtained. If a scrotal incision be made no infiltration of the inguinal region is required, but special attention must be directed to the legion of

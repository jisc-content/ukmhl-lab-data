12 local anaesthesia in general surgery action, should never be administered, as it has been shown to be harmful rather than useful in cases of cocaine poisoning. Tn very severe cases, artificial respiration has to be employed and kept up for some time. It must be understood that the foregoing remarks on the toxicity of cocaine refer to its use for inducing anaesthesia by subcutaneous injection, and not for inducing spinal anaesthesia by lumbar puncture. Although it can be used for spinal anaesthesia with- out danger to life when combined with adrenalin, it often causes toxic symptoms and very often disagree- able after effects, and its use should therefore be entirely given up, and stovaine, which has proved much less objectional for this special purpose, used in its place. Dose of Cocaine.—No statement of the dose of cocaine which does not indicate the strength of solution to be employed is complete. Eeclus, Schleich, Braun, Pouchet, and others have shown clinically and experi- mentally that much larger quantities of cocaine may be safely injected in dilute than in strong solution. Eeclus goes so far as to say that while 10 centigrammes (1J grains approx.) of cocaine should be the limit in 1 pei cent, solution, 20 centigrammes may be safely used in £ per cent, solution. Braun states that while the limit of 5 centigrammes should not be passed in using 1 per cent, solution, twice that amount may be safely used when the solution is as weak as 1 in 1000. Schleich puts the maximum dose of cocaine in 1 in 1000 solution at 5 centigrammes, although he suggests that that dose may be safely exceeded, as a good deal of the injected solution escapes when the incision into the oedematised tissues is made. Schleich’s recommendation certainly

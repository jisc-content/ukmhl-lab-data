119 REGIONAL A NMBTHKAIA tissues feel dead and that the operation is quite painless. I have not been able to demonstrate a motor paralysis in any of my cases, and this is in accord with the general experience that sensory fibres in a nerve are much more easily affected and paralysed than motor fibres. Owing to the fact that sometimes only analgesia and not complete anaesthesia is produced by the injec- tions, it is well not to ask patients whether they fed a pinch or a needle prick before beginning to operate. A better plan is to take a needle and, without allowing the patient to see what is being done, to pass it deeply into the operation area. If any response is made by the patient a question as to whether pain was felt or not may be asked: if no response is made the operation may be begun without any questions being asked at all. The long interval which must be allowed for the injec- tions to act is undoubtedly a drawback if only one patient is being dealt with at a time. In such a case it is well to make the injections before the other preparations for the operation, and then the waiting interval may be spent in making all the other prepara- tions, such as sterilising and arranging instruments, cleansing the skin at the site of operation, arranging sterilised towels, etc. In hospital work the injections may be made and the patient allowed to lie on a couch or table for twenty minutes or longer while other patients are being seen. In this way no time is lost at all, and the induction of anaesthesia is much simpler and less troublesome than when a general anaesthetic has to be given. In the foregoing pages a short description has been given of what appear to be the most practical of Braunâ€™s methods. For a detailed description of these, and of other perhaps less important but interesting

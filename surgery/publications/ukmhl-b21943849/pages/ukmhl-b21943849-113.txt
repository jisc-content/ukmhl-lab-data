Braun’s observations are certainly of great interest, and although his methods have not yet been at all widely made use of, it is probable that when further experience has been gained, his method of anaesthetising limited parts of the body by perineural injections will be proved to be of real practical value. Oberst’s Regional Anaesthesia for Fingers and Toes. By this method any digit can be made abso- lutely anaesthetic, and any operation on it, from a simple skin incision to an amputation, painlessly carried out.

The skin at the base of the finger or toe is pinched up from the side to make it taut, and the needle passed into the subcutaneous tissue with a sharp stab, on the dorsal aspect just to one side of the phalanx.

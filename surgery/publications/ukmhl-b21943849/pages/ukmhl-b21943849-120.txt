108 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY 1 Holscher, Munchener mcdicinisehe Wochenschri/t, 1899, No. 8. A large number of cases illustrating the use of Oberst’s method might be cited, but it is perhaps enough to say, that in a large experience of its use, in all classes of patients, 1 have never known it to fail, or to produce any bad results, except the occurrence of severe reactionary pain, when the tourniquet has been too tightly applied. I have frequently used it in children, generally using eucaine instead of cocaine, and have found it most useful for them, as well as for adults. After the slight pain caused by prick of the fine sharp needle passes off, most children tolerate the subsequent operation as well as adults. The youngest child I have used Oberst’s method on was a little girl aged four, who came to hospital suffering from a neglected whitlow with necrosis of the terminal phalanx of the middle finger. After the injections had been made, she was laid on a table, and her face partly covered with a towel. The suppurating area was opened up, the terminal phalanx excised, and the whole wound thoroughly cleansed, and a dressing applied. On re- moving the towel from the child’s face, it was found that she had gone fast asleep during the operation, a good proof of the efficacy of the anaesthesia! Braun’s Method of Inducing Regional Anaes- thesia by Cocaine-Suprarenin Injections. Numerous attempts were made to extend the use of perineural cocaine injections beyond the fingers and toes, to the hand, and arm, and foot, and leg, after Oberst’s method became known, and from time to time successful cases were reported. Holscher1 reported in 1899 some cases where he had extended the use of

98 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY to the nerves, and then injected enough 1 or \ per cent, cocaine solution directly into the exposed nerves to make a small fusiform swelling on each. Anaesthesia followed almost immediately, and lasted for half an hour or thereby. His results were certainly of great interest as showing that nerves could he completely and almost instantaneously paralysed by intraneural cocaine injec- tions. It is doubtful, however, whether they are really of far-reaching importance. The injection of nerves supplying a whole limb, upper or lower, is a complicated process, especially when it has to he done under local anaesthesia through a wound other than that necessaiy for the operative treatment of the condition present. That shock may be to some extent prevented by it may be granted, that it may be altogether prevented is doubtful, for the action of the cocaine is brief, and just as wound pain is felt after its effect wears off, so the altered conditions of the circulation and other effects produced by removal of a whole or part of a limb will almost certainly cause a certain degree of shock when the action of the drug is past. In major amputations in the upper limb, his method may have an application in the rare cases where general anaesthesia is absolutely contra-indicated. For major amputations of or through the lower limb, spinal anaesthesia with stovaine, or stovaine-adrenalin, is undoubtedly simpler and more suitable, if it is thought desirable to avoid a general anaesthetic. Braun1 has made a number of clinical observations on the perineural injection of cocaine-suprarenin solu- tions round nerves which can be accurately located from the surface and easily reached by the injecting needle without risk of damaging important vessels.

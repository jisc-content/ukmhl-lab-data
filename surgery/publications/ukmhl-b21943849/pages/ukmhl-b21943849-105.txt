INFILTRATION ANESTHESIA OPERATIONS !J3 9 drachms of cocaine-adrenalin solution were injected round the fistulous track and between it and the anus. In eight minutes a finger was passed into the rectum and a probe into the fistula; no internal opening was present, but the probe was made to enter the canal where the mucous membrane was thinnest. The fistula was then laid open into the anal canal. The wall, which was hard and fibrous, was vigorously scraped with a spoon and swabbed with pure phenol, and the cavity packed with iodoform gauze. The operation was absolutely painless. Fissures of the anus can be dealt with on similar lines. It will be noted that simple cases of haemorrhoids, fistula, and fissure are recommended as suitable for operation under local anaesthesia. Cases with much inflammatory thickening, or where the extent of the operation cannot readily be ascertained before begin- ning to operate, should not be dealt with under local anaesthesia unless, indeed, general anaesthesia is definitely contra-indicated. The foregoing lists of operations which may be done under local anaesthesia are not meant to be exhaustive; many similar conditions might be named which may be suitably treated with its help. The operations named and the cases briefly referred to, however, will it is hoped show fairly well the possibilities attending the use of infiltration anaesethesia. It will be remarked that in some cases slight pain is noted as having occurred during the operations, that in other cases a hypodermic injection of morphia was given ten or twenty minutes before making the injections of cocaine. That slight pain is and must be occasionally felt is freely admitted, but, on the other hand, if injections are carefully made and suitable cases for local anaesthesia

113 REGION A L A NAESTHE8IA that there would certainly appear to be some risk of injecting the cocaine directly into one of the venae comites or the artery. The anterior tibial nerve may be reached three lingersâ€™ breadths above the internal malleolus by entering the needle to the outer side of the tibialis anticus, between it and the extensor longus hallucis, pushing it down to the bone and then, after withdrawing it a little, pushing it under the extensor hallucis tendon and injecting the solution there. The other nerves reaching the foot, running as they do in the subcutaneous tissue, may all be reached by injecting a ring of 1 in 500 cocaine-suprarenin solution in the subcutaneous tissue just above the malleolus intern us. It sometimes takes twenty to twenty-five minutes be- fore the anaesthesia produced by perineural injections is complete. The effect of the injections may be intensified and hastened if a broad rubber band is applied to the arm, leg, or thigh, to produce venous congestion immediately after injecting. Such a band causes no pain, whereas one applied to completely arrest the circulation is apt to be painful, especially if left on for long. It is always well to apply this congesting band during the time re- quired for the cocaine to take effect. It must, of course, be removed before beginning to operate, and may, when absolutely necessary for operative purposes, be replaced by one completely arresting the circulation. From the above descriptions it will be seen that Braun has devised methods of anaesthetising the hand and foot, in part or altogether, by means of cocaine-suprarenin injections. Thus the radial half of the hand may be anaesthetised by injecting round the median and radial nerves at the wrist. The ulnar distribution may be anaesthetised by injecting the nerve at the wrist, or 8

117 REGIONAL ANESTHESIA nerve. The needle was entered immediately to the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon, 1 inch above the lowest skin crease at the wrist, and pushed obliquely towards the radius for about i an inch. The solution was then injected slowly, the point of the needle being moved about a little during -the injection, which was also continued while withdrawing the needle from under the deep fascia. 40 minims of the same solution were then injected in the subcutaneous tissue across the front of the wrist from the radial border to the middle, to catch the palmar cutaneous twigs of the median nerve. Venous congestion was then induced by the rubber band. Half an hour later the congesting band was removed, and replaced by one arresting the circulation at the wrist. The incision was then made into the thenar eminence, and after some searching the piece of needle, J an inch long, was found em- bedded in the flexor brevis pollicis and removed. The operation was absolutely painless. There was no after pain, and the wound healed by first intention. Case XL.—A. N., male, cet. 43 years. Amputation of the patient’s index finger was required for old-standing suppuration destroying the tendons and first phalanx of the finger. 30 drops of cocaine-suprarenin solution were injected round the median nerve as in the previous case. 60-70 drops were then injected in the sub- cutaneous tissue at the same level, from just outside the radial artery to the middle of the dorsal aspect of the wrist, to catch the branches of the radial nerve No congesting band was applied. In thirty minutes the index finger was amputated without causing the patient the least pain. Case XLI.—Crush of hand with comminuted com- pound fracture of little finger, severe lacerated wound

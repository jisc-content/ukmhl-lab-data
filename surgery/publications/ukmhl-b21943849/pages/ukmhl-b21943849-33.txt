DRUGS FUR LOCAL ANAESTHESIA 21 spinal anaesthesia is larger than the dose of cocaine which sufficed for that purpose, a fact which suppoits the view that stovaine is less powerful than cocaine. Very few reports have yet appeared to show whether stovaine and adrenalin may be suitably combined 01 not for ordinary purposes, though Bier advises the combination for spinal anaesthesia. Further experience will show whether stovaine can displace cocaine and eucaine to any extent for infiltration and regional anaesthesia. It seems unlikely that any drug will be found to have a powerful enough action on nerve trunks and endings to produce a satisfactory local anaesthesia, which will not also have a markedly toxic action on the central nervous system when absorbed into the general circulation in any quantity. It is to be hoped that those who use stovaine for in- filtration or regional anaesthesia will report their results fully, in order that its real value may be determined. In the meantime, cocaine and eucaine may be commended to those who prefer not to experiment, as satisfactory drugs for regional and infiltration an- aesthesia, while stovaine may with advantage be preferred for spinal anaesthesia. Tropa-cocaine, a drug closely allied to cocaine, derived from the leaves of the Java coca plant, has been much used for inducing local anaesthesia, especially in Germany. It appears to be intermediate in strength and toxicity between cocaine and eucaine, and possesses no advantages which make it preferable to these drugs. It has one decided disadvantage, namely, that it appears to neutralise the action of adrenalin when combined with it, and therefore its analgesic power cannot be increased by using that drug along with it. There are no circumstances under which tropa-cocaine seems

14 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY soon found that only eucaine B was suitable for induc- ing local anesthesia, the A preparation being found irritating and unsatisfactory. Eucaine B is accord- ingly the only form now in use. The hydrochlorate and the lactate are both used for medicinal purposes. The hydrochlorate is soluble in water or saline solution at room temperature to the extent of 3^-4 per cent., while the lactate is soluble to the extent of 29 per cent. Of the two salts, the lactate therefore seems undoubtedly the more convenient for general use, on account of its greater solubility. It occurs as a white non-hygroscopic powder, melting at 155Â° C. Its solu- tions are stable, and can be sterilised repeatedly by boiling without change. The properties of eucaine are similar to those of cocaine, with this exception, that it produces a slight vaso-dilatation instead of a vaso-constriction when injected subcutaneously or applied to mucous mem- branes. It is claimed by some that the local anaesthetic power of eucaine is equal to that of cocaine, while its general toxicity is very much less. It is exceedingly difficult to estimate accurately the relative value of the two drugs in these respects. Experimental observa- tions on animals are, of course, useless in estimating their analgesic properties, and the value of experiments on animals is at the best doubtful in estimating the toxic action of the drugs on the human subject, for human beings and animals such as rabbits oi guinea- pigs, may react in a very different manner to diugs which exert their action chiefly on the central nervous system. It seems to me that the only true test is that of clinical experience, and when we turn to the records of those who use local anesthesia extensively, we find that many have used one drug to the exclusion of the

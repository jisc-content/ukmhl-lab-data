123 REGIONAL ANAESTHESIA minims of L per cent, cocaine-adrenalin solution were injected round each nerve supplying the finger, the injections being made in healthy tissue just proximal to the inflamed area on the hand. J per cent, eucaine- adrenalin solution was then used to infiltrate the in- flamed tissues at the site of amputation. The injection was begun just outside the inflamed area and gradually extended into it, and caused no pain. 5 drachms of eucaine solution were used altogether. A tourniquet arresting the circulation was then applied at the wrist, and eighteen minutes later the finger was disarticulated at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint without causing the patient any pain whatever. Four hours later after- pain came on and was severe. It lasted through the night following the operation and then subsided. Case XLIII.â€”A. B., male, cet. 50 years. The patient was first seen four weeks after the onset of a severe tendon sheath whitlow of the left index finger. After treatment by free incision, drainage, and antiseptic dressing, the acute inflammation subsided, but left a useless finger, without tendons and with stiff joints, and amputation was therefore done. \ per cent, cocaine- adrenalin solution was injected from the palm and dorsum of the hand round the nerves running to supply the finger, proximal to the inflamed area. 1 in 900 cocaine-adrenalin solution was then used to infiltrate the tissues round the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, the injection being begun as before in healthy tissue. ' The injection was painless, but, owing to the density of the tissues, was difficult to make. A tourniquet was applied at the wrist. Twenty minutes later the finder was removed without the least pain being felt. Five horns after operation after-pain came on and was severe, lasting through the night following the operation.

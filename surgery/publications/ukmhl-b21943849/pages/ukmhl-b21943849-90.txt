78 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY puncture of any contained bowel. Supplementary injections may be made, especially at the neck of the sac after it is exposed. Case XXIII.—X. Y., male, cet. 55 years, suffering from a recurrence of a right scrotal hernia, which had been operated on seven years before under chloroform. The patient had weak abdominal walls and was not a good subject, but he was very anxious to have an attempt made to cure his hernia. The operation was done under local anaesthesia. Cocaine-adrenalin solution was injected as described above. After ten minutes’ waiting the incision was made, and the sac exposed and isolated in its upper part. It was then cut across at the top of the scrotum, the neck ligatured and dropped back. The scrotal portion was left in situ. As the result of the scar formation following the first operation the lower edges of the internal oblique and transversalis had become fibrous. The fibrous edges were stitched to Poupart’s ligament with chromic catgut. The external oblique was then united over the cord and the wound closed without drainage. The patient said when ques- tioned that he had felt one or two “jags” during the operation, but they were not worth mentioning. After- pain came on an hour or two after the operation, but was slight, and the patient said that he thought it was less than that following the first operation.

In twenty minutes incision was made down to the external oblique,

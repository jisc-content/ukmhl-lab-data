IN FI I TEA TION ANESTHESIA 35 dulous tumours, such as haemorrhoids, fibromas, sar- comas, become often ten times their former size. The skin over such tissues becomes like silky paper and al- most transparent like glass. The tough elastic cutis naturally opposes considerable resistance to this dis- tension, but even with it a sufficient oedema is much more intense than that seen in pathological conditions.” In inducing analgesia bySchleich’s method, it is well to bear in mind that the tissues must be distended to their utmost to produce analgesia, and that only oedematised tissue is analgesic. Tissues in which incision is to be made must be completely oedematised, and only the tissue to be incised must be oedematised. If these points are attended to, very satisfactory results can be obtained with Schleich’s method. Infiltration with Cocaine - Adrenalin or Eucaine - Adrenalin Mixtures.— Although satis- factory results can be got by using either of the methods described above, both leave a good deal to be desired in several respects. With Eeclus’ method extreme care and precision in making injections is necessary, and even the maximum dose of cocaine which he uses, large as it is, barely allows of the distribution of the solution over the whole field of many operations. Especially is this the case when, as so often happens, incision leveals a state of affairs more complicated than was expected at the beginning of an operation. Schleich’s method, on the other hand, is a little unsatis- factory because of the difficulty of completely infiltrat- ing every portion of an operation field, and because the extreme oedema necessary is apt to obscure anatomical details and render dissection difficult and tedious. The discovery of the properties of adrenalin-cocaine or adrenalin-eucaine mixtures has allowed of important

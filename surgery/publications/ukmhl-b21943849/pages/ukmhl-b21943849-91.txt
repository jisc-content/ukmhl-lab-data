INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 79 and this divided; additional injection was then made into the proximal part of the cord towards the internal ring. The sac was then isolated, opened, tied at the neck, and cut off, and the operation completed in the ordinary way. The patient felt a slight twinge of pain when the sac was ligatured, and on one occasion when the cord was inadvertently pulled too hard. He said that otherwise he felt the various manipulations, but that the parts seemed quite dead and the manipulations caused no pain. The wound healed by first intention. A year later he returned to have the left side operated on. The result of the former operation was perfect, a firm unyielding scar being present. The second operation was also done under local anaesthesia with an equally good result. Case XXV.—Mrs T. W., cet. 50 years.

Owing to the heart lesion present the administration of a general anaesthetic would have been distinctly dangerous, and the operation was done under local anaesthesia. The hernia of the left inguinal variety was the size of a large hen’s egg. Cocaine-adrenalin solution was in- jected all over and round the sac, at first subcutane- ously, and then as close to it as possible.

The constriction was at the externa] abdominal ring, which was divided and the intestine returned. The parts were brought together with catgut stitches and the wound closed without drainage. Less than 1 grain of cocaine was

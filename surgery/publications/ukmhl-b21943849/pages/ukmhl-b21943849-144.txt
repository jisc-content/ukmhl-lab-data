132 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY to inject the stovaine in the second interspace when it is necessary to paralyse the upper lumbar nerves, as in operations on the abdomen and groin, for by high injec- tion the solution is brought into more direct contact with all the nerves forming the cauda equina, including the upper ones which leave the spinal canal high up. If by so doing a smaller dose of stovaine is effectual than when injection is made lower down, high puncture seems all the more advisable. On the other hand, if it is only necessary to paralyse the lower lumbar and sacral nerves, injection in the third or fourth interspace will probably be as effectual as in the second. It must be recognised, however, that no certain method of con- trolling the distribution of the anaesthesia has yet been devised. In some cases it extends much higher than is necessary, involving even the whole trunk, arms, ami part of the head, while in others it does not extend high enough. The rule that the bigger the dose the more extensive the area of anaesthesia, is evidently not absolutely, but only approximately, correct. If further experience shows that the plan of tilting the pelvis to a greater or less extent, as recommended by Donitz, is effectual in localising to some extent the action of the injected stovaine solution, a marked advance will un- doubtedly have been made in the technique of spinal anaesthesia. When cocaine-adrenalin solution was used, it was generally considered advisable to lower the patientâ€™s"pelvis and raise the head, to prevent a rapid diffusion of the cocaine up the spinal canal, with con- sequent symptoms of faintness, nausea, etc., due to the cocaine coming in contact with the upper pait of t ie cord and medulla. Stovaine appears to be relatively so non-toxic and unirritating that no danger is to be anticipated from the practice of raising the pelvis. This

56 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY cutaneous tissue round each cyst. The needle was then passed just through the skin over the convexity of each cyst, and the solution made to travel between it and the cyst wall, which it did readily. In ten minutes the cysts were transfixed, emptied, the capsules picked up and dissected out. A little pain was felt during the removal of one of the smaller cysts; the removal of the others was painless. It will be noted that no attempt was made to pass the needle below the cysts in this case, so as to infiltrate the tissue below them directly. Subsequent experience has shown that although the solution injected round the base of a cyst usually travels under it, this is not always the case, and it is, therefore, wiser to make a rule of passing the needle below a cyst so as to reach the underlying tissue directly, as well as round it and over it. The difficulty of making the injection travel in the subcutaneous tissue of the scalp, noted in the last case, is always met with in dealing with sebaceous cysts, but with care and patience a complete infiltration and analgesia can be produced. In the above case, 6 drachms of solution, i.e. less than \ a grain of cocaine, were used altogether. Case XI.â€”Mrs V., out. 48 years, suffering from a fatty tumour in the right posterior triangle of the neck, extending nearly to clavicle in front and over supra- scapular fossa behind, measuring 5 inches in its long axis and 2\ inches transversely. 3 ounces of cocaine- adrenalin solution =1^ grains of cocaine were used. The solution was injected first of all round the base of the tumour, then over the surface of it, between it and the skin, and lastly some was injected on the deep aspect, care being taken to avoid passing the needle near important vessels in the posterior triangle.

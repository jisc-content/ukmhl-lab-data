60 LOGAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY in dealing with them is to infiltrate the over-lying tissues, so that they may be painlessly exposed. Case XIII.—Mrs B. S. Patient came to hospital several days after receiving a cut on the dorsal aspect of the right thumb opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, which had divided the extensor longus pollicis tendon and thus rendered full extension of the thumb impossible. The wound was suppurating freely, so anti- septic dressings were applied for some days till the wound was healthy and granulating well. An attempt was then made to unite the divided tendon. Cocaine- aclrenalin solution was injected subcutaneously all along the dorsal aspect of the metacarpal bone of the thumb and along the first phalanx, i.e. proximal and distal to the wound. The wound edges and the granulating surface were then excised, and, thereafter, incisions were made exposing the divided ends of the tendon which were slightly adherent to the surrounding tissues. The ends were freed, refreshed, and brought together with silk sutures, and the skin united over them. The operation was painless. Unfortunately, suppuration occurred, and the union eventually broke down. Doubt- less the operation should not have been done till after the wound had healed for some time, when there would have been less risk of infection occurring. The case is reported because it showed that the operation was easily done under local anaesthesia, and because it showed the unwisdom of opening up tissues in the neighbourhood of an apparently healthy wound. Ganglion.—Many methods of treating ganglion have been recommended from time to time, from the simple plan of bursting the ganglion with a smart blow, to the more complicated method of exposure and complete ex- cision of the sac. An easy and satisfactory plan is to

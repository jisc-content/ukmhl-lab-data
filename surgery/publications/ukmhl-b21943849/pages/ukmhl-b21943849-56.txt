44 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY rule to ask no questions as to pain during operation, in order to avoid any suggestion that one is uncertain of the power of the cocaine to prevent pain. Should real pain be felt the patient may safely be trusted to intimate it by word or gesture, without being asked. In order to obtain the best results while operating under local anaesthesia it is necessary to work as far as possible by careful dissection with very sharp instru- ments. All blunt dissection, pulling, or tearing should be carefully avoided, for they are liable to cause pain by pulling on structures outside the anaesthetic area. In excising the tuniica vaginalis, for example, in doing a radical cure of hydrocele, the coverings should be dis- sected and not torn or pulled off the tumica; or in doing a radical cure of inguinal hernia, the sac should be carefully dissected and not torn off the cord. The blunt dissector and fingers should be used as little as possible, and their place be taken by the knife and dis- secting forceps. Owing to the action of the adrenalin, bleeding, as a rule, is very slight. When the vaso-constrictor action of the drug wears off, slight reactionary haemorrhage may take place, especially in places where firm pressure cannot be exerted by a bandage. It is well, therefore, to ligature any points which show the least tendency to bleed during operation, and in places where little or no pressure can be applied it is often wise to insert a small drain for the first twenty-four hours after operation, in order to prevent any accumulation of blood in the wound. The analgesia produced by cocaine or eucaine adrenalin solutions lasts, as a rule, for at least one and a half hours; often very much longer, and, in any event, quite long enough for the performance of any operation which can be suitably done under local anaesthesia.

INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA. 4:} can be accurately controlled. In this connection it may be stated that bathing the deeper tissues with solution after their exposure, in the hope that they may be thereby rendered analgesic, is quite useless. If sensitive tissues have to be cut through, they must be infiltrated and not merely bathed with solution. When the injections have been completed, time must be allowed for the cocaine or eucaine to act. In the case of the cocaine mixture ten minutes from the time of finishing the injections is enough ; when eucaine is used twenty minutes or sometimes even half an hour must be allowed for the drug to take full effect. Marked blanching of the skin over the injection area appears in three or four minutes after the injection, due to the powerful vaso-constrictor action of the adrenalin in the solution. If no blanching appears, it may be con- cluded that the adrenalin used has been decomposed and has not acted, and imperfect anaesthesia may be expected. This blanching lasts for a varying time according to the amount of the adrenalin in the solution. With the strength recommended it lasts for one and a half hours at least, and often much longer. When sufficient time has been allowed for the cocaine or eucaine to act, the opera- tion should be begun. It is well not to pinch or prick the skin over the injection area and ask the patient if pain is felt. A certain amount of tactile sensibility is nearly always retained, and patients are apt, when nervous, to misinterpret their sensations and mislead the operator. If the injections have been properly made the skin will be absolutely analgesic though not anaesthetic. It is a good rule, after waiting the necessary time, to cover the patientâ€™s face with a handkerchief or towel to prevent a view of the operation, and to make the incision at once without asking any questions. It is also a good working

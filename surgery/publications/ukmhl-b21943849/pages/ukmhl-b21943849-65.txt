INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 53 continued without questions being asked. If serious pain is felt, the patient may be trusted to make it known; on the other hand, if questions are asked, the suggestion that pain may he felt and that the operator is uncertain of the effect of the injections is apt to make patients nervous and apprehensive, and cause them to exaggerate any trifling pain which may be caused. Operations Involving the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue. Skin grafting, by Thiersch's or other method. Excision of qiatches of tubercular or lupoid skin. Excision of rdcers, with or without subsequent skin grafting. Eemoval of warts, moles, epitheliomata. Removal of sebaceous and dermoid cysts. Removal of fatty, fibrous, sarcomatous, and other tumours. Thiersch Grafting. —The injection should be made as close to the skin, without being actually endermic, as possible, and the attempt made to distribute an even uninterrupted layer of solution just below the skin. An area of about 6 square inches can easily he rendered analgesic with 3 ounces of solution. In ten minutes grafts may be removed in the ordinary way. Care must be taken not to go outside the area covered by the injection, for the removal of Thiersch grafts from skin which has not been amesthetised is exceedingly painful.

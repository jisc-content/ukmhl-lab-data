34 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY for general use. The common plan of dissolving 60 grains of sodium chloride in a pint of water to produce a “ normal saline solution ” gives a solution slightly weaker than this, between '6 and -75 per cent., but the difference is so slight as to be almost negligible. When, however, injections have to be made into inflamed and very sensitive tissues care must be taken to make the solutions absolutely isotonic. Whether Schleich’s original solution or Braun’s modification of it is used, the method of injecting is exactly the same, and may be briefly described as follows. All the tissue to be cut through must he thoroughly cedematised with the solution. The cutis, subcutaneous fat, muscles, fasciae, periosteum, etc., must all be treated separately. As in Beclus’ method, cutis and subcutaneous tissue may be successfully treated before any incision is made, but deeper layers must be cedematised as they are exposed. Eepeated injections are therefore necessary during any operation involv- ing tissues below the subcutaneous fat. Analgesia follows as soon as the tissues are cedematised, and lasts for about twenty minutes. It does not extend at all beyond the oedematised area. In inexperienced hands the method is apt to give unsatisfactory results, as a rule because the tissues are not rendered sufficiently oedematous. According to Schleich, “ the infiltrated area must project high over the normal level of the surrounding tissues, taking the form of an oedematous, broad based, sessile tumour. On incision the tissues should have a glassy or jelly-like appearance, the tissue fibrils being spread out, and the cut surface weeping like that of a cucumber oi oui ripe melon. An infiltrated penis, lip, or ear lobule must appear as if affected with elephantiasis, and pen-

30 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA LN GENERAL SURGERY cocaine and -2 per cent, of sodium chloride can produce an insensitive wheal. G. Morphia in solutions of '1 per cent, also produces an insensitive wheal. Schleich also believed that the pressure produced by the injection diminished the conducting power of the sensory nerves and their endings, and further that cold solutions were more effective than solutions warmed to body temperature. Basing himself on these observations he devised his method of producing local anaesthesia, the essential feature of which is the production of a complete oedema of all the tissue to be cut with weak solutions of cocaine which are not “ isotonic,” but what may be termed “ subtonic,” to the tissue fluids. He recommended three standard solu- tions for use, which were made up as follows:— No. 1. Cocaine, .... Hydrochlorate of morphia, . Sodium chloride, Distilled water, . No. 2. Cocaine, .... Hydrochlorate of morphia, . Sodium chloride, Distilled water, . No. 3. Cocaine, .... Hydrochlorate of morphia, . Sodium chloride, Distilled water, . 0-2 gram. 0025 „ •2 „ 100 c. c. 0-l gram. 0-025 „ •2 „ 100 c.c. O'Ol gram. 0-025 „ •2 „ 100 c.c. It will be noted that these vary only in the amount of cocaine which they contain. No. 2 is that recom- mended for general use, and is what is generally known

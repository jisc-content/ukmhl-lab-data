DRUGS FOR. LOCAL ANAESTHESIA 7 advantages which might follow the combination of the suprarenal active principle with cocaine and allied drugs, and of having fully worked out the subject and shown the advantages of this, the most notable advance in the technique of local anaesthesia since Schleichâ€™s demonstration of the analgesic properties of very dilute solutions of cocaine. By a number of experimental and clinical observations on himself, on others, and on animals, Braun showed that the addition of adrenalin to solutions of cocaine and eucaine increased and pro- longed their analgesic action to a very marked degree and at the same time diminished their general toxicity, acting, in fact, very much like the application of a tourniquet in this respect. This action of adrenalin is probably due to the marked local ischaemia which follows its injection into the tissues, this ischcemia causing delay in the absorption of the cocaine, and therefore localising and increasing its analgesic action. It is manifested even when adrenalin is used in the most minute doses and in extreme dilution, and is of such advantage that it should be a universal rule to combine it with all solutions for producing local anaesthesia, unless it is desired to avoid the production of an ischaemia in the area of operation. As the analgesic action of cocaine wears off, there is sometimes a considerable degree of wbat may be termed reactionary pain. Little reference is made to this by writers on local anaesthesia, but its occurrence is undoubted. Schleich1 maintained that one of the advantages of adding minute doses of morphia to his solutions was that the after-pain was thereby diminished, but, apart from this, he makes little reference to the 1 Schleich, Schmerzlose Operational, Julius Springer, Berlin, 1898, 3rd edition.

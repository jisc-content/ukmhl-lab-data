41 INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA solution should be injected in sufficient quantity to produce a slight but distinct swelling along the line of injection. When the needle has been entered in its whole length it should be partly withdrawn and pushed to one and then to the other side of its original track, so as to produce an anaesthetic area not only in the line, but to either side, of the proposed incision. Renewed punctures may then be made so as to introduce the solution all along the line of proposed incision, beyond it, at either end, and on either side. Special importance is attached to this overlapping. It is often found that original incisions need to be enlarged a little, or that skin must be reflected to one or other side to give more room. I have frequently seen trouble arise when local analgesia was being used, because a wide enough area had not been covered by the injections. It is a safe working rule always to provide a wide margin in case unexpected difficulties are met with. It is difficult to convey by description the amount of ffiiid which must be injected for a given length of skin incision. 3-4 drachms suffice, as a rule, for an incision 2|-3 inches long. If a slight but uniform swelling is produced over the whole area of injection, enough will probably have been used. When the subcutaneous fat is very abundant, a second set of injections may be made at a deeper level than the first to render it analgesic: as a rule this is unnecessary. In operations involving tissues deeper than the subcutaneous fat, the question then arises as to whether these should be infiltrated before or after exposure. In Reclus’ and Schleich’s methods the deeper tissues must, as a rule, be dealt with after they are exposed. In using cocaine-adrenalin solution, how- ever, it is often possible to infiltrate sufficiently muscles,

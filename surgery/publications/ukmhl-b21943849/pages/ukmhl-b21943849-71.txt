INFILTRATION ANESTHESIA OPERATIONS 59 should be injected in the subcutaneous tissue along both sides of the dilated vein and must be distributed along the whole length of the skin over the portion of vein or veins to be dealt with. The veins can then be exposed, and divided, excised, or ligatured as preferred. Some cases of varicose veins are too extensive and too complicated for efficient treatment without a general anaesthetic, but on the other hand, local anaesthesia gives excellent results in a large number of cases. Case XII.—A. B., male, cet. 40 years, with left in- ternal saphenous vein very varicose for 6 inches just above the knee, and a large bunch of tortuous dilated thin-walled veins over the inner aspect of the tibia and the adjacent muscles at the middle of the leg. Cocaine- adrenalin solution was injected all along the dilated portion of the saphenous vein above the knee, and also all round and above the bunch of dilated veins in the leg. In ten minutes 5 inches of the saphenous vein were removed and numerous entering branches liga- tured, all without pain. I he skin was then partly reflected from the bunch of veins in the leg, and some of them were excised and the rest divided and ligatured. Owing to the extreme thinness of the veins here, there was a good deal of trouble from bleeding, and owing to the fact that the veins lay directly on the periosteum of the tibia, some pain was felt when they were dissected off as no effort had been made to infil- trate under the veins. The case was an unusually diffi- cult one, but in spite of that the pain felt was trifling. The result was good ; the wounds healed by first inten- tion, and the bunch of veins in the leg was obliterated. Tendon Suture : Tenotomy.—Tendons themselves are insensitive and may be divided or stitched once they are exposed, without pain. All that is necessary

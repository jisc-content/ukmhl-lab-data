91 INFIL TRA TION A NAESTRES1A OPERA TIONH was injected under the line of incision in the groin just above the scrotum. The needle was then passed to either side of and into the cord, and solution injected in these situations. In ten minutes the incision was made, the coverings of cord divided, and more solution injected into the cord. The dilated veins were then freed from the rest of the cord for 2 inches, clamped, divided, ligatured, and the two ends tied together in the usual way. A small drain was put in and the wound closed. After-pain was slight and continued for two days. The wound healed by first intention. Operations in the Ano-rectal Region. Simple cases of fissure of the anus, haemorrhoids, and fistula in ano may suitably be operated on under local anaesthesia. Haemorrhoids: Internal, external, or combined external and internal.—Infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue all round the anal margin to well beyond the area of any external pile present, and infiltrate the sub- mucous tissue all along the anal canal, carrying this submucous infiltration beyond the pile-bearing area. Then pass the needle in the axis of the anal canal into the surrounding sphincter and infiltrate it, the general result being to infiltrate thoroughly the submucous and muscular coats of the lower end of the bowel. By gently stretching the anus and asking the patient to strain, internal piles can be brought into view, grasped by forceps and ligatured, or better, clamped, cut off, and sewn over by Mitchell’s method. The sphincter can sometimes be completely stretched without pain after infiltration, but not always, and this need not be

96 CHAPTEE IV REGIONAL ANAESTHESIA—-OBERST’S REGIONAL ANAESTHESIA —BRAUN’S METHODS OF INDUCING REGIONAL ANAES- THESIA BY PERINEURAL INJECTIONS, ETC. Regional Anaesthesia—By injecting cocaine into or immediately round a nerve trunk, a physiological block on the nerve may be produced, with resulting motor and sensory paralysis in the area of its distribution distal to the level of the injection. The resulting an- aesthesia is usually termed regional, or conduction anaesthesia (Leitungsancesthesie, Braun). Corning was apparently the first to note that cocaine injected round a nerve paralysed its conducting power. His obser- vations led to no very practical results, and the first practical application of perineural cocaine injections seems to have been made by Oberst1 of Halle, who found that digits could be rendered completely anaes- thetic if cocaine was injected round the nerves supply- ing them and localised at the site of injection by the application of a tourniquet proximal to the injection level. His method has become known as the Oberst or Corning-Oberst method of producing regional anaes- thesia. It is, although limited in its application, one 1 The description of this method was first published by Pernice, Deutsche medicinische IVochenschrift, 1890.

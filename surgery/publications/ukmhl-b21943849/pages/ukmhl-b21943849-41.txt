29 INFIL TRA TION*A NJEH Til EH IA produced with exceedingly weak solutions of cocam . The observations which formed the basis of the methoc which he ultimately developed, and which bears his name, may be summarised as follows. If 3 or 4 c.c. of any fluid are injected into the cutis, a localised cedematous swelling of the skin an “endemic wheal” (the “ endermatische quaddel of the Germans) is produced. The sensibility of this wheal varies according to the substance injected, and the concentration of the solution. Taking the sensibility of such a wheal as his standard of com- parison, Schleich compared the action of a number of drugs and solutions on it, and obtained the following results:— 1. Injection of physiological salt solution allows of the production of an endermic wheal painlessly, but the sensibility of the cedematised skin re- mains unaltered. Therefore the injection of physiological salt solution is painless and pro- duces no analgesia. 2. Injection of distilled water causes a burning pain, succeeded in a few seconds by complete insensi- bility of the cedematised area. 3. Saline solution of "2 per cent, strength causes, during its injection, a very slight discomfort, quickly followed by complete analgesia of the wheal raised. 4. Cocaine in solution of '02 per cent, in distilled water can be painlessly injected, and produces an insensitive wheal. Weaker solutions of cocaine in water have not this effect. 5. The power of cocaine is increased if it is dissolved in '2 per cent, salt solution, so that even a solu- tion containing '01 per cent. (1 in 10,000) of

Rib Resection for Empyema.—Local anaesthesia is of the greatest value in operating for empyema. The majority of cases in adults and well-grown boys and girls, where a portion of a rib has to he removed to drain an empyema, can be operated on under local analgesia. The obvious dangers of general antesthesia when the respiration and circulation are embarrassed can thereby be avoided, and the operator can work single - handed or with unskilled assistance. The patient may be laid on the sound side and the portion of rib to be removed carefully defined. The subcu- taneous tissue is then infiltrated in the oi’dinary way over an area extending well beyond the proposed incision at each end and about \\ inches broad. The needle is then gently pushed on and the muscular layer infiltrated over the same area, and afterwards the needle is pushed down to the periosteum and a layer of solution carefully injected all along and at the edges of the portion of rib to be removed. In some cases the inner aspect of the rib can be reached with a syringe provided with a right-angled mount or a right- angled needle, but this is often not possible. Full time should be given for the cocaine-adrenalin to act. The skin, muscle, and periosteal incision may then be nyade quite painlessly, and the periosteum can be reflected

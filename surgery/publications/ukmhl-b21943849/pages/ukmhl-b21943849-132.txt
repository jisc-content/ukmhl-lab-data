120 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY observations which he has made, the reader is referred to his recent book on Local Anaesthesia. Hackenbruch’s Circular Anaesthesia. — Fre- quent reference is made by writers on local anaesthesia to what is termed “ Hackenbruch’s circular anaesthesia.” By this is meant the plan, apparently first devised or used by Hackenbruch, of infiltrating the tissues round a limited field of operation with cocaine solution so as to cut off its nerve supply, without actually infil- trating the tissues to be cut through directly. This method may be used successfully in dealing with limited superficial conditions, such as ganglia on the back of the wrist or hand, or small prepatellar bursae, and is someLimes of value in treating limited inflam- matory and suppurative conditions, such as large boils, carbuncles, superficial abscesses, etc. The injection may be made in the form of a circle, or a diamond, from two to four separate punctures being usually necessary to complete the figure. On the extremities, where the direction of the nerves in the subcutaneous tissue sup- plying a given area can be accurately determined, it is often unnecessary to completely encircle the operation field, and a gap in the ring may be left on the distal side, the injection then taking the shape of a horse-shoe or inverted Y. Speaking generally, the results of such injections are apt to be uncertain, and this form of regional amesthesia should only be employed where it is impossible to infiltrate the area of operation directly. On the hand and foot, however, this principle may be used with greater certainty for anaesthetising limited areas; for example, the tissues at the level of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of a digit. I he injection should be made in the shape of a wide open V embrac- ing the affected area, first in the subcutaneous tissue,

128 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY and to an “ aseptic meningitis” following the injections. Many efforts were made to render the method harmless. Eucaine, tropa-cocaine, etc., were used instead of cocaine, cerebro-spinal fluid was used instead of water and saline solution to dissolve the drugs in, but no real improvements resulted. Stovaine, discovered by Four- neau, has however proved to be much more suitable for inducing spinal amesthesia than any drug hitherto used for the purpose. Although weaker than cocaine, and having therefore to be used in correspondingly larger doses, it produces a complete and satisfactory antesthesia, said to be rarely attended by complications and rarely followed by disagreeable after effects, and such compli- cations and after effects as do occur are said not to be serious. Technique.—The method of inducing spinal anaes- thesia to be described is that used in Professor Bier s clinique in Bonn and described by Donitz.1 No special preparation of the patient is necessary, but it is well to operate at a time when the stomach is empty, in case a general anaesthetic has to be given to supplement an in- complete or transient spinal anaesthesia. Children under fifteen or sixteen are unsuitable subjects for spinal anaesthesia. A fine trocar and cannula with an available length of 3^-4 inches, and a small glass-barrelled syringe graduated in c.c., which fits the end of the cannula accurately, are used for making the injections. After thorough cleansing of the skin in the lumbar region the patient is, if possible, placed in the sitting position, with the head and trunk strongly flexed, in order to open out the lumbar interspaces fully. If unable to sit, tie patient must lie on a table, the head and trunk being flexed as before. The iliac crests are then palpated and i Donitz, Archiv fur klinische Chirurgie, 1905, Band 77, Heft 4.

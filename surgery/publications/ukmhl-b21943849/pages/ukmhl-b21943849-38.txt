26 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY without inconvenience, but it is sufficient for all opera- tions which can be done under local anaesthesia. Before making the injections the patient is made to lie down. Reclus makes this an invariable rule in using cocaine, in order to minimise any tendency to syncope. He also recommends that the patients should not rise till one hour after the first injection, and that they should drink a little coffee or milk or soup before walking away. He advises also that patients should have a light meal not long before operation. In making the injections, Reclus pinches up the skin at one end of the proposed incision, introduces the needle into the dermis, not the subcutaneous tissue, and injects the solution slowly into the true skin, pushing the needle slowly further along in the same layer the while. When the needle is fully inserted the syringe is generally empty, and is withdrawn. The injection produces a band, 1-2 c.m. broad, of oedematised skin, marked on the surface by a blanching and slight swelling along the line of injection. This manoeuvre is repeated till the whole length of the proposed incision has been thus treated. For the second and succeeding injections the needle is entered just within the area covered by the preceding one, which will be found already analgesic. In this way a band of analgesic skin, 1-2 c.m. broad, is almost instantly produced. Succeeding layers of tissue must be infiltrated as they are exposed in the same manner, each layer being treated by itself, with the exception of the subcutaneous fat, which when scanty needs very little treatment, but when abundant may be dealt with before incising the skin. The method may perhaps be more easily understood from Keclusâ€™ description of his technique in performing a radical cure of inguinal hernia. An analgesic band is first made in the skin as

CHAPTER II INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA, RECLUS’ METHOD, SCHLEICH S METHOD, INFILTRATION WITH COCAINE-ADRENALIN OR EUCAINE-ADRENALIN MIXTURES Infiltration Anaesthesia.—In the present chapter the methods of inducing local amesthesia by injecting solutions of cocaine, etc., directly into the tissues to be operated on, and generally termed “ infiltration anaes- thesia,” will be described. In the following chapter, operations which may be suitably done under infiltra- tion anaesthesia will be indicated, and illustrative cases will be briefly described. Reclus’ Method.—The oldest method is that gener- ally associated with the name of Paul Reclus, who developed it first and still continues to use it with marked success. The following is his plan. He uses a syringe holding 2 c.c., with a needle about 3^ centi- metres long. The syringe must be one readily sterilised, and with a strong finger-grip on the barrel, for considerable pressure has to be used in making injections into dense tissues, such as those of the scalp, palm of the hand, etc. The strength of the cocaine solution used is ^ per cent., i.e. 1 grain in 220 minims. In \ per cent, solution a dose of 20 centigrammes (3 grains) may, according to Reclus, be injected without danger. He has exceeded that dose several times

135 SPINA L A NJBSTHES1A apparently in about 4 per cent, of cases in the practice of those who have most experience in spinal anaesthesia, probably in a larger number in the practice of others. Deaths following spinal anaesthesia induced by stovaine have been reported, but only in a few cases where the condition of the patients was already grave and death from the illness present was only to be expected. No death due to the toxic action of stovaine has, as far as I am aware, been recorded. Infective meningitis has also been recorded, but only in cases where infective lesions were already present in other parts of the body, such as pneumonia or suppura- tive peritonitis. With ordinary care, there should be no risk of infecting the spinal meninges in introducing stovaine by lumbar puncture; but it would seem wise to avoid doing so when serious infective lesions are present elsewhere in the body. The operations which can be done under spinal anaes- thesia include all operations on the lower extremities, on the rectum, perineum, scrotum and penis, on the bladder and female genital organs, hernia, appendicitis, etc.â€”in fact, practically all operations on parts of the body below the umbilicus. In a certain number of cases the anaesthesia extends above the umbilicus, but this is not to be depended on, and operations on the upper abdomen should not be attempted under spinal anaesthesia. It is not possible yet to estimate the true value of spinal anaesthesia with stovaine in surgical work. That it involves less risk to life than general anaesthesia seems probable, but has not yet been proved. IVtany thousands of cases must be recorded before a decision on this point can be reached. For major operations where general or spinal anaesthesia is necessary, the

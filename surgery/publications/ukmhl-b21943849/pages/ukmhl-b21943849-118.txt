106 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY the pus is pointing often fails to open and dram the original abscess cavity thoroughly, and in the after treatment the patient is subjected to painful squeezings of the finger, in order to express the pus through an insufficient opening made in the wrong place. These cases should be treated by carefully clipping away the raised epidermis, inserting a probe through the opening in the cutis to find out the seat and size of the sub- cutaneous cavity, and the complete opening of this cavity. After-treatment is then much less uncomfort- able for the patient, and its period is, in many cases, materially shortened. The treatment of these abscesses may seem a small matter to discuss, but attention to little details of the sort is well worth while, for these abscesses often disable a working man or woman for two or three weeks, and anything which may shorten the treatment or make it easier is important. The removal of nails, of necrosed phalanges, the opening of tendon sheath whitlows, the removal of warts, of foreign bodies, and all amputations distal to the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, may be carried out under Oberst’s anaesthesia with perfect satisfaction. It is often also of great service in treating cases of severe lacerated wounds of one or more fingers, which manual workers so frequently meet with, and where it is essen- tial to thoroughly cleanse the wounded parts, and often necessary to trim edges or amputate parts of fingers. On the toes Oberst’s method is chiefly of use in removing ingrowing toe nails, exostoses, and in opeiating for hammer-toe by removing the head and pait of the shaft of the first phalanx. For all the conditions mentioned a general anaesthetic is never required, the anaesthesia produced by cocaine injections, properly made, being perfect.

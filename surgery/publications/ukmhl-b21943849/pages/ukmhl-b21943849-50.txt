Till the metric system has been uni- versally adopted, it is much more convenient to deal with the usual system of weights and measures in use in this country, clumsy as it is. The solutions should always be made up freshly for each operation.

The desired quantity is then poured into the measure glass, and one or more tablets of cocaine or eucaine added to it, as may be necessary. The adrenalin should next be dropped carefully out of its bottle without fully withdrawing the stopper, and after a preliminary cleansing of the lip with 1 in 20 carbolic solution. The mixture is then allowed to cool, during which time the syringe to be used may be washed out and thoroughly tested to see that it is in working order. Syringes are often a source of endless trouble. Those which I have found give most satisfaction are made entirely of metal, and for infiltration anaesthesia should be of 10 c.c. capacity, to avoid frequent withdrawal for refilling. The needles should be the finest compatible with strength. The best are those made of seamless steel tubing, with a soft metal expansion at the upper end. The needles fit into a special mount which screws on to the syringe, the end of which presses firmly against the soft metal part of the needle and so prevents all leakage.

Any good instrument maker will supply a syringe fitted with these needles, but every syringe should be

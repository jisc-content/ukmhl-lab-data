48 LOCAL ANMSTHESIA IN GEN UR A L SURGERY least. Sensory nerves, however, run in and through them and branch in them, and hence they must, as a rule, be infiltrated with the anaesthetic solution, unless the presence of sensory nerves in any particular part can be definitely excluded; hence also the importance of specially infiltrating along the line in any part where nerves are known to run. Periosteum is highly sensitive, bone denuded of periosteum is insensitive, hence ribs bared of periosteum may be painlessly divided in operating for empyema, and exostoses may be painlessly chiselled off when the periosteum has been rendered analgesic by the cocaine-adrenalin solution. Cocaine-adrenalin solution of the strength recom- mended in solution 1 is strong enough to paralyse small sensory nerves, the size of the ilio-inguinal as it lies in the inguinal canal, if the solution has been in contact with the nerve for ten minutes or thereby. Larger nerves, with denser sheaths, must be treated separately, and may be almost instantly paralysed by injecting into them a few drops of \ per cent, cocaine- adrenalin solution. If it is anticipated that large nerves will be met with in the course of any operation, a small quantity of solution should be prepared before- hand, to be ready when wanted. If 1 grain of cocaine be dissolved in 4 drachms of normal saline and 8 drops of adrenalin be added, a solution very slightly weaker than \ per cent, cocaine solution is made. Enough of this should be injected into the nerve with a fine needle, to produce a small fusiform swelling on the nerve. In a minute or two the nerve will be found absolutely analgesic, and may be freely bandied or even divided, without any pain being felt.

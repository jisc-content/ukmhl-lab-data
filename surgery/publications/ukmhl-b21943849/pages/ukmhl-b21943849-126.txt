114 LOCAL AN AES THE SI A IN GENERAL SURGERY better, at the elbow, behind the internal condyle. The ulnar nerve is so easily felt and located at the elbow that injection can generally be made directly into it, the result being an almost immediate anaesthesia in its distribution. The intraneural injection causes a thrill in the ulnar area in the hand like a strong faradic shock, but is not painful. The whole hand may be anaesthetised by injecting all three nerves in the manner described. Only \ grain of cocaine or a little more is required for this. The foot may be similarly anaesthe- tised by injecting the anterior and post-tibial nerves with i per cent, cocaine-suprarenal solution, and making a subcutaneous ring all round the leg just above the ankle, of 1 in 500 cocaine-suprarenin solution. I have had the opportunity of testing Braun’s methods on the hand and have found that they give excellent results; the ulnar and median nerves are easily located and reached by cocaine injections and the subcutaneous nerves can be still more easily interrupted at the wiist. For the treatment of suppurative conditions in the palm, or at the level of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, for metacarpo-phalangeal amputations, for the removal of foreign bodies lodged anywhere in the hand, for the treatment of severe crushes and wounds of the hand and fingers, and, in fact, for any operative treatment of the hand, anaesthesia induced by cocaine injections will in many cases, I believe, come to be the method of choice, for it seems to be safe, simple, and effective, the chief, if not the only, drawback being that perineural cocaine-suprarenin injections take sometimes twenty to twenty-five minutes to act. The following are examples of the use of Braun’s methods. Case XXXVII.—Miss J. L, cot. 21 years. While washing clothes, ten days before coming to hospital, the

42 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY fasciae, periosteum, the cellular tissue round tumours, etc., through the skin. Provided there is no risk of puncturing large arteries and veins, there is no reason why the needle should not be pushed through fasciae, into muscles and down to periosteum, the solution being slowly injected as this is done. In doing this it must be borne in mind that the deeper tissues, except perhaps the parietal peritoneum and other serous mem- branes, are much less sensitive than the skin, and that less solution is necessary to render them analgesic : also that although cocaine-adrenalin solution of the strength recommended for infiltration is too weak to affect large nerve trunks, it is strong enough to paralyse fine sensory nerve twigs, and therefore its action extends some distance beyond the actual area of injection if time is given for it to act. An endeavour should there- fore be made to make injections specially complete at the point or points where nerves supplying the field of operation enter it. In doing a radical cure of inguinal hernia for instance, special attention should be devoted to the outer and upper part of the field of operation where the ilio-inguinal nerve and twigs of the ilio- hypogastric nerve are met with under the external oblique aponeurosis. When there is no risk of wounding important vessels the infiltration of deeper tissues may often be successfully carried out from the surface and the attempt should always be made, for it is a great convenience to be able to finish an operation once it is begun without making repeated injections and waiting for them to act. When, however, there is any risk of wounding an important artery or vein, and so injecting solution in any quantity directly into the blood stream, injection of deeper tissues must be deferred till they are exposed and the course of the injecting needle

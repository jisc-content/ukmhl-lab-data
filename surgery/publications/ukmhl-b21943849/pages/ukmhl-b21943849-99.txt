INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 87 the cord at the upper end of the scrotum. Cushing has shown that the ilio-inguinal and genito-crural nerves innervate the testis, tunica vaginalis, and cord, but not the scrotal skin. If they are reached by the injection, no pain will be felt in doing the operation while handling the deeper parts. In dealing with very large hydroceles it is difficult to distribute the available amount of solution over the whole hydrocele, but if special attention be directed to the cord and upper part, and an inguinal or small scrotal incision made, no pain will be felt. Case XXX.—A. X., cet. 26 years, suffering from a left- sided hydrocele, the size of a goose’s egg. The hydrocele had been present for two years, its first appearance dating from a trauma received in a bicycle accident. 20 drachms of cocaine-adrenalin solution = grains of cocaine, were injected along the line of the inguinal incision, round the upper end of the hydrocele, the cord, and over the hydrocele. In ten minutes the hydrocele was exposed and found to be multilocular, one large and two small pouches being found. The testis itself was covered with a network of soft fibrous material, probably organised lymph. The parietal tunica vagi- nalis was all cut away, bleeding points tied, and the cut edges stitched to the adjacent tissues with catgut. The wound was closed without drainage. After-pain came on several hours after operation and was fairly severe, lasting through the night following the opera- tion. Next day it was found that the scrotum had slipped from under the bandage and that there was a good deal of effusion into it. This quickly disappeared with elevation of the scrotum and proper bandaging, and the wound healed without suppuration. The patient was heard of six months after operation, and

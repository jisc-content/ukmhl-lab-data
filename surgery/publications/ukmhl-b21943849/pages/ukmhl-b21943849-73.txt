INFILTRATION ANESTHESIA OPERATIONS 61 infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue over and round the ganglion with cocaine-adrenalin solution and then dis- tribute some solution round its base. After waiting for the cocaine to act, the ganglion may be exposed and partly cleared. It should then be opened, and the jelly- like contents expressed when the interior may be in- spected and the relations of the ganglion made out. The greater part of the wall can then be removed with- out disturbing the tendon or tendons which lie in its neighbourhood. Many ganglia are not simple sacs, but are to a certain extent multilocular, there being generally in such cases a main sac, superficially placed, communicating with smaller and deeper diverticula which may pass down to the ligaments of the wrist or other joint near which the ganglion is lying. The whole sac and any diverticula from it should be laid freely open, and as much of the wall clipped away as can be reached without disturbing the synovial cover- ing of tendons near which the ganglion is growing. The wound should then be closed without drainage and a firm bandage applied. This procedure is easy, pain- less, and always, I believe, gives satisfactory results. Case XIV.â€”Mrs B., cet. 33 years. Patient had a ganglion the size of a small tangerine orange over the extensor longus digitorum tendon in front of the left ankle joint. The ganglion had been punctured and emptied some months before, but had filled up again almost immediately afterwards. A solution containing 1 grain of cocaine, 1 grain of eucaine, 12 drops of adrenalin chloride solution 1 in 1000, to 3 ounces of normal saline solution (Solution iii.) was used. 14 drachms of this solution were injected over and round the ganglion, special attention being paid to distributing the solution round the base of the swelling.

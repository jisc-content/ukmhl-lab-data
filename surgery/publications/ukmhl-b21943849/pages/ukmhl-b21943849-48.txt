36 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY modifications of both methods, and has resulted in the development of a plan which is in a sense intermediate between the two older ones, although giving very much more satisfactory results. It may be emphasised once more that adrenalin intensifies the action of local anal- gesics, prolongs their action, and lessens their general toxicity. As the result of this, weaker solutions may be used than M. Reclus recommends with equal effect, and on the other hand a very much less complete oedema than Schleich’s method requires, suffices to produce analgesia which lasts, as a rule, for two or more hours. Stated generally, it may be said that complete anal- gesia of tissues may be produced by injecting into them weak cocaine adrenalin or eucaine-adrenalin solutions, in sufficient quantity to produce a moderate distention or oedema. One important point may be noted here in amplification of this general statement, with reference to the skin. Endermic injections are not necessary to render the cutis analgesic. In using older methods endermic injections were always necessary for this, but with cocaine-adrenalin solutions injection into the sub- cutaneous tissue close below the true skin renders the cutis quite analgesic if time is given for the solution to take effect. Solutions of the following strengths are recommended for inducing infiltration anaesthesia :— No. 1. Cocaine hydrochloride, 1 grain. Solution adrenalin chloride (1 in 1000), 12 drops. Solution sodium chloride ('75 per cent.), 2 ounces. No. 2. Eucaine lactate, . • • • 1 grain. Solution adrenalin chloride (1 in 1000), 5 drops. Solution sodium chloride ('75 per cent.), . 10 drachms.

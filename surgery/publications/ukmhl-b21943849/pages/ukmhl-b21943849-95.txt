INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OFF RATIONS 83 more extensive records of other writers quoted, but space will not permit of this. My own comparatively limited experience is only confirmatory of what has already been amply demonstrated by others, that many cases of hernia may be operated on, to relieve stran- gulation or to do a radical cure, under local anaesthesia, without causing the patient any, or only trifling, pain. The following may be quoted from Cushing1 as the opinion of a surgeon who was not specially interested in local anaesthesia, who had no special method of his own to advocate, and who may therefore be fairly regarded as unbiassed in his opinion of its merits and demerits :— Almost all cases of hernia, with the possible excep- tion of those in young children, could undoubtedly be subjected to the radical operation under similar local methods, but when a general anaesthetic can safely be administered, for various reasons it is much to be pre- fened by both patient and operator.” In a footnote to this, however, he adds:—“ Since this paragraph was written, the above statements may be qualified to a considerable extent. During the fall of 1899, twenty- four herniotomies with cocaine or eucaine B have been performed in young men practically without pain, and this procedure has become so popularised in the ward where our hernia cases are admitted that the operation under the local anaesthetic has become the operation of choice.” Cushing, it should be noted, used Schleich’s method and also specially cocainised the ilio-inguinal and ilio- hypogastric nerves when they were exposed With cocaine-adrenalin solution this is unnecessary The operataon l,e did was Halsteds.

REGIONAL ANAESTHESIA 99 lias found that cocaine in 1 or \ per cent, solution, with the addition of suprarenin or other adrenal preparation, will completely paralyse a sensory nerve if it can be injected into the connective tissue immediately round it, and time is given for it to diffuse into the nerve. The paralysis lasts generally for two hours or longer, and allows of any operation being painlessly per- formed in the area supplied by the treated nerve and it alone. Braun’s results may best be indicated in his own words: ‘As far as the extremities are con- cerned, the surest and simplest method of producing anaesthesia for all operations on the hand and foot is to infiltrate completely with weak anaesthetising solutions a layer of tissue bounding the field of operation on the proximal side (as regards its nerve supply). In the forearm and leg the large subfascial nerve trunks, such as the ulnar, musculo-spiral, median, tibial, external popliteal, can be anaesthetised at definite points, on account of their accessible position, by injection of strong solutions immediately round them, whereby after ten to fifteen minutes as a general rule, a block, i.e. sen- sory, motor, and partial vasomotor paralysis, follows in the distribution of the affected nerve. On account of the variable distribution of particular nerves, a satisfactory conduction anaesthesia of practical value is generally only to be obtained by the simultaneous blockao-e of several nerves. The long cutaneous nerves running in the subcutaneous tissue are much more easily interrupted lhettiermi“ati0n following KrogW pla„ of infiltrating the subcutaneous tissue along a line at right angles to the course of the nerves. For amesthe- tismg large subfascial nerves, j to 1 per cent, cocaine solutions with suprarenin are best, for smaller nerves i mining in the subcutaneous or subfascial tissues f per

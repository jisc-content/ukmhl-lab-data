90 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY to it and dissected out. Diseased or imperfectly de- scended testes may be removed by this method. Case XXXIII.—A. B., cet. 17 years, suffering from an imperfectly descended testis on the right side, which came as far as the external abdominal ring hut usually lay in the inguinal canal. Patient wished to enter the army and therefore wished the testis removed. The left testis was normally situated. The subcutaneous tissue and tissues round the testis were infiltrated with cocaine-adrenalin solution. In ten minutes an incision was made down to the external oblique, the tissues under the external oblique were then infiltrated and the oblique divided, exposing the cord and testis with tunica round it. The tunica was opened and the testis handled before the cord was thoroughly infiltrated, and a little pain was felt. The cord was then infiltrated more thoroughly and a pause of a few minutes made. Thereafter the cord was clamped, divided, ligatured, and the testis removed without any pain. There was no communication between the tunica and the general peritoneal cavity. The canal was closed with catgut sutures and the wound closed without drainage. Xo pain was felt except as mentioned above. About 3 ounces of solution = 1^ grains of cocaine, were used, but a quantity of this escaped from the tissues as they were cut. After-pain was slight. The wound healed by first intention. Varicocele.—No special directions need be given for making injections for the removal of varicocele. From what has already been said it will be obvious that the cord and the subcutaneous tissue only require infiltration. Case XXXIV.—B. R, aet. 15 years, suffering from a lar^e left-sided varicocele.

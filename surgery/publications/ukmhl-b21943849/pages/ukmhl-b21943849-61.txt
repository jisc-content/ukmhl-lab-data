INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 49 ligaturing of small vessels is apt to be painful. When cocaine-aclrenalin solution is used, the clamping and ligaturing of arteries and veins is painless. In the abdomen special conditions are present. Lennanderâ€™s1 observations have shown that the stomach and intestines, with their visceral peritoneal covering, the mesentery, the anterior edge of the liver, the gall bladder, the surface and substance of the kidney, the peritoneum covering the bladder, etc., are insensitive, and may be handled, cut, or burnt with the thermo- cautery without pain. The parietal peritoneum on the other hand is very sensitive to touch, pain, etc. As the result of his observations, Lennander has concluded that those organs and tissues of the body which are innervated exclusively by the sympathetic or vagus below the origin of the inferior laryngeal nerve have no nerve apparatus for the perception of pain, or heat and cold. He has further formulated the hypothesis that diseases of the abdominal organs only cause pain when they give rise to mechanical, chemical, or inflam- matory (bacillary or toxic) irritation of the cerebro- spinal nerves. The practical outcome of these observa- tions has been, so far, that some abdominal operations can be done without general anaesthesia and without paining the patient, provided the abdominal incision can be made painless by anaesthetising the abdominal walls along its line, and that the subsequent operation involves no handling or traction of the parietal peritoneum. The number of such operations is obviously limited, but the discovery of the fact that any abdominal operation can be done without general anaesthesia, and without paining the patient, marks a great advance in the history of abdominal surgery.

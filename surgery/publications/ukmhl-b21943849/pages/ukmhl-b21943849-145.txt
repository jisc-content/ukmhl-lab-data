133 SPINA L A NJESTHESIA may possibly be due to the fact that stovaine is said to deposit when mixed with the cerebro-spinal fluid, and so to localise itself chiefly in the immediate neighbour- hood of the injection. The object of moving the needle about slightly if the cerebro-spinal fluid does not flow freely is to get the point, if possible, to enter the small space mentioned and disentangle it from among the nerve roots on one or other side. The importance of using a hollow needle without a stylet for piercing the dura is considerable. The sensory roots lie in a plane posterior to the anterior or motor roots in the spinal canal, and to a certain extent in a compartment of their own, partially shut off from the anterior compartment by the ligamenta denticulata. It is therefore important to know exactly when the needle enters the subarachnoid space, and to make the injections there; for if the needle be pushed on towards the front the injected solution will be distributed more round the motor than the sensory nerve roots, and an imperfect anassthesia may result. By using a hollow needle, the cerebro-spinal fluid escapes the moment the subarachnoid space is entered, whereas if the stylet is retained till the sensation com- municated by piercing the ligamenta subflava is felt, as used to be advised, mistakes may easily be made by the inexperienced, and in cases where this sensation cannot readily be recognised. It is undoubtedly most convenient to keep the stovaine made up ready for use in little glass flasks which are broken directly before use, and the contents emptied or drawn into the injecting syringe. Such flasks, filled with a slight excess of sterile stovaine solution and epinephran (a reliable adrenal preparation made by Byk, Berlin), enough salt having been added to make

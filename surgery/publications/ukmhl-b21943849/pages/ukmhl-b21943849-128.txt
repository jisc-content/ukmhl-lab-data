116 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY caused no pain whatever, while the rubber band caused no discomfort. The wound healed by first intention. Case XXXVIII— J. H., male, ast. 54 years. As the result of a severe tendon sheath whitlow, the little finger of the patient’s left hand was left stiff and useless, the tendons having been destroyed. As the finger inter- fered very much with the patient’s work, he wished it removed. In this case the ulnar nerve was exposed behind the internal condyle by infiltrating the overlying tissues with very weak cocaine-adrenalin solution and dissecting down to the nerve. About 20 minims of cocaine-adrenalin solution, of the strength used in the previous case, were injected into the nerve, a very fine needle being used. The elbow wound was then closed. No rubber band was applied. The ulnar area became analgesic almost immediately after the injection, which caused a momentary tingling sensation as usual.

Patient had had part of a needle embedded in the ball of the right thumb for ten weeks, which caused her pain when she used her hand. The needle was located exactly with the help of the X-rays and fluorescent screen. After thorough cleansing of the skin of the wrist 30 minims of cocaine-suprarenin solution, of the strength used m the previous cases, were injected round the met lau

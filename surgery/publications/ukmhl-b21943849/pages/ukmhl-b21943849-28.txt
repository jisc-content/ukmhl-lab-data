1(5 LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY number, and Pouchet’s observations are certainly at direct variance with those of the majority of observers as to the relative toxicity of cocaine and eucaine. Most reliance is, I think, to be placed on the opinions of Braun, who has made extensive trial of both drugs, and the following may be quoted from his paper on regional anaesthesia, as indicating the relative value of the two drugs. “The action of eucaine B on nerve trunks (when injected round them) is slower than that of cocaine and tropa-cocaine; one must almost double the concentration of the eucaine solution to get equal effects to those of the latter drugs, and it cannot be satisfactorily used without arresting the circulation. If, on the other hand, eucaine B solutions are injected directly into nerve trunks they prove, according to Crile, just as powerful as cocaine solutions of equal strength. This agrees entirely with what I have often emphasised—that when they are brought into direct contact with nerve substance by infiltration, the drugs show little difference; but when a diffusion action is desired, cocaine is found to be much more effective.” Crile’s observations, to which Braun refers, were made, as noted above, on the effects of injecting cocaine and eucaine directly into nerve trunks, and they certainly support Braun s view that when eucaine is bi ought into immediate relation with nerve substance it acts as powerfully as cocaine. The important points in Braun’s view seem to me to be, first, that the two drugs are of equal power only when brought into the most direct relation with nerve substance, and second, that cocaine diffuses moie readily than eucaine among the tissues. In producing anaesthesia by infiltration, the chief difficulty is un- doubtedly to bring the solution into direct relation

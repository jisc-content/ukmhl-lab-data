DRUGS FUR LOCAL ANAESTHESIA 17 with the whole field of operation, more especially when the attempt is made to infiltrate the deeper tissues of any part before beginning an operation. If, therefore, cocaine diffuses among the tissues more readily than eucaine, it seems plain that it is to be preferred for infiltration, this property tending to make it act more completely and more quickly. Further, when adrenalin is combined with either drug, it has been found that smaller quantities of the solution may be used for infiltration than when it is not used, if time is given for the drug to act and to diffuse. As Braun1 also points out, this combination does not abolish the differ- ence in action between cocaine and eucaine, but rather increases it, and this again gives the preference to cocaine over eucaine for infiltration anaesthesia. The question then really turns on the relative toxicity of the two drugs. It must be admitted that eucaine seems to be less toxic than cocaine. All clinical ob- servations point conclusively in this direction, and Keclus is, as far as I am aware, the only clinician who maintains that the two drugs are equally toxic. As we have seen, his opinion is based on Pouchet’s ex- periments on animals, and little or no value is to be attached to it for that reason. What the exact relation of the two drugs is, as regards their toxic action, it is difficult to say. Eucaine was introduced after cocaine, and after the lesson had been at least partly learnt that care is necessary in 1 “ Es liisst sich leiclit erkennen, dass die anaestliesierenden Wirkungen die mit Adrenalin versetzten Cocainlosungen im Grossen und Ganzen, icli mochte sagen, imposanter sind als die del- Eukain- losungen. Die DifFerenz in der ortlichen Wirkung beider Mittel, an und fur sich nicht gross, wild durcli den Adrenalinzusatz nicht ausgeglichen, soudern elier zu Gunsten des Cocains etwas vergrossert. ” —Braun, Archiv fur Jdinische Chirwrgie, Berlin, 1903, Band 69. 2

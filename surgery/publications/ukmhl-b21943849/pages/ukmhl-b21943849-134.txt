122 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY by passing the needle nearly to the skin on the palmar aspect of the hand, and injecting solution as the needle travels. The injection must be made in the healthy tissue immediately bounding the diseased area on the proximal side. A solution containing 1 grain of cocaine and 6 drops of adrenalin in 1 ounce of saline solution is suitable for producing regional anaesthesia in this way. Amputation of Fingers at the Metacarpo- phalangeal Joint by Combined. Regional and Infiltration Anaesthesia.—In a number of cases I have made use of a combination of regional and infiltra- tion anaesthesia for metacarpo-phalangeal amputations by injecting ^ per cent, cocaine-adrenalin solution round the digital nerves in the hand above the level of the joint, and then reinforcing this by infiltrating the tissues to be cut through directly with a weaker solution. The reason for the reinforcement of the perineural injections is that it is not easy to locate the level of the digital nerves in the palm exactly, and hence the result of peii- neural injections alone is apt to be uncertain, especially where amputation is done for cases of old-standing sup- puration which has extended some distance into the palm. On the other hand, infiltration of the operation field alone is difficult, for the injection travels badly in the inflamed or thickened tissues. A combination of the two plans, however, is simple and effective, especially when a con- gesting band is applied at the wrist. The following cases will illustrate the method of making the injections. Case XLII.—J. M., male. cet. 20 years. Patient had had a suppurative osteomyelitis of the proximal phalanx of the left little finger for six weeks, following a com- pound fracture. The tendons were destroyed and ampu- tation was advised. The area of inflammation round the wound extended some distance on to the hand. 1 if teen

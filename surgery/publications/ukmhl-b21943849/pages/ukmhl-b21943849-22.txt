10 LOCAL AN/ESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY cases and has shown that they were due to improper use of the drug in doses and in solutions, which are admittedly unnecessary and dangerous and would never e use b} anyone familiar with the properties of cocaine. Thus cases of death are reported following the use of 4 grammes of 20 per cent, solution for inte- rnet iral injection, i.e. 12 grains of cocaine, of 20 grammes of a 2 per cent, solution for injection into the tunica vaginalis, i.e. 6 grains of cocaine. As Eeclus truly remarks, these are instances of the abuse of cocaine, not of its rational use. Cases of serious trouble following the use of small doses of cocaine in dilute solu- tion are so very rare that they may justly be attributed to idiosyncrasy on the part of the patient. Just as some people are specially susceptible to the action of morphia and other alkaloids, so occasional instances of suscepti- bility to the action of cocaine may be met with, and the occurrence of these rare and exceptional cases should not be allowed to interfere with the general use of cocaine, provided it is used in a rational way in accordance with rules which experience has shown make it a safe and satisfactory drug for inducing local anaesthesia. The only case I am aware of in which a fatal result followed the use of an apparently safe dose of cocaine is that reported by Simon 1 (since the publica- tion of M. Eeclusâ€™ work), where a man aged 24 years, an extremely sensitive subject, suffering from sexual neurasthenia, died shortly after the injection of 7 cm. of 1 per cent, cocaine into the urethra. The quantity used in this case was just over 1 grain of cocaine, but probably less than this amount was absorbed as some of the solution was allowed to escape when symptoms of poisoning set in two minutes after the injection. 1 0.

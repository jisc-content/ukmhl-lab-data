100 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY cent, cocaine-suprarenin solution is most suitable. The best results are got if the absorption of the cocaine- suprarenin solution is still further limited by applying an elastic bandage to the upper arm or thigh, tightly enough to cause a marked venous congestion, while waiting for the cocaine to act, or by holding the limb up vertically. The bandage must of course be removed before the operation is begun, or, if necessary, replaced by one completely arresting the circulation. Braun’s results afford one of the most striking proofs of the increased power of cocaine-adrenal solutions as compared with solutions of cocaine alone. Before the use of adrenal preparations in local anaesthesia many attempts were made to extend the use of perineural cocaine injections beyond the fingers and toes, but the results were disappointing. Only in cases where the circulation in a limb had been completely arrested by tourniquet for a long time could the cocaine action be localised sufficiently to make it concentrate its action on a nerve trunk when injected round it through the skin, and even then success was not invariable, and no practical and easily carried out method of inducing regional anaesthesia beyond the digits was devised. ^Not only does the adrenal addition localise the cocaine action sufficiently to enable it to paralyse a nerve as large as the external popliteal or median, but it enor- mously increases the duration of the resulting anaesthesia. In Crile’s experiments direct intraneural cocaine injec- tions only produced anaesthesia for half an houi 01 a little longer, whereas perineural cocaine-adrenal injec- tions give an anaesthesia of two hours, often indeed much longer. , , . , Braun has succeeded in anaesthetising by subfascial injections the cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus,

INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 95 except on the hand, where incisions must be carefully and deliberately made, to avoid damaging unaffected tendon sheaths, and cutting vessels and nerves. On the hand and fingers, some form of regional anaesthesia, to be described in the next chapter, is more satisfactory than direct infiltration. In other parts of the body superficial abscesses or other limited inflammatory con- ditions which require only a single quick incision, may be treated in most cases under the modified anaesthesia produced by freezing with ethyl chloride, while con- ditions requiring large or multiple incisions, or careful exploring with fingers or probe, are quite unsuited for local anaesthesia, and should be dealt with under a general anaesthetic.

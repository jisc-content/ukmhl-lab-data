INFILTRATION MYESTHESIA OPERATIONS 67 on the underlying tissues. Cocaine-adrenalin solution was injected round, over, and below the tumour, 4 drachms, i.e. I grain of cocaine, being used. Ten minutes later the tumour was dissected out. It was found to adhere fairly firmly to the parotid gland and to a branch of the great auricular nerve, which was divided in the dissection. During the operation the patient felt a dragging sensation in the wound, but it was not painful. There was no after-pain, and the wound healed by first intention. Maxillary Antrum.-—Drainage of the maxillary antrum in the canine fossa may be established as follows:—A small pledget of wool soaked in 5 per cent, cocaine solution should first be applied over the site of the needle puncture at the reflection of the mucous membrane from the jaw to the cheek above the canine tooth on the affected side. In five minutes the needle may be painlessly introduced, and the line of incision along the mucous membrane rendered analgesic by infiltrating freely the submucous tissue below it. The needle should then be passed down to the periosteum at the site of intended puncture and all round it. In ten minutes the incision may be made and the wall of the antrum bored through without pain, the usual method of drainage being then employed. For the removal of salivary calculi, rannulae, small malignant lip ulcers, no special directions are necessary. They may be treated on ordinary lines by carefully infiltrating the tissues all round them with cocaine- adrenalin solution. Tracheotomy.—Inadults tracheotomy should rarely lequire a general anaesthetic. The tissues overlying the trachea can easily be infiltrated from the surface, allowing the trachea to be exposed and opened pain-

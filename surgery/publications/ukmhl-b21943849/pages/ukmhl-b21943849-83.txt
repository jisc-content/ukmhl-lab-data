INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 71 acute right-sided empyema following pneumonia. The patient was very nervous and anxious to have a general amesthetic, which was promised if it was found neces- sary during the operation. Without previous adminis- tration of morphia, cocaine-adrenalin solution was injected along the ninth rib in the scapular line, the injections being made as described above. The opera- tion was easily completed without a general anaesthetic. Some pain was felt on reflecting the periosteum from the inner aspect of the rib, but it was only slight, and the patient lay perfectly still during the whole opera- tion. He was discharged from hospital four weeks later, having made a good recovery. Mammary Tumours.—Small, simple, well-defined mammary tumours can easily be exposed and enucleated painlessly under infiltration anaesthesia, the injection being made all round them in the usual way. If the tumour is not well defined from the rest of the gland, infiltration is apt t5 mask its outline and should not be used. Abdomen.—Fibrous or fibro-sarcomatous tumours not infrequently grow from the aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles. When small or moderate in size they may be removed under infiltration analgesia. Special care should be taken to infiltrate the surround- ing tissues thoroughly on the outer side, from which the nerve supply of the involved area comes. Gastrostomy, Colostomy, etc. — Lennander’s observations, which have been confirmed by other operators, have shown that the visceral peritoneum is insensitive and may be freely handled without causing pain. The parietal peritoneum, on the other hand, is highly sensitive when handled or dragged upon. The abdominal wall, including the parietal peritoneum, can

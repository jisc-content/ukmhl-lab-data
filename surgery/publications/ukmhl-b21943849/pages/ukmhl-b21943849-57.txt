INFILTEATION ANAESTHESIA 45 the anaesthesia wears off, a burning or smarting pain is felt in the wound, which lasts for several hours. Ihis is rarely severe, but occasionally is bad enough to call for the administration of a sedative. In such cases a hypodermic injection of morphia should be given: jj-i grain in an adult. This controls the pain, and by the time the effect of the morphia has worn off, the reaction- ary pain has gone. Wound healing is in the great majority of cases in no way interfered with by the injection of solutions used to produce local anaesthesia. The strictest asepsis is of course necessary in preparing and injecting the solu- tions, for the injection of a solution containing patho- genic organisms would almost certainly be followed b) suppuration, and possibly necrosis, in the area of injec- tion. A few cases of necrosis of the skin have been recorded after the use of solutions of cocaine, eucaine, and stovaine for producing local anaesthesia. The necrosis has been variously attributed to the use of non-isotonic solutions, to infection, and to the lowering of the vitality of the tissues by the poisonous action of the drugs used. Two of these supposed causes can be excluded with certainty in preparing the solutions, the third cannot. The occurrence of necrosis is fortunately, however, so very rare that it may almost be neglected in estimating the possible disadvantages attending the use of local anaesthesia. In a long series of cases operated on under local anaesthesia, I have never seen it occur.

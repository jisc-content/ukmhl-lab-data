102 LOCAL A WA'ISTHEHIA IN GENERAL SURGERY solution are then injected and the needle is slowly withdrawn, another 10 or 12 minims of solution being slowly injected as this is done. In this way a semi- circle of solution is made in the subcutaneous tissue round one half of the finger. This manoeuvre is then repeated on the other side of the finger, about 40 minims of solution being used altogether for a finger of average size. For very thick fingers or the great toe, more that 40 minims may be required to complete the circle, while for thin fingers and in children less will suffice. The method of making the injections is illustrated in fig. 3, which represents a cross section of the base of a finger with its nerve supply. The arrows indicate the lines taken by the needle. A small rubber tube, the size of a No. 10 catheter, is then loosely applied at the base of the finger, as in fig. 4, proximal to the injection level. In ten minutes—often in a shorter time —the finger or toe is completely ansesthetic, and the congesting band may then be removed. The effect of the injection must be carefully watched. It usually makes a visible bulging, especially on the dorsum where the tissues are lax. If there is no dorsal bulging, and it is, therefore, uncertain whether the ring of solution is complete on the dorsal aspect of the finger, the needle may be passed across the dorsum from one of the punctures before being completely withdrawn, and a few drops of solution injected there. As a matter of fact this is rarely necessary. Great care must be taken to apply the tourniquet loosely. It is sufficient to cause a marked venous Fig. 3.

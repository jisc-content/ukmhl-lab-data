50 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY cal application, the scientific interest of Lennanders observations and views is great, and it is to be hoped that those who operate under local anaesthesia will take the opportunities offered them of confirming and extending his observations on nerve distribution all over the body. Regarding the use of local anesthesia in patients of varying temperaments and ages there is little to be said. As a rule, children are not suitable subjects for it. There are exceptions, however, to this rule. 1 have on several occasions used both infiltration and regional anaesthesia on children, and the following are brief summaries of some cases where infiltration anaes- thesia has been successfully used. Case I.—I. C., girl, cet. 5| years, with small tubercu- lar ulcer on skin of arm. Schleich’s No. 1 solution was injected so as to raise the ulcer on a bed of injection. The injection was made from one puncture. The ulcer was dissected off painlessly. The amount of solution used was not noted. Case II.—L. R, girl, cet. 6 years, with needle embedded in palm of right hand, which had been there for ten weeks. The needle was lying to the ulnar side of the pa mai arch, nearly one inch below the pisiform bone, deep in the palm. Solution containing 1 gram of eucame B, with 8 drops of adrenalin to 1 ounce of normal saline was injected so as to infiltrate the tissues proxima to and round the needle. H drachms = i gram ot eucaine (approximately) were used. A broad elastic band was then applied round the wrist to arrest the circulation. In fifteen minutes the incision was made and after a dissection involving the retraction of t nerves running to supply the little finger, and the palmar arch, the needle was found and removed. The

REGION A L ANAESTHESIA 107 Circumcision in lacls and adults may also be con- veniently done under this form of local anaesthesia if the injections are made in the following way, described by Braun.1 The prepuce is first drawn forward over the glans so as to stretch the outer and inner layers. The needle is then entered on the dorsal aspect at the level of the coronal sulcus, and a subcutaneous ring made round the penis following the coronal groove accurately all the way round. In this way the nerve supply to both layers of the prepuce is cut off. If the injection is made further back the nerve supply to the inner layer of the prepuce may not be reached and amesthesia will not be complete. Braun recommends that the prepuce be held taut while the cocaine is acting, i.e. for five to ten minutes after the injection. A rubber tube loosely applied near the root of the penis is of advantage in localising and intensifying the cocaine action and causes no discomfort. By using the solution recommended for Oberst’s method of 1 grain of cocaine, 8 drops of adrenalin, and 4 drachms of saline solution, injected as described above, a most satisfactory anaesthesia of the prepuce can be obtained, allowing of its complete or partial removal without pain. From 1^ to 2 drachms of solution are usually required for an adult. Care should be taken to ligature all bleed- ing or oozing points to prevent a hmmatoma forming after the action of the adrenalin wears oft’. As pre- viously noted, circumcision may also be done under infiltration antesthesia, but the regional method is pre- ferable, for the prepuce is not rendered oedematous by it, and the amount to be removed can be more accurately gauged and the operation more conveniently done under it than under anmsthesia produced by direct infiltration. 1 Loc. supra cil.

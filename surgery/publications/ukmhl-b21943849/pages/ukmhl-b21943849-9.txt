PREFACE In recent years local anaesthesia has come much into use, especially in Germany. 1 ranee, and America. It has been shown that in minor, and to a less extent in major surgical operations it can often take the place of a general anaesthetic, and save the patient the risk and discomfort attending the administration of chloro- form or ether; while with its help many small but painful operations, often done without any anaesthetic, can be done painlessly. Owing to the fact that local anaesthesia has, till recently, been little used in this country, and that most work on the subject has been done by German, French, and American surgeons, knowledge of the possibilities attending its use, and of the various methods of inducing it, is by no means general. The following notes have been prepared in the hope that they may be of use in indicating the scope and limitations of infiltration, regional and spinal anaesthesia, at least to those who have neither time nor opportunity to study the extensive literature of these subjects for themselves.

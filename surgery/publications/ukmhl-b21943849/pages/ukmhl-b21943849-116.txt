104 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY lactate instead of cocaine acts weil when a tourniquet is used, but more slowly when no band is applied. The first effect of the injection is generally to pro- duce an immediate blanching of the finger due to the compression of the digital vessels; this soon passes off or merges into the more permanent ischaemia due to the action of the adrenalin, which appears in three to five minutes after the injection. This ischaemia lasts as long as an hour or even longer, while the anaesthesia lasts for at least two hours, and often much longer. As it passes off, a burning or tingling sensation is felt in the finger which may last for several hours. If a tourniquet has been tightly applied the burning may be replaced by severe reactionary pain in the finger. If a loosely applied band or none at all has been used, reactionary pain very rarely occurs. The action of the adrenalin, although strong enough to produce a marked ischcemia, is not strong enough to arrest the circulation in the finger completely, and if troublesome bleeding occurs after incisions are made, the rubber band may be reapplied sufficiently tightly to arrest it, but should not be left on longer than is absolutely necessary. The method may be summarised as follows:â€”Make a subcutaneous ring of cocaine- adrenalin solution at the base of a finger or toe by injecting from two dorsal punctures. Immediately apply a rubber band to produce a marked venous con- gestion in the finger. Wait ten minutes, remove the band, and the finger will be found completely amesthe- tised. If necessary, reapply the tourniquet tightly enough to completely arrest the circulation after the ansesthesia is complete and the venous congestion has passed off. Several digits may be anaesthetised at the same time by this method. 40 minims of the solution

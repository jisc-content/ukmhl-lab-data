LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY 66 Case XIX.—T. B„ cet. 70 years. Patient had had a wart on the left side of his tongue for four months The wart projected markedly from the tongue, and had long filiform processes of a whitish colour, suggesting an anemone in appearance. Its base measured § x \ inch. There was no sign of induration of the tongue substance. The tongue was infiltrated all round and below the wart. The tip of the tongue was transfixed with a silk thread and thereby steadied. The wart, with a surrounding area of mucous membrane, was then dis- sected off, and the raw surface occluded by stitching. There was no pain and no bleeding. Healing took place rapidly. . The two cases related are examples of what may be suitably done on the tongue under local anaesthesia. Only cases in which the lesion is small and within easy reach should he dealt with in this way. Lesions towards the back of the tongue cannot he satisfactorily treated under local anaesthesia, and attempts to dea with them in this way will only result in disappointment. Parotid Tumours.—Small, freely movable, supei- ficial parotid tumours may easily be removed under local anaesthesia. The tumours should be treated m the same way as a sebaceous cyst, and careful y rounded on all sides with a layer of solution. If there is the least doubt about the deptl to which the tumour goes or the possibility of adhesions rendering a tedious deep dissection necessary remov under local anaesthesia should not be attempted.

125 REGION A L A NsESTHESIA eight round the foot and ankle to arrest the circulation. Fifteen minutes later the edges of the small wound were excised, and a hap of skin and subcutaneous tissue reflected to expose the head of the metacarpal bone. When this was done a Gigli saw was passed into the joint and the prominent portion of the head of the meta- carpal bone removed. The toe was then straightened and the wound closed. Ten hours later after-pain came on and was severe for several hours. A hypo- dermic injection of morphia was given which relieved it, and it did not return. The wound suppurated, but eventually healed well, and the ultimate result of the operation was good. This or any other operation for hallux valgus can be easily done under local anaes- thesia induced by the above method. The cases related will serve as types of what has been termed combined regional and infiltration anees- thesia. It will be remarked that in three of them severe after-pain was felt. This is to be attributed partly to the fact that a tourniquet arresting the circulation was applied after making the injections in all the cases, and partly to the fact that the infiltrated tissues were either much inflamed at the time of opera- tion or had been inflamed shortly before. Subsequent experience has shown that either no tourniquet at all should be used or only a congesting band, in order to avoid severe after pain. The above method may be used with complete success on either hand or foot, but where there is much inflam- mation, with consequent thickening of the tissues and hypersensitiveness of the nerves, it may with advantage be replaced, for the hand at any rate, by perineural injections at the wrist, which are not in my experience followed by severe after-pain.

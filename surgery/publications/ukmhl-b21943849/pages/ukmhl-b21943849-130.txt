118 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY of middle finger, etc. Cocainisation of median, ulnar, and radial nerves at wrist. Using the same solution as in previous cases, 35 minims were injected round the median nerve, 70 minims round the branches of the radial nerve, and 35 minims round the ulnar nerve, by entering the needle on the ulnar aspect of the wrist between the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the bone, and pushing it on for nearly \ an inch, when the injection was made. No tourniquet was used. Forty minutes later the little finger was amputated through the middle phalanx, the wound of the middle finger cleansed and stitched, and a wound on the dorsum of the hand over the fifth metacarpal bone thoroughly cleansed. The whole operation was painless. The wounds healed without suppuration. I have, in a number of other cases, anaesthetised the median and radial nerves for amputation of the index finger, always with complete success, and there is no necessity to relate the cases in detail. It will be noted that in the cases related a long interval was always allowed for the cocaine to act, and that in some a con- gesting band was applied, in others not. As they were test cases it was desirable to give the cocaine full time to act. There was no apparent difference as regards after effects, when the congesting band was used and when it was not used, and although the exact amount by which the waiting after injections may be shortened by it has not yet been determined, it is probably wise to use it in all cases. The effect of the cocaine-suprarenin solution is some- times, strictly speaking, to produce analgesia,. not complete anaesthesia. During operation the patients feel that something is being done, and can sometimes recognise cutting, stitching, etc., but they say that the

74 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY on satisfactorily under local anaesthesia. Hernia of large size are not suitable, for the area of operation is so large that all parts of it cannot be sufficiently infiltrated without using a dangerous dose of cocaine or eucaine. Large herniae should therefQre be dealt with under general, or possibly under spinal anaesthesia if a general anaesthetic is contra-indicated. The advantages of operating under local anaesthesia are double. In the first place, the patient is spared the discomfort and risk of general anaesthesia. Although the risk is in reality not great, it undoubtedly exists, and many patients decline operation because of it. In the second place, the vomiting which so frequently follows the administration of chloroform or ether does not occur after local anaesthesia, and the strain on the stitches which vomiting causes is thus avoided. Against the use of local anaesthesia it is urged that an efficient radical cure cannot be done under it, and that the oedema caused by the injections is confusing and unnecessarily complicates the operation. The names of the surgeons who use local anaesthesia in operating on hernia is sufficient evidence that the first objection is groundless. Bassini’s operation or modifica- tions of it can be carried out in every detail under local anaesthesia. Failure to produce a satisfactory analgesia is the result of a faulty method of injection, and a very little practice will enable anyone who is anxious to use local anaesthesia to distribute the solution in such a way as to render the whole field of operation analgesic. Some experience, however, is undoubtedly necessary before the best results can be got, and one or two initial failures or partial failures should not discourage those who are inexperienced. Kocher’s and MacEwen’s operations are certainly less

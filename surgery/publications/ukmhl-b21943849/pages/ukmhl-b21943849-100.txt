88 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY remained entirely free from any sign of recurrence at that time. Case XXXI.â€”J. M., cet. 74 years. Patient had a right- sided hydrocele, the size of an orange, which had been tapped eleven times within the last two years, and he was anxious to get rid of it. 12 drachms of cocaine-adrenalin solution were injected as in the last case, an inguinal in- cision being again made. In ten minutes the hydrocele was gently pushed up by an assistant and made to bulge the line of incision in the groin. It was then exposed, partly freed, opened and emptied of fluid, and the whole sac with the testis was then easily delivered out of the wound ; the parietal tunica was dissected carefully from its coverings and cut off close to its reflection. One or two stitches were put in to fix the cut edges to the surrounding tissues, and all bleeding points tied. Chromic catgut was used to unite the deeper tissues and also the skin edges. One or two slight twinges of pain were felt when the edge of the cut tunica vaginalis was stitched to the surrounding tissue, otherwise the operation was entirely painless. After-pain came on two hours after operation and lasted five hours, but was not severe. Slight suppuration occurred round one of the deeper chromic gut sutures and delayed healing slightly. The ultimate result was excellent, and no sign of recurrence had appeared eleven months after the operation. I have operated on three other patients well over seventy years old for hydrocele, all of them more or less unsuitable subjects for general anaesthesia. There is no doubt that the substitution of local for general anaesthesia makes the performance of a radical cure in such cases a comparatively trivial and safe, instead of an unjustifiable, operation.

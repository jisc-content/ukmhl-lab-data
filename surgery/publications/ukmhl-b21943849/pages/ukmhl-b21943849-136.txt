124 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY Case XLIV.—R. L., male, cet. 19 years. For nine weeks before operation the patient had suffered from a tendon sheath whitlow of the right little finger. The wound healed, but the tendons were destroyed and the finger was in consequence flexed, stiff, and useless, and interfered very much with the patient’s work. Am- putation was therefore advised. \ per cent, cocaine- adrenalin solution was injected proximal to the operation line round the digital nerves, and the operation area it- self was then infiltrated with 1 in 900 cocaine-adrenalin solution.

Case XLV.—The next case, although not one of metacarpo-phalangeal amputation, illustrates how the operation for hallux valgus with bunion may be done on exactly the same lines. A.

A broad rubber bandage was then applied in a figure of

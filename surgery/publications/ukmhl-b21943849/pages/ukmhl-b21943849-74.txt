62 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA JN GENERAL SURGERY waiting twelve minutes the ganglion was exposed and opened. The jelly-like contents were stained brown, presumably by blood pigment from blood which bad escaped when the ganglion was punctured some months before. The wall of the ganglion was then cut away. No connection with any tendon was apparent, the ganglion lying apparently on the anterior annular ligament. The whole operation was painless, and was followed by moderate after-pain coming on three to four hours after the injections were made. The wound healed without suppuration. Bursal Enlargements.—Enlarged bursae, over the patella, the olecranon, etc., are best treated, if causing inconvenience, by excision under local anaesthesia. The usual rules must be followed in making the injec- tions, the solution being made to travel all over the bursa, between it and the skin, and then more deeply, especially round the base of the bursa, where it is in contact with the underlying aponeurosis or periosteum. Case XV.—Mrs S., cet. 52 years. Patient had an enlarged prepatellar bursa on the right knee, which caused her much inconvenience in her work as a housekeeper. The bursa measured 3x2 inches, and was filled with fluid, the walls being apparently not much thickened. Cocaine-adrenalin solution was in- jected ail over the bursa, between it and the skin, all round it, and a little finally injected on to the patella on the deep aspect of the bursa. 2 ounces = 1 grain of cocaine were used. In fifteen minutes the skin was incised, and the bursa dissected out. A little pain was felt as the bursa was dissected off the patella, apparently because enough solution had not been injected in this region. The pain was very slight and easily tolerated, although the patient was a nervous and excitable

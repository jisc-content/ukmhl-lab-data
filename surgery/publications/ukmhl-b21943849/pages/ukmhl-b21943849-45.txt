INFILTBA TION ANAESTHESIA 33 tissues operated on are completely infiltrated with the solution. It will be noted that Braun does not include morphia in his solution. He found in the course of his experi- ments that morphia had no local amesthetic action whatever, and had on the contrary a tendency to cause a troublesome after-oedema of the tissues. The con- tention of Schleich that the addition of morphia dimin- ishes the after-pain sometimes following injections he disputes, and maintains that in any case this could only be attributed to its action after absorption into the general circulation, for its local analgesic action is nil. If after-pain occurs, it is much better controlled by an ordinary hypodermic injection of morphia given at some other point than the seat of operation. It will thus be seen that while Schleich lays stress on the osmotic tension of the solvent of the cocaine in his solutions, maintaining that fluids of a particular osmotic tension have an important analgesic action independent to a certain extent of their chemical constition, Braun maintains that all solutions used fox- injection should be isotonic, partly because non-isotonic solutions are harmful, and partly because he believes that the analgesic power of weak cocaine solutions is almost, if not entirely, due to the chemical actioxx of the cocaine. It mattex’s little which view- is cox-x-ect, as fox- all practical purposes an effective analgesia can be pro- dxxced with solutions prepared in either way. Braun’s view, however, that the solutioxxs for injectioxx should be isotonic, or very nearly so, is generally accepted, and is very probably sound. It seems, therefore, ad- visable always to dissolve cocaixxe or other drxxgs xxsed for inducing analgesia in saline solution, aixd solution of the strength of 75 per cent, xneets all requirements 3

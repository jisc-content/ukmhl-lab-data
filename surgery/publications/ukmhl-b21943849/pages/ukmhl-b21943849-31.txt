19 DRUGS FOR LOCAL ANAESTHESIA be used where very large quantities of solution are likely to be required for infiltration. Both drugs may with advantage be combined with small doses of adrenalin. Eucaine possesses an advantage over cocaine in that its solutions may be boiled repeatedly without losing their analgesic power. Both drugs are unsuit- able for inducing spinal anaesthesia. Stovaine.—A recently introduced drug for inducing local anaesthesia, which has been definitely proved to be of value, is the hydrochlorate of amylene, termed stovaine. It is a synthetic product elaborated by Fourneau, a French chemist, and derived from tertiary amylic alcohol. It occurs as a white crystalline substance, freely soluble in water. Its solutions are fairly stable, and may be sterilised by boiling without undergoing chemical change. Experiments on animals have shown it to be less toxic than cocaine, and, as far as they have gone, clinical observations support the view that it is also less toxic in the human subject than cocaine. Pouchet,1 who experimented with sto- vaine soon after its discovery, found that it had feeble bactericidal properties. Bo far, stovaine has mainly been used by French observers, and reports on its use are not very numerous. Beclus,2 in a communication to the Academy of Medicine, reported that after nine months’ use of stovaine he was satisfied that the drug was almost, if not quite, equal to cocaine in analgesic power. He admitted the possibility of a slight differ- ence in the power of the two, “ mais c’est vraiment une difference infinitesimale, si elle existe, et la verite est que la stovaine vaut la cocaine.’’ 1 Pouchet, Bulletin cle VAcudinxie de Medccine, 12th June 1904. 2 P.

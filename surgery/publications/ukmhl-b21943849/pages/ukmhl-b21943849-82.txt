to local 'Anaesthesia in general surgery from the outer surface of the rib. An attempt may then be made to infiltrate the periosteum on the deep aspect of the rib. Whether this is successful or not, the periosteum may then be stripped in the ordinary way from the inner aspect of the rib. Pain is some- times felt during this, but not always. The rib when denuded of periosteum may be divided without pain, and the parietal pleura opened in the ordinary way. It is sometimes of value to give a hypodermic injection of morphia some minutes before beginning the operation when dealing with nervous patients. Case XXI.—A. B., male, cet. 32 years, suffering from chronic empyema on the right side, associated with phthisis. The pleural cavity had been aspirated several times, and a discharging sinus was present in the seventh interspace in the mid axillary line. The whole of the right side was dull on percussion, and the patient’s breathing was considerably embarrassed. The patient was given | grain of morphia hypodermically a few minutes before coming into the operating theatre. Cocaine-adrenalin solution was injected all along the line of proposed incision over the seventh rib just above the sinus, first subcutaneously, then deeply on to the periosteum, and along the edges of the seventh rib. In fifteen minutes the incision was made and a portion. of rib removed in the ordinary way. The pleural cavity was then opened and 105 ounces of pus escaped. The cavity was explored with the finger, but the collapsed lung could not be felt. Two large drainage tubes were introduced, and the patient sent back to bed. No pain whatever was felt during the operation. The patient was much relieved, but died some months later of phthisis. . Case XXII.—R. L., male, at. 21 years, suffering from

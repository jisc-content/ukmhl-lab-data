INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 89 Cysts of Epididymis—Cysts of Cord.—These may be treated exactly as hydroceles. Infiltrate the line of incision, the cord above the cyst, and the tissue round the cyst. Expose and dissect out the cyst wall. Case XXXII.—T. G., cet. 57 years. Patient had a cyst of the epididymis, which had been present for two years and was growing slowly and causing slight discomfort. Solution containing 1 grain of cocaine, 1 grain of eucaine, and 12 drops of suprarenin to 3 ounces of sterile saline solution was used. This was injected over and round the cyst in the upper part of the scrotum and into the cord. About 12 drachms were used = | grain of cocaine and J grain of eucaine. In fifteen minutes a scrotal incision was made and the cyst and tunica vaginalis exposed. A small quantity of fluid was found in the tunica vaginalis, which was opened and its parietal layer partly cut away. The cyst in the globus major was then opened and its wall clipped away. Bleeding points were tied and the wound closed without drainage. The whole operation was quite painless. After-pain was slight. The wound healed by first intention. The cyst fluid contained numerous spermatozoa. Castration.—Here again an inguinal or scrotal in- cision may be used. The tissues under the skin incision, the cord itself, and the tissues round the testis and tunica vaginalis must be infiltrated. Special attention must be directed to the cord, which should be exposed where it is to be divided in the first place, and if infiltra- tion has not been successfully carried out from the oiiginal punctures the cord with its nerves must be carefully treated, and some minutes given for the solu- tion to act. The cord may then be divided and ligatured, the testis drawn up by the portion of cord left attached

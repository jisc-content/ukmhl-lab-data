no LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY which are usually seen at this level. Hold the syringe at right angles to the long axis of the forearm, and push the needle through the deep fascia, under the palmaris tendon, obliquely towards the radius for 1| c.cm. of an inch), so that its point comes to lie about under the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis. While entering and withdrawing the needle, inject 1 c.cm. of 1 per cent., or better, 2 c.cm. of Â£ per cent, cocaine solution, with 3 drops of suprarenin 1 in 1000 under the fascia. The ulnar nerve may be reached at the same level by entering the needle on the ulnar aspect of the forearm, between the ulna and the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and pushing it for l|-2 c.cm. under the tendon, the same quantity of solution as for the median being injected, again only under the deep fascia. There is, according to Braun, no danger of wounding the ulnar vessels if this plan is followed. The nerve may, however, be more easily, and probably more safely reached behind the internal condyle, where it can readily be fixed against the bone by the finger or thumb of the left hand, while the cocaine-suprarenin solution is injected into or round it with the right. All the terminal twigs of the radial nerve can be easily paralysed by injecting a strip of cocaine-suprarenin solution subcutaneously, just above the styloid process of the radius, from immediately outside the radial artery to the middle of the dorsal aspect of the wrist, and 2-3 c.cm. of | per cent, cocaine solution with 3-5 drops of suprarenin may be used for this. The palmar cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves may be interrupted by a similar subcutaneous injection across the front of the wrist, or the whole of the subcutaneous nerve twigs passing from the wrist to the hand may be interrupted by infiltrating thor-

6 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY tion, the cocaine acted more quickly, more powerfully, and for a very much longer time than if no band were applied. The resulting ansesthesia was absolute. It was also found that the risk of the absorption of the cocaine into the general circulation with resulting un- pleasant symptoms was very much lessened Braun in some experimental observations, found that an otherwise lethal dose of cocaine injected into the leg of a rabbit after a tourniquet had been put on, had little or no toxic effect if the tourniquet were allowed to remain for half an hour after the injection had been made. He supposes that the cocaine combines in some way with the tissues during the arrest of the circulation, and is not set free in its original form when the blood is allowed to enter the part again. Another possible explanation is, that the cocaine is released so slowly after the circulation begins again that elimination begins before a toxic dose accumulates in the system, and goes on quickly enough to prevent any such ac- cumulation. Whatever the explanation, there is no doubt of the fact that arrest of the circulation by tourniquet markedly increases tbe analgesic power of cocaine, and advantage can frequently be taken of it in operating on the hand and arm or foot and leg under local ansesthesia. Another and more generally applicable method of increasing the local action of cocaine, and at the same time diminishing its general toxicity, is to inject along with it the active principle of the suprarenal gland. To Braun1 belongs tbe credit of having recognised the 1 H.

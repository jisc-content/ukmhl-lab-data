37 1NFILTRA TION ANAESTHESIA No. 3. Cocaine hydrochloride, . . .1 grain. Encaine lactate, .... 1 grain. Solution adrenalin chloride (1 in 1000), . 12 drops. Solution sodium chloride ('75 per cent.), . 3 ounces. These solutions, particularly solution 1, are recom- mended because they have been thoroughly tested and found satisfactory. Looking to the fact that it is diffi- cult to produce an absolutely perfect anaesthesia by infiltration, it seems to me that the strongest solution which can be used with complete safety should always be used. After testing various strengths of solution, I have found that with solution 1 most operations can be done with a dose of cocaine well within the limits of safety, while it is strong enough to produce a most satis- factory anaesthesia if properly used. It may be prepared by pouring 2 ounces of warm sterilised salt solution into an aseptic wide-mouthed measure glass, graduated in drachms and ounces, and adding a 1 grain tablet of cocaine and 12 drops of adrenalin chloride, 1 in 1000, to the solution. Solution 1 is recommended for general use : as much as 4 ounces of it may, I believe, be safely used. Solu- tion 2 is recommended for those who prefer to use eucaine instead of cocaine. It may also be used when it is anticipated that a very large quantity of solution will be required for any operation and it is desired to avoid using a possibly toxic dose of cocaine. Solution 3 com- bines to a certain extent the advantages of cocaine and eucaine. It acts almost as quickly aud as powerfully as a pure cocaine solution, and allows of the use of 3 ounces of solution without using more than 1 grain of cocaine, a dose which some do not care to exceed. The metric system has purposely been avoided in the recipes for

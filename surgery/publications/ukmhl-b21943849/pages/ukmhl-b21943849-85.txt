INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 73 probably wise never to attempt this without general anaesthesia, unless general anaesthesia is absolutely con- tra-indicated. The impossibility of foretelling accurately the condition, situation, and relations of the appendix makes it necessary, if the best work is to be done, that the surgeon should not be hampered in any way in his manipulations, as he undoubtedly is when operating under local anesthesia in such cases. For the other ab- dominal operations mentioned it is also wise to restrict the use of local anaesthesia to those cases in which it is specially desirable to avoid using chloroform or ether. Disappointment and tedious delay in giving a general anaesthetic after an operation is begun will thus be often avoided, and in the majority of cases the best interests of the patient and operator promoted. Hernia.—With many cases of hernia, particularly inguinal hernia, it is quite otherwise. Here the field of operation is superficial, can be accurately defined before operation, and all parts of it can be readily reached with the injecting needle before or during the operation. Although the use of local anaesthesia for the radical cure of hernia or the relief of strangulated hernia is by no means general, there is not the least doubt that many cases can be efficiently operated on under it. Cushing, Lennander, Eeclus, Schleich, Braun, Barker, and many other surgeons of repute have shown this. Before the introduction of adrenalin, Schleich’s and Reclus’ methods were used with success. With cocaine-adrenalin or eucaine-adrenalin solutions a satis- factory analgesia can be obtained more easily than by either of the older plans. Hernise of small or moderate size, in adults of both sexes, of the inguinal, femoral, or umbilical variety, reducible, irreducible, or strangulated, can be operated

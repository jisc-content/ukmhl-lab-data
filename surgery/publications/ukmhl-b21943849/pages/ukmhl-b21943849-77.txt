INFILTRATION ANESTHESIA OPERATIONS 65 the lesion occupies a lateral position, the solution may be introduced all round it without including the whole breadth of the tongue. Enough solution should be in- troduced to produce a moderate uniform swelling of the part infiltrated. During the injections the tongue should be steadied by gently grasping it at the tip with a dry gauze swab. In ten minutes incisions may be made painlessly through the infiltrated portion. To steady the tongue during operation it is well to introduce one or two stout silk threads through the infiltrated part, outside the line of proposed incision. With these the tongue may be steadied without being too strongly pulled on and without hurting the patient in any way. Case XVIII.—Removed of the tip of the tongue.—J. B. cet. 68 years. The patient presented himself with a superficial ulcer, 1 inch long, on the tip of the tongue, which had been present for eight weeks and refused to heal. There was no history or other indication of syphilis, no induration of the base or edges of the ulcer, and no enlarged glands could be felt. A thorough course of treatment with iodide of potassium and careful mouth cleansing, in hospital, produced no improvement, and removal of the ulcer was decided on. The point of the tongue was infiltrated with cocaine-adrenalin solution well beyond the ulcer. Two silk threads were then passed through the tongue to either side of the ulcer, and the ulcer with a surrounding margin of healthy tissue lemoved with scissors. The raw edges were then brought together with chromic catgut stitches. The whole operation was painless. 5 drachms of solution were used. Healing took place slowly, but completely, and six months later the patient was in perfect health. Micioscopic examination of the ulcer showed no malig- nant or specific appearances of any kind. 5

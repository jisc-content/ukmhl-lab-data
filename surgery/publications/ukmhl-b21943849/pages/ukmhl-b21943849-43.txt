31 INFIL TRA TION A NJR8THESIA as “ Schleich’a solution.” Nos. 1 and 3 are only used in exceptional cases. No. 1 for hypothetic tissues and No. 3 for occasions when very large quantities oi solution are required in comparatively insensitive parts. Other observers, notably Braun, maintained that the analgesic power oi Schleich’s solutions depended entirely on their cocaine content. Braun repeated and amplified Schleich’s experiments, and maintained, what seems to be very generally admitted, that the use of non-isotomc solutions for injection is not only useless but harmful, FARALYStS Fig. 1.—Diagram (after Braun). To illustrate the effect of endermic injections of different strengths of NaCl solution, referred to in the text. for they irritate the tissues and lower their vitality, and so tend to interfere with healing, and possibly even cause sloughing. Heterotonic solutions of certain strengths do produce slight analgesia, but only after acting as irritants, and the slight analgesic power they possess is of no practical value in inducing effective local analgesia for surgical operations. Their analgesic power is in direct proportion to their irritating pro- perties, a point which Braun established and depicted graphically in the accompanying diagram (fig. 1). Along the line A.B. are indicated the percentage

Both writers, however, found that a firmly applied tourniquet was necessary in order to localise the cocaine, and intensify its action, and that it caused great discomfort and often pain, and attempts to extend the use of perineural cocaine injections beyond the digits led to no really satisfactory results till the discovery that adrenalin greatly intensified the local action of cocaine, and to a large extent obviated the need for using a firmly applied tourniquet, was made. Braun, as noted above, has carefully studied the effects of perineural cocaine-suprarenin injections, and I propose to quote the directions he gives for antes- thetising some of the nerve areas supplied by the main nerves of the forearm and leg. His observations have, I believe, resulted in the development of a really practical method of antesthetising part or the whole of the hand, but the arrangement of the nerves supplying the foot makes the problem of reaching them all easily and safely with cocaine injections a little complicated, and it is as yet doubtful whether his observations will lead to very practical results in the surgery of the lower limb. If spinal anaesthesia with stovaine proves to be as innocuous as its advocates claim, it will pro- bably be the method of choice for operations unsuitable for infiltration antesthesia, and where general antesthesia is undesirable.

INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 55 injected round and below the ulcer. In ten minutes the ulcer, with a surrounding margin of healthy skin, was painlessly removed, and the edges brought together with stitches. Case IX.—A. B., sailor, cet. 51 years. The patient had a circular, ulcerated, fungating epithelioma, about 1 inch in diameter, on the left temporal region at the hair margin, no evident glandular involvement. About 4 drachms of cocaine-adrenalin solution were injected round and under the tumour. Twenty minutes later the tumour was fully excised. One or two slight twinges of pain were felt during the operation. Con- siderable difficulty was found in making the injection travel in the dense subcutaneous tissue of the scalp. The injection had to be made slowly, under considerable pressure. Removal of Sebaceous and Dermoid Cysts and Subcutaneous Tumours.—In removing cysts or tumours from the subcutaneous tissue the cocaine solution should be distributed carefully all round, below, and above the cyst or tumour. It is well to make the injections on a definite plan, beginning say by completely surrounding the cyst or tumour with a ring of solution in the subcutaneous tissue, then pass- ing the needle below it and injecting there, and finally injecting solution between it and the overlying skin. In this way all the tissue to be cut through is infil- trated with solution. Except when very small cysts are being removed, several punctures are required in making the necessary injections. Case X.—X. Y., male, cet. 80 years. The patient had three sebaceous cysts on the vertex: one as big as a walnut, the others about the size of hazel nuts. A ring of cocaine-adrenalin solution was made in the sub-

DRUGS FOR LOCAL ANESTHESIA 3 the solutions with it. Great care must be taken to avoid introducing any alkali into the solutions, for the cocaine is thereby rendered inert. Instruments which have been boiled in soda solution must, therefore, not be used to stir the cocaine mixture, and syringes and needles to be used for injecting the cocaine must be boiled in plain water or physiological salt solution. This precaution must also be observed in using eucaine B and stovaine'. When injected hypodermically, cocaine acts power- fully as a local anaesthetic. A \ per cent, solution injected into a nerve trunk causes an almost immediate physiological block on the nerve, the conduction of afferent or efferent impulses being completely arrested. Operations in the area of distribution of the ailected nerve may be done without pain and, what is important in some cases, without shock, the block lasting long enough for the performance of any ordinary surgical operation. Crile,1 in a long series of experiments on animals, and by clinical observations on patients, proved that while afferent impulses from the area of operation caused shock when general amesthesia was used, blocking of the nerves supplying an operation area by cocaine, effectually prevented the transmission of such impulses. When employing this method clinically, he was able to amputate the leg after cocainising the anterior crural and sciatic nerves, to amputate through the arm at the shoulder joint, and to remove half the shoulder girdle with the arm, by cocainising the trunks forming the brachial plexus, all painlessly and without shock. The same effects may in some cases be obtained by 1 G. W. Crile, Problems relating to Surgical Operations, J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1901.

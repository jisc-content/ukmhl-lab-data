SPINAL ANAESTHESIA 129 a line joining their highest points taken. This line crosses the 4th lumbar spine. The lumbar spines above are then made out, and the injection is made between the 2nd and 3rd or 1st and 2nd spines (probably best between the 2nd and 3rd, for the cord may reach a little below the 1st lumbar body). The trocar and cannula are then entered between two spines, exactly in the middle line, the site of puncture being frozen by ethyl chloride in nervous patients. When the skin is pierced, the trocar is withdrawn and the cannula pushed forwards and slightly upwards, exactly in the middle line, till the subarachnoid space is entered and cerebro- spinal fluid escapes. The subarachnoid space may be entered at a distance of 4-10 cm. from the surface. If no cerebro-spinal fluid escapes through the cannula, another puncture at a different level should be made: and if this also fails to tap the subarachnoid space injection must not be made. In the absence of definite evidence of the needle having entered the subarachnoid space, which is only given by the escape of cerebro- spinal fluid, injection of stovaine will almost certainly fail to produce anaesthesia, and is therefore useless. The fluid should escape freely, in a steady jet, not drop by drop. If it escapes drop by drop the cannula should ie moved about a very little, or very slightly moved on or back, to try and get the fluid to flow freely. As soon as this occurs the stovaine should be injected, 1-H c.cm of a 4 per cent, solution, with the addition of "a few drops of sterile 1 in 1000 solution of the adrenal active principle, being mixed with the fluid. The injection should be made slowly, and after it is made 1 or 2 ccm of cerebro-spinal fluid may be withdrawn into â€˜the syringe and reinjected, to avoid leaving any appreciable quantity of stovaine m the cannula or syringe.

INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA OPERATIONS 47 general rules can be laid down, and everyone must judge for herself or himself as to whether local or general anaesthesia should be employed in any given operation. Speaking generally, it may be said that the operations which may suitably be done under local anaesthesia are those in which the field of operation is comparatively limited, comparatively superficial, and in which its limits can be outlined with certainty before the operation is begun. Operations in deeply seated tissues, on tumours, etc., of uncertain extent and attachments are unsuitable for local anaesthesia, and if it is used in such cases the almost invariable result is either the infliction of severe pain on the patient, or the performance of an incomplete and therefore bad operation. The removal of apparently isolated and superficial tubercular glands in the neck or elsewhere may be cited as a typical illustration of a class of cases where there is often a temptation to use local iustead of general anaesthesia, and where local anaesthesia should rarely or never be used. Very moderate experience is enough to teach that the extent of such operations can very rarely be defined before the parts are exposed, that deep dissections involving important vessels are often unexpectedly necessary, making the field of operation larger than was anticipated, and so complicated that all parts of it cannot be rendered anaesthetic by injections of cocaine. The same remarks apply with even greater force to the removal of glands infected with malignant disease. In estimating the possibilities attending the use of local anaesthesia it must be borne in mind that the sensibility of different tissues in the body varies greatly. The subcutaneous fat, muscles, tendons, and fasciae are very much less sensitive to pain than the skin, and are, in fact, peiâ€¢ se, almost insensitive, for surgical purposes at

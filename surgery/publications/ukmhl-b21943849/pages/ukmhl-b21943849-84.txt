72 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY be rendered analgesic by infiltration with cocaine- adrenalin solution, and the abdomen may then be painlessly opened. Any operation which does not in- volve handling or dragging on the parietal peritoneum can then be done without paining the patient. The number of such operations is obviously limited, and gastrostomy and colostomy have been selected as perhaps the most typical of these. The whole length of the abdominal incision must be carefully infiltrated with cocaine-adrenalin solution, first, the subcutaneous tissue, then the muscular or aponeurotic layer, and lastly, the extra-peritoneal tissue. Should it be found on dividing the muscles or linea alba that the extra-peritoneal tissue has not been successfully infiltrated, this should be done before dividing it, and the solution should be spread to either side of the incision line as far as possible to allow of the application of retractors if necessary. The manipulations necessary in doing a simple gas- trostomy, colostomy, intestinal anastomosis, resection of intestine, appendicectomy, ovariotomy, etc., can be carried out without causing the patient pain or serious discomfort. The routine adoption of this method is not advisable, even when a simple operation is anticipated, for it is often found on opening the abdomen that the viscera are not so easily reached as was expected; in- cisions have often to be enlarged, forcible retraction of wound edges to be employed, and adhesions involving the parietal peritoneum to be dealt with. In these circumstances a general anaesthetic has to be given to allow of the operation being carefully and thoroughly done. In no operation is the unexpected more often met with perhaps than in appendicectomy. Although cases have been reported where the appendix has been successfully removed under local anaesthesia, it is

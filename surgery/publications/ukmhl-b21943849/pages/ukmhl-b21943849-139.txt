SPINAL ANESTHESIA 127 reported, and it became evident that spinal amesthesia induced by cocaine was neither safer nor pleasanter for the patient than general anaesthesia induced by chloro- form or ether. Zahradnicky1 collected 4659 cases in 1902. In 212 of these, anaesthesia was incomplete or entirely absent; in 58, dangerous complications accom- panied or followed its use ; in 12, death followed its use, eleven times when cocaine was used, once when eucaine was used. These figures show conclusively that spinal anaesthesia with cocaine or eucaine is even more dangerous than general anaesthesia with chloroform, and that there is no justification for its use. Bier himself and the great majority of other surgeons accordingly gave it up, but its use was continued in Trance, notably by Tuffier, who maintained that it was, when properly carried out, safe and satisfactory. After the introduction of adrenalin, and the discovery of the comparative safety of cocaine-adrenalin injections as compared with injections of cocaine alone, Bier again took up the subject and got much better results than before. Many other surgeons confirmed his lesults, and spinal anaesthesia, induced by cocaine- adrenalin injections, was shown at any rate to be com- paratively safe. Complications during and after its use were, however, by no means abolished by the adrenalin. A certain degree of collapse, uncontrollable tremor in the legs, profuse perspiration, nausea, vomiting, and ieelings of great oppression and precordial distress frequently supervened soon after the injections, and headache, neuralgic pains, and fever were also frequent after effects. These effects were attributed to the specially powerful action of cocaine when brought into direct contact with the central nervous system, 1 Zahradnicky, Wiener medidnische Wochensc/inft, 1902, Nos. 44-47.

DRUGS FUR LOCAL ANAESTHESIA 13 errs on the side of extreme caution, for others have found that in 1 in 1000 solution a good deal more than 5 centigrammes may be injected without the least fear of symptoms of intoxication arising. The dose named by Iieclus, on the other hand, is considerably larger than that recommended by anyone else, and although his large experience entitles him to express a positive opinion which cannot be lightly set aside, one is inclined to regard 20 centigrammes (3 grains) in \ per cent, solution as a large dose, which certainly verges on the dangerous. It is to be noted, however, that all these doses were fixed before the introduction of adrenalin, and it has been amply demonstrated that the combination of adrenalin with cocaine markedly diminishes the general toxic action of the drug, and therefore allows of the use of larger doses with safety. Exactly how far the dose may be increased by this means it is difficult to say, but it is probably well within the mark to put the safe dose of cocaine in | per cent, solution at 1 grain, and in 1 in 1000 solution at 2 grains. As a matter of fact, it will be found that the great majority of operations which can be suitably done under local anaesthesia can be done with smaller doses than those suggested, so that the question of the maximum safe dose rarely arises. I have ou several occasions used as much as 2 grains of cocaine in 1 in 1000 solution, but have never found it necessary to use more. Eucaine.-—Eucaine is the name given to the synthetic product benzoyl-vinyidiaceton-alkamin, discovered by Merling, and first studied by Vinci in Liebreich’s laboratory. Two forms of the drug were for some time used, known respectively as eucaine A and B, but it was

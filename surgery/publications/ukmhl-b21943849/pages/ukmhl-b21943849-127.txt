lift REGION A L A NAS,s' THE SI A patient felt something enter the palm of her left hand, and since then had had a sharp jagging pain in the hand when she grasped anything firmly. With the help of the X-rays two pieces of a broken needle were located in the hypothenar eminence, one embedded in the muscles close to the metacarpal bone, the other lying close to the skin. Only one of them could be detected by palpation. 35 drops of a solution containing 1 grain of cocaine, 8 drops of suprarenin, and 4 drachms of saline solution, i.e. a solution containing slightly less than | per cent, of cocaine, were injected into and round the ulnar nerve behind the internal condyle, the nerve being fixed against the bone by the left thumb while the injection into and round it was made. When the needle entered the nerve, a tingling feeling was felt in the distribution of the ulnar nerve, described by the patient as being like an electric shock. Immediately after the injection a broad rubber band was applied round the upper arm tightly enough to produce a venous congestion, but not to arrest the arterial flow. Twenty minutes later this band was removed and an incision was made on the ulnar side of the hand into the hypo- thenar eminence, and after dissecting through the muscles one piece of the needle was found lying up against the metacarpal bone. The other piece^was found under the skin, superficial to the muscles. The operation took about twenty minutes, as the pieces of needle were difficult to find. When the incision was first made bleeding was free, and the rubber band was reapplied at the wrist to arrest the circulation completely m the hand. The wound was closed without drainage. he whole operation was absolutely painless. The patient said that she felt something going on, and recog- nised that something was being cut, but the sensation

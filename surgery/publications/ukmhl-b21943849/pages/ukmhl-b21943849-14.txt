2 LOCAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY to litmus. It is said to be sometimes contaminated with other alkaloids from the same plant which have undesirable properties, and, therefore, it is essential, in order to ensure the best results from its use, to procure the drug from a reliable source. Of the various tests which may be employed to detect impurities, the most generally useful and easily applied appear to be Mac- lagan’s and the potassium permanganate test. Mac- lagan’s test is as follows:—1 grain of cocaine hydro- chloride is dissolved in 2 fluid ounces of water. To this is added 3 drops of solution of ammonia (B.P.), and the mixture is stirred with a glass rod. In a few minutes a crystalline precipitate is thrown down, leaving no turbidity in the supernatant liquid. The peimanganate test is carried out as follows:—A a cubic centimetre of j^th per cent, solution of potassium per- manganate is added to jL-th gramme of cocaine hydro- chloride dissolved in 5 cubic centimetres of water, acidi- fied with sulphuric acid. The colour should not disappear within an hour. If solutions of cocaine are kept for long or heated to boiling point, the cocaine is apt to break up into the inert alkaloid ekgonin and other compounds, and there- fore solutions should invariably be freshly prepared just before use, and should not be sterilised by boiling. Some observers affirm that fresh solutions may be boiled for a short time without any ill effect, but there is some uncertainty on this point, and, as a matter of fact, if the drug is handled with ordinary care, it is unnecessary to boil the solutions after they are made up. Cocaine may be kept in tablet form or in powder, and if it is transferred with clean hands or instruments to freshly boiled, normal saline solution, no fear need be enter- tained that pathogenic organisms will be introduced into

4 LOGAL ANAESTHESIA IN GENERAL SURGERY injecting cocaine or cocaine-adrenalin solutions into the immediate neighbourhood of nerve trunks, which can be easily located and reached through the skin. Braun 1 of Leipzig has devoted special attention to this method of producing anaesthesia, and has been able to reach the median, ulnar, radial, external popliteal, and other nerves in this way, using solutions of 1 per cent, or i per cent, strength, combined with suprarenin or other preparation of the active principle of the supra- renal gland. The anaesthesia produced in this way is generally termed regional anaesthesia. When cocaine solutions are injected into the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the actual site of an opera- tion, so as to infiltrate more or less completely the whole field of operation, analgesia is readily produced by solutions varying in strength from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000, or even weaker. The cocaine acts on the nerve endings or the finer nerve twigs, large nerve trunks being practically unaffected, at least by the weaker solutions. The term analgesia is deliberately used here instead of anaesthesia, because absolute anaesthesia is not always produced by infiltration of the tissues. Many patients retain the sense of touch in the field of opera- tion, and can tell when a knife is being used and when stitches are being put in, etc., these procedures, however, not causing any pain. The term “ infiltration anaes- thesia ” is generally used in describing the effects of purely local cocaine injections. The strength of the various solutions which may be used will be indicated more fully later, but it may be said here that the use of any solution containing more 1 H.

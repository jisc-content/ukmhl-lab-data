INFILTRATION ANAESTHESIA 27 described above, 8 c.m. long. A second is then made m the subcutaneous fat, special attention being paid to the region of the external abdominal ring. The skin and cellular tissue are then divided down to the external oblique aponeurosis. The external ring is defined. The needle is then insinuated under the aponeurosis into the transversalis and internal oblique muscles, and these are anaesthetised. Before cutting down to the internal ring some of the solution is injected along the length of the cord and to its right and left, one syringeful sufficing for this. After dividing the external oblique aponeurosis to the internal ring, the sac is isolated. Should any firm adhesions between it and the surrounding tissues be found, these may be injected as they are met with. When the sac is isolated, and before opening it, two syringefuls of solution may be injected into it to anaesthetise the peritoneum, and any contents which may be in the sac. The sac is then opened, the contents reduced, and the sac tied and removed below the ligature. The canal is strengthened by Bassini s method and the wound closed. This description will serve to illustrate the chief points in M. Reclus' method. Each layer of tissue must be treated sepa- rately, successive layers being dealt with as they are exposed. Therefore, repeated injections are necessary in any operation involving tissues deeper than the subcutaneous fat. It is also necessary to incise exactly in the line of the injections made, and conversely to inject exactly along the line of proposed incision. It is further necessary to be careful when inserting stitches not to insert the needle beyond the narrow analgesic band, 1, or at most, 2 c.m. broad, produced by the injections. The method thus requires great care and precision. With practice excellent results may be

33 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. process, for the insertion of the temporal muscle, and a posterior, or condyle, for articulation with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. Where the ascending ramus joins the body of the bone almost a right angle is formed, and here the masseter and internal pterygoid muscles are inserted. On the inner surface of the ramus is the inferior dented foramen, communicating with the canal below the sockets for the teeth in which lie the nerves and blood-vessels for the teeth. The Hyoid bone lies in the neck, a little below the inferior maxilla (figs. 6 and 7). It is shaped like the letter U, and consists of a body, or basi-hyal, from which two great cornua or thyro-hyeds project backwards. At the junction of the body and great horns two smaller cornua, or cerato-hycds, project upwards, and are connected with the styloid processes of the temporal bones, or stylo-hyals, by the stylo-hyoid ligaments, or epi-hyeds. The hyoid gives origin to the muscles of the tongue, and lies above the thyroid carti- lage of the larynx, to which it is attached by ligaments. In its general form the Skull is ovoid, with the long axis extending antero-posteriorly, the frontal and occipital ends rounded, and the sides somewhat flattened. Its average length in the people of the British Islands is a little more than 7 inches ; its greatest breadth about 5^ inches ; and its height, from the plane of the foramen magnum to the vertex, about 5^ inches. Its greatest circumference is about 21 inches. The breadth of the face across the zygomatic arches is about 5 iuches. The average capacity of the brain cavity is 92 cubic inches. The British skull is mesati-cephalic and orthognathic.1 1 Human Crania may be arranged in three groups according to their proportion of length and breadth. When the breadth is to the length less than 75 to 100 they are dolico-ceplialic ; when between 75 and 80 to 100, mesati-cephalic ; when more than 80 to 100, braohy-cephalic. C

345 THE EYEBALL. numerous fusiform cells, with relatively large nuclei, the so-callecl internal granules, arranged in superimposed strata; from each fusiform cell a fibre proceeds in two directions, one centrally into the internal molecular layer, and one peripherally into the external molecular layer. These fibres possess varicosities, and resemble the optic nerve fibres. The external molecular or granulated layer (6) is very thin, and consists of an expanded network of minute fibres, with nuclei situated at the points of intersection of the fibres. Krause has called it the membrana fenestrata. The external granule or nuclear layer (7) contains numer- ous fusiform cells with relatively large nuclei, the so-called external granules, arranged in superimposed strata: from each enlargement a fibre proceeds in two directions, one centrally into the external molecular layer, and one peripherally through the membrana limitans externa into the bacillary layer, where it becomes continuous with the anterior end of either a rod or a cone, as the case may be. Hence these fibres of the external granule layer are called by Schultze rod and cone fibres, and the external granules are nuclei in these fibre-like cells. The fibres possess varicosities like those of the internal nuclear layer. In man the nuclei of the cone fibres are transversely striped and close to the membrana limitans externa, and those of the rod fibres are clear and in the deeper strata. The bacillary layer (9), or membrane of Jacob, consists of multitudes of elongated bodies arranged side by side like rows of palisades, and vertically to the surfaces of the retina. Some of these bodies are cylindrical, and are named the rods of the retina; others are flask-shaped, and named the cones of the retina : the rods equal in length the entire thickness of the bacillary layer; the cones are shorter than the rods, and are interspersed at regular intervals

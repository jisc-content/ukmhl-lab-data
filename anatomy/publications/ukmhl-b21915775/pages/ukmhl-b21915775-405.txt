THE SKIN. 389 to the cutis, and has been described as arranged in three layers, the external, middle, and inner layer of the hair follicle. The external and middle layers are formed of connective tissue, with blood-vessels; whilst the inner, sometimes called the vitreous layer, is transparent and homogeneous, and continuous with the so-called basement membrane of the cutis. The inner part of the wall of the hair follicle, or the root-slieath, belongs to the cuticle, and consists of two layers, the outer and inner root-sheaths. The outer root-slieatli is continuous with the rete Malpighii, and consists of layers of cells similar to those of that stratum. The inner root-slieath is continuous with the horny stratum of the cuticle, and consists of layers of cells; those of its outer layer are flattened and non-nucleated; those of its middle layer, which form the sheath of Huxley, are polyhedral and nucleated, whilst those of the inner layer are non-nucleated, elongated, and flattened. A hair possesses a root, a shaft, and a tip; the root is imbedded in the hair follicle, whilst the shaft and tip form the free projecting part of the hair. The hair is invested by imbricated scale-like cells, which form the hair cuticle. The substance of the human hair is composed of a fibrous- looking horny material, which by the action of strong sulphuric acid is resolved into elongated, closely compacted, fusiform cells, which in coloured hairs contain pigment granules. In the thicker hairs the cells in the axis of the hair are polygonal, contain air, and form a central pith or medulla. Tn different animals the size and relative pro- portion of the cells of the cuticle, medulla, and fibrous part of the hair present many modifications. The wool of the sheep has its cuticle scales, with well-defined serrated mar- gins, so that the hair of this animal is well adapted for felting into cloth; in the bat, also, the cuticle cells ar

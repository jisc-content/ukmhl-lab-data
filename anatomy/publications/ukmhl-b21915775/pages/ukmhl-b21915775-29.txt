AXIAL SKELETON—SPINE. 13 large : the superior articular processes look upwards. The 7th, or Vertebra prominens, has a long prominent spine, which is not bifid, and a small foramen at the root of the transverse process. In the human spine the distinguishing character of all the cervical vertebrae is the foramen at the root of the transverse process, but amongst mammals this is not an invariable character, for in the cetacea the trans- verse process of the atlas is imperforate, and in the horse, ruminants, and many quadrumana, the 7th cervical vertebra has no foramen at the root of its transverse process. The Dorsal Vertebrae, more appropriately called Costal or Thoracic, are twelve in number in the human spine; but amongst mammals they range from eleven in the armadillo to twenty-two in the Cape hyrax and Hoffmann’s sloth. They are intermediate in size and position to the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, and the distinguishing char- acter is one or two smooth surfaces on each side of the body for articulation with the head of one or two ribs. The body is heart-shaped : the arch is short and with imbricated laminae: the ring is nearly circular: the spine is oblique, elongated, and bayonet-shaped : the transverse processes are directed back and out, not bifid, and with an articular surface in front for the tubercle of a rib : the articular processes are flat and nearly vertical: the superior notches shallow, the inferior deep. The 1st, 12th, 11th, 10th, and sometimes the 9th, dorsal vertebrae are characteristic. The 1st is in shape like the 7th cervical, but has no foramen at the root of the transverse process, and has two articular facets on each side of the body. The 9th has sometimes only one facet at the side of the body. The 10th, 11th, and 12 th have invariably only a single facet on each side of the body, and their spines approximate in shape to those of

THE BLOOD. 125 /\\ in the blood of all mammals are non-nucleated and bicon- cave, and in all, except the tribe of camels, they are circular discs; but in the camels they are elliptical. An appearance of nucleation has been seen in exceptional individual cases ; for Rolleston saw it in a small proportion of the dried red blood corpuscles of a two-toed sloth; and I have observed in a proportion of the red blood discs of a Hoffmann’s sloth an appearance of a central nucleus. In all birds, reptiles, amphibia, and most fishes the red corpuscles are oval or elliptical, nucleated and biconvex (2, 4, 5, fig. 28). In the Cyclostomatous fishes the red corpuscles are circular discs. The red corpuscles vary materially in size in different vertebrata, and these variations have been especially studied by Gulliver. He has found them Fio. 28.—1, red corpuscles of human blood; 2, red to varv in mnmmila corpuscles of l,loocl of common fowl, seen on LO vary m mammals the surface and edgeways; 3, red corpuscles of from an average dia- Moofo/^wor- meter of ^Vg-th of an inch in the elephant, and ^th in Orycteropus capensis, t0 T-siiTs^1 in Tragulus javanicus, and he concludes that the smallest blood discs occur in the small species of an order or family, the largest in the large species. In birds they are larger than in mammals, and vary in length from an average of ^ inch in Casuarius javanicus to ^L^th in Linaria minor. In reptiles they are still larger, and vary in length from an average of : '*3 p;

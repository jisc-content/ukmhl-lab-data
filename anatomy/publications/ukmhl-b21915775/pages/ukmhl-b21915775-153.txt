137 EPITHELIUM. membrana tympani, the cells carrying the cilia are flattened and not cylindrical. Cilia occasion currents in the fluid in which they move, and play an important part in the economy of many animals; in some of the inveitebrata they serve as organs of locomotion, in others they propel currents over respiratory surfaces, and in others aid in bringing food within the animal’s reach. \ Transitional epithelium is the name applied to epithelial cells which have a form transitional between either the columnar and squamous epithelia, or the columnar and polygonal. The epithelium of the mucous lining of the bladder is transitional between the columnar and squamous varieties. In many glands the continuity of the epithelial layer from the polygonal cells of the gland-follicles to the columnar cells of the gland-ducts is kept up by interposed transitional cells, often cubical in shape. ! Glandular epithelium is situated on the free surface of the follicles or ultimate se- creting apparatus of glands, and the commencement of gland ducts. The cells are not Uniform in shape in the Fig. 33.—A, polygonal gland cells from the liver; B, spheroidal gland cells from different glands, so that the the saliva- name glandular applied to this epithelium expresses the locality and not the form of the cell. They are often poly- gonal, occasionally spheroidal (fig. 33), or columnar, or even ciliated. Their contents are specially differentiated into the secretion of the particular gland in which they are situated. The epithelial cells of a Secreting Gland rest upon a sub-epitlielial tissue, which frequently has the appearance of a membrane, the basement membrane of Bowman, or

335 THE EYEBALL. Fig. 98.â€”Stellate Cell from the centre of the Cornea of an Ox. (From Thin.') corpuscles were first seen by Toynbee, and have now been carefully studied. They are large stellate, flattened cells, and lie with their surfaces parallel to the surfaces of the cornea; they possess branching thread-like processes, and the processes of ad- jacent cells anasto- mose to form a cell network (fig. 98). Each corpuscle con- sists of a hyaline ground plate contain- ing an oval nucleus, which is surrounded by protoplasm. Both the protoplasm and the nucleus possess a close reticulum of fibrils (Klein). In vertical sections through the cornea the corpuscles seem as if shaped like elongated spindles. The migrating cells of the cornea were first seen by Yon Recklinghausen. They resemble white blood corpuscles, and possess active amoeboid movements, so that they can wander through the lacunae and lymph spaces of the cornea. In a healthy cornea they have migrated out of the marginal blood- vessels; but in an inflamed cornea, where their number is greatly increased, they are in part white corpuscles derived from the blood, and in part produced by proliferation of the proper cornea corpuscles. The intercellular matrix of the cornea consists of a laminated substance ; the lamellae are arranged parallel to the surfaces of the cornea, but contiguous lamellae anastomose with each other. The lamellae consist of extremely delicate filaments, collected into bundles. The adjacent lamellae are cemented together, and in the cement substance the branched lacunae of the cornea are situated. The lacunae anastomose with each

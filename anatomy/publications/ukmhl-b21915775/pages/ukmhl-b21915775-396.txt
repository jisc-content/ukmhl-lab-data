ANATOMY. 380 imbricated brusli-like processes. In the carnivora the epithelium is hardened so as to form sharp spines, with the points turned backwards, which give to the tongues of these animals a rough prickly character. In the fungi- form and circumvallate papillae the inequalities between the projecting secondary papillae are filled up by tessellated epithelium, so that the surface of the compound papillae has a smooth appearance. Both the simple and compound papillae are highly vascular, for the lingual artery supplies both the muscular substance of the tongue, and many branches to the mucous membrane, which end in simple Fig. 112. Section through a Gustatory lamella of the Rabbit's Tongue. 0, gusta- tory bulbs in relation to Ep, the epithelial layer of the mucous membrane; V, capillary blood-vessels in the sub-epithelial connective tissue. capillary loops in the' simple papilhe, but in the compound papillae the capillaries are so multiplied that each secondary papilla has a capillary loop within it. The tongue is provided with several nerves, viz., the hypo-glossal, glosso-pharyngeal, lingual branch of the 3d division of the 5th, and the chorda tympani of the portio dura of the 7th. The hypo-glossal nerve supplies its muscular structure, but the inferior lingualis and genio- hyo-glossus are said to receive branches from the chorda tympani of the facial. The glossal branch of the glosso-

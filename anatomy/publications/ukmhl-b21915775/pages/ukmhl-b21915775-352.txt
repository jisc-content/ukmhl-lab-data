Immediately under the anterior epithelium the bundles decussate with each other, and at the circumference of the cornea they run into the connective tissue of the sclerotic. Bowman described a translucent structureless layer or anterior elastic lamina between the conjunctival epithelium and the cornea proper, but it is doubtful if this layer exists as a constant arrange- ment. Bowman and other ob- servers have in- jected tubular- spaces in the cornea which are apparently situ- ated between the lamellae. The exact nature of these spaces is somewhat doubt- ful, but Thin be- Fig. 99.â€”Cornea treated by nitrate of silver to show ,. , , the lacuna; and a lymph-space, a, lymph-vessel; lieveS tliem to be b, line separating two of the cells forming its lining; c, communication between the vessel and a lacuna lympll-veSSelS tra- surrounding a cornea corpuscle; d, matrix of the . cornea; e, lacuna of the cornea.

It is probable that these spaces serve as channels for the mi- grating corpuscles to wander through. The 'posterior elastic lamina forms a distinct, tiauslucent,

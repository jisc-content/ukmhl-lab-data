ANATOMY. 724 The Liver. The Liver is the biggest of the abdominal viscera, and the largest gland in the body. It is the organ in which the secretion of bile takes place, and is the chief seat in the body of the formation of glycogen, a substance like dextrine, which readily undergoes conversion into sugar. It lies in the costal zone of the abdomen, fills up the greater part of the right hypochondrium, and extends, through the epigastrium, into the left hypochondrium. In its long or transverse diameter it averages about 12 inches, in its antero-posterior diameter about 6 inches, in the vertical diameter of its thickest part about 3 inches. Relatively to the size of the body the liver is bigger and heavier in the foetus than in the adult; soon after birth the relative weight declines, and that of the left lobe diminishes much more rapidly than the right lobe. Frerichs states that the relative weight of the healthy liver fluctuates in adults between ^th and ^jth that of the body, and the absolute weight varies from 1 '8 to 4'6 pounds avoird. During the digestion of the food the liver increases both in size and weight, partly from the greater quantity of blood flow- ing through it, and partly from the new material in the secreting cells; whilst after a long fast it becomes smaller and lighter. For descriptive purposes the liver may be regarded as having two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The superior or diaphragmatic surface, is smooth and con- vex, and in close contact with the under surface of the vault of the right half of the diaphragm, with its central

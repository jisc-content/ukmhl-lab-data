319 SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. and in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus, named the cavernous 'plexus. From the gangliated cord and its ascending or cranial prolongation a communicating and a distributory series of branches are derived. By the Communicating branches this portion of the sympathetic is connected with most of the cranial and with the anterior divisions of all the spinal nerves, so as to bring the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems into close anatomical and physiological relation with each other. It is important also to observe that each communicating branch contains both non-medullated nerve fibres from the sympathetic system to the cerebro-spinal nerves, and medullated fibres from the cerebro-spinal to the sympa- thetic, so that a double interchange takes place between the two systems. The superior cervical ganglion, with its cranial prolongation, communicates with the 3d and 4th cranial nerves, with the Gasserian, ciliary and spheno-pala- tine ganglia of the 5th, with the 6th, the portio dura of the 7th, the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric of the 8th, with the 9th cranial nerve, and with the anterior divisions of the four upper cervical spinal nerves. The middle cervical ganglion is in relation with the inferior thyroid artery, and communicates with the 5th and 6th cervical nerves; the inferior cervical ganglion is in relation with the vertebral artery and communicates with the 7th and 8th cervical nerves : the twelve thoracic ganglia communi- cate with the series of intercostal nerves; the five lumbar ganglia with the series of lumbar spinal nerves; the sacral and coccygeal ganglia with the sacral nerves and the coccygeal nerve. The Distributorij branches of the gangliated cord are as

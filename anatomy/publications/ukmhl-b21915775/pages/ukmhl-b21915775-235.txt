219 SPINAL COED. these membranes before they open into the blood sinuses of the cranial dura mater, and into the extra-dural venous plexus of the spinal canal. The vessels which pass from the pia mater into the brain and spinal cord are invested by a loose funnel-shaped sheath, which has been described as forming the wall of a peri-vascular lymphatic vessel, but Axel Key and Retzius consider that the space between the blood-vessel and the sheath opens into the sub-arachnoid space, and contains cerebro-spinal fluid. A network of lymph vessels ramifies freely in the pia mater. It is also well provided with nerves, which arise from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, from the 3d, 5th, 6th cranial nerves, glosso-pharyngeal and accessory of the 8th, and from the carotid and vertebral plexuses of the sympathetic. The epi-cerebral and epi-spinal spaces described by His as existing between the pia mater and the brain and spinal cord are in all probability artificial productions. Spinal Coed. The Medulla Spinalis, or Spinal Coed, occupies the spinal canal, and extends from the foramen magnum to opposite the body of the first lumbar vertebra. In the early foetus it equals in length the canal itself â€¢ but as the spinal column grows at a greater proportional rate than the cord, the latter, when growth has ceased, is several inches shorter than the column. The cord is continuous above with the medulla oblongata, whilst it tapers off below into the conus medullaris, which ends in a slender thread, the filum terminale. The filum lies in the axis of the sacral canal, and is attached, either to the fibrous membrane which closes in the sacral canal below, or to the back of the coccyx. The length of the cord is from 15 to 18 inches.

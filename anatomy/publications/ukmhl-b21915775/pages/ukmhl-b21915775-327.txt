ENCEPHALIC NERVES. 311 gray nucleus in the back of the pons, near the lateral angle of the 4th ventricle. The larger or sensory root has a com- plex originâ€”a, from a nucleus of grey matter in the pons to the outer side of the origin of the motor root: b, by descending fibres which arise from nerve cells in the sub- stance of the corpora quadrigemina,and from the grey matter of the locus cseruleus (Meynert) : c, by an ascending root which apparently arises from the grey tubercle of Rolando and ascends in the medulla external to the substantia gelatinosa, and between the restiform body and the corpus dentatum : d, probably by fibres from the cerebellum which accompany the superior peduncle of the cerebellum. The large sensory root of the fifth lies on the petrous bone, and expands into the Gasserian ganglion, which resembles in structure the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve. From this ganglion three large branches arise, named respectively the 1st, 2d, and 3d divisions of the ganglion (fig. 95). The 1st and 2d divisions are purely sensory, but the 3d division is joined by the motor root and becomes a mixed nerve. The ls< or Ophthalmic division is the upper sensory nerve of the face, it lies in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus and divides into three branches, which pass into the orbital cavity through the sphenoidal fissure. a, Its lachrymal branch supplies the lachrymal gland, and the outer part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid, and sends a branch to join the subcutaneous malar nerve. b, Its frontal branch divides into the supra-trochlear and supra-orbital; the supra-trochlear supplies the inner part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid and eye- brow ; the supra-orbital passes through the supra-orbital foramen and supplies the skin of the forehead and scalp as

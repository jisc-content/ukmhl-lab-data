284 ANATOMY. lucidum and anterior commissure, to the base of the cerebrum, where they form the white surface of the corpora albicantia, and send fibres into the anterior tubercle of the optic thalamus. The two halves diverge behind the body much further from each other, and form the flattened posterior pillars; each of which curves downwards and outwards into the descending cornu of the ventricle, where its fibres, partly spread out on the surface of the hippocampus major, and partly form the fimbria or tsenia hippocampi. The transverse fibres of the splenium of the corpus callosum form, between the diverging posterior pillars, the appearance called the jyra. If the body of the fornix be now divided by a transverse incision, its anterior part thrown forwards, and its posterior part backwards, the great transverse fissure of the cerebrum is opened into, and the velum interposition lying in that fissure is exposed (fig. 91). The Velum Interpositum is an expanded fold of pia mater, which passes into the cerebrum through the great transverse fissure. It is triangular in shape; its base is in a line with the splenium of the corpus callosum, where it is continuous with the pia mater investing the cerebral convo- lutions and the cerebellum: each lateral margin is fringed by the choroid plexus in the body and descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. Its apex, where the two choroid plexuses blend with each other, lies just behind the foramen of Monro and the anterior pillars of the fornix. The choroid plexuses contain the small choroidal arteries, which supply the corpora striata, optic thalami, and corpora quadrige- mina; and the blood from these bodies is returned by small veins, which join to form the veins of Galen (fig. 91). These veins pass along the centre of the velum, and, as is shown in fig, 72, open into the straight sinus. A. pair

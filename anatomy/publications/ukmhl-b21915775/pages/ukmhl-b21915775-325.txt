309 ENCEPHALIC NERVES. posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles; it then runs forwards through the parotid gland, where it expands into the pes anserinus, and divides into (e) temporo- facial and (/) cervico-facial branches to supply the facial muscles of expression, i.e., the muscles of the scalp and external ear, the orbicular muscle of the eyelids, the muscles which dilate and compress the nostrils, the bucci- nator, the muscles which approximate and separate the lips, and also the platysma myoides. The Chorda Tympani enters the tympanum and passes, between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the incus, to a small foramen near the Glaserian fissure, through which it goes, and joins the lingual branch of the 5th nerve, which it accompanies. It is complex both in distribution and function. It is said to supply motor branches to the inferior lingualis and genio-hyo-glossus; secretory branches, through the sub-maxillary ganglion, to the sub-maxillary and sub-lingual glands; sensory taste branches to the mucous membrane of the anterior part of the tongue (pp. 316, 384); vaso-motor fibres to the vessels of the anterior part of the tongue. The portio dura is also said, through the connection between its small petrosal nerve and the auriculo-temporal in the otic ganglion, to influence the secretion of the parotid gland. The Spinal Accessory is the lowest division of the 8th nerve. It springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata, and from the lateral column of the spinal cord as low as the 6th cervical nerve: its roots arise from the intermedio- lateral group of nerve cells in the cervical cord, and from the nucleus accessorius in the floor of the 4th ventricle close to the nucleus of the vagus. The spinal fibres of origin enter the skull through the foramen magnum, join

322 ANATOMY. The cardiac plexus also sends offsets to the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses for the supply of nerves to the lungs. The Prevertebral Solar or Epigastric plexus is situated at the pit of the stomach around the coeliac axis, a branch of the abdominal aorta. It receives the â€˜great and small splanchnic nerves from the thoracic ganglia of the sympa- thetic, and some of the terminal branches of the pneumo- gastric nerve. It contains large collections of nerve cells, which form the two semilunar ganglia, and a dense plexi- form arrangement of nerve fibres. It gives origin, either directly or indirectly, to numerous plexiform branches, which accompany, and are named after, the abdominal aorta and its various branches given off to the walls and viscera of the abdomen proper. In this manner, not only do the arteries which supply the abdominal viscera receive their vaso-motor nerves, but also the muscular and mucous coats of the stomach, intestines, gall bladder, bile ducts, ureters, and seminal ducts, the glandular structures of the liver, pancreas, kidneys, testes, and the spleen and supra- renal capsules. It is important also to observe that these plexuses of distribution not unfrequently contain small ganglia, and the branches which supply the muscular coat of the stomach and intestines have minute microscopic ganglia, with stellate nerve cells lying amidst them. The distribution of the pneumogastric nerve to the stomach, and its connection with the solar plexus, enables that nerve to stimulate its peristaltic contraction, and, according to some experimenters, that of the small intestine also; but the precise action of the sympathetic on these organs is still a disputed question, though some physiologists hold that it is the inhibitory nerve for those organs.

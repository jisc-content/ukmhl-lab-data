98 ANATOMY. Metacarpo-phalangeal and Inter phalangeal Joints.— Lateral ligaments pass between tbe bones; on tbe dorsal aspect is a ligament containing a fibro-cartilage, distinct from the extensor tendon, and on the palmar aspect is a fibro-cartilaginous band. The muscles which move the thumb act on its carpo- metacarpal, metacarpo-pha- langeal, and inter-phalangeal joints, and are inserted either into the metacarpal bone or phalanges. They either pass from the fore-arm to the thumb, or are grouped to- gether at the outer part of the palm, and form the ele- vation known as the ball of the thumb. The thumb is extended and abducted, i.e., drawn away from the index, by the extensor ossis meta- carpi inserted into the ba§e of the metacarpal, the extensor primi internodii into the base of the 1st phalanx, the extensor secundi internodii into the Fig. 23.—Deep Muscles of the Palm of , » , ■, . the Hand. i, abductor poiiicis cut base of the .jd phalanx, and, short: 2, opponens; 3 and 4, sub- 7 , ..... divisions of flexor brevis; 5, ad by the aocluctor pollzCZSj in- ductor; 6, 6', tendon of long flexor . of thumb; 7, abductor of the little serted into the radial side of finger; 8, short flexor ; 9, opponens; 10, tendon of flexor carpi uinaris; the base ot the 1st phalanx: its 11, tendon of long supinator; tt> transverse metacarpal ligament. bones are bent on each other by the flexor longus poiiicis inserted into the base of the 2d and the flexor brevis into the base of the 1st phalanx it

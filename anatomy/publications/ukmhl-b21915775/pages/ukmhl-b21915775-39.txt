AXIAL SKELETON—HEAD. 23 denticulated, and it is by the interlocking of the denticula- tions of adjacent bones that they are jointed together, the joints being named suttires. The bones are pierced by holes or foramina, and similar holes exist between the adjacent margins of some of the bones. These foramina are mostly situated in the floor of the skull; they transmit arteries into the cranial cavity to supply the brain and the inner table with blood, and veins and nerves out of the cavity. The largest of these holes is called foramen magnum. It lies in the occipital bone, immediately above the ring of the atlas; through it the spinal marrow becomes continuous with the brain, and the vertebral arteries enter to supply the brain with blood. The Occipital, or bone of the Back of the Head (figs. 6 and 7), consists of four originally distinct pieces fused into a curved plate-like bone. Its divisions are arranged around the foramen magnum—the basilar part, bad-occipital, in front; the condyloid parts, ex-occipitcils, one on each side ; and the tabular part, or supra-occipital, behind. The anterior surface of the supra-occipital is divided into four fossm, in the two upper are lodged the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, in the two lower the cerebellum; the upper and lower pairs of fossae are separated by a transverse groove for the lodgment of the lateral venous sinus. The posterior surface is marked by a protuberance, by two trans- verse curved lines and by a vertical crest; by its margin the supra-occipital articulates with the parietal and mastoid temporal bones. Each ex-occipital has on its under surface a smooth condyle for articulation with the atlas; in front of the condyle is a foramen which transmits the 9th cranial or hypoglossal nerve, and behind it a foramen sometimes exists for the transmission of a vein: external to each

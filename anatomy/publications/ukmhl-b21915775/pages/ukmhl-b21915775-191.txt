MUSCULAR TISSUE. 175 Muscular Tissue. The muscular tissue is that which is actively concerned either in the movement of parts of the body on each other, or in the movement of the entire body from place to place ; it is, from its contractile properties, the active agent, there- fore, both in motion and locomotion. It forms a large pro- portion of the general mass of the body, is the essential constituent of the muscles or flesh, and enters into the formation of the walls of the hollow viscera. It consists structurally of threads or fibres, some of which are distin- guished by being marked with transverse stripes or striae ; others have no such markings. Hence it is customary to divide the fibres of the muscular tissue into transversely striped fibres and non-striped fibres. As a rule, the striped fibres are collected together to form those muscles which are under the influence of the Will, so that both the muscles and the fibres of which they are composed are called voluntary. An important exception to this rule is, how- ever, met with in the heart, the muscular fibres of which, though transversely striped, are involuntary; the Will exercises no control over the action of the heart. The muscles of the pharynx and upper part of the oesophagus are also striped, but their action is involuntary. The non-striped fibres, and the muscles into the construction of which they enter, are not subject to the influence of the will; so that they are involuntary. The Non-striped or Involuntary fibre, sometimes called pale or smooth muscular fibre, enters into the formation of the walls of the hollow viscera—e.g., stomach, intestines, bladder, uterus—of the walls of the air-tubes, gland-ducts, blood and lymph vessels, of the skin, and various mucous membranes. The fibres are usually collected into bundles

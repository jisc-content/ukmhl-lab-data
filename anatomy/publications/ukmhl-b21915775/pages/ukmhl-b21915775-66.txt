ANATOMY. so and not a line ; it gives attachment to several muscles. The lower end of the bone presents a large smooth articular surface for the knee-joint, the anterior portion of which forms a trochlea or pulley for the movements of the patella, whilst the lower and posterior part is divided into two convex condyles by a deep intercondyloid fossa which gives attachment to the crucial' ligaments of the knee. The inner and outer surfaces of the condyles are called tuberosi- ties, and are rough for the attachment of muscles and the lateral ligaments of the knee, and the outer tuberosity is grooved externally for the tendon of the popliteus. The Patella or Knee-pan (fig. 11) is a small triangular flattened bone developed in the tendon of the extensor muscles of the leg. Its anterior surface and sides are rough, for the attachment of that tendon; its posterior surface is smooth, and enters into the formation of the knee-joint. Between tlie two bones of the leg there are no movements of prona- tion and supination as between the two bones of the fore-arm. The tibia and fibula are fixed in position ; the fibula is always^external, the tibia internal. The Tibia or Shin-bone (fig. 11) is the larger and more important of the two bones of the leg j the femur moves and rests upon its upper end, and down it the weight of the body in the erect position is transmitted to the foot. Except the femur, it is the longest bone of the skeleton, and consists of a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity is broad, and is expanded into two tuberosities the external of which has a small articular facet interiorly for the head of the fibula, and the internal is grooved for the tendon of the semi-membranosus; superiorly, the tuberosities have two smooth surfaces, for articulation with the condyles of the femur; they are separated by an

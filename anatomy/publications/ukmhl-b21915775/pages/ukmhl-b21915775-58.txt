ANATOMY. 42 attachment of muscles, and a sharp outer border for the interosseous membrane. The lower end, much smaller than the upper, has a pointed styloid process and a smooth articular surface, the outer portion of which is for the lower end of the radius, the lower portion for moving on the tri- angular fibro-cartilage of the wrist joint. This end is grooved behind for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris. The Hand consists of the Carpus or wrist, of the Meta- carpus or palm, and of five free Digits, the thumb and four fingers. Anatomists describe it with the palm turned to the front, and with its axis in line with the axis of the fore-arm. The Carpal or Wrist bones (fig. 9), eight in number and small in- size, are arranged in two rows, a proximal—i.e. a row next the fore-arm,—consisting of the Scaphoid, Semilunar, Cuneiform, and Pisiform; and a distal—i.e., a row next the bones of the palm,—consisting of the Trapezium, Trapezoid, Os Magnum, and Unciform; the bones in each row being named in their order from the radial or outer to the ulnar or inner side of the wrist. Except the pisiform bone, shaped like a split pea, which articulates with the front of the cuneiform, each carpal bone is short and irregularly cuboidal in shape ; its anterior (or palmar) surface and its posterior (or dorsal) are rough, for the attachment of ligaments; its superior and inferior surfaces are invariably smooth, for articulation with adjacent bones; the inner and outer surfaces are also smooth for articulation, except the outer surface of the scaphoid and trapezium (the two external bones of the carpus), and the inner surface of the cuneiform and unciform (the two internal bones). The pisiform articulates with only one bone; the cuneiform with three and with the triangular fibro-cartilage; the trapezoid and trapezium each with

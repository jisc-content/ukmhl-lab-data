Before dividing it supplies articular branches to the hip-joint and muscular branches to the three hamstring muscles, and to the adductor magnus. The external popliteal nerve gives two articular branches to the knee-joint, passes down the outer side of the leg, gives off the communicans fibularis branch to the skin of the outer side of the back of the leg, and divides into the recurrent articular, musculo-cutaneous, and anterior tibial nerves. The recurrent articular ascends to the knee- joint. The musculo-cutaneous nerve supplies muscular branches to the peronei longus and brevis, and cutaneous branches to the skin of the leg, the dorsum of the foot and the dorsal surfaces of all the toes, except the outer side of the little and the contiguous sides of the great and 2d toes. The anterior tibial passes to the front of the leg, supplies muscular branches to the tibialis anticus, peroneus tertius, long and short extensor muscles of the toes, tarsal joints, and terminates as the cutaneous digital nerve for the contiguous sides of the great and 2d toes. The internal popliteal nerve gives three articular branches to the knee- joint, and supplies the communicans tibialis nerve, which joins the communicans fibularis, and forms with it the ex-

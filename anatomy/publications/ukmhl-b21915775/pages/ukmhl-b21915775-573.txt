THE SPLEEN. 557 The great increase which not unfrequently takes place in the bulk of the spleen, leads to an extension of its relations to surrounding parts; and in these cases it may be.seen appearing at the side of the great curvature of the stomach, or even projecting, obliquely downwards and for- wards, into the lumbar or umbilical regions of the abdo- men. Occasionally also portions of spleen substance are detached, and form accessory spleens, situated in the great omentum, or in the gastro-splenic omentum. More rarely the spleen is divided into a number of perfectly distinct lobes • a condition which is normally found in some animals, as the pilot whale. Structure.—The spleen is a solid organ of a bluish-purple colour, and so soft in its texture that it is easily ruptured and torn. It possesses two coats,—a serous and a fibrous. The serous or external coat is a part of the peritoneal membrane. It invests the spleen, and is reflected from it to the diaphragm as the suspensory ligament, and to the stomach as the gastro-splenic omentum. The fibrous coat, or tunica propria, is immediately sub- jacent and intimately united to the serous coat. It is composed of white fibrous tissue with elastic fibres ; in many animals, as the ox and dog, it contains a large pro- portion of non-striped muscular tissue, but in man the mus- cularity is only feeble. At the hilus it passes into the in- terior of the spleen along with the vessels and uerves, for which it forms sheaths. From the whole extent of the inner surface of the tunica propria processes pass into the substance of the spleen, which interlace freely with each other so as to form a network, the trabecular framework of the spleen.

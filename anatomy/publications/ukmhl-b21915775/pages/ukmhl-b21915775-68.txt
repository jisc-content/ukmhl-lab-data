ANATOMY. 52 five free Digits or Toes, which is the maximum number found in mammals. The human foot is placed in the prone position, with the sole or plantar surface in relation to the ground ; the dorsum or back of the foot directed upwards; the axis of the foot at about a right angle to the axis of the leg; and the great toe or hallux, which is the corresponding digit to the thumb, at the inner border of the foot. The human foot, therefore, is a pentadactylous, plantigrade foot. The bones of the Tarsus, or Ankle (fig. 11, Tr), are seven in number, and are arranged in two transverse rows,—a proximal, next the bones of the leg, consisting of the Astragalus, Os Calcis, and Scaphoid; a distal, next the metatarsus, consisting of the Cuboid, Ecto-, Meso-, and Ento-cuneiform. If the tarsal bones be looked at along with those of the metatarsus and toes, the bones of the foot may be arranged in two longitudinal columns,—an outer, consisting of the os calcis, cuboid, and the metatarsal bones and phalanges of the 4th and 5th toes ; an inner column consisting of the astragalus, scaphoid, three cuneiform, and the metatarsal bones and phalanges of the 1st, 2d, and 3d toe^. The tarsal, like the carpal bones, are short and irregularly cuboidal; the dorsal and plantar surfaces are as a rule rough for ligaments, but as the astragalus is locked in between the bones of the leg and the os calcis, its dorsal and plantar surfaces, as well as the dorsum of the os calci3, are smooth for articulation; similarly, its lateral surfaces are smooth for articulation with the two malleoli. Except the posterior surface of the os calcis which projects back- wards to form the prominence of the heel, and the posterior surface of the astragalus which is grooved for the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, the tarsal bones have their anterior and posterior surfaces smooth for articulation.

ANATOMY. 674 opposite sides, and is sometimes called the pit of the stomach; whilst the hypochondriac regions are under cover of the lower ribs and costal cartilages. The lumbar zone is subdivided into two lateral regions, the rigid and the left lumbar regions, or the loins, and a middle or umbilical region ; in the middle of the umbilical region is the navel, which is placed opposite the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The iliac zone is subdivided into two lateral regions, the right and the left iliac regions, and a middle or hypogastrium; the hypogastrium is situated immedi- ately above the pubic symphysis and the bodies of the two pubic bones, and opposite the bodies of the sacral vertebras. The position of the viscera in these regions will be given in the account of their descriptive anatomy. The Peritoneum is the largest and most complicated serous membrane in the body. Like the other serous membranes, it not only lines the walls of the cavity in which it is situated, but gives a more or less complete in- vestment to the contained viscera. It is arranged, there- fore, so as to form a parietal and a visceral part, which are continuous with each other in the various regions, where the part lining the wall is reflected as a covering upon the viscera. A. space or cavity, called the peritoneal cavity, is enclosed between the parietal and visceral layers. This cavity, as in other serous membranes, is a closed or shut sac, without any communication externally, except in the female, where the two Fallopian tubes open into it. Through these openings the mucous membrane lining the tubes becomes continuous with the serous membrane, and a communication is established between the lumen of each tube and the peritoneal cavity. That surface of both the

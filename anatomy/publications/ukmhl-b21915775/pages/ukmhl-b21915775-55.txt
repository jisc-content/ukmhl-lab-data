APrENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 39 scapula in correlation with the great size of the trapezius and deltoid muscles, which are concerned in the elevation and abduction of the upper limb. The borders of the scapula, posterior, superior, anterior, give attachment to several muscles. The angles are inferior, supero-posterior, and supero-anterior. The supero-anterior is the most important; it is truncated, and presents a large, shallow, oval, smooth surface,, the glenoid fossa, for articulation with the humerus, to form the shoulder joint. Overhanging the glenoid fossa is a curved beak-like process, the coracoid, which is of importance as corresponding with the separate coracoid bone of birds and reptiles : it gives attachment to muscles and ligaments. The line of demarcation between the coracoid and the scapula proper is marked on the upper border of the scapula by the suprascapular notch. The Humerus, or bone of the Upper Arm (fig. 9), is a long bone, and consists of a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity of this bone possesses a convex spheroidal smooth surface, the head, for articulation with the glenoid fossa of the scapula ; it is surrounded by a narrow constricted anatomical neclc, and where the neck and shaft become continuous with each other, two tubero- sities are found, to which are attached the rotator muscles arising from the scapular fossae. Between the tuberosities is the bicipitcd groove in which the long tendon of the biceps rests ; this groove is bounded in front and behind by the bicipital ridges. A line drawn through the head of the humerus perpendicular to the middle of its articular surface, forms with the axis of the shaft of the bone an angle of 40°. The shaft of the humerus is cylindriform above, but three-sided and expanded below ; about midway down the outer surface is a rough ridge for the insertion

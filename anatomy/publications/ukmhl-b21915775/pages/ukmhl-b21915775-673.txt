SALIVA11Y GLANDS. 657 section present a semilunar form; they were first described by Gianuzzi as the semilunar body. Lavdowsky states that the semilunar cells are connected together by a network of exceedingly delicate threads of protoplasm. Though some have supposed these two forms of cells to be quite distinct, it is not improbable that the peripheral, so-called semilunar cells are merely a younger stage of the central secreting cells, which have not yet undergone a mucous change. Both kinds of cells are found in the submaxillary and sub- lingual glands j but in the parotid, the secreting cells ex- hibit a uniform granulated protoplasm, and do not undergo the mucous change. Heidenhain has pointed out that, when the submaxillary gland has been stimulated for some time, the central cells lose their clear transparent appearance, and assume the characters of a granulated protoplasm, a change which is doubtless due to the contained “mucus” being poured out in the secretion. Boll has described the membrana propria of the gland-vesicles as consisting of anastomosing connective tissue cells, and an anastomosing reticulum of connective tissue corpuscles has been said to exist between the cells situated within the vesicles. Pfliiger has desci’ibed minute channels, or intercellular passages between the secreting cells, which communicate with the lumen of the duct, and serve as the passages along which the salivary secretion flows out of the vesicle. Schliiter and Pfliiger have described smooth muscular fibre-cells, arranged either solitarily, or in fasciculi, in the connective tissue framework of the salivary glands. The blood-vessels are distributed in the interlobular con- nective tissue, and form a capillary network on the wall of the gland-ducts, and on the wall of the gland vesicles.

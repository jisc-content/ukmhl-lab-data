AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. 31 narrow border with the other superior maxilla and with the vomer, and, posteriorly, with the palate bone. The Palate-bone (fig. 7) articulates with the inner sur- face and posterior palatal border of the superior maxilla, and separates it from the sphenoid. It is in shape not unlike the capital letter L; the horizontal 'plate forms by its lower surface the back of the bony roof of the mouth, and by its upper the back of the floor of the nose : it arti- culates mesially with its fellow and with the vomer. The ascending plate assists in forming the outer wall of the nose, has a horizontal ridge on its inner surface for the inferior turbinal, and is divided superiorly by the splieno-palatine notch into an anterior, or orbital, and a posterior, or sphenoidal process, by which it articulates with the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid. At the junction of the two plates is the pyramidal prrocess, which articulates with the lower ends of the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid : near the root of this process are the posterior palatine foramina. The Yomer (fig. 7), shaped like a ploughshare, lies verti- cally in the mesial plane of the nose, and forms a large part of the partition which separates one nostril from the other. It articulates above with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid and the mes-ethmoid : below with the palatal processes of the superior maxillae and palate-bones; in front with the septal cartilage of the nose, whilst the posterior border is free, and forms the hinder edge of the nasal septum. The Inferior Turbinated is a slightly convoluted bone situated below the middle turbinal of the ethmoid, on the outer wall of the nose, where it articulates with the superior maxilla, palate ethmoid, and lachrymal bones. The Lachrymal (fig. 6) is a small scale-like bone, in shape not unlike a finger-nail, placed at the inner wall of

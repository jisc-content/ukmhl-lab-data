ANATOMY. 92 from the hyoid to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx; pre- liminary to their action, the lower jaw must be fixed, which is done by the closure of the mouth prior to the act of swallowing. The aperture of the larynx is thus brought into contact with the depressed epiglottis, which is adapted more exactly to the opening by a change in its form due to the projection of a cushion-like pad from its posterior surface. By these arrangements the nose and larynx are temporarily shut off from the buccal part of the pharynx, and the adapta- tion of a single chamber to the very different functions of breathing and swallowing is effectively provided for. Joints and Muscles of the Upper Limb. The upper limb is jointed to the trunk at the diar- throdial Sterno-clavicular Joint. The bones are connected by anterior and posterior ligaments, and a meniscus is inter- posed between the articular surfaces, so that the joint possesses two synovial membranes. A strong costo-clavicular ligament, which checks too great upward movement, con- nects the clavicle and 1st costal cartilage, and the inner ends of the clavicles are connected by the inter-clavicular ligament. The two bones of the shoulder girdle articulate with each other at the diarthrodial Acromio-clavicular Joint, which possesses a capsular ligament and a meniscus; but, in addition, a strong coraco-clavicular ligament, which checks too great displacement of the bones, passes between the clavicle and coracoid. The movements of the upper limb on the trunk take place at the sterno-clavicular joint, and consist in the elevation, depression, forward and back- ward movement of the shoulder. The movements at the acromio-clavicular joint occur when the scapula is rotated on the clavicle in the act of elevating the arm above the

40 ANATOMY. of the deltoid muscle, and on the inner surface another rough mark for the insertion of the coraco-brachialis. The demarcation between the cylindriform and three-sided parts of the shaft is marked by the shallow musculv-spiral groove winding round the back of the bone, in which the musculo-spiral nerve is lodged. The lower extremity of the humerus consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular presents a small head or capitellum for the radius, and a pulley or trochlea for the movements of the ulna in flexion and extension of the limb. The non-articular part consists of two condyloid eminences, internal and external. The external, or epicondyle, has a ridge passing up the outer border of the bone; the ridge and eminence give origin to the supinator and extensor muscles in the fore-arm. From the internal eminence, or epi-troclilea, a ridge passes up the inner border of the shaft of the bone; this eminence gives origin to the pronator and flexor muscles in the fore-arm. In nearly two per cent, of the bodies examined in the anatomy-rooms in the University of Edinburgh, a hooked process has been seen projecting from the shaft of the bone, about 2 inches above the epi-trochlea ; this process is connected to the epi-trochlea by a fibrous band, so as to form a foramen, which has been called supra-condyloid. In these cases the median nerve invariably passes through the foramen, and is usually accompanied by the brachial artery. In the feline carnivora and some other mammals a foramen con- stantly occurs in this part of the humerus, through which, as a rule, both nerve and artery proceed, though in the common and ringed seals it transmits only the nerve. The two hones of the fore-arm can change their relative position to each, other. In one position, which is called Supine, they lie parallel,

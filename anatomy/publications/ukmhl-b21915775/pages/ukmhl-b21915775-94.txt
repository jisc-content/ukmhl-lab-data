ANATOMY. 78 along with the iliacus in the small trochanter of the femur. The sterno-cleido-mastoid, which arises from the sternum and clavicle, aids in the movements of the head through being inserted into the mastoid-temporal and supei-ior curved line of the occiput. The Spine and Trunk can be moved in the antero-posterior plane, in the transverse plane and obliquely. The antero- posterior movements are ventral flexion, extension, and dorsi-flexion, and to produce them the corresponding muscles on the two sides must act together. Ventral flexion or bending forwards is due to the action of the psoas, the longitudinal fibres of each longus colli, and to the recti abdominis, which draw on the spine owing to then- insertion into the 5th, 6 th, and 7th ribs. Extension, as in bringing the body to the erect attitude, and dorsi-flexion are due to the interspiuales and the erectores spinse with their subdivisions. Movements in the transverse plane, i.e., flexion either to the right or left, are produced by the intertransversales, erector spinae, scaleni, serrati postici, and oblique muscles of the abdomen of that side. The oblique movements consist of a rotation or a screwing of the spine either to the right or to the left. To screw the spine so that the trunk may be turned to the right, the left great oblique rotator muscle contracts, the right splenius colli, and the upper oblique fibres of the left longus colli taking their fixed point at the atlas. The opposite muscles contract when the trunk is turned to the left. The Head is balanced on the summit of the spine, and can be moved in the antero-posterior and transverse planes, and by rotation. The antero-posterior or nodding move- ments take place at the occipito-atloid joints, and are produced by the corresponding muscles on the two sides

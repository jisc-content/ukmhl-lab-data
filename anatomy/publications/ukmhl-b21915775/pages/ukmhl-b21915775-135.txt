GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 119 Bat a most important advance in our conceptions of the essential structure of a cell was made when Briicke pointed out that the contents of cells not unfrequently possessed the property of spontaneous movement and contractility, and when Max Schultze determined that the contractile substance termed sarcode, which forms so large a part of the bodies of the lower animals, was analogous and apparently homologous with the contents of young actively- growing animal and vegetable cells, before a differentiation of these contents into special secretions or other materials had taken place. As the term “protoplasm” had been introduced by Yon Mohl to express the contents of the vegetable cell, which undergo changes in the process of growth, it was adopted by the animal histologist; and Max Schultze suggested that a cell should be defined to be a nucleated mass of protoplasm,—a definition which is adopted in this book. Now, as protoplasm, whether it occurs along with a uucleus in the form of a cell, or in independent clumps or cytodes, exhibits not merely the property of contractility, but the power of growing and maintaining itself, it is regarded as the functionally active constituent of the cell. And thus our conceptions as to the part of the cell in which the functional activity resides have passed through three phases. In the first, the cell wall; in the second, the nucleus; in the third, the protoplasm cell contents, or cell substance, has been looked upon as the active constituent, not only as regards its nutrition, but the reproduction of young cells. But though the proto- plasm can of itself perform these offices, yet there can be no doubt, as Barry and Goodsir were the first to show, that the nucleus of the cell plays a part in the multiplica- tion of cells by self-division.

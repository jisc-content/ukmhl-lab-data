ANATOMY. 250 restiforme, and that these cells in their turn give origin to the fibres which reach the cerebellum. Meynert, however, holds that a number of the fibres of the restiform body pass off as the arciform fibres, and cross through the raphe to the opposite side of the medulla. The anterior pyramid is formed in large part of the crossed pyramidal tract of the lateral column of the opposite side of the cord (fig. 78). These decussating tracts, from the opposite sides, form at the bottom of the anterior median fissure the well-known motor decussating fibres, and represent, but in an ex- aggerated form, the fibres of the anterior commissure of the cord, which cross from the lateral column of one side to the opposite anterior column. They form the part of the anterior pyramid, which lies next the anterior median fissure; whilst the outer part of the pyramid contains the direct pyramidal tract of the anterior column. But this pyramid also receives fibres from the posterior cornu and posterior column of the opposite side of the cord (Clarke) which constitute the sensitive pyramidal decussation of Meynert, and it contains arciform fibres. The fibres of the anterior pyramid ascend through the pons and crus cerebri to the cerebrum. The external fibres or basis bundle of the anterior column, with fibres of the mixed zone of the lateral column, form the olivary fillet or lemniscus which ascends to the pons. The medulla oblongata, in addition to the tracts which form its surface, contains nerve fibres within its substance. Above the decussation of the pyramids a well-marked raphe extends mesially from the bottom of the anterior median fissure to the floor of the 4th ventricle. It consists chiefly of commissural fibres crossing between the two sides of the medulla, which are in great part continuous with the in-

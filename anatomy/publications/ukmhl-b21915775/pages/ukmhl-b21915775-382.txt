ANATOMY. 366 locking of cog-like processes connected with the articular surfaces of the two bones, the range of movement is so limited that the pressure on the malleus is transmitted through the incus upon the stapes, which presses, therefore, on the membrane of the fenestra ovalis; so that the move- ments of the membrana tympani are thus transmitted to fluid within the labyrinth. The tensor tympani muscle tightens the tympanic membrane by drawing the handle of the malleus inwards, and still further adapts the structures for the transmission of sound-vibrations. The laxator tympani is considered to be the antagonistic muscle to the tensor tympani. The stapedius draws the head of the stapes backwards, so that the posterior border of the base will press against the fenestra ovalis, and the anterior border will be raised from it. Internal Ear. The Internal Ear, named the Labyrinth, from its com- plex construction, is the part of the auditory apparatus in which the nerve of hearing is distributed, and where the peripheral end-organs are situated. It is enclosed within the petrous bone, and is divided into three parts, viz,, vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea, each of which consists of an osseous and a membranous portion. The Vestibule lies immediately internal to the tympanum, between it and the bottom of the internal auditory meatus ; behind the vestibule are the semicircular canals, and in front is situated the cochlea. It is the part of the labyrinth which first appears in animals, and is therefore the most constant part of the organ. In the myxinoid fishes a single semicircular canal is superadded to the vestibule, in the lamprey two canals, but in other fishes and in the higher vertebrates three canals exist.

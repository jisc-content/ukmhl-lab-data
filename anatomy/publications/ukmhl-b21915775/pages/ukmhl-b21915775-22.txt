ANATOMY. 6 the head is cephalic or atlantal, that directed towards the coccyx is caudal or sacral, that towards the back is dorsal, that towards the front is ventral or haemal. The term pre-axicd has been employed by some anatomists as equivalent to atlantal, and post-axial to sacral. The body may be considered as divided by an imaginary plane, the mesial plane, into two lateral and similar halves, a right and a left, so that it exhibits a bilateral symmetry , the line in front where the plane reaches the surface of the body is the anterior mesial line, the line behind, where it reaches the surface, is the posterior mesicd line. The con- stituent parts of the body are described as being external or internal to each other, according to their relative position to this plane, or these lines. Parts which are near the surface are superficial in relation to those lying further from the surface, which are deep. For descriptive purposes, also, we may divide the body into Axial and Appendicular portions. The Axial part is the stock or stem of the body, and consists of the Head, the Neck, and the Trunk. The trunk is subdivided into the chest or Thorax, and the belly or Abdomen; and the abdomen is again subdivided into the Abdomen Proper and the Pelvis. The axial part contains the organs essential to the preservation of life. In the head is lodged the brain, from which the spinal marrow is prolonged down the spinal canal. At the sides of the head are the ears, and opening on to the face are the eyes, nostrils, and mouth. Prolonged down the neck are the gullet and windpipe, with the latter of which is associated the organ of voice. Within the chest lie the heart, lungs, and gullet; and in the abdomen are contained the stomach, intestine, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and other organs concerned in the urinary

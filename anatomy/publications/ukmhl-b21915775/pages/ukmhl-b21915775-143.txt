127 THE BLOOD. undergone a special chemical differentiation into haemoglo- bin, a proximate principle characterised by containing iron as one of its essential constituents. The action of water, spirit, acids, alkalies, various gases, heat, cold, and electrical currents, on the red corpuscles has been studied by several observers, and the conclusion has been reached that the corpuscles consist of a “ stroma,” in the interstices of which the coloured part of the corpuscle is placed. The stroma though denser at the periphery than in the centre does not form a definite investing envelope or membrane. When blood is drawn from the vessels the red corpuscles, in about half a minute, run together into piles, like rouleaux of coins (fig. 29), which arrange themselves into irregular meshes. Fig. 29.—1, red corpuscles of healthy human blood; 2, red corpuscles beginning to form rouleaux; 3, mesh-like arrangement in healthy blood; 4, mesli-like arrangement in huffy blood, where the meshes are larger than in healthy blood. In inflammatory diseases, and in the blood of pregnant women, the piles of corpuscles form more readily, and at the same time sink rapidly below the surface of the fluid, so as to cause the “ buffy coat ” seen in the blood coagulum. In the healthy blood of horses a buffy coat is formed as a natural condition of the coagulation.

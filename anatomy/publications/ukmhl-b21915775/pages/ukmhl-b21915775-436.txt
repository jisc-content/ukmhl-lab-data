420 ANATOMY. the pulmonary artery at its bifurcation, and has connected to it the obliterated ductus arteriosus. Its upper surface gives origin to the three arteries for the head, neck, and upper limbs, and is in relation to the left brachio-cephalic vein. The descending part of the arch is covered by the left pleura and overlapped by the left lung, whilst the oeso- phagus and thoracic duct are to its right side. The root of the left lung lies in the concavity of the arch of the aorta. The Descending Thoracic Aorta is continuous with the descending part of the arch. It extends from the lower border of the left side of the body of the fifth dorsal ver- tebra, as far as the front of the body of the last dorsal vertebra, where it passes through the opening between the pillars of the diaphragm and becomes the abdominal aorta. It is in contact with and follows the curvature of the thoracic spine, and inclines from its left side to its anterior surface. It lies in the posterior mediastinal division of the interpleural space, and is partially covered by the left pleura. The left lung and pericardium are anterior to it. The oesophagus is at first to its right side, but crosses in front, so as to lie, immediately above the diaphragm, to its left side. The thoracic duct and greater azygos vein are to its right side, but the smaller azygos vein passes behind it. The Abdominal Aorta is directly continuous with the descending thoracic aorta. It extends from the front of the last dorsal vertebra as far as the body of the fourth lumbar, where it bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries, a little to the left of the mesial plane. It lies on the bodies of the upper four lumbar vertebral and discs, and

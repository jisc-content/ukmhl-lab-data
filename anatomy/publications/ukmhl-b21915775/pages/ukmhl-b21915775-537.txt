521 FEMORAL VEIN. the dorsum of tlie foot and in the sole. Those which arise on the dorsum of the foot form the anterior tibial veins, and accompany the anterior tibial artery) they receive a considerable number of branches in their upward course, which proceed from the mass of muscles lying on the front of the leg. The veins which begin in the sole of the foot accompany the plantar arteries, form the plantar veins, and then pass upwards, along the inner ankle, to reach the back of the leg, along which they ascend as the posterior tibial veins, closely accompanying the posterior tibial artery, and receiving in their course numer- ous small veins that proceed from the muscles of the back of the leg, and the peroneal veins. At the upper part of the leg the anterior tibial veins pass to the back of the leg, and join the posterior tibial veins. The large popliteal vein, formed by their junction, ascends behind the knee- joint, lying in the ham, along with the popliteal artery. At the upper part of the popliteal space it passes to the inner side of the thigh, ascends as the femoral vein, alongside of the femoral artery, as far as Poupartâ€™s ligament, when it enters the cavity of the abdomen and becomes the external iliac vein. At the upper part of the thigh the femoral receives the profunda vein, corresponding to the profunda artery of the thigh, which conveys the blood that has been carried by that artery to the numerous large and important muscles of the thigh. The femoral vein is also joined near this spot by the superficial long saphenous vein, into which the superficial epigastric, pudic and circumflex iliac veins open immediately before its termination. Valves exist in the femoral and the otlier veins in the lower limbs.

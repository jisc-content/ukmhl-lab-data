MEMBRANES OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 217 with the interior of the Pacchionian bodies ; with the ventricles of the brain through the foramina of Magendie and Key and Retzius in the region of the 4th ventricle; with the serous and lymphatic spaces of the organs of sense, and along the nerve roots with a serous system of spaces situated around the entire peripheral nervous system up to its peri- pheral ramifications (Key and Retzius). The sub-arachnoid space contains a limpid cerebro-spinal fluid, which varies in quantity from 2 drachms to 2 ounces. The fluid is alkaline, of sp. gr. 1â€˜005, contains a little albumen, and a substance which, as I pointed out many years ago, reduces blue oxide of copper to the state of yellow sub-oxide. Some anatomists regard the arachnoid membrane as the visceral layer of a serous membrane, and the endothelial lining of the dura mater as the parietal layer of the same membrane, whilst the sub-dural space is the intermediate serous cavity. When the skull cap is removed, clusters of granular bodies, often of a reddish colour, are usually to be seen imbedded in the dura mater on each side of the superior longitudinal sinus; these are named the Pacchionian bodies or arachnoidal villi. When traced through the dura mater they are found to spring from the visceral or proper cerebral arachnoid. Each Pacchionian body consists of a prolonga- tion of the cerebral arachnoid enclosing sub-arachnoid tissue, the loculi of which communicate with the sub-arachnoid space. The observations of Luschka and Cleland have proved that villous processes invariably grow from the free surface of that membrane, and that when these villi greatly increase in size they form the bodies in question. Some- times the Pacchionian bodies greatly hypertrophy, occasion absorption of the bones of the cranial vault, depressions

ANATOMY. 414 laries it becomes venous blood, and in that condition flows into the systemic veins, right auricle, right ventricle, pul- monary system of arteries, and pulmonary capillaries. THE AETEEIES. These vessels were named arteries by the older anato- mists, on the supposition, now known to be erroneous, that they contained air. The "term artery is now employed to express a blood-vessel, which, arising either directly or indirectly from the heart, conveys blood away from that organ into a network of capillaries. Arteries divide and subdivide into smaller vessels in their course, and to the individual branches descriptive names are applied. Some of these names express the position of an artery, as sub- clavian, axillary; others, the organ in which it is distri- buted, as pulmonary, hepatic; others a peculiarity in its course, as circumflex, coronary. The branches of arteries may be either collateral or terminal. The collateral branches arise from the sides of the parent artery either at an acute, a right, or an obtuse angle. Terminal branches arise at an acute angle by the bifurcation of the parent artery, which is the most common form, or by the breaking up of the artery into a cluster of branches. An artery does not diminish in calibre from the origin of one branch to the origin of the next succeeding branch. The calibre of each branch is less than that of the stem from which it arises, but the sum of the calibre of the different branches is greater than that of the stem from which they spring. Branches which arise either from the same artery or

ANATOMY. 370 by a plate of bone, the osseous spiral lamina, which, spring- ing from the modiolus, winds spirally around it, and pro- jects into the tube. When the membranous cochlea is in its place, the division is completed by a membrane, the membranous spiral lamina, or basilar membrane, which bridges across the interval between the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina and the outer wall of the tube, to the latter of which it is attached by the spiral cochlear ligament, which contains elastic fibres radiating from the basilar membrane. These passages are called scala tympani and scala vestibuli. The vestibular border of the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina terminates in a denti- culated spiral crest, the limbus or crista spi- Fig. 109.—Diagram of the Membranous Labyrinth. fCtlis.

The membrane of Reissner is formed of delicate vascular con- nective tissue, with an epithelial layer on each of its two surfaces. The scala tympani or lower passage, widest at the base of the cochlea, begins at the inner wall of the tympanum, into which it would have opened through the fenestra rotunda, had not the fenestra been closed up by a membrane. The scala vestibuli or upper passage, also widest at the base, communicates with the cavity of tho osseous vestibule. At the apex of the cochlea these two

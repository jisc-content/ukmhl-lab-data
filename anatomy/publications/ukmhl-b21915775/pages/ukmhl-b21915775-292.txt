276 ANATOMY. volution behind the vertical part of the parieto-occipital fissure belongs to the inner surface of the occipital lobe, and forms the cuneus or occipital lobule (fig. 89). The cuneus is bounded below by the calcarine fissure which passes almost horizontally backwards from the lower end of the parieto-occipital fissure : the calcar avis in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle is the elevation which corre- sponds to this fissure. Bounding the calcarine fissure below is the gyrus lingualis, which also belongs to the occipital lobe. Bounding the gyrus lingualis below is the collateral or ocdpito-temporal fissure; it separates that gyrus and the gyrus hippocampi from the ocdpito-temporal gyrus. The convolution which extends forwards from the parieto-occipital fissure along the margin of the-longitudinal fissure to the anterior end of the hemisphere, and which then turns back to the locus perforatus anticus, has been named the marginal convolution. But this convolution is divided into sections. The part immediately in front of the parieto-occipital fissure belongs to the parietal lobe, and is the precuneus or quadrilateral lobule. This lobule is separated by the posterior end of the calloso-marginal fissure from the paracentral lobule, which belongs mostly to the upper end of the ascending frontal, but partly to that of the ascending parietal convolution. The remainder of the marginal convolution is the median surface of the superior frontal convolution. The calloso-marginal sulcus separates the paracentral lobule and median part of the superior frontal convolution from the callosal convolution. /. The convolutions on the inner and tentorial surface of the hemisphere, which cannot be referred to auy of the previously described lobes, have recently been named by Broca the great limbic lobe, but havo long been known as

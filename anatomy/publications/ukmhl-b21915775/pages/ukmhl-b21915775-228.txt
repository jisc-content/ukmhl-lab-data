212 ANATOMY. Membranes op Brain and Spinal Cord. The brain and spinal cord are invested by three mem- branes or Meninges, which lie between them and the bones that form the walls of the cranial cavity and spinal canal. The membranes are named from without inwards dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Dura mater.â€”The most external membrane, named dura from its firmness, consists of a cranial and a spinal division. The Cranial division or endocranium is in contact with the inner table of the cranial bones; it is adherent along the lines of the sutures and to the margins of the foramina which transmit the nerves, more especially to the foramen magnum, and it gives sheaths to the cranial nerves. It forms, therefore, for these bones an internal periosteum, and the meningeal arteries which ramify in it are the nutrient arteries of the inner table. As the growth of bone is more active in infancy and youth than in the adult, the adhesion between the dura mater and the cranial bones is greater in early life than at maturity. When not adherent to the bones, capillary intervals or epidural spaces exist between it and them, and these intervals correspond to the subperiosteal lymph spaces of other bones, j From the inner surface of the dura mater strong flattened bands pass into the cranial cavity, and form partitions between certain of the divisions of the brain. A vertical longitudinal mesial band, named, from its sickle shape, falx cerebri, dips between the two hemispheres of the cerebrum, and stretches from the crista galli to the internal occipital protuberance. A smaller sickle-shaped vertical mesial band, the falx cerebelli, attached to the internal occipital crest, passes between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. A large band arches forward in the horizontal

44 ANATOMY. Middle, Piing, and Little fingers. The skeleton consists of fourteen bones, named Phalanges, of which the thumb possesses two, and each of the four fingers three. The phalanx next the metacarpal bone is the first, that which carries the nail is the terminal or ungual phalanx, whilst the intermediate bone is the second phalanx. Each is a miniature long bone, with two articular extremities and an intermediate shaft, except the terminal phalanges, which have an articular surface only at their proximal ends, the distal end being rounded and rough, to afford a surface for the lodgment of the nail. LOWER LIMB. The Inferior or Pelvic Extremity, or Lower Limb, consists of a proximal part or Haunch, a distal part or Foot, and an intermediate Shaft subdivided into thigh and leg. Each part has its appropriate skeleton : in the haunch, the pel- vic or innomi- nate bone ; in the thigh, the j-IG yo.â€”Diagrammatic Transverse Section to represent n . , the relations of the Pelvic Girdle to the Trunk.

The bone of the haunch forms an arch or Pelvic Girdle, which articulates behind with the side of the sacrum, and arches forward to articulate with the opposite haunch bone at the pubic symphysis. It is the direct medium of con-

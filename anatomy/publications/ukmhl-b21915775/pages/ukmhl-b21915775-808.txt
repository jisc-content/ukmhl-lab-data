ANATOMY. 792 of the deeper lymphatics is not known. Nerves accom- pany the blood-vessels into the kidney : they arise from the renal plexus of the sympathetic nerve, which is joined by the smallest splanchnic nerve. THE URETERS. The Ureters are two tubular ducts, which convey the urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Each ureter arises at the hilus of its kidney from the dilated pelvis formed by the junction of the calices. The ureter is about fifteen inches long, and descends behind the peri- toneum covering the posterior wall of the abdomen into the pelvis, where it runs forward to reach the base of the bladder, the wall of which it pierces obliquely before opening into its cavity by a slit-like orifice (fig. 218). Structure.â€”The ureter possesses several coats. The ex- ternal is a tunica adventitia formed of connective tissue : within this is a muscular coat of non-striped fibre arranged in three layers, of which the internal and external layers are longitudinal, and the middle layer is circular. The internal coat is a mucous membrane, and between it and the mus- cular coat is the submucous coat. The epithelium cover- ing the mucous coat resembles that of the bladder to be immediately described. Where the calices embrace tbe papillary apices of the medullary pyramids of the kidney, the tunica adventitia of the cortex is continuous with the adjacent fibrous coat of the kidney, and the mucous lining is prolonged upon the surface of the papilla. The longi- tudinal muscular fibres disappear near the attached border

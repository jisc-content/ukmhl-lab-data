29 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. its inner surface for the lateral venous blood sinus, and hollowed out within into the mastoid cells, or air-sinuses, which communicate with the tympanum or middle ear; it articulates with the occipital. The petrous-temporal is distinguished by its stony hardness, and has the form of a three-sided pyramid. Its apex lies in relation to the side of the body of the sphenoid; its base corresponds to the tympanic cavity and external meatus; its under surface is rough, and forms a part of the under surface of the skull; its anterior and posterior surfaces are smooth and within the cranial cavity. Its upper border is grooved for the superior petrosal blood sinus, its lower border for the inferior petrosal. The petrous part of the bone is traversed by a canal which transmits the internal carotid artery and sympathetic nervous cord into the cranial cavity; in its pos- terior surface is a passage, internal meatus, down which the 7th cranial nerve proceeds; at the bottom of the meatus the auditory part of that nerve enters the internal ear, whilst the facial part of the nerve which goes to the muscles of the face traverses a canal in the bone, called aqueduct of Fallopius, which ends externally, between the styloid and mastoid processes, in the stylo-mastoid foramen. The styloid process is a slender part of the bone which projects down- wards from the vaginal process of the tympanic plate, and is joined to the small cornu of the hyoid bone by the stylo- hyoid ligament. It consists of two elements, a tympano- hyal and a stylo-hyal, and does not unite with the rest of the bone until a comparatively late period. The petrous- temporal and ex-occipital articulate, but between them is the jugular foramen, which transmits out of the skull the 8th cranial nerve and the internal jugular vein. The fourteen bones of the Face are, as a rule, much smaller

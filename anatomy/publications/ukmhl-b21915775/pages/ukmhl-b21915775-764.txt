The central pair of upper incisors are larger than the lateral: whilst the lateral pair of lower incisors are larger than the central pair, which are the smallest incisor teeth. The crowns of the incisor teeth are chisel-shaped, and adapted for biting and cutting the food; the anterior or labial surface is convex, the posterior, palatal, or lingual surface is con- cave. When the crown is first erupted the cutting edge is minutely serrated, but the serrations soon wear down by use. The fangs are long and single; being in the upper incisors round and fusiform, in the lower laterally compressed, and sometimes marked by a longitudinal groove. Although the human incisors are, as the name implies, cutting, chisel-shaped teeth, in many mammals the incisors are greatly modified in form, as for example in the tusks of the elephant. The determination of the incisor teeth does not depend, therefore, on their form, but on their position in the jaws. The name incisor is given to the teeth situated in the pre-maxillary portion of the upper jaw, and in the anterior end of the lower jaw, whatever their shape may be. The Canine or Unicuspid Teeth, four in number, one on each side of the mesial plane of each jaw, are placed next the lateral incisors. They are bigger than the incisor teeth, and the upper canines, which are sometimes called the eye-teeth, are larger than the lower; the fangs of the upper canines are lodged in deep sockets in the superior maxillse, which extend towards the floor of each orbit. The crowns of these teeth are thick and conical, convex on the labial surface, concave on the lingual; the fangs

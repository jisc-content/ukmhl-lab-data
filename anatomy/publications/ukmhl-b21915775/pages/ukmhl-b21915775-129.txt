CHAPTER III. ANATOMY OF THE TEXTURES OR TISSUES. Introductory. Before proceeding to the description of the other organic systems of which the human body is built up, it may be well to enter into the consideration of the minute or micro- scopic structure of its constituent parts. These parts may primarily be divided into Fluids and Solids. The fluids are the blood, the lymph, the chyle, the secretions of the various glands, and of the serous and synovial membranes. The solids form the framework of the several organic systems, and assume different appearances in different localities. Sometimes they are arranged in compact solid masses, as in cartilage; at others they are elongated into fine threads or fibres, as in muscle, tendon, nerve; at others they are expanded into thin membranes, as in the fascise or aponeu- roses, the serous, synovial, and mucous membranes; at others they are hollowed out into distinct tubes for the con- veyance of fluids, as in the blood-vessels, the lymph and chyle vessels, and the ducts of glands. To the solids of the body, whatever their form may be, the general name of Tissues or Textures is applied. Each organic system may be regarded as in the main composed of a tissue or texture peculiar to and characteristic of itself. Thus, the bones are essentially composed of the osseous tissue, the H

THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. taking the brain out of the cranial cavity this commissure is usually more or less torn through, and the cavity is con sequently enlarged. The 'posterior white commissure consists of nerve fibres, which pass transversely between the two thalami, immediately in front of the corpora quadrigemina. The anterior white commissure ^lies transversely in front of the anterior pillars of the fornix and passes through the corpora striata. The 3rd ventricle communicates in front, through the foramen of Monro, with the lateral ventricles, and behind with the aqueduct of Sylvius. The Pineal Body, or Epiphysis cerebri, is a reddish cone-shaped body, enveloped by the velum interpositum, and situated on the nates at the posterior and upper part of the 3rd ventricle. From its anterior end two white bands, the peduncles of the pineal body, pass forwards, one on the inner side of each optic thalamus, where they blend apparently with the strise medullares. Its structure is described on p. 574. • Internal Structure of the Cerebrum. The Cerebrum or developed Anterior Cerebral Vesicle consists both of grey and white matter;, the general rela- tions of these two forms of nerve matter to each other may be seen by making sections through the cerebrum. The determination, however, of their minute structure, and of the relations and connections of the nerve fibres to the nerve cells is, owing to the delicacy of the organ, one of the most difficult departments of anatomical study. The Grey Matter of the cerebrum is disposed in three great groups : a, The grey matter of the cortex of the hemispheres; b, the grey matter of the ganglia at the base of the cerebrum; c, the central grey matter which

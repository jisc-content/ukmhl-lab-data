572 ANATOMY. the investing capsule, and end in a capillary plexus, which is distributed in the trabecular framework of connective tissue ; and the meshes of the capillary plexus correspond in their general arrangement with that of the connective tissue in which they ramify. Arnold states that they form glomeruli in the zona glomerulosa, elongated meshes in the zona fasciculata, and a line network in the zona reticularis and in the medulla. In the medullary part the large capsular vein arises, and smaller veins spring .from the capillaries of the cortical part. Lymph vessels have been seen to leave the supra-renal glands, but their distri- bution in them is not known. Nerves are very abundantly distributed to the gland : they are derived from the renal, capsular, and phrenic plexuses of the sympathetic, and from the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves; so abundant are they, indeed, that Bergmann and Luschka consider the glands to be more intimately associated with the nervous system than with any of the other organic systems. They traverse both the cortical and medullary parts of the organ, and have nerve cells associated with them. Small detached accessory supra-renal glands are sometimes seen. The function of the supra-renal glands is not fully ascer- tained. A curious correlation between pathological changes in these bodies and a bronzed hue of the skin, accom- panied by emaciation and debility, has been pointed out by Addison.

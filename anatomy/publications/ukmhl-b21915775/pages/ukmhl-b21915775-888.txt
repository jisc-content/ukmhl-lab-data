872 ANATOMY. marked by a pellucid spot named the umbilicus or scar. The ovum is thus enclosed in a distinct chamber, the ovigerous or ovular chamber, and the decidua reflexa shuts off the ovum from the general cavity of the uterus. The free surface of the decidua reflexa, except at and close to the scar, is perforated by the mouths of the enlarged utri- cular glands. Dilated veins continuous with those in the decidua uteri are prolonged into the decidua reflexa. The portion of the decidua uterina, forming the surface of the area to which the ovum becomes attached, under- goes a great development, forms the maternal part of the placenta, and is named the decidua 'placewtcdis or the decidua serotina. In two specimens which I examined at about the 3rd or 4th week of utero-gestation, I found the surface of the decidua serotina next the ovular chamber to be subdivided into shallow irregular spaces, occupied by the villi of the chorion. The decidua was nearly ~ths inch in thickness, and had a loose spongy appearance. On making vertical sections it was seen to contain numerous cells, some of which were polygonal, others rouuded, and of large size, and with large nuclei ; others were caudate, and between the cells was a delicately fibrillated connective tissue. Amidst this cellulated tissue numerous dilated vessels were also seen in section, many of which were entirely, or to a large extent, filled with blood corpuscles. These dilated vessels were neither arteries nor veins, but dilated capillaries, for they possessed merely a simple cellular wall, fused with that of the tissue in which they were situated. At this early period of gestation, therefore, the capillaries of the uterine mucosa in the placental area exhibited a sinus-like dilatation. Here and there an utri-

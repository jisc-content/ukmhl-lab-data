85 MUSCLES OF EXPRESSION. Numerous muscles are situated immediately beneath the skin of the scalp and face, and are not of so deep red a colour as the muscles of the trunk and limbs. They arise from the bones of the head, and are inserted into the deep surface of the skin itself, and when they contract they move the skin of the scalp and face. As they are the instruments through which the various passions and emotions are expressed, they are grouped together as the Muscles of Expression. The Scalp and Eyebrows are moved by the occipito-frontalis and corrugatores muscles. The occipito-frontalis passes from the superior curved lines of the occipital bone over the vertex to the forehead ; when it contracts, the skin of the forehead is wrinkled transversely, the eyebrows are elevated, and an expression of amazement or surprise is produced. Some persons have a greater power over this muscle than others, and by the alternate contraction of its occipital and frontal portions can move the hairy scalp to and fro with great rapidity. A corrugator supercilii arises from each superciliary ridge, on the frontal bone, to be inserted into the Eyebrows : they draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards, wrinkle the skin of the forehead longitudinally, and contract with great vigour in the act of frowning. The Auricle of the external ear has three small muscles inserted into it, one behind, the posterior auricular, one above, the superior, one in front, the anterior: in man, as a rule, these muscles are feeble, and have little action; but in many mammals they are large, and by them the animal pricks its ears to detect the faintest sound of danger. The Eyelids are drawn together, so as to close the eye as in the act of sleep, by the orbicularis palpebrarum, the fibres of which lie in the eyelids and on the borders of the orbit, and surround

845 UTERUS. sents therefore, as J. Williams has stated, the muscularis mucosae of the alimentary mucous membrane. The glands are lined by a columnar epithelium. In 1846 Allen Thomson observed, though he did not record the fact, that the epithelial lining of the uterine glands in the sow was ciliated. In 1852 Leydig published an account of the ciliated epithelium of the glands in this animal. Since that time Lott has recognised it in the cow, sheep, rabbit, mouse, and bat, and more recently Friedlander and J. Williams have observed it in the human female. The interglandular connective tissue contains multitudes of oval and elliptical corpuscles, which from their number give a marked character to the structure. In this tissue are distributed small arteries and veins, united together by a capillary plexus, which is distributed around the tubular glands. The uterus receives its supply of blood from the two ovarian branches of the aorta and the two uterine branches of the internal iliac arteries. The uterine arteries reach the uterus at the sides of the cervix, and ascend in relation to the borders of attachment of the broad ligament, giving off numerous branches into the muscular wall. The ovarian arteries enter the folds of the broad liga- ments, and not only give branches to the ovaries and Fallopian tubes, but send each a large branch to the side of the uterus, which supplies its wall in the region of the fundus, and freely inosculates with the uterine artery. The branches of the arteries in the muscular wall are tortuous, and the number and tortuosity of the branches increase greatly during pregnancy. The uterus is provided with numerous veins, which are thin walled, without valves,

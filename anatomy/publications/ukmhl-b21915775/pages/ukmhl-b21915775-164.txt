ANATOMY. 148 tlie fibrils in each bundle lie almost parallel to each other. The bundles also in some cases are parallel, though in others they cross at various angles. The fibrils in each bundle, as well as the bundles themselves, are cemented together; the firmness of the adhesion varies in the different modifications of the fibrous con- nective tissue, being much more decided in the tendons, ligaments, and fasciae, than in the lax areolar tissue. It is important to determine the relation which the cells of the connective tissue bear of white Fibres to the bundles of white fibres, and on this of Connective Tissue. point the researches of Ranvier have thrown much light. He has pointed out that the fixed cell plates occupy the interstices between the fasciculi, and are moulded on the outer surface of the bundles. He, Thin, Axel Key, Retzius, and Mihalkovics have shown that this Fig. 40.â€”Cells investing the primary bundles of tendo Achillis of n Sheep, {From Thin) arrangement applies to the bundles in the lax areolar tissue as well as to those in the firmer tendon, though it does not follow that each bundle has a complete covering of flattened cells. Microscopic interstices exist between the fasciculi of the connective tissue, which are bounded by the flattened cells moulded on the surface of the bundles. In transverse sections through tendons these interstices assume a stellate appearance and are seen to anastomose with each other,

2fi0 ANATOMY. Fourth Ventricle.—This ventricle is the dilated central canal of the posterior cerebral vesicle, and it forms a space shaped like a heraldic lozenge. The lower half of the lozenge is on the back of the medulla oblongata, and is bounded laterally by the restiform bodies and posterior pyramids, as they diverge from the postero-median fissure outwards to the cerebellum. The upper half is on the Fig. 83.—Floor of tlie Fourth Ventricle and todjacent structures. 1, pineal gland ; 2, the nates, and 3, the testes of the corpora quadrigemina; 4, 4, middle peduncles; 5, 5, superior peduncles of the cerebellum ; 9, 9, inferior peduncles of the cerebellum or restiform bodies, the figures being placed on the funiculus cuneatus; 6, 6, valve of Vieussens divided ; 7, 7, fasciculi teretes ; 8,8, roots of the auditory nerves; 9', corpus dentotum; 10, 10, posterior pyramids, the figures being placed on the clavai; 11, calamus scriptorius. back of the pons, and is bounded laterally by the superior peduncles of the cerebellum which converge to the corpora quadrigemina. The inferior angle, calamus scriptorius, lies between the clavse of the two diverging posterior pyramids, and is closed in by a thin layer, of white matter, the obex, which passes between the two clavm. The superior angle communicates with the aqueduct of Sylvius. The lateral

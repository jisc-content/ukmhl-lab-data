ANATOMY. 754 crusta petrosa, and sometimes named the granular layer, is apparently of the same nature as the interglobular spaces. The Enamel is the brilliant white layer which forms a cap on the surface of the crown of a tooth. It is thickest on the cutting edge or grinding surface of the crown, and thins away towards the neck, where it disappears. It is not only the hardest part of a tooth, but the hardest tissue in the body, and con- sists of 9 6 '5 per cent, of earthy and of 3-5 per cent, of animal mattei’. The earthy matter consists almost entirely of salts of lime. The great hardness of the enamel admirably adapts it as a covering for the cutting edge, or grinding surfaces, of the crowns of the teeth. When sections are made through the enamel perpendi- cular to the surface of the crown, it is seen to be composed of microscopic rods, named the enamel fibres, or enamel jyrisms. These rods are set side by side in close contact with each other; one end of each rod rests on the surface of the dentine, the other reaches the free surface of the crown. The rods do not all lie parallel to each other, for whilst some are straight, others are sinuous, and the latter seem Fig. 20G.—1, Vertical section through the Enamel and immediately sub- jacent Dentine. e, enamel rods; d, branched termination of dentine tubes. 2, transverse section through the enamel rods. 3, transverse sec- tion through dentine tubes and matrix, x 300.

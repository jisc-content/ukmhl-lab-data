ANATOMY. 142 the serous membrane. Scattered irregularly over this surface are the minute orifices, or stomata, which open into lymphatic vessels. The cells which surround the stomata differ in form and appearance from the ordinary endothelium ; they are smaller, and are poly- hedral, their contents are granu- lar, and the nucleus is more Fig. 34.â€”Endothelial Cells from ,. the Peritoneal Serous Membrane, distinct. Three stomata may be seen sur- rounded by polyhedral nucleated The endothelium lining the cells; the one to the right is closed. The light band marks the position. Lymphatic Vessels consists of of a vertical lymphatic vessel. {After mein). a layer 0f flattened cells, vhich are elongated and sinuous in outline. The endothelium of the lymphatics is continuous with that of the serous mem- branes through the stomata, so that the cavities of the serous membranes are now regarded as great lymph-sacs. The endothelial lining of the Blood-Vessels corresponds in general characters with that of the lymphatics. In the small blood capillaries the cells are fusiform; in those of large size more irregular: in the veins they are broader, more irregular, and less distinctly fusiform than in the arteries. The endothelial covering of the endocardial lining of the heart consists of a layer of flattened cells with irregular outlines. The endothelial lining of the blood- vascular system is continuous with that of the lymph- vascular system, at the openings of the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts into the great veins, and thus a continuity of surface is established between the serous membranes and the lining membrane of the blood-vascular system through the lymphatics. The endothelium of the Synovial Membranes forms a

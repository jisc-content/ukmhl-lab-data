214 ANATOMY. sinuses are numerous veins, which convey from the brain the blood that has been circulating through it. Two of these sinuses, called cavernous, lie at the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone, and receive the ophthalmic veins from the eyeballs situated in the orbital cavities. The two cavernous sinuses are connected by vessels which cross the pituitary fossa in front of and behind the pituitary body, and are called the circular sinus. A spheno-parietal sinus lies under the lesser wing of the sphenoid and joins the cavernous sinus. Several blood sinuses pass from before backwards : a superior longitudinal along the upper border of the falx cerebri, from the crista galli to the internal occipital protuberance; an inferior longitudinal along its lower border as far as the tentorium, where it joins the straight sinus, which runs along the middle of the tentorium as far as the same protuberance. The straight sinus also receives the veins of Galen and the superior cere- bellar veins. One or two small occipital simises, which lie in the falx cerebelli, also pass to join the straight and longi- tudinal sinuses opposite this protuberance; several currents of blood meet, therefore, at this spot, and as Herophilus supposed that a sort of whirlpool was formed in the blood, the name torcular Herophili has been used to express this confluence of these sinuses. From the torcular the blood is drained away by two large sinuses, named lateral, which curve forwards and downwards to the jugular foramina to terminate in the internal jugular veins. In its course each lateral sinus receives two petrosal sinuses, a superior and an inferior, which pass from the cavernous sinus backwards along the upper and lower borders of the petrous part of the temporal bone (see p. 510). The Spinal division of the dura mater hangs loosely in

176 ANATOMY. or fasciculi, which, are not aggregated together into such compact red masses as in the voluntary muscles, but are of a paler red colour, and are set farther apart, and often cross and interlace with each other in the walls of the tubes and hollow viscera, in which this form of muscle is found. The fasciculi are sepa- rated from each other by a delicate, areolar connective tissue, or perimysium. The size of the fasciculi varies in different localities ; in the hollow viscera they are so large that their arrangement can be observed with the naked eye; but in the skin, the walls of gland-ducts, &c., they can only be seen with the aid of the micro- scope. If a fasciculus be carefully torn „ „ , , up with needles it can be resolved into its Fig. 58.—A, a fasci- L cuius of mm-striped constituent fibres, and the number of the muscular fibre; B, ’ an isolated muscu- g^res varies with the size of the fasciculus, lar fibre cell, more highly magnified, non_striped fibres are pale and almost colourless, with soft, ill-defined outlines, from yy^gth to Twcth inch in diameter; they are rounded in form ‘or laterally compressed, and are so easily flattened by artificial pressure, that they have erroneously been regarded as flat or ribbon-shaped fibres. When digested for a few hours in dilute nitric or hydrochloric acid, and sometimes even without any reagent, they are seen to be elongated fusiform cells—the contractile fibro-cells of Kblliker—which vary in length from yiyth to y^j-th inch, and which taper off usually into attenuated ends. In the middle of each cell is a characteristically elongated, rod-shaped fusiform nucleus within which is a plexus of fine fibrils. The cell protoplasm is finely granular, or faintly [longitudinally

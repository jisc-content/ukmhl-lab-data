252 ANATOMY. the floor of the 4th ventricle about 3 millimetres above the calamus scrip- torius has been localised by Dittmar as the general vaso-motor centre, so that it regulates the blood pressure throughout the vascular system. Further, its nerve cells give origin to fibres which participate in the formation of the areiform and longitudinal tracts of the medulla. As a conductor it transmits impulses both downwards from the higher divisions of the encephalon to the spinal cord, and upwards from the cord to the higher encephalon. Thus the cord is brought into anatomico- physiologieal continuity through the medulla with the cerebellum, corpora quadrigemina, pons, crura cerebri, and cerebrum. PONS. The Pons Varolii or Bridge (fig. 78),.is cuboidal in form; its anterior convex surface rests upon the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid, and is marked by a median basilar groove j its inferior surface receives the pyramidal tracts of the medulla oblongata; from its superior surface emerge the two crura cerebri; each lateral surface is in relation to a hemisphere of the cerebellum, and the cms cerebelli ad pontem (middle peduncle) passes from each hemisphere into the pions; the posterior surface forms in part the upper portion of the floor of the 4th ventricle, and in part is connected with the corpora quadrigemina. The pons consists of both white and grey matter. The nerve fibres of the white matter pass both in a transverse and a longitudinal direction. The transverse fibres go between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum ; some are situated on the anterior surface of the pons, and form its superficial transverse fibres, whilst others pass through its substance and form the deep transverse fibres. The transverse fibres of the pons constitute, therefore, the commissure through which the two hemispheres of the cerebellum are anatomically continuous with each other. By the decussation of these fibres in the mesial plane a

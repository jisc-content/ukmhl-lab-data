LIVER. 735 between the layers of the suspensory ligament, anastomose with the epigastric branch of the internal mammary artery. c, interlobular branches of the hepatic artery lie along with the interlobular branches of the portal vein, and end in the capillary network within the lobules. The hepatic vein arises within the substance of the liver from the intra-lobular capillaries. In the centre of each lobule is the intra-lobular or central vein. It traverses the axis of the lobule, and leaves it to join a small vein run- ning immediately under the bases of adjacent lobules, which, from its position, is named the sub-lobular vein. Adjacent sub-lobu. lar veins then join together, and form larger vessels which are the trunks of the hepatic vein, or the hepatic venous canals. These trunks run towards the posterior border of the liver, and open into the inferior vena cava. The sub-lobular veins and hepatic venous trunks differ from the branches of the portal vein in the following particulars :—They are not accompanied by other vessels ; they are not invested by Glisson’s capsule, and are more or less closely adherent to the surrounding lobules; they gape, and do not collapse when the liver is cut through; their coats are so thin that Fig. 201.—Vertical section through two hepatic Lobules of a pig. c, c, central veins receiving the intra-lobular capillaries, s, sub-lobular vein, cl, interlobular connective tissue forming thelcapsules of the lobules; i, i, interlobular veins.

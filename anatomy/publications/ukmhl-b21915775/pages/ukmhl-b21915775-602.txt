ANATOMY. 586 blast. The anterior lobe, as has been shown by the recent observa- tions of W. Muller, Gotte, and Mihalkovics, is an upward prolon- gation from the upper part of the back of the embryo mouth, in front of the anterior end of the chorda dorsalis. This buccal pro- longation is continuous with the epiblast lining of the mouth, but is subsequently cut off from it by the growth of the cartilaginous floor of the skull. The two lobes then fuse together into a single organ, which is lodged in the pituitary fossa of the sphenoid bone. The development of the Pineal gland has not been definitely ascertained; but from its relation to the optic thalami it evidently arises in connection with the thalami from the thalamencephalon, or posterior division of the anterior cerebral vesicle. As it is so closely invested by the pia mater, some have supposed that it might be developed in connection with that membrane.

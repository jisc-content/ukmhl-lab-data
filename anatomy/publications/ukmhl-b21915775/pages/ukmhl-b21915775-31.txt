15 AXIAL SKELETON—SPINE. bones are rudimentary and there are no hind limbs, there is no sacrum. The sacrum forms the posterior wall of the pelvis, is triangular in form, and possesses two surfaces, two borders, a base, and an apex. The anterior or pelvic surface is concave, and marked by four transverse lines, which indicate its original division into five bones, and by four pairs of foramina, through which are transmitted the anterior sacral nerves. Its posterior surface is convex, and corresponds to the spines and laminrn of the true vertebrae; in the middle line are the rudimentary spines, on each side of which are two rows of tubercles, the inner are the conjoined articular and mammillary processes, the outer the transverse processes of the originally distinct vertebrae : in addition, four pairs of foramina transmit the posterior sacral nerves from the sacral canal, which extends through the bone from base to apex, and forms the lower end of the spinal canal By its borders the sacrum articulates with the haunch-bones, by i ts base with the last lumbar vertebra, by its apex with the coccyx. The human sacrum is broader in proportion to its length than in other mammals; this great breadth gives solidity to the lower part of the spine, and, conjoined with the size of the lateral articular surfaces, it permits a more perfect junction with the haunch-bones, and is correlated with the erect position. Owing to the need in woman for a wide pelvis, the sacrum is broader than in man. The Coccyx consists of only four vertebra in the human spine. It is the rudimentary tail, but instead of projecting back, as in mammals generally, is curved forwards, and is not visible externally, an arrangement which is also found in the anthropoid apes and in Hoffmann’s sloth. In the spider monkeys as many as thirty-three vertebra are found

ANATOMY. 736 the lobules can be seen through them ; they have no rela- tion to the transverse fissure. From this description of the vascular arrangements •within the liver, it will be seen that the intra-lobular capil- laries are continuous with three vascular trunks, two which carry blood to them, the portal vein and the hepatic artery ; one which conveys the blood away from them, the hepatic vein. The communication in each case is so free that the capillaries can be artificially injected from any one of these vessels. The secreting cells of the liver, hepatic cells, form the proper parenchyma of the organ. They are situated within the lobules, and occupy the spaces of the capillary network. The cells vary in diameter from -g-^th to y-gb^th inch ; they have the form of irregular polyhedrons, with from four to seven sides, and with the angles sometimes sharp, at others rounded. They do not appear to possess definite walls, but have a distinct nucleus. The cell pro- toplasm is granular, and usually contains fat drops and yellow particles, apparently bile pigment. Colourless gra- nules, believed to be gly- cogenic, are also infiltrated through the protoplasm. Amoeboid movements have been observed to take place in these cells, when isolated from each other. W. Krause states that fusiform cells sometimes lie between the polyhedral cells.

ANATOMY. 710 lymphoid tissue, as has been described on p. 548, where an account of the arrangement of their blood-vessels and lymph-vessels has also been given. The solitary and Peyer’s glands, as is the case generally with the lymphoid organs, are more distinct and perfect in structure in infancy and childhood, than in adults or in advanced age. Peyer’s glands are the seats of tubercular formation in tubercular disease of the intestine; and they become swollen and ulcerated in the typhoid form of continued fever. The changes which take place in these glands in the course of typhoid ulceration is due, as was pointed out by Goodsir, to the great development of cells within the constituent follicles of a patch, which in consequence burst and give rise to an ulcerated surface.

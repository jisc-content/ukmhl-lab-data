ANATOMY. 690 the pylorus, they become more closely aggregated, so as to form a thick layer, which at the pylorus extends into the pyloric valve, and forms the sphincter pylori muscle. The circular fibres of the stomach are in the same morphological plane as the circular fibres of the oesophagus and duode- num. The inner layer consists of oblique fasciculi, which are not found over the entire organ ; the greater number spring from the left side of the cardiac orifice, and radiate on the anterior and posterior surfaces towards the pylorus and greater curvature. Henle and Pettigrew have described a group of short oblique fasciculi as spreading from the right side of the cardiac orifice over the anterior and pos- terior surfaces of the fundus, and the latter author has described oblique fibres investing the pylorus ; Pettigrew indeed considers that the circular layer consists of very oblique fibres intersecting each other in figure of eight loops. These oblique fibres by their contraction approxi- mate the cardia to the pylorus, the great curvature to the smaller, and the anterior to the posterior wall : they are thus the true grinding muscles of the stomach, and have been compared to the muscular gizzard of the bird. From the relation of the two groups of oblique fibres to the cardiac orifice they probably close that opening during gastric digestion. The longitudinal and circular fibres occasion a longitudinal shortening and transverse con- striction of the stomach. By the action of the muscular coat the food is churned about in the stomach, so as to become thoroughly intermingled with the gastric juice. The contraction of the sphincter pylori closes the pyloric orifice, and prevents the passage of the food into the duodenum, before it is converted into chyme.

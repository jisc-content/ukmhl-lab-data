875 PLACENTA. of the crypts in the placenta of the pig, fox, bitch, sheep, and other mammals. The bands of decidua principally consist of large, dis- tinctly nucleated, rounded or polygonal cells, lying in a delicately fibrillated connective tissue. The more slender offshoots contain, at their origin, similar cells, but to a large extent are made up of delicate fibrillated connective tissue containing scattered corpuscles. Although this tissue is often in close apposition to the villi, it may be separated from it by appreciable intervals, and, from its extreme delicacy, has the appearance as if it were being so attenu- ated by the growth and expansion of the placenta, that it is undergoing atrophy. The maternal blood-vessels, the capillaries of which, as already stated, have dilated into sinuses, are also prolonged into the placenta, along with the cellular structures of the decidua serotina, so that the dilated vessels of the modified uterine mucous membrane are brought into relation with the vascular villi of the foetal chorion. In the placenta, at and near the full time, the growth and expansion of the organ have made so great an ad- vance, that the original relations of its foetal and maternal constituents have become greatly modified, so that some observers have questioned, though erroneously, if maternal structures enter at all into its internal construction. The Mature Placenta presents the appearance of a disc- shaped spongy cake, from 7 to 9 inches in diameter, and about 1 inch thick about its centre, where the umbilical cordis continuous with its chorionic surface; towards its circumference it is always somewhat thinner. Its inner or chorionic surface shows the ramifications of the umbilical

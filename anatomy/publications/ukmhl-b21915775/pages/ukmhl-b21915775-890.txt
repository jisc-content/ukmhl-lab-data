874 ANATOMY. This arrangement applies also to the human placenta; for the utricular glands, which open, on the free surface of the decidua serotina, into the ovular chamber, are much fewer than the villi of the chorion attached to that surface of the chamber; whilst the uterine glands in the decidua reflexa open on that surface of the decidua which is next the general cavity of the uterus. The up-growths of the decidua around the villi of the human chorion are com- parable therefore with the foldings of the uterine mucosa, which in the cat, pig, cow, and other mammals constitute the walls of the crypts in which the villi are lodged. But the interlocking of the foetal and maternal parts of the human placenta may be advantageously studied at a later stage of development. About the 5th month, when the decidua reflexa and the villi connected with the non- placental area of the chorion have atrophied, whilst the villi in the placental area have undergone a great increase, both in length and in the number of branches, the placenta has then assumed a definite discoid form. Well-marked bars or dissepiments of decidua serotina pass through the thickness of the placenta as far as the chorion, and divide it into lobes or cotyledons. Numbers of more slender decidual bands pass into the substance of each lobe, partly from the surfaces of the dissepiments, and partly from the general surface of the serotina between the dissepiments. These bands give rise to still more delicate offshoots, which form a microscopic intraplacental trabecular arrangement in the interspaces of which the villi are lodged. These intraplacental prolongations of the decidua are applied to the stems and branches of the chorionic villi, and the inter- spaces containing the villi are comparable to the cavities

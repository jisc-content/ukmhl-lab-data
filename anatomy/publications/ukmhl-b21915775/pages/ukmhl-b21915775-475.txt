459 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. middle cerebral arteries. At its origin in the neck it lies in the anterior triangular space, and is covered only by the skin, platysma, and cervical fascia ; but as it ascends it becomes more deeply placed, and the posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, the hypoglossal nerve, the external carotid and occipital arteries, the parotid gland, the stylo- glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, stylo-hyoid liga- ment, glosso-pharyngeal nerve and pharyngeal branches of the nervus vagus are between it and the surface. It lies in front of the rectus capitis anticus major muscle and the cervical vertebrae. To its outer side is the internal jugular vein, whilst the vagus nerve and the cord of the sympa- thetic are behind it. In the carotid canal and cranial cavity the artery is accompanied by the ascending prolongation of the gan- gliated cord of the sympathetic, which forms the carotid and cavernous plexuses around the artery. On the side of the body of the sphenoid it lies on the inner wall of the eavernous blood sinus, and has the sixth cranial nerve in contact with its outer surface; whilst the third and fourth cranial nerves, and the ophthalmic division of the fifth lie in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus. Close to the ante- rior clinoid process it pierces the dura mater, and becomes covered by the visceral arachnoid prior to its termination. No branch arises from the internal carotid in the neck. In the carotid canal a small tympanic branch arises, which enters the tympanum. When in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus minute branches, named arteries receptaculi, pass to the walls of the sinus; but the chief branches of the internal carotid are to the eyeball and other contents of the orbit, and to the brain.

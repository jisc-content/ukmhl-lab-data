ANATOMY. 200 form plexuses, from which slender nervous twigs, often consisting of only a single medullated nerve fibre, proceed, which ramify in the connective tissue, separating the indi- vidual muscular fibres from eaeh other. The single nerve fibres in their turn branch, accompanied by a splitting of the axial cylinder, and these branches usually lose the medullated character. The mode of termination of these very delicate branches has been a subject of much dispute. Beale described them as forming a minute network, situated on the extei’ior of the sarcolemma, but in contact with it, and the fibres of this nervous network were distinctly nucleated. Other observers have, however, described peculiar bodies, called motorial end-plates, at the extremity of these nerves. These end-plates consist of a dump of richly nucleated protoplasm, somewhat oval or perhaps irregular in form, into which the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre penetrates. The exact position of these end-plates in relation to the museular fibres is difficult to determine. Krause holds that they lie outside the sarcolemma, but adherent to it; whilst Kiihne, Margo, and Rouget main- tain that the end-plate lies within the sarcolemma, and that • the nerve fibre has to pierce that membrane before it can enter the end-plate. After the axial cylinder has entered the end-plate it divides into very minute branches. Two nerve fibres may enter a single end-plate, and a mus- cular fibre may have more than one end-plate connected with it. ' In the non-striped muscles the nerves are distributed in the connective tissue which separates the fasciculi from each other. Here they form plexuses, which, in the coats of the arteries, in the myenteric plexus of Auerbach in the muscular coat of the intestines, in the muscular coat of

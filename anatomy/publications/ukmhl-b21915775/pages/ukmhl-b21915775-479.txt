EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. â€¢463 Tlie External Carotid artery is the more superficial of the two terminal branches of the common carotid: it begins opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and ascends to opposite the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw, where it divides into two terminal branches, the temporal and internal maxillary arteries. At its com- mencement it lies in the anterior triangular space of the neck internal to the internal carotid artery, overlapped by the sterno-mastoid, and covered by the skin, platysma, and fascia; but as it ascends it reaches a plane super- ficial to that artery, and is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve and the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo- hyoid muscles. It then enters the substance of the parotid gland, where it is crossed by the facial nerve and external jugular vein. In the upper part of its course it is sepa- rated from the internal carotid artery by the stylo-hyoid ligament, stylo-glossus and pharyngeus muscles, glosso- pharyngeal nerve, and pharyngeal branches of the nervus vagus. The external carotid gives origin to a number of branches, of which the superior thyroid, lingual, facial, and internal maxillary run forwards and inwards; the occi- pital and posterior auricular run backwards and outwards ; and the" ascending pharyngeal and temporal run almost directly upwards. a. Superior Thyroid artery arises from the external carotid close to its origin; it runs downwards and inwards in relation to the superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, and ends in the substance of the thyroid body. From it arise a hyoid branch, which runs inwards below the hyoid bone: a sterno-mastoid branch which runs downwards and

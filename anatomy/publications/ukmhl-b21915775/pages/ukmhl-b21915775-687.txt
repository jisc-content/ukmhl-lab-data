671 (ESOPHAGUS. nerves and blood-vessels passing to the mucous coat ramify in it. Tbe mucous or internal coat lines the interior of the tube, is continuous above with the mucous lining of the pharynx, and below with that of the stomach. When the oesophagus is empty it is thrown into longitudinal folds. Its free surface is covered by a thick layer of stratified squamous epithelium, which terminates abruptly at the cardiac orifice of the stomach in an irregular line. Pro- jecting into the epithelium are multitudes of minute coni- cal papilla;. Opening on the surface of the membrane are the ducts of numerous small racemose glands similar to those in the pharynx (fig. 180). Collections of lymphoid tissue, forming solitary follicles, are also found in the mucous membrane. The deep surface of the mucous membrane consists of a layer of non-striped muscular tissue, the bundles of which run longitudinally; it forms the muscular layer of the mucous coat, or muscularis mucosce. The oesophagus is supplied with blood by the inferior thyroid artery, the oesophageal branches of the thoracic aorta and the ascending branch of the coronary artery of the stomach, The nerves are derived from the pneumo- gastrics, which form plexuses containing nerve cells, not only in the muscular coat, but in the muscularis mucosrc. A network of lymphatic vessels also occurs in both the mucous and sub-mucous coats.

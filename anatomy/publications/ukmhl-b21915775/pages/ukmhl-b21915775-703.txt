687 STOMACH. is named tlie greater curvature; the other is concave, and forms the lesser curvature. The curvatures are so arranged that the greater has its convexity directed downwards and to the left, where it lies in relation to the transverse colon and the splenic flexure of the colon. The lesser curvature has its concavity directed upwards and to the right; for the most part it is to the left side of the spinal column with which it is almost parallel; it lies in relation to the coeliac axis. The oesophagus opens into the stomach at the upper end of the lesser curvature, and the cardiac orifice lies behind and opposite to the sternal fourth of the seventh left costal cartilage. Above this orifice the stomach expands into the fundus, which is situated in the highest part of the left hypochondrium, and occupies therefore the summit of the vault of the left half of the diaphragm. At the lower and right end the two curva- tures lie almost horizontally in the epigastrium and ter- minate at the pylorus, where the stomach becomes continu- ous with the duodenum. The pylorus, or gate of the stomach, is situated in the epigastrium about three fingersâ€™ breadth below the ensiform cartilage, and immediately to the right of the mesial plane. The junction of the stomach with the duodenum is marked by a circular coustriction externally, called the pyloric constriction, and by a valve internally, the pyloric valve. At its pyloric end the stomach presents a small bulging, the lesser cul-de-sac, or antrum pylori. Occasionally another constriction surrounds the stomach between its pyloric and oesophageal portions, so as to give it the appearance of an hour-glass, and imperfectly to separate it into two chambers. The stomach does not, as has often been stated, lie

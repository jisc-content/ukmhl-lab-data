367 THE EAE. birds the cochlea is small and rudimentary in comparison with its development in mammals. The osseous vestibule is an ovoid chamber about ^th inch in diameter. In its outer or tympanic wall is the fenestra ovalis ; in its inner is the fovea hemispherica pierced with small auditory foramina, which transmit from the internal meatus the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve; behind these holes, and separated from them by the crista vestibuli, is the opening of a minute canal, the aqueductus vestibuli ; in the roof is the fovea hemi-elliptica ; its anterior wall opens into the scala vestibuli of the coehlea j on its posterior wall open the five orifices of the three semicircular canals. The Semicircular Canals are named superior, posterior, and external. The superior and posterior are sometimes called the vertical canals, and the external the horizontal canal; but, as Crum Brown has shown, the superior and posterior lie in planes nearly equally inclined to the mesial plane of the head, and the external is in a plane at right angles to the mesial plane. Further, the canals in the two ears have definite relations to each other; for whilst the superior canal in each ear is nearly parallel to the posterior canal in the other, the external canals in both ears lie nearly in the same plane. The canals are bent, forming nearly |ds of a circle, and would have had six openings into the vestibule had not the contiguous ends of the superior and posterior blended together to open by a common orifice. The opposite end of each of these canals and the outer end of the external canal dilate close to the vestibule to twice their usual diameter, and form an ampulla. The osseous vestibule and semicircular canals are lined by a periosteum invested by a tessellated epithe- lium, and contain a little fluid, the perilymph. In this fluid the membranous labyrinth is suspended.

The epithelial investment of the crista is elongated into columnar cells, and intercalated between them are fusiform cells, the auditory cells, each of which, as Schultze and other observers have described, possesses a peripheral and a central process. The â– peripheral process projects beyond the plane of the free surface of the ^endothelium into the endolymph as the auditory hair. A hyaline cuticle covers the epi- thelium and auditory cells, and is pierced by the auditory hairs (Prit- chard). The central process ex- tends into the sub-epithelial tissue, where the nerve plexus belonging to the terminal branches of the audi- tory nerve ramifies, and with which it is probably continuous (fig. 108). These auditory cells are, therefore, the peripheral end-organs of the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve, and their general arrange- ment is not unlike that of the olfac- Fig. 108,-Ending of the Vesti- tory cells of the nose. cenT covedng \T~ The Cochlea is by far the most complex part of the labyrinth. It flbrcs' is about -jth inch long, and shaped like the shell of a common snail; its base lies near the internal meatus, and its apex is directed outwards. The osseous cochlea is a tube wound spirally two and a half times round a central pillar or modiolus. Both the pillar and the tube diminish rapidly in diameter from the base to the apex of the cochlea. The tube is imperfectly divided into two passages 2 A

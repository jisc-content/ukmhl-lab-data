ANATOMY. 312 far back as the vertex, c, Its oculo-nasal branch goes between the heads of the external rectus, lies superficial to the optic nerve, and divides into a nasal nerve to the mucous membrane of the nose, and to the skin of the side of the nose, and an infra-trochlear nerve to the conjunctiva and integument of the eyelids. The oculo-nasal nerve gives off long ciliary nerves directly to the eyeball. Also the long or sensory root of the small Ciliary ganglion, which lies in the cavity of the orbit, external to the optic nerve, and which receives also a motor root from the 3d nerve, and a sympathetic root from the cavernous plexus. This ganglion gives origin to the short ciliary nerves for the ciliary muscle and iris. The 2c? or Superior Maxillary division is the sensory nerve for the middle part of the face. It leaves the skull by the foramen rotundum, passes across the spheno- maxillary fossa, and through the spheno-maxillary fissure, then lies in the canal in the floor of the orbit, from which it emerges on the face through the infra-orbital foramen as the infra-orbited nerve. It gives off—a, a small orbital branch which divides into a temporal branch for a small part of the skin of the temple, and a subcutaneous malse branch for the skin over the check bone : b, posterior and anterior dented branches to the teeth in the upper jaw: c, splieno-pcdatine branches ; d, pedpebred branches to the skin and conjunctiva of the lower eye-lid : e, nasal branches to the skin and mucous membrane of the nose : /, labial branches to the skin and mucous membrane of the upper lip. The spheno-palatine branches arise in the spheno- maxillary fossa and form the sensory root of the Spheno- palatine or Mechel’s ganglion. This ganglion receives a motor root through the great petrosal nerve from the knee-

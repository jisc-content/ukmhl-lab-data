INTRODUCTION. 3 adaptation of parts to particular uses ; and by the physician in considering the alterations or disturbance of the structure and functions of parts in the course of disease. To describe the anatomy of the multitudinous forms of animal life from these different points of view would require, not one, but several voluminous treatises, and would much exceed the compass of this volume, which is intended to be an intro- duction to the Special Anatomy of the Human Body in a state of health; in other words, to be a short treatise on Human Anatomy or Anthropotomy. As forming a department of the general science of Comparative Anatomy, the anatomy of Man is interesting not only to men of science generally, but, from its intimate connection with the several divisions of the art of healing, and with the study of the functions of the human body, possesses the highest importance to the physician, surgeon, and physio- logist. SPECIAL ANATOMY OE THE HUMAN BODY. Man, zoologically speaking, belongs to the Mammalian class of the Vertebrate sub-kingdom, i.e., his young are brought forth alive, and nourished during infancy on milk secreted in mammary or milk-forming glands. In common with all vertebrate organisms, he possesses a spine or vertebral column and a skull, in which are contained the spinal marrow and the brain, and in relation to the ventral surface of the spinal column are situated the several divi- sions of the alimentary canal. But man possesses certain special or distinctive anatomical characters. The most noticeable, as seen on an external inspection of his body, is his erect position, which is associated with his higher intelligence. He is,

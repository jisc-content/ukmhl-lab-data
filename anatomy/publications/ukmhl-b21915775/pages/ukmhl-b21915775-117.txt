JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. 101 into hooks, but the thumb can be thrown across the front of the palm, so that it can be opposed to the several fingers, and objects can therefore be grasped between it and them ; but further, this power of opposing the thumb permits objects to be held in the palm of the hand, which may be hollowed into a cup or made to grasp a sphere. The movements of the joints are indicated on the surface of the palm by tegumentary folds,—an oblique fold for the thumb, and two oblique folds for the metacarpo-phal'angeal joints of the fingers; the joints of the 2d and 3d phalanges are also marked on the surface by folds. £ Joints and Muscles of the Lower Limb. The innominate bones are connected to the spinal column by the sacro-iliac joints, the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and the ilio-lumbar ligament, which passes from the 5th lumbar transverse process to the back of the iliac crest. The Sacro-iliac Joint is between the side of the 1st, 2d and 3d sacral vertebrae and the internal surface of the ilium; each auricular surface is encrusted by a plate of cartilage, and between the two plates is an imperfect synovial cavity; posterior, oblique, and anterior sacro-iliac ligaments connect the bones. The Great Sacro-Sciatic ligament stretches from the ischial tuberosity to the coccyx, sacrum, and pos- tero-inferior iliac spine : the Small Sacro-Sciatic from the ischial spine to the sacrum and coccyx. The inuominate bones are connected together at the pubic symphysis, which is an amphiarthrodial joint. The sacro-iliac joints and pubic symphysis permit only slight movement; that at the former is about an imaginary axis, drawn transversely through the second sacral vertebra, which allows the base of the sacrum to be thrown forward and its apex backward

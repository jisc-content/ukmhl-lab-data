PARIETAL BRANCHES OF THE AORTA. 429 of the spine, and gives a spinal branch to the spinal cord through the inter-vertebral foramen. The proper inter- costal branch runs outwards in the intercostal space close to the lower border of the upper of the two ribs, and gives off a collateral branch which runs parallel' to the upper border of the lower rib; they supply the intercostal muscles, and the lower pairs of intercostals also give branches to the dia- phragm and wall of the ab- domen. The Lumbar arteries arise from the back of the abdo- minal aorta, and are usually four pairs. They run along the sides of the lumbar verte- brae, under cover of the psoas muscle, and divide into a dor- sal branch, which supplies the Fig. 121.â€”Diagram of a pair of In- tercostal arteries. Ao, the aorta transversely divided, giving off at each side an intercostal artery; PB, the posterior or dorsal branch; AB, tire anterior or proper inter- costal branch; IM, a transverse section through the internal mam- mary artery, the anterior inter- costal branch of which anasto- moses with the aortic intercostal. deep muscles of the back of the loins, and an abdominal branch, which runs outwards behind the quadratus lum- borum muscle to supply the wall of the abdomen. From the dorsal branch, a small spinal branch passes through the inter- vertebral foramen into the spinal canal to supply the nerve roots, membranes, and vertebral. The distribution of the lumbar and intercostal arteries exhibits a transversely- segmented arrangement of the vascular system in the walls of the abdomen and thorax, similar to the transversely- segmented arrangement of the bones, muscles, and nerves observed in these localities, especially in the thoracic region.

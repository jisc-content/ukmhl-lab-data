OVARY. 827 uterus, but is quite different in the shape of its cells. In- stead of consisting of squamous cells, it is composed of short columnar cells, which have granular contents, so that the surface of the ovary has a duller appearance than that of the surrounding peritoneum. This columnar epithelium is the remains of the germ epitheli am, covering the ovary in the embryo, from which the ova are derived. The line of demarcation between the columnar epithelial covering of the ovary, and the squamous endothelium of the peritoneum, is marked by a whitish, and often an elevated, line sur- rounding the attached border of the ovary. The stroma of the ovary consists for the most part of connective tissue, in which numerous spindle-shaped con- nective tissue corpuscles are situated. Immediately beneath the surface epithelium the stroma forms the cortical layer, which at one time was described as a tunica albuginea, but is not now regarded as a separate coat. The stroma at and near the hilus has been named the medullary substance, aud is very vascular; both the con- nective tissue and the vessels radiate from the hilus into the cortical layer. The medullary part of the stroma also contains bundles of non-striped muscle, which, as Waldeyer states, lie around the branches of the ovarian artery they do not apparently enter the cortical layer. The Graafian follicles, ovi-sacs, or ovi-capsules, are situated in the cortical layer of the ovary, and vary much in ap- pearance with their stage of development. If a follicle in an advanced stage be examined, it will be seen to possess an external envelope of connective tissue, continuous with the stroma of the ovary, and containing a network of capil- lary blood-vessels. This forms the sac or wall of the

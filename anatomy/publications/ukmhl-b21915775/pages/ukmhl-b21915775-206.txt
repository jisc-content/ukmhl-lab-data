190 ANATOMY. nitrate of silver, polygonal markings, which, as Ranvier showed, are the outlines of a layer of flat endothelial-like cells. The size of a nerve is in relation to the number and size of its fasciculi, and the size of a fasciculus is in relation to the number of its fibres. The fibres and the fasciculi lie parallel to each other iu the same nerve; but as nerves branch at intervals, the more external of the fasciculi diverge from the main stem to form the branches. In the white matter of the brain and spinal cord the nerve fibres are not arranged in such definite fasciculi as in a distributory nerve, and the connective tissue between the fibres is the soft, delicate form called neuroglia. A medullated nerve fibre is an elongated cylinder, which, when examined in the body of a living animal, or imme- diately after removal from the living body, consists apparently of a soft, homogeneous, or glassy-looking substance enclosed within a limiting membrane. When examined after death, or after the addition of reagents, such as water, spirit, ether, collodion, acetic acid, &c., it loses its homogeneous aspect, and the following structures can readily be distinguished in it (fig. 63): A, an elastic, transparent, investing membrane,—the 'primitive membrane, or neurilemma; c, a delicate thread, extending along the axis of the fibre,—the axial cylinder or central band of Remak; B, a substance which lies between the primitive membrane and the axial cylinder,—the white substance of Schwann, or the medullary sheath. Within the external outline of the fibre, formed by the investing membrane, is a second line, not quite parallel to the first, and the presence of these two lines gives to the fibre a characteristic double-contoured appearance. The primitive membrane, or neurilemma, not unlike the sarcolemma, is a pellucid, W . vj

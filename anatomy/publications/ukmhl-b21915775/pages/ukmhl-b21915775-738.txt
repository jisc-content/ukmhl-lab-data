ANATOMY. 722 occasions the peristaltic movements, and its increased thickness in the rectum is for the purpose of expelling the fieces. The mbmucous coat has similar relations and structure to the corresponding coat in the small intestine. The mucous, or internal coat, is not thrown into valvule- conniventes, but presents a series of well-marked per- manent ridges, lying transversely or somewhat obliquely to the long axis of the gut, and corresponding internally to the constrictions, which, on the outer surface of the colon, separate the sacculi from each other (fig. 195). These ridges are also found in the rectum, though in diminished numbers. Of the rectal folds, three have been especially described by Houston—one, the lowest, is about 1 ’ inch from the anus; another, the highest, is near the sacral promontory, whilst the third is somewhere intermediate. The transverse folds are formed not only of the mucous and submucous coats, but of the circular layer of the muscular coat. Near the anal orifice the mucous coat is folded longitudinally, and forms the columnoe rcdi of Morgagni. The mucous membrane of the large intestine is covered by a layer of columnar epithelium. It is devoid of villi, and consists of a glandular and a muscular layer. The secreting glands of the glandular layer have the form and structure of the Lieberkuhnian glands of the small intestine (fig. 189, 191); they open on the free surface of the mucous coat, and, owing to the absence of villi, their mouths are more closely set together than is the case with the corresponding glands in the small intestine; the tubu- lar glands arc separated by a rctiform tissue containine lymphoid corpuscles. Solitary glands, similar to those

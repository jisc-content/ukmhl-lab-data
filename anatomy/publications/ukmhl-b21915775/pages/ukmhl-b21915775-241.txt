SPINAL COED. 22o nectecl with the cells of the anterior cornu. The crossed pyramidal tract in the lateral column runs in the posterior- half of that column and can be traced as low as the lum- bar enlargement ; its fibres emerge from the grey matter between the anterior and posterior cornua. The Direct Cerebellar tract lies in the lateral column, immediately subjacent to the pia mater, and outside the pyramidal tract, being bounded behind by the posterior nerve root: it may sometimes be traced down to the lumbar enlargement, and it ascends through the restiform body to the cerebellum, increasing in sectional area from below upwards ; its fibres probably arise from Clarke’s vesicular group of nerve cells. The Limiting layer of the lateral column lies between the pyramidal tract and the grey matter. The connections of its fibres are not known, but it is probably continuous above with the formatio reticularis in the substance of the medulla oblongata. The Mixed zone of the lateral column lies immediately behind the anterior nerve roots, with which some of its fibres are continuous, whilst others enter the anterior cornu and anterior commissure. It reaches the medulla oblongata, and forms there the formatio reticularis behind and external to the olivary body. The Basis bundle of the anterior ^column lies between the pyramidal tract and anterior cornu; its fibres are apparently continuous with the anterior nerve i-oots and anterior commissure, and enter the anterior cornu. It is continuous above with the posterior longitudinal fasciculus of the medulla oblon- gata (pp. 251, 295). The Postero-median or Coil's band in the posterior column receives fibres from the posterior cornu, and from Clarke’s vesicular group of nerve cells ; its fibres ascend to the posterior pyramid in the medulla oblongata. The Funiculus cuneatus or postero-external p

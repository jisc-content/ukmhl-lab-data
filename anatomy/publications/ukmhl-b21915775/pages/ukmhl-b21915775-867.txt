MAMM/E. 851 clitoridis and form the body of the clitoris. The anterior end of the clitoris forms a small and imperforate glans, which is invested on its superior surface by a preputial fold of the integument. The clitoris resembles in structure the penis. Each crus clitoridis is covered by an erector clitoridis muscle, that arises from the ischial tuber, and is inserted into the corpus cavernosum. The clitoris, nymphse, vestibule, and the orifices of the urethra and vagina are enclosed between two folds of the integument named Labia majora, or labia pudendi, which unite in front and behind at the anterior and posterior commissures. Immediately in front of the posterior com- missure is a transverse muco-tegumentary fold named the fourchette. In front of the labia, the skin is elevated in front of the pubes into an eminence, the mons Veneris. The mons and the outer sui'face of the labia are covered with hairs. THE MAMMARY GLANDS. The Mammary Glands are accessory structures to the Reproductive system, and, at the termination of utero- gestation, are engaged in the secretion of milk for the nutrition of the infant. They are two in number, and are situated one in each pectoral region. They form the rounded eminences named the breasts, and occupy in woman, when gravid or nursing, the region from the 3rd to the 6th ribs, and from the side of the sternum to the axilla. From about the centre of each breast the nipple projects, the base of which is surrounded by a pigment- stained ring or areola. The superficial surface of the gland

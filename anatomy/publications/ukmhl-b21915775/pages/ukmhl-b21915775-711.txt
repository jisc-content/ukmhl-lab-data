STOMACH. 695 The gastric glands are separated from each other by slender prolongations of the muscularis mucosae, and by the vascular iuterglandular connective tissue, which is soft, delicate, and contains a small proportion of lymphoid corpuscles diffused in it. In some localities the lym- phoid tissue may be collected into solitary follicles, form- ing the lenticular glands of the stomach. Beneath the glands is a well defined muscularis mucosae, arranged in two layers, which gives off bundles that pass between the gastric glands. The gastric mucous membrane is highly vascular : small arteries enter it from the submucous coat, and terminate in a capillary plexus, situated in the interglandular con- nective tissue surrounding the gastric glands ; a vascular capillary ring surrounds the orifice of each gland. The 'pyloric valve is the name given to the circular fold, situated at the junction of the stomach and duodenum, which surrounds the pyloric orifice. This fold is covered on its free surface by mucous membrane, which encloses the submucous coat and the circular layer of the muscular coat, but not the longitudinal layer, or the serous coat. That portion of the mucous membrane which covers the gastric surface of the valve possesses the structure of the mucous membrane of the stomach ; whilst that which covers the duodenal surface is studded with villi, and possesses the structure of the intestinal mucous mem- brane. The arteries of the stomach are the coronary branch of the coeliac axis, and branches of the hepatic and splenic arteries. They form, as already described (p. 427), arterial arches along the greater and lesser curvatures, and

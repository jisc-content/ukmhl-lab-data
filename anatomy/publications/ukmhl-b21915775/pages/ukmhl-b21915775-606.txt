ANATOMY. 590 Its upper border slopes from behind downwards and for- wards, and possesses a pair of articular facets pos- teriorly for the two ary- tenoid cartilages ; whilst in front of these facets it gives attachment to the crico-thyroid membrane and lateral crico-arytenoid muscle. The cricoid cartilage is connected to the thyroid by a pair of crico-thyroid joints and the crico-thyroid membrane. The crico- is a fibro-elastic structure at- the inte™r °f the thyroid membrane left half of the Larynx, after the re- •' rnoval of the mucous membrane.

The crico thyroid joint is formed on each side between the inferior cornu of

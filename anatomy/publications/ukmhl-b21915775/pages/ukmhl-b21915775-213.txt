NERVOUS TISSUE. 197 In other localities, as in the sympathetic ganglia of man and many other vertebrates, and in the several divisions of the cerebro-spinal nervous axis, the nerve cells have more than two poles or pro- cesses projecting from them. Cells of this kind are called multipolar, and in many localities they present characteristic forms.

In the grey matter on the surface of the convolutions of the cerebrum they are pyramidal in shape ; the apex is directed to the surface of the convolution, the base towards the white matter (fig. 92); the pro- cesses arise from the base, apex, and sides of the pyramid. In the grey matter on the surface of the cerebellum the body of the cell is almost glo- bular ; from that aspect of the cell which is di- rected towards the white matter a slender central process arises; from the opposite or peripheral aspect of the cell two strong, antler-like branch- ing processes extend for a considerable distance (fig. 82). In the human sympathetic ganglia, again, the stellate form

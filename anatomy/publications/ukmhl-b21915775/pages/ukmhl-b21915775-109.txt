JOINTS AND MUSCLESâ€”UPPER LIMB. 93 head. The muscles which act on the sterno-clavicular and acromio-clapicular joints are inserted into the bones of the shoulder girdle ; the trapezius into the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula; the rhomboids, levator anguli scapulae, and serratus magnus into the vertebral border of the scapula ; th% pectoralis minor into the coracoid process : and the subclavius into the clavicle. Elevation of the entire shoulder, as in shrugging the shoulders, is due to the action of the upper fibres of the trapezius, the levator scapulae and rhomboids; depression partly to the weight of the limb, and partly to the action of the subclavius, the lower fibres of trapezius, and pectoralis minor ; movement forward to the serratus magnus and pectoralis minor; and backward to the trapezius and rhomboid. In rotation of the scapula on the clavicle, the inferior angle of the scapula is drawn forward by the serratus and lower fibres of trapezius, and backward by the levator scapulae, rhomboid, and pectoralis minor. The Shoulder Joint is a ball-and-socket joint, the ball being the head of the humerus, the socket the glenoid fossa of the scapula deepened by the glenoid ligament. A large capsular ligament, strengthened by the coraco-humeral band, encloses the joint. It is pierced by the long tendon of the biceps muscle, and lined by a synovial membrane, and is so loose as to permit a range of movement greater than takes place in any other joint in the body. The muscles which move the upper arm at this joint are inserted into the humerus; the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and teres minor into the great tuberosity ; the subscapularis into the small tuberosity; the latissimus dorsi into the bottom, and the teres major into the posterior border of the bicipital groove ; the pectoralis major into its anterior border; the coraco-

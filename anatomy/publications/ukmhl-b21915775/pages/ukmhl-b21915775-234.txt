ANATOMY. 218 on the upper surface of the brain, and project into the lumen of the superior longitudinal sinus. Pia mater.â€”This tender vascular membrane consists of delicate connective tissue closely investing the whole outer surface of the brain and cord. It dips into the fissures between the convolutions, and a wide prolongation, named velum interpositum and choroid plexuses, passes into the in terior of the brain. With a little care it can be stripped off the brain without causing injury to its substance, although it gives a funnel shaped sheath around the blood-vessels which pass from it into the convolutions. The pia mater which invests the spinal cord, consists of two layers, with the outer of which the sub-arachnoid tissue is continuous. The inner layer (pia intima) is intimately attached to the cord. It sends prolongations into the anterior and posterior fissures of the cord; numerous slender bands pass from its inner surface into the columns of the cord, and it ensheathes the blood-vessels which enter the cord, so that it cannot be stripped off the cord without causing injury to its sub- stance. The pia mater is prolonged on to the roots both of the cranial and spinal nerves, and on to the filum terminale- In the spinal canal a slender fibrous band projects from the pia mater covering the side of the cord, and, pushing the arachnoid membrane in front of it, is attached by about twenty-two pairs of denticulated processes to the inner surface of the dura mater. It is named ligamentum denticulatum, and its teeth-like processes alternate with the successive pairs of spinal nerves. The arteries of the brain and spinal cord ramify and divide into small branches in the pia mater and sub-arachnoid tissue before they penetrate the nervous substance, and the veins conveying the blood from the nerve centres traverse

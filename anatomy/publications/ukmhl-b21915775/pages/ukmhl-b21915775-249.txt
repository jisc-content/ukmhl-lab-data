233 SPINAL NERVES. pyramidales muscles. The lateral cutaneous nerves which arise about midway between the vertebrae and the sternum, and divide into an anterior and a 'posterior branch, supply the skin of the side of the thorax and abdomen; whilst the skin on the front of the trunk is supplied by the anterior cutaneous terminations of the intercostal nerves. The lateral cutaneous branches of the 2d and 3d intercostal nerves, comparatively large in size, assist in the supply of the skin of the inner side of the upper arm, and are called intercosto-himeral nerves. The 1st thoracic, usually called the 1st dorsal nerve, for the most part ascends into the neck, to aid in forming the brachial plexus; only a small branch extends along the intercostal space as the 1st intercostal nerve, and from it no lateral cutaneous branch as a rule arises (fig. 76, 1). The 12th thoracic, usually called the last dorsal nerve, runs along the lower border of the 12th rib and gives off its lateral cutaneous branch to the skin of the buttock. In the regions of the neck, loins, and pelvis, the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves do not pass simply outwards to their distribution. In each region adjacent nerves interlace with each other, and form what is technically called a Nervous Plexus. When a branch arises from a thoracic nerve, it contains fibres derived from that nerve only; but when a branch arises from a plexus, it may contain fibres, not of one only, but of two or more of the nerves which, by their interlacement, form the plexus. Hence the parts which are supplied by these branches are brought into connection with a greater number of nerves, and consequently with a greater extent of the spinal cord or nerve centre, than are the parts which receive branches from a single nerve only. These plexuses are especially

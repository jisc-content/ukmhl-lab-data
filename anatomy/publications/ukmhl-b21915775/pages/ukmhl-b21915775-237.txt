221 SPINAL CORD. columns, anterior, lateral, and posterior, by the lines of emergence of the roots of the spinal nerves. The anterior nerve roots emerge as separate fasciculi at the antero- lateral depression, and between it and the antero- median fissure is the anterior column of the cord. The pos- terior nerve roots emerge from a definite fissure, the postero-lateral fissure, and be- tween it and the postero - median fissure is the pos- terior column ; whilst the lateral column is between the anterior and posterior nerve roots (fig. 73). In the cervical and upper dorsal region the posterior column is subdivided by the postero-intermediate fissure into the small postero-median column or land of Goll, which lies next to the postero- median fissure, and the postero-external column or funiculus cuneatus (posterior root-zone of Charcot), which lies next the posterior nerve root. The division of the cord into columns, cornua and commissures is well seen in trans- verse sections through its substance. The cord is composed of white and grey matter and contains both nerve fibres and nerve cells. The white matter is external, and forms the columns of the cord. Fig. 73.â€”Transverse Section through the Lumbar Cord. AF, antero-median, and PF, postero-median fissures; PC, posterior, LC, lateral, and AC, anterior columns; AR, anterior, and PR, posterior nerve roots; C, central canal of cord, with its columnar epithelial lining. The pia mater is shown investing the cord, sending processes into the anterior and posterior fissures, as well as delicate prolongations into the columns. The crescentic arrangement of the grey matter is shown by the darker shaded portion.

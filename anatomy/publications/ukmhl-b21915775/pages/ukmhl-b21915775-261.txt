THE BRAIN—MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 245 tracts in tlie an tern-lateral columns of the cord; and the lower limit of the medulla is marked by the passage across this fissure of three to five bundles of nerve fibres, from each lateral column of the cord to the oppo- site anterior pyramid ; this crossing is called the decussation of the pyramids (figs. 78, 79). The anterior pyramid is bounded externally by a groove, very distinct above, where it separ- ates the pyramid from the olive, and gives pas- sage to the roots of the 9th cranial nerve ; but faint below where it is in line with the antero- lateral depression for the anterior spinal nerve roots. The Olive is a convex projection, about ^jth3 inch long, placed immediately external to the upper §rds of the anterior pyramid. Ex- ternal to the lower third Flo. 78.—Diagrammatic dissection of the Me- dulla Oblongata and Pons to show the course of the fibres, a, superficial, a', deep trans- verse fibres of the pons; b, b, anterior pyra- mids ascending at b' through the pons ; c, c, olivary bodies; o', olivary fasciculus in the pons; d. d, anterior columns of the cord; e, pyramidal fibres of the right column join- ing the outer side of the anterior pyramid; /, the outer part passing deeper than the olive; g, lateral column of cord; h, the pyramidal fibres which decussate at k, the decussation of the pyramids; l, the direct cerebellar fibres which join the rcstifomr body; in, fibres which form the formatio reticularis; n, arciform fibres. 1 and 2, sensory and motor roots of fifth nerve; 3, sixth nerve; 4, portio dura; 5,portio intermedia; 6, portio mollis of seventh nerve; 7, glosso-pharyngeal; 8, pneumo-gastric; 9, spinal accessory of eighth nerve ; 10, hypoglossal nerve. of this pyramid is the Lateral Trad of the medusa, which is continuous below with the anterior^or mix'ecl zone fibres of the lateral column of the cord. Posterior to the olive is a broad shallow groove, through which the

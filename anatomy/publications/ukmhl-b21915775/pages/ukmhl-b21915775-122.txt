106 ANATOMY. pair of transverse facets. In order to provide a smooth surface for the patella in the extended position, the synovial membrane covers the front of the femur above the trochlea, and this membrane is drawn upwards by the action of the sub-crureus muscle. At the commencement of flexion a slight rotation inwards of the leg and foot takes place through the action of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus, which are inserted close together into the upper end of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, assisted by the popliteus; whilst the extensor and biceps muscles cause, at the completion of extension, a slight rotation outwards of the leg and foot. The movements of flexion and extension are not simply in the antero-posterior plane, but along oblique paths, which are determined by the screwed con- figuration of the femoral condyles. In complete extension of the leg the joint is “ screwed home ”; and as this position is necessary for the preservation of the erect attitude, the anterior crucial and the lateral and posterior ligaments are then all tense, and the joint is fixed. The muscles which rotate the leg and foot inwards initiate the act of flexion by unlocking the joint. In complete flexion of the knee the posterior crucial ligament and the anterior ligament are tense and rotation is more freely permitted. Tibio-ftbular Joints.—The superior has an anterior and a posterior ligament, and the synovial membrane is sometimes continuous with that of the knee : the middle consists of an interosseous membrane between the shafts of the tibia and fibula; the inferior has an anterior and a posterior ligament, a transverse ligament which deepens the ankle joint and a strong interosseous ligament between the apposed surfaces of the two bones. The movement between the bones is very slight.

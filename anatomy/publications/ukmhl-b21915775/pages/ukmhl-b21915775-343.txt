327 THE NOSE. passage, is accessory to the production of the voice, aids in the sense of taste, and forms one of the most important features of the face. It is divided into a right and a left chamber by a vertical mesial partition, the septum nasi, so that the nose is a double organ in the same sense as the eyes or ears are double. The walls of the cavity of the nose are formed partly of bone and partly of cartilage. The osseous walls are referred to on page 35. The cartil- ages form the point, the alse, and a part of the septum nasi. The mesial or septal cartilage is triangular in shape, and fits into the interval between the vomer, the mesial plate of the ethmoid, and the nasal spine of the superior maxilla (fig. 7). Anteriorly and inferiorly its border is free, pro- jects on the face, and forms the columna of the nose. The lateral cartilages form the tip and alse. On each side is an upper lateral cartilage attached by its outer margin to the free edge of the nasal bone and superior maxilla, whilst by its inner it is continuous with the anterior border of the septal cartilage. The lower lateral cartilage curves inwards upon itself, touches its fellow in the mesial plane at the tip, and forms the anterior and lateral boundary of the orifice of the nostril. It is connected by fibrous mem- brane above to the upper lateral cartilage, and behind to the anterior edge of the superior maxilla. In this mem- brane two to five small cartilaginous plates, called the epactal cartilages, are often found imbedded. The skin of the nose, which covers the lower lateral cartilage, contains numerous sebaceous follicles, which open by comparatively large orifices on the surface. It is closely connected to these cartilages, and to the muscles of the aim. The lower lateral cartilage forms the wall of the vestibule or entrance to the nasal chamber, and the vestibule is lined by a pro-

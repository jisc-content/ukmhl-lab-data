.270 ANATOMY. tudinal fissure. Springing from the front of this convolu- tion, and passing forwards to the anterior end of the cerebrum, are the superior, middle, and inferior frontal con- volutions, arranged in parallel tiers from above downwards, and separated from each other by the superior and inferior Â« frontal sidci. The under surface of the frontal lobe rests upon the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and possesses an olfactory fissure, on which the olfactory peduncle rests, and a triradiate fissure, which divides this surface into small irregular convolutions continuous with the inferior and middle frontal convolutions. Between the olfactory sulcus and the longitudinal fissure is the gyrus rectus. The Parietal Lobe is also complex; its most anterior convolution, the ascending parietal, ascends parallel to and immediately behind the fissure of Bolando. Springing from the upper and posterior part of this convolution is the postero-parietal convolution, which bounds the longitudinal fissure and extends as far back as the parieto-occipital fissure. Springing from the lower and posterior part of the ascending parietal convolution is the supra-marginal convolution, which forms a part of the upper boundary of the Sylvian fissure; as it occupies the hollow in the parietal bone, which corresponds to the parietal eminence, it may appropriately be named the convolution of the parietal eminence. Continuous with the convolution of the parietal eminence is the angular convolution, which bends round the posterior end of the Sylvian fissure. Lying in the parietal lobe is the intra-parietal fissure, which separates the convolution of the parietal eminence from the ascending and postero-parietal convolutions. The occipital is con- nected with the parietal lobe by two annectent or bridging gyri, which bridge across the transverse external part of the

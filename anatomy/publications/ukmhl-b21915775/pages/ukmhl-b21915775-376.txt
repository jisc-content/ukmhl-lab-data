360 ANATOMY. orbit contains, as H. Muller and I have described, a layer of non-striped muscular fibre in the part which covers over the spheno-maxillary fissure. In man it is rudimentary, but in the sheep, deer, elephant, &c., where the osseous wall of the orbit is deficient, this muscle forms a well-defined structure. It has been suggested that it acts as a protractor muscle of the globe. The Ear. The Ear, or organ of Hearing, is a complex acoustic apparatus, placed in connection with the temporal bone. It is divided into three parts, named external, middle, and internal ear. External Ear. The External Ear consists of the pinna or auricle and the external auditory meatus. The auricle is the oblong convoluted body situated at the side of the head. Its incurved outer border is named the helix. Within this lies a curved ridge, the anti-helix, in front of which is a deep hollow, the concha, which leads into the external meatus. The concha is bounded in front by a prominence, the tragus, and behind by a smaller prominence, the anti- tragus; below the anti-tragus is the lobule, which forms the most dependent part of the auricle. The framework of the auricle is formed of yellow elastic fibro-cartilage invested by integument, except the lobule, which consists merely of a fold of integument containing fat. Attached to the cartilage are the three auricular muscles referred to on page 85, and smaller rudimentary muscles called the proper muscles of the pinna. Thus the greater muscle of the helix is placed on its anterior border; the lesser muscle of the helix is situated where it arises out of the concha; the muscle of the tragus lies on the front of that prominence; the muscle of the anti-tragus is placed on the back of its

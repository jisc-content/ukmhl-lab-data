108 ANATOMY. longitudinal columns of the tarsus. Dorsal ligaments con- nect the three cuneiforms with each other and with the sciphoid and cuboid, the cuboid with the os calcis, and the scaphoid with the astragalus. Plantar ligaments as a rule pass between contiguous bones ; two between the os calcis and cuboid are very powerful and named long and short plantar ligaments; the exception is the astragalo-scaphoid joint, the plantar bands for which are the strong external and inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligaments, on the latter of which the astragalus rests. Between the several bones of the tarsus gliding is per- mitted, especially between the os calcis and cuboid, the os calcis and astragalus, and the astragalus and scaphoid, so that the foot can be inverted or everted, i.e., its inner or outer borders raised from the ground. Inversion is per- formed by the tibialis anticus and by the tibialis posticus ; the tendon of the tibialis posticus, though inserted chiefly into the tubercle of the scaphoid bone, gives slips to all the tarsal bones except the astragalus; and to all the metatarsal bones except the 1st and 5th. This tendon lies in contact with the- plantar surface of the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, and both it and the tibialis anticus act as slings in preserving the internal arch of the foot. Eversion is performed by the peronei longus and brevis, situated on the outer side of the leg, the tendons of which pass behind the outer malleolus,—the brevis to be inserted into the base of the 5th metatarsal, the longus into the plantar surface of the 1st and 2d metatarsals and ento-cuneiform. Tarso-Metatarsal Joints.—Dorsal and plantar ligaments pass between the corresponding surfaces of contiguous bones. Interosseous ligaments are, one from ento-cunei-

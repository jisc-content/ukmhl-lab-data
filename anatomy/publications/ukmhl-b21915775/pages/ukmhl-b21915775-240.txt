224 ANATOMY. the flattened stellate cells of Deiters. The nerve fibres of the various columns run longitudinally in the cord and lie parallel to each other, so that in transverse sections through the columns the fibres are transversely divided. The individual fibres vary much in diameter, but the axial cylinder and medullary sheath can be seen. Some of the longitudinal fibres run from below upwards and conduct either excito-motory impulses to regions in the spinal cord itself, or sensory impulses to the brain. Other fibres again descend from the brain and higher region of the cord to the lower, and conduct motor and vaso-motor impulses from above downwards. Hence the columns of the cord contain distinct tracts of fibres, which perform different functions, and in the upper regions of the cord these tracts are more precisely differentiated than in the lower. Through the researches, more especially of Flechsig, a more definite knowledge of these tracts has recently been obtained. The Pyra- midal tracts, so named be- cause they are continuous with and form the anterior pyramids of the medulla Transverse oblongata, are found both in the anterior and lateral columns. The direct pyra- midal tract in the anterior column lies next the anterior Fig. 73*.—Diagrammatic Section through the Spinal Cord on the level of the 6th cervical nerve, ac, anterior, and pc. posterior cornu; ar, anterior, andpr, posterior nerve roots; pt, pyramidal tract of anterior, and p', pyramidal tract of lateral column; c, direct cerebellar tract of lateral column; l, limiting layer, and m, mixed zone of lateral column; pm, _ . . , posterior median division of posterior median fissure J it IS best column; fc, funiculus cuneatus or postero-extemal column; 6, basis bundle of anterior column.—Modified from Flechsig. marked in the cervical region, but may at times be traced as far down as the lumbar; its fibres are probably con-

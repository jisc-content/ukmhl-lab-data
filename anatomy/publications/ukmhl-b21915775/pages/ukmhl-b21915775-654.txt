ANATOMY. 438 passages is much, more simple tliau that of the bronchi. It consists of a very thin and delicate fibro-elastic mem- brane, covered on its free surface by a single layer of pave- ment epithelium. The epithelial cells are polygonal scales, in contact by their margins, so that they form a continuous layer, which lines not only the bottom of the air-vesicles, but covers the intermediate septa. The nuclei of these Fio. 175.—A, tlie pulmonic Capillaries in the walls of the air-vessels; B, the tesse- iated epithelium e, lining the air vesicles of the cat's lung; at ct, the elastic fibres in the wall are shown; c, a capillary with its blood corpuscles, the size of which may he compared with that of the epithelium cells. X 450. cells are rounded and granular, so that they are much more easily recognised than the surrounding very translucent protoplasm of the cell substance. This pavement epi- thelium is in the same morphological plane as the ciliated epithelium of the bronchi. The fibro-elastic membranous wall consists of a very delicate connective tissue in which a few corpuscles are imbedded. Its elastic fibres are dis- tinct, and though few in number at the bottom of an air- vesicle, are more numerous in the intermediate septa, and form apparently a ring-like arrangement around the mouth of the air-vesicle where it communicates with the lobular passage. This elastic tissue permits the air-vesicles to

ANATOMY. 66 into a cavity, lined by a smooth synovial membrane, and containing a little fluid. Ligamentous bands, continuous with the periosteum investing the bones, invest the fibro- cartilage, and assist in binding the bones together. The best examples of amphiarthrodial joints are furnished by the articulations between the bodies of the true vertebrae. A diarthrosis admits of more perfect movement. In it the two articular surfaces are each covered by a plate of encrusting cartilage, the free sur- face of which is smooth and polished; between these surfaces is a cavity of only a capillary lumen, containing a viscid fluid, the synovia, for lubricating the smooth surfaces of the cartilage and facilitating the movements of the joint (fig. 16). This cavity is Fig\^‘T7erticai Section through enclosed by ligaments, which are car.il’age^on the articvU^ sur- afctached t0 the boIleS> aDd USUally vesting ligament, ’ the’ “ci inhibit °r check excessive move- the® synovial memhr/meTi^e merit in particular directions ; the letter s is placed in the cavity . c , . of the joint. inner surface of these ligaments is lined by a synovial membrane which secretes the synovia. Sometimes a plate or meniscus of fibro-cartilage is interposed between, without being attached to the encrusting cartilages of a diarthrodial joint, so as more or less perfectly to divide the cavity enclosed by the ligaments into two spaces (fig. 17). The articular surfaces of diarthrodial joints are retained in apposition with each other, sometimes by in- vesting ligaments, at others by surrounding muscles and tendons; at others by atmospheric pressure, aided by the viscidity of the interposed synovia.

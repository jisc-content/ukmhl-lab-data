SPINAL NERVES. 239 formed by the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th lumbar nerves, which form a series of loop-like interlacements in the substance of the psoas muscle and in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae (fig. 77). It gives origin to com- municating, muscular, cutaneous, and mixed branches. Communicating branches join the four upper lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic cord. Muscular branches supply the quadratus lumborum muscle, and the psoas. The Cutaneous branches are—a, 1 lio-hypogastric, from the 1st lumbar nerve, which gives an iliac branch to the skin of the buttock, and a hypogastric branch to the skin of the abdomen above the pubic symphysis ; b, Ilio-inguinal, also from the 1st lumbar, which supplies the skin of the groin, and by some is said to send a branch to the internal oblique muscle; c, External Cutaneous, from the 2d and 3d lumbar, which supplies the skin on the outer aspect of the hip and thigh. The Mixed branches are as follows :—- a, Genito-crural, chiefly from the 2d lumbar, but partly from the 1st, supplies the cremaster muscle, and a cutaneous branch to the skin of the groin, b, Anterior Crural, chiefly from the 3d and 4th lumbar nerves, but partly from the 2d, is a large nerve which enters the thigh by passing behind Poupart’s ligament, and supplies muscular branches to the extensor muscles of the knee-joint, viz., the rectus femoris, crureus, vastus interims and externus, and also to the sartorius, psoas-iliacus and pectin eus, which act as flexors of the hip-joint; it also gives off the following cutaneous branches :—An internal cutaneous to the skin of the inner side of the thigh, a middle cutaneous to the skin of the middle of the front of the thigh, and the long saphenous nerve, which supplies the skin of the inner side of the knee-joint, the inner side of the leg and of the foot.

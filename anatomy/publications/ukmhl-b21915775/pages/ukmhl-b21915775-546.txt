ANATOMY. 530 pliatics, the superficial being situated next the investing coat of the organ, whilst the deep are situated along with the blood-vascular trunks in its substance. Lymphatics differ from veins in possessing in their course glandular enlargements, the lymph glands; in having thinner coats; in being almost uniform in size and much smaller than the veins; in not as a rule uniting into larger vessels as they pass onwards in their course; and in conveying lymph and not blood. They are for the most part fine thread-like tubes, and their main trunk, the thoracic duct, is not bigger than a crowquill. From the number of valves in these vessels, they present, when distended with fluid, a beaded or moniliform appearance. The lymph-vessels are divided into lacteal or chyle vessels and proper lymphatic vessels. Distribution of the Lacteal or Chyle Vessels. The Lacteal or Chyle vessels are limited to the intestine and its mesenteric folds, and are named from the milk-like chyle which they contain. They principally arise in the minute processes called intestinal villi, which project from the free surface of the mucous membrane of the small intestine into the canal of the bowel. The lacteals from adjacent villi unite and form a network in the submucous coat of the intestine, from which larger lacteals arise, which pierce the muscular coat. Imme- diately beneath the serous coat a longitudinal network exists, which communicates with the deeper lacteals. From these networks larger lacteals proceed, which enter the mesentery and ascend between its folds to its root of attachment at the posterior wall of the abdomen, where,

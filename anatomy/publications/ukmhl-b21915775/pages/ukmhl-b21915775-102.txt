86 ANATOMY. the fissure between the eyelids. This muscle is a charac- teristic specimen of the group of sphincter muscles, i.e., muscles which surround orifices, and by their contraction close them. When the upper fibres of the muscle alone contract, the upper eyelid is depressed,—a movement which takes place almost involuntarily and with great frequency during our waking hours, so as to wash the tears over the exposed part of the eyeball and keep it moist. In expressing a “ knowing wink,” the lower fibres alone of the orbicularis contract, and the lower lid is elevated. The elevation of the upper lid, as in opening the eye, is due to the levator palpebrx superioris, which, arising in front of the optic foramen, is inserted into the upper eyelid. The Nostrils can be increased or diminished in size, and the passage of air into the nose promoted or impeded. The size is increased by the levator communis and levator proprius inserted into the ala, or side of the nostril; and during violent exercise or impeded respiration the nostrils are always widely dilated. The levator communis, which also sends a slip down to the upper lip, is the muscle by the contraction of which a sneer is expressed. A partial closure of the nostril can be effected by the depressores alee nasi and septi narium and the compressor ctlse nasi which depress and compress the alse of the nose: in man these muscles are rudimentary as compared with the seal and other aquatic mammals, in which a powerful sphincter muscle closes the nostrils in the act of diving. The Lips are elevated by the levatores communis, labii superioris, and angidi oris; they are depressed by the depressores labii inferioris and angidi oris; they can be protruded or retracted, or the corners of the mouth can be drawn to one side or the other, by the action of the various muscles

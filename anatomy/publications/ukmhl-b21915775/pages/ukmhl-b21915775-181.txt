OSSEOUS TISSUE. 165 the lamellated matrix is seen to exhibit an appearance, which is characteristic of the osseous tissue. Elliptical or irregularly elongated, spaces, called lacuns^ are to be seen in considerable numbers. Those which lie in relation to the Haversian lamellae are concentrically arranged around the Haversian canals, and the lacunae, the lamellae, and the Haversian canal which they surround, are named a Haversian system. From the ends and sides of each lacuna very minute branching canals, termed canaliculi, proceed, which penetrate the lamellae and anastomose with the canalieuli proceeding from adjacent lacunae • the canaliculi belonging to the outermost lacunae of a Haversian system do not as a rule anastomose with those of a contiguous system, but bend back to join canaliculi in the same system ; whilst the canaliculi, springing from the sides of those lacunae which lie nearest to the Haver- sian canal, open on the wall of the canal itself. The lacunae average in _ ° Fig. 52.—'Transverse Section through the corn- length V T ..th inch, and pact tissue of ttle shaft of a long bone.

When examined in a dried bone by transmitted light, the lacunse look like solid, black bodies, and the canaliculi seem to be pro- cesses branching off from them, hence they wrere errone- ously called by the earlier observers bone-corpuscles. But if a little turpentine be added to the section, the fluid displaces the air which the lacunae and canaliculi contain in the dried bone, renders the part more transparent, and

NERVOUS TISSUE. 193 although the medullary sheath is unaffected by it. We further showed that these differences in the mode of action of chromic acid and carmine might advantageously be employed in the demonstration of the structure of nerve fibres. Ranke has subsequently stated that the axial cylinder possesses an acid, and the medullary sheath an alkaline reaction. Medullated nerve fibres vary materially in diameter in different parts of the nervous system. In the brain, for instance, they are sometimes as fine as the xswoth inch> whilst, in the distributory nerves, fibres of x'sVo^1 °f an inch in diameter may be seen ; though it should be stated that, even in the nerves of distribution, fibres of great minuteness are often placed in the same bundle with those of a larger size. Nerve fibres do not branch in their course, but only at their central or peripheral terminations, and much more frequently at the latter than the former. Non-medullcited Nerve Fibres.—These fibres, which are characterised by the absence of a medullary sheath, are chiefly found in the sympathetic nervous system, but the fibres of the olfactory nerve are non-medullated, so also are the peripheral terminations of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and indeed all nerve fibres in the first stage of their development. In Petromyzon it has been stated that all the nerve fibres are distinguished by the absence of a medullary sheath. This form of nerve fibre consists of pale grey, translucent, flattened bands, from the to incli in diameter. They usually appear as if homogeneous or faintly granular; but Schultze showed that, when carefully examined, they present a delicate fibrillated appearance, like that seen in the axial cylinder of a medullated nerve ; hence, like that N

THE EYEBALL. 347 ments of the cones. The purple colour of the retina resides in the outer segments of the rods. The rods and cones are the peripheral end-organs in connection with the fibres of the optic nerve, and their apparent relation to these fibres is as followsâ€”The optic nerve fibres are continuous with the central processes of the ganglion cells of the retina, the peripheral branching processes of which pass into the internal molecular layer, where they may possibly become continuous with the central processes of the inner nuclear layer. The peripheral processes of the inner nuclear layer enter the external molecular layer, but it is difficult to say whether or not they become continuous with the central processes of that layer. There can, however, be no doubt that the peripheral processes of that layer are directly continuous with the rods and cones of the bacillary layer. The entire arrangement is sometimes called the radial nervous fibres of the retina. In addition to the nervous structures just described, the retina contains a delicate supporting connective tissue composed of a reticulum of fine fibrils. It forms the radial supporting fibres of Muller, and penetrates the different nervous layers between the fibres, cells, and so- called granules, and it constitutes the two limitary membranes of the retina. The membrana limitans externa (8) is excessively thin, and appears in vertical sections through the retina as a mere line between the bacillary and external nuclear layers, continuous on the one hand with the radial supporting tissue which lies between the rods and cones, and on the other with the supporting tissue framework of the external nuclear layer (fig. 101), The membrana limitans interna (1) is formed by the expanded anterior end of the fibres of Muller. It covers

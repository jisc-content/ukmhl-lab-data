They ascend into the corpus striatum and form the white matter of the inner capsule. Many bundles enter the nucleus lenticularis and nucleus caudatus and give to them their striated appearance, and a few pass into the optic thalamus. Many of these peduncular fibres, together with fibres arising in the nuclei of the corpus striatum and optic thalamus radiate into the white matter of the hemisphere and form the corona radiata. The fibres of the corona pass forwards and upwards to the convolu- tions of the frontal lobe, upwards to those of the parietal, backwards to the occipital, and as the stria cornea back- wards and downwards to the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The direct continuity of many of the peduncular fibres with those of the corona is therefore broken or interrupted by the interposition of ganglia at the base of the cerebrum, which Meynert has named ganglia of interruption. The locus niger, nucleus lenticularis, and nucleus caudatus are the ganglia developed in connection with the peduncular fibres of the crust. The peduncular fibres and those of the corona constitute the cerebral portion of the projection system of fibres of Meynert, a term devised to express that they conduct upwards to the grey cortex of the hemispheres sensory impulses derived from the external world, the image of which is projected upon the cortex. But it must also be kept in mind, that many if not the majority, of the fibres of this system conduct motor impulses downwards to be propagated along the motor cranial and spinal nerves. The motor tract arises apparently in the giant pyramidal cells

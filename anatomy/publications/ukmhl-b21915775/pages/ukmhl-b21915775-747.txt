LIVER. 731 to be separated from it with difficulty; but along the lines of reflection of the ligaments from the liver, at the trans- verse fissure, and at the foss© for the gall bladder and inferior cava, it can be readily recognised as a definite fibrous membrane. When carefully raised from the liver delicate processes of areolar tissue may be seen to pass from its deep surface into the substance of the organ. At the transverse fissure it is prolonged into the liver as a very distinct sheath, enveloping the portal vein, hepatic artery, hepatic duct, nerves, and lymphatics. This sheath is named the capsule of Glisson, and is prolonged throughout the substance of the organ, along the ramifications of the portal vein, and the structures that accompany it. Lobules of the Liver.—To the naked eye the substance of the liver does not pre- sent a homogeneous aspect, but is mottled, and mapped out into multitudes of small areas or lobules,—the hepatic lobules or leaflets. The lobules of the liver are irregular polygons, and vary in size from Affth to -^th of an inch. In man and the mammalia gene- rally, the lobules are im. perfectly separated from each other by the inter- lobular vessels and duct, vein‘ x 10' and a scarcely appreciable quantity of areolar connective tissue. In the pig, as is well known, each lobule is circum-

ANATOMY. 768 teeth it has been pointed out that the number of teeth in the permanent set exceeds that of the temporary set. The permanent incisors and canines come into the place of the temporary incisors and canines; the permanent bicuspids succeed the temporary molars, but the permanent molars have no milk predecessors, and are superadded at the back of the dental series. The development of the successional permanent teeth, which are the ten anterior teeth in each jaw, will first be examined. Prior to the period when the lips of the primi- tive dental groove meet, to produce the saccular stage of dentition of the several temporary teeth, an indentation, or furrow, takes place in the connective tissue adjoining the string of epithelial cells, forming the neck of the enamel organ. This furrow constitutes what Goodsir termed the cavity of reserve, and it is filled up by epithelial cells con- tinuous with the epithelium of the neck of the enamel organ. As a cavity of reserve is formed immediately behind, i.e., on the.lingual side of, each milk tooth, they are ten in number in each jaw, and, except that for the anterior molar, are formed successively from before back- wards. The cavities of reserve are concerned in the production of the permanent successional teeth, and each temporary tooth is replaced by the permanent tooth formed in con- nection with the cavity of reserve situated immediately behind it (fig. 213). The cavities of reserve become elon- gated, and widened, and pass above the temporary teeth in the upper jaw, and below those in the lower jaw. At the bottom of each a dental papilla forms, the aj)ex of which indentates and becomes covered by the epithelium

363 THE EAR. next the tympanic passage in the cochlea. The floor of the tympanum is a narrow chink between the inner and outer walls; and the roof is formed by the antero-superior surface of the petrous-temporal bone. At its anterior wall the tympanum opens into the Eustachian tube, a canal which communicates with the nasal compartment of the pharynx immediately behind the inferior turbinal. The wall of the tympanic end of this tube is formed of bone, that of the pharyngeal end of a curved plate of hyaline cartilage, which is connected to the bone by fibro-cartilage ; its pharyngeal orifice is dilated into a trumpet-shaped mouth; through this tube the ciliated mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx is prolonged into the tympanum. The cartilaginous wall of the tube does not completely surround it, but is completed by a fibrous membrane, and a layer of voluntary muscle, named by lliidinger the dilatator trcbse. Above the tympanic end of the Eustachian tube, and separated from it by the processus cochleariformis, is a fine canal, through which the tensor tympani muscle enters the tympanum. At its posterior wall the tympanum communicates with the air-sinuses in the mastoid temporal; here also is found a small hollow eminence, the pyramid, through a hole at the apex of which the tendon of the stapedius muscle passes; and a foramen which transmits the chorda tympani nerve from the aqueduct of Fallopius. The tympanum communicates in the macerated hone with the ex- ternal meatus, the vestibule, cochlea, mastoid cells, and Eustachian tube, but as the first three are closed in by membrane, the only communications left in the living head are with the mastoid cells and Eustachian tube. The tympanic cavity contains three small bones, named malleus, incus, and stapes, which form an irregular chain across the cavity from the outer to the inner wall.

ANATOMY. 264 cover of the pulvinar of the optic thalamus and gives rise to a portion of the optic tract. Behind the testes the 4th cranial nerves emerge. The Aqueduct of Sylvius, or passage from the 3d to the 4th ventricle, lies longitudinally and mesially in the sub- stance of the corpora quadrigemina and is lined by a columnar ciliated epithelium continuous with that of the ventricles. The corpora quadrigemina have on the free upper surface a thin layer of white matter, which is continuous with the Fig. 84.â€”Vertical Transverse Section through the Corpora Quadrigemina. A Aqueduct of Sylvius ; p, peripheral m.ass of grey matter; c, central layer of grey matter ; z, large nerve cells arranged as a zone around the circumference of the central layer; C, C, superior peduncle of cerebellum transversely divided. At tiie right lower corner two cells of the zonular region are represented, highly magnified. fibres of the posterior brachium. Surrounding the aqueduct of Sylvius is the grey matter of the wall of the axial canal, named the Sylvian or central layer, which is continuous with the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle and of the cord. It contains numerous small multipolar nerve cells, and the roots of the 3rd and 4th nerves arise from groups of cells situated near the deeper aspect of the aqueduct. A

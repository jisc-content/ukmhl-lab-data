But the transverse strife are not the only markings seen in a voluntary muscular fibre. Longitudinal lines, not so definite either in extent or arrangement as the transverse bands, passjparallel to its long axis; they are irregular in position, and do not corre- Fig. GO.—A muscu- lar fibre clearing spond to the whole length of the fibre, or transversely into _ discs- necessarily pass through its whole thickness. The longitudinal marks in the fibre are best seen by digesting a piece of muscle in strong spirit of wine, or in a solution of chromic acid. If a fibre so treated be teased out with needles, and the thin covering glass be smartly tapped, the fibre will split up longitudinally into multitudes of minute, elongated threads—the muscular-fibre fib- rillce. A fibrilla may be regarded as equal ling in length the fibre of which it formed a part, and like the fibre is transversely striped; but its breadth is not definite, and depends upon the minuteness with which the fibre has been split up in the longi- Fig. 61.—A muscu- r iar fibre cleaving tudinal direction. The fibrilke lie parallel to fibrin®. to each other, in the long axis of the fibre, and are connected together by intermediate cement. Thin describes the fibrillae as collected into bundles, which are separated from adjacent bundles by spaces lined by flat cells. These spaces he believes to be continuous through holes in the sarcolemma, which admit the nerves, with

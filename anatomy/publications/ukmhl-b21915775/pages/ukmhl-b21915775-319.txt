ENCEPHALIC NERVES. 303 portion, as regards bulk and weight, which the convolutions bear to the corpora striata, optic thalami, and corpora quadrigemina, but data are obtainable of the relative weight of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla to the entire encephalon. Between the ages of 20 and 70 the ratio of weight of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla, to the entire brain, is as 1 to 7'9, or about 13 to 100, and this relative weight is virtually the same in both sexes. From Peacock’s observations the ratio of weight of the cerebellum alone to the entire encephalon is as 1 to 9, or about 11 to 100. Origin, Arrangement, and Distribution of the Encephalic Nerves. Several pairs of Crantal or Encephalic Nerves arise from the under surface ot base of the encephalon, and pass outwards through foramina situated in the floor of the cranial cavity. Continental anatomists usually enumerate twelve pairs of cranial nerves; but because in one locality two of these nerves lie together and pass through the same foramen; and through another foramen three of these nerves emerge together from the skull, British human anatomists have restricted the number to nine pairs. These nerves are numbered from before backwards, in the order in which they are seen at the base of the brain. The names applied to the individual nerves, and their numerical designations, according to both the Continental and British methods, are given in the following table :— Continental. British.

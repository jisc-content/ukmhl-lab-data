EIGHT LYMPHATIC DUCT. 533 then inclines behind the arch and reaches the left side of the oesophagus, at the side of which it ascends to the root of the left side of the neck. In its course in the thorax it receives the deep lymphatics of the left half of the chest, and at the root of the neck on the left side it is joined by the deep and superficial lymphatics of the left upper limb and left side of the head and neck, and opens into the internal jugular or the subclavian vein, or at the angle of junction between them. This duct conveys, therefore, the chyle during digestion, and the lymph contained in the lymph-vessels below the diaphragm and in the lymph- vessels situated to the left side of the mesial plane in the parts of the body above the diaphragm. The thoracic duct contains numbers of valves in its course, and a two- segmented valve occurs at its junction with the jugular vein, which prevents the blood from flowing from the vein into the duct. The Right Lymphatic Duct is much smaller than the thoracic duct. It is situated on the right side of the root of the neck, and is formed by the junction of some of the lymph-vessels of the right half of the thoracic cavity, with those of the right upper limb and right side of the head and neck. It joins the great veins at the angle of union of the right internal jugular with the right subclavian, and a two-segmented valve, which prevents the flow of blood into it, is situated at its orifice. The Lymphatics of the Upper Limb are arranged in a superficial and a deep set. The superficial lymph-vessels- arise in the fingers as digital lymphatics, and from the

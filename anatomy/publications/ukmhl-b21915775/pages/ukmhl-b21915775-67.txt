APPENDICULAR SKELETONâ€”LOWER LIMB. 51 intermediate rough surface, from which a short spine projects, which gives attachments to the inter-articular crucial ligaments and semilunar cartilages of the knee, and lies opposite the inter-condyloid fossa of the femur. The shaft of the bone is three-sided; its inner surface is sub- cutaneous, and forms the shin; its outer and posterior surfaces are for the origin of muscles; the anterior border forms the sharp ridge of the shin, and terminates superiorly in a tubercle for the insertion of the extensor tendon of the leg; the outer border of the bone gives attachment to the inter-osseous membrane of the leg. The lower end of the bone, smaller than the upper, is prolonged into a broad process, internal malleolus, which forms the inner prominence of the ankle : its under surface is smooth for articulation with the astragalus; externally it articulates with the lower end of the fibula; behind it is grooved for the tibialis posticus and the flexors of the toes. The Fibula, or Splint-bone of the leg (fig. 11), is a slender long bone with a shaft and two extremities. The upper end or head articulates with the outer tuberosity of the tibia, and gives insertion to the biceps muscle and external lateral ligament of the knee. The shaft is three- sided, and gives origin to many muscles; along the inner surface is a slender ridge for the attachment of the interos- seous membrane. The lower end has a strong process, external malleolus, projecting downwards to form the outer prominence of the ankle; it has a smooth inner surface for articulation with the astragalus, above which is a rough surface for the attachment of the interosseous ligament between the tibia and fibula ; behind it is grooved for the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. The Foot consists of the Tarsus, the Metatarsus, and the

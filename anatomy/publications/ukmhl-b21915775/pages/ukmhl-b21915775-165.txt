CONNECTIVE TISSUES. 149 and they form a system of microscopic juice spaces and canals into which the plasma of the blood penetrates for the nutrition of the connective tissue. The leucocytes or wandering cells of this tissue also pass along these spaces. It is very probable that these interstices serve as rootlets of origin of the lymphatic vessels. For there can be no doubt, as the injections of Ludwig and Schweigger- Seidel have shown, that tendons and fasciae are well pro- vided with lymph-vessels, arranged as a minute network, consisting in part of polygonal meshes and in part of vessels running longitudinally and parallel to the bundles of connective tissue, and that the walls of these vessels are formed of flattened endothelial-like cells. But the fixed cells of a tendon are not limited to those moulded on the sur- face of its constitu- ent bundles. For the outer surface of the tendon itself is also invested by a layer of flattened en- dothelial-like cells. The wide diffusion of the connective tissue throughout the body and the great importance of Fig. 41.â€”Flat Cells on surface of tendo AchilUs of its cellular elements a Frog- <-From Thin.) have been especially dwelt on by Virchow as sources of origin of the new cell forms which arise in the course of various pathological processes.

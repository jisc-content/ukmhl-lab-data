25 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. From the post-sphenoidal division of the body the great wings, or ali-sphenoids, pass outwards and upwards to the sides of the skull, and each sends backwards and downwards a pointed spinous process. From the presphenoidal division of the body the lesser wings, orbito-sphenoids, pass outwards, and assist in forming the roof of each orbit; each orbito- sphenoid ends internally in a knob-like process called anterior clinoid, and at its root is the optic foramen, which transmits the 2d nerve, or nerve of sight, and the ophthalmic artery, into the orbit. From the great wing on each side, close to its junction with the body, the interned and external pterygoid processes project downwards, and the internal process ends in a slender hook termed the hamular process. The ali-sphenoid is pierced by foramina called rotundum, ovale, and spinosum : the f. rotundum transmits the second and the f. ovale the third division of the 5 th cranial nerve, whilst the f. spinosum transmits the middle meningeal artery to the membranes of the brain; between the orbito- and ali-sphenoids is the sphenoidal fissure which transmits the 3d, 4th, 6th nerves, the first division of the 5th cranial nerve and the ophthalmic vein into the orbit; at the root of the pterygoid processes is the vidian canal, for the trans- mission of a nerve and vessels of the same name. The Ethmoid, or Sieve-like bone (fig. 7), is situated between the two orbital plates of the frontal, in front of the body of the sphenoid and above the vomer, inferior turbinated, palate and superior maxillary bones. It is cuboidal in shape, and is composed of a central portion and two lateral masses, which are connected together by a thin horizontal plate pierced with holes like a sieve, and called cribriform. This cribriform plate forms a part of the floor of the cranial cavity; on it rest the two olfactory

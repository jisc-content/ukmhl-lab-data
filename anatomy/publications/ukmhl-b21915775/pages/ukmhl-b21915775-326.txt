310 ANATOMY. the fibres from the medulla, and leave the cranial cavity through the jugular foramen. This nerve, purely motor in function, is divided into two parts, an internal and an external. The external is derived from the spinal roots, it passes obliquely outwards across the side of the neck, pierces and supplies the sterno-mastoid, forms a plexus of communication with the 3d and 4th cervical nerves, and ends in the trapezius. The internal has its roots in the medulla oblongata, it joins the upper ganglion of the pneumogastric nerve, of which it forms the motor or accessory root, and is distributed along with it. The Hypoglossal or 9th nerve springs out of the groove between the anterior pyramid and olivary body, in series with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. Its roots pass through the medulla to the floor of the fourth ventricle, to arise from the nerve cells in the hypoglossal nucleus, and nucleus cimbiguus, situated close to the median furrow (fig. 80). The nerve passes out of the skull through the anterior condyloid foramen, and arches across the side of the neck to the tongue. It gives offâ€”a, the descenclens noni branch, which, after being joined by the comnmnicantes noni from the 2d and 3d cervical nerves, supplies the omo- hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles: l), the thyro-hyoid branch to the thyro-hyoid muscle : c, the genio- hyoid branch to the genio-hyoid muscle : cl, glossal branches to the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue. It communicates in the neck with the sympathetic, vagus, lingual branch of the 5th and cervical plex-us. The group of Mixed Nerves will now be considered. The Trifacial or 5th is the largest cranial nerve. It springs by two distinct roots out of the side of the pons. The smaller or motor root arises from the nerve cells of a

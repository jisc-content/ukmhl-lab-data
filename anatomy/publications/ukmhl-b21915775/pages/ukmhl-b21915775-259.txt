SPINAL NERVES. 243 ternal saphenous nerve, that passes to the outer side of the foot and little toe. The internal popliteal gives muscular branches to the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris and popliteus, and ends as the posterior tibial nerve. The posterior tibial nerve passes down the back of the leg, supplies muscular branches to the tibialis posticus and long flexors of the toes, gives off a calcanear cutaneous branch to the skin of the heel, and ends by dividing into the internal and external plantar nerves. The internal plantar nerve supplies the skin of the sole and sends digital branches to the skin of the great, 2d, 3d, and tibial side of the 4th toes; it also supplies muscular branches to the abductor hallucis, flexor brevis digitorum, flexor brevis hallucis, and two inner lumbrical muscles. The external plantar nerve supplies digital branches to the skin of the little toe and fibular side of the 4th toe, and muscular branches to all the muscles of the sole of the foot which are not supplied by the internal plantar nerve. The Sacro-Coccygeal Plexus is the smallest plexus of the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves. It is formed by a part of the 4th and the 5 th sacral, and the coccygeal nerves. It lies in front of the 5th sacral and 1st coccygeal vertebra, and gives origin to communicating, visceral, muscular, and cutaneous branches. Communicating branches join the lower sacral and the coccygeal ganglia of the sympathetic cord; Viscercd pass to the pelvic plexus of the sympathetic, and through it to the bladder and rectum ; Muscular to the levator ani, coccygeus, and sphincter ani externus muscles ; Cutaneous to the skin about the anus and tip of the coccyx,

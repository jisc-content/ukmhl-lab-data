The anterior ventricular groove is nearer to the left than to the right border, whilst the posterior ventricular groove is nearer to the right border. The two grooves become continuous with each other immediately to the right of the apex of the heart. In one mammal, viz., the dugong, the ventricular grooves are deepened at the apex into a wide cleft, extend- ing between the two ventricles. To study the chambers of the heart incisions should be made through the walls of the auricles and ventricles, when all these chambers will be seen to be lined by a smooth membrane, the endocardium, which is continuous on the one hand with the lining membrane of the several veins, and on the other with the lining membrane of the arteries, which communicate with the chambers. The Right Auricle occupies the right part of the base of the heart. It consists of a large dilated portion, the sinus venosus, and of a small ear-shaped appendage, the auricula. Its muscular wall is smooth internally, except in the auri- cula and adjacent anterior wall of the sinus venosus, where it is thrown into parallel ridges, like the teeth of a comb, named musculi pectinati. Into the sinus venosus open the great systemic veins or venae cavas. The superior vena cava conveys to the auricle the systemic blood that has been circulating in the body above the diaphragm; it opens by a patent mouth into the upper and back part of the sinus venosus. The inferior vena cava conveys to the auricle the blood that has been circulating in the parts of the body below the diaphragm; it opens into the lower and

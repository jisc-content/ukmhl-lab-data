435 SUBCLAVIAN SYSTEM OF AETEKIES. when it enters the armpit, it becomes the axillary artery ; by that name it extends as far as the posterior fold of the axilla, when it enters the upper arm, takes the name of brachial or humeral artery, and courses as far as the bend of the elbow, where it bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries. The Subclavian artery arises on the right side at the bifurcation of the innominate artery ; but on the left side directly from the arch of the aorta, being the last of the three branches of the transverse part of the arch. The right subclavian arches across the root of the neck, and passing behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle, reaches the outer border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. The left subclavian has to ascend through the upper part of the thorax into the neck, before it arches across the root of the neck. In its course each subclavian artery goes behind the scalenus anticus muscle, so that it is customary to divide this artery into three parts ; a first part internal to the scalenus, a second part behind that muscle, a third part to its outer side. The relations of the first part of the subclavian are not the same on the right and left sides, owing to the differ- ence in origin of the two vessels. The first part of the left subclavian is longer than that of the right; it is over- lapped by the left pleura and lung, and is crossed by the left innominate vein ; it lies in front of the oesophagus and thoracic duct; whilst to its right side are the trachea, left common carotid artery, left vagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The first part of the right subclavian is covered by the platysma, sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, and by the cervical fascia; it is crossed by

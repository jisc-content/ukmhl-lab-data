48 ANATOMY. extremity (tlie upper) completes the acetabulum, whilst the lower forms the large tuberosity, or tuber ischii. The surfaces of the bone are internal or pelvic, posterior, and anterior. The pelvic and posterior surfaces are separated from each other by a sharp border, on which is seen the ischial spine; between the spine and tuberosity is the small sciatic notch for the obturator internus muscle. The pelvic and anterior surfaces are separated by a border, which forms a part of the boundary of the obturator foramen : the border between the posterior and anterior surfaces is feebly marked and grooved for the obturator externus muscle. The tuberosity, a thick, rough, and strong process, gives origin to the hamstring and other muscles: on it the body rests in the sitting posture; an offshoot, or ramus, ascends from it to join the descending ramus of the pubis, and completes both the pubic arch and the margin of the obturator foramen. By the articulation of the two innominate bones with each other in front at the pubic symphysis, and with the sides of the sacrum behind, the osseous walls of the cavity of the Pelvis are formed. This cavity is divided into a false and a true pelvis. The false pelvis lies between the expanded wing-like portions of the two ilia. The true pelvis lies below the two pectineal lines and the base of the sacrum, which bound its upper orifice, and form the brim of the true pelvis, or pelvic inlet; whilst its lower orifice or pelvic outlet is bounded behind by the coccyx, laterally by the ischial tuberosities, and in front by the pubic arch. In the erect attitude the pelvis is so inclined that the plane of the brim forms with the horizontal plane an angle of from 60° to 65°. The axis of the cavity is curved, and is represented by a line drawn perpendicularly to the planes

441 AXILLARY ARTERY. 3d. To scapular region: transversalis colli, supra- scapular arteries. The Axillary artery is the direct continuation of the subclavian ; it commences at the outer border of the first rib and passes through the axilla, in close relation to the outer wall, as far as the lower border of the tendon of the teres major muscle, where it becomes the brachial artery. In this course it lies in relation to the inner aspect of the head and upper part of the shaft of the humerus. It is covered, in addition to the skin and fasciae, by the costo- coracoid membrane, pectoralis major and minor muscles, but where it lies on the teres major it passes from under cover of the greater pectoral. It is in relation behind to the serratus magnus, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles. The axillary vein lies to its inner side, and it is crossed at its upper end by the cephalic vein. The axillary plexus of nerves is at first to its outer side; then the plexus is disposed with one cord to the outer side of the artery, another to the inner side, and a third behind it; whilst lower down the branches arising from these cords are so arranged about the artery that the median and musculo-cutaneous nerves are to its outer side; the ulnar, internal cutaneous and lesser internal cutaneous are to its inner side, and the circumflex, musculo-spiral, and subscapular are behind it. The branches of the axillary artery are as follows :â€” a. Short Thoracic arises above the pectoralis minor, and runs inwards to the upper part of the lateral wall of the chest. h. Thoracic Axis arises close to the upper border of the pectoralis minor, and almost immediately divides into the 2 F

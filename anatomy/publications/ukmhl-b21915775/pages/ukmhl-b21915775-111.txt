JOINTS AND MUSCLESâ€”UPPER LIMB. 95 abduction, or extension, which elevates the arm in the line with the axis of the scapula, is characteristically human, and a distinct articular area is provided on the head of the humerus for this movement. The Elboiv Joint is the articulation between the humerus, radius, and ulna; the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna is adapted to the trochlea of the humerus, and the cup of the radius to the capitellum. The joint is enclosed by a capsular ligament divided into anterior, posterior, internal, and external bands, and lined by a synovial membrane. Flexion and extension are the two movements of the joint, and the range of movement is limited by the locking at the end of flexion of the coronoid process into the coronoid fossa of the humerus, and at the end of extension of the olecranon process into the olecranoid fossa. The elbow joint is a hinge. The muscles which move the fore-arm at the elbow are inserted into the bones of the fore-arm. The flexors are the brcichialis anticus, inserted into the coronoid of the ulna ; the biceps, which forms the fleshy mass on the front of the upper arm, into the tuberosity of the radius ; the supinator longus into the styloid process of the radius. The only extensor is the triceps-anconeus, which forms the fleshy mass on the back of the upper arm, and is inserted into the olecranon. The Radio-ulnar Joints are found between the two bones of the fore-arm. The head of the radius rolls in the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and is enclosed by the annular ligament; the shafts of the two bones are connected together by the interosseous membrane; their lower ends by a triangular fibro-cartilage or meniscus and a capsular ligament lined by a sacciform synovial membrane. The radius rotates about an axis drawn through the centre of

ANATOMY. 34 The lateral regions of the skull are called the temporal fossse, and give origin to the temporal muscles. Under cover of each zygomatic arch is the zygomatic fossa. At the bottom of this is a hollow between the superior maxilla and sphenoid, called spheno-maxillary fossa, from which the pierygo-maxillary fissure extends downwards between the pterygoid plates, palate bone and superior maxilla, and the spheno-maxillary fissure extends upwards into the orbit. Each Orbit is a four-walled pyramidal cavity, with the base directed forward to the face, and the apex backward to the brain cavity. The roof is formed by the orbital plate of the frontal and the orbito-sphenoid; the floor by the orbital plates of the malar, superior maxilla, and palate ; the inner wall by the ascending process of superior maxilla, lachrymal, os planum of ethmoid and the sphenoid ; the outer wall by the ali-sphenoid and malar. At the apex are the foramen opticum and sphenoidal fissure; between the floor and outer wall is the spheno-maxillary fissure ; in the floor is the infra-orbital canal; in the outer wall the malar foramina ; in the inner wall the lachrymal groove and anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina; at the anterior border of the roof is the supra-orbital foramen or notch. The Nostrils open on the front of the face by a large aperture situated between the two superior maxillae, and bounded above by the two nasals. The sides of the opening pass down almost vertically to join the floor, and are not rounded off as in the apeâ€™s skull; from the centre of the floor a sharp process, the nasal spine of the superior maxillae, projects forwards, and forms a characteristic feature of the human skull. Attached to the sides of the opening are the lateral cartilages of the nose, which form the wings of the nostrils, aud so modify the position of

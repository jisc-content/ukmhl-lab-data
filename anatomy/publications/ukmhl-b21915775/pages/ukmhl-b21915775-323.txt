307 ENCEPHALIC NERVES. The Trochlearis or 4th, the smallest cranial nerve, lies at the outer side of the crus cerebri, and winds backwards, round the side of the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, to sink into the valve of Vieussens, where its fibres divide into three roots : one decussates across the valve with a root of the corresponding nerve on the opposite side; an- other passes backwards to the locus cseruleus; the third sinks into the corpora quadrigemina and reaches the group of nerve cells, from which the 3d nerve also arises. The 4th nerve runs forward in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and passes into the orbital surface of the superior oblique muscle. It also communicates with the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic and receives a twig from the 1st division of the 5th. The Abducent or 6th nerve springs opt of the groove between the lower border of the pons and the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata. Its roots sink deeply into the pons, and arise from the nerve cells of the nucleus abducens in the fasciculus teres, which nucleus also gives rise to one of the roots of the portio dura. The 6th nerve runs forward in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus in contact with the internal carotid artery, enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and between the heads of the external rectus, in which muscle it ends. It communi- cates with the carotid plexus of the sympathetic and receives a twig from the 1st division of the 5th. The Portio Dura or motor facial portion of the 7th nerve springs out of the groove between the lower border of the pons and the restiform body. Its roots sink deeply into the pons ; some fibres arise from the nucleus abducens, others from the nucleus facialis, situated deeper in the

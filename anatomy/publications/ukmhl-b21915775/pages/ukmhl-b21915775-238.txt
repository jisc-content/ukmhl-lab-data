222 ANATOMY. The grey matter is surrounded by the white, and has in each lateral half of the cord a crescentic shape. The horns of the crescent are directed towards the points of emerg- ence of the nerve roots and are called the anterior and posterior cornua; the anterior horn is thick and rounded ; the posterior elongated and narrow. In the dorsal region of the cord a lateral offshoot of the grey matter, about mid- way between the anterior and posterior cornua, is some times called the intermediate or lateral cornu ; it blends in the cervical and lumbar regions with the anterior cornu. The proportion of grey matter to the white varies in different parts of the cord. The conus medullaris con- sists mainly of grey matter, with a very thin covering of white. In the lumbar swelling the grey and white matter are almost in equal proportion. In the dorsal region the white substance is five times more than the grey; whilst in the cervical swelling it is twice as much as the grey. The absolute amount of grey matter is greater in the cervical and lumbar enlargements, where the nerves of the limbs arise, than in the intermediate dorsal region. The white matter increases in amount from below upwards, so that its absolute quantity is greatest in the cervical part of the cord. The Grey crescentic portion of the cord contains con- nective tissue, blood-vessels, nerve fibres, and nerve cells. The connective tissue neuroglia consists partly of a delicate fibrillated material and partly of flattened, stellate corpus- cles, the cells of Deiters. The nerve fibres in the grey matter are numerous. They are derived from various sources, from the anterior and posterior nerve roots; from the anterior and posterior commissures ; from the division of processes of the nerve cells, and in addition fibres run

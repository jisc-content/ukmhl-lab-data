377 THE TONGUE. The Tongue. The Tongue, situated on the floor of the cavity of the mouth, is the chief organ provided for the excitation of the special sense of taste, but the under surface of the soft palate is said to participate to some extent in this property. The tongue is also highly endowed with the sense of touch. The structures concerned in the excitation of taste and touch are situated in the mucous membrane which envelopes the tongue. The tongue is also a muscular organ, and plays an important part in articulation, mastication, and deglutition. Its shape is flattened from above down- wards, so that it presents an upper surface or dorsum, and a lower surface. Its posterior part is broad, forms the base or root of the organ, and is attached to the hyoid bone. Its anterior extremity or tip is more or less pointed, and its lateral margins or sides are rounded. The muscles connected with the tongue are arranged in pairs, and form three distinct groups, viz., accessory, extrinsic, and intrinsic muscles. The Accessory muscles are the stylo-hyoid, digastric, mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, omo- hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and thryo-hyoid, already referred to on page 84, which act upon the hyoid bone, and thus indirectly are concerned in the movements of the tongue. The Extrin- sic muscles pass from adjacent parts into the substance of the tongue, and are as follows :—The stylo-glossus arises from the tip of the styloid process and the stylo-maxillary ligament; it runs forwards along the side of the tongue to the tip.—The hyo-glossus is divided into three parts : a, basi-glossus, which arises from the body of the hyoid; b cerato-glosstis, from the great cornu of the hyoid; c, chondro-glossus, from the small cornu of the hyoid. The fibres of the three parts ascend into the side of the tongue.

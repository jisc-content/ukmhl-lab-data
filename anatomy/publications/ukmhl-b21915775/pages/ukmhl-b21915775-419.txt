403 THE HEART. project like nipples or big papillae into the cavity of the ventricle, and are called musculi papillares. Attached to the free apex of each papillary muscle are several fibrous threads, the chordae tendineaz, which, by their opposite extremities, are connected to the segments of a large valve situated around the opening between the right auricle and ventricle. The right auriculo-ventricular opening, situated at the base of the ventricle, is sufficiently large to admit three fingers, and possesses a valve, which consists of three large pointed segments or cusps (hence the name tricuspid given to it), between which three small inter- mediate cusps lie. One of the large cusps is opposite the anterior wall of the ventricle, another opposite the posterior, whilst the third is to the left between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the conus arteriosus. The cusps are flattened triangular folds of the endocardial membrane connected by their bases around the opening; when the valve is not in action the apex of each cusp hangs pendulous in the ventricle: one surface is smooth, and looks to the cavity of the ventricle, the other surface is rough, and is directed to its wall; to this rough surface, to the apex, and to the edges of the cusp, the chorda? tendinese are attached. As the musculi papillares, from which the chorda? tendinese spring, are opposite the inter- vals between the cusps, the chorda? tendinese from any given papillary muscle divide themselves into two groups, one for each of the two cusps between which it is situated. In the mammalian heart, and as Rolleston has shown in the the heart of the bird, a band not unfrequently passes from the base of the anterior papillary muscle to the septal wall of the ventricle. As it prevents over-distension of the

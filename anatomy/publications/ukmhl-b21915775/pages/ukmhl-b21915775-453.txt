437' SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. terior belly of the omo-hyoid, the sterno-mastoid muscle, and the clavicle—and partly under cover of the clavicle and subclavius muscle. It is covered by the skin, platysma, and cervical fascia, and is crossed by the external jugular vein, the nerve to the subclavius, and the descending cuta- neous branches of the cervical plexus. It rests on the scalenus medius and the grooved upper surface of the first rib. The cords of the brachial plexus are above and the subclavian vein below it. From the subclavian artery branches arise in the following order :— a. Vertebral, which arises from the first part of the artery. It enters the foramen at the root of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, ascends through the corresponding foramina in the vertebrae above, lies in a groove on the arch of the atlas, pierces the dura mater, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum, where it joins its fellow to form the basilar artery. It is accompanied by vaso-motoivbranches from the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and by the vertebral vein, and in its ascent through the series of foramina, it lies in front of the cervical nerves. It gives off muscular branches to the deep muscles of the neck : spinal branches, which enter the intervertebral foramina and pass to the spinal cord : a posterior spinal branch, arises on a level with the medulla oblongata, and descends on the back of the cord to anasto- mose with the spinal branches which enter the interverte- bral foramina : an anterior spinal branch arises on the same level, descends in front of the cord, anastomoses with its fellow, and forms the anterior median artery of the cord, which artery anastomoses in its descent with the spinal branches from the vertebral, inferior thyroid, intercostal and

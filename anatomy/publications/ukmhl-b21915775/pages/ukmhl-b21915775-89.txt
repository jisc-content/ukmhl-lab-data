JOINTS AND MUSCLES OF AXIAL SKELETON. 73 skin covering the ball of the little finger; at each side of the neck, also, lies a thin muscle called platysma myoicles, and the muscles which move the skin of the face and scalp belong to the same category. These muscles form the group of subcutaneoios or dermal muscles, which group except in the localities above referred to, is not repre- sented in the human body, but is well known in the bodies of the mammalia generally as the panniculus carnosus. In arranging the muscles for descriptive purposes, either a morpho- logical, or a topographical, or a physiological method may be pursued. â€¢The morphological arrangement is to be preferred when the object is to compare the muscular system in man with that in different animals, and the basis of the arrangement should be into muscles of the axial, of the appendicular, and of the axi-appendicular skeletons, and sub- cutaneous muscles ; a topographical arrangement is most suitable for the purposes of the practical surgeon ; a physiological arrangement, when the object is to study the action of the muscles in connection with the movements of the joints. Joints and Muscles of the Axial Skeleton. The Intervertebral Joints connect the movable vertebrae with each other and the 5th lumbar vertebra with the sacrum. Except the atlas and axis, the other true vertebrae are connected by an amphi-arthrodial joint, a pair of diarthrodial joints, and by special ligaments passing between certain of their processes. The bodies are connected by an amphiarthrodial joint: the fibro-cartilaginous plate or intervertebral disc is tough and fibrous in its peripheral part, but soft and pulpy within (fig. 15). Remains of the chorda dorsalis are said to persist in the soft pulp, and sometimes a distinct cavity, lined by a synovial membrane, is found in the centre of the disc, which in the finner whales is expanded into a large central cavity containing many ounces of synovia.

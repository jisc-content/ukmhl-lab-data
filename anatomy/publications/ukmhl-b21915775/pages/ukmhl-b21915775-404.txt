388 ANATOMY. formed of tire cutis, which also overlaps the side and root of the nail; thus the nail fits into a groove formed of the cutis something after the manner in which a watch-glass fits into its rim. A nail is merely a special modification of the cuticle, the cells of the superficial stratum of which are more horny, harder, and more firmly adherent to each other than in the cuticle proper. Deeper than the horny stratum is the rete Malpighii of the nail, the cells of which are soft, as in the cuticle itself. The cutis forming the bed of the nail is studded with vascular papillae, which are arranged in almost parallel rows. Nails grow both in length and thickness : the increase in thickness is due to the formation of cells on the bed of the nail; the increase in length takes place through the formation of nail cells at the root, and as the nail is thus slowly pushed forward it requires to be cut at intervals. At the root, sides, and below the free border of the nail, the cuticle is continuous with the substance of the nail itself. Hair.â€”Projecting from the surface of the skin are multitudes of elongated cylindrical horny structures, the hairs. In the skin of the scalp, the armpits, and the pubis they are long aud numerous; but in the eye-brows, eye-lashes, vibrissas of the nostrils, and surface of the body generally, they are short. They are stronger aud thicker in the skin of man than of woman, more especially on the cheeks, lips, and chin. Hairs do not grow from the skin of the palms aud soles, the back of the ungual phalanges, and the surface of the upper eye-lids. Each hair is partially imbedded in a depression of the skin, called a hair follicle. The deeper end of the follicle is somewhat dilated, and has in its fundus a papilla, the hair papilla. The wall of the hair follicle is formed of the constituent structures of the skin; the outer part of the wall belongs

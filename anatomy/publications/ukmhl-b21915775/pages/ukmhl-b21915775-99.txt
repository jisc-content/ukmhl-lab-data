MUSCLES OF MASTICATION. 83 depressed, the spine more curved, and the diaphragm rendered more convex. These movements are principally due to the recoil of the elastic tissue of the lungs previously rendered tense by the inflation of the air-cells, to the weight of the thoracic walls, and to the untwisting of the ribs when the inspiratory muscles cease to elevate and rotate them. Muscular action plays but a small part in quiet expiration, though the triangulares sterni depress the ribs; but the expulsion of the air from the lungs may be facili- tated by contracting the abdominal muscles, which, by pressing the abdominal viscera against the under surface of the diaphragm, force that muscle upwards. The Temporo-maxillary Joints are, the tympanic ossicles and hyoid joints being excluded, the only diarthrodial articulations in the head. The condyle of the lower jaw on each side is received into the glenoid fossa of the tem- poral bone; each joint is enclosed by a capsular ligament, which is strengthened externally by a band called external lateral ligament. The name internal lateral ligament is given to a band stretching from the spine of the sphenoid to the border of the dental foramen. Between the articular surfaces is a meniscus, which divides the interior of the joint into two cavities, each lined by a synovial membrane. The lower jaw moves simultaneously at both its articulations during mastication and speech, through the action of the several muscles which are inserted into it. It is elevated by the temporcdes inserted into the coronoid processes; by the masseterics, inserted into the outer surface of the ascending rami and angles, and the interned pterygoids, one into the inner surface of each angle. It is depressed partly by its own weight and partly by the action of the digastrics and genio-hyoids, inserted close to the symphysis ;

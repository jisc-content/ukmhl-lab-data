Depressor anguli oris has a broad origin from the external oblique line of the lower jaw; it ascends to the angle of the mouth, where it blends by a narrow insertion with the other muscles which pass there. From its form it is sometimes called triangularis oris. Levator menti. or levator labii inferioris, arises from the incisor fossa of the lower jaw : its fibres radiate down- wards and forwards to end in the skin of the chin. The muscle of the Cheek is the Buccinator, a flat four- sided muscle, which arises by its upper and lower borders from the outer surface of the upper and lower jaws, a short distance from the alveolar edge, and by its posterior border, from the pterygo-maxillary ligament. From these lines of origin the fibres pass forwards to the anterior border which blends at the angle of the mouth with the other muscles in that region : to some extent the fibres of the upper part of the muscle go into the lower lip, those of the lower part into the upper lip. The pterygo- maxillary ligament is a slender fibrous band which stretches from the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid to the back of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw: as the buccinator arises from it in front and the superior constrictor of the pharynx behind, it forms the bond of union between the muscles of the pharynx and cheek, and ensures the continuity of the walls of these divisions of the alimentary canal. The muscles of the Floor of the Mouth are the pair of Mylo-hyoid muscles, which are situated immediately

46 ANATOMY. crest is of great importance, for it affords attachment to the broad muscles which form the wall of the abdominal cavity. One surface of the ilium is ■posterior or external, and marked by the posterior, H superior, and inferior curved lines which divide it into four areas for the origin of the three gluteal muscles and of the rectus femoris ; another surface is anterior, and hollowed out to give origin to the iliacus muscle; the third or interned surface articulates posteriorly with the sacrum, whilst ante- riorly it forms a part of the wall of the true pelvis. The posterior is separated from the anterior surface by a border which joins the anterior end of the crest, where it forms a process, the anterior superior spine: about the middle of this border is the anterior inferior spine. Between the posterior and internal surfaces is a border on which are found the postero- superior and inferior spines; Fig. 11.—The Appendicular Skeleton of the Left Lower Limb. D, ilium.

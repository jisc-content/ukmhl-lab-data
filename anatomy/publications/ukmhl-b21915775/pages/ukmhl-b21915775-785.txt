The cavity becomes completely closed by the growth of the surrounding connective tissue, and the embryo permanent tooth becomes sacculated. The process of calcification then goes on, in both the enamel organ and dental papilla, in a mauner similar to that already described in the temporary teeth. The permanent teeth then become lodged in sockets in the jaw distinct from those of the temporary teeth. The sac of each permanent tooth remains connected with the fibrous tissue of the gum by a slender fibrous band, or gubernaculum, which passes through a • hole in the jaw immediately behind the corresponding milk tooth. Before the successional permanent tooth erupts, not only should the temporary tooth be shed, but the bony partition be- tween their respective sockets must be absorbed. The superadded permanent teeth, or permanent molars, three in number on each side, lie behind the successional Fto. 21G.—A, the lower jaw of a child between four and five years old. 5, the last milk molar, with the successional bicuspid tooth in the cavity of reserve imme- diately below it; 6 and 7, the first and second permanent molars in their sacs* 6, the cavity in connection with which the wisdom tooth is formed.

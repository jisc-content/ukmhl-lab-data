JOINTS AND MUSCLES—UPPER LIMB. 99 is drawn back to the index by the adductor inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the 1st phalanx ; and the entire thumb is thrown across the surface of the palm by the opponens pollicis, which is inserted into the shaft of its metacarpal bone. The muscles which move the fingers in flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction act on their metacarpo-phalangeal and inter-phalangeal joints. The 3d or ungual phalanges are bent by the flexor profundus, the four tendons of which are inserted into them ; the 2d phalanges are bent by the flexor sublimis, also inserted by four tendons, one into each Fig. 24.—Tendons attached to a Finger, a, the extensor tendon; b, deep flexor ; e, superficial flexor ; d, a lumbricol muscle; e, an interosseous muscle j /, tendinous expansion from the lumbrical and interosseous muscles joining the extensor tendon. phalanx ; these muscles descend from the front of the fore- arm into the palm in front of the wrist, where they are enclosed in a canal along with the flexor-longus pollicis by the anterior annular ligament, and their surfaces are invested by a synovial membrane, which facilitates their movements to and fro beneath that ligament; as they pass downwards in front of the fingers they are enclosed in a strong fibrous sheath lined by a synovial membrane, and the tendon of the superficial flexor is pierced by the deep flexor, so that the latter may reach the 3d phalanx. Four rounded muscles, the lumbricales, arise in the palm from the deep flexor tendons, turn round the radial borders of

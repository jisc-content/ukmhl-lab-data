352 ANATOMY. consists of numerous hexagonal fibres, about -g^^th inch wide, which extend from one surface to the other over the circumference of the lens, so that a fibre which begins at the polar end of a radius on the one surface terminates at the circumferential end of a radius on the opposite. The edges of the fibres are sinuous in man, but denticulated in many animals, especially fishes, so that the fibres, not only in the same, but in superimposed layers, are closely interlocked. The lens fibres are nu- cleated, a structural fact which gives S' t vdkwl « V—T ° a C^ue ^eir true nature, and they are now regarded as peculiarly modified elongated cells.

The Vitreous Body is the most bulky of the refracting media, and occupies the largest part of the space enclosed by the tunics. Anteriorly it is hollowed out to receive the posterior convexity of the lens, but posteriorly it is convex, and the retina is moulded on it. It is as translucent as glass, jelly-like in consistency, and when punctured a watery fluid drains out. Its minute structure is difficult to ascertain, but as it, like the subcutaneous tissue of the embryo, contains rounded, stellate, and flattened cells, it is customary to refer it to the gelatinous form of con- nective tissue; concentric lamellae, and even a radiated arrangement of fibres, have also been described. Most observers regard the vitreous humour as invested by a

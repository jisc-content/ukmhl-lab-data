97 JOINTS AND MUSCLES—UPPER LIMB. radial is longior and brevior inserted into the metacarpal bones of the index and middle fiugers, and the extensor carpi ulnaris into the 5th metacarpal bone ; the flexors and extensors of the fingers have also a secondary action on the wrist joint. The flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris draw the hand to the ulnar side, and the flexor carpi radialis, extensor carpi radialis longior and the extensors of the thumb, draw the hand towards the radial border of the fore-arm. Intercarpal Joints.—The bones are connected' by dorsal ligaments passing between the dorsal surfaces of contiguous bones, by palmar between their palmar surfaces, and by interosseous ligaments between the semi-lunar and cuneiform, semi-lunar and scaphoid, os magnum and unciform, os magnum and trapezoid ; lateral ligaments also attach the scaphoid to the trapezium, and the cuneiform to the unciform. The pisiform is jointed to the cuneiform by a capsular ligament lined by a special synovial membrane. Carpo-metacarpal Joints.—The trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform are connected to the metacarpal bones of the fingers by dorsal and palmar ligaments; interosseous liga- ments pass from the adjacent angles of the os magnum and unciform to the adjacent angles of the 3d and 4th metacarpals. The metacarpal bone of the thumb has a saddle-shaped articulation with the trapezium, invested by a capsular ligament lined by a distinct synovial membrane, so that its range of movement is extensive. Inter-metacarpal Joints.—The metacarpal bones of the fingers are connected by dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments at their proximal ends, and by a transverse ligament (fig. 23) on the palmar aspect of their distal ends. The metacarpal of the thumb is not jointed to the index. G

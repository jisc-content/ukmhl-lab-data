281 THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. the frontal lobe, and the head of the corpus striatum pro- jects into it. The posterior cornu curves backwards, outwards, and inwards into the occipital lobe. On its inner wall are two curved projections ; the lower one, lying next the floor, is the hippocampus minor, or calcar avis, the elevation corresponding to the calcarine fissure ; the upper one, next the roof, is the bulbus cornu posterioris. The descending or inferior cornu curves backwards, outwards, downwards, forwards, and inwards almost to the tip of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe (fig 91). Projecting into this cornu, and following Aits curvature, is the hippocampus major, or cornu Ammonis, which terminates below in a nodular end, the pes hippocampi. This hippocampus is the elevation which corresponds to the fissura hippocampi. A white band, the taenia hippocampi, ox fimbria, continuous above with the posterior pillar of the fornix, forms, the free border of the hippocampus major. The floor of this cornu forms, with that of the posterior cornu, a triangular area, trigonum ventriculi, in which in many brains an elevation exists, the eminentia collaterals, which corres- ponds to the collateral fissure. If the fimbria be drawn on one side the grey matter of the fascia dentata or dentate gyrus is exposed, and between it and the gyrus hippocampi or subiculum is the fissura hippocampi. The uncinate gyrus marks the fusion of the gyrus hippocampi with the dentate gyrus and fimbria. Internal to the fimbria is the vascular choroid plexus, situated in the great transverse fissure of the cerebrum. It lies apparently in the descending cornu, but is actually separated from the cavity by an investing layer of epithelium. The two lateral ventricles communicate with each other and with the 3rd ventricle through the foramen of Monro,

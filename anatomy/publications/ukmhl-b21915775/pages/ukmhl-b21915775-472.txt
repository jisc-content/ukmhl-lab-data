456 ANATOMY. arteries passing along the borders of each digit anastomose on the palmar surface of the ungual phalanx, and the per- forating branches of the deep arch anastomose on the back of the hand with the metacarpal and posterior carpal arteries. Owing to the multiplicity and freedom of the inosculations in the hand, wounds of the arteries are apt to occasion troublesome haemorrhage. If in the development of the arteries of the hand any one of the vessels has not reached its ordinary dimensions, in order to compensate for its reduced size, one or more of the arteries which inoscu- late with it is more largely developed, so as to convey to the part the amount of blood that is required for nutrition ; from this circumstance valuations in the relative size of the arteries are not unfrequently found in the hand. Carotid System of Arteries. This system is composed of the arteries of supply for the neck and head, and consists of the common carotid artery, of its two branches of bifurcation, the internal and external carotids, and of their several branches. The Common Carotid artery varies in its origin on the two sides of the body. On the right side it arises from the arteria innominata opposite the right sterno-clavicular joint; on the left it arises from the transverse part of the arch of the aorta between the arteria innominata and the left subclavian artery, but nearer to the former than to the latter. Both common carotids run up the neck by the sides of the windpipe, and when they reach the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage they divide into the internal and external carotid arteries.

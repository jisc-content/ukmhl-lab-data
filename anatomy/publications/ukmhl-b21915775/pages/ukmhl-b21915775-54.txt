ANATOMY. 38 rib. Its form is plate-like and triangular, with three surfaces, three borders, and three angles. The fundamental form of the scapula, as seen in the mole, is that of a three-sided prismatic rod, and its assumption of the plate or blade-like character in man is in connection with the great development of the muscles which rotate the humerus at the shoulder joint. Its costal or ventral surface is in relation to the ribs, from which it is separated by certain muscles : one, called subscapularis, arises from the surface itself, which is often termed subscapular fossa. The dorsum or back of the scapula is traversed from behind forwards by a prominent spine, which lies in the proper axis of the scapula, and subdivides this aspect of the bone into a surface above the spine, the supra- or pre-spinous fossa, and one below the spine, the infra- or post-spinous fossa. The spine arches forwards, to end Fig. 9.—The Appendicular Skele- . „ , , ton of the Left Upper Limb, in a broad flattened process, the Cl, clavicle; Sc, scapula ; Ac, , acromion process; Cr, coracoid acromion, which has an OVal process of scapula; H, humerus; < xt,radius; u,ulna; c,opposite articular surface for the clavicle) the eight carpal hones ; Me, opposite the five metacarpal both spine and acromion are bones ; P, pollex, or thumb; II.

They are lined by a columnar epithelium, the cells of which at the deeper end of the gland are more cubical in form, and have a clouded granular appear- ance. The other kind of gland is situated in the remain- ing part of the gastric mucous membrane, and consists of tubes which divide usually into four branches; they have been named the peptic glands. The cellular lining of these peptic glands closely corre- sponds with the dimorphous arrangement in the human stomach already referred to. The two forms of cells in the deeper branched part of the gland were first observed by Kolliker in the dog, and have since been specially studied byHeidenhain, Eollett, and Frey. According to the last two observers, the axial layer of cells is absent in a certain extent of the gland tube, below the place where the columnar epithelium Fig. 187.—Vertical section . ,, , v • _ through the Gastric mucous ceases, and the cellular lining membrane of a cat, to show . . - ,» the tubular peptieg lands, c, consists merely of a continuous columnar epithelium near the T 4-1 „ gland mouth; p, peptic cells; layer Of peptic Cells. ill tiie m. interglandular muscular r -ri- band: », vessels surrounding deeper part of the glaua again, tubular gland, mm, muscu- _ TT . laris mucosas; sm, submucous both kinds of Cells OCCUr. iiei- coat. _ . . denhain states that in a fasting dog the glands are shrunken, and the axial cells are transparent, whilst during digestion the peptic glands are swollen out and the cells are clouded and granular.

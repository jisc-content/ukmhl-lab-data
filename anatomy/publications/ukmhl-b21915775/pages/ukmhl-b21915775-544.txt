528 ANATOMY. surface of the valve are elongated transversely. Beneath the endothelium are bundles of connective tissue with elastic fibres, which are most distinct at the attached border of the valve. "Veins have not the elasticity of arteries, and do not pulsate. All veins which have muscular fibres in their coats are contractile. Veins, like arteries, possess vasa vasorum, and vaso-motor nerves are distributed to the muscular tissue in their walls. When a vein is empty or cut across, it does not gape like an artery, but collapses. H. Hoyer has recently pointed out that at the tip of the digits some of the small arterial twigs open directly into venous radicles, the communicating vessels being tortuous like a small glomerulus.

199 NEBTOUS TISSUE. supposed. Schultze has pointed out that the protoplasm substance 'of the body of a multipolar nerve cell, and both the non-branched and branched processes, possess a fibrillated structure similar to that described by him in the axial cylinder of the nerve fibres. Peripheral End-Organs or End Bodies.â€”Nerve fibres at their peripheral extremities terminate in connection with peculiar structures, named end-bodies, terminal bodies, or peripheral end-organs, which are situated in the several organs of the body. The motor nerves end in the volun- tary and involuntary muscles the vaso-motor nerves end in the muscular coat of the blood-vessels; the sensory nerves end in the skin, mucous membranes, and organs of special sense ; and it is probable that secretory nerves terminate in connection with the ultimate cell elements of the secreting glands. The end-organs, connected with the terminations of the nerves in these textures, possess certain structural peculiarities, which are by no means uniform in the different parts,,so that the end-body connected with the peripheral termination of a nerve is distinctive of the organ in which it is situated. It will be a matter of convenience to defer the consideration of the peripheral end-bodies in the skin, organs of special sense, and the several glands, until these organs are described. In this chapter the mode of termination of the motor nerves in the voluntary and involuntary muscles, of the sensory nerves in the mucous membrane, and of the ending of the nerves in the remarkable bodies named Pacinian corpuscles, will alone be examined. After a nerve has entered a voluntary muscle it ramifies in the connective tissue, which lies between the fasciculi, and at the same time divides and subdivides into smaller branches. These branches interlace with each other and

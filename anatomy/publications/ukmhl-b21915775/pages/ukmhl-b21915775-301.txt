235 THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. of small vascular folds, the choroid plexuses of the 3rd ventricle project from the under surface of the velum towards the 3rd ventricle, but are separated from that space by an epithelial layer which represents the thinned dorsal wall of the thalamencephalon. If the velum interpositum be now carefully raised from before back- wards, the optic thalami, 3d ventricle, pineal gland, and corpora quadrigemina are exposed. The Optic Thalamus is the large ganglion developed in each lateral wall of the thalamencephalon. It is a some- what ovoid body, situated behind and to the inner side of the corpus striatum, with which its outer surface is closely united (fig. 92). Its upper surface is partly free in the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle, but is mostly covered by the fornix and velum interpositum; it is formed of white matter, and presents an eminence in front, the tuberculum anterius. Its posterior surface is free and possesses a transverse elevation, the inner end of which forms the pulvinar, the outer the corpus genicidcitum externum. Its inner surface forms the side wall of the 3rd ventricle, and consists of grey matter, which is separated from the white upper surface by the stria meclidlaris. The Third ventricle is the axial canal of the thalamen- cephalon, and occupies the mesial plane between the two optic thalami. Its roof is formed by the epithelium cover- ing the under surface of the velum interpositum and by the velum, whilst above the velum is the body of the fornix; its floor is funnel-shaped and consists from behind forwards of the anterior part of the pons Tarini, the corpora albicantia, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, which is continuous with the pituitary body, and the optic commissure; its anterior boundary, by the lamina cinerea,

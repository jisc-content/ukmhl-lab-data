438 ANATOMY. lumbar arteries, so as to form a long slender artery, situated in front of tlie cord in its entire length, which supplies the cord and the pia mater: meningeal branches to the dura mater : an inferior cerebellar branch to the under surface of the cerebellum. The Basilar artery, formed by the junction of the two vertebrals, extends from the lower to the upper border of the pons Varolii: it gives off collaterally transverse branches to the pons : auditory branches which accompany the portio mollis to the internal ear: inferior cerebellar branches to the under surface of the cerebellum : whilst it breaks up into four terminal branches, viz., two superior cerebellar to the upper surface of the cerebellum, and two posterior cerebral which supply the convolutions on the tentorial aspect of the temporo-sphenoidal lobes, those of the occipital lobes, and the posterior convolutions of the parietal lobes of the cerebrum : perforating branches pass from the posterior cerebral artery to the locus perforatus pos- ticus. The third cranial nerve on each side appears between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries. b. Thyroid Axis, a short branch, which immediately divides into the inferior thyroid, the suprascapular, and the transversalis colli bx-anches. The Inferior Thyroid ascends on the longus colli muscle, and then turns inwards behind the sheath of the carotid vessels and the gangliated cord of the sympathetic to be distributed to the thyroid body; it gives off an ascending cervical branch to the muscles of the neck, which also sends small spinal branches to the spinal cord : a laryngeal brauch which accompanies the inferior laryngeal nerve to the larynx: (esophageal branches to the oesophagus. The Suprascapular runs out- wards behind the sterno-mastoid muscle and the clavicle,

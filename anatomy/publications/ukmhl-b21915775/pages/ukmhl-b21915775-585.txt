THYROID GLAND. 569 The thyroid gland is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries, which freely auastomose with each other in its substance. Occasionally an additional artery, the arteria thyroidea ima, a branch of the innominate artery, ascends to the thyroid gland in front of the trachea. The capillaries, in which the arteries terminate, form a compact polygonal network in the con- nective tissue immediately surrounding the closed vesicles. The veins which proceed from the capillary network form plexuses at the surface of the gland, and give rise to the supe- rior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins. Lymph- vessels arise in the connec- tive tissue between the closed vesicles and by anas- tomosis form larger vessels, which leave the gland at its surface, where they form a dense network. The nerves form a superior and an inferior thyroid plexus, which accompany the corresponding arteries. They arise from the middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, and have nerve cells inter- spersed in their course. Fin. 158.

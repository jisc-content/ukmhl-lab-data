The fossa immediately above the manubrium sterni is the epi- or supra-stemal fossa. The regionâ€™corresponding to the inner half of the clavicle is the clavicular region : that which lies immediately above it is the supra-clavicular region, and that which extends downwards from the clavicle to the lower border of the third rib is the infra-clavicular region. The region which extends from the lower border of the third rib to the lower border of the sixth rib is the mammary region, and that which extends"downwards from the lower border of the sixth rib to the inferior limit of the thoracic wall is the infra-mammary. The clavicular, infra-clavicular, mammary and infra-mammary regions are bounded internally by a line corresponding to the outer border of the sternum, and externally by a line drawn vertically downwards from the middle of the clavicle to the inferior limit of the thoracic wall. In the mammary region are situated the mammary gland and nipple. In women the mamma occupies almost the whole of the mammary region, and the nipple usually lies superficial to the fifth rib, and about 4i inches from the middle line of the sternum. In men the mamma is a rudimentary organ, and the position of the nipple is more variable. Luschka found in 60 men examined, that it was placed 44 times between the fourth and fifth ribs, 6 times on the fifth rib, 8 times on the fourth rib, and twice between the fifth and sixth ribs ; whilst Gruber found it in 95 males, 43 times on the fifth rib, 31 times on the fourth intercostal space, 12 times on the fourth rib, and 9 times on the fifth intercostal

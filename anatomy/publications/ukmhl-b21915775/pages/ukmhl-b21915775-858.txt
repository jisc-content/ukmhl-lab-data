ANATOMY. 842 broad ligament. Sometimes a prolongation of the peri- toneum, named the canal of Nuclc, accompanies the round ligament into the inguinal canal. The muscular coat consists of non-striped muscle inter- mingled with areolar tissue, arranged so compactly as to form the thick, dense wall of the unimpregnated uterus. In the impregnated uterus the muscular wall expands and becomes less compact, during the growth of the organ, and the muscular coat is then seen to be arranged in three sets of fibres. The external set forms a thin layer immediately beneath the peritoneum, the fibres of which extend from the cervix over the body and fundus, and are prolonged into the round ligament, the ovarian ligaments, the wall of the Fallopian tubes, between the layers of the broad liga- ments, the utero-rectal and utero-vesical folds. The middle set of fibres consists of longitudinal and transverse fasciculi, which intersect in various directions, especially at the sides of the uterus, where they surround the arteries and veins of the organ. The inner set of fibres forms the thickest part of the muscular coat. They are arranged in concentric rings around the sides of the fundus, from the place of junction of the Fallopian tubes to the middle of the body. In the cervix and around the external and internal os, they are arranged circularly, and form the sphincter muscles of those regions. The increase in size of the muscular coat during pregnancy is due to the formation of additional fasciculi, and to a considerable increase in size of the muscular fibre-cells. The mucous membrane lining the uterus presents differ- ent appearances in -the cervix and in the body of the organ. In the cervix it is elevated into two longitudinal

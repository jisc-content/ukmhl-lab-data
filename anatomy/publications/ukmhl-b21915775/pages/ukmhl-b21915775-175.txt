159 CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. the plane of the surface, and so closely packed together that the proportion of matrix is much reduced. In the intermediate zone the cells are rounded and lie irregularly in a hyaline matrix. It was from the study of the changes which take place in articular cartilage in disease that Goodsir was enabled to establish the production of new cells by the multiplication of the normal pre-existing cells of the cartilage,—an observation which formed the starting- point of the doctrine of cellular pathology. s '.i Fig. 50.—Vertical Section through an Encrusting Cartilage; s, superficial; m, middle; and d, deep zones of cells; B, the bone on which the cartilage rests. Fibro-cartilages are divided into white and yellow. White fibro-cartilage forms the connecting medium be- tween the articular surfaces of an amphiarthrodial joint, as in the inter-vertebral discs ; or it may form plates in the interior of joints, as in the semi-lunar cartilages of the knee and the menisci in other diarthrodial joints; or it may extend around the margin of the socket of a joint, as in the cotyloid ligament of the hip; or it may invest the surfaces of bones over which tendons have to play, as where the tendons of the peronei muscles play in the groove on the back of the external malleolus. In the intervertebral

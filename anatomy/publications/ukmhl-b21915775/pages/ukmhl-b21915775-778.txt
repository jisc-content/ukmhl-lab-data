In contact with the inner surface of the thin film of dentine, a second layer of odontoblast cells is then arranged, which in its turn calcifies, and as the pro- cess goes on in successive layers of odonto-blasts, the entire thickness of the matrix of the dentine and the den- tinal sheaths are produced. It is owing to this circum- stance that the dentine may exhibit the laminated arrange- ment referred to on p. 753. But the process of calcifica- tion does not apparently take place throughout the whole thickness of the protoplasm of the odonto-blasts, for, as Waldeyer pointed out, the axial part of the cells remains undifferentiated, as the soft dentinal fibrils of the dentine tubes. As these changes are going on in the peripheral layers of the odonto-blasts, the central part of the papilla

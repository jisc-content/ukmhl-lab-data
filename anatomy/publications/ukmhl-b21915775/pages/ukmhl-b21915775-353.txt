337 THE EYEBALL. structureless layer adherent to the back of the proper tissue of the cornea, from which it may be stripped off'without much difficulty. When torn across, the edges curl inwards towards the corneal tissue. It is from -SqQ-0 to -g^^th inch thick, and resists the action of various reagents. This lamina thins off at its circumference and splits into fibres, which become continuous with the pectinate ligament of the iris. The posterior epithelium of the cornea, also called the epithelium of the aqueous humour, forms a single layer of polygonal cells on the back of the posterior elastic lamina. It is continuous with the epithelial covering of the pectinate ligament and of the anterior surface of the iris. The cornea is not in the adult traversed by blood-vessels, though in the foetus a layer of capillaries lies near its anterior surface. In the adult, however, the margin of the cornea is penetrated by a zone of capillary loops derived from the arteries of the conjunctiva; these loops, according to Lightbody, are invested by perivas- cular lymph spaces.

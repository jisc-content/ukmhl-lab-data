TEETH. 749 are long, single, conical, compressed on the sides where they are marked by a shallow groove. In many mammals these teeth are developed into large projecting tusks, The Premolar or Bicuspid Teeth, eight in number, two on each side of the mesial plane of each jaw, lie imme- diately behind the canines, and the upper bicuspids are somewhat larger than the lower. The crown is quad' rilateral in form, and convex both on the inner and outer surfaces. It possesses two cusps, of which the outer or labial is larger and more projecting than the inner, palatal, or lingual cusp. The fangs of the upper bicus- pids are single and laterally compressed; often bifid at the point into an outer and an inner segment; in the lower bicuspids the fangs are rounded, and taper to a single point. The Molar or Mullicuspid Teeth, twelve in number, are placed three on each side of the mesial plane of each jaw. They are the most posterior teeth, are the largest of the series, and as a rule decrease in size from the first to the last; the crowns of the lower molars are somewhat bigger than those of the upper molars. The last molar tooth does not erupt until the end of puberty, and is called dens sapiential or Wisdom Tooth. The crowns are broad, quadrilateral, and convex, both on the inner and outer surfaces. The first and second upper molars have four cusps projecting from the angles of the grinding or masticating surface, and an oblique ridge often connects the large anterior internal cusp with the posterior external cusp; in the upper wisdom teeth, the two inner or palatal cusps are frequently conjoined. The first lower molar has five cusps, the fifth being interposed between the

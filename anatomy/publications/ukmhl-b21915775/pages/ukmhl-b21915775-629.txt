613 THOKAX. space. It varies also in position on the two sides of the same chest. As a rule, it lies in men about 3f inches from the middle line of the sternum. At the lateral wall of the chest are the axillary and infra-axillary regions. The axillary extends from the apex of the axilla to a line corresponding to the lower border of the sixth rib; and the infra-axillary from that line to the edge of the false ribs, where they limit the thoracic wall interiorly. Several regions are placed on the posterior wall of the chest. The scapular region corresponds to the scapula, and in its vertical diameter reaches from the second to the seventh or eighth rib : the infra-scapular region extends from the inferior angle of the scapula to the twelfth rib : the inter-scapular region lies between the vertebral borders of the two scapuke; it varies in its transverse diameter with the position of the arms; for, when they are drawn forwards, the vertebral borders of the two scapulae are further asunder, than when the arms hang pendulous at the sides, or are pushed backwards : the sxcpra-scapular region extends from the upper border of the scapula to a little above the level of the first rib. The size of both the supra-scapular and infra-scapular regions is modified with the elevation or depression of the shoulders. The portion of the anterior wall of the chest which lies superficial to the heart is called the cardiac region. It comprises the whole of the lower sternal region and por- tions of the right and left mammary regions. Owing to the greater portion of the heart being situated to the left than to the right of the mesial plane of the thoracic cavity, it projects more into the left than into the right mammary

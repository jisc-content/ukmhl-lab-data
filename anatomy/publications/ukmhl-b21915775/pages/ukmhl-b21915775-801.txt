785 KIDNEY. named the medullary rays, or the pyramids of Ferrein. In the cortex the tubes extend towards the surface of the kidney preserving their straight course, when they again branch, and the branches, which are at first dilated and tortuous, are named the intermediary or junc- tional tubes. Each intermediary tube then diminishes in calibre, and descends for a vari- able distance into the medullary pyramid, where it turns on itself, forms a loop, known as the looped tube of Henle, and re- enters the cortex as the ascending limb of the looped tube. In the cortex the ascend- ing tube becomes con- tinuous with a dilated and very tortuous tube, which opens, as was clearly shown by Bowman, into a dilated and closed sac, named Boivman’s capsule. The junction of this capsule with the tortuous tube is marked by a constricted neclc, and the tortuous tube is called the con- voluted tube.

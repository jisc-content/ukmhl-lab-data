ANATOMY. 192 sheath, and not unfrequently, as in fig. 63, 2, projects for some distance beyond the broken end of a fibre. Max Schultze showed that it is not homogeneous, but exhibits a very delicate longitudinal fibrillation, and at the ends of the nerves these primitive fibrillee may separate from each other. Although from its great delicacy the axial cylinder cannot be seen in the living fibre of a cerebro-spinal nerve, yet there are many reasons for regarding it as a structure existing in the living nerve, and not the product of a post mortem change. It is the part of a fibre which first appears in the course of developmentâ€”the medullary sheath and primitive membrane being secondary investing structures, superadded as development proceeds. It forms not unfre- quently the only constituent of a nerve fibre at its central and peripheral terminations, and is therefore the part of the fibre which is anatomically continuous with the nerve cell, or with the peripheral end-organ. As it is the sole constituent of many nerve fibres at their terminations, and of all nerve fibres in the earlier stage of development, and as it forms the medium of connection between them and the structures in which they terminate, it is obviously of primary importance both anatomically and physiologically, and is believed to be the part of the fibre directly concerned in the conduction of nervous impulses ; whilst the investing structures serve the purpose of insulating materials. Lister and I pointed out, in 1859, that essential differences in chemical composition existed between the axial cylinder and the medullary sheath ; the former being unaffected by chromic acid, though the latter is rendered opaque and brown, and concentrically striated under its influence; while, on the other hand, the axial cylinder is stained red with great facility by an ammoniacal solution of carmine,

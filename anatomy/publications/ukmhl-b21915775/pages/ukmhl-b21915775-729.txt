713 large intestine. dilated part of the large intestine, and forms a large cul-de- sac, closed in below, but communicating freely above with the ascending colon. Opening on the inner and posterior wall of the coecum is the Appendix vermifor mis, which is a slender hollow prolongation of the bowel, varying in length from three to six inches. It has the calibre of the stem of a common tobacco pipe, and ends in a free closed extremity, so that, like the coecum, it is a cul-de-sac. It possesses a peritoneal fold or small mesentery, by which it is sometimes tied to the adjacent wall of the abdomen, though at other times it may be freely movable. It is not generally found in mammals, but is present in man, the orang, certain lemurs, and the marsupial wombat. The Ascending or Right Colon is continuous below with the ccecum and above with the hepatic flexure. It occupies the right lumbar region, and is attached by areolar tissue to the fascia covering the quadratus lumborum muscle and to the front of the right kidney. The Hepatic Flexure of the Colon is a bend in the large intestine, forming almost a right angle, continuous on the one hand with the ascending colon, and on the other with the transverse colon. It lies in the right hypochondriac region in contact with the under surface of the liver. The Transverse Colon connects the hepatic and splenic flexures, and curves across the abdomen from the right hypochondrium, through the umbilical region to the left hypochondrium. It forms the arch of the colon, the convexity of which is directed downwards and forwards, and the concavity upwards and backwards. It lies imme- diately below the great curvature of the stomach, and is 2 z

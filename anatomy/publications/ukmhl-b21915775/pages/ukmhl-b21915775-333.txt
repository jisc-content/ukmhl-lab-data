ENCEPHALIC NERVES. 317 which traverses a small canal in the petrous temporal, and emerging through a hole behind the external meatus ends in the skin of the back of the auricle. The lower ganglion is high in the neck : it communicates with the sympathetic and hypoglossal, and gives origin to—a, two 'pharyngeal branches which form with the glosso-pharyngeal and sympathetic nerves the pharyngeal plexus, which supplies the muscles of the pharynx : b, the superior laryngeal, which divides into an external branch to supply the crico- thyroid muscle, and an internal, which pierces the thyro- hyoid membrane, supplies the mucous lining of the larynx and the mucous covering of the epiglottis and root of the tongue. From the nerve trunk arise—a, the recurrent laryngeal, which on the right side turns round the sub- clavian artery, and on the left round the ductus arteriosus and arch of the aorta; it ascends between the trachea and oesophagus, supplies their muscular and mucous coats, and enters the larynx to end in its intrinsic muscles except the crico-thyroid : b, cardiac branches, which arise from the nerve trunk both in the neck and chest, and from the re- current laryngeal nerves; they join the great cardiac plexus and furnish inhibitory nerves for the heart: c, pulmonary branches, which arise in the chest, and form along with the sympathetic an anterior pulmonary plexus in front of, and a posterior pulmonary plexus behind the root of the lung; they enter the lung and supply the bronchial muscles and mucous membrane : d, oesophageal branches form a plexus, and supply the coats of the oesophagus; e, gastric branches, which supply the coats of the stomach, send branches to the liver and to the solar plexus of the sympa- thetic, through which it influences the small intestine, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and supra-renal capsules.

349 THE EYEBALL. external nuclear layer is well marked, and the central fibres belonging to it, instead of passing vertically forwards, incline very oblicpiely or almost horizontally outwards to the internal nuclear layer, which, together with the layers anterior to it, is so thin as almost to have disappeared. In the yellow spot surrounding the fovea, the bacillary layer is also composed of cones which are not, however, so slender or so long as in the fovea itself. The layer of nerve cells and the inner part of the external nuclear layer are thicker than in the rest of the retina. The yellow spot is the part of the retina most sensitive to light. At the ora serrata, or anterior border of the retina, the nervous layers, including the rods and cones, cease to exist. The radial connective tissue and internal limiting membrane are present; from the radial tissue a layer of cells is pro- longed forward in contact with the deep surface of the ciliary processes as the pars ciliaris retinae. The retina is supplied with blood by the arteria centralis, which, traversing the axis of the optic nerve, reaches the retina at the optic disc. In the retina it branches dichotomously in the nerve fibre layer, avoiding, however, the yello-fr spot, and its terminal twigs reach the ora serrata. The capillaries form in the more anterior layers of the retina a distinct network, which does not enter the external granule and bacillary layers, but penetrates the yellow spot, though not the fovea centralis. The blood is conveyed from the retina by the central vein which accompanies the artery in the optic nerve, and opens either into the ophthalmic vein or directly into the cavernous sinus. The veins and capillaries of the retina have been described by His as completely invested by perivascular lymphatic sheaths, whilst the arteries only possess such sheaths for a limited part of their course. These lymphatics leave the

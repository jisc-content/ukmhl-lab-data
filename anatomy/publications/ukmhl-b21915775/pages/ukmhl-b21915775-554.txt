538 ANATOMY. the pancreas join those from the spleen, and the splenic lymphatics accompany the splenic artery, and join the lumbar lymphatics. The lymphatics of the liver have different modes of termination; those from the upper surface communicate with the lymphatics which accompany the internal mammary arteries; those from the under surface join the commencement of the thoracic duct; whilst the deep lymphatics leave the liver at the transverse fissure and join one of the larger lacteals before it opens into the receptaculum chyli. The lymphatics of the supra-renal capsules join those of the kidneys, and the renal lymphatics open into the lumbar chain of lymphatic glands. The lymphatics of the testicles ascend along with the spermatic blood-vessels, and enter the lumbar chain of glands. The Lymphatics of the Lower Limb are arranged in a superficial and a deep set. The superficial lymph-vessels arise in the toes, and on the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the foot; they ascend to the leg, and accompany the internal and external saphenous veins. Those which run up the back of the leg in part pierce the popliteal fascia along with the external saphenous vein, and join the deep popliteal lymphatics; but the others extend to the inner side of the knee, and ascend along with the superficial lymphatics, which accompany the internal saphenous vein, on the anterior surface of the thigh as far as the groin, where they enter the femoral group of lymphatic glands. The superficial glands of the groin are eight or ten in number, and lie in the superficial fascia. It is customary to arrange them in two groups: an inferior, lying parallel

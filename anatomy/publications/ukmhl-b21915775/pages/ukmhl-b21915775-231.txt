MEMBRANES OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 215 the spinal canal, and forms a tubular investment for the spinal cord. It does not serve as a periosteum for the vertebrae, which possess a distinct periosteal covering, between which and the dura mater loose fat and a plexus of veins are situated. It gives off no bands like the falx and tentorium from its inner surface, and it does not split into two layers for the lodgment of venous blood sinuses. It extends from the foramen magnum, where it is continu- ous with the cranial dura mater, to the lower end of the sacral canal, where it ends in a funnel-shaped prolongation. It is pierced laterally by the roots of the several spinal nerves in their passage outwards to the intervertebral foramina, and gives a covering to each, which forms a sheath for the nerve. Both the cranial and the spinal parts of the dura mater- consist of a tough, fibrous membrane, containing numerous elastic fibres; it is flocculent externally, but smooth, glistening, and free on its inner surface. The inner surface has the appearance of a serous membrane, and when examined microscopically is seen to be covered by a layer of squamous endothelial cells, as in fig. 34. Hence the dura mater is sometimes called a fibro-serous membrane. The dura mater is well provided with lymph vessels, which in all probability open by stomata on the free inner surface. Nerves have been traced to the cranial dura mater both from the 5th cranial nerve and the sympathetic. Between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane is a space of only a capillary lumen, containing a minute quantity of limpid serum, which moistens the smooth inner surface of the dura and the corresponding smooth outer surface of the arachnoid. It is regarded as equivalent to the cavity of a serous membrane, and is named the arachnoid cavity,

179 MUSCULAR TISSUE. substance, which is transversely striped. The transverse striae are not mere surface marks, but, as Bowman pointed out, pass through the entire thickness of the fibre and indicate that it may be regarded as built up of a pile of discs superimposed on each other. Dobie described in 1848 the discs as consisting of two kinds of sarcous matter, arranged in a definite manner alternately dark and light, and that the dark discs or bands are broader than the light or clear bands. Dobie also described a dark line passing across the light band, so as to subdivide it into two halves, which line Busk and Huxley showed to be dotted; and this appearance has also been figured by Sharpey. Krause regards the line described by Dobie as due to a fine membrane, attached to the sarco- lemma, which passes transversely across the fibre : he conceives the fibre as divided by these membranes into muscle compartments, each of which contains a dim disc with one half of a clear disc on each of its aspects. Rutherford denies the existence of Krause’s membrane, and holds that Dobie’s line con- sists of a single row of highly refracting globules in the feebly refracting clear disc. Eie. 59.—a trans- Dobie, and more recently Hensen, have also muscular fibre, directed attention to a slender, feebly refracting stripe passing transversely across the strongly refracting dark disc, so as to subdivide it also into two halves. If a piece of muscle be digested in dilute hydrochloric acid, gaps or fissures form transversely in the substance of the fibres (fig. GO), and if the digestion be prolonged the fissures extend completely across the fibre, which may

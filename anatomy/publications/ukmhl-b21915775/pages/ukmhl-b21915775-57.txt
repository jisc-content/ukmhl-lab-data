APPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 41 the radius Being the more external hone, and the palm of the hand being directed forwards ; in the other or Prone position the radius crosses obliquely in front of the ulna, and the palm of the hand is directed backwards. The bones of the fore-arm, and those of the hand are placed in the supine position when they are described. The Kadius (fig. 9) is the outer bone of the Fore-arm, and like all long bones possesses a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity or head has a shallow, smooth cup for moving on the capitellum of the humerus ; the outer margin of the cup is also smooth, for articulation with the ulna and annular ligament; below the cup is a constricted neck, and immediately below the neck a tuberosity for the inser- tion of the biceps. The shaft of the bone possesses three surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and a sharp inner border for the interosseous membrane. The lower end of the bone is much broader than the upper, and is marked posteriorly by grooves for the extensor tendons passing to the back of the hand: from its outer border a pointed styloid process projects downwards ; its inner border has a §mooth shallow fossa for articulation with the ulna, and its broad lower surface is smooth and concave, for articulation with the scaphoid and semilunar bones of the wrist. The Ulna (fig. 9) is the inner bone of the Forearm. Its upper end is divided into two strong processes by a deep fossa, the greater sigmoid cavity, which possesses a smooth surface for articulation with the trochlea of the humerus. The anterior or coronoid process is marked by an oblique ridge for the insertion of the brachialis anticus, whilst the posterior or olecranon process gives insertion to the large triceps muscle of the upper arm. Immediately below the outer border of the great sigmoid cavity is the small sigmoid cavity for articulation with the side of the head of the radius. The shaft of the bone has three surfaces foT the

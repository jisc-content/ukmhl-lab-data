ANATOMY-. 316 shaped bend of the facial, which may be the path of taste fibres continued through the facial to the chorda tympani: a third to the small petrosal and otic ganglion, and through the latter to the auriculo-temporal of the 5 th, through which connection the glosso-pharyngeal may act as the secretory nerve for the parotid gland. From the petrous ganglion a branch arises which forms a loop with the digastric branch of the portio dura and perhaps conveys motor fibres to the glosso-pharyngeal from the portio dura. The Pneumogastrie or Vagus, the middle division of the 8 th cranial nerve, springs out of the side of the medulla between the olivary and restiform bodies; its roots arise from the nucleus pneumogastricus in the floor of the 4th ventricle, from the nucleus ambiguus situated deeper in the medulla, and from the solitary or respiratory fasciculus, which descends in the formatio reticularis and lateral column of the cord, as far as the cervical enlargement, where it comes into relation with the origin of the phrenic nerre. It goes through the jugular foramen, is joined by the inner division of the spinal accessory, which is its motor root, then passes down the side of the neck within the carotid sheath, enters the thorax, inclines behind the root of the lung, reaches the outer wall of the oesophagus, accompanies that tube through the diaphragm, and termi- nates in the wall of the stomach. The left nerve lies on a plane anterior to the right: it crosses in front of the arch of the aorta, and is distributed to the anterior wall of the stomach, whilst the right nerve supplies the posterior wall. Each nerve possesses two enlargements, the upper and lower ganglia. The upper ganglion lies in the jugular foramen; it communicates with the sympathetic and glosso-pharyngeal, and gives origin to the auricular branch,

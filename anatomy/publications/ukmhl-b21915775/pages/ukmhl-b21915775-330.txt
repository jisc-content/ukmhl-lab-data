ANATOMY. 314 membrane. I have also observed two cases in which the long buccal nerve arose as a branch of the sensory superior maxillary nerve. The larger division separates into three branchesâ€”a, auricido-temporal, which ascends to supply the parotid gland, the temporo-maxillary joint, and, as the superficial temporal nerve, supplies the skin of the auricle, external meatus, and temple : b, inferior dental, which enters the dental canal in the lower jaw, supplies the lower set of teeth, and, emerging through the mental foramen, as the mental nerve, supplies the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip; the inferior dental also gives off a mylo- hyoid branch to the mylo-hyoid and anterior belly of the digastric muscle: c, lingual or gustatory, which, accom- panied by the chorda tympani, runs forward along the side of the tongue to end in the filiform and fungiform papillse of its mucous membrane. The lingual branches are sensory nerves of touch, and many physiologists believe that they are also nerves of taste. Connected with the branches of the inferior maxillary division are two small ganglia, which, like the ciliary and spheno-palatine ganglia, are of a greyish colour, contain nerve cells, and receive roots from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves. The Submaxillary ganglion lies under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle, and receives a root from the chorda tympani which contains the secretory fibres of that nerve, a root from the sensory lingual, and a sympathetic root from the plexus on the facial artery. It gives branches toThe sub-maxillary and sublingual salivary glands. The Otic ganglion lies close to the Eustachian tube, and in front of the middle meningeal artery. It receives a motor root from the nerve to the internal pterygoid, a sensory root from the auriculo-tetuporal, and a sympathetic root from the plexus on the middle

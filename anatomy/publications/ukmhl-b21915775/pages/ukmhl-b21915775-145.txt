129 TIIE BLOOD. corpuscle can by these movements include within its sub- stance, or feed upon, minute particles of solid matter which it may come in contact with in its path. Many years ago W. Addison stated that the white blood corpuscles could pass through the walls of the blood-vessels into the surrounding tissue, where they formed mucus corpuscles, and, under certain pathological conditions, the corpuscles of pus or inflammatory lymph. The passage of white blood corpuscles through the wall of the capillaries was seen in 1846 by A. Waller ; and though for many years his observations were ignored, yet the more recent inquiries of Cohnheim and others into the subject have again directed attention to them. It is now admitted that the migration or diapeclesis of these corpuscles from the blood through the wall of the capillaries into the tissues does take place, and that they then “ wander ” to and fro, owing to the mobility of their contractile protoplasm. These migrated corpuscles are believed to play an important part in many physiological and pathological processes. But the blood contains in addition to the red and white corpuscles, smaller particles, inconstant in number. Cor- puscles about ^th the size of the white corpuscles and perhaps these in their early stage have been seen. Minute globules have been described by Beale and Max Schultze, which are probably detached fragments of protoplasm budded off from the white corpuscles; and Zimmermann has described, as elementary corpuscles, minute particles, which are apparently derived from broken-up red corpuscles. Development op Blood-corpuscles. In the very young embryo the blood corpuscles, like the capillary blood-vessels themselves, are formed by special differentiation of the mesoblast cells of the vascular area, the nuclei of which multiply by lission and form the embryonic blood corpuscles, which at first are I

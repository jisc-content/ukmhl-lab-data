330 ANATOMY. brain the olfactory peduncle is in relation with the olfactory sulcus on the under surface of the frontal lobe (fig. 88). It is a white band, which passes back to the trigonum or tuber olfadorium, situated immediately in front of the locus perforatus anticus, where it divides into its so-called roots. The external or long root passes outwards to the uncinate gyrus, which is the convolutionary centre of the sense of smell (Ferrier). The internal or short root has been traced into the anterior end of the gyrus fornicatus. The middle or grey root is continuous with the locus per- foratus anticus. Broca has also described a superior root continuous with the white matter of the adjacent part of the frontal lobe. But further, the peduncle receives some fibres from the anterior commissure, which are more numerous in those animals that possess a strong sense of smell and a large olfactory lobe. The olfactory bidbs rest on the upper surface of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, one on each side of the crista galli. Each bulb consists both of grey and white matter, and sometimes retains the central cavity lined by a ciliated epithelium. The grey matter contains fusiform and pyramidal nerve cells imbedded in neuroglia (the stratum gelatinosum of L. Clarke). Between it and the central cavity is the white matter formed of nerve fibres interspersed with “granules,” similar to those seen in the rust-coloured layer of the cere- bellum. Between the grey matter and the surface is the stratum glomerulosum of Meynert, which apparently consists of coils of the olfactory nerve fibres with interspersed “granules.” The olfactory nerve fibres form the first pair of cranial nerves or nerves of smell; they leave these coils in from 15 to 25 bundles, and enter the roof of the nose through the holes in the cribriform plate; they lie in

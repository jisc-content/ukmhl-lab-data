ACCESSORY PARTS TO THE EYEBALL. 357 free surface and columnar cells in the deepest layer. In the sub-epithelial tissue are small branched mucous glands, which are numerous in the caruncula. Little masses of adenoid tissue (p. 145) with lymphatic vessels are also found in it, and the conjunctiva of the front of the eyeball is thinner than the palpebral part. It is not glandular, and its nerves terminate in end-bulbs (p. 201). The palpebral conjunctiva, and in part that of the eyeball, receive their blood-vessels from those of the eye-lids, but the portion of the conjunctiva next the cornea is supplied by the arteries of the sclerotic coat. The Lachrymal Apparatus is en- gaged in the secre- tion of the tears, and in conveying them away from the front of the globe. The lach- rymal gland occu- pies a depres- sion in the outer part of the roof of the orbit. It is smaller than Fig. 105.â€”Lachrymal Canals and Duct. 1, orbicular muscle; 2 and 3, lachrymal canals; 4, caruncula; 5, an almond, is lachrymal sac; 6, lachrymal duct; 7. angular artery. divided into lobules, and belongs to the group of com- pound racemose glands. It consists of the ramifications of short ducts, which terminate in clusters of small sac- culi. The wall of each sacculus consists of a delicate membrana propria, and the cavity contains the poly- hedral secreting cells. Outside the membrana propria is a capillary network derived from the lachrymal artery,

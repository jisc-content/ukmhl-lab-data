THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. 267 nodule, the tuber cinereum; from which, cl, the infundibulum projects to join the 'pituitary body. Immediately in front of the optic commissure is a grey layer, the lamina cinerea or lamina terminalis of the 3rd ventricle : in front of this lamina is the antero-inferior end of the great longitudinal fissure: between the optic commissure and tract and the inner end of each Sylvian fissure is a grey layer, perforated by small arteries, the locus perforatus anticus (fig. 94). The Mantle or peripheral part of each hemisphere, consists of grey matter, which has a characteristic folded appearance, known as the convolutions or gym of the cerebrum. These convolutions are separated from each other by furrows, fissures, or sulci. Some of the fissures are so deep as to cause corresponding elevations on the wall of the ventricle, e.g., the Sylvian, parieto-occipital, hippocampal and calcarine fissures (p. 210); others are shallower and form indentations only on the surface of the hemisphere. Some of the fissures divide the hemisphere into lobes, whilst others separate the convolutions in each lobe from each other. In each hemisphere of the human brain five lobes are recognised : the temporo-sphenoidal, frontal, parietal, occipital, and the central lobe or insula. The Sylvian fissure passes from the locus perforatus anticus obliquely, upwards and backwards, aloDg the outer face of the hemisphere; the temporo-sphenoidal lobe lies below it, and above and in front are the parietal and frontal lobes. A short ascending branch passes from its anterior end into the inferior frontal convolution. The elevation in the ventricle corresponding to the Sylvian fissure is the corpus striatum. The fissure of Rolando extends from the mesial longitudinal fissure obliquely downwards and forwards on the outer face of the hemisphere almost to the Sylvian

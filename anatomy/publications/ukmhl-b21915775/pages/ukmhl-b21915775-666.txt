650 ANATOMY. mucous membrane proceed; the one extends downwards and forwards as the anterior pillar of the fauces to the side of the tongue, and encloses the palato-glossus muscle; the other runs downwards and backwards, as the posterior pillar of the fauces, to the wall of the pharynx, and encloses the palato-pharyngeus muscle. In the interval between these pillars is the tonsil. In its structure the mucous lining of the mouth consists of a stratified pavement epithelium, and a sub-epithelial fibro-vascular corium, possessing numerous vascular papillae. The superficial strata of the epithelium covering the mucous surface of the cheeks and lips are formed of squamous cells, whilst those which lie next the corium are elongated in a direction perpendicular to its surface. Some of the squamous cells have fluted surfaces; others prickle-like edges, by the junction of which adjacent cells anastomose together. From the surface of the corium numerous coni- cal vascular papillae project into the epithelial layer. At the margin of the lip the mucous membrane becomes con- tinuous with the integument, and the transition from the tegumentary to the mucous surface is marked by the dis- appearance of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands, by the greater translucency of the epithelial covering and by the greater vascularity of the corium. Klein has described bundles of fibres of the sphincter orbicularis oris muscle passiug into the corium of the mucous lining of the lip, as far as the base of the papillae, and in close proximity to the epithelium. The mucous membrane of the gum is characterised by its density and toughness, due to the numerous strongly developed bundles of connective tissue in the corium,

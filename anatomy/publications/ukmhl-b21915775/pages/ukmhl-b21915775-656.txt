ANATOMY. 640 tributed in the fibro-elastic membranous wall of the air- vesicles, passes into the intermediate septa, and forms a ring-like arrangement around the mouths of the air- cells. Its constituent capillaries are very fine, and form an extremely close polygonal meshwork, so that the lung is one of the most vascular of all the organs. The capillaries lie immediately beneath the lining epithelium of the air-vesicles, and are separated by it alone from the air in the air-cells, the anatomical arrangement being such as to facilitate the interchange of gases between the air and the blood ; by which the impure venous blood of the pulmonary artery is converted into pure arterial blood, in which state it flows into the pulmonary veins back to the left side ofâ€™the heart. The pulmonary veins arise in great part by small rootlets from the pulmonary capillary plexus. The rootlets from adja- cent pulmonary infundibula, and lobules unite to form larger veins, which accompany the pulmonary artery and leave the lung at the root as two large venous trunks. To some extent also the rootlets of the pulmonary veins arise from a capillary plexus in the walls of the finer bronchi derived from the bronchial artery. The most superficial twigs of the pulmonary veins, which arise from the capillary plexus on the air-vesicles near the surface of the lung, ramify for some distance in the sub-serous connective tissue, when they either join the pulmonary vein at the root of the lung, or sink into its substance to open into some of the more deeply placed pulmonary veins. The bronchial or nutrient artery of the lung arises either from the thoracic aorta, or from an intercostal artery, and enters the lung along with the bronchial tube. It is in

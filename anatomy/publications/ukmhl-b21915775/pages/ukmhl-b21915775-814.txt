ANATOMY. 798 almost absent in tlie region of tbe trigone of the bladder. The mucous or internal coat is thrown into folds or rugae in the empty bladder, owing to the laxity of the sub-mucous coat, but, when the bladder is distended, the mucous coat is smooth. The mucous lining of the base of the bladder is, however, smooth, even in the contracted bladder, over a triangular surface, bounded behind by a line drawn transversely between the two uretral openings, and on each side by a line drawn from the uretral orifice to the opening of the urethra. This triangular surface is called the trigone of the bladder, and it corresponds, internally ? to a triangular region on the outside of the base of the bladder, bounded on each side by the vesicula seminalis and vas deferens, in front by the prostate gland, and behind by the line of reflection of the peritoneum from the rectum to the bladder. The free surface of the mucous membrane is covered by a stratified epithelium, the cells of which are multiform in Fio. 223.â€”Epithelial cells from the mucous membrane of the Bladder.

The superficial stratum consists of large flattened cells with large distinct nuclei; the middle stratum con- sists of pear-shaped cells, the broad ends of which are in

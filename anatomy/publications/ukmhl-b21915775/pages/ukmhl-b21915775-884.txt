ANATOMY. 868 appears, either by becoming incorporated with the sub- zonal membrane, so as no longer to be recognised as an independent membrane, or by becoming absorbed. The sub-zonal membrane, or serous envelope of the ovum of Von Baer, originally continuous with the amniotic folds, and through them with the epiblast layer of the blasto- derm, persists, and forms the epithelial, non-vascular epi- blast layer of the persistent chorion, and of the villi which grow from it. The allantois forms the inner or vascular layer of the persistent cb orion, and the vascular matrix of the villi; but in some of the Tlodentia, the umbilical vesicle reaches and remains in contact with a limited portion of the sub-zonal membrane, to which it' conveys connective tissue and blood-vessels. The persistent chorion, therefore, is a compound membrane, produced secondarily during the process of development by the union of the sub-zonal, epiblast membrane, from which its epithelial layer is derived, with the allantois, from which it derives its blood- vessels and connective tissue â€¢ and like the embryo itself it arises from the layers of the blastoderm. The allantois undergoes considerable modifications in both size and general disposition in the different orders of mammals. In many mammals, as the Pachydermata, Ruminantia, Cetacea, Carnivora, Pinnipedia, the Lemurs, and the Scaly Anteaters (Manis), the sac of the allantois persists as a distinct chamber, and contains a considerable quantity of allantoic fluid. Of the opposite walls of the sac, the one lines, to a greater or less extent, the inner surface of the permanent chorion, which is coated there- fore by the epithelial lining of the allantois; the other invests, to a greater or less extent, the outer surface of

ANATOMY. 466 artery when on the face is crossed by the branches of the facial nerve, but the facial vein is not in close relation to it. From it arise an ascending palatine branch, which ascends between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles to supply the wall of the pharynx, tonsil, and soft palate: a tonsillar branch to the tonsil and side of the tongue: glandular branches to the sub-maxillary gland: a sub- mental branch, which runs below the lower jaw to the chin : posterior facial branches, which run backwards to the masse- teric region : inferior labial branch, which runs forward to the skin and muscles of the lower lip : two coronary branches, one to run along the free margin of each lip immediately beneath the mucous membrane,â€”each inoscu- lates with the corresponding artery of the opposite side, and forms an arterial arch, and from the superior coronary arch the septal artery ascends to the nasal septum : lateral nasal, a branch distributed to the side of the nose. The terminal part of the facial is the angular artery, which anastomoses at the inner angle of the orbit with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. d. Occipital artery arises from the posterior surface of the external carotid, and passes upwards and backwards to the occipital region. It goes under cover of the posterior belly of the digastric, and is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve; it then reaches the mastoid-temporal and occipital bones, where it is covered by the sterno-mastoid, splenius, and often by the trachelo-mastoid muscle, whilst it rests on the complexus and superior oblique. It then passes through the occipital origin of the trapezius, along with the great occipital nerve, and is distributed to the back of the scalp. From it arise a sterno-mastoid branch to the

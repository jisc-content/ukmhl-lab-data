APPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 37 whilst its posterior segment, the scapula, approaches, but does not reach, the dorsal spines. The Clavicle, or Collar Bone (fig. 9), is an elongated bone which extends from the upper end of the sternum horizontally outwards, to articulate with the acromion process of the scapula. It presents a strong sigmoidal curve, which is associated with the transverse and horizontal direction of the axis of the human shoulder. It is slender in the female, but powerful in muscular males; its sternal end is thick and somewhat triangular ; its acromial end, flattened from above downwards, has an oval articular Fig. 8.—Diagrammatic Transverse Section to represent tire relations of the Shoulder Girdle to the Trunk.

Its shaft has four surfaces for the attachment of muscles; a strong ligament, connecting it with the coracoid, is attached to the under surface, near the outer end, whilst near the inner a strong ligament passes between it and the 1st rib. The clavicle is absent in hoofed quadrupeds, in seals and whales, and is feeble in the carnivora ; but is well formed, not only in man, but in apes, bats, and in many rodents and insectivora. The Scapula, or Shoulder Blade (fig. 9), is the most important bone of the shoulder girdle, and is present in all mammals. It lies at the upper and back part of the wall of the chest, reaching from the 2d to the 7th

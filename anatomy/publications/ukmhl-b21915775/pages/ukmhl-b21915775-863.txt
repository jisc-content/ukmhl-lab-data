VAGINA. 847 THE VAGINA. The vagina is the tube which extends from the uterus to the vulva. It is about 5 inches long, and curves from above downwards and forwards. Posteriorly it is related to the rectum, from which it is separated, in the greater part of its extent, by the thin recto-vaginal layer of the pelvic fascia, whilst between its upper end and the rectum is the bottom of the pouch of Douglas, lined by the peri- toneum. Anteriorly it is related to the bladder and urethra, the latter of which is imbedded in the anterior wall of the vagina. Laterally, the levatores aui muscles and the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia are attached to it. This fascia gives a thin prolongation in front of the . vagina, which at the same time encloses the urethra. The upper end of the vagina embraces the cervix uteri, and extends in a marked degree higher up behind than in front, so that the protrusion of the posterior lip of the os uteri into the vagina is much greater than that of the anterior lip. The lower end of the vagina opens in the vulva, at the bottom of the vestibule between the two nymphrn, and behind the orifice of the urethra; the diameter of this opening is somewhat less than that of the tube of the vagina. Structure.â€”The vagina possesses an external coat of connective tissue derived from the pelvic fascia. Beneath this coat is the muscular coat, formed of fasciculi of non- striped muscle, arranged both longitudinally and cir- cularly, which are continuous above with the muscular wall of the uterus. The inner coat is formed of the

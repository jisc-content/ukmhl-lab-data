339 THE EYEBALL. appearance. This stroma connects the outer surface of the choroid with the inner surface of the sclerotic, and forms the lamina fusca. In the stroma are lymph spaces, blood- vessels, and nerves. Non-striped muscle cells have also been described as arranged in a meridional direction. The vessels of the choroid are arranged in two layers. Next the lamina vitrea is a plexiform capillary layer, the meshes of which are so minute, and the vessels so close to- gether, as to give the appearance of a vascular membrane, long known as the membrana Ruyschiana. The capillaries radiate like minute stars from the terminal twigs of the choroidal arteries and veins, which form a layer external to the capillaries, i.e., next the lamina fusca. Between the layer of capillaries and the layer of choroidal arteries and veins is the elastic layer of Sattler, and an endothelial membrane. The arteries are the short posterior ciliary branches of the ophthalmic artery, which pierce the sclerotic close to the entrance of the optic nerve, and, running for- wards in a tortuous manner, divide dichotomously before ending in capillaries. The veins of the choroid are arranged in a series of remarkable whorls, named the venae, vorticosae, which receive the blood not only from the capil- laries of the choroid proper, but from those of the iris and ciliaiy body , they discharge their blood by means of from 4 to 6 veins into the ophthalmic vein. The Corpus ciliare, or annulus albidus, is a greyish-white ring, which surrounds the anterior border of the choroid close to the junction of the sclerotic and cornea. It consists of two portionsâ€”an external, the ciliary muscle, which lies next the sclerotic, and an internal, the ciliary processes. The ciliary processes, about 80 in number, are folds of the middle tunic separated from each other by furrows, which extend forwards in the meridional direction

ANATOMY. 134 The coriuni is also the seat of numerous glands, with their blood and lymph vessels and nerves; and the epithelial lining of the glands is continuous at their orifices with the epithelial investment of the corium. The surface both of the mucous membranes and skin is usually more or less undulated—sometimes it is thrown into strong folds or rugae, at others it is elevated into minute, frequently conical, processes, named in some localities papillae, in others villi; but in all these cases the epithelium is prolonged as a con- tinuous covering over the undulating free surface. The free surface of all mucous membranes is kept moist by the secretion or mucus which lubricates it. Squamous, tessellated, ‘pavement, or scaly epithelium is usually stratified, and as such occurs on the free surface of the mucous lining of the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, vestibular entrance to the nose, ocular con- junctiva, vagina, and entrance to the urethra. It forms under Fig. 30.—Sculy Epithelium from tire mucous membrane of the mouth. £]le special name of the horny layer of the cuticle or epidermis, the superficial invest- ment of the skin. Its cells are flattened scales, varying in diameter from -g-j^th to two^1 ancl witl1 flattened nuclei. They have a granular appearance due to the intra-cellular plexus of flue fibrils; a similar plexus exists within the nucleus. The cells are connected together by a cement substance; those in the same layer, being in contact by their edges, form a tessellated, pave- ment-like arrangement, whilst the cells in contiguous layers have their flattened surfaces in contact with each other. The cells in the deeper layers have often fluted

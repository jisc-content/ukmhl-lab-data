The inner surface of the wall of the sac is lined by some layers of cells which constitute the membrana granulosa, or so-called epithelium of the Graafian follicle.

At one spot they form a little mass called the cumulus, or discus proligerus, in which the ovum is im- bedded. The Graafian follicle contains some liquid, secreted doubtless through the agency of these cells, and, as the secretion accumulates, the follicle approaches the

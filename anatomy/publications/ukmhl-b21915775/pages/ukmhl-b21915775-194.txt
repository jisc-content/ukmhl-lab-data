178 ANATOMY. series ; in most insects the fibres being of extreme minute- ness, whilst in cold-blooded animals they are much larger than in man and mammals. A fibre should be carefully separated from a fasciculus, and examined microscopically by transmitted light. As the fibres of the water beetle and some other invertebrates are larger than those of mammalia, they are often employed for this purpose. Each fibre is invested by a homogeneous elastic membrane, the myolemma or sarcolemma (Bowman), which being translucent allows the characteristic transverse striae to be distinctly seen through it. The sarcolemma is so closely incorporated with the periphery of the fibre, that its isolation and demonstration as a distinct membrane in the fibres of the mammalia are attended with some diffi- culty ; but when water is added to the living fibre of frogs and fish, it is absorbed, and elevates the sarcolemma from the sarcous contractile particles. Thin describes the sarco- lemma as being covered by a layer of fiat cells. If acetic acid be added to a muscular fibre the transverse strife become less distinct, and a number of oval bodies come into view. These lie in the mammalia in close relation to the inner surface of the sarcolemma, but in many animals they are also deeper in the substance of the fibre. These bodies have long been kuown as the nuclei of the striped fibre. Each nucleus is imbedded in a little finely-dotted protoplasm, which often extends in a fusiform mauner beyond the ends of the nucleus. The nucleus itself contains a network of delicate fibrils (Flemming). These nuclei, with their investing protoplasm, have the anatomical characters of nucleated cells, and are called the muscle corpuscles. The sarcolemma encloses the proper sarcous contractile

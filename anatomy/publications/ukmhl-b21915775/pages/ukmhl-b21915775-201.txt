MUSCULAR TISSUE. 185 around tlie fibre. In the development of the muscular fibres of the heart, the cells of the embryo heart branch and anastomose, and the nuclei multiply. By the transverse striation of the protoplasm of these cells the branched muscular fibres of the heart are produced. In the growth of a muscle the individual fibres increase in size, so that they are larger in the adult than at the time of birth. The observations of Budge, Weismann, and Beale show that new fibres may also form in a muscle. Weismann believes that this increase may be due to a longitudinal splitting of a pre-existing fibre ; but Beale maintains that the new fibres are produced in the muscle in the same manner as the original fibres of the part. The Nervous Tissue, the tissues which form the Blood and Lymph Vessels and the Dental Tissues, will be described in the chapters on the Nervous and Vascular systems and on the Teeth.

Their normal size is not bigger than a hazel nut, but they are very apt to enlarge, grow inwards across the posterior aperture of the mouth, and diminish the size of that opening. The free surface is marked by several round- ed holes, which lead into shallow pits or crypts, which may be either simple or branched, in the sub- stance of the tonsil. The pits are lined by the epi- thelial covering of the mucous membrane, into which minute papillae pro- ject. In the sub-epithelial connective tissue of the walls of the crypts nume- rous follicles of lymphoid tissue are situated, and lymph cells are infiltrated in great .numbers in the connective tissue between the follicles. Interspersed amidst the crypts are small racemose mucous glands. The tonsils are very vascular, and receive their arteries from the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary, the ascending pharyngeal of the external carotid, the dorsalis linguae of the lingual, and the tonsillar and ascending palatine branches of the facial. Capillary blood-vessels are distributed in connection with the papillae, the lymphoid tissue, and the racemose glands. The tonsillar veins form a plexus in relation to the attached surface of the tonsil. Lymph- vessels are found in the tonsils; they form networks Fig. ITS.â€”Vertical section through one of the Tonsils, to show a pit vertically divided, e.

624 ANATOMY. is the posterior mediastinum. It contains the descending thoracic aorta, the oesophagus, and nervi vagi, the vena azygos, thoracic duct with lymphatic glands, and the splanchnic nerves. As the pericardium does not extend so high as the level of the top of the sternum, the inter- pleural space between the manubrium sterni and the higher dorsal vertebras lies above the pericardium, and J. Struthers has suggested that the name stcperior mediastinum should be given to it. It contains the two innominate veins, the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries, the upper thoracic portion of the phrenic, pneumo- gastric and cardiac nerves, a part of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, the trachea, and the upper thoracic part of the oesophagus and thoracic duct. The pleura, like other serous membranes, possesses two surfaces, an attached surface and a free surface. By its attached surface the pleura is connected by areolar tissue to the ribs, intercostal muscles, diaphragm, pericardium, and lung. The free surface of the parietal pleura is smooth, and in apposition with the corresponding free surface of the pulmonic pleura. These two free surfaces glide on each other as the lungs and thoracic walls rise and fall during inspiration and expiration ; and, as the surfaces are lubricated by a little serous fluid, the movement is faci- litated. This fluid occupies a scarcely appreciable interval between the free surfaces of the parietal and visceral pleura, which interval forms the so-called pleural cavity. The pleural cavity becomes distinct when any cause operates to push the lung from the wall of the chest; such as the introduction of air into the pleural cavity, either through an external wound, or from rupture of the lung;

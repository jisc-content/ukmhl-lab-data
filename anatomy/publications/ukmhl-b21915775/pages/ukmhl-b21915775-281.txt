THE BRAINâ€”CORPORA QUADRIGEMINA. 265 remarkable zone-like arrangement of nerve cells lies at the circumference of the dorsal aspect and sides of this central grey layer. In vertical transverse sections (fig. 84) they may be seen to lie singly, but usually in groups of from two to six cells. They are much larger than the ordinary cells of the central layer, and consist of a globular body giving origin to one or two processes. These cells lie in a tract of well-defined nerve fibres, to which they have apparently a relation like that of the cells in a spinal nerve ganglion to the fibres of the posterior root. Outside this zone is the peripheral layer of grey matter containing small multipolar nerve cells, which, especially in the nates, give origin through the anterior brachium to many fibres of the optic tract. The corpus geniculatum internum contains small multipolar nerve cells. The nerve fibres of the lemniscus penetrate the corpora quadrigemina between the peripheral and central grey layers, and form a trans- verse arrangement, and some of these decussate in the mesial plane. Some fibres from the corpora quadrigemina may ascend to the cerebrum. It is now maintained that the superior peduncles of the cerebellum do not end in the corpora quadrigemina but pass upwards to the optic thalami (Forel), or even to the cortex of the hemisphere (Meynert). In their course they decussate and form a horse-shoe shaped commissure or raphe, in which a mass of nerve cells, nucleus tegmenti is situated (Schwalbe.) The Crus Cerebri, except in its locus niger, is exclusively for con- duction of nerve impulses. The locus niger .and the grey matter of the Corpora Quadrigemina are centres of origin for the 3d, 4tli, and in part the optic nerve. Other nerve fibres, e.g., those of the posterior brachium and the lemniscus either arise or terminate in this grey matter.

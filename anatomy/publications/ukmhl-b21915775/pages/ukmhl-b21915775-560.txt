ANATOMY. 544 Two sets of capillary vessels occur in the tissues and organs, the blood capillaries and the lymph capillaries. The network of lymph capillaries is not continuous with or even in contact with the network of blood capillaries, but the lymph capillaries lie in the meshes of the blood capillary network, and are separated from them by inter- vening tissue elements. The blood which flows into the blood capillaries from the arterial system is for the most part conveyed directly onwards into the veins; but from blood is subjected, in part its liquor sanguinis, with perhaps some white cor- puscles, transudes through the delicate coats of the capillaries into the tissues. That which is required for the nutrition of the tissue is applied to that purpose. That which is not needed would accumulate in the tissues, were it not that a drainage system is pro- vided by means of the plasma channels, whch con- vey it into the lymph capil- laries, and from them it is transmitted into the larger lymph vessels. Hence, while there is only one channel, viz., the arterial, for conveying pabulum to the tissues of an organ, there are two channels, viz., the venous and lymphatic, for conveying the pressure to which the Fig. 146. -Diagram of the relation of the Blood and Lymph Capillaries amidst the tissues.

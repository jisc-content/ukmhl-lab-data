254 ANATOMY. The Pons is both a conductor of nerve impulses through its nerve fibres, and a centre of origin of nerve fibres from nerve cells. Roots of the facial and auditory divisions of the 7th, and of the 6th and 5th nerves arise in its grey matter. It is possible that some of the pedun- cular or cerebral fibres end in its nerve cells, and that some of the transverse or cerebellar fibres arise from them. CEREBELLUM. The Cerebellum, Little Brain, or After Brain (figs. 81, 91), occupies the inferior pair of occipital fossae, and, along with the pons and medulla oblongata, lies below the plane of the tentorium cerebelli. It is somewhat ellipsoidal in form, its longer diameter being transverse. It consists of two hemispheres or lateral lobes, and of a median or central lobe, which in human anatomy is called the vermiform process. It is connected below with the medulla oblongata by the two restiform bodies, its inferior peduncles; above to the corpora quadrigemina by two bands, its superior peduncles; whilst the two hemispheres are connected together by the transverse fibres of the pons which form the middle peduncles of the cerebellum. On the superior or tentorial surface of the cerebellum the median or vermiform lobe is elevated (fig. 92 u) above the plane of the hemispheres, and terminates in front in a slender tongue-like process the lingula (p. 261). On its inferior or occipital surface this lobe forms a well-defined inferior vermiform process, which lies at the bottom of a deep fossa or vallecula (fig. 81); this fossa is prolonged to the posterior border of the cerebellum, and forms there a deep notch which separates the two hemispheres from each other; in this notch the falx cerebelli is lodged. Extend- ing horizontally backwards from the middle cerebellar peduncle, along the outer border of each hemisphere is the great horizontal fissure, which divides the cerebellum into

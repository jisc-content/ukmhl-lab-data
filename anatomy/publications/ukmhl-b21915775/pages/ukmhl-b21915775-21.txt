The axis of the spine lies obliquely to the vertical dotted line. (After Goodsir.) Fig. 4.—Outline Diagram of a Monkey in the semi - erect position. The axis of the spine lies obliquely to the vertical dotted line. (After Goodsir.) certain descriptive terms have been recommended which may be employed whether the position of the body be erect or non-erect. Thus, the aspect of parts directed towards

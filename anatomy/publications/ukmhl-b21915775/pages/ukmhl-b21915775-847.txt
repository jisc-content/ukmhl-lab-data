831 OVARY. contains, not only a minutely granulated material, but a dark definite spot, the germinal spot or nucleolus, about .. 0\) utli inch in diameter. The zona pellucida is appa. rently formed by a differentiation of the peripheral part of the yelk protoplasm. The ovary receives its supply of blood from the ovarian artery which enters it at the hilus. It divides into small branches in the fibrous medulla, which pass out- wards to the cortex, and form capil- lary plexuses in the walls of the Graafian follicles. The veins which leave the ovaries form a well-marked plexus, called the pampiniform plexus, between the layers of the broad ligament. Lymphatics also pass out at the hilus: they form within the ovary a capillary plexus, and are continuous with lymph spaces situated around the Graafian follicles; according to His they pass into the substance of the corpora lutea. The nerves proceed from the sympathetic plexus which accom- panies the ovarian artery, and have been traced towards the Graafian follicles, but their'mode of termination is not known.

From the observations of Waldeyer, it would seem that the ovary appears as a thickening, or small eminence, on the median aspect of the Wolffian body in the early embryo. It consists of two parts, a superficial epithelium, and a

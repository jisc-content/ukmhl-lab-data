ANATOMY. 238 outer side of the forearm, both in front and behind, d, The Ulnar nerve from the inner cord, passes through the upper arm, enters the forearm between the inner condyle and olecranon, and the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, when it supplies an articidar branch to the elbow-joint. Here it may easily be compressed, when a pricking sensation is experienced in the course of its distribution. In this spot it is popularly called the “ funny bone.” In the forearm the ulnar nerve supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and inner part of the flexor profundus digitorum. In the hand it supplies the palmaris brevis, the muscles of the ball of the little finger, the two inner lumbricales, the interossei muscles, and the adductor and deep part of the short flexor of the thumb. It also supplies a dorsal cutaneous branch to the back of the hand, and the back of the little and of the ulnar side of the ring digits. Palmar cutaneous branches are also given to the palm and to the palmar aspects of the same digits, e, The Median nerve arises by two roots, one from the inner, the other from the outer cord of the plexus. It passes down the upper arm, enters the forearm in front of the elbow-joint between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, and supplies, either directly or through its anterior interosseoics branch, all the pronators and flexors, except the flexors supplied by the ulnar; it is continued to the hand, where it supplies the abductor, opponens, and superficial part of the short flexor of the thumb, and the two outer lumbrical muscles. It also supplies a palmar cutaneous branch to the skin of the palm, and gives digital cutaneous branches to the thumb, index, and middle digits, and radial side of the ring digit. The Lumbar Plexus, of large size, is situated at the back of the abdominal cavity in the region of the loins, and is

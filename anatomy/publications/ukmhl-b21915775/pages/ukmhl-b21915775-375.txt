ACCESSOEY PAETS TO THE EYEBALL. 359 nasal or lachrymal duct, proceeds, which opens into the inferior meatus of the nose, and here the tears mingle with the mucous secretion of that cavity. Muscles of the Eyeball.—The sclerotic coat of the eyeball has six muscles inserted into it. Four Recti muscles, situated one superior, one inferior, one external, another internal to the globe. They all arise from the ri m of bone which bounds the optic foramen, and the external rectus has two heads. The external and internal muscles are inserted vertically into the sides of the sclerotic, but the superior and inferior recti have oblique insertions into its upper and lower aspects. The two other muscles are called Obliqui. The superior oblique arises along with the recti, passes to the inner end of the upper border of the orbit, where its tendon goes through a pulley, and is directed backwards and outwards, to be inserted, between the supei’ior and external recti, obliquely into the upper and outer part of the sclerotic. The inferior oblique arises from the inner end of the lower border of the orbit, runs out- wards and upwards, to be inserted obliquely into the sclerotic close to the superior oblique. These muscles roll the eyeball in the orbit, and, without entering into a minute analysis, their action may be stated generally as follows :—The internal rectus rolls it horizontally inwards, the external outwards, about its vertical axis; the superior rectus rolls it upwards, the inferior downwards, about its transverse horizontal axis, though from the obliquity of their insertions the superior also gives it a slight inward, the inferior also a slight outward movementj the superior and inferior oblique roll the globe about its antero-posterior or sagittal axis, the superior upwards and inwards, the inferior downwards and outwards. Periosteal Muscle of the Orbit.—The periosteum of the

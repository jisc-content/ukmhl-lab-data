The nervous elements of the retina will first be con- sidered. The optic nerve fibres (2), where they pierce the sclerotic, as a rule lose the medullary sheath, and radiate outwards from the optic disc to the ora serrata as axial cylinders, immediatly behind and parallel to the mem- brana limitans interna. These fibres vary greatly in size, and are frequently varicose. When any optic nerve fibres retain the medullary sheath the retina is there rendered opaque. Immediately behind the nerve fibres is Fic. 101.â€”Diagrammatic antero-posterior section through the Retina to show the several layers which are numbered as in the text. Ct, the radial fibres of the supporting connective tissue. (Modified from Schultze). the layer of ganglionic nerve cells (3). These cells are either bipolar or multipolar. In the living eye the cell substance is hyaline and the nucleus transparent, but after death the substance both of the body of the cell and the processes assumes a fibrillated appearance, like the axial cylinder of an optic nerve fibre. One process, the central process, extends into the layer of optic nerve fibres; and one or two branched peripheral processes into the internal molecular layer. The internal molecular or granulated layer (4) contains a reticulum of very fine fibrils, into which the branching processes of the nerve cells penetrate. The reticulum is partly nervous tissue and partly connective tissue. The internal granule or nuclear layer (5) contains

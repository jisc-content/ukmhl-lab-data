VISCERAL BRANCHES OF THE AORTA. 427 coronary artery, which again anastomoses with the gastric branch of the same artery. This gastric branch anasto- moses along the lesser curvature of the stomach with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. Along the greater curva- ture the left gastro-epiploic of the splenic anastomoses with the right gastro-epiploic of the gastro-duodenal branch of the hepatic, and in the walls of the stomach, branches from these arteries of the curvatures anastomose with each other and with the vasa brevia of the splenic. Along the curve of the duodenum, the superior pancreatico-duodenal of the gastro-duodenal of the hepatic anastomoses with the inferior pancreatico-duodenal of the superior mesenteric. The intestinal branches of the superior mesenteric anasto- mose not only with each other in the series of arterial arcades already described, but with the inferior pancreatico- duodenal and ileo-colic branches of the same artery. In the large intestine the ileo-colic anastomoses with the right colic, and the right colic with the middle colic branch of the superior mesenteric. The middle colic anastomoses with the left colic of the inferior mesenteric, the left colic with the sigmoid, and the sigmoid with the superior hoamorrhoidal artery. The superior hasmorrhoidal anasto- moses in the coats of the rectum, near its lower end, with the middle hemorrhoidal branch of the internal iliac and the inferior hemorrhoidal branch of the pudic. Through this chain of anastomoses, provision is made for equalizing the distribution of blood to the coats of the several divi- sions of the alimentary canal, and of providing secondary channels for the conveyance of blood to any division, in the event of the proper artery for that part being ob- structed,â€”a point of great importance in connection with

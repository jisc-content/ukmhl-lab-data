ANATOMY. 744 into distinct lobules by Bepta of connective tissue. Tbe excretory duct, or duct of Wirtmg, is completely sur- rounded by the lobules, and extends from the tail to the head of the gland, receiving in its passage the numerous secondary ducts, and increasing gradually in size. It leaves the head of the gland, comes into relation with the common bile duct, and with it pierces obliquely the posterior wall of the descending part of the duodenum, to open by a common orifice about the junction of the descending and transverse portions. Sometimes the duct from the accessory part of the pancreas opens indepen- dently into the duodenum, a little above the common hepatico-pancreatic orifice. The finest ducts within the gland terminate in the acini, or gland vesicles of the lobules. These acini contain the secretiug cells, which have a somewhat cubical form. Minute channels or inter- cellular passages have been described by Saviotti, be- tween the secreting cells, similar to those already referred to in the acini of the salivary glands. The ducts are lined by a columnar epithelium, and mucous glands are situated in the mucous membrane lining the duct of Wirsung. The pancreas receives its supply of blood from the pancreatic branches of the splenic artery, the inferior pancreatico-duodenal of the superior mesenteric, and the superior pancreatico-duodenal of the gastro-duodeual of the hepatic. Its veins join the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, and through them contribute to the for- mation of the portal vein. Its blood capillaries are abundantly distributed on the walls of the gland vesicles. Lymph vessels are found in the connective tissue between the lobules. The nerves are derived from the solar

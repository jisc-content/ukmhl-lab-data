ANATOMY. 702 during distension of the gut. The folds are placed trans- versely to the long axis of the bowel, and run around its inner wall for one-third or one-half, or two-thirds of its cir- cumference (fig. 185). They project into the lumen of the intestine, and the largest are about one-third of an inch in depth. They are first seen about the commencement of the descending part of the duodenum, are very numerous in the transverse part of the duodenum and upper half of jejunum, then decrease in size and numbers, until at the lower end of the ileum they have disappeared. Each valvula consists of a fold of the mucous membrane with its submucous coat. Owing to their presence, the extent of the mucous surface is much greater than if it were a plane-surfaced membrane. In its more minute structure the mucous coat may be regarded as composed of projecting bodies, a glandular layer, and a muscular layer. The projecting bodies are the intestinal Villi, which jut out into the lumen of the intestine from the free surface of the mucous membrane, not only of the valvulae, but of the intermediate surface. They are delicate minute pro- cesses, varying in length from a fourth to half a line, and in number amount to several millions. They are best examined when the mucous surface is placed in water or spirit, when they may be seen with the naked eye, or still better, with a pocket lens; when the chyle-vessels or blood-vessels are injected, they become erected, and stand out more prominently from the surface. They vary in form, being filiform, or cylindrical, or conical, or club-shaped,. or leaf-shaped. They are more numerous in the duodenum and jejunum than in the

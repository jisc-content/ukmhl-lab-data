VISCERAL BRANCHES OF THE AORTA. 421 is separated from the anterior abdominal wall by the stomach, pancreas, transverse colon, transverse part of duodenum, mesentery, and coils of small intestine : the splenic artery, and the splenic and left renal veins are also in relation to its anterior surface. It is to a great extent surrounded by the aortic nervous plexus of the sympathetic. The inferior vena cava, greater azygos vein, and thoracic duct are in contact with its right side. Lymphatics, veins and glands lie on the spinal column in close relation to it. The aorta gives direct origin to numerous branches, which may be arranged in four groups.—1st, Branches for the supply of the viscera of the thorax and abdomen proper; 2d, branches for the walls of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis ; 3d, branches for the head, neck, and upper limbs ; 4th, branches for the lower limbs, pelvic walls and viscera. FIRST GROUP.—VISCERAL BRANCHES OF THE AORTA. The branches of the aorta which supply the viscera may be arranged in two groups,—those which pass to the thoracic viscera, and those which pass to the viscera of the abdomen proper. 17 The branches of the aorta which supply the Viscera of the Thorax are the coronary, the oesophageal, the bronchial, and the pericardial arteries. The Coronary arteries, two in number, are the first branches of the arch of the aorta, and arise, opposite the right and left antero-lateral segments of the semilunar valve, from the wall of the aorta, where it dilates into the sinuses of Valsalva. The right coronary artery runs in

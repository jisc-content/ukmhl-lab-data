INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 289 3d or large ■pyramidal-cell layer contains, along with the smaller pyramidal cells, pyramidal cells two or three times larger than those in the 2d layer, and more widely separated from each other (fig. 93). The 4th or granular layer con- tains small elliptical or angular cells, giving off branches from their sides ; they appear like transversely divided pyra- midal cells. The 5th or claustral layer contains fusi- form cells, which give off lateral processes. Nerve fibres radiate from the white core of the convolutions into the several layers of grey matter. They are arranged in bundles in the 5th, 4th, and 3d layers, and are more scattered in the 2d and 1st. They have apparently a double connection with the pyramidal nerve cells, partly with the central process from the base of each cell, and partly with the fine network of fibres formed by the branching and anastomosing of the protoplasm processes (p. 198). Special modifications in structure occur in several of the convolutions. Betz has described in the ascending frontal convolution and in the paracentral lobule clusters of from two to seven giant pyramidal cells, about three times larger than the large pyramidal cells of the 3d layer. They are Fig. 93.—Vertical Section through the 3d layer of grey matter of the Superior Frontal Convolution. Larger - sized pyramidal nerve cells; the neuroglia, with its corpuscles and some capillary blood-vessels, are represented.

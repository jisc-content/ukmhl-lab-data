At the one border, they are continuous with the vasculo-pigmentary structures of the choroid; at the other, with the vasculo- pigmentary structures of the iris. The ciliary muscle is the greyish-white structure which forms the outer part of the ciliary body. It was at one time called the ciliary ligament, but its muscular nature was discovered almost simultaneously by Bowman and Briicke. It consists of smooth involuntary muscle, the fibres of which are arranged in two layers. The outer and thicker part of the muscle consists of fasciculi, which arise from the ligamentum pectinatum, opposite the junction of the sclerotic and cornea, and radiate from before backwards in the meridian of the eyeball, between the ciliary processes and the sclerotic. The inner part of the muscle forms a ring-like arrangement of fasciculi close to the circumference of the iris, and is often called the annular muscle of Muller. Iwanoff has shown that in long-sighted persons (hyperme- tropic) the annular muscle is strongly developed; whilst in short sighted (myopic) eyes its fasciculi are very feeble. The Ciliary Processes have on their inner surface a black pigmentary layer of cells or uvea. The vitreous layer is also present, but according to H. Muller is no longer smooth but reticulated. The stroma does not contain so large a proportion of stellate pigment cells as the choroid. The arteries are the long posterior ciliary branches of the ophthalmic, and the anterior ciliary of the muscular branches of the ophthalmic. They pierce the sclerotic, run forwards, and at the anterior border of the ciliary muscle form by their anastomoses the circulus arteriosus, which gives origin to the arteries for the ciliary processes and the iris. The arteries for the ciliary processes are short, and divide into

PERITONEUM. 683 This so-called foramen is not a hole, or break in the conti- nuity of the peritoneal membrane, but a constricted passage, situated behind the right free border of the small omentum, where the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct are ascending to the trausverse fissure of the liver. The passage Fig. 183.â€”Diagram of a transverse section through the Abdomen and Peritoneum in the region of the lesser cavity of the peritoneum and of the Foramen of Winslow, s, stomach; sp, spleen. The stomach and spleen are attached together by the gastro-splenic omentum, sr, sr, supra-renal capsules; tf, dia- phragm ; a, aorta; i, inferior vena cava; o, small omentum, with the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct, transversely divided; p, lesser cavity of peritoneum; P, the greater cavity of peritoneum, the letter being placed in the position of the liver. The arrow is placed in the foramen of Winslow. is bounded posteriorly by the peritoneal membrane covering the inferior vena cava; above it is bounded by the Spigelian lobe of the liver, and below by the duodenum. Through it not only does the greater cavity of the peritoneum com municate with the lesser, but the membrane lining the greater is continuous with that of the lesser cavity. The foramen is sufficiently large to admit of the passage of two fingers, and through their agency the extent of the lesser cavity may be examined. But a fuller view of this cavity may be obtained by detaching the great omentum from the greater curvature of the stomach and then drawing the stomach forwards. The prolongation of the lesser

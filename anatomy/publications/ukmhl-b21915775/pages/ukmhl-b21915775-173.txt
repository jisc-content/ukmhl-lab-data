157 CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. more or less perfect structure. In the lamprey and myxine it forms a continuous rod in the vertebral region. In fish generally, and in the cartilaginous fish especially, it is a jelly-like mass, occupying the concavities between the bodies of the vertebrae. The notochord is at first a solid cord of cells around which a sheath forms. The cells are comparatively large and ovoid or polygonal. The nucleus is often very distinct, though at other times more difficult to detect, and the cell wall is well marked. Subsequently vacuoles form in the cells of the notochord, which enlarge until the chorda becomes formed of large vacuoles separated by membranous septa, which form a reticulum filled with gelatinous material (F. M. Balfour). G. Retzius states that the tissue of the chorda does not contain chondrine. The Hyaline Cartilage consists of cells imbedded in a pellucid or hyaline matrix, which, under some conditions, however, may assume a dimly granulated appearance. The xiphoid and costal cartilages, the encrusting cartilages at the articular ends of the bones, the cartilages of the nose, those of the windpipe, except the epi- glottis and cornicula laryngis, belong to this variety, as also the temporary cartilages. In FlG‘49-—Hyallne Costal Cartilage, hyaline cartilage the cells are ovoid or polygonal, or even fusiform, and sometimes flattened, the flattened form of cell being found next the surface of the cartilage. They lie singly, or in groups of two, or three, or four; sometimes they are arranged in linear series, at other times they are irregularly grouped together. The cell proto- plasm is granular and contains a network of minute

259 THE BRAINâ€”CEREBELLUM. layer. The body of each cell lies close to the junction of the cellular and rust-coloured layers with each other, and the slender central process arising from each cell enters the rust-coloured; layer, and, as the observations of Hadlich and Koschennikoff show, becomes continuous with the axial cylinder of a medullated nerve fibre; for the nerve fibres of the white core enter this layer, divide into minute fibres, and ramify amidst the granules. From the opposite aspect of each cell two peripheral processes arise, and ramify in an antler-like manner in the external grey layer. Obersteiner and Hadlich maintain that the finer branches of these processes curve back towards the rust-coloured layer, where, according to Boll, they form a network of extreme minuteness, from which it is believed that nerve fibres may arise. The substratum of the grey layer, in which the branched processes of the cells of Purkinje lie, consists of a very delicate neuroglia, in which scattered corpuscles are imbedded; but, in the outer part of this layer, delicate supporting connective tissue-like fibres are also met with. The blood-vessels of the investing pia mater pass into the cellular layer of grey matter and form in it a rich capillary plexus. Some pass through the cellular into the rust-coloured layer, where they also form a close capillary network, and from them smaller vessels are prolonged into the white core, the vascularity of which is comparatively feeble. The Cerebellum is both a conductor of nerve impulses and a nerve centre. Through the nerve fibres of its peduncles it is continuous with the other divisions of the encephalon, and with the spinal cord, and its nerve cells give origin both to peduncular fibres and to some roots apparently of the auditory and 5th cranial nerves. It seems to be the great nerve centre associated with the co-ordination of orderly muscular movements.

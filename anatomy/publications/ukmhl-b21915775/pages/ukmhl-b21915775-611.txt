The slit between the two true vocal cords and the inner surfaces of the two arytenoid cartilages, is in the mesial plane, and is named the rima glottidis, or chink. of the larynx. That part of the rima which lies between the vocal cords has been called the vocal glottis, whilst that situated between the arytenoid cartilages is the re- spiratory glottis (fig. 166). The long or antero-posterior diameter of the rima is nearly 1 inch in the larynx of a man, and about f-inch in that of a woman. Its width or transverse diameter varies with the position of the vocal cords, and the variations in its width modify its shape. When the cords are separated to the greatest extent, the rima is lozenge-shaped ; when they are moderately asunder, it is an elongated triangle, with the base behind and the apex in front; when they are brought in contact with each other the rima is closed. Between the superior and inferior vocal cord on each side is an elongated deep depression, the sinus, or ventricle of the larynx, which is lined by mucous membrane; the floor of this ventricle is concave immediately to the outer side of the true vocal cord. A prolongation of the ventricle, named the pouch of Morgagni or saccule of the larynx, passes upwards, to the outer side of the superior vocal cord, as high as the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage; the pouch is lined by mucous membrane con- tinuous with the mucous lining of the ventricle of the larynx, and in its outer wall is the thyro-arytenoid muscle. If a vertical transverse section be made through the larynx immediately in front of the arytenoid cartilages the

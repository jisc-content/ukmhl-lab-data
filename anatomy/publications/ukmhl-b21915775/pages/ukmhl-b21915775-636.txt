620 ANATOMY. is continuous above with the cervical pleura, and below with the diaphragmatic pleura. Where the costal cartilages articulate with the sternum, the costal pleura comes in contact with the back of that bone, and is then reflected backwards, as the mediastinal pleura, on the outside of the pericardium, from which it is prolonged in front of the root of the lung to become continuous with the pulmonic pleura. Where the ribs articulate behind with the spine, the pleura is prolonged on the sides of the vertebral bodies, from which the right pleura is reflected forward on the back of the root of the lung, to become continuous with the pulmonic pleura; but the left pleura, before it reaches the back of the root of its lung, is prolonged over the left aspect of the descending thoracic aorta. The cervical prolongation of the pleura forms the dome-shaped summit of the parietal pleura. It corre- sponds to the apex of the lung, and is in relation by its outer surface to the scalenus anticus muscle and the sub- clavian artery. The parietal part of the right pleura is more extensive than that of the left, for not only does it pass behind the sternum up to the mesial line of that bone, or sometimes even to the left of that line ; but owing to the greater projection of the heart to the left than to the right of the mesial thoracic plane, it covers a larger proportion of the upper surface of the diaphragm. The costo-parietal part of the left pleura, again, whilst it reaches the left border of the upper part of the sternum, does not pass so far for- ward as the lower part of the body of tbnt bone. The costal pleura; do not reach quite so far down as the costal origins of the diaphragm, so that these origins, as well as

373 THE EAE. row of compressed conical cells, which possess at their anterior ends short stiff hair-like processes ; they are the inner hair cells of Deiters. Internal to these are elongated supporting cells continuous with those covering the crista spiralis. Immediately external and almost parallel to the outer group of rods of Corti are four, five, or even six rows of haired cells, the outer hair cells. Each consists of a deeper part attached to the basilar membrane, and of a Fig. 111.â€”Vertical transverse section through the Crista Spiralis, Basilar mem- brane anil organ of Corti. bm, cs, si, &c., as in fig. 109; i, inner hair cell; ir, inner, and or, outer rod of Corti; o, outer hair cells ; sp, supporting cells ; cn, cochlear nerve; cc, canal of Corti; rm, reticular membrane; ml, membrana tectoria, torn through at its outer end. (Adapted from Waldeyer.) superficial part from which a brush of hairs projects through the reticular membrane. The outer hair cells are, according to Waldeyer, relatively of large size in man. The reticular membrane of Kolliker is a delicate framework perforated by rounded holes. It extends parallel to the basilar membrane from the inner rods of Corti to beyond the external row of outer hair cells, and through the holes in it the hairs of the outer hair cells project. It obviously acts as a support for the anterior ends of these cells, and

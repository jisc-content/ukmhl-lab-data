24 ANATOMY. condyle is the jugal process, which is grooved superiorly for the lateral sinus, and has anteriorly the jugal notch for the internal jugular vein. The basi-occipital articulates and, in the adult skull, is fused with the body of the sphenoid (fig. 7). The upper surface of the basi-occipital is grooved for the lodgment of the medulla oblongata. Sometimes tlie part of the supra-occipital situated, above the pro- tuberance and upper curved line ossifies as au independent bone, called interparietal. In some mammals, as the sheep, the existence of an interparietal in the young skull is the rule and not the exception. The Sphenoid or Wedge-shaped bone (fig. 7) lies at the base of the skull; it articulates behind with the occipital; in front with the ethmoid and frontal; by its lateral pro- cesses or wings with the frontal, parietal, temporal, and malar bones; and below with the vomer and palate. It binds together all the bones of the cranium, articulates with five bones of the face, and for constructive purposes is the most important bone of the head. It consists of a centrum or body, with which four pairs of processes are connected. The body has a deep depression on its upper surface, compared in shape to a Turkish saddle, in which is lodged the pituitary body; hence it is called pituitary fossa. In front of this fossa is the olivary process, which marks the union of the pre- and post-sphenoidal subdivisions of the body of this bone ; the body is grooved laterally for the internal carotid artery and the cavernous blood sinuses; it is hollowed out in its interior to form the sphenoidal air-sinuses, which are partially closed in front by a pair of small bony plates, the sphenoidal spongy bones, or bones of Bertin. Behind the pituitary fossa is the pair of posterior clinoid processes from which the bone slopes back to the basi-occipital; this slope is called the dorsum sellas, and on it rests the pons Varolii.

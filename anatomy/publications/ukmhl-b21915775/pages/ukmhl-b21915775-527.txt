They are without valves; hut the superior longitudinal sinus has an irregular inner surf ace, owing to the projection of fibrous bands into its lumen. The Veins of the Brain ramify in the pia mater, and are arranged in a superficial and a deep group : The superficial veins of the cerebrum pass out of the convolutions into the pia mater covering the outer surface Fig. 138.â€”Dura mater and Cranial Sinuses. 1, Falx cerebri; 2, tentorium ; 3, 3, superior longitudinal sinus; 4, lateral sinus; 5, internal jugular vein; 6, occi- pital sinus; 6', tofcular Heropliili; 7, inferior longitudinal sinus; 8, veins of Galen; 9 and 10, superior and inferior petrosal sinuses; 11, cavernous sinus; 12, circular sinus, which connects the two cavernous sinuses together; 13, ophthal- mic vein from IS, the eyeball; 14, crista galli of ethmoid bone. and the inner face of the cerebral hemispheres, and open into the superior longitudinal sinus, though some of the veins of the inner face open into the inferior longitudinal sinus.

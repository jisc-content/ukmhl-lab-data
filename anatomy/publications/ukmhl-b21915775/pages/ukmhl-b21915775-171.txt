CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. 155 arranged to form a mosaic pattern. In the centre is a nucleus, and the cell substance is occupied by numbers of minute brown granules. In the connective tissue of the choroid itself the pigment is contained in stellate cells. In the skin of fishes and amphibia, the stellate pigment cells branch, and the branches divide so as to form highly complex patterns, and the cells are crowded with brown or yellow granules. The production of pigment, either in the interior of epidermal cells, in the polyhedral cells of the choroidal fig. 46.â€”stellate Pig- 1 J ment Cells from the surface of the retina, or in the stellate skin of a codfish. connective tissue corpuscles, is owing to a special meta- morphosis or differentiation of the protoplasm substance of these cells. Cartilaginous Tissue. By the term Cartilage, or cartilaginous tissue, is meant a group of tissues which, though usually found in the form of plates or bars, yet differ in various respects from each other, both in naked eye and microscopic characters. They agree, however, in forming solid textures, opaque when seen in mass, but translucent, pearly, or bluish white, in thin slices, firm in consistence, but easily cut with a knife, endowed with considerable elasticity, and yielding chondrine on boiling. Cartilage is of greater importance in the foetus, and in the immature condition of the body than in the adult, for in early life the skeleton is in a great measure formed of it. As development and growth proceed, a considerable proportion of the cartilage becomes converted into bone, and is called, therefore, temporary cartilage,

103 on the abdomen by the action of the psoas, iliacus, and JOINTS AND MUSCLESâ€”LOWER LIMB. ligament. The muscles which move the thigh at the hip joint are inserted either into the femur or fascia lata, and the great and small trochanters and linea aspera serve as their principal surfaces of attachment. The thigh is bent pectineus, which lie in front of the joint; it is extended or drawn into line with the trunk by the gluteus maximus and medius; it is abducted or drawn away from the opposite thigh by the gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus, which muscles are of large size, and form the fleshy mass of the buttock. It is adducted or drawn to touch its fellow, or, if slightly bent, drawn in front of its fellow, by the adductores longus, brevis, and magnus, which muscles are inserted into the linea aspera, and form the fleshy mass on the inner side of the thigh; and by the pectineus and quadratus femoris. The action in succession of these groups of muscles produces the movement of circumduction. It is rotated outwards by the obturatores and gemelli muscles, the gluteus maximus, pyriformis, and quadratus femoris; and rotated inwards by the gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae femoris. In standing erect the hip joints are fully extended, and the mechanical arrangements are such as to check disturbance of the equilibrium of the extended joint both in the antero-posterior and transverse directions. So long as the centre of gravity falls within the basis of support of the body, i.e., the space between the two feet when standing on both legs, the body will not fall. Dis- turbance of the equilibrium in the antero-posterior direction is checked by the weight of the body in the erect attitude falling behind the joints, so that the strong ilio-femoral bands of their capsular ligaments are made tense, and the body is prevented from falling backwards. If the body is

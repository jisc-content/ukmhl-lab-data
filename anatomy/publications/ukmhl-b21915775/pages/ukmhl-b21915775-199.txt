183 MUSCULAR TISSUE. sarcolemma is not present, and the muscle corpuscles lie in the substance of the fibre. Some difficulty has been experienced in determining the exact mode of connection of the fibres of the belly of a muscle with those of its terminal tendons. By some it has been supposed that the fibres of the muscle are directly continued into the connective tissue bundles of the tendon (fig. 62). Weismann again has described the muscular fibre as termin- ating in a sharply-defined, rounded, or pointed extremity, to which the fibres of the tendon are closely apposed, and Kanvier states that the sarcolemma is interposed be- tween the sarcous substance and the tendon. Both the striped and non-striped forms of muscle are well provided with blood- vessels, which ramify in the areolar connec- tive tissue, or perimysium, that separates the fasciculi and fibres from each other. The capillaries form an elongated network, the principal strands of which lie parallel to the r r L Fig. 62.—Blending muscular fibres, but never penetrate the of the bundles of * 1 fibnlhe of the sarcolemma. Hence, though the belly of muscular fibre of a muscle is a highly vascular organ, its tendon^c^om individual fibres are extra-vascular. But 27wi)' if Thin’s observations be correct, spaces in the interior of the muscular fibres are continuous with the lymphatic system. The vascularity of the fleshy belly is much greater than that of the terminal tendons of attachment, and the nutritive changes are much more active in it than in them. The mode of termination of nerves in muscle will be considered in the chapter on the nervous tissue.

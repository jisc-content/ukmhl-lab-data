333 THE EYEBALL. or tunica vasculosa, consists of the choroid, the ciliary processes, and the iris. The third or internal or nervous coat is named the retina, and in it the optic nerve ter- minates. The enclosed refracting media occupy the axis of the globe, and are named from before backwards, the aqueous humour, crystalline lens, and vitreous body. The External or Fibrcms Tunic. The Sclerotic coat, called from its white appearance the white of the eye, is a firm, unyielding fibrous membrane, which forms the posterior f-ths of the outer coat, and gives form to the eyeball. It is thicker behind than in front, and where pierced by the optic nerve it has a cribriform structure, as the bundles of nerve fibres do not pass through one large, but several small openings. Its inner surface is flocculent, and brown (lamina fusca) from contact with the choroid. The sclerotic consists of the white fibrous tissue, intermingled with a small proportion of elastic fibres. The bundles of white fibres lie in two directions; some pass in the meridian of the globe from the optic nerve towards the cornea, others lie parallel to its equator. The sclerotic is joined by accessory fibres behind, derived from the peri- neurium of the optic nerve, where the nerve pierces it; .and in front from the tendons of the recti and obliqui muscles, which are inserted into it. It is not very vascular. In the cetacea the sclerotic possesses extra- ordinary thickness. In fish and amphibia it consists largely of cartilage, andjin birds a ring of bone is developed around its anterior margin. The Cornea forms the translucent anterior ^th of the outer coat of the eyeball. It is almost circular in form, and is blended at its circumference with the anterior border

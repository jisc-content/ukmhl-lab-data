ANATOMY. 350 eyeball along with the bundles of the optic nerve through the lamina cribrosa in the sclerotic. The Optic Nerve itself passes from the orbit through the optic foramen into the cranial cavity, where it arises from the optic, chiasma or commissure. This commissure is a flattened band formed by the junction of the two optic tracts. Each tract winds backwards at the outer side of the tuber cinereum and crus cerebri, and divides posteriorly into three roots : the primary root goes to the corpus geni- culatum externum and optic thalamus; a second goes over the surface of the corpus geniculatum internum to the corpora quadrigemina; the third gives an offshoot to the corpus subthalamicum, but is mainly prolonged through the pons and medulla to the decussation of the pyramids and spinal cord (Stilling). This nerve arises primarily from the thalamencephalon, and secondarily from the middle and posterior cerebral vesicles. Ferrier localises the cerebral centre for visual perception in the angular gyrus, but Munk places it in the occipital lobe, from which fibres are regarded as passing into the optic thalamus, corpora quadrigemina, and geniculata. In the commissure an interchange takes place between the fibres of opposite nerves and tracts, so that an optic nerve contains fibres derived from the tract on its own side as well as from the opposite tract; and it even has been stated that fibres pass across the commissure from one optic nerve to the other nerve, and from one optic tract to the other tract. The Refracting Media. The Aqueous Htimour is a limpid watery fluid, containing a little common salt in solution, which occupies the space between the cornea and the front of the crystalline lens. In this space the iris lies, and imperfectly divides it into

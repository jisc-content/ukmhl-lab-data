ANATOMY. 166 affords a satisfactory demonstration that they are, in a macerated and dry bone, not solid bodies but a minute system of spaces and anastomosing little canals; and that those which lie in the same Haversian system freely communicate with each other, and either directly or in- directly, with the Haversian canal which they surround. But a macerated and dried bone, such as one sees in museums and in articulated skeletons, is a bone which has been deprived of several soft tissues by the process of putrefaction, which tissues are of the utmost importance in the economy of the bone in the living animal. A living bone is a complex organ, and h a macerated bone is only the Fig. 53. â€” Longitudinal Section skeleton of a living bone.

The soft tissues of a bone are the periosteum and its prolongations, the marrow, the minute masses of nucleated protoplasm which occupy the lacunae of the bone, the blood and lymph vessels, and the nerves. The Periosteum is a strong fibrous membrane which invests and adheres to all the exterior of a bone, except where the encrusting cartilage is continuous with its articular end. It is divided into two layers: a firm external fibrous layer (fig. 54 SP), and a softer internal or deep layer (DP). The external layer consists of white and yellow fibres of connective tissue, amidst which numerous

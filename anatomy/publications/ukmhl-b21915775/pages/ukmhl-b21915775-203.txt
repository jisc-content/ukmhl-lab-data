187 NEKVOUS SYSTEM. peripheral or centrifugal nerve. When a nerve connects a peripheral end-organ with a centre, and, under the influence of a stimulus, conducts impulses from the end-organ to the centre, it is a periphero-central or centripetal nerve. Owing to the different directions in which impulses are conducted by nerves, the varying nature of their end-organs, and the structural and functional differentiation of the nerve centres, or portions of the nerve centres in which their centra] extremities terminate, nerves vary so in their functions, that a classification of the nerves, based upon their functional properties, has been proposed. Of the Centro-Peripheral nerves, those which end in, and conduct impulses to the muscles are motor nerves ; those which end in, and conduct impulses to the muscular coat of the blood- vessels are vaso-motor nerves; those which terminate in connection with, and conduct impulses to the secreting cells of a gland, are secretory nerves; whilst some physiologists have named nerves, which they believe to terminate in the tissues and to conduct impulses for the regulation of their nutrition, trophic nerves. It should be stated, however, that it is not yet absolutely determined that the cell elements of the tissues have special nerves terminating in connection with them, for the purpose of exercising a direct influence over their nutrition. Should these special nerves be non-existent, then the nutritive functions would be influenced solely by the vaso-motor nerves, which regulate the size of the blood-vessels and the amount of blood which flows through'a part in a given time. Certain nerves which conduct impulses, by virtue of which the functional activity of a part is arrested or diminished, are called inhibitory nerves. Of the Periphero-Central nerves, those which arise in the end-organs in the skin, and terminate in a

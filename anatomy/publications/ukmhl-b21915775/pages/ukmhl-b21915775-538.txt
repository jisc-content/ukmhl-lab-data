ANATOMY. 522 The Portal Venous System. The portal system of veins is supplementary to the system of the inferior vena cava, and is formed by the veins of the intestine, which correspond to the inferior and superior mesenteric branches of the abdominal aorta, and by veins corresponding to the branches of the coeliac axis which go to the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and gall bladder. It collects and conveys the blood from those viscera and from the several divisions of the intestinal tube (fig. 141). The Inferior Mesenteric vein arises, as the superior hemorrhoidal vein, from the hsemorrhoidal plexus of veins around the lower end of the rectum â€¢ it ascends behind the rectum, and is then joined by the sigmoid vein. In its further ascent the inferior mesenteric receives the left colic vein, and lies behind the peritoneum to the left of the inferior mesenteric artery; it then passes behind the pancreas and ends in the splenic vein. The Superior Mesenteric vein is formed by the junc- tion of the ileo-colic, right colic, and middle colic veins ; it receives the intestinal veins corresponding to the intestinal branches of the superior mesenteric artery and the right gastro-epiploic vein. It ascends in the mesentery to the right side of the superior mesenteric artery, goes in front of the duodenum, and behind the pancreas, to join the splenic vein and so form the portal venous trunk (fig. 141). The Splenic vein commences in the substance of the spleen, from which it emerges at the hilus in five or six divisions, which unite in the gastro-splenic omentum into a single vein. The splenic vein runs to the right along with the splenic artery and behind the pancreas, and joins

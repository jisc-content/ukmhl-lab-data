ANATOMY. 256 the uvula and tonsil on each side is called the furrowed band. The whole outer surface of the cerebellum possesses a characteristic foliated or laminated appearance, due to its subdivision into multitudes of thin plates or lamellae by numerous furrows. The cerebellum consists both of grey and white matter. The grey matter forms the exterior or cortex of the lamellae, and passes from one to the other across the bottom of the several furrows. The white matter forms a compact mass, much thicker in the interior of the hemisphere than in the vermiform process, and extends into the core of each lamella. When a vertical section is made through the organ, the prolongations of white matter branching off into the interior of the several lamellae give to the section an arborescent appearance, known by the fanciful name of arbor vitse (fig. 83). Inde- pendent masses of grey matter are found in the midst of the white matter. In the white matter of the hemisphere a little to the outer side of the median lobe is a zig-zag arrangement of grey matter, the corpus dentatum of the cerebellum, similar in appearance and structure to the corpus dentatum of the olive in the medulla oblongata; it encloses white fibres, which leave it at its inner and lower side. Immediately to the inner side of each corpus dentatum is a longitudinal wedge-shaped band of grey matter, the embolus ; to its inner side is a grey layer, the nucleus globosus. At the anterior end of the vermiform process and immediately behind the lingula, where it aids in the formation of the roof of the 4th ventricle, are two grey masses, named roof nuclei '(Stilling). In all these masses are multipolar nerve cells containing yellow pigment, which cells in the nucleus globosus and roof nuclei are

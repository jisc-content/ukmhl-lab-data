ANATOMY. 326 occurring in tlieir several localities; the peripheral ends of the sensory nerves pass into their substance, and the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre ends in their interior. The rods and cones of the retina, the organ of Corti in the cochlea, the olfactory cells of the nose, and the gustatory bodies in the tongue, are the end-organs belonging to their several organs of sense; the sensory nerve fibres which terminate in relation with them have not yet, however, been traced into actual continuity with their substance. A stimulus, whatever may be its nature, applied to any organ of sense can excite only that kind of sensation for the production of which the organ is subservient. Thus a stimulus applied to the eye, whether it be the natural stimulus of the waves of light, the mechanical stimulus of a blow, or an electric stimulus, can only excite the sensation of light. Stimuli applied to the ear can only excite the sensation of sound, and in like manner with the other senses. In studying the anatomy of the organs of sense the arrangeâ€™ment of numerous accessory structures, which assist either in conducting stimuli or in modifying their effects, the arrangement and structure of the peripheral end-organs, and the origin, course, and distribution of the sensory nerves, will have to be considered. The Nose. The Nose or organ of smell is a large cavity situated in the face, between the orbits, above the mouth, and below the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. It communicates by the anterior nares, or nostrils, with the external atmo- sphere, by the posterior nares with the pharynx, and through it with the larynx, trachea, and lungs. It is not only the organ of smell, but is the proper entrance to the respiratory

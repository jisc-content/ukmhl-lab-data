ANATOMY. 422 the auriculo-ventricular groove to the right border and posterior surface of the heart, and gives off branches to the right auricle and ventricle. A long branch descends in the posterior ventricular groove to supply the ventricles. The left coronary artery runs behind the pulmonary artery to the auriculo-ventricular groove, and then round the left border of the heart to its posterior surface. It supplies the left auricle and ventricle, and sends a long branch to the apes of the heart in the anterior ventricular groove. According to some observers, the months of the coronary arteries are covered by the opening outwards of the aortic valves during the ventricular contraction; whilst the elastic recoil of the aorta following that contraction would, it is said, not only close the aortic orifice, but drive the blood into the coronary arteries. As these arteries break up into branches in the muscular walls of the heart, a sudden turgescence of its walls would, according to Briicke and A. H. Garrod, result from the filling of these vessels, and be the cause of the dilatation of the ventricular cavities. Hyrtl and Ceradini have, however, raised important objec- tions to this theory; they more especially urge that the valves do not close the orifices of the coronary arteries during the ventricular contraction, and that the capacity of the ventricles is diminished and not increased by the filling of these arteries. The Bronchial arteries are two in number. They may arise from the descending thoracic aorta, either by a com- mon trunk, or independently; or the right bronchial may spring from the first aortic intercostal artery : one artery accompanies each bronchial tube, branches along with it, and supplies the tissues of the lung.

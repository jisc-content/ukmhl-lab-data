ANATOMY. vocal cords are transversely divided, and it will be seen, as was pointed out by J. Wyllie, that the interior of the larynx possesses the form of two wedge-shaped spaces (fig. 164). The upper wedge extends from the superior orifice of the larynx to the ventricles of the larynx: the lower wedge from the lower orifice of the larynx to the true vocal cords. Experiments made by Wyllie have shown that the glottis can be closed, during an inspiratory effort, not only by the action of the muscles which bring the true vocal cords into apposition with each other; but by the pressure of the column of air, in the upper wedge-shaped space of the larynx, on the concave floor of the ventricles, immediately external to the true vocal cords. Whilst closure of the glottis, during an expiratory effort may be occasioned by the pressure of the column of air in the lower wedge-shaped space, inflating the pouches of the larynx, and forcing the false vocal cords together. The larynx contains in its interior therefore two valves, one of which can control the entrance, the other the exit of air. Fig. 164.â€”Vertical transverse sec- tion through the Earynx.

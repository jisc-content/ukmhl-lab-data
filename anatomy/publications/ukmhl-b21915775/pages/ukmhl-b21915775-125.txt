JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. 109 form to 2d metatarsal, one from ecto-cuneiform to 3d and 4th metatarsals; hence the tarso-metatarsal joints have three synovial membranes. Inter-Metatarsal Joints.—Dorsal, plantar, and interos- seous ligaments connect the tarsal ends of the four outer metatarsals ; a transverse metatarsal ligament connects the distal ends of all five metatarsals. The Metatarso- phalangeal and Inter-phalangeal Joints are constructed similarly to the corresponding joints in the hand. The toes are bent on the sole by a number of flexor muscles. Inserted into the ungual phalanges are the flexor longus digitorum, with its musculus accessorius, and the flexor longus hallucis. The flexor longus hallucis is the special flexor of the ungual phalanx of the great toe, but its tendon always gives a slip to the tendon of the flexor lougus digitorum, which slip goes, along with that tendon, sometimes to the 2d toe only, more frequently to the 2d and 3d, or even the 2d, 3d, and 4th, and rarely to the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th toes. Inserted into the 2d phalanges of the four outer toes is the flexor brevis digitorum the tendons of which are pierced by those of the flexor longus. Inserted into the 1st phalanx of the great toe is the flexor brevis hallucis, into that of the 5th toe the flexor brevis minimi digiti, whilst the lumbricales, as in the hand, are inserted into the extensor tendons. The ungual phalanx of the great toe is extended by the extensor longus hallucis \ its proximal phalanx by the inner division of the extensor brevis digito- rum, which is therefore an extensorprimi internodii hallucis. The four outer toes are extended by the extensor longus digi- torum, and in addition the extensor brevis gives tendons to the 2d, 3d, and 4th, but not the 5th, toes to be inserted with the longus into the 2d and 3d phalanges. The great toe

SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. 321 the common carotid artery, receives branches from the superior cervical ganglion, e, Cardiac branches from the superior, middle, and inferior cervical and the 1st thoracic ganglia, which pass to join the prevertebral cardiac plexus in the thorax. /, Splanchnic branches as follows :â€”great splanchnic nerve, by the union of branches from the thoracic ganglia, the 3d to the 10th inclusive ; it pierces the crus of the diaphragm, and joins the semilunar ganglion in the prevertebral solar plexus; small splanchnic nerve, also to the solar plexus from the 10th or 11th thoracic ganglia; smallest splanchnic nerve, from the 12th thoracic ganglion to the renal plexus, g, Hypogastric branches, from the lumbar and sacral ganglia to the prevertebral hypogastric plexus. The Prevertebral Cardiac plexus is situated at the base of the heart, and is divided into a superficial part, which lies in the concavity of the arch of the aorta, and a deep part between the aorta and trachea. It receives the cardiac branches of the pneumogastric and the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. It contains collections of nerve cells and a dense plexiform arrangement of nerve fibres. It gives off branches to the heart, which wind around the surface of that orgau and penetrate its muscular substance : on these branches minute ganglia are found which regulate its rhythmical movements. Through these branches and the cardiac plexus the heart is brought into connection with both the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems of nerves. The sympathetic apparently regulates its contraction, for when this nerve is stimulated the action of the heart is accelerated. The pneumogastric again exercises an inhibi- tory or restraining influence on the contraction of the organ, for when this nerve is irritated the activity of contraction is diminished, but when divided it is greatly increased. x

ANATOMY. 280 the genu and rostrum and form at the anterior perforated spots, the peduncles of tlie corpus callosum. In the middle line itself is a shallow longitudinal furrow, the raphe. If the corpus callosum he now cut through ou each side of its mesial line, the lateral, or 1st and 2nd ventricles will be opened into. Each Lateral Ventricle (fig. 90) forms a large cavity in its hemisphere, and is the greatly dilated ?axial canal of the prosencephalon (p. 209). It is divided into a central space or body, and three curved prolongations, the anterior, posterior, and descending cornua. The roof of the body of the ventricle is formed by the under surface of the corpus callosum. On its floor is situated, most anteriorly, a pear- shaped mass, the corpus striatum, the anterior end of which is thick and rounded, but it becomes attenuated behind into a tail-like prolongation. The surface of this body is formed of grey matter, the nucleus caudatus. Behind and internal to the corpus striatum is a small portion of the upper surface of the optic thalamus. Between the corpus striatum and optic thalamus is a band of white nervous matter, the taenia semicircularis, which appears in front near the anterior pillar of the fornix and runs back- wards and outwards to the descending cornu. This taenia is the upper edge of the inner capsule of the corpus striatum. On the upper surface of the optic thalamus is the vascular fringe of the velum interpositum, or choroid plexus, which appears to lie in the ventricular cavity, but is actually separated from it by an investing layer of epithelium (p. 209). Immediately internal to the choroid plexus is the free edge of the body and posterior pillar of the fornix, and the posterior pillar curves outwards to the hippocampus major. The anterior cornu extends forwards and outwards into

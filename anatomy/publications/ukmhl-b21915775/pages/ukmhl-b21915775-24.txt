CHAPTER I. SKELETON. Osseous System—Osteology—Skeleton.—The word Skeleton (from o-KeXXxo, to dry) signifies literally the dry or hard parts of the body. When used in a limited sense it is applied merely to the bones, but when used in a wider and more philosophic sense it comprises not only the bones or osseous skeleton, but the cartilages and fibrous membranes which complete the framework of the body. The first evidence of a skeleton in the embryo is the appearance of membranes in many parts of which cartilage is developed, and in course of time this cartilage is converted into bone. In some animals, however, as in the cartilaginous fish, the osseous conversion does not take place, and the skeleton remains permanently cartilaginous ; in the very remarkable fish called Lancelet, or Ampliioxm, the skeleton consists almost entirely of fibrous membrane. The skeleton serves as a basis of support for the soft parts, as affording surfaces of attachment for muscles and as a protection for many delicate organs. In the vertebx-ata the osseous skeleton is clothed by the muscles and skin, and is technically called an endo-sJceleton. In invertebrata (e.g., the Crustacea) the skeleton is usually on the surface of the body, and is termed an exo- or dermo-skeleton. In some vertebrates (e.gthe armadillo, tortoise, and sturgeon),

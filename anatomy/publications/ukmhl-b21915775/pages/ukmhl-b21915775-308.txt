ANATOMY. 292 campus ] each granule consists of a well-defined nucleus invested by delicate branched protoplasm. The grey matter of the septum lucidum was originally continuous with the cortex of the inner surface of the hemispheres, and contains both small pyramidal and fusi- form cells. The grey matter of the locus perforatus anticus contains clusters of minute granules and a compact arrange- ment of small nerve cells. b, The ganglia at the base of the cerebrum are, on each side, the corpus striatum, the optic thalamus, the corpus geniculatum externum, and the corpus subthalamicum. The Corpus Striatum consists of two masses of grey matter separated from each other by the white peduncular fibres of the inner capsule, which pass upwards through its substance. The upper mass projects into the lateral ventricle, and is called the intra-ventricular portion or nucleus caudatus. The lower extra-ventricular portion or nucleus lenticularis forms the outer and lower part of the corpus striatum : it is bounded above by the inner capsule, externally by the external capsule of white matter, which separates it from the claustrum, whilst below it is in relation with the locus perforatus anticus. The fibres of the internal capsule traverse both these grey nuclei and give them a striated appearance. Multipolar nerve cells are found in both the caudate and lenticular masses, and in the latter cells of large size have been seen. The Optic Thalamus consists largely of grey matter, arranged in three masses, the anterior, inner, and order nuclei, which are imperfectly separated from each other by a thin layer of white matter. The nerve cells in the grey matter are both stellate and fusiform. The Corpus Geniculatum externum consists of grey matter mingled with the nerve fibres of the optic tract.

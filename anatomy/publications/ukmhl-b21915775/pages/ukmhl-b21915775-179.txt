OSSEOUS TISSUE. 163 tissue are continuous with the inner surface of the compact tissue. Iu the long bones the interior of the shaft is hollowed into a canal, named the medullary canal, the walls of which are formed by the compact tissue, and the cancellated tissue is found only at the articular ends of these bones; the thickness of the compact tissue in a long bone is always greater at the centre of the shaft, but diminishes towards the articular ends. If we examine with a pocket lens the outer surface of the compact tissue and the wall of the medullary canal in a macerated long bone, multitudes of minute orifices will be seen, which are the mouths of minute tubular passages or canals that traverse the compact tissue. These passages are named Haversian canals, and their arrangement may be studied by making thin sections through the compact tissue, and submitting these to microscopic examination, when they will be seen to pass longitudinally or very obliquely through its substance, so as to terminate by rounded orifices both on the outer surface, and on the inner surface which forms the wall of the medullary canal. These canals are connected together at intervals by short transverse or oblique canals. Owing to these communica- tions the dense osseous tissue is permeated by an anasto- mosing network of Haversian canals, which, as they contain blood-vessels, are vascular canals. These canals are circular in transverse section, and vary in diameter from about -jj-jj^th to xwffth inch. They not unfrequently are dilated at the inner end, which opens into the medullary canal or the spaces of the cancellated tissue. In the compact tissue of all bones is a system of Haversian canals similar to those found in the long bones, but when bone occurs in the form of very thin plates these canals may be absent.

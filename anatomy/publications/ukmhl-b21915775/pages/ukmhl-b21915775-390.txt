374 ANATOMY. binds together these important elements of the organ of Corti. The interval between the outer hair cells and the spiral ligament is occupied by cells of a more or less columnar form, the supporting cells of Hensen. Covering over the organ of Corti, and separating it from the endolymph of the ductus chochlearis, is the membrana tectoria, which springs from the crista spiralis close to the attachment of the membrane of Reissner, passes outwards superficial to the membrana reticularis, and apparently blends at its outer border with the outer hair cells. The Auditory Nerve is the portio mollis of the 7th cranial nerve. It appears at the lower border of the pons Yarolii immediately external to the facial nerve. It has a posterior and an anterior root. The posterior winds round the restiform body to the floor of the 4th ventricle, as the strife acusticm, and sinks into the grey matter of the floor to arise from the inner nucleus acusticus and from the for- matio reticularis. The anterior root is connected with the restiform body, and probably with the flocculus of the cerebellum, and with the outer nucleus acusticus on the floor of the 4th ventricle. Just as the nerve emerges at the lower border of the pons, as may be well seen in pre- parations by A. B. Stirling, collections of very vascular grey matter containing groups of multipolar nerve cells lie between the bundles of the nerve, and from their processes re-inforcing fibres are added to the nerve. The auditory nerve passes down the internal meatus, and divides into a vestibular and a cochlear division. The vestibular division enters the vestibule, and divides into five branches for the sacculus, utriculuB, and three ampullae of the membranous semicircular canals. Each branch enters a crista acustica and forms a plexus, in the meshes of which nerve cells are imbedded. From this plexus fine non-medullated fibres

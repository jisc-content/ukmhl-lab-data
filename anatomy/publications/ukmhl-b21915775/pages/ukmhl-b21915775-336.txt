ANATOMY. 320 follows :â€”a, Pharyngeal branches from the superior cervical ganglion, which join the pharyngeal branches of the glosso- pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves, to form the pharyn- geal plexus, which supplies the muscles and mucous mem- brane of the pharynx, b, Articular branches from the upper thoracic and the lumbar ganglia to the articulations between the adjacent vertebras, c, Pulmonary branches from the 3d or 4th thoracic ganglia, which join the posterior pulmonary plexus, d, Vaso-motor branches or nervi molles, which supply the muscular coat of the arteries : those which arise from the cranial prolongation of the superior cervical ganglion supply the internal carotid artery and its branches to the brain and eyeball: those which arise from the superior cervical ganglion itself supply the ^external carotid artery and its branches; from the branch accompanying the facial artery the submaxillary ganglion derives its sympathetic root; from that accom- panying the middle meningeal artery the otic ganglion derives its sympathetic root: the vaso-motor nerves which arise from the middle cervical ganglion supply the inferior thyroid artery, and pass to the thyroid gland : the vaso- motor branches of the inferior cervical ganglion supply the vertebral and basilar arteries and their several branches, which pass to the spinal cord and the hinder part of the encephalon. Vaso-motor nerves also arise from the thoracic ganglia, which pass to the thoracic aorta, from the lumbar ganglia to the abdominal aorta, and from the sacral ganglia to the middle sacral artery; the ganglion irnpar gives branches to a peculiar vascular structure, named the ' coccygeal body, developed in connexion with the end of the middle sacral artery; a body of similar structure, called intercarotic body, situated in the angle of bifurcation of

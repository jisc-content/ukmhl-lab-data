391 THE SKIN. outer root-sheath. These glands secrete a fatty material, which lubricates the surface of the hair. One or two bundles of involuntary smooth muscular fibres extend from the deep surface of the cutis to be inserted into the lower third of the outer layer of the wall of the hair follicle (Kolliker). These muscles, named arrectores pili, by their contraction erect the hairs, that is, cause them to become more prominent, and produce the condition of skin called cutis anserina or goose skin, well known to occur when cold is applied to the surface of the body. Sweat Glands, or sudoriparous glands, are found generally distributed throughout the skin, but are most abundant in the palms and soles, where they number 2500 to 3000 in each square inch. In the skin of the back, again, there are only between 400 and 500 in the square inch. Each gland consists of a ball-like body lying in the subcutaneous tissue, from which a tubular duct proceeds through the skin to open on its free surface (fig. 114). The ball is composed of a convoluted tube continuous with the tubular duct, and terminating in a blind end. The wall of the gland tube consists of a delicate nucleated membrane lined by short columnar secreting cells. External to this membrane is a layer of involuntary muscles consisting of short fusiform cells; and outside it, again, is an adventitia of connective tissue containing capillary blood-vessels and lymph-vessels. As the gland-duct pierces the cutis it passes between the papillae; in its course through the cuticle it pursues a spiral direction, and has its walls formed, not of a distinct membrane, but of the cuticle cells themselves. The epithelial lining of the duct is continuous with the cells of the rete Malpighii of the cuticle. The mouths of the sweat ducts, or sweat pores, open on the skin of the hand and

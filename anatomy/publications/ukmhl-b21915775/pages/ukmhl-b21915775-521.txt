When on a level with the upper border of the root of the right lung, the azygos vein arches forwards above the root and joins the superior cava. The left azygos, or azygos minor, is connected below with the left lumbar veins, or the left renal; it enters the thorax through the aortic opening in the diaphragm, ascends in front of the bodies of the lower five or six dorsal vertebrae, receives the correspond- ing intercostal veins, and runs behind the aorta to join the right azygos vein. Owing to the connection below of the azygos veins with the lumbar veins, the systems of the superior and inferior venae cavae are anatomically con- tinuous with each other (fig. 137). The azygos vein is provided with valves. The intercostal veins of the two or three upper spaces of the right side join to form the right superior intercostal vein, which opens into the right brachio-cephalic vein, though sometimes they join the azygos vein. The intercostal veins of the upper four or five spaces of the left side join to form the left superior intercostal vein, which usually opens into the left brachio-cephalic vein, though it may join the left azygos vein. The left bronchial vein ends in the left superior intercostal vein. The Brachio-cephalic or Innominate veins are two in number, a right and a left. Each is formed by the junction, opposite the inner end of the clavicle, of the subclavian and internal jugular vein of its own side. The right vein is short, and descends to the right of the arteria innominata as far as the sternal end of the first intercostal space, where it is joined by the left brachio-cephalic vein to form the superior cava. The left vein, much longer than the right, crosses obliquely 2 K

NERVOUS TISSUE. 189 found, sometimes in considerable quantities. This grey- colour is so characteristic, that it may be regarded as marking the position of a nerve centre. The nervous system possesses a characteristic form of tissue—the nervous tissue—which in part consists of fibres (Nerve Fibres), and in part of cells (Nerve Cells). The nerve cells are found in the grey matter—that is, in the nerve centres—and sometimes also in the peripheral end- organs. The nerve fibres constitute the nerves, enter into the nerve centres, and pass into the peripheral end-organs; they form the white matter. But in addition to the characteristic nervous tissue, the nervous system also contains a considerable quantity of connective tissue, numerous blood-vessels, and some lymph-vessels. Nerve Fibres.—Nerve fibres are of two kinds: a, the white, medullated, or dark-bordered fibres, which are the character- istic fibres of the cerebro-spinal nervous system, though they also sparingly occur in the sympathetic system ; b, the pale, non-medullated, or gelatinous nerve fibres, which are the characteristic fibres of the sympathetic nervous system, though they are also found in the cerebro-spinal system. Medullated Nerve Fibres.—To examine the structure of these fibres, a portion of a cerebro-spinal nerve may be selected. In the first place, it will be seen to be invested by a sheath of connective tissue, the 'perineurium, which gives off processes that pass into the nerve, and divide it into fasciculi or funiculi. Each fasciculus is in its turn composed of nerve fibres, which are separated from each other by delicate connective tissue, the endoneurium, pro- longed from the perineurium, in which the nutrient blood- vessels of the nerve ramify. The perineurial connective tissue investing a fasciculus, presents, when treated with

THE EYEBALL. 341 tortuous branches, which frequently anastomose, and form highly complex vascular plexuses, from which veins arise that join the venae vorticosae. Before the long ciliary arteries contribute to the formation of the arterial circle they send branches to the ciliary muscle, and recurrent branches to the anterior part of the choroid coat. The Iris is a circular, flattened disc-shaped diaphragm, situated behind the cornea, in front of the crystalline lens, and bathed by the aqueous humour. By its circumference or ciliary border, the iris is continuous with the ciliary pro- cesses, and is also connected by fibres, termed ligamentum pectinatum, with the posterior elastic lamina of the cornea and with the sclerotic. The iris is the structure which gives the characteristic colour to the eyeâ€”blue, grey, brown, hazel, as the case may be. It is perforated at, or immediately to the inner side of, its centre by a circular aperture, the pupil, the size of which is regulated by the contraction or relaxation of the muscular tissue of the iris. The iris has its anterior surface covered by a layer of cells continuous with the epithelium of the aqueous humour. This layer is continuous at the pupillary border with a thick layer of cells filled with black pigment granules, the uvea, which covers the posterior surface of the iris, and is continuous at its ciliary border with the pigmentary layer of the ciliary processes. The connective tissue stroma of the iris also contains stellate pigment cells. The variations in colour of the iris in different eyes depend upon the distribution and amount of the pigment in the uvea and the stellate cells : in dark-coloured eyes, both are filled with dark pigment granules ; whilst in light-coloured eyes the stellate cells of the stroma are either devoid of pigment or only faintly coloured. The iris contains numerous fasciculi of involuntary or non-striped muscular

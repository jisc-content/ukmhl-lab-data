743 PANCREAS. ( The Pancreas. The Pancreas is an elongated gland which lies in relation to the posterior wall of the abdomen, in front of the first lumbar vertebra, and extends obliquely from the right lumbar region through the epigastrium into the left hypochondriac region. It is from 6 to 8 inches long, and whilst its dilated right extremity, or head, occupies the horse-shoe curve of the duodenum, and is attached by areolar tissue to the descending and transverse portions, its attenuated left extremity, or tail, is in relation to the spleen. Anterior to the pancreas is the pyloric end of the stomach and a portion of the posterior surface of that organ, but between the stomach and pancreas is the lesser cavity of the peritoneum, and the anterior surface of the pancreas is covered by the layer of peritoneum, which forms the posterior boundary of that cavity. It is attached behind by areolar tissue to the crura of the diaphragm, the splenic and superior mesenteric vessels, the portal vein, the aorta, inferior vena cava, left kidney, and supra-renal capsule. A prolongation of the gland, named the accessory or lesser pancreas, usually surrounds the superior mesenteric artery at its origin. Structure.â€”The pancreas is one of the compound racemose glands, and resembles generally in structure the mucous and salivary glands of the mouth and the glands of Brunner (fig. 191). It is sometimes called the abdominal salivary gland, and its secretion flows into the duodenum, and assists in the process of chylifica- tion. It has a yellowish creamy colour, and is divided

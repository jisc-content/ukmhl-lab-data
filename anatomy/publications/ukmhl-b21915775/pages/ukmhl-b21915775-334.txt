ANATOMY. 318 The Sympathetic Nervous System. The Sympathetic Nervous System consists of a pair of gangliated cords, situated one on each side of the spinal column; of three great gangliated prevertebral plexuses situated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities; of numer- ous smaller ganglia lying more especially in relation with the thoracic and abdominal viscera; of multitudes of fine communicating and distributory nerves, which apparently possess sensory, motor, vaso-motor, secretory and inhibitory functions. Each Gangliated Cord of the sympathetic extends along the side of the spine from the base of the skull to the coccyx. In the neck it lies in front of the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae; in the thorax, upon the heads of the ribs; in the abdomen, on the sides of the vertebral bodies; and as it descends in front of the sacrum it approaches its fellow, so that in front of the coccyx the two are united in the single ganglion, the ganglion impar (fig. 77, c). Each cord consists of a number of ganglia united into a continuous chain by intermediate nerves. As a rule, the ganglia equal in number the vertebrae of the region. Thus, in the sacral region there are five ganglia, in the lumber five, and in the thorax twelve; but in the neck there are only three, named superior, middle, and inferior ; of these the superior is very large, lies opposite the 2d and 3d cervical vertebrae, and represents without doubt four smaller ganglia. From the superior cervical ganglion the cord is prolonged upwards by an ascending or cranial offshoot, through the carotid canal into the cranial cavity, and forms a plexus around the internal carotid artery, both in the carotid canal, named the carotid plexus,

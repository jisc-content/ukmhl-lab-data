AXIAL SKELETON—THOKAX. 17 the adult spine a series of convexo-concave curves are found, which are alternate and mutually dependent, and are associated with the erect attitude of man. In the human spine alone are the lumbar vertebrae prominently convex forward. A lateral curve, convex to the right, opposite the 3d, 4th, and 5th dorsal vertebrae, with com- pensatory curves convex to the left immediately above and below, is due apparently to the much greater use of the muscles of the right arm over those of the left, drawing the spine in that region somewhat to the right. In disease of the spine its natural curvatures are much increased, and the deformity known as humpback is produced. As the spine forms the central part of the axial skeleton, it acts as a column to support not only the weight of the body, but all that can be carried on the head, on the back, and by the upper limbs : by its transverse and spinous processes it gives attachment to numerous muscles, and the transverse processes of its dorsal vertebrae are also for articulation with the ribs. THOKAX. The Thorax, Fectus, or Chest is a cavity or enclosure the walls of which are formed in part of bone and of cartil- age. Its skeleton consists of the sternum in front, the twelve dorsal vertebrae behind, and the twelve ribs, with their corresponding cartilages, on each side (fig. 5, also p. 605). The Sternum or Breast Bone is an elongated bone which inclines downwards and forwards in the front wall of the chest. It consists of three parts—an upper, called manu- brium or pre-sternum; a middle, the body or meso-sternum;. and a lower, the ensiform process or xiphi-sternum. Its anterior and posterior surfaces are marked by transverse lines, which indicate the three parts of the bone and also the

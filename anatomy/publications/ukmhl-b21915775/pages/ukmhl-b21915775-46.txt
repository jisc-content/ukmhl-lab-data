30 ANATOMY. than those of the Cranium. They are, two superior maxillary, two palate, two malar, two nasal, two lachrymal, two inferior turbinal, a vomer, and an inferior maxilla. The Superior Maxilla?, or bones of the Upper Jaw (figs. 6 and 7), form the skeleton of a large part of the face, and of the walls of the cavities of the nose, mouth, and orbit; around them the other bones of the face are grouped. The facial surface of each bone has a rough malar process for articulation with the malar bone; in front of this is the infra-orbital foramen for the infra-orbital nerve and vessels, also the canine fossa and incisor fossa; behind are several small foramina for the transmission of nerves and vessels to the teeth in the upper jaw. The orbital surface is smooth, forms the floor of the orbit, possesses a canal in which the infra-orbital nerve and vessels run and articulates by its inner border with the ethmoid and lachrymal. The nasal surface forms a part of the outer wall and floor of the nostril, and presents a hole leading into a large hollow in the substance of the bone, called the antrum, or superior maxillary air-sinus : it articulates with the inferior turbinal and palate bones. The nasal and facial surfaces become continuous with each other at the anterior aperture of the nose, and from them a strong ascending process joins the frontal bone close to the glabella; this process articulates behind with the lachrymal and in front with the nasal bone. The palatal surface forms a part of the bony roof of the mouth, and presents in front a small hole (the incisive foramen) which communicates with the nose; in the sheep and many other mammals this hole is of large size. The palatal surface is bounded externally by a thick elevated border, in which are the sockets, or alveoli, for the fangs of the teeth ; this surface articulates internally by a

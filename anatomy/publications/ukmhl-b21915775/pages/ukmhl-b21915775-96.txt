80 ANATOMY. and crest upwards to the 5th, 6th, and 7th costal cartilages ; and the pyramidal muscles which pass from the front of the os pubis to be inserted into the linea alba. The entire arrangement with the adjunct of the fascia transversalis completes the antero-lateral walls of the great abdominal chamber, supports the viscera, and enables the muscles to compress the abdominal viscera, an action which takes place when the contents of the bowels and bladder are being expelled during defalcation and micturition. Bones and joints play a more important part in the formation of the walls of the thoracic than of the abdominal cavity. The twelve ribs on each side articulate behind with the twelve thoracic vertebrae, and by arching more or less completely forward, the seven upper ribs, through their costal cartilages, articulate with the sternum. Costo-central Joints connect the head of a rib and the body of one or usually two adjacent vertebrae : in the latter case, an inter articular ligament passes from the head of the rib to the intervertebral disc and divides the joint into two synovial cavities. Each joint is closed in anteriorly by a costo-central or stellate ligament. Costo-transverse Joints exist between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra except in the floating ribs. The joints are diarthrodial, and possess posterior, ascending, and intercosto-transverse ligaments. The Costo- sternal Joints are also diarthrodial (except the 1st costal cartilage, which is united by synchondrosis to the pre- sternum). The 2d costal cartilage to the 7th inclusive are connected to the sternum by capsular ligaments, and the lining synovial membrane is, except that of the 7th cartilage, divided by an interarticular band into two cavities. The cartilages of the 6th to the 9th ribs are also

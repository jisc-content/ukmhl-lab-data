381 THE TONGUE. pharyngeal is distributed to the mucous membrane of the dorsum of the root of the tongue, to the circumvallate papillae and the gustatory lamellae. In connection with its terminal branches, peculiar flask-shapecl organs, called gustatory bulbs or bodies, have been described by Lov4n, Schwalbe, and Engelmann, in the sides of the circumvallate papillae, and in the gustatory lamellae. When sections are made through one of these lamellae, or through a circum- vallate papilla and the trench which surrounds it, numerous flask-shaped gustatory bulbs may be seen in the epithelium, which covers the side of the lamella or of the papilla and the op- posite side of its trench. The bottom of each flask is next the sub-epithelial tissue, whilst its short neck opens on the surface by a mouth, the gustatory pore; similar bodies, though in much smaller numbers, have also been seen in the fungiform ou^Tatm-y Cbiiib °f g papillae. Each gustatory body consists of |^ite periphcmi.^nd two different forms of cells, named cover- c’lts central process- ing cells and gustatory cells. The outer covering cells are elongated, flattened, and nucleated ; arranged in layers, which form the envelope of each gustatory bulb, and reach from the bottom of the flask to its mouth; they enclose the gustatory cells. The inner gustatory cells occupy the axis of the gustatory bulb. They are homogeneous, highly retractile; and are attenuated either into delicate spindles or rods, and the peripheral end of the rod is sometimes forked. Each cell has an elliptical nucleated body with two processes, a central and peripheral. The peripheral process, broader than the central, sometimes ends in a short hair-like tip, which almost reaches the gustatory pore j the central process extends to the base of the flask Fig. 113.—s, superficial

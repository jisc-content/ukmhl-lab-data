76 ANATOMY. rib into three longitudinal columns. The external column or sacro-licmbalis ascends behind the angles of the ribs into which it is inserted, and from which it receives the musculus accessorius ; it is prolonged to the 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical transverse processes as the cervicalis ascendens. The middle column or longissimus clorsi ascends behind the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, into which it is inserted as well as into the ribs between their tubercles and angles ; it is prolonged to the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical transverse processes as the transversalis cervicis, and to the mastoid-temporal as the trachelo-mastoid. The inner column or spinalis dorsi ascends from the upper lumbar and lower dorsal spines to the higher dorsal spines. The muscles arranged obliquely are subdivided into two groups. In the one group the fibres pass obliquely from within upwards and outwards. These muscles are the obliquus inferior from the spine of the axis to the transverse process of the atlas; and the splenius, which, arising from the ligamentum nuchae, the 7th cervical spine, and the upper sis dorsal spines, and dividing into S. capitis and S. colli, is inserted partly into the mastoid-temporal and partly into the upper three cervical transverse processes. In the other group the fibres pass obliquely from without upwards and inivards. These muscles are the complexus arising from the seven highest dorsal transverse processes and the five lowest cervical articular processes, and inserted into the occiput between the two curved lines ; the obliquus superior from the transverse process of the atlas to the occiput external to the inferior curved line; and the great oblique rotator of the spine. This great oblique rotator muscle lies at the side of the vertebral laminae, and extends from the sacrum to the axis. It is composite, and divided into three

ANATOMY. 140 lymph and blood vessels and of the heart, the synovial membranes of joints, of synovial sheaths and bursae. The tubes, canals, and cavities lined by an endothelium are shut off from all communication with the external atmosphere. The cells of the endothelium are arranged so as to give perfect smoothness to the surface which they cover. In the blood and lymph vessels this smoothness of surface is in order to facilitate the flow of the blood and lymph in the course of the circulation. The serous and synovial membranes are found covering the surfaces of parts which move on each other, and the smoothness of their respective surfaces, by permitting freedom of movement, diminishes the friction. Endothelial cells form only a single layer of tessellated scales, cemented together by an albuminous substance,, which reduces nitrate of silver. The nuclei usually disappear; but when present they show an intra-nuclear network of fibrils, and the body of the cell an intra-cellular network (Klein). Endothelium, like epithelium, is non-vascular, and, so far as is known, non-nervous. The endothelial cells rest upon a sub-endothelial tissue, consisting of the fibrous variety of connective tissue. Here, as in the surfaces covered by epithelium, a base- ment membrane was at one time supposed to intervene between the cells and the connective tissue; but it is now believed that the cells are in direct contact, by their deeper surface, with the connective tissue itself, which serves as the framework of support for the blood and lymph vessels and the nerves of the part. In the serous membranes, and in the coats of the larger blood-vessels, elastic fibres are present in considerable numbers in the sub-endothelial tissue. In the serous membranes the lymph-vessels are

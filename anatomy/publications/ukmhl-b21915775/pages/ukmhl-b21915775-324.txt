An accessory portion, called portio intermedia, which is said to arise from the lateral columns of the cord, joins the portio dura The portio dura enters the internal auditory meatus in the petrous-temporal bone along with the auditory nerve; but at the bottom of the meatus it leaves that nerve and enters the aqueduct of Fallopius, along which it is conducted through the bone to emerge at the stylo-mastoid foramen. When in the aqueduct it forms a hiee-shaped bend, and expands into the geniculate ganglion, which is joined by the great, small, and external superficial petrosal nerves, and sends a twig to the vestibular branch of the auditory nerve. Through the external petrosal it communicates with the sympathetic and receives, probably from it, vaso- motor fibres 3 through the great petrosal, which subse- quently forms a part of the vidian nerve, it communicates with Meckel’s Ganglion on the 2nd division of the 5th nerve, and gives to that ganglion branches, which supply through it the levator palati and azygos uvulae muscles; through the small petrosal it communicates with the Otic Ganglion and with the tympanic plexus of the glosso- pharyngeal nerve, and receives, probably from the latter, branches which pass off in the chorda tympani as its taste branches. The portio dura also communicates with the auricular branch of the vagus, and freely with the 5th cranial nerve. The portio dura gives off in the aqueduct— a, a minute branch to the stapedius muscle: b, the chorda tympani. After it has passed through the stylo-mastoid foramen it gives off—c, the posterior auricular branch to the occipital belly of the occipito-frontalis and to the retrahens aurem muscle : d, the digastric branch to the

32 ANATOMY. the orbit, and fitting between the ethmoid, superior maxilla, and frontal bones. It has a groove on the outer surface, in which is lodged the lachrymal sac. The Nasal (fig. 6) is a thin, elongated bone, which, articulating with its fellow in the middle line and with the mes-ethmoid, forms the bony bridge of the nose; above, it articulates with the frontal, and by its outer border with the ascending process of the superior maxilla. The Malar bone (fig. 6), irregular in shape, forms the prominence of the cheek, and completes the outer wall of the orbit. It rests upon the superior maxilla; by its orbital plate it articulates with the ali-sphenoid; by its ascending process, with the external angular process of the frontal; by its posterior process with the zygomatic process of the temporal, so as to complete the zygomatic arch. It is pierced by one or more malar foramina. The Inferior Maxilla, Lower Jaw, or Mandible (figs. 6 and 7), a large horse-shoe shaped bone, has (the hyoid and tympanic ossicles excepted) the distinction of being the only movable bone of the head. It consists originally of two separate halves, which unite during the first year of life into a single bone at the symphysis or chin. A character- istic feature of the humau lower jaw is the forward slope at the chin, for in other mammals the symphysis inclines backwards. The bone consists of a body and two rami. In the upper border of the body are the sockets for the lower teeth. Its outer surface shows the incisor fossa, the mental foramen, and an oblique line for muscular attach- ment : its inner surface the genial tubercles, and the mylo- hoicl ridge. Posteriorly the bone ascends almost vertically, as the ascending ramus, and terminates in two processes separated by the sigmoid notch,â€”an anterior, or coronoid

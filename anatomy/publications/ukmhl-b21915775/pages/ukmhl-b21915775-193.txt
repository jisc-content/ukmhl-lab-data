177 MUSCULAR TISSUE. striped,'owing to’ the presence of fine fibrils. Opinions differ as to the existence of a cell wall or sarcolemma. In some localities, as was pointed out by Lister in the minute arteries in the web of the frog’s foot, isolated contractile fibro-cells are wound spirally around the wall of the vessel. The cell-substance refracts light doubly, i : The Transversely Striped fibre is the characteristic tissue of the voluntary muscular system, and is found wherever energetic movements are to be performed. In these muscles the fibres are collected together in fasciculi, and the bundles usually lie parallel to each other, and extend from the tendon of origin to the tendon of insertion. Each muscle is invested by a membranous sheath formed of con- nective tissue, the perimysium externum, which sheath gives off processes that dip into the substance of the muscle, so as to form delicate partitions between the fasciculi, and from these partitions still more slender prolongations of connective tissue, named ‘perimysium internum, pass between the fibres. The number and size of the fasciculi vary with the size and texture of the muscle ; in some, as the deltoid and gluteus maximus, the fasciculi are large and coarse; whilst in others, as the gracilis and omo- hyoid, they are much finer. The number of fibres in a fasciculus varies with its length and thickness, and the fibres which are contiguous with each other in the same fasciculus lie parallel. The striped fibres themselves are cylindrical or laterally compressed ; they usually taper off at their extremities, and apparently do not, even in muscles with long fasciculi, exceed 1| inch in length. The trans- verse diameter of the striped fibres varies, in different localities in the human body, from xu^-th to -gxiyu inch. Much wider differences in diameter are found in the animal M

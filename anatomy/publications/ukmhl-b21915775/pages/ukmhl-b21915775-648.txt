ANATOMY. 632 Structure of the Lungs and Bronchi. The Lung is composed of the ramifications of the bronchial tube, of its terminal apparatus the air-cells or pulmonary vesicles: of the branches of the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary capillaries, and pulmonary veins : of the ramifications of the bronchial artery and vein : of nerves and lymphatics. These several structures are bound together by connective tissue, and the entire organ is invested by the pulmonic pleura. The pulmonic pleura forms the external or serous coat of the lung. It closely envelopes the lobes of the lung, and gives to them a smooth, glistening surface. The free surface of the pulmonic pleura is covered by a single layer of endothelial cells. Klein has pointed out that whilst the endothelium covering the costal pleura consists of polygonal scales, like those of serous membranes generally, the cells of the pulmonic pleura are flattened only during inspiration : during expiration, again, they are polyhedral, or even columnar, their contents are distinctly granular, and the nucleus is more spherical in shape. The sub- endothelial tissue of the pulmonic pleura consists of bundles of white fibrous connective tissue intermingled with elastic fibres. Klein has shown that in some animals, more especially the guinea pig, bundles of non-striped muscular fibres form a network immediately beneath the sub-endothelial connective tissue.

375 THE EAR. â€¢arise, which enter the layer of cells on the surface of the crista, where they anastomose and form a very delicate plexus, from which fibres spring that in all probability join the central processes of the auditory cells (fig. 108). The cochlear division enters a canal in the axis of the modiolus, and gives off lateral branches, which pass into the canals situated in the osseous spiral lamina. Here they radiate outwards to the membranous spiral lamina, and have connected with them collections of nerve cells forming the spiral ganglion. Beyond the ganglion they form a flat plexiform expansion, from which non-medullated fibres pass through a gap in the edge of the osseous lamina into the organ of Corti. In this organ the nerves, as Gottstein and Waldeyer have described, are arranged in two groups of fibres : the inner group become continuous with the deep end of the inner hair cells; the outer group pass across the canal of Corti and end in the outer hair cells (fig. 111). Hence these cells are the peripheral end- organs of the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve, and may be called the auditory cells of the cochlea. The perilymph of the labyrinth is set in vibration by the movements of the tympanic ossicles and the fenestra ovalis : motion is thus communicated to the membranous labyrinth and the endolymph which it contains. The auditory hairs and cells would thus be set in motion, and the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve would be stimulated to conduct sound-impulses to the brain. The movements of the perilymph in the scala tympani, and of the endolymph in the ductus cochlearis, would set in vibration the basilar membrane and the auditory cells rest- ing on it, through which the cochlear branches of the audi- tory nerve would be stimulated to conduct sound-impulses to the brain. It has been customary for physiologists to

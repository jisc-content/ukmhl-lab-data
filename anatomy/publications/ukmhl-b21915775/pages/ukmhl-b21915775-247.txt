231 SPINAL NERVES. of nerves in the lower part of the spinal canal; which leash surrounds the filurn terminale, and, from its general resemblance in arrangement to the hairs of a horseâ€™s tail, has been named cauda equina. fu The anterior nerve root joins the posterior immediately outside the ganglion, and by their junction a spinal nerve trunk is formed. This nerve trunk contains a mixture of both motor and sensory fibres, and is compound therefore in function. Almost immediately after its formation the nerve trunk separates into two primary divisions, an anterior and a posterior, and each division, like the nerve itself, contains both motor and sensory fibres. The Posterior Primary Divisions of the spinal nerve trunks, smaller than the anterior, are distributed both to the muscles and skin on the back of the axial part of the body. Their general arrangement is as follows: each division, except the 1st cervical, two lower sacral, and coccygeal, subdivides into an internal and an external branch. The 1st cervical or sub-occipital nerve extends backwards, lying on the neural arch of the atlas, and supplies the posterior recti, the obliqui, and complexus muscles. The two lower sacral and coccygeal unite in a loop-like manner behind the sacrum, and supply the skin. Of the cervical and upper six dorsal nerves the external branches of the posterior primary divisions supply the deep muscles of the back, in the neck and in the upper dorsal regions; the internal branches pierce the muscles close to the spines of the vertebrae, and end in the skin of the same regions; but the internal branch of the 2d nerve, called cjreat occipital, and that of the 3d cervical, pass up- wards to the skin over the occipital bone. Of the lower six dorsal and lumbar nerves the internal branches supply

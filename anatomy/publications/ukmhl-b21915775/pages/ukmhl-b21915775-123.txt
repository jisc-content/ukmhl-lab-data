JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. 107 The Ankle Joint is formed by the convex upper and the two lateral surfaces of the astragalus fitting into the con- cavity formed by the lower end of the tibia and the two malleoli. An investing ligament, lined by synovial mem- brane, encloses the joint • the external and internal lateral bands of this ligament are much stronger than the anterior and 'posterior, which are thin membranes. At the ankle joint movements of flexion and extension take place. The dorsum of the foot is bent towards the front of the leg by the direct action of the tibialis anticus, inserted into the ento-cuneiform and metatarsal of great toe, and the peroneus tertnis, inserted into the base of the metatarsal of little toe. The opposite movement, the so- called extension of the foot, is due to the action of the gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus the muscles of the calf of the leg, inserted by the Tendo Achillis into the posterior prominence of the os calcis or heel bone. This movement is made at every step in walking or running, and the great size of the calf-muscles is in relation to their use in the act of progression. The foot cannot, however, be drawn so far back as to be brought into direct line with the leg. In standing erect the foot is at right angles to the axis of the leg, the astragalus is locked in between the two malleoli, and the fibres of the lateral ligaments are tense, so as to fix the joint. Inter-Tarsal Joints.—Interosseous ligaments connect the bones situated in the transverse rows of the tarsus, e.g., the cuboid with the ecto-cuneiform; the meso- with the ecto- and ento-cuneiform ; the cuboid with the scaphoid; the astragalus with the os calcis by a powerful interosseous band. No interosseous ligaments pass antero-posteriorly between the bones placed in the internal and external

ANATOMY. 220 It approaches a cylinder in shape, but is flattened on its anterior and posterior surfaces, and presents] two enlarge- ments which have a greater girth than the rest of the cord The upper, called the cervical or b'achial enlargement, extends from opposite the 3d cervical to the 1st dorsal vertebra, and from it arise the nerves which supply the upper limbs; the lower, called the crural or lumbar enlargement, is opposite the last dorsal vertebra, and supplies with nerves the lower limbs. Between these two enlargements the cord is of almost uniform girth, and gives origin to the dorsal or intercostal nerves, and is called the dorsal part of the cord. The cord is almost completely divided into a right and a left lateral half by two fissures, named respectively anterior and posterior median fissures, the anterior of which is wider but not so deep as the posterior. Each half of the cord contains the commissures, the columns, the cornua, and the nerve roots. At the bottom of the anterior fissure are the transverse fibres of the anterior white commissure, and at the bottom of the posterior fissure the fibres of the posterior grey commissure. By these commissures the two halves of the cord are united together. The posterior commissure consists partly of nerve fibres, and partly of neuroglia called substantia gelatinosa centralis. This neuroglia surrounds an axial canal, the central canal, which extends along the whole length of the cord, and even passes into the upper end of the filum terminale. This canal is lined by a ciliated columnar epithelium, and ex- pands superiorly into the cavity of the 4th ventricle. The attached ends of these columnar cells are elongated, and project into the neuroglia which surrounds the canal. Each lateral half of the cord is divided into three

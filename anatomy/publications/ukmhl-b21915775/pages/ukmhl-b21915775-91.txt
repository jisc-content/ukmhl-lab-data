JOINTS AND MUSCLES OF AXIAL SKELETON. 75 magnum. The head rotates along with the atlas about the odontoid or pivot process of the axis; too great movement to one side or the other is prevented by the check ligaments. The nodding movements of the head take place between the occiput and atlas, and are permitted by the size and shape of the occipital condyles and hollow upper articular surfaces of the atlas. These j oints are all diarthrodial. The spine is flexible and elastic; except in the atlo-axoid joint the range of movement between any two true vertebrae is very small, but the sum of the move- ment in the entire spine, owing to the number of bones, is considerable. The elasticity of the spine is partly due to the numerous diarthrodial joints between its articular pro- cesses, but more especially to the discs of fibro-cartilage interposed between the bodies of the vertebrae, which act like elastic pads or buffers to prevent shock. The muscles which move the Vertebrae on each other, and the Head on the Spine, are situated both behind and in front of the spinal column. Those behind are called the Deep muscles of the Bach, and have their fibres running either longitudinally or obliquely. Those arranged longi- tudinally are the interspinales, which pass between the spines of contiguous cervical vertebrae; the rectus capitis posticus major from the spine of the axis to the inferior curved line of the occiput j the rectus capitis posticus minor from the neural arch of the atlas to the occiput behind the foramen magnum; the intertransverscdes between the transverse processes of contiguous vertebrae; the rectus lateralis from the transverse process of the atlas to the jugal process of the occiput; and the erector spinas. The erector spinae is a great composite muscle which occupies the lumbar region and divides below the level of the last

ANATOMY. 296 teres, and lemniscus are apparently continuous below with the basis bundle of the anterior column and the mixed zone of the lateral column, whilst superiorly they, as well as the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, for the most part seem to enter the optic thalamus, though some fibres, as those of the lemniscus, go into the corpora quadrigemina. In this respect the fibres of the tegmental region differ from the peduncular fibres of the crusta, the chief destination of which is to the corpus striatum. Some of these tegmental fibres may end in the optic thalamus, but others along with fibres arising within the thalamus radiate into the white matter of the hemisphere, as a part of the corona radiata, and reach the frontal, parietal, occipital, temporo-sphenoidal lobes and the insula. The optic thalamus, corpus subtha- lamicum, corpora quadrigemina and geniculata, and nucleus tegmenti are the ganglia of interruption of the tegmentum. The comparison of the human brain with those of different mammals has shown that the development of the hemispheres bears a direct relation to the size of the crusta and its ganglia, but is in inverse relation to the size of the tegmentum and its ganglia. b, Commissural Fibres.â€”The largest of these commis- sures is the corpus callosum, which connects apparently corresponding convolutions in the opposite hemispheres. It is found only in mammals. The fibres of the genu radiate forwards and outwards into the frontal lobe. The fibres of the body pass transversely outwards into the parietal lobe, and as they lie on a plane superior to the fibres of the corona radiata, where these emerge from the corpora striata and optic thalami, the two systems of fibres intersect with each other on their way to the convolutions.

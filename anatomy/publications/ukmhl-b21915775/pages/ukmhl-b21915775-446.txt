ANATOMY. 430 The Phrenic arteries, two in number, arise from the aorta close to the crura of the diaphragm; the right phrenic passes behind the inferior cava, the left behind the oesophagus, to supply the diaphragm; they also give branches to the supra-renal capsules. The Middle Sacral artery, as already stated, is rather the continuation of the aorta downwards from the place of bifurcation than a branch of that vessel. As it runs down the front of the sacrum it gives transverse branches to the sacral wall of the pelvis. In close connection with the terminal twigs of the middle sacral artery is a body, about the size of a small pea, named by Luschka the coccygeal gland. This body, now more usually called the coccygeal body, is not a gland, but, as Julius Arnold pointed out, is composed principally of the dilated and tortuous twigs of the middle sacral artery, the middle or muscular coat of which is greatly thickened. But, in addition, a laminated arrangement of cells is found within the dilatations. The body is invested by connective tissue in which nerve cells are embedded. Branches of the ganglion impar of the sym- pathetic pass to the coccygeal body. Important anastomoses take place in the walls of the thorax and abdomen between the parietal branches of the aorta and branches of other arteries which pass to the parie- tes. If we go from the upper to the lower parts of the walls of the chest and belly, the following arteries may be seen to run from behind forwards, the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian in the first and second intercostal spaces ; the intercostal branches of the aorta in the other intercostal spaces; the lumbar branches of the aorta in the muscular

379 THE TONGUE. or palato-glossal folds. Immediately in front of each palato-glossal fold are several transverse folds of the mucous membrane, which form a series of lamellae. They are sometimes called the papillae foliatas, but are more appropriately named gustatory lamellx.1 The free surface of the mucous membrane of the tongue is generally elevated into multitudes of fine processes, called the papillae of the tongue, some of which are simple, others compound. The simple papillx are short, simple, conical elevations of the membrane, and are situated on the back part of the dorsum and the under surface of the mucous membrane, as well as scattered between the compound papillae. The compound papillx are arranged in three groups, named filiform, fungiform, and circumvallate papillae. The compound character of each of these papillae is due to the presence of several small secondary papillae projecting from it. The filiform papillx, elongated and thread-like, are the smallest and most numerous, and cover the dorsum in front of the circumvallate papillae. Th & fungiform or club-shaped papillae are scattered over the anterior and middle parts of the dorsum, and at the tip and sides. The circumvallate papillx, seven to twelve in number, are arranged in a V-shaped manner on the dorsum towards its base; a depression in the mucous membrane, called foramen caecum, marks the apex of the V: they are the largest papillae; each is sunk in a vallum or trench-like depression of the mucous membrane, which isolates it from the surrounding surface. The epithelial covering of the filiform papillse is characterised by the peculiar modification which the tessellated epithelium of the mouth has undergone; the cells have become cornified and elongated into dense, 1 The gustatory lamellae can he seen to great advantage in the tongue of the rabbit.

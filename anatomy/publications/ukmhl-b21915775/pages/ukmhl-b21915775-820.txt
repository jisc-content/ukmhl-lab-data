ANATOMY. 804 covered by a layer of endothelium, which is reflected on the testicle, so as to form a smooth visceral layer, similar to the serous epicardium which envelopes the heart. The visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis reaches the testicle at its posterior border, where it is in contact with the epi- didymis : it partially invests the epididymis, and forms a pouch between that body and the testicle. The tunica vaginalis is also prolonged for a short distance upwards along the spermatic cord, where it forms a closed sac. Sometimes a thread-like band may be seen in the cord above the tunica vaginalis, and extending upwards towards the peritoneum. This band indicates the position of a tubular connection, at one time existing between the peri- toneum and tunica vaginalis. To understand why the testicle and spermatic cord possess these several coverings, it should be stated that the gland is originally formed in the abdomen, where it has a peritoneal envelope; but that it descends through the wall of the abdomen into the scrotum, and carries along with it a covering from each of the structures in that wall, with which it comes in contact in the course of its descent. Owing to its development in the abdomen, it derives its vessels and nerves from the vascular and nervous trunks situated in that cavity. As it descends through the wall of the abdomen into the scrotum, these structures are elongated, and descend with it, and together with the vas deferens, or excretory duct of the testicle, form the sper- matic cord. The cord, after it has passed through the wall of the abdomen, like the testicle, is enveloped by the spermatic, cremasteric, and iufundibuliform fascire. The

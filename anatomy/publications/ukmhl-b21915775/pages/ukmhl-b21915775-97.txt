81 MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION. united together by ligamentous fibres, and synovial mem- branes lie between these cartilages at their place of union. The movements of the ribs and sternum at the costo- vertebral and costo-sternal joints are of the utmost importance in the process of breathing. Breathing or respiration consists of two acts with intermediate pauses— breathing in, or inspiration, and breathing out, or expiration. During inspiration the air rushes through the nose or mouth down the windpipe, and dilates the air-cells of the lungs; as the walls of the chest rise the lungs expand, so that the capacity both of lungs and chest at the end of a full inspiration is nearly doubled. During inspiration the following changes occur : the ribs are elevated and rotated outwards, their cartilages are slightly twisted, and the angle between them and the ribs is widened; the lower borders of their shafts are everted, while their surfaces are at the same time rendered more oblique, and the width of the intercostal spaces is thereby increased; the elevation and rotation of the ribs throw the sternum upwards and forwards, and make the thoracic part of the spinal column straighter; the diaphragm is depressed, and the antero- lateral walls of the abdomen are thrown forward. The muscles engaged in inspiration are as follows:—In each of the spaces between the different ribs a pair of intercostal muscles is situated (see p. 607); these elevate and rotate the ribs and the movements are assisted by the levatores costarum, and, in the case of the upper and lower ribs, by the scaleni and swrati postici muscles; and by these agents the transverse and antero-posterior diameter of the chest is increased. The increase in its vertical diameter is due to the action of the diaphragm or midriff, aided by the quad- ratus lumborum. The diaphragm forms the floor of the F

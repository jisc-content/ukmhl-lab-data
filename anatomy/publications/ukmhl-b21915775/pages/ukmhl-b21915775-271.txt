THE BRAIN—CEREBELLUM. 255 its upper tentorial and lower occipital surfaces. The tentorial surface is subdivided by fissures into two smaller lobes, named superior anterior and superior posterior (fig. 92). The occipital surface is subdivided into five lobes, posterior inf erior lobe (g), slender lobe (7t), biventral lobe (Jc), ftoccidus (m) situated immediately behind the middle Fig. 81.—Occipital surface of Cerebellum, a, vallecula; b, pyramid; c, uvula; d, nodule; e, e, margin of tentorial surface; /, /, great horizontal fissure; g g, posterior inferior lobes ; h, h, slender lobes; k,jc, biventral lobes; l, tonsil; m, flocculus; n, posterior medullary velum; o, cut surface from which the left tonsil has been detached. peduncle of the cerebellum, and amygdala or tonsil (l) which forms the lateral boundary of the anterior part of the vallecula, and lies immediately internal to the biventral lobe. The inferior vermiform process is divided into a pos- terior part or pyramid (b); an elevation or uvula (c) situated between the two tonsils; and an anterior pointed process or nodule (d). Stretching between the two flocculi, and attached midway to the sides of the nodule, is a thin, semilunar plate of white matter, the posterior medullary velum (n), whilst the layer of grey matter stretching between

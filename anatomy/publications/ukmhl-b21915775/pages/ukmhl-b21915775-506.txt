Sciatic artery pierces the pelvic fascia, and passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and appears in the buttock, immediately below the pyri- formis muscle, along with the great and small sciatic nerves. It gives off a coccygeal branch, which pierces the great sciatic ligament, supplies the origin of the gluteus maximus muscle from that ligament, and ends in the skin about the coccyx : a comes nervi ischiatici, a small branch, which accompanies the great sciatic nerve; terminal branches, which for the most part end in the lower half of the gluteus maximus, though some supply the rotator ; 1 muscles in the buttock. Not unfrequently the sciatic and <A 1 v pudic arteries arise from the internal iliac by a common )â€¢ trunk, which divides as it enters the buttock into the two arteries. i. Obturator artery passes forwards between the peri- toneum and pelvic fascia, along the side wall of the pelvis as far as the upper part of the obturator foramen, through which it passes into the thigh, where it divides into its terminal branches. It gives off in the pelvis a pubit branch, which anastomoses with the pubic branch of the deep epigastric artei'y. The terminal branches pass to the obturator externus, gracilis, and adductor muscles, and a branch enters the hip joint through the cotyloid notch. The obturator artery varies in its origin. In 361 cases examined by R. Quain, it arose in two-thirds from the internal iliac : in one case out of three-and-a-half from the deep epigastric ; in a very small proportion, partly from the internal iliac, and partly from the epigastric, and in an

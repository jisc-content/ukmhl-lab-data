642 ANATOMY. superficial, or sub-pleural lymphatics, form a network be- neath the pleural membrane, and communicate,as Klein has shown, with the pleural cavity through microscopic stomata between the endothelial cells. The deep lymphatics arise, according to Klein, in two localities. First, from the walls of the air-cells by means of irregular lacunae and anasto- mosing canals, which give origin to lymphatic vessels, that accompany the pulmonary artery and vein, and have been called perivascular lymphatics. Second, from the walls of the bronchi by irregular lacunae and anastomosing canals, situated both in the mucosa and tunica adventitia of the air-tube : they give origin to lymphatic vessels, and form a network in the adventitia of the bronchi, which Klein has named the peribronchial lymphatics. The superficial and deep lymphatics enter the bronchial glands at the root of the lung. The nerves of the lung are derived from the pneumo- gastric and sympathetic branches, from which form at the root of the lung the anterior and posterior pulmonic plexuses, from which fine nerves pass into the substance of the organ with the bronchus, and branch and are distributed along with it. Remak and Julius Arnold have both de- scribed minute ganglia on the course of these nerves; and W. Stirling has recently shown that microscopic ganglia are situated on the finer branches of the nerves which lie in the walls of the bronchial tubes.

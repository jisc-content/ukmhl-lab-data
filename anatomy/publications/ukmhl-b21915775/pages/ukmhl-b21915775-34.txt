18 ANATOMY. division of the meso-ster num itself into four segments. Each lateral border of the bone is marked by seven depressed sur- faces for articulation with the seven upper ribs. At the upper border of the pre-sternum are two depressions for articula- tion with the clavicle. The xiphi-sternum remains cartila- ginous up to a late period of life, and from its pointed form has been named the ensiform cartilage. The Ribs or Costae, twenty-four in number, twelve on each side of the thorax, consist not only of bone but of a bar of cartilage continuous with the anterior end of each bone, called a costal cartilage, so that they furnish examples of a cartilaginous skeleton in the adult human body; in aged persons these cartilages usually become converted into bone. The upper seven ribs are connected by their costal cartilages to the side of the sternum, and are called sternal or true ribs; the lower five do not reach the sternum, and are named a-sternal or false, and of these the two lowest, from being unattached in front, areâ€™ called free or floating. All the ribs are articulated behind to the dorsal vertebra, and as they are symmetrical on the two sides of the body, the ribs in any given animal are always twice as numerous as the dorsal vertebra in that animal. They form a series of osseo-cartilaginous arches, which extend more or less perfectly around the sides of the chest. A rib is an elon- gated curved bone, with a head, neck, tubercle, and shaft. The head usually possesses two articular surfaces, and is connected to the side of the body of two adjacent dorsal vertebra; the neclc is a constricted part of the bone, uniting the head to the shaft; the tubercle, close to the junction of the shaft and neck, articulates with the transverse process of the vertebra with which it corresponds numerically. The shaft is compressed, possesses an inner and outer surface,

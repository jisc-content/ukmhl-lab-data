rEEFA.CE. VI express my thanks for the care that has been taken in delineating the several objects. Except when stated otherwise, the microscopic specimens, from which the illustrations of the minute anatomy of the organs have been taken, were prepared, with his customary care and skill, by my assistant, Mr A. JB. Stirling. For the use of the woodcuts, in illustration of Dr Thinâ€™s observations, I am indebted to that gentleman, and to the publishers of the Edinburgh Medical Journal. My thanks are also due to my friend, Dr J. A. Russell, for the trouble he has bestowed in revising the proof-sheets of the latter half of the hook. March 1877. Part I., containing Chapters I. to VI., having been for some time out of print, I have, in revising this reprint, taken the opportunity of making such addi- tions and alterations as were required in the present state of the subject. February, 1882.

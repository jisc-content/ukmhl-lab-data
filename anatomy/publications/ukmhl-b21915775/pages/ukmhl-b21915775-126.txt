ANATOMY. 110 is abducted by the abductor halluds and adducted by the adductor halluds and transversalis pedis. The little toe is abducted by the abductor minimi digiti. Seven interossei, arranged generally on the same plan as those in the hand, are present; but a line through the 2d toe is that from or to which they draw. The hallux or great toe is the most important digit; a line prolonged backwards through it to the heel forms the proper axis of the foot, and the sole chiefly rests upon the pads of integu- ment situated beneath its metatarso-phalangeal joint and the heel. The hallux is much more restricted in its move- ments than the thumb: the configuration of its tarso- metatarsal joint and the attachment to it of the transverse metatarsal ligament prevent the great toe from being thrown across the surface of the sole as the thumb is thrown across the palm in the movement of opposition; an object can, however, be grasped between the hallux and second toe by the action of its adductor muscles, and persons can be trained to write with a pen or pencil held in this position. The act of walking consists in the movement forwards of the trunk by the alternate advancement of the lower limbs. Suppose a person to be standing erect, with one leg a little in advance of the other; the body, being inclined slightly forwards, is pushed in advance by the extension of the hindmost limb, so that the weight falls more and more upon the advanced leg, which at the f^me .thrift is shortened by bending the knee and ankle. The heel of the hindmost limb being then raised by the action of the muscles of the calf, the toes press against the ground so as to push the trunk so far in front of the advanced limb as to be no longer safely supported by it; the hindmost limb is then raised from the ground by muscular action, and

94 ANATOMY. brachialis into the inner aspect of the shaft, and the deltoid, which forms the fleshy prominence of the shoulder, into the outer aspect of the shaft. Abduction and elevation, or extension of the arm outwards at the shoulder joint, are due to the supra-spinatus and deltoid; adduction or depression, to the coraco-brachialis, latissimus, teres major, pectoralis major, assisted by the weight of the limb; movement forwards and elevation, to the anterior fibres of the deltoid, pectoralis, and subscapularis; backward move- ment to the latissimus, teres major and posterior fibres of deltoid; rotation outwards to the supra-and infra-spinatus and teres minor; rotation inwards to the subscapularis, pectoralis, latissimus, and teres major. A combination of abduction, movement forwards, adduction, and move- ment backwards, produces the movement of circumduction. Certain movements of the upper limb, however, take place not only at the shoulder joint, but between the two bones of the shoulder girdle; for in elevating the arm, whilst the supra-spinatus and del- toid initiate the movement at the shoulder joint, the farther elevation, as in raising the arm above the head, takes place by the trapezius and menus. The articular area for com- SerratuS, which rotate tlie SCC- plete extension lies to the right of the . , , .... clotted line. {After Goodsir.) pula at the acromio-clavicular joint and draw its inferior angle forward. The free range of movement of the human shoulder is one of its most striking characters, so that the arm can be moved in every direction through space, and its efficiency as an instrument of prehension is thus greatly increased.

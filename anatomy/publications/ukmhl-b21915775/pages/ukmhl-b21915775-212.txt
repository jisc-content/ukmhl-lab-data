The medullary sheath and the primitive mem- brane are also usually continued from the fibre over the nerve cell. Hence these bipolar cells seem to be, as Schultze expressed it, nucleated enlargments of the axial cylinder. . A remarkable modification of the bipolar nerve cell, carefully studied and described by Lionel Beale, is found in the sympathetic ganglia of the frog. The cells are pear- shaped, and from the narrow end of the pear two nerve fibres arise, one of which, called the straight fibre, forms, as it were, the stalk of the pear; whilst the other, or spiral fibre, winds spirally round the straight fibre, and then passes away from the cell in the opposite direction. Both fibres are nucleated, and at their origin consist, ap- parently, of axial cylinder substance only ; but in their course they may acquire both a medullary sheath and a primitive mem- brane. The straight fibre passes into the interior of the cell substance, and Arnold and Courvoisier believe that they have Fig. 6G.â€”Pyriform . , Nerve Cell. st, traced it into the nucleus; but the spiral straight nerve fibre; Sp, spiral nerve fibre apparently arises nearer the pen fibre; C, capsule of r 1 connective tissue Dherv of the cell. The pear-shaped cells {After Beale.') are invested by a distinct capsule of connective tissue. The nerve fibres of these cells, although they both arise close together from one end of the cell, represent its poles.

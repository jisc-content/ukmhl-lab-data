In many whales the seven cervicals are fused in the adult into a single bone. In man the body of a cervical vertebra is comparatively small, its upper surface is transversely concave, and its lower transversely convex; the arch has long and obliquely sloping laminae : the ring is large and triangular: the spine is short, bifid, and horizontal: each transverse process consists of two bars of bone, the anterior springs from the side of the body, the posterior from the arch, they unite to enclose the verlebrarterial foramen, through which, in the upper six vertebrae, the vertebral artery passes; each bar ends externally iu a tubercle: the articular processes are flat and oblique: the upper pair of notches are deeper than the lower. The 1st, 2d, and 7th cervical vertebrae have special characters. The 1st, or Atlas, has no body and only a rudimentary spine: its ring is very large : on each side of the ring is a thick mass of bone, the lateral mass, by which it articulates with the occipital bone above and the second vertebra below: the anterior arch forms the front of the ring and articulates behind with the odontoid process, whilst in front it has a small tubercle : each lamina is rounded and grooved above for the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve : the transverse processes are long but not bifid. The 2d, or Axis or Vertebra dentata, has its body surmounted by a thick tooth-like odontoid process, which is the body of the atlas displaced from its proper vertebra and fused with the axis. This process forms a pivot about which the atlas and head move in turning the head from one side to the other: the spine is large, thick, and deeply bifid: the transverse processes are short and scarcely bifid: the laminm are

162 ANATOMY. Osseous Tissue. The Osseous Tissue, or Bone, is that which constitutes the hard framework of the skeleton. Each bone consists of a hard, more or less dense, tough, and but slightly elastic material. The elasticity of the bones is more marked in young than in adult and aged persons. From differences in their external configuration, bones are divided into long or cylindrical, e.g., femur; short, e.g., carpal or tarsal bones ; flat or plate-like, e.g., scapula; irregular bones, e.g., vertebra. These variations in shape do not, however, involve differences either in composition or minute structure. Bone consists chemically of an animal and an earthy substance intimately blended together. The animal matter forms about one-third, is identical with collagen, and yields gelatine on boiling ; it imparts elasticity and toughness to the bone, and binds together the particles of earthy matter. The earthy matter forms about two-thirds, and is deposited in the animal matter. It consists chiefly of phosphate of lime, which from its abundance in bone, is frequently called “ bone earth,” but carbonate, chloride and fluoride of calcium and a small proportion of soda and magnesia salts are also present. The hardness of bone is due to the presence of the earthy matter. Bone presents two different structural characters to the naked eye. The outer part of a bone is its hardest part, and forms a dense external shell, technically called the compact tissue. The interior of a bone is much less firm, and is made up of thin delicate plates or bars, or trabeculae, which intersect each other at various angles, and form a lattice-like arrangement, technically called the spongy or cancellated tissue. The plates and bars of the spongy

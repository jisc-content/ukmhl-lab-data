ANATOMY. 550 Each lymphatic gland is surrounded by a capsule, which consists of interlacing ■■I bundles of connective tissue intermingled with non-striped muscular fibres, which in some animals, as the ox, are very numerous. "When a section is made through a gland it is seen to consist of an external, yellowish-red, rtical part, and of a central, more deeply red, medullary part, which, however, reaches the surface at the hilus. From the capsule thin laminae pass into Fig. 150.—Cluster of [Lymphatic Glands of ,i . • . , , the groin, between some of which fusion ^ne COI tZCClL SUDStaoCe has taken place, va, vasa afferentia; . yasa efferentia; a, a, small arteries, and IOl’m in it a Natural size , . . „ , trabecular framework, which divides the cortex into a number of compartments or alveoli. These alveoli contain rounded nodules, consisting of the proper glandular or follicular tissue of the lymphatic gland, which is arranged therefore as a number of follicles, called the follicles of the cortex. As the trabeculae do not form perfect partitions between adjacent follicles, the tissue of one follicle is to some extent continuous with that of those which lie around it. These follicles are formed of lymphoid tissue, resembling in structure the lymphoid follicles already

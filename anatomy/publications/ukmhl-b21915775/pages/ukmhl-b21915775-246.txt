230 ANATOMY. the occipital bone and the atlas ; the 8th between the 7th cervical and 1st dorsal vertebrae. Twelve pairs of Dorsal or thoracic nerves pass out in relation to the dorsal vertebrae: five pairs of Lumbar nerves in the region of the loins; five pairs of Sacral nerves through either the sacral foramina or the sacro-coccygeal ligament; and one pair of Coccygeal nerves through the sacro-coccygeal ligament. Each spinal nerve-trunk arises from the side of the cord by two roots, an anterior and a posterior. These roots are distinguished from each other both anatomically and physiologically. The posterior root has a swelling or ganglion, whilst no ganglion exists on the anterior root, and the posterior root contains more nerve fibres than the anterior. The posterior root is sensory, i.e., its fibres conduct impulses from the periphery into the nerve centre; whilst the anterior root is motor, i.e., its fibres conduct impulses from the centre to the peripheL-y. The ganglion on the posterior root is situated, as a rule, in the intervertebral foramen; but the posterior roots of the lower sacral nerves have the ganglia in the spinal canal. These ganglia contain nerve cells, which are bipolar in fishes, but apparently unipolar in the higher vertebrates. The siugle pole bifurcates, as Ranvier has shown, like a T, and each branch is continuous with a nerve fibre. One of the fibres probably passes along the nerve root into the cord, the other peripherally into the nerve. The roots of the spinal nerves vary in direction and length. Those of the cervical nerves are short, and run almost horizontally outwards to their respective inter- vertebral foramina; those of the dorsal are longer and more oblique ; whilst the roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves, owing to the cord ending much above the foramina through which the nerves proceed, are very long, and form a leash

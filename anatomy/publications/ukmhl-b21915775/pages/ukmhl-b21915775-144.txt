ANATOMY. 128 The white or colourless corpuscles are comparatively few in number in the healthy human blood. Welcker has estimated the normal relative number as one white to 335 red; in pregnant and menstruating women the proportion is increased to about 1 to 280. In the disease called leucocytluemia, the proportion is so materially increased that they appear to be almost as numerous as the red. The white corpuscles are minute nucleated clumps of protoplasm without a cell wall, they are therefore simple cells. The protoplasm may be coarsely or finely granulated, and possesses an intra-cellular network of fibrils. The nucleus has a similar network and becomes more distinct after the addition of acetic acid. The white are larger than the red corpuscles, their average diameter being from 251o6t.h to yjAj-g-tli of an inch. Corpuscles of a similar form are found in the blood of all the vertebrata. They do not vary so much in size in different animals as do the red corpuscles. In Triton, according to Gulliver, their average diameter is ___1__th, whilst in Herpestes griseus they are not more than W8 incb- When in the passive state these corpuscles are minute spheres, but when alive and active they can project delicate processes from any point of their circumference, which processes may branch, become greatly attenuated, assume various irregular shapes, or even detach themselves from the body of the corpuscle. These processes resemble the sarcode prolongations which Amoeba and other Rhizopods can project from various parts of their circumference (fig. 25); and as a white blood corpuscle, like an Amoeba, can by the movements of the processes change its position, the term “ amceboid movements ” has been applied to the phenomena in question. Like an Amoeba, also, a white

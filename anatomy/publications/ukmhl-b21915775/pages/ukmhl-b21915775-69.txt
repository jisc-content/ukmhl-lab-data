APPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. 53 Their lateral surfaces are also articular, except the outer surfaces of the os calcis, and cuboid, which form the outer border; and the inner surfaces of the os calcis, scaphoid, and euto-cuneiform, which form the inner border of the tarsus. The os calcis articulates with two bones; the astragalus, ento- and meso-cuneiform each with four; the scaphoid and cuboid each with five; and the ecto-cuneiform with six bones. A supernumerary bone is sometimes found in the human tarsus, from a division of either the ento-cuneiform, astragalus, os calcis, or cuboid into two parts. In some rodents and other mammals eight is the normal number of bones in the tarsus. The Metatarsal bones and the Phalanges of the toes agree in number and general form with the metacarpal bones and the phalanges in the hand. The bones of the 1st or great toe or Hallux are more massive than those of the other digits, and this digit, unlike the thumb or pollex, does not diverge from the other digits, but lies almost parallel to them. The phalanges of the four outer toes are much smaller than those of the fingers. The 1st metatarsal is the thickest and shortest. The 2d is the longest, and from it they diminish in length to the 5th. The tarsal end of the 5th projects backwards as a strong process on the outer side of the foot. The 1st, 3d, and 5th metatarsals articulate each with a single tarsal bone, viz., the 1st with the ento-cunei- form, the 3d with the ecto-cuneiform, the 5th with the cuboid. The 2d metatarsal articulates with three tarsals— the ento-, meso-, and ecto-cuneiform. The 4th metatarsal with two tarsals—the ecto-cuneiform and cuboid. The 3d and 4th metatarsals articulate on each side with the conti- guous metatarsals ; the 2d and 5th on one side only, viz., the 2d on its outer side with the 3d metatarsal, and the 5th on its inner side with the 4th; the 1st does not articulate with any metatarsal.

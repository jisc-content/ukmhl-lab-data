ANATOMY. 26 bulbs, and the branches of the nerves of smell, called olfactory or 1st cranial nerves, pass from the bulbs through the holes in this plate into the nose. The central portion of the bone (mes-ethmoicl) is a mesial perpendicular plate ; it forms a part of the nasal septum, reaches at its anterior border the nasal bones, and projects above the cribriform plate as the crista galli. Each lateral mass consists of an external smooth plate, os planum, which assists in forming the inner wall of the orbit, and of an internal convoluted part called superior and middle spongy plates or ethmo- turbinals, which enter into the formation of the outer wall of the nostril. These turbinals are associated with the distribution of the nerves of smell; in the toothed whales, where there are no olfactory nerves, the turbinals are absent, whilst in some mammals, as the crested seal, they assume a highly convoluted form. The lateral masses are hollowed out into air-sinuses, called ethmoidal cells, which communicate with the nostrils and with corresponding sinuses in the sphenoid and fiâ€™ontal bones. These cells are partially closed in on each side by the lachrymal bone. The Frontal, or bone of the Forehead (figs. 6 and 7), consists originally of a right and left lateral half, united by the frontal suture in the middle line of the forehead. As a rule, this suture disappears in early life, and a single greatly curved bone is formed. It lies in front of the sphenoid and parietals with which it articulates. The bone is convex forwards, to form the rounded forehead, and presents two eminences, the centres of ossification of the bone; at the root of the nose is an elevation called glabella, extending outwards, from which, on each side, is the supra-ciliary ridge, corresponding to the position of the eyebrow. In the crania of some races, e.g., the Australian,

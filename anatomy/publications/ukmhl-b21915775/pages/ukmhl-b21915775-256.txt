ANATOMY. 240 c. Obturator, also from tlie 3d and 4th. lumbar nerves, leaves the pelvis through the obturator foramen, and supplies muscular branches to the obturator externus, gracilis, three adductor muscles of the thigh, and the pectineus; it also supplies articular branches to the hi[ and knee joints, and not unfrequently gives a cutaneout branch to the skin of the lower part of the inner side ol the thigh, which joins the internal cutaneous and long saphenous branches of the anterior crural, d, An Accessory Obturator nerve, also from the 3d and 4th lumbar, is some- times present, which descends in front of the os pubis and goes to the pectineus, to the hip-joint, and also joins the obturator nerve. The Lumbo-sacral Cord is formed of the 5th lumbai nerve and of a branch from the 4th lumbar (fig. 77). It joins the sacral plexus. Before the junction it gives origin to a communicating and a muscular branch. The Com- municating branch joins the 5th lumbar ganglion of the sympathetic. The Muscular branch, or superior gluteal nerve, supplies the gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae fern oris. The Sacral Plexus is the largest of all the plexuses. It is formed by the junction of the lumbo-sacral cord, the 1st, 2d, 3d, and part of the 4th sacral nerves, and lies in the pelvis as a flattened mass in front of the pyriformis muscle and sacrum (fig. 77). It gives origin to communicating, muscular, and mixed branches. Communicating brauches join the upper sacral ganglia of the sympathetic cord. Muscular branches supply the upper fibres of the gluteus maximus, pyriformis, genrelli, quadratus femoris, and obturator internus. The Mixed nerves are as follows :â€” a, Deep Pudic, which supplies superficial perineal branches

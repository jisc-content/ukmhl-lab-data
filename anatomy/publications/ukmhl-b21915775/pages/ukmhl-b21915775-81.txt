ARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 65 is perpendicular to the margins of the bones and the sutures and synchondroses which connect them together. The growth of the skull in length is therefore at right angles to the basi-cranial synchondrosis and the vertical transverse group of sutures; its growth, in breadth, to the median longitudinal group, and in height to the lateral longitudinal group. So long as any of the cartilage or membrane between the margins of the bones remains unossified, bone may continue to form, and the skull may increase in size. It sometimes happens that the cartilage or membrane is prematurely ossified in a particular locality, and the further growth of the skull put a stop to in that region; if the brain is still growing, the skull must increase in other directions to allow the necessary expansion of the cranial cavity, and deformities of the skull are thereby occasioned. One of the most usual of these defor- mities is due to premature closure of the sagittal suture, causing stoppage of the growth of the skull in breadth, and, by way of compensation, great increase in its length, so as to produce a very elongated and somewhat boat-shaped cranium (fig. 14). The movable joints are divided into the amphiarthrodial and the diarthrodial joints. An amphiarthrosis or half-joint has only a feeble range of movement. It consists of two bones, each of which has its articular surface covered by a plate of cartilage, and these plates are firmly con- nected together by an inter- mediate disc of fibro-cartilaae.

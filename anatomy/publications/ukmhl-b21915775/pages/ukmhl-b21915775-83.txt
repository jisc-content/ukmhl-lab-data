ARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 67 The form of the articular or movable surfaces varies very materially in different examples of these joints, and the modifications in form determine the direction of the move- ments of the joints. In some, as the carpal and taisal joints, the surfaces are almost flat, so that they glide on each other; the movement is comparatively slight, and about an axis perpen- dicular to the moving surfaces : these are called 'plane-surfaced joints or arthrodia. In other joints the articular surfaces may be regarded as produced by the rotation of a straight or curved t t , • i • • ,i the cuvity is subdivided into 11116 about au axis lying 1U tD6 two an interposed fibro-car- i ,, n , tilage or meniscus, Fc. The same plane j tnese are called votci- other letters as in tig. ig. tion joints, and they present various modifications according to the direction and relation of the rotating line to the axis. One form of a rotation joint is the pivot joint, in which the movement takes place about the axis of one of the bones, which is the axis of rotation of the joint; examples of this joint are found in the joint between the atlas and the odontoid process of the axis and in the radio-ulnar joint. Another form is the ginglymus or hinge joint, in which the axis of rotation of the joint is perpendicular to the axis of the two bones; the movements of the hinge are called flexion when the angle between the two bones is diminished, and extension when the angle is increased. An important modification of the ginglymus is the screwed-surfaced joint, an example of which is found in the ankle; here the plane of flexion is not perpendicular, but oblique to the axis of the joint. The saddle-shaped and oblong joints are also

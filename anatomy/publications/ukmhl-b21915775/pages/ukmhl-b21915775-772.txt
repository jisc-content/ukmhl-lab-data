756 ANATOMY. structure of bone, and consists of a lamellated matrix with perforating fibres, lacunae and canaliculi. The lacunae are irregular in size and mode, of arrangement, and vary also in the number of the canaliculi proceeding from them- Sometimes the canaliculi anastomose with the branched terminations of the dentine tubes. In the thin cement situated near the neck of the tooth the lacunae are usually absent. If the jaw with its contained teeth be softened in acid, and sections be made so as to show the teeth in situ, there is no difficulty in recognising the cellular masses of nucleated protoplasm within the lacunee, which resemble Fig. 207.â€”Section through the socket and'fang of a Tooth, b, the hony wall of a socket, its lacuna; contain the boue corpuscles; /, the fibrous, and r, the reticulated portion of the alveolo-dental periosteum, in which transversely divided vessels, v,v, may be seen; c, the cement, the lacuna; of which contain the bone corpuscles; cl, the dentine.

In old teeth the cement thickens at the tip of the fang, and often closes up the orifice into the pulp cavity ; the passage of the nerves and vessels into the pulp is thus cut

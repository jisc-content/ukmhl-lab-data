2 ANATOMY. reference to the succession of forms which it exhibits at various periods from its first appearance as an embryo to the assumption of its adult characters, this is termed Developmental or Embryological Anatomy ; (b) with reference either to the form of the animal and of its con- stituent parts, or to the investigation of the laws by which form is determined, termed Morphological Anatomy ; (c) with reference to the function, use, or purpose performed by a part or structure in an animal, termed Teleological or Physiological Anatomy ; (d) with reference merely to the relative position of different parts or structures, termed Topographical or Regional Anatomy, and as a knowledge of the anatomy of regions is important to the surgeon and physician, this branch is sometimes called Surgical and Medical Anatomy ; (e) with reference to the structure and general properties of the tissues or textures which enter into the construction of the parts or organs of animals; to this branch of study have been applied the terms General Anatomy, Anatomy op Textures, Histology, and, from the microscope being so largely employed in the examination of the textures, Microscopic or Minute Anatomy ; (J) with reference to the changes induced by disease in the organs or tissues, termed Morbid or Pathological Ana- tomy. From its manifold aspects Anatomy forms the basis of the Biological Sciences. As a knowledge of the laws of motion is essential, and must be constantly recurred to at every step before any true progress can be made in the inves- tigation of the physical sciences, so must the structure of the human and animal frame be constantly appealed to by the zoologist in all attempts at classification; by the physiologist in all inquiries into the functions performed by the organs and textures in a state of health, and into the special

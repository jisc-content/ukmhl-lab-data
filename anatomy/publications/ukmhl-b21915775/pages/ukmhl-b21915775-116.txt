ANATOMY. 100 the 1st phalanges, and are inserted one into the extensor tendon on the dorsum of each finger; these muscles bend the 1st phalanges on the metacarpal bones, but from their insertion into the extensor tendons they also extend the 2d and 3d phalanges on the first. The little finger has also a special flexor brevis minimi digiti inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the 1st phalanx. The fingers are extended or straightened by the extensor muscles arising on the back of the fore-arm. The extensor communis divides into four tendons, one inserted into the back of the 2d and 3d phalanx of each finger. The index and little have each an additional extensor muscle, the tendon of which joins that of the common extensor passing to the same finger. The index finger possesses more independent movement than the other digits—hence its more frequent use as a “pointer”; the extensor tendons of the little and ring fingers are usually united together, so that these digits are associated in their movements. Abduction and adduction of the fingers are caused by seven small muscles situated in the intervals between the metacarpal bones',—hence called interossei; four of these lie on the dorsum of the hand, three on its palmar surface; they are inserted both into the sides of the first phalanges and the extensor tendons; the dorsal muscles abduct the fingers from a line drawn through the middle finger, the palmar muscles adduct them to that line. The little finger has also a special abductor minimi digiti inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the 1st phalanx, and too great abduction is checked by the transverse metacarpal ligament. The little finger has also a special opponens minimi digiti inserted into the shaft of its metacarpal bone. The human hand is a perfect instrument of prehension ; not only can the individual fingers be bent

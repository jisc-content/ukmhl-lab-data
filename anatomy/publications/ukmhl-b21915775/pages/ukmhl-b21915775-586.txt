570 ANATOMY. SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. The Supra-renal Capsules or Glands, or Adrenals, are two bodies situated in the cavity of the abdomen, one in relation to the upper end of each kidney. Each gland lies at about the level of the twelth dorsal vertebra, and is in contact with the fleshy part of the crus of the dia- phragm by its posterior surface. In front of ihe right gland is the liver; in front of the left gland are the pancreas and spleen. Each gland has been compared in shape to a cocked hat, and the lower concave surface fits on the upper end of the kidney, to which it is attached by areolar tissue. A fissure, named the hilus, which trans- mits the supra-renal vein, exists in the anterior surface. Each gland measures on the average about 1-| inch in its vertical diameter, 1 inch in its transverse, and J inch in thickness. Relatively to the size of the entire body, these glands are somewhat larger in new-born children than in adults. Struchire.â€”The supra-renal gland is invested by a thin capsule of connective tissue; it sends processes into the interior of the gland, which form a trabecular arrange- ment, in the meshes of which cells are situated. If the gland be cut across, it is seen to be divided into an exter- nal, firm cortical part, of a yellow colour; and a central, soft, medullary part, of a deep brown colour. The cortical part consists of cells imbedded in a tra- becular framework of connective tissue, and is described by Julius Arnold as if arranged in three zones. The outer layer, or zona glomerulosa, is thin, and its connective tissue surrounds roundish spaces or alveoli, occupied by

ANATOMY. 796 the pubis the fascia gives rise to a strong band, which passes inwards to the pelvic viscera, and may appro- priately be called the visceral division of the pelvic fascia. Where this visceral band is given off the fascia is whiter and more opaque, and is known as the white line. The most anterior part of the visceral division of the fascia passes backwards, in the male, to the upper surface of the prostate gland, forming the pubo-prostatic ligament, and is then reflected on the front of the bladder as its anterior true ligament. The lateral portion of the visceral division passes inwards, and, in the male, splits into three layers, the most superior of which reaches the side of the bladder to form its lateral true ligament; the middle layer goes between the base of the bladder and the rectum as the redo-vesical layer of the fascia; whilst the most infeiâ€™ior layer forms the redal layer, which passes under the second and third parts of the rectum and ensheaths the levator ani. The pubo-prostatic ligament gives rise to the fibrous capsule of the prostate gland, and the recto-vesical layer ensheaths the vesicula? seminales, and the corresponding parts of the vasa de- ferentia, which lie between the rectum and bladder. The Urachus, which is prolonged from the apex of the bladder to the anterior wall of the abdomen, is a fibrous cord, representing, in the adult, an embryonic canal, con- necting the bladder with the extra-abdominal part of the allantois. As development advances the allantois disap- pears and the urachus shrivels up into a fibrous cord, sometimes called the middle vesical ligament. Cases some- times occur in which the urachus remains pervious for a short distance, and communicates with the bladder.

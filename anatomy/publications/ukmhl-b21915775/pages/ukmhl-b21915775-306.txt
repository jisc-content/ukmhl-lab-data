ANATOMY. 290 intermingled with the angular cells of the 4th layer. In the inferior frontal or Broca's convolution, behind the ascending branch of the Sylvian fissure, he has sometimes found giant pyramidal cells in the 3d layer. Lewis states that they also occur in the superior and middle frontal convolutions, and sparingly along the anterior aspect of the ascending parietal convolution deep in the fissure of Rolando. The convolutions in which these giant pyramidal cells are found are the most important of the motor centres of Ferrier. Behind the ascending parietal convolution a six laminated arrangement of the cortical grey matter is described by Lewis, due to the smaller pyramidal cells of the 3d layer forming a distinct layer below the larger pyramidal cells, and at the same time undergoing a numerical increase. The pole of the occipital lobe, the cuneus, and the gyrus lingualis, present a white streak in the grey matter known to Yicq dâ€™Azyr; it is interposed between the layer of smaller (2) and the layer of larger pyramidal cells (3). This white streak is laminated, and consists of two granular layers and of longitudinal nerve fibres, so that eight layers are described in the occipital lobe (Clarke, Meynert, Betz). The grey cortex of the Island of Beil has been studied by Major, who states that it agrees with the general arrangement, but the cells of the 3d layer are usually smaller in the insula. Fusiform cells, with the long axis parallel to the surface, form the chief constituent of the grey claustrum, which is situated deeper than the grey matter of the Island, and is separated from the outer part of the corpus striatum by a thin layer of white matter. Fusiform cells also occur abundantly in the nucleus amyg- dalae, a grey mass situated below the corpus striatum, which in some sections seems as if isolated, but in reality is con-

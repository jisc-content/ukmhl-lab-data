147 CONNECTIVE TISSUES. cellular substance, the latter of which is differentiated into fibres, may be recognised. The cells are either fixed cells, or wandering cells. The wandering cells are leucocytes, like the white corpuscles of the blood. The fixed cells are the proper connective tissue corpuscles. These corpuscles are not uniform in appearance. When seen on edge they appear elongated or fusiform or caudate, when seen on their surface they are flattened plates, often with branched processes so as to have a stellate form. In tendons they are arranged in definite rows (Kanvier) and appear as rectangular plates, and the cells in the same row are con- nected together by cement substance. Klein states that these corpuscles frequently consist of two substances; of a hyaline ground plate in which is an oval nucleus containing an intra-nuclear network, and of a granular material con- taining an intra-cellular network of fibrils. In the rectangular cells of tendons the nucleus is usually placed near one border of the cell, and the nuclei of contiguous cells lie near the borders which are next each other. Lines described by Boll are really projections of the cell in a direction perpendicular to the rectangular plate, which adapt it more precisely to the surface of a bundle of fibres. The inter-cellular substance or matrix consists of fibres, which are not uniform in shape, and are divided into the two groups of white and yellow fibres.] The white fibres of connective tissue constitute the most common form, and make up the great bulk of most liga- ments, tendons, and fibrous membranes. They consist of excessively delicate fibrils varying from ^-gwo-th to Ttroinrth inch in thickness, which are united together in bundles or fasciculi of variable size. The bundles, as well as the fibrils of which they are composed, have a wavy course, and

ANATOMY. 818 THE URETHRA. The Male Urethra is the excretory duct for the urine and seminal fluid. It extends from the neck of the bladder to the opening at the end of the glans penis. Its average length is from 8 to 9 inches, and it varies in length with the size and condition of the penis. In the erect state of the penis it forms a continuous curve, with the concavity directed towards the pubic arch. In the flaccid penis it makes, at first, a curve with the concavity directed towards the pubic arch; but when it reaches the penis it changes its direction, and forms a second curve, with the concavity directed downwards. It is lined by a mucous membrane continuous at one end with that of the bladder, and at the other with the tegumentary covering of the glans. The epithelial covering of the prostatic part of the mucous membrane is, near the bladder, laminated and with an arrangement of cells similar to the epithelium of the bladder, but in the rest of the urethra, as far forwards as the fossa navicularis in the glans penis, the epithelium is columnar. At the external orifice again it is stratified and squamous. Beneath the mucous membrane is the sub- mucous coat, iu which, in addition to the fibres of connec- tive tissue, there are non-striped muscular fibres arranged both longitudinally and circularly. Ellis has shown that the longitudinal fibres are continuous with the internal longitudinal muscular fibres of the bladder. As the external relations of the urethra vary in different parts of its extent, it is divided into three parts, the pros- tatic, membranous, and spongy portions. The prostatic

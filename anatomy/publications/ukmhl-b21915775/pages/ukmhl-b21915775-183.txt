OSSEOUS TISSUE. 167 small blood-vessels ramify. The internal soft layer is especially well marked in young growing bones. It partly consists of very delicate connective tissue, in which rounded or oval cells are found, which give off slender processes at various points of their periphery, and partly of larger granular cells called osteo- blasts (Gegenbaur) which lie next the bone itself. In adult bone the osteoblasts are much less numerous than in growing bone. The deep layer is also vascular, and its Vessels, along with the soft Fig. 54.—Section through the Perios- ... . • i . . , teum and Compact Tissue of a Young cellular material which sur- Bone.

Goodsir pointed out, a layer of cellular substance lies be- tween the wall of the canal and its contained blood-vessel, so that these canals are not, as in macerated bones, empty passages, but are occupied by blood-vessels and the deep cellular layer of the periosteum. ; The Marrow occupies the medullary canal of a long bone and the spaces in the cancellated tissue of bones generally. It occurs in two forms, red aDd yellow marrow. Red marrow is found in the bones of the foetus generally, and in the cancelli of the plate-like, short, and irregular bones at a more advanced period. It consists largely of colossal many-nucleated cells (fig. 56), the myeloid cells (myelo- plaxes) of Robin, also of leucocytes and of cells like red blood corpuscles but nucleated (Neumann and Bizzozero). The cells are supported by a delicate areolar tissue, and are supplied by a network of capillary blood-vessels. Yellow

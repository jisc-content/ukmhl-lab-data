INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 485 muscles. It supplies a cutaneous branch to the skin of the heel: muscular branches to the muscles of the sole: marginal branches to the skin of the outer border of the foot. From the plantar arch arise three posterior perforating branches, which pass between the heads of the dorsal interossei muscles and inosculate with the interosseous branches of the meta- tarsal artery: four digital branches, of which the first supplies the outer side of the little toe ; whilst the second, third, and fourth divide at the clefts between the toes, and supply the contiguous borders of the fifth and fourth, fourth and third, third and second toes; from the digital arteries anterior perforating branches pass at the clefts between the toes to the dorsum of the foot, to inosculate with the branches of the metatarsal artery prolonged on to the dorsum of the toes. The Internal Iliac artery, the__ smaller of the two terminal branches of the common iliac, commences at the lumbo-sacral joint, sinks into the cavity of the pelvis, and after a course of about one inch and a half, divides oppo- site the great sacro-sciatic foramen into several branches. It lies behind the peritoneum, and is crossed by the ureter. It is in front of the psoas, the upper origin of the pyriformis, the internal iliac vein and the lumbo-sacral nerve, and at its termination is situated in the loose areolar tissue which separates the peritoneum from the pelvic fascia. In the foetus the internal iliac artery is a more impor- tant vessel than it is after the birth of the child, for by it the impure blood of the foetus is conveyed to the pla- centa. Accordingly it does not end in the pelvis, but runs along the side of the upper part of the bladder, and the back of the anterior wall of the abdomen as far as the

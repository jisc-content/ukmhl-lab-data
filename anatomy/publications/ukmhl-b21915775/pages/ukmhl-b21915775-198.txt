ANATOMY. 182 in the living fibre of the consistency of a viscous fluid, and that the anisotropic sarcous elements of the dim discs are suspended in it. Kiihne supports this view by an observa- tion in which he saw a living nematode worm, within the sarcolemma of a living fibre, moving from one end of the fibre to the other, and temporarily displacing the sarcous elements. Haycraft has recently advanced another and more simple explanation of the cause of the transverse striation based on the observation that a muscular fibre is not a smooth cylinder, but has a sinuous surface. The transverse striae correspond with the inequalities of the surface; at the focus usually employed in examining the fibre the dark stripes mark the minute elevations running around the fibre, whilst the light stripes lie in the depres- sions or valleys between the elevations. The dark and light appearances being due to the thicker and thinner parts of the fibre acting on the rays of light which pass through the fibre, in the one case as a converging lens producing a dark stripe, in the other as a diverging lens producing a light stripe. Some peculiar modifications of the striped muscular fibre are met with in certain localities. As a rule, this form of fibre does not branch; but in the muscles of the tongue and lip, aud other muscles of the face, these fibres usually branch prior to their insertion, and the branches taper off to finely attenuated ends. In the Heart the fibres branch; and the branches of adjacent fibres anastomose, so that the muscular wall of this organ consists of a compact network of fibres. The individual fibres are smaller than those of the voluntary muscles; they consist of oblong muscle cells, the substance of which is faintly transversely striped, the investing

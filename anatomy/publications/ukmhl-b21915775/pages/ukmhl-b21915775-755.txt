As these passages can be injected from the hepatic duct, and as they convey bile from the interior of the lobule into the duct, it is obvious that they must be continuous with the lumen of the interlobular branches of the duct, at the periphery of the lobules. The wall of an interlobular duct consists of a membrana propria, lined by columnar epithelium. From this duct fine branches enter the peri- phery of the lobule, and the epithelial lining abuts on and assumes the character of the rows of hepatic cells, whilst the intercellular passages of the biliary network become continuous with the lumen of the duct. The wall of the larger bile ducts is formed of a fibro- elastic tissue, with a proportion of non-striped muscular fibre : it is lined by a columnar epithelium. Opening into the larger ducts are numerous orifices, which com- municate with branched ocecal tubes and follicles, situated within and clustered around the walls of the larger ducts, often in considerable numbers. Some of these appendages to the duct doubtless serve as glands for the secretion of mucus, but others are probably, as Beale supposed, mere diverticula of the duct, in which the bile may be tem- porarily retained, as in the gall bladder. The hepatic duct also gives origin to some aberrant ducts, which were described by Kiernan and Henle as passing into the left lateral ligament of the liver, and into the fibrous bands, which sometimes bridge over the

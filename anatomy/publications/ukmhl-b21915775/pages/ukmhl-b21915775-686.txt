The external layer is com- posed of fibres arranged longitudinally in the wall. They are collected into three bundles; one springs from the back of the cricoid cartilage and descends in the anterior wall, the others are situated at the sides of the oesophagus; as they reach its lower end the fibres are no longer collected into three bundles, but form a uniform layer around the tube. The internal layer consists of fibres arranged in a series of rings around the tube, which lie sometimes horizontally, at others obliquely. The muscular coat in the upper fourth of the oesophagus is red, and its fibres are transversely striped; in the second fourth numerous non- striped fibres are mingled with the striped; whilst in the lower half the coat consists exclusively of non-striped fibres. By the contraction of the fibres of the muscular coat the food is propelled downwards into the stomach. Hyrtl described in 1844 muscular slips as occasionally found passing from the oesophagus to the pleura and left bronchus. D. J. Cunningham, who has recently examined this arrange- ment, states that the 2^euro'oesoP^ia9eal muscle arises from the left pleura, where it lies over the thoracic aorta, and joins the left margin of the oesophagus; it is always present. The broncho-oesophageal muscle is not so constant; it springs from the back of the left bronchus, and blends with the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus. The sub-mucous coat connects the muscular and mucous coats with each other. It consists of bundles of white fibrous tissue intermingled with elastic fibres, and the

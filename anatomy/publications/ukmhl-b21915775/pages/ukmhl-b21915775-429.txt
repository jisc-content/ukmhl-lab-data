413 THE HEART. outwards to allow of the free passage of the fluid. To prevent, during the ventricular contraction, the regurgita- tion of blood into the auricles, the auriculo-ventricular valves are floated away from the sides of the ventricle across their respective openings, and by the apposition and slight overlapping of their edges temporarily close the opening. The tilting upwards of the valves into the auricle is prevented by the contraction of the musculi papillares and their connection with the cusps of the valve through the chordae tendinese. Pettigrew has shown that casts of the ventricular cavities, more especially of the left, have the form of a double cone, spirally twisted from right to left, and has described the blood as forced in spiral streams against the under surface of the segments of the valve, which are twisted and wedged into each other so as to prevent regurgitation. The propulsion of the blood into the arteries distends the elastic wall of those tubes; but when the ventricular contraction has ceased, the elastic wall recoils, and the blood is propelled onwards into the capillaries in the course of the circulation. The regurgitation of the blood from the arteries into the ventricles is prevented by the closure of the semilunar valves, the segments of which are thrown across the arterial orifices through the pressure exercised by the elastic re- bound of the arterial walls on the column of the blood in the lumen of the artery and in the sinuses of Yalsalva. If we commence, therefore, at the pulmonary capillary system, where the blood becomes pure or arterial, we find that it flows, as arterial blood, successively into the pul- monary veins, left auricle, left ventricle, aortic system of arteries, and systemic capillaries. In the systemic capil-

KIDNEY. mediary and convoluted tubes, it consists of a clouded mass of nucleated protoplasm, which presents a very im- perfect differentiation into individual cells; this mass so fills up the tube as to leave a very small lumen. In the looped tubes the epithelium is flattened, and with distinct ovoid nuclei, which project towards the lumen of the tube; but from the observations of W. Pye, cubical epithelium occurs in the wider parts of the looped tube, and where the tube joins the intermediary tube, the cells are more elongated, and the lumen of the tube is diminished. The intervals between the tubes both in the medullary and cortical parts of the kidney, are occupied by connec- tive tissue and blood-vessels. The connective tissue stroma within the kidney was first described by Bowman and Goodsir. In the medullary region this tissue is distinctly fibrillated, but in the cortex the fibrillated tissue is very sparing, and the connective tissue stroma of the gland consists essentially, as Arnold Beer pointed out, of spindle- ) shaped and stellate corpuscles. The blood-vessels of the kidney consist of the renal artery and renal vein, with their capillaries. The renal artery arises from the side of the abdominal aorta, and runs transversely outwards to the hilus of the kidney, where it divides into several branches before entering the gland. Sometimes two, or even three, renal arteries arise independently from each side of the aorta. The branches of the renal artery enter the hilus between, the calices of the ureter; they penetrate and divide into smaller branches within the columns of Bertin, or pro- longations of cortical substance that lie between the sides of the medullary pyramids. When they reach the level of

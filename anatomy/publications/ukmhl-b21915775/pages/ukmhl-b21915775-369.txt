THE EYEBALL. 353 delicate structureless membrane, the hyaloid membrane ; immediately within which small amceboid cells have been described by Ciaccio and Ivanoff. Huschke and others have described a layer of epithelial cells as present on the surface of the hyaloid membrane. Almost opposite the ora serrata the hyaloid membrane passes forwards from the vitreous body, in relation to the deep surface of the ciliary processes, but separated from them by the pars ciliaris retinae, and then inclines inwards to become attached to the anterior surface of the capsule of the lens close to its circumference. It is named the suspensory ligament of the lens, or zonule of Zinn, and contains fibres, which run in the meridional direction. Where it leaves the vitreous body a narrow space is enclosed between it and that body, which space surrounds the circumference of the lens, and is called the canal of Petit. From the relation of the suspensory ligament to the ciliary processes it has a plicated surface, aud when these processes are torn away from it, a portion of the pigment of the processes is often left behind, so that the zonule is sometimes named the ciliary processes of the vitreous body. In addition to the lymphatics of the cornea and retina already described, the recent researches of Schwalbe have shown that spaces exist within the eyeball which com- municate with the lymphatic system. The slit-like in- terval between the sclerotic and choroid, or perichoroidal space, is regarded as a receptacle for lymph lined by an endothelium; from it lymphatics arise, which pierce the sclerotic alongside the veins, and communicate with the space of Tenon which lies between the exterior of the eyeball and its investing tunic of fascia. The lymph formed in the iris and ciliary processes is believed to be poured into the anterior chamber, and from it into the z

313 ENCEPHALIC NERVES. shaped bend of the porfcio dura, and a sympathetic root from the carotid plexus, which runs along with the great petrosal, and forms with it the Vidian nerve. The ganglion gives origin to—a, an orbital branch, which supplies a layer of non-striped muscular fibres, described by H. Muller and myself as developed in connection with the periosteum of the orbit, where it covers the spheno-maxillary fissure : b, upper nasal and naso-palatine branches to the mucous membrane of the nose and anterior part of hard palate : c, descending palatine branches to the mucous membrane of the hard and soft palate, and through them the fibres of the portio dura conveyed by the Vidian to Meckel’s gan- glion are transmitted to the levator palati and azygos uvulae : d, pterygo-palatine to the mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharynx. The 3d or Inferior Maxillary division passes out of the skull through the foramen ovale, and as it does so is joined by the whole motor root of the 5th nerve. By the junction a mixed nerve is formed, which is the sensory nerve for the lower part of the face, and the skin of the temple, and the motor nerve for the muscles of mastication. Immediately after passing through the foramen this nerve divides into a smaller and larger division, in each of which motor and sensory fibres are found. The smaller division supplies motor masticatory branches to the masseter, temporal, external and internal pterygoid muscles. It also gives off a long buccal branch, which, though often described as the motor nerve for the buccinator muscle, is really a sensory nerve for the skin and mucous membrane of the cheek: the sensory nature of this nerve is proved, both by physiological and pathological experiments, and by tracing its fibres through the buccinator muscle to the mucous

The External Meatus leads from the bottom of the concha into the temporal bone, and is separated from the tympanum or middle ear by the membrana tympani. It is a crooked passage inch long, inclined at first forwards and upwards, then downwards and inwards. The wall of the outer end of the passage is formed of fibro-cartilage continuous with the cartilage of the auricle, whilstthat of the deeper end is formed of the plate-like tympanic part of the temporal bone. The passage is lined with integument con- tinuous with the skin of the auricle, in which are situated numerous hairs, together with ceruminous glands which secrete the well-known yellow “wax.” Fio. 107.—The Ear as seen in section, o, helix; b, anti-tragus; c, anti-helix; d, concha; e, lobule; /, mastoid process; g, portio dura; h, styloid process; k, internal carotid artery; l, Eustachian tube; m, tip of petrous process; n, ex- ternal auditory meatus; o, membrani tympani; p, tympanum; 1, points to malleus ; 2, to incus; 3, to stapes ; 4, to cochlea; 5, G, 7, the three semicircular canals; 8 and 9, portio dura and portio mollis.

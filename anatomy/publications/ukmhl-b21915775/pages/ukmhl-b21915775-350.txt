ANATOMY. 334 of the sclerotic. Its anterior surface is convex, and covered by the conjunctival epithelium. The forward projection of the cornea is always greater in young than in aged persons. Its posterior surface is concave, and bounds the chamber in which the aqueous humour is contained; if the chamber be punctured, and the humour evacuated, the cornea loses its translucency, tension, and forward convexity, and becomes flaccid and opaque. It has considerable thickness, and can be readily split up into laminse. When antero-posterior sections are made through it and the epithelium on its anterior and posterior surfaces, four distinct series of structures may be seen, viz., the anterior epithelium, the proper l tissue of the cornea, the posterior elastic lamina, and the posterior epithelium. The anterior epithelium of the cornea, often called the conjunctival epithelium, is stratified. The deepest layer, which lies next the cornea, is formed of columnar cells, placed vertically to the plane of the surface of the cornea. The more superficial layers are squamous cells, often with fluted surfaces and prickle-like edges. The intermediate layers are irregular in shape, and often possess, as Cleland pointed out, long digitate processes, which interlock with those of the adjacent cells. The nuclei of the cells contain an intra-nuclear network (Klein). The pr&joer tissue of the cornea is a modified form of connective tissue. When examined fresh it appears as if perfectly homogeneous, but after a time, and more especially if hardened in alcohol, chloride of gold, and other reagents, it is seen to consist of cells and an intercellular matrix. The cells consist of two kinds,â€” those which belong to the cornea, and those which have migrated into it. The proper cornea cells or cornea

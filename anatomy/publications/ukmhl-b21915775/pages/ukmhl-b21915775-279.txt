263 THE BRAINâ€”CORPORA QUADRIGEMINA. which demarcates the crus cerebri from the corpora quadri- gemina. Between the two crura is a layer of grey matter, pons Tarini, perforated by holes for small arteries and called locus perforatus posticus. Each crus cerebri consists for the most part of the pyramidal or peduncular fibres of the pons, medulla, and cord, which form its white surface or crusta, and which ascend to the internal capsule of the corpus striatum of the cerebrum. In the substance of the crus is a mass of dark grey matter, locus niger, which contains multipolar nerve cells filled with brown pigment. These cells give origin to a root of the 3d nerve. Deeper than the locus niger are the nerve fibres of the tegmentum, which are ascending from the lemniscus, fasciculus teres, posterior longitudinal fasciculus, and the superior peduncles of the cerebellum ; most of these fibres ascend to the optic thala- mus, though some go to the corpora quadrigemina. Corpora Quadrigemina. The Corpora Quadrigemina, or Optic Lobes (fig. 92), lie immediately in front of the superior peduncles of the cere- bellum, behind the posterior commissure and 3rd ventricle, between the posterior ends of the two optic thalami, and above the two crura cerebri. They present superficially both a longitudinal mesial fissure and a transverse fissure, which differentiates them into four eminences, an anterior larger pair, the nates; a posterior smaller pair, the testes From each testis a tract, the posterior brachium, passes forwards, and on it is situated an eminence, the corpus geniculatum internum, from the anterior end of which a portion of the optic tract seems to proceed. From each nates a tract, the anterior brachium, passes forwards under

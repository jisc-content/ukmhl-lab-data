THE HEART. 401 back part of the auricle, and at its mouth is the Eustachian valve. The valve of Eustachius is a crescent-shaped fold of the endocardium, situated in front of the mouth of the inferior cava: its anterior cornu is continuous with the annulus ovalis on the auricular septum, its posterior cornu is lost on the outer wall of the auricle. The valve in the adult is often perforated with holes, or is so rudimen- tary as to be functionless, but in the foetus it is a large and important structure. Close to the orifice of the inferior cava is the mouth of another large vein, the coronary venom sinus, which returns most of the blood from the walls of the heart itself; this orifice also possesses a small crescent-shaped valve, the coronary or Thebesian valve. Several minute openings, the foramina Thebesii, scattered over the inner wall of the auricle, are the mouths of small veins ramifying in the wall itself. Through these various orifices the venous blood pours into the auricle, and then flows into the right ventricle through a large orifice, the right auriculo-ventricular opening, which lies at the lower part of the auricle in front of the inferior cava. The right auricle is separated by a partition, the auricular septum, from the left auricle. On the surface of this septum is a depression, the fossa ovalis, surrounded by a raised border, the annulus ovalis, with which border the inner end of the Eustachian valve is continuous. Before the birth of the child the septum is perforated by a hole, called foramen ovale, through which the blood directed by the Eustachian valve flows from the inferior vena cava into the left auricle. This foramen closes up after the birth of the child, but sometimes a small orifice, directed obliquely through the septum, persists even in the adult.

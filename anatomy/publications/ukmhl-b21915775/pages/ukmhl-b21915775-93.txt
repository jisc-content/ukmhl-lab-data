JOINTS AND MUSCLES OE AXIAL SKELETON. 77 lajrers, named successively semi-spinalis dorsi and colli, multifidus spinx, and rotatores spinee. The semi-spinalis lies in the dorsal and cervical regions, and its fibres pass obliquely upwards and inwards from the transverse processes to be inserted into the spines near their tips ; the multifidus reaches from sacrum to axis, and its fibres pass in the same direction from the back of the sacrum, the lumbar mam- millary processes, the dorsal transverse processes, and the lower cervical articular processes to be inserted into the vertebral laminae and side of the spines; the rotatores are confined to the dorsal region, and each passes obliquely from the root of a transverse process to be inserted into the root of the spine of the dorsal vertebra immediately above. The muscles in front of the spinal column are called Pre- vertebral, and are as follows : rectus capitis anticus major, passing from the 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical transverse processes to the basi-occipital; rectus capitis anticus minor from the anterior arch of the atlas to the basi-occipital; the longus colli and the psoas. The longus colli is a composite muscle, and consists of longitudinal and two sets of oblique fibres, so that it represents in miniature the longitudinal and oblique muscles of the back; the longitudinal fibres pass from the bodies of the three lower cervicals and three upper dorsal vertebrae to the bodies of the 2d, 3d, and 4th cervicals; the lower oblique fibres extend upwards and out- wards from the bodies of the three upper dorsals to the 5th and 6th cervical transverse processes; the upper oblique fibres pass upwards and inwards from the 3d, 4th, and 5th cervical transverse processes to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas. The psoas lies in the lumbar region, and extends from the bodies of the last dorsal and the bodies and transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebrae to end

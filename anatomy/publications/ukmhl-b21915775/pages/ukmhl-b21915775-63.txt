APPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. 47 between the anterior and internal surfaces is the pectineal border, which forms part of the line of separation between the true and false pelvis. The os Pubis (fig. 11) is also a three-sided, prismatic, rod- like bone, the fundamental form of which is obscured by the modification in shape of its inner end. In human anatomy it is customary to regard it as consisting of a body and of two branches, a horizontal and a descending ramus. The body and horizontal ramus form the fundamental prismatic rod, and the descending ramus is merely a special offshoot from the inner end of the rod. The outer end of the rod enters into the formation of the acetabulum; the inner end is expanded into the body of the os pubis, and has a broad margin, or symphysis, for articulation with the os pubis on the opposite side. At the upper border of the body is the crest, which ends externally in the spine, internally in the angle. The three surfaces of the pubic rod are—a superior, for the origin of the pectineus muscle; a posterior, which enters into the wall of the true pelvis ; and an inferior, which forms the upper boundary of the obturator foramen. The descending ramus is a downward prolongation of the body of the bone which joins the ischium, and aids in forming the side of the pubic arch. The junction of the outer end of the pubis with the ilium is marked by the pectineal eminence. The superior and posterior surfaces of the pubic rod are separated by the sharp pectineal line, which, starting from the spine of the os pubis, runs outwards to aid in forming the brim of the true pelvis; the posterior and inferior surfaces are separated by a ridge next the obturator foramen, which is grooved for the obturator vessels and nerve. The Ischium (fig. 11), like the ilium and os pubis, has the fundamental form of a three-sided prismatic rod. One

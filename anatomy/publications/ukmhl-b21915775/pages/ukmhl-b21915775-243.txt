SPINAL COED. 227 surrounding the central canal. They consist both of fibres connecting the grey matter in the posterior cornua of opposite sides, and of fibres of the posterior nerve roots. The Anterior or Motor Nerve Roots enter the anterior cornu in distinct bundles, and run usually in three direc- tions, and there can be no doubt that a proportion of these fibres is continuous with the axial cylinder processes of the nerve cells. The internal fasciculi pass into the antero-internal group of nerve cells, and also into the anterior commissure to reach the opposite anterior cornu or column. The middle fasciculi pass into the antero- external group of nerve cells and also backwards into the posterior horn. The external fasciculi pass into the antero-external group of nerve cells in which they may end, and these cells may in turn give origin to fibres which pass into the pyramidal tract in the lateral column. The Posterior or Sensory Nerve Roots enter the postero-lateral fissure and divide into two bundles. The internal bundle runs longitudinally in the postero-exteraal column of the cord, and may either ascend to the brain, or may at some higher point enter the posterior cornu : fibres have also been traced into Clarkeâ€™s vesicular group of nerve cells. The external bundle enters the apex of the posterior cornu and the fibres radiate horizontally for- wards in the grey matter; some reach the anterior cornu of the intermedio-lateral group of nerve cells; others lie in relation to the cells of the posterior cornu ; others pass through the posterior commissure to the opposite side of the cord; whilst others ascend towards the brain as the longitudinal bundles in the posterior cornu. It does not appear to have been precisely determined if the posterior root fibres are directly continuous with the axial cylinder

271 THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. parieto-oecipital fissure; the depth and extent of this fissure vary in different brains in proportion to the size of these bridging convolutions. The superior annectent gyrus passes between thepostero-parietal and the superior occipital convo- lutions, whilst the second annectent gyrus connects the middle occipital with the angular gyrus. The convolutions which connect the inferior occipital convolution with the middle and inferior convolutions of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe have sometimes been named 3rd and 4th bridging convolutions. The lobes of the cerebrum, though named after the bones which form the vault of the skull, are not exactly co-terminous with them (fig. 87). The frontal lobe not only lies under cover of the frontal bone, but extends backwards under the anterior p- .t of the parietal; for the fissure of Rolando, which forms its posterior boundary, lies from 1J to 2 inches behind the coronal suture. The occipital lobe is not limited to the upper tabular part of the occipital bone, but extends forwards slightly under cover of the posterior part of the parietal; for the parieto- occipital fissure is a little in front of the apex of the lamb- doidal suture. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe not only lies under the squamous-temporal and great wing of the sphenoid, but passes upwards under cover of the lower part of the parietal; for the Sylvian fissure passes from below obliquely upwards and backwards across the line of the squamous suture near its middle. The area covered by the parietal bone so far then, from being co-terminous with the parietal lobe of the cerebrum, is trenched on anteriorly by the frontal, posteriorly by the occipital, and inferiorly by the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The convolutions of the parietal lobe itself are grouped around the parietal eminence, and in the interval between it and tho sagittal

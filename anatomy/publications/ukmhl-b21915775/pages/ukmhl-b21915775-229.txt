MEMBRANES OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 213 plane of the cavity, from the transverse groove in the occi- pital bone to the clinoid processes of the sphenoid, and is attached laterally to the upper border of the petrous part of each temporal bone. It separates the cerebrum from the cerebellum, and, as it forms a tent-like covering for the latter, is named tentorium cerebelli. A small horizontal band, the diaphragmci settee, bridges over the sella turcica, and leaves only a small aperture for the infundibulum. Along certain lines the cranial dura mater splits into two Fl”; Cranjal Sinuses. 1, Falx cerebri; 2, tentorium; 3, 3, supeuoi longitudinal sinus ; 4, lateral sinus ; 5, internal jugular vein : G occi- ^^n-I9^.nd6l’nt0rCUa|l Her??h“U’• 7’ infel'i01' longitudinal sinus; 8, veins of w9 fnd 10, 's,uPerior and inferior petrosal sinuses ; 11, cavernous sinus; 12, cncular sinus, which connects the two cavernous sinuses together: 13, ophthal- mic vein, from la, the eyeball; 14, crista galli of ethmoid bone. layers, to form tubular passages for the transmission of venous blood. These passages are named the venous blood simises of the dura mater, and they are lodged in the grooves on the inner surface of the skull referred to in the description of the cranial bones.

The dotted line W repre- sents the vertical axis of the spine. ;he cranium at its summit; the their turn support the upper limbs; whilst the pelvis, with the lower limbs, is jointed to its lower end. The spine con- sists in an adult of twenty- six bones, in a young child of thirty-three, certain of the bones in the spine of the child becoming ankylosed or blended with each other in the adult. These blended bones lose their mobility, and are called false or fixed vertebrae; whilst those which retain their mobility are the true or movable vertebrae. In the vertebrata the bones of the spine are arranged in groups, which may be named from their position—verte brae of the neck or cervical; of the chest, dorsal or thor- acic ; of the loins, lumbar; of the pelvis, sacral; and of the tail, coccygeal or caudal; and the number of vertebrae in each group may be ex- pressed in a formula. In man the formula is as follows :— C7D12L5S5Coc4 = 33 bones, as seen in the child; but the five sacral vertebrae fuse together into a single bone—the sacrum—and the four coccygeal into the single coccyx.

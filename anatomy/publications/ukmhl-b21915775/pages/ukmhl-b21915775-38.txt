22 ANATOMY. the forehead, and closes in the front of the cranial box; forming the vault and side walls are the two parietal bones; completing the side walls, and extending for a short distance along the side of the floor, are the two temporal bones; the vertex is the summit of the skull at the junction of the two parietal bones with each other. The fourteen bones of the face, which are situated below and in front of the cranium, enter into the formation of the walls of cavities which open on the front of the face; thus they complete, along with the frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid, the walls of the two orbits in which the eye-balls are lodged; along with the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid, the walls of the nostrils; and they form the osseous walls of the mouth. The six tympanic ossicles are placed in the tympanic cavities. The hyoid lies in the neck below the lower jaw. As a general rule, the cranial bones are expanded, and plate-like in form. The outer surface of each bone assists in forming the exterior of the cranium, and not unfrequently is marked by ridges or processes for the attachment of muscles. The inner surface, again, is smooth, and pitted with depressions, in which the convolutions of the brain are lodged, and also marked by grooves for the lodgment of dilated veins called blood sinuses, and of arteries termed meningeal. The two surfaces of a cranial bone, dense in structure, are called its tables, outer and inner, and are separated from each other by bone, looser and more spongy in its texture, called the diploe. In some localities, more especially in certain of the bones which form the walls of the nostrils, the diploe disappears, and comparatively wide interspaces, which contain air, separate the two tables, and are called air-sinuses. The margins of the bones are

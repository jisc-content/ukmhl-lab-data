GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 117 As a rale, however, in both vegetable and animal organ- isms the specks or clumps of protojdasm assume definite shapes, and show evidence of an internal differentiation. In the midst of a minute clump of protoplasm a definite body called a nucleus is found, which has a limiting mem- brane, and contains an intra-nuclear plexus of fine fibrils, but differs from the surrounding protoplasm in not being contractile ; sometimes a minute speck, or nucleolus exists within the nucleus. When a definite clump of protoplasm contains a nucleus in its interior, whether a nucleolus be present or not, it is called a Simple Nucleated Cell (fig. 26). Cells are definite anatomical and phy- siological units, and exhibit all the pheno- mena of life. Some of the lowest organisms consist merely of a single cell, others of two or more cells united together, and these are called uni- or multi-cellular organisms. Cells also enter in the most material manner into the constitution of the textures of all the higher forms of plants and animals.

In the earlier periods of investigation into the minute structure of cells it was believed that a cell wall was con- stantly present, and that each cell was a minute microscopic vesicle or bladder, which in its typical shape was globular or ovoid, but capable of undergoing various modifications both in form and chemical composition. The material enclosed by the cell wall was termed the cell contents, and

THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. TS 277 tlie gyrus fornicatus. The gyrus fomicatus begins at the locus perforatus anticus, it turns round the knee or anterior end of the corpus callosum, runs backwards parallel to its upper surface, then bends downwards behind its splenium or posterior end, and is prolonged forwards below the Fig. 89.—Convolutions of tlie Inner and Tentorial Surfaces of the Left Hemi- sphere. i, i, i, calloso-marginal fissure; l, calcarine fissure, the letters are on the gyrus lingualis; m, m, hippocampal fissure; n, n, collateral fissure, the letters are on the ocdpito-temporal gyrus; PO, parieto-occipital fissure; 17, 17, marginal convolution; 18, 18, callosal convolution of gyrus fornicatus; 18', precuneus or quadrilateral lobule; 19, hippocampal gyrus ; 19' uncinate gyrus; 25, cuneus or occipital lobule; 9, 9, inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolution hippocampal fissure to the tip of the tentorial surface of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, where it forms a recurved end. The part of this convolution in relation to the corpus callosum is called the callosal convolution, or gyrus cinguli, the part below the hippocampal fissure is the gyms hippocampi, and the recurved end is the uncinate gyrus. Where the callosal and hippocampal convolutions are con- tinuous with each other near the posterior end of the corpus callosum the convolution is somewhat constricted and forms the isthmus. The callosal fissure intervenes between the callosal convolution and the corpus callosum, arid at the bottom of this fissure the grey matter of the gyrus terminates in a well-defined edge. This fissure is Fr

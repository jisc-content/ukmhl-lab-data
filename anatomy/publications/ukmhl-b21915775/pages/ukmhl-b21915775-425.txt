409 THE HEAET. described these fibres of the ventricles as arranged in layers. Lower recognised two layers spirally crossing each other; Haller, three; Wolff, three in the right and six in the left ventricle. Pettigrew at one time believed he could dissect nine layers, but has subsequently reduced the number to sevenâ€”three external, a fourth or central, and three internal. He conceives that the fibres of the three external layers run in a spiral direction from left to right down- wards, the first layers being more vertical than the second, and the second than the third, whilst the fibres of the fourth or central layer are horizontal. The three internal layers also run spirally, but in the reverse direction from the external, with which they become continuous both at the base and apex. The subdivision of the ventricular wall into such precise and determinate layers as is implied in the descriptions of Pettigrew is, however, an artificial procedure. There can be no doubt, as his dissections so beautifully show, that the direction of the fibres in the ventricular wall varies at different depths; but owing to the reticulated arrangement of the fibres, not only are those connected together which lie in the same plane in one of the so-called layers, but they also anastomose with the fibres in the layers immediately superjacent and subjacent to it. Hence when one layer is peeled off, that immediately sub- jacent exhibits, not a smooth face, which it would have done had the definition of the layers been distinct, but a rough appearance, due to the rupture of intermediate connecting muscular fibres. The fasciculi form, there- fore, a network, the strands of which are arranged in two directions, one parallel to the surfaces of the ventricles, the other passing from the inner to the outer surface of 2 D

324 ANATOMY. the cerebro-spinal system. The communicating branches between the sympathetic ganglia and the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves establish a connection between them and the cerebro-spinal nervous axis. By recent experi- ments, the tract of transmission of the vaso-motor fibres has been traced along with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, through the lateral columns of the cord to the medulla oblongata, in which the vaso-motor nerve centre lies a little to one side of the mesial plane, above the calamus scriptorius. In the distribution of the sympathetic to the glandular viscera, it is important to attend to their terminations in the muscular coat of the blood-vessels of the glands, and the termination of the nerves in connection with the secreting cells themselves must be taken into con- sideration. The communications between the cerebro- spinal and sympathetic systems, through both the spinal nerves, and the pneumogastric, are to be kept in mind in considering the effects produced by varying mental condi- tions on the secretions of the glands.

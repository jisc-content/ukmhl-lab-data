MUSCLES OF PHARYNX. 89 the fauces or palate. Between the anterior and posterior pillar, on each side, the tonsil is seated. The soft palate and its pillars are invested by the mucous lining of the mouth and pharynx, and contain small but important muscles (p. 666). The muscles of the soft palate and uvula, termed levatores palati and uvula, and tensores palati, raise and make them tense during the process of deglutition. The muscles of the posterior pillars, or palato-pharyngei, by their contraction, approximate the walls of the pharynx to the soft palate and uvula, whilst the muscles of the anterior pillars, or palato-glossi, diminish the size of the fauces. The Pharynx is a tube with muscular walls, lined by a mucous membrane, which communicates above and in front with the cavities of the nose, mouth, and larynx, whilst below it is continuous with the oesophagus or gullet. It serves as the chamber or passage down which the food goes from the mouth to the oesophagus in the act of swallowing, and through which the air is transmitted from the nose or mouth to the larynx in the act of breathing. It lies immediately behind the nose, mouth, and larynx, and in front of the five upper cervical vertebrae. Its length is from 4J to 5J inches; its widest part is opposite the back of the mouth. The muscles in its walls are described on 13. 660 (figs. 20, 21). They are arranged in pairs, and are named superior, middle, and inferior constrictors, stylo- pharyngei, palato-pharyngei with sometimes the salpingo- pharyngei. The action of the muscles of the mouth, palate, and pharynx may now be considered in connection with the process of Deglutition or swallowing. When the food is received into the mouth, it is moistened by the secretion of the salivary and other buccal glands, and is broken

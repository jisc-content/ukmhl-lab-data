677 PERITONEUM. to the viscera. In the case of the liver, spleen, bladder, and uterus, these folds are named ligaments, whilst the corresponding folds which pass to the intestine have received the name of mesenteries. Folds of peritoneum also pass between certain of the viscera themselves, and these are called omenta. To understand the disposition of the peritoneum in relation to the viscera, it will be necessary to follow it from the wall to the different viscera, and from one viscus to another. If we commence with the roof of the abdo- men, we find that the peritoneum is reflected from the under surface of the diaphragm to the liver, to form the suspensory, coronary, and lateral ligaments of that organ; also from the diaphragm to the spleen as its suspensory ligament; also from the diaphragm to the stomach at its junction with the oesophagus as the gastro-phrenic ligament; also from the diaphragm to the splenic flexure of the colon as the phrenico-colic ligament. The liver is invested by the peritoneum, which is reflected from the lips of its transverse fissure to the lesser curvature of the stomach, as the two layers of the gastro-hepatic or small omentum. The anterior layer of this omentum is prolonged over the auterior surface of the stomach, and the posterior layer over its posterior surface, as far as the greater curvature. Both layers then leave the stomach and form the descend- ing layers of the great omentum, which hangs pendulous, like an apron, in front of the coils of the small intestine, and forms a free border below. At its left border the great omentum becomes continuous with the gastro-splenic omentum, and at its right border it reaches the hepatic flexure and upper end of the ascending colon. At the

74 ANATOMY. extends from axis to sacrum, and a 'posterior common ligament from front of foramen magnum to sacrum; the anterior is attached to the front of the discs and margins of the vertebral bodies, the posterior to the back of the same structures. A diarthrodial joint with a capsular ligament connects on each side the superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae. Elastic yellow ligaments, the ligamenta subflava, pass between their laminae. Inter- transverse ligaments between their transverse processes. Inter- and supra-spinous ligaments connect adjacent spinous processes; in the neck the supra-spinous ligament forms a broad band, the ligamentum nuchas, which reaches the occipital crest and protuberance. In mammals having big heads or heavy horns, this ligament of the back of the neck forms a powerful elastic band for the support of the head. The Atlo-Axoid joint is specially modified in connection with the movements of the head on the top of the spine. The intervertebral disc is absent; the articular processes are connected by a capsular ligament; a transverse ligament retains the odontoid process in place; aposterior atlo-axoicl ligament passes between the neural arches of atlas and axis, and an anterior atlo-axoid ligament from the body of axis to front of atlas. The Occipito-Atloid joint consists of capsidar ligaments uniting the occipital condyles to the superior articular processes of atlas; of an anterior occipito-atlantal ligament from foramen magnum to front of atlas, and of a posterior occipito-atlantal ligament from foramen magnum to neural arch of atlas. The summit of the odontoid pro- cess is connected to the front and sides of foramen magnum by the check ligaments, and a vertical band which forms with the transverse ligament a crucial ligament passes from the back of the body of the axis to the front of the foramen

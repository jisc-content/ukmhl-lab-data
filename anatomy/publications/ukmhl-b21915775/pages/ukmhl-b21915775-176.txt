ANATOMY. 160 discs, which give the best illustrations of the structure of white fibro-cartilage, the cells are ovoid in form and distinctly nucleated. Sometimes two or three are grouped together, but not unfrequently they occur singly. They are separated from each other by line wavy fibres like those of white fibrous tissue (fig, 51). In these discs the fibrous matrix is always stronger and more distinct in the peri- pheral than in the central part. White fibro-cartilage is transitional between true hyaline cartilage and connective tissue; i.e., the cells possess the characters of cartilage cells, whilst the matrix, instead of being hyaline, is fibrous, like the matrix of the connective tissue. The yellow elastic fibro-cartilages are the epiglottis, cor- nicula, and cuneiform cartilages of the larynx, the auricle of the human ear, and the ears of mammalia generally* and the petrous end of the cartilaginous wall of the Eustachian tube. The cells are rounded or ovoid, dis- tinctly nucleated, and usually arranged singly or in pairs. The matrix is distinctly fibrous ; the fibres, which form a close intersecting network, branch and anasto- mose, hence the name reticular fibro-cartilage sometimes given. They resist the action of acetic acid like the yellow fibres of connective tissue; and Donders has described a continuity between them and the elastic fibres of the connective tissue, which forms the investing perichondrium of this form of cartilage. The yellow fibro- cartilage has no tendency to ossify. The bars and plates of cartilage—except the encrusting hyaline cartilages, and the interarticular, marginal, and investing white fibro-cartilages—are surrounded by a fibrous membrane or perichondrium. In the adult human body cartilage is not penetrated by blood-vessels, but is nourished

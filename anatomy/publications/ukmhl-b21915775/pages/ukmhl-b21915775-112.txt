ANATOMY. 96 its head and the styloid process of the ulna; rotation of the fore-arm and hand forward is called pronation,â€” rotation backwards, supination. The direct supinator and pronator muscles are all inserted into the radius: the supinators are the supinator longus, supinator brevis, and the biceps; the pronators are the pronator teres and pronator quadratics. When delicate manipulation is required tbe fore-arm is semi-flexed on the upper arm, for the cup-shaped head of the radius is then brought into contact with the capitellum of the humerus, and the rotatory movements of the bone can be performed with greater precision. The Wrist comprises the radio-carpal, inter-carpal, and carpo-metacarpal joints, the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb being excepted. The multiplicity of joints con- tributes to the mobility of the wrist and Jgives elasticity to the junction of the hand and fore-arm. The Radio-carpal Joint is formed above by the lower end of the radius and the radio-ulnar meniscus, below by the upper articular surfaces of the scaphoid, semi-lunar, and cuneiform bones. A capsular ligament, divided into anterior, posterior, internal, and external bands, and lined by a synovial membrane, encloses the joint. It is the oblong form of hinge-joint, and possesses two axes, a long and a short; about the long axis movements occur which bend the hand forwards, or extend it on the fore-arm, or bend it backwards; about the short axis the hand may be moved towards the radial or ulnar margins of the fore-arm. The flexors forward of the hand are the palmaris longus, inserted into the palmar fascia; the flexor carpi radialis into the 2d and 3d metacarpal bones; the flexor carpi ulnaris into the pisiform, 5th metacarpal and unciform ; the extensors and flexors backwards are the extensores carpi

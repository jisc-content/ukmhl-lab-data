GALL BLADDER. 741 been made in the description of the round ligament of the liver, is an important vessel in the foetus. It conveys the blood from the placenta, enters the abdominal cavity at the umbilicus, and ascends to the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the liver. Here it divides into three branches; one joins the portal vein, and conveys the blood through that vessel into the intra-lobular capillaries and hepatic vein; another enters the liver, and divides into branches, which terminate in the intra-lobular capillaries; the third continues in the longitudinal fissure under the name of ductus venosus, and joins directly the inferior vena cava. The blood of the umbilical vein ultimately reaches, therefore, the inferior cava, either directly or by passing through the hepatic circulation. When the umbilical cord is tied after the birth of the child, the con- nection with the placenta is severed, and the umbilical vein and ductus venosus shrivel up into fibrous cords. The Gall Bladder is a reservoir for the bile, situated in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and in a notch in its anterior border (fig. 197). It is pyriform in shape, its larger end, or fundus, projects beyond the anterior border; its opposite end, or neck, gives origin to the cystic duct, which is directed to- wards the transverse fissure; after a course of 14 iuch, it joins the hepatic duct, and forms the common bile duct, ductus communis choledochus. At its neck, the gall bladder bends on itself in a sigmoid curve. The gall bladder is three or four inches long, and can hold from one to two oz. of bile. It is attached to the liver partly by areolar tissue, and partly by the peritoneum, which is reflected over its free surface.

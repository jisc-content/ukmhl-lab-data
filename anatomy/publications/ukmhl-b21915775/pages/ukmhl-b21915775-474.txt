ANATOMY. 45S ' the anterior jugular vein, which joins the subclavian, crosses its lower part. The descendens noni and com- municantes noni nerves lie in front of the carotid sheath; the vagus nerve is within the sheath, parallel to but behind and between the carotid artery and internal jugular vein; the cord of the sympathetic lies behind the sheath, between it and the pre-vertebral muscles; the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus ascends to the larynx obliquely behind the lower part of the artery. From the common carotid artery no collateral branches arise, but in addition to the terminal internal and external carotids, it gives off at and near its bifurcation some fine twigs, which form the intercarotic ganglion or intercarotic body. This body is sometimes referred to the sympathetic nervous system, but, as Julius Arnold has shown, it is principally formed, like the coccygeal body, of tortuous and dilated arterial twigs. The walls of the dilatations are not so thick as in the coccygeal body, the muscular coat is said to be absent, but the dilatations contain layers of polygonal cells. Branched nerve cells are found in the connective tissue which envelopes the body. The Internal or Deep Carotid artery, one of the two terminal branches of the common carotid, begins opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage; it ascends in the neck at the side of the pharynx and tonsil, as high as the base of the skull, then enters the carotid canal in the petrous-temporal, leaves that canal at its upper orifice and enters the cranial cavity, where it lies in a groove on the side of the body of the sphenoid bone; here it forms a sigmoid curve, and terminates close to the anterior clinoid process by dividing into the anterior and

249 THE BRAINâ€”MEDULLA OBLONGATA. inferior olive, It is arranged as a sort of capsule closed in above, below, and externally, but deficient on its inner side, and through this gap the fibres of the peduncle of the olive proceed. A little to the inner side of the inferior olive is a smaller collection of nerve cells and grey matter named inner accessory olive or nucleus pyramiclalis; and in relation to its dorsal aspect a similar mass called the outer accessory olive (fig. 80). The nerve tracts of the luhite matter of the medulla oblongata are partly continuous below with the columns of the spinal cord, and partly arise in the medulla itself from the cells of its grey matter. In the ascent through the medulla of the columns of the cord, a re-arrangement of their fibres takes place, just as in a great central railway station, the lines of rails, which enter it in one direction, intersect and are rearranged before they emerge from it in the opposite direction. The posterior pyramid, or funiculus gracilis, consists of the fibres of the postero-median column of the cord, and in its upward passage it blends with the restiform body. The restiform body, or pedunculus cerebelli, is formed chiefly by the junction of the posterior pyramid, the funiculus cuneatus or postero-external column, the funiculus Rolandi, and the direct cerebellar tract of the lateral column; but in addition it receives internal arcifgrm fibres from the region of the olive, and from the formatio reticularis and external arciform fibres from the anterior pyramid. It is customary to state that the fibres of the posterior and lateral columns of the cord, which form so large a part of the restiform body, ascend through it to the cerebellum. But the restiform body contains nerve cells, and it is possible that some, if not the whole of these ascending fibres end in the cells within the corpus

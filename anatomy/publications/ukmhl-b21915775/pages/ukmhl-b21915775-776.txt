ANATOMY. 760 bottom of the groove, where the dental papillae are pro- duced. These papillae form, at the bottom of the groovse by an increased development and growth of the corpuscles of the subjacent connective tissue. The base of each papilla kf continuous with the subjacent connective tissue, and the Fig. 209.â€”A more highly magnified view of a section through the same jaw as fig. 208; ct, sub-epithelial connective tissue j of the gum; d, primitive dental groove; e", its epithelium; e', epithelium lining in, the cavity of the mouth ; l, l, lips; e, the epiblast cuticle. The deepest layer of the epithelium consists of columnar cells. apex projects into the deeper part of the involuted epithe- lium. As a papilla increases in breadth and length, thegroove \ widens and deepens, and the involuted epithelium increasing in quantity, expands over the apex and sides of the papilla, so as to form a hood-like covering or cap for it. The cap of epithelium constitutes the enamel organ, whilst the papilla is the formative pulp for the dentine and permanent pulp. Whilst these changes are taking place in the epithe- lium and the connective tissue at the bottom of the groove, no commensurate widening occurs at its upper part, which remains for a time relatively narrow^ but retains within it

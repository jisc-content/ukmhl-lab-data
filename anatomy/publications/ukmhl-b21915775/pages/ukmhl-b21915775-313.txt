INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 297 The fibres of the splenium radiate into the occipital and temporo-sphenoidal lobes : those for the temporo-sphenoidal and lower part of the occipital are named tapetum, and form the upper and outer wall of the posterior and inferior cornua: those for the upper part of the occipital lobe are bent in a peculiar manner and form the forceps. The anterior commissure, though often described as connecting the two corpora striata, yet, as Spurzheim pointed out half a century ago, passes through these bodies^ It occurs also in the lower vertebrates, and is commissural for the two insulae and the tips of the temporo-sphenoidal lobes. It also gives a root of origin to the olfactory peduncle. The posterior commissure passes into the optic thalami. The course of its fibres has recently been studied by Pawlowsky, who states that they proceed from the pineal body, the frontal and temporal lobes, and probably also from the thalamus, and then cross over to the tegmentum of the opposite crus cerebri. c, Association System of Fibres.â€”The arcuate fibres, or fibrse proprise are situated immediately within the inner sur- face of the cortex, and connect the grey matter of adjacent convolutions in the same hemisphere. The fasciculus undnatus passes across the Sylvian fissure, traverses the claustrum and nucleus amygdalae, and connects the convolutions of the orbital surface of the frontal with those of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The cingulum or fillet of the gyrus fornicatus extends longitudinally, partly on the surface and partly within the gyrus fornicatus, from the anterior perforated spot to the gyrus uncinatus. Some of the fibres lie on the surface of the corpus callosum and form its longitudinal fibres, nerves of Lancisi, taenia tecta, and form the white reticular surface of the gyrus hippocampi.

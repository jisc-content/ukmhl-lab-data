136 ANATOMY. contain a colloid substance; their nucleus surrounded by a little protoplasm is near the attached end of the cell. Short replacement cells which do not reach the surface, lie between the attached ends of the columnar epithelium cells, in localities where these form only a single layer. Ciliated epithelium is situated on the nasal mucous membrane, and its prolongations into the cranial air- sinuses, into the nasal duct and lachrymal sac, into the Eustachian tube and tympanum, and the nasal part of the pharynx ; on the free surface of the mucous membrane of the windpipe as far as the terminal branches of the bronchial tubes; on the mucous surface of the uterus and Fallopian tubes; on the mucous lining of the commence- ment of the vas deferens, and on the lining membrane of the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord. It consists of columnar cells, which have at their free or basal ends extremely slender, soft, pellucid, hair like processes, or cilia. Beale states that the soft bioplasm (protoplasm) of the body of the cell is prolonged along the axis of each cilium, whilst the peri- phery possesses the firmer consistence of formed or differen- tiated material, but Klein regards the cilia as prolongations of the fibrils of the intra-cellular network. During life these cilia move rapidly to and fro in the fluid which moistens the surface of the membrane on which this form of epithelium is situated. In the human body the cilia are not more than from .L d^th to xuVo^1 inch in length ; but in various marine invertebrata they arc both longer and stronger. Sometimes, as in the lining membrane of the cerebral ventricles and on the inner surface of the Fig. 32.â€”Ciliated Epithe- lial Ceils.

237 SPINAL NEEVES. infra-spinatus; a 'posterior thoracic branch from the 5th and 6th to the serratus magnus; two anterior thoracic branches, one from the outer and one from the inner cord, to the pectoralis major and minor; three subscapular branches, from the posterior cord to the subscapularis, teres major and latissimus dorsi. The Cutaneous branches arise from the inner cord, and are the lesser internal cutaneous, which ends in the skin of the inner side of the upper arm, and joins the intercosto-humeral; and the internal cutaneous, which sends branches to the skin of the upper arm, and supplies the skin of the inner side of the forearm, both on its anterior and posterior surfaces. The Mixed branches are large and very important:â€”a, The Circumflex, from the posterior cord, supplies muscular branches to the deltoid and teres minor, a cutaneous branch to the skin over the deltoid, and an articular branch to the shoulder-joint, b, The Musculo-Spiral, which continues downwards the posterior cord, supplies muscular branches to the triceps, anconeus, supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior; by its internal cutaneous branch the skin of the back of the upper arm, and by its external cutaneous branch, the skin of the outer side of the back of the forearm. It then divides into the radial and posterior interosseous branches. The Radial passes down the fore- arm to the hand, and supplies the skin on the back of the thumb, index and middle digits, and radial side of the ring digit. The Posterior Interosseous pierces the supina- tor radii brevis, supplies the muscles on the back o'f the forearm and the carpal articulations, c, The Musculo- Cutaneous branch of the outer cord supplies the biceps, brachialis anticus, and coraco-brachialis, and ends in an external cutaneous branch, which supplies the skin of the

ANATOMY. 064 layers. Small racemose glands, similar to the mucous glands of the mouth, or to Brunner’s glands, lie beneath the mucous membrane, which is pierced by their ducts to open on the surface (fig. 180) : they are most numerous Fig. 180.—Vertical section through the mucous membrane of the Pharynx to show the racemose glands, e, the epithelium: ct% subjacent connective tissue; <7, racemose gland; d, its duct; a, artery ending in a capillary plexus on the gland vesicles, x 40. in the nasal part of the pharynx. Collections of lymphoid tissue are found in the sub-epithelial connective tissue, more especially in the nasal part of the pharynx, where it forms a mass, extending across the posterior and upper wall, between the openings of the two Eustachian tubes, which Luschka has called the 'pharyngeal tonsil. A net- work of lymphatic vessels exists both in the submucous coat, where it lies in relation to the lymphoid tissue, and between the tunica pharyngis externa and muscular coat; lymphatic glands are in connection with the latter part of the network. The arteries of the pharynx are derived

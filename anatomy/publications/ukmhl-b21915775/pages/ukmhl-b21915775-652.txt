ANATOMY. 636 tween them: the muscular layer is between the cartilaginous plates and the mucous membrane: it disappears in the lobular bronchi, where they form the lobular passages. The circular arrangement of the muscular tissue around the wall of the bronchi enables it to constrict these tubes, and modify the ingress of air into, and its egress from the air-vesicles. The submucous coat contains longitudinal bundles of elastic tissue continuous with those in the trachea ; they diminish in size and distinctness in the smaller bronchi ; but elastic tissue can be traced in the walls not only of the terminal branches of the lobular bronchial tubes, but in the walls of the air-vesicles. The presence of longitudinal bundles of elastic tissue in the walls of the bronchi and trachea enables these tubes to be elongated, and to recoil to their former dimensions when the tension is removed. Eacemose glands lie outside the muscular layer, between it and the bronchial cartilage : slender ducts proceed from them, which pierce the muscular layer, and open on the free surface of the mucous membrane. Collections of lymphoid tissue are situated in the connective tissue immediately external to the muscular layer. The mucous membrane lines the interior of the bronchi. It is covered on its free surface with a layer of ciliated columnar epithelium, amidst which goblet-shaped cells are scattered : the ciliated epithelium disappears in the lobular bronchi, when they begin to form the air-vesicles, and is replaced by a tesselated epithelium. The terminal branches of a lobular bronchial tube lose the cylindrical form of the bronchus, and dilate both late- rally and terminally into the alveoli, or air-vesicles. The collection of air-vesicles surrounding any given terminal bronchus is called a 'primary lobule, or an infundibulum

104 ANATOMY. made to lean forward, then the capsular ligament is no longer tense, and the gluteal and hamstring muscles are put in action to re-extend the trunk on the thigh, and prevent it from falling forward. Disturbance of the equilibrium in the transverse direction, as in falling to one side, is checked by the tension of the ligamentum teres, the pubo-femoral and ischio-femoral bands of the capsular ligament, and the strong ilio-tibial band of the fascia lata of the thigh, which stretches from the iliac crest to the external tuberosity of the tibia. The ligamentum J teres is tightened when the joint is adducted and rotated,- so that it checks rotation of the trunk on the thigh, when standing momentarily on one leg in the act of walking. When, in standing erect either on one or both feet, the balance of the body is disturbed, then various muscles both of the trunk and lower limb are brought into action to assist in preserving the erect position. The Knee is the largest and most complicated joint in the body. The bones are the femur, tibia, and patella. The patella moves up and down the trochlear surface of the femur, whilst the condyles of the femur roll upon the semilunar cartilages and articular surfaces of the tibia. The joint is invested by a strong ligament in which occur the following bands : external lateral from head of fibula to outer tuberosity of femur : the internal lateral from inner tuberosity of tibia to inner tuberosity of femur; the 'posterior from inner tuberosity of tibia to outer condyle of femur; the anterior, which is also the tendon of insertion of the extensors of the leg, from the patella to the anterior tuberosity of tibia. Within the investing ligament the anterior and posterior inter-articular or crucial ligaments pass from the inter-condyloid fossa to the upper surface of

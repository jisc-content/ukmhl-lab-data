248 ANATOMY. with its multipolar nerve cells, takes place. The posterior cornu alters in its shape, becomes constricted at its neck, expands at its periphery and forms in the lower part of the medulla three grey masses; one in the clava of the posterior pyramid is the â€˜posterior pyramidal ganglion of Clarke; another in the funiculus cuneatus is the restiform nucleus, or the tuberculum cuneatum of Schwalbe; the third in the funiculus Rolandi is the tubercle of Rolando (tig. 79). Higher up in the medulla this grey matter appears on the floor of the 4th ventricle near its lateral boundary and forms the nuclei of origin of the 8th and auditory nerves. The grey matter of the anterior cornu and intermedio-lateral group is very materially modified by the passage through it of the crossed pyramidal tract of the lateral column of the cord on its way from the decussation of the anterior pyramids. This grey matter is to a large extent intersected by these fibres and is broken up into the grey formatio reticularis, in the meshes of which network scattered nerve cells are situated. A portion of the grey matter at the periphery of the cornu remains for a time as a compact mass and forms the antero-lateral nucleus of Dean (fig. 79 ac). Another portion forms small collections of nerve cells situated on the anterior and inner aspect of the anterior pyramid, under cover of the external arciform fibres; these are the nuclei arciformes, the most anterior of which is the anterior pyramidal nucleus of Kolliker. A third part of the anterior cornu appears as a compact mass on the floor of the 4th ventricle close to the median longitudinal fissure, and forms the nucleus of origin of the 9th cranial nerve. In the interior of the olive a mass of grey matter, contain- ing multipolar flask-shaped cells, is folded in a zig-zag manner and forms the corpus dentatum or nucleus of the

ANATOMY. 728 whilst the posterior part contains a slender fibrous cord formed by the obliteration of a vein of the foetus, named ductus venosus. - The longitudinal fissure is often bridged across by a band of liver substance called pons hepatis. The under surface of the left lobe is smooth, and overlaps the anterior surface of the stomach. The under surface of Fig. 197.â€”Under surface of the Liver. R. right, L, left lobe; Q, lobus quad- ratus; S, lobus Spigelii; C, lobus caudatus; p, pons hepatis; If, longitudinal fissure; t, transverse fissure; cf, caudate fissure; ti/, fossa for vena cava; kf fossa for right kidney; G, gall bladder in its fossa; u, obliterated umbilical vein; v, obliterated ductus venosus; IV, inferior vena cava; h,h, hepatic veins; p, portal vein; A, hepatic artery; D, bile duct; c, coronary ligament; II and rl, left and right lateral ligaments; S, suspensory ligament; r, round ligament. the right lobe is divided into smaller lobes by fissures and fossae. Starting from about the middle of the longitudinal fissure is the portal or transverse fissure, which extends for from three to four inches across the under surface of the right lobe. It is the gate [porta) of the liver, the lulus or fissure of entrance into the organ of the portal vein,

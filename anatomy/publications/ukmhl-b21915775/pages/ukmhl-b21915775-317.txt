WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN. 301 The average weight of the adult European male brain is 49 to 50 oz. (about 3 lbs.), that of the adult female 44 to 45 oz.; so that the brain of a man is on the average fully 10 per cent, heavier than that of a woman. The greater weight of the brain in man as compared with woman is not in relation merely to his greater bulk, but is a funda- mental sexual distinction ; for, whilst there is a difference of 10 per cent, in the brain weight, the average stature of women is, according to Thumam’s calculations, only 8 per cent, less than that of men. Dr Boyd states that the average weight of the brain in the newly bom male infant is 11 ‘67 oz.; in the female only 10 oz. The exact age at which the brain reaches its maximum size has been variously placed at from the 3d to the 8th years by different authors ; but it continues to increase in weight to 25 or 30, or as some say even to 40. After 60 the brain begins to diminish in weight ; in aged males the average weight is about 45 oz., in females about 41 oz. In some cases the adult brain considerably exceeds the average weight. The brains of several men distinguished for their intellectual attainments have been weighed : the brain of Cuvier weighed 64| oz.; of Dr Abercrombie, 63 oz.; of Professor Goodsir, 571 oz.; of Spurz- heim, 55 oz.; of Sir J. Y. Simpson, 54 oz.; of Agassiz, 53'4 oz.; and of Dr Chalmers, 53 oz. But high brain weights have also been found where there was no evidence of great intellectual capacity. Peacock weighed four male brains which ranged from 62‘75 to 61 oz.; Boyd, a specimen of 60 "75 oz.; and I have in my possession one of a boy of 15, which weighed 60 oz. In the brains of the insane high brain weights have also been observed. Bucknill met with a brain in a male epileptic which weighed 641 oz.; Thurnam, one which weighed 62 oz.; and in the cases examined in the West Riding Asylum, under the super- intendence of Dr Crichton Browne, out of 375 males, the weight of the brain in 30 cases was 55 oz. or upwards, and the highest weights were 61 oz. in a case of senile dementia, 601 oz- i-11 a case of dementia, and 60 oz. in one of melancholia. No case has as yet been recorded of the weight of the brain in a woman of great intellectual attainments ; but Boyd met with a woman’s brain as high as 55 ■'25 oz., and many instances of upwards of 50 oz. in women where there was no evidence of high mental endowment. Skae observed in a female monomaniac, a brain which weighed 611 oz-5 and of 300 females examined in the West Riding Asylum the weight of the brain in 26 cases was 50 oz. or upwards, the highest weights being 56 and 55 oz. in two cases of mania. The size and weight of the brain do not, therefore, per se, give an exact method of estimating the intellectual power of the indi- vidual, and a high brain weight and great intellectual capacity are not necessarily correlated with each other. For it must be remembered that the brain is not only the organ of the mind, but a great centre of

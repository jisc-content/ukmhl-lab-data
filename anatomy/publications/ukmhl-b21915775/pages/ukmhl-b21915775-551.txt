535 LYMPHATICS OF THORAX. the face; deep lymphatics proceed from the pia mater and arachnoid membrane and leave the skull along with the internal jugular vein. In the neck superficial lymphatics are placed beneath the skin, and deep lymphatics proceed from the pharynx, larynx, tongue, &c. The lymphatics, both of the head and neck, converge towards the region of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and communicate with numer- ous cervical lymphatic glands arranged so as to form a chain connected by interglandular lymph-vessels, and termed the glandtdce concatinatce. These glands lie under cover of the sterno-mastoid, and from their lower ends lymph-vessels proceed which join on the right side the right lymphatic duct; on the left side the thoracic duct. Lymphatic glands occur in the submaxillary region, also superficial to the parotid gland, and in close relation to the occipital artery, where it pierces the trapezius to reach the back of the scalp. The Lymphatics of the Thorax are situated in both- the thoracic walls and in the viscera. The superficial lymphatics of the walls pass, as already stated, into the axilla, to enter the axillary glands. The deep lymphatics of the walls accompany the internal mammary and inter- costal arteries, and in their course pass through lymphatic glands. Those which accompany the internal mammary arteries are in connection with the sternal or anterior mediastinal glands, and end on the right side in the right lymphatic duct, on the left side in the thoracic duct. Those which accompany the series both of right and left intercostal arteries end in the thoracic duct. The Lymphatics of the Lungs form a superficial set

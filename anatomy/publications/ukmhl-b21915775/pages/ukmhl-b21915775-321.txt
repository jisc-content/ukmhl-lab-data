305 ENCEPHALIC NEEVES. Second group.—Motor nerves: a, oculo-motor, the principal nerve of supply for the muscles of the eyeball: b, trochlear, the nerve for the superior oblique muscle: c, abducent, the nerve for the external rectus: d, portio dura, the nerve for the facial muscles of expression : e, spinal accessory, the nerve which gives a motor root to the pneumogastric, and supplies the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles: /, hypoglossal, the nerve for the muscles of the tongue. Third group.—Mixed nerves : a, trifacial, distributed to the muscles of mastication, the skin and mucous mem- branes of the face, and to the antero-lateral surfaces of the tongue : b, glosso-pharyngeal, distributed to the pharynx, to certain palato-pharyngeal muscles, and to the mucous membrane of the back of the tongue, where it acts as a nerve of the special sense of taste : c, the pneumogastric, conjoined with the internal division of the spinal accessory, is distributed to the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, larynx, lungs and heart. The 1st and 2d cranial nerves arise primarily from the anterior cerebral vesicle ; the 3d and 4th from the middle cerebral vesicle and the remainder from the posterior cerebral vesicle. The consideration of the First group of cranial nerves may appro- priately be deferred until the organs of sense, in which they terminate, are described. The anatomy of the Motor Nerves is as follows :— The Oculo-motor or 3d nerve springs out of the inner surface of the crus cerebri. Its root fibres pass amidst the nerve cells of the locus niger, and reach the group of nerve cells situated in the corpora quadrigemina below the aqueduct of Sylvius. The nerve runs forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, divides into an upper and a lower branch, and enters the orbit through the u

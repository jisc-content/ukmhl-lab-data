ANATOMY. 600 cartilage upwards and backwards, but owing to the attach- ment of some fibres to the vocal cord, local tension may be given to certain parts of it. The fibres attached to the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage may roll it inwards so as to bring the two cords together, and narrow the rima glottidis. The width of the rima glottidis is altered by the move- ments of the arytenoid cartilages, which rotate about a vertical axis passing through the crico-arytenoid joints. The cartilages are rotated outwards, the vocal processes and vocal cords are separated from each other, and the rima glottidis is widened by the pair of Posterior crico-arytenoid muscles, which arise from the depressed surfaces on the back of the cricoid cartilage (fig. 161), and pass upwards and outwards to be inserted into the external or muscular process at the base of each arytenoid cartilage.* The arytenoid cartilages are rotated inwards, the vocal cords are approximated, and the vocal part of the rima glottidis is narrowed by the pair of Lateral crico-arytenoid muscles, which, being under cover of the sides of the thyroid cartilage, arise from the upper border of the side of the cricoid, pass backwards and upwards to be inserted into the external or muscular process at the base of each arytenoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages are drawn together, and the width of the respiratory part of the rima glottidis is narrowed, by the single * Merkel described a small Kerato-cricoid muscle as occasionally ex- tending, but on one side only, from the lower part of the back of the cri- coid cartilage to the inferior cornu of the thyroid. I found it to be pre- sent 7 times in 32 subjects, and to be occasionally present on both sides.

ANATOMY, 83G PAR-0 VARIUM. The Par-o varium, or Organ of Kosenmiiller, is a small body situated between the two layers of the broad liga- ment in the interval between the ovary and the Fallopian tube. It consists of a group of short convoluted tubules, from twelve to twenty in number, arranged in a radiated manner, with the base towards the Fallopian tube, and with the apex towards the ovary, but having no connec- tion with either structure (fig. 231). At the base a longi- tudinal tube often unites the convoluted tubes together. This longitudinal tube is developed in the sheep, cow, and pig into a canal, which extends along the side wall of the uterus and vagina to open near the orifice of the urethra, where it is named the canal or duct of Gaertner. The tubes of the par-ovarium are lined by epithelium. FALLOPIAN TUBES. The Fallopian tubes, or Oviducts, are not anatomically continuous with the ovaries, but are intimately connected with the super o-lateral angles of the uterus. They are two in number, and are placed one along the upper free border of each broad ligament. Each oviduct is from 3 to 4 inches long; at its uterine or attached end it is slender and cord-like, but it expands towards its outer or free end, and terminates in a number of delicate processes or fimbricE, one of which is often attached to the surface of the ovary. These fimbriae surround the mouth of the oviduct, which, though constricted at the orifice, opens into the wide, trumpet-shaped outer end of the tube.

188 ANATOMY. nerve centre, so as to induce in it tlie molecular changes which give rise to the sensation of touch, are nerves of common sensation; those which arise in the end-organs in the eye, ear, nose, and tongue, and induce in their appropriate nerve centres the sensations of sight, sound, smell, and taste, are nerves of special sense; whilst nerves which conduct impulses from peripheral end-organs to a nerve centre, and, instead of inducing in the latter a sensation, have the impulses reflected to other nerves, are reflex nerves. When the impulses are reflected to motor nerves, they are excito-motory ; to secretory nerves, excito-secretory ; to inhibitory nerves, excito-inliibitory. In some fishes which possess electrical organs, nerves, named electric nerves, conduct impulses to, and set in activity the batteries from which electrical shocks are discharged. The nerve centres, nerves, and peripheral end-organs form two groups or systemsâ€”a Cerebro-spinal and a Sympa- thetic. The Cerebro-spinal nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord, of the nerves which arise from or ter- minate in these large centres, of the small ganglia connected with these nerves, and of the end-organs at their peripheral terminations. The Sympathetic nervous system consists of the sympathetic ganglia, with their nerves and end-organs. Nervous Tissue. The several parts of the nervous system are not uniform in colour, some being white, others grey. The nerves, at least those of the cerebro-spinal system, are invariably white, and white masses, variable in size, are met with in the brain and spinal cord ; they constitute the white matter of the nervous system. In the nerve centres, both of the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems, grey matter is

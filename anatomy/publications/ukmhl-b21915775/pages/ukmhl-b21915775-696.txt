After enclosing it, they again come together, and pass backwards to the spine as the transverse meso-colon.* The two layers of the transverse meso-colon then separate from each other. The one ascends in front of the panci-eas to the diaphragm, where it becomes continuous with tbe posterior layer of the coronary and left lateral ligaments of the liver. The other descends as the anterior layer of the mesentery, reaches the coils of the jejunum and ileum, is prolonged around the wall of the gut, and then ascends to the spine, as the 'posterior layer of the mesentery. The line of attachment of the two layers of the mesentery to the front of the spine is called the root of the mesentery. From this line the peritoneum spreads out laterally; on the right side of the abdomen it covers the anterior and lateral surfaces of the coecum and ascending colon, but not the posterior surface; on the left side of the abdomen it has a similar relation to the descending colon, but it forms a complete investment for the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and is reflected to the left iliac fossa as the sigmoid meso-colon. From the root of the mesentery the posterior layer * This account of the relation of the omentum to the transverse colon and meso-colon is in conformity with the arrangement one sees in the adult body, and accords witli the description usually found in the text books. But it should be stated, that observations have been made by various anatomists which prove that, in the foetus, the transverse meso- colon is a fold of the peritoneum quite distinct from the ascending layers of the great omentum, and that the arrangement seen in the adult is due to a secondary fusion of these peritoneal folds with each other.

ANATOMY OF THE TEXTURES OR TISSUES. 115 properties as living structures. It would be out of place in this work to enter into a discussion of the meaning of the term Life, or Living, or to attempt an analysis of the various definitions of the term which have been suggested from time to time by different philosophers. It will suffice for our present purpose to adopt the old Aristotelian definition, and to speak of Life as the faculties of self- nourishment, self-growth, and self-decay. All the tissues, over and above the special properties which they possess, have therefore the power of growing, and of maintaining themselves in full structural perfection and functional activity for a given period of time. After a time they begin to exhibit signs of diminished perfection and activity, they degenerate or decay ; ultimately they die, and the entire organism, of which they form the constituent parts, is resolved by the putrefactive process into more simple forms of matter. General Considerations on Cells. The simplest form of organic matter capable of exhibiting the phenomena of life is a nitrogenous compound (proteid) called Cyto-blastema or Protoplasm. It is viscous or jelly- like, colourless, translucent, and granulated. The granules express a very minute intra-protoplasmic network of very delicate fibrils, in the meshes of which is a homogeneous sub- stance. Protoplasm assimilates nutriment, grows, reproduces its kind, moves and responds to stimuli. It enters in a very important manner into the structure of the bodies of the lower animals. The elongated processes, or pseudopodia, to which Dujardin applied the name of sarcode, which the Pihizopoda can project from their surface into the surround- ing medium, and again withdraw into their substance,

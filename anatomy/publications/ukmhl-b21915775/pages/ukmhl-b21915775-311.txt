INTERNAL STRUCTURE OE THE CEREBRUM. 295 of the paracentral, ascending frontal and parietal convolu- tions ; it forms some of the fibres of the corona radiata and inner capsule of the corpus striatum, also the peduncular fibres of the crusta of the crus cerebri, the longitudinal pyramidal fibres of the pons, the anterior pyramids of the medulla oblongata, the direct pyramidal tract of the anterior column, and the crossed pyramidal tract of the lateral column of the cord. The motor tract leaves the cord as the anterior nerve roots on the side opposite to the hemisphere in which the fibres arise, and terminates in the motorial end plates of the muscular apparatus. The tegmentum forms the posterior or deeper part of the crus cerebri, and is separated from the crusta by the locus niger. It lies between the locus niger and the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius. Schwalbe pro- poses to extend the term tegmentum so as to include also the subthalamic region, and the parts of the medulla and pons situated between the floor of the 4th ventricle and the anterior pyramidal or peduncular fibres. The term would therefore comprise the nuclei of the cranial nerves from the 3d to the 9th inclusive, the olives, the corpus subthalamicum, the raphe of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon, the formatio reticularis in these regions, the fasciculus teres, the lemniscus, superior peduncles of cerebellum, and posterior longitudinal fasciculus. The pos- terior longitudinal fasciculus lies next the mesial plane, in the dorsal part of the formatio reticularis, between the lemniscus and the aqueduct of Sylvius. It arises in the medulla oblongata from the basis bundle of the anterior column and can be traced upwards as high as the posterior commissure, where its termination is doubtful. The longitudinal fibres of the formatio reticularis, the fasciculus

ANATOMY. 13S membrana propria, and consists of flattened endothelial cells. Deeper than this membrane is a delicate con- nective tissue in which Ithe blood and lymph vessels and the nerves of the gland ramify. The anatomical structures necessary for secretion are cells, blood-vessels, lymph-vessels, and nerves. The blood-vessels convey the blood from which the secretion has to be derived; the cells, as Goodsir showed by a variety of proofs, are the active agents in separating the secretion from the blood; the nerves regulate the size of the blood-vessels and there- fore the amount of blood which circulates through the gland, and also exercise some direct influence on the activity of the cells. The function of the lymph-vessels is not so well understood, but the researches of Ludwig and of some of his pupils have shown their relation to the secreting structure of several glands. The connective tissue and the membrana propria are merely supporting structures for the cells, vessels, and nerves. All secreting glands have the same general type of structure, though they differ from each other, as will be pointed out when the individual glands are described, in the degree of complexity in which their constituent parts are arranged. The simplest form of gland is a short tube, or follicle closed at its deep end, whilst the opposite end has a mouth opening on a free surface, as in the tubular glands of the intestine; but in other cases the tube may branch at its deep end, as in the glands of the stomach ; or it may become greatly elongated and rolled into a ball, as in the sweat glands; or it may branch, and the branches may form coils and loops, as in the kidney; or the tube may branch, and the branches may dilate into sac-like expansions, gland-vesicles, follicles, or acini, as in the compound racemose group of glands, of

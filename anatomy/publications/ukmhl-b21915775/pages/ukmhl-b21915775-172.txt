ANATOMY. 156 whilst the remaining portion continues as cartilage throughout life, and is termed 'permanent. The following varieties of cartilage, based on modifications in structure and appearance, may be recognized :— Cellular cartilage. Cells with matrix substance. r ' 7^ Matrix homogeneous. Matrix fibrous. (Hyaline cartilage.) (Fibro-cartilage.) r K > White fibro-cartilage. Yellow fibro-cartilage. The Cellular or Parenchymatous Cartilage does not exist in the adult human body, but is found in that of some of the smaller mammals. Thus the cartilaginous framework of the ear of the mouse, the bat, and the rat, is formed of cellular cartilage, the cells of which Fic. 47.—Cells of the Chorda Dorsalis Fig. 48.—Cells of the Cartilaginous of the Lamprey. Framework of the ear of the Mouse. are irregularly polygonal, and packed together so closely that the intercellular matrix is scarcely to be recognized. It is customary also to regard the chorda dorsalis or notochord, the axial rod around which the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs are developed, as formed of cellular cartilage. In all the higher vertebrata the choi’da dorsalis disappears as development advances, but in the lower vertebrates it persists throughout life as a

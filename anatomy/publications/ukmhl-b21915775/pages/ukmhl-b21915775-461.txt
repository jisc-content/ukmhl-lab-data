BRACHIAL ARTERY. 445 ... A. and superior profunda artery, whilst lower down it rests on the tendon of insertion of the coraco-brachialis, and on the brachialis anticus muscle. At first the coraco-brachialis, and then the inner border of the biceps, are to its outer side, and in muscular arms it is overlapped by the latter muscle, the inner border of which forms a definite guide to the position of the artery. It is accompanied by two venae comites; and the basilic vein, separated by the brachial aponeurosis, is superficial to it, whilst at the bend of the elbow the median basilic vein is separated from it by the thin tendon of the biceps. The median nerve is at first to its outer side, then crosses over it, but at and immediately above the bend of the elbow it is to its inner side. Not unfrequently the brachial artery divides into the radial and ulnar arteries in the upper arm, and the division may in some cases take place as high as the axilla. In those instances in which a supra-condyloid process and fora- men are developed (p. 41), the brachial artery and median nerve are deflected from their usual course to pass through the foramen, though occasionally the foramen only transmits the median nerve. The branches of the brachial artery are as follows :â€” a. Muscular branches pass outwards from the brachial artery to supply the biceps, coraco-brachialis, and brachialis anticus muscles. b. Superior Profunda arises from the upper portion of the brachial; it winds downwards, backwards, and out- wards, along with the musculo-spiral nerve in the musculo- spiral groove of the humerus, passes between the heads of the triceps, then pierces the external inter-muscular septum of the upper arm to reach the interval between the

CELLS PLACED INTERSTITIALLY IN A MATRIX. 143 layer of polygonal, tessellated, squamous cells, on the inner surface of the vascular connective tissue of the synovial capsules. Hiiter and Reylier state that the cells do not form a continuous layer, but only occur in patches, and that between these patches the connective tissue forms the free surface. Tillmanns, however, asserts that the endo- thelial cells form a continuous layer. Villous processes of the sub-endothelial vascular connective tissue called synovial fringes, covered by endothelium, project into the cavities of joints and synovial burste, and contribute to the forma- tion of the synovia which lubricates the surface of a synovial membrane. Development of Endothelium. Endothelium is developed exclusively from the cells of the mesoblast, from which cells also are formed by histological differentiation, the organs to which the endothelium serves as a covering or lining. Between the endothelium and the connective tissue a close genetic co- relationship obviously exists, as the plasma canals between the bundles of connective tissue are lined by flattened endothelial-like cells. THIRD GROUP OF TISSUES. Cells placed Interstitially in a Matrix. The tissues which are constructed on this plan are of great importance, and constitute by far the larger propor- tion of the tissues not only of the human body, but of the bodies of animals generally. Sometimes these tissues are elongated into delicate threads or fibres, at other times they are expanded into thin membranes, at others they form solid masses of considerable thickness. The matrix sub- stance varies in its character in the different tissues, and sometimes is so abundant as to obscure the cells.

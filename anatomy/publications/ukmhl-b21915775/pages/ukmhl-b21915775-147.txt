CELLS ARRANGED ON FREE SURFACES. 131 walls of the small intestine. The lacteals join the lymph atics at the back of the abdomen to form the thoracic duct in which the lymph and chyle become mingled together. The chyle contains corpuscles similar to the lymph cor- puscles, which are apparently derived from the lymph glands in the mesentery, through which the chyle flows on its way to the thoracic duct. The fluid of the lymph, the chyle, and the blood, in which the corpuscles are suspended, is sometimes described as a fluid intercellular substance. Corpuscles possessing the type of structure of the lymph corpuscles, are named lymphoid cells or leucocytes. Cells are also met with floating free in the Secretions formed in the interior of some of the glands. They are more particularly found in the secretion of mucus from the mucous glands, and of saliva from the salivary glands (fig. 33, B). They are round, colourless, nucleated corpuscles, like leucocytes, and are either formed in the glands, or are migrated white blood corpuscles. SECOND GROUP OF TISSUES. Cells Arranged on Free Surfaces. By the term Free Surface is meant a surface which is not blended with or attached to adjacent structures, but is free or separable from them without dissection. Every free surface is covered by one or more layers of cells. It has been customary to name these cells Epithelium, aud to speak of a simple or a stratified epithelium, according as the cells are arranged in one or in several layers. But it h is been suggested by His that the cells lining the inner surface of the wall of the vascular and serous canals an

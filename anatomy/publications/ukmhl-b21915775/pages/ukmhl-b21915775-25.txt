AXIAL SKELETON—SPINE. 9 iu addition to the proper endo-skeleton, skeletal plates are developed in connection with the integument, so that they possess a dermo-skeleton likewise. In some vertebrates, also, a partial skeleton is formed within the substance of some of the viscera—e.g., in ruminant animals a bone is situated in the heart; in the walrus and other carnivora, in rodents, bats, and some monkeys, a bone lies in the penis ; and in the leopard, jackal, and other carnivora, a cartilagin- ous style lies in the middle of the tongue. These parts form a splanchno- or visceral skeleton. The cartilaginous framework of the windpipe may also be referred to the splanchno-skeleton, and the teeth to the dermo-skeleton, and in these respects man possesses representatives of both the exo- and splanchno-skeleton, though like other verte- brates his skeleton is chiefly an endo-skeleton. In each of the great divisions of the body an endo- skeleton exists, so that we may speak of an Axial Skeleton and an Appendicular Skeleton. The Axial Skeleton consists of the bones of the spine and head, the ribs, and the breastbone; the Appendicular Skeleton, of the bones of the limbs. The number of bones in the skeleton varies at different periods of life. In the adult there are about 210, but in the child they are more numerous; for in the process of consolidation of the skeleton certain bones originally distinct become fused together. Axial Skeleton, spine. The Spine, Spinal or Vertebral Column, chine, or backbone, consists of a number of superimposed bones which are named Vertebrae, because they can move or turn somewhat on each other. It lies in the middle of the back

866 ANATOMY. of the alimentary tube. The small vesicular outgrowth, named the allantois, rapidly increases in size, grows into the space between the umbilical vesicle, amnion and sub- zonal membrane, and becomes more or less intimately united with these structures, but more especially with the sub-zonal membrane, and its extra-abdominal part forms a dilated bag, the sac of the allantois, which contains the allantoic fluid. This sac keeps up its continuity with the urinary bladder by a slender tubular stalk, the urachus, which passes through the abdominal wall at the umbilicus. The wall of the sac of the allantois, having reached the inner surface of the sub-zonal membrane, spreads itself over the whole, or a great part of that surface, and forms the inner layer of the permanent chorion. The allantois is lined by an epithelium continuous with the hypoblast epithelial lining of the intestine, whilst external to the epithelium is a layer of connective tissue, continuous with and derived from the splanchno-pleure layer of the meso- blast. In this connective-tissue layer blood-vessels are developed, which are continuous with the abdominal ves- sels of the embryo. When the sac of the allantois reaches the sub-zonal, or external, layer of the permanent chorion, the blood-vessels are necessarily brought there at the same time, and, as the allantois grows to form the inner layer of the chorion, its blood-vessels become the vessels of the permanent chorion, or the vessels of the foetal placenta. These vessels increase in size and numbers with the growth of the chorion, their trunks become the umbilical arteries and vein, they enter into the formation of the umbilical cord, and pass into the abdominal cavity, at the umbilicus, to join the aorta and inferior vena cava.

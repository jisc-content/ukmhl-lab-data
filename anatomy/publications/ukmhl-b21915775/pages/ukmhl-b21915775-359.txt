THE EYEBALL. 343 The Inner or Nervous Tunic. The Retina is the delicate nervous coat of the eyeball which lies immediately internal to the choroid, and extends from the place of entrance of the optic nerve as far forward as the ciliary processes, where it forms a jagged border, the ora serrata. In the living eye it is translucent and of a purple-red colour, but shortly after death it becomes grey: it is soft and so easily torn that it is difficult to display it in a dissection without injury. Its inner or anterior surface, concave forwards, is moulded on the vitreous body, and presents the following appearances :— Almost exactly in the antero-posterior axis of the eyeball is a transversely oval yellow spot {macula lutea), about J^th inch in its long diameter, which amongst mammals is found only in man and apes, though, as Knox and Hulke have shown, it exists in reptiles ; in the centre of this spot is a depression, the fovea centralis; about |-th inch to the inner side of the yellow spot is a slight elevation, the papilla optica, which marks the disc-like entrance of the optic nerve into the retina; here the fibres of the nerve radiate outwards and forwards to the ora serrata, and branches of the arteria centralis retinae accompany them. The retina is highly complex in structure, and consists of nerve fibres and cells, of peripheral end-organs, of con- nective tissue, and of blood-vessels, arranged in several layers. Max Schultze, the chief authority on the subject, recognised ten layers, and included among these the layer of pigment cells up to that time described as the inner pigmentary layer of the choroid. These layers are, from before backwards, as follows:—(1) membrana limitans interna; (2) layer of optic nerve fibres; (3) layer of ganglion cells; (4) internal molecular or granulated layer; (5) internal granule or nuclear layer; (6) external molecular

ORIGIN OF LYMPHATICS. 541 Origin of the Lymphatic Vessels, The mode of origin of the lymphatic vessels is a difficult subject of study, and has long been a disputed question amongst anatomists. In the intestinal villi they are capillary tubes, which come apparently to a blind termi- nation near the free end of the villus, though some ob- servers have supposed that they are continuous with a minute network in the basis substance of the villus, and' through it with the deeper ends of the epithelial cells covering the villus. In the skin, the mucous and submucous tissues, the tendons, and other forms of connective tissue, lymph- capillaries form at their origin a compact polygonal network, which is apparently continuous with spaces in the connec- tive tissue, situated either between its bundles or surround- ing the connective tissue corpuscles. These spaces have been termed the juice or plasma canals; they are not vessels in the proper sense of the word, but, as it were, microscopic chinks in the tissue. They communicate freely with each other, and apparently with the lymph capillaries. It is an open question if these plasma passages possess any other boundary than that of the elements of the tissue in which they are situated, though some observers have described them as lined by a layer of endothelium. These plasma passages provide an arrange- ment by means of which the tissues can be permeated by a nutritive fluid derived from the liquor sanguinis, and afford room for the wandering colourless corpuscles which have migrated out of the blood-vessels. T. A. Carter has injected from the blood-vessels an extremely minute net-

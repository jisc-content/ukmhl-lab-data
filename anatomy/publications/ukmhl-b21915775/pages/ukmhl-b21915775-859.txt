UTERUS. 843 ridges, one on the anterior and the other on the posterior wall, to which a number of shorter ridges, directed obliquely downwards, converge, the whole forming an appearance known as the plicae palmate or arbor vitce. The epithelial covering of the mucous lining of the cervix is not at all times the same. Iu the virgin it consists of ciliated columnar cells, which extend as far as the os ex- ternum, where a squamous and stratified epithelium, like that of the vagina occurs. After the first pregnancy the ciliated epithelium is confined to the upper half or two- thirds of the cervical canal, whilst the lower part is lined with stratified squamous cells. In the lower part of the cervix vascular papillae project into the epithelium. Simple and bi'anchecl mucous follicles, lined by a ciliated columnar epithelium, open into the cervix, and in addition clear vesicles, filled with a yellowish fluid, and named the ovula Nabothi, are also found. In the pregnant uterus the glands of the cervix secrete a tenacious mucous, which plugs up the os and cervix. The mucous lining of the body of the uterus is smooth and thin, and so closely set on the muscular coat that a definite submucous coat can scarcely be said to exist. It is covered by a ciliated columnar epithelium, the cells of which are not very elongated. Numerous small openings exist on the free surface of the mucosa, which are the mouths of the utricular glands. When vertical sections are made through the uterine wall, the utricular glands are seen to be elongated tubes, which branch once or twice in the course of their extent. It is not unusual to see two neighbouring glands join close to the free surface of the mucosa, and open by a common aperture. The glands do

Sometimes these fibres consist solely of this fibrillated material, at other times they are invested by a sheath similar to the primitive membrane of a medullated fibre. Nuclei are also found both in the substance of the fibre and in relation with the primitive membrane. The presence of multitudes of fibres in the sympathetic nervous system, formed either entirely, or almost entirely, of a material precisely similar in structure to the axial cylinder of a medullated fibre, and by which the proper function of the fibre can alone, therefore, be exercised, is, of Fig. 64. — Non- ’ ’ ’ ’ medullated COurse, an additional argument to those pre- Nerve Fibres ’ from the sym- viously advanced, in favour of the existence pathetic sys- J ’ tem. 0f the axial cylinder as a normal constituent of the fibre, and of its functional importance. rClNerve Cells.—Nerve cells constitute an important division of the nervous tissue. They are the characteristic structures in the nerve centres, are susceptible to impres- sions, or nervous impulses, and are the texture in which the molecular changes occur that produce or disengage the special form of energy named nerve energy, the evolution of which is the distinctive mark of a nerve centre. It was at one time thought that nerve cells were globular in form ; but it is now known that, though the body of a cell is not unfrequently globular, one, two or more processes or poles project from it, and are continuous with its substance, and one or more of these processes are also continuous with a nerve fibre or fibres situated in relation to the nerve cell.

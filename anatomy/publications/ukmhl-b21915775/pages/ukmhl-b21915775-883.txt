PLACENTA. 867 There are thus four structures, of which one is developed at the periphery of the ovum, whilst the remaining three Fig. 234.â€”Diagram of the Foetal Membranes. Structures which either are, or have been at an earlier period of development, continuous with each other are represented by the same character of shading, pc, primitive chorion with its villi; sz, sub-zonal membrane; E, epiblast, or cuticuiar covering of embryo continuous with am, the amnion; M, mesoblast forming the bulk of the body of the embryo, and prolonged into the wall of the sac of the Allantois al, and into the wall of the Umbilical Vesicle UV.

The structureless zona, with its simple structureless villi, which together form the primitive chorion, very early dis-

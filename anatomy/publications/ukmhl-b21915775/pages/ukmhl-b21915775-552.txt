ANATOMY. 536 beneath the pleura, and a deep set accompanying the bronchus and the pulmonary blood-vessels. They pass from the lung at its root and enter the bronchial glands, which form a large cluster, both at the root of the lung and in the angle of bifurcation of the trachea. From the bronchial glands lymph-vessels proceed, which on the right side join the right lymphatic duct, on the left the thoracic duct. The Lymphatics of the Heart accompany the coronary blood-vessels, and form at the base of the heart a right and a left trunk, each of which ascends in relation to the trachea; the right to end in the right lymphatic duct, the left in the thoracic duct. In their course they pass through lymphatic glands. The Lymphatics of the (Esophagus are said to form only a single set, situated in the submucous coat; they leave the oesophagus and pass through lymphatic glands situated around the tube, and end in the thoracic duct. The Lymphatics of the Thymus gland are numerous in infancy and childhood, and have been traced by Astley Cooper into the internal jugular veins. The Lymphatics of the Abdomen are situated in both the abdominal walls and in the viscera. The superficial lymphatics of the anterior abdo- minal wall descend to join the inguinal lymphatic glands situated in the groin immediately below Poupartâ€™s ligament. The deep lymphatics of the wall run along with the internal and external iliac arteries and their branches;

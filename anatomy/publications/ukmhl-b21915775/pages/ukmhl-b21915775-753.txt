737 LIVER. ment of tlie cells is in rows or columns, and when sections are made through a lobule, transverse to the long axis of the central vein, the columns of cells are seen to converge from the periphery to the centre of the lobule, and to form a network. By many observers the cells are regarded as in contact with the intra-lobular capillaries, without the intervention of an intermediate membrane. By others, and more especially by Lionel Beale, the secreting cells are regarded as enclosed in a tubular net- work, the wall of which is formed by a basement mem- brane. Beale states that the diameter of the network is usually about roY0th of an inch in most mammals. Accord- ing to this view, the cells are not in direct contact with the capillary blood-vessels, but separated from them by the basement membrane. In some parts of the lobule Beale has been able to demonstrate the basement membrane as distinct from the wall of the capillaries, but usually they are incorporated together. At the periphery of the lobule the mem- brane becomes continuous with the wall of the interlobular duct. I have seen in the liver of the camel delicate bars of connective tissue, prolonged from the capsule of the lobule between the columns of secreting cells, so as to form a sustentacular tissue quite dis- tinct from the network of blood capillaries.

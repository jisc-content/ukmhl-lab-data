809 TESTIS. tliat give origin to the lymphatics of the testicle. The bundles of intertubular connective tissue are, according to Mihalkovics, invested by flat endothelial-like cells, and the chinks between these bundles are apparently the lymph-spaces. The wall of the vasa recta and rete testis also consists of flattened cells. The wall of the vasa efferentia is thicker and more highly differentiated, for it consists not only of connective tissue, but. of non-striped muscle, arranged both circularly and longitudinally. The wall of the epididymis possesses a similar structure. The tubuli seminiferi are occupied by cells. Before the period of puberty these cells are inactive : their pro- toplasm is granulated and possesses nuclei, but the out- lines of the individual cells are obscure, When the testicle is actively engaged in the secretion of semen, the contents of its tubes assume other characters, and give rise to the formation not only of the fluid part of the semen, but of the peculiar spermatic filaments or sper- matozoa. The spermatozoa are microscopic thread-like filaments from -g-jj-Qtk inch long. At one end the thread is dilated into an ovoid or pear-shaped body, about o^th inch long, called the head of the spermatozoon, whilst the rest of the structure forms the body and filamentous tail. The spermatozoa are developed within the specially modi- fied sperm cells or spermato-blasts, occupying the seminal tubes, the nuclei of which have greatly increased in num- bers. From the recent observations of Neumann and Krause, it would appear that the spermato-blasts consist of a network of nucleated protoplasm, in part attached to the wall of the seminal tube, and in part projecting into its 3 F

124 ANATOMY. FIRST GROUP OF TISSUES. Cells Suspended in Fluids. The fluids of the body in which cells or other minute- solid particles are suspended are the blood, the lymph, and the chyle. Sometimes cells are found floating in the secretions of glands. The Blood. The blood is the well-known red fluid which circulates throughout the blood-vascular system. As its general composition and properties have to be considered in physiological rather than in anatomical works, the solid particles only, which are suspended in the plasma or liqu&i- sanguinis, will be described here. If a drop of human blood be examined under the microscope, crowds of minute bodies, the blood corpuscles, or blood globules, may be seen in it. These present two different appearances, and are distinguished by the names of red and white blood corpuscles. The red corpuscles, which are by far the more numerous, are circular, biconcave, non-nucleated discs. Their average diameter is about rvjoo-th Â°f an inch, and their thickness about -|th of that measurement; hence they are not spheres, as the old name blood globules would imply. Single corpuscles have a faint fawn-coloured hue, but collectively they give to the blood its characteristic red colour, due to the presence in the corpuscles of hcemoglobin. Vierordt and Welcker have estimated that 5,000,000 red corpuscles are present in every cubic millimetre of healthy human blood, and Malassez computes the whole volume of blood to contain 22,500 thousand millions. The red corpuscles

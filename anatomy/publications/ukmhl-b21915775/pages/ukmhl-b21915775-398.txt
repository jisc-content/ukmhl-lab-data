The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which are dis- tributed to the back of the tongue, enter the circumvallate papillae, the outer wall of the surrounding trench, and the gustatory lamellae, and form a minute plexus, with groups of nerve cells interspersed in it, from which bundles both of medullated and non-medullated fibres pass to the base of the gustatory bulbs. It is believed that the finest non- medullated fibres are continuous with the central processes of the gustatory cells, which are therefore regarded as the peripheral end-organs of the nerve of taste, and by the excitation of these bodies gustative or taste sensations are produced. As the glosso-pharyngeal is the nerve distri- buted to the circumvallate papillae, where these gustatory bulbs are especially found, it is therefore the special nerve of taste. The gustatory bulbs are not penetrated by blood- vessels, but the vascular sub-epithelial tissue is prolonged upwards along the sides of the bulbs almost as far as the plane of the gustatory pore (fig. 112). Gustatory bulbs have also been described in the fungiform papillae, but it is not known if these are supplied by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. In these papillae the nerves have been described (Krause) as ending both in a pencil-like brush of non-medullated fibres, and in small end-bulbs. The linguhl branch of the 3d division of the 5th is distri- buted to the mucous membrane of the tip, sides, anterior part of the dorsum, and the under surface of the tongue. It sup- plies the compound filiform papillae, but its exact mode of ending in them has not been definitely ascertained. It is a nerve of common sensation, though some have also regarded it as a nerve of taste for the anterior part of the tongue. Distributed, in part at least, along with the

JOINTS AND MUSCLES OF AXIAL SKELETON. 79 acting together. Nodding forwards is due to the sterno- cleido-mastoidei and the recti antici majores and miuores. Nodding backwards is due to the recti postici majores and minores, the splenii capitis, complexi, and superior obliques. The transverse or lateral movements are due to the rectus lateralis and trachelo-mastoid of the same side. Rotation of the head takes place along with the atlas at the atlo- axoid joints, about the pivot-like odontoid process; rotation so that the face is turned to the right is due to the right splenius, right inferior oblique, right rectus posticus major, left complexus, and left sterno-cleido-mastoid. The opposite muscles contract when the face is turned to the left. In the formation of the walls of the Abdomen proper, bones and joints play but a small part. The lumbar vertebrae behind, the expanded wings of the iliac bones below, and the false ribs above, are the only bones to be considered. Three pairs of greatly expanded muscles— the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversales—lie at the sides and in front; and two pairs of muscles—the recti and pyramidales—are situated wholly in front. The in- ternal oblique and the transverse muscles are attached above to the ribs, behind to the lumbar spine, below to the iliac crest and to a strong band, Poupart’s ligament extending from the crest of the ilium to the pubic spine; the external oblique has similar connections above and below, but is not attached behind to the lumbar spine. The muscles all terminate in front in strong expanded tendons, forming the anterior abdominal aponeurosis, which blend together in the middle line anteriorly to form the band called linea alba, which stretches longitudinally from the xiplii-sternum to the pubic symphysis. These expanded tendons enclose the recti muscles, which pass from the pubic symphysis

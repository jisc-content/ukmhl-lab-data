Of the upper three sacral nerves the internal branches supply the multifidus spine muscle ; the external branches form loops with each other and supply the skin over the gluteus maximus. The Anterior Primary Divisions are not so uniform either in arrangement or distribution as are the posterior. branches, named communicating, muscular, and cuta- neous. By the Communicating branch each intercostal nerve is connected with an adjacent ganglion on the thoracic portion of the cord of the sympathetic system. By the Muscular or motor branches these nerves supply the intercostal muscles, the levatores costarum, and the triangulares sterni, whilst the lower intercostal nerves run forwards and downwards into the wall of the abdomen, and supply the oblique, the transverse, the recti, and Fig. 75.â€”Diagram of flic arrangement of a pair of Thoracic Spinal Nerves. SC, spinal cord ; AR, anterior nerve root; PR, pos- terior root, with its ganglion; PD, pos- terior primary division; AD, anterior primary division, or intercostal nerve ; SG, sympathetic ganglion, with the com- municating branches between it and the anterior division; M, muscles, with the motor branches entering them ; LC, lateral cutaneous, and AC, anterior cutaneous branches. They supply the front and sides of the axial part of the neck and trunk, and the extremities. The an- terior divisions of the twelve Dorsal or Thoracic nerves have the most simple arrangement. Each nerve, called from its position an Intercostal nerve, runs outwards, im- mediately below the lower border of a rib, and gives origin to three series of

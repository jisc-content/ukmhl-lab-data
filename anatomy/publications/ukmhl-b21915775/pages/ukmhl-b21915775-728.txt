They form between the two layers of the muscular coat an important plexus, named after its dis- coverer, Auerbach’s plexus, in which large stellate nerve- cells are intermingled with nerve fibres, and a similar nervous plexus is found in the muscular coat of the other divisions of the alimentary canal. It supplies and regu- lates the movements of the muscular coat. In the sub- mucous coat is found a nervous plexus, named Meissner’s plexus, after its discoverer, in the strands of which nerve- cells are collected into gangliform masses, and a similar plexus is found in the submucous coat of the other divisions of the alimentary canal. Auerbach’s plexus is connected with Meissner’s plexus by intercommunicating fibres ; and fibres pass from Meissner’s plexus to the mus- cularis mucosae, to the glandular layer of the mucous coat, and to the attached base of the villi. The LARGE INTESTINE, though not nearly so long as the small intestine, is of much greater diameter. It reaches from the end of the ileum to the orifice of the anus, and is divided into the coecum with the appendix vermi- formis, the colon, and the rectum; whilst the colon is sub- divided into the ascending colon, the hepatic flexure, the transverse colon, the splenic flexure, the descending colon, and the sigmoid flexure. The Coecum is the commencement of the large intestine, and lies below the ileum. It occupies the right iliac fossa, and is attached by areolar tissue to the fascia covering the iliacus muscle. Sometimes it is displaced from this position and hangs down into the true pelvis; more rarely it is elevated into the right lumbar region. It is the most

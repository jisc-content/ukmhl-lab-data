223 SPINAL COED. longitudinally in the grey matter which probably connect groups of nerve cells situated in different transverse planes. The nerve fibres in part at least divide and subdivide, and, as Gerlach has shown, form a narrow-meshed network of extremely minute fibres. The nerve cells are multipolar. Those of the anterior cornu are large, distinct, and stellate (fig. 68), and frequently form two well-defined groups, an antero-internal and an antero-external. The cells of the posterior cornu are, as a rule smaller, elongated, or spindle- shaped, but with stellate branched processes. They ,'are neither arranged in groups, nor so distinct as in the anterior horn, for the neuroglia is abundant, and forms at the tip of the posterior horn the substantia cinerea gelati- nosa of Rolando. Sometimes also isolated nerve cells may be seen m the white columns immediately outside the grey matter of this cornu. In the lateral horn, in the dorsal region of the cord, and in the corresponding structure in the cervical and lumbar enlargements are the stellate cells named intermedio-lateral group of nerve cells. In the lower dorsal region, from the origins of the 9th dorsal to the 3d lumbar nerve, are the cells forming Clarice's vesicular column or group of nerve cells. They are situated behind the plane of the central canal at the inner side of the base of the posterior cornu. Stilling has described a similar group in relation to the origins of the 2d and 3d sacral nerves, and another in relation to the origins of the 3d and 4th cervical nerves. The Columnar, external, white part of the cord consists of nerve fibres, with a supporting reticular framework of connective tissue and blood-vessels derived from the pia mater. But in addition a neuroglia is present, which con- sists partly of a delicate fibrillated material, and partly of

ANATOMY. 266 The Anterior Cerebral Vesicle gives origin through the Thala- mencephalon to the Optic Thalami, and through the Prosencephalon to the Corpora Striata and the convoluted Mantle of the Hemispheres, with their offshoots and subordinate parts. These constitute the Cerebrum proper, and the third and two lateral ventricles are the axial canal of the modified vesicle. Cerebrum. The Cerebrum or Great Brain lies above the plane of the tentorium, and forms much the largest division of the encephalon. It is ovoid in shape, and presents superiorly, anteriorly, and posteriorly a deep median longitudinal fissure, which divides it into two hemispheres (fig. 86). If the hemispheres be drawn asunder by opening out this longitudinal fissure, a broad white band, the corpus callosum, may be seen at the bottom of that fissure passing across the mesial plane from one hemisphere to the other. The outer surface of each hemisphere is convex, and adapted in shape to the concavity of the inner table of the cranial bones. Its inner surface, which forms one side of the longitudinal fissure, is flat and is separated from the opposite hemisphere by the falx cerebri. Its under surface, where it rests on the tentorium, is concave, and is separated by that membrane from the cerebellum and pons. The base of the brain presents either mesially, or immediately to the side of the mesial line, several objects. Winding round the outer side of each crus cerebri is a flat white band, the optic tract; these tracts converge in front, and join to form the optic commissure, from which the two optic nerves arise. The crura cerebri, optic tracts, and optic commissure enclose a lozenge-shaped region, the inter- peduncular space, which includes from behind forwardsâ€” a, the grey layer, pons Tarini, or locus perforates posticus: b, two white mammilla), the corpora albicanlia: c, a grey

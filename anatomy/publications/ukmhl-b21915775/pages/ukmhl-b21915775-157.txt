ENDOTHELIUM. 141 very abundant in the sub-epithelial tissue, where they form a layer parallel to the free surface of the membrane, from which short vessels pass vertically to open by minute orifices into the serous cavity. The serous membranes are attached by the sub-endothelial connective tissue to the organs which they invest. Each Serous Membrane consists of a portion which invests the viscus or organ, named the visceral layer, and a portion which lines the wall of the cavity in which the organ is situated, named the 'parietal layer. Between these two layers is the serous cavity, of only a capillary lumen, the boundary of which is formed by the smooth surface of both the parietal and the visceral layers. The serous membranes are as follows :â€”The two pleurae situated in the cavity of the chest, one investing each lung, and lining the interior of that part of the thoracic cavity in which the lung is situated; the pericardium, which invests the heart, and lines the bag in which the heart is contained; the peritoneum, which invests the abdominal viscera, and lines the abdominal cavity ; and the arachnoid membrane, which iuvests the brain and spinal cord, and is also regarded by some as lining the membranous dura mater, which encloses these important organs. The smooth free surfaces of the serous membranes are moistened by a limpid fluid, or serum, which facilitates their movement on each other, just as the free smooth surfaces of the synovial membranes are lubricated by the viscid synovia which they secrete. "7 The endothelium of the Serous Membranes consists of a layer of irregular squamous cells, the edges of which may be smooth or slightly serrated. The cells are closely adapted to each other by their edges, so as to form a continuous smooth layer, which forms the free surface of

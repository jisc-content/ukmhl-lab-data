ANATOMY". 122 clumps of protoplasm, without the presence of a nucleus, some modification of the doctrine, as regards the formation of the tissues from nucleated cells, seems to be necessary. For, although there can be no doubt that all the tissues are immediately derived from the ovum or fundamental cell, and that most of the tissues are derived directly from nucleated cells, yet there is reason to think that a differentia- tion of a cytode clump of protoplasm into tissue may take place, so that the direct formation of such tissue would be, not from a nucleated cell, but from the more simple cytode. Hence a more comprehensive generalisation, to which observers have gradually been led from the considera- tion of numerous facts, has now been arrived at,â€”that the tissues and organs of the body, whatever may be their form and composition, are formed of protoplasm, or produced by its differentiation; and that the protoplasm itself is derived by descent from the protoplasm substance of the primordial germ-cell. Some, indeed, have contended that protoplasm, cells, and their derivatives can arise by a process of pre- cipitation or aggregation of minute particles or molecules in an organic infusion, and that living matter may be thus spontaneously generated. But the evidence which has been advanced in support of this hypothesis is by no means satisfactory or conclusive, whilst the theory of the direct descent of protoplasm from pre-existing living protoplasm is supported by thousands of observations made by the most competent inquirers. Preliminary to the formation of the individual tissues and organs the segmentation cells of the fertilized ovum arrange themselves as the blastodermic membrane, which divides in the embryonic area into two layers, epiblast and hypoblast, forming the bilaminar blastoderm. Between these layers a third appears, the mesoblast, so that a trilaminar blastoderm is produced (fig. 11*). The mesoblast is derived either from

THE NOSE. 329 columnar, but not usually ciliated, though patches of ciliated epithelium cells are said to occur in man. Long, slender, and even branched processes proceed from the deeper end of each cell towards or even into the subepithelial connective tissue. The cells usually contain pigment granules. Be- tween the epithelium cells the characteristic olfactory cells of Schultze are situated. Each olfactory cell (fig. 96) consists of a globular or fusiform body, from which two long processes arise: one, the 'peripheral process, passes vertically between the ad- jacent columnar epithelium cells to the free surface of the mucous membrane: in am- phibia, reptiles, and birds it projects beyond the plane of the epithelium as a simple hair- like structure, or divided into several slender 11 olfactory hairs ; ” in fish and mammals, Fl6: 9G. • Section through the Ol- factory Mucous Membrane. e, epithelium cell; o, olfactory cell; c, its central vari- cose process; and p, its peripheral process. (After Schultze. man inclusive, it ends, without forming a hair-like prolongation, on the general plane of the mucous surface. The second or central process of the olfactory cell extends towards the sub-epithelial connective tissue : it is finer than the peripheral process, and has not uu- frequently a varicose appearance like a nerve fibre. In the intervals between the central processes of the olfactory cells and the cylindrical epithelium cells are small globular or elongated basal or replacement cells, which are probably an early stage of columnar epithelium. In the description of the development of the brain (p. 210), the origin of the Olfactory Bulb and Pedunclb from the hemisphere vesicle was referred to. In the adult

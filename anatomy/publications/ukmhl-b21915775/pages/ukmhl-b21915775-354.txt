338 ANATOMY. by recent observers. They, arise from the ciliary nerves, and enter the margin of the cornea in from twenty to forty fasciculi, which run from the circumference to the centre and to the anterior surface of the cornea, and give off numerous branches. Thin states that the nerves lie free in the lymph spaces and canals, and that between them and the flat cells lining the canals is the fluid-filled space in which the migrating corpuscles can wander. The nerve fibres soon lose their medullary sheath, and branch; adjacent branches then communicate, and form plexuses which possess nuclei at the points of intersection of the nerves. From these plexuses delicate branches again arise, some of which penetrate between the cells of the anterior epithelium, whilst others end in the proper tissue of the cornea. Kiihne stated that the terminal fibres ended in the cornea corpuscles, but this statement has not been confirmed. The Middle or Vascular Tunic. The Choroid coat forms the largest portion of the middle coat of the eyeball. It lies immediately internal to the sclerotic, and extends as far forward as the corpus ciliare, or annulus albidus, where it forms the ciliary processes ; it is pierced posteriorly by the optic nerve. It has a deep black colour, from the numerous pigment cells it contains, and is abundantly provided with blood-vessels and nerves. The most anterior layer of the choroid is the lamina vitrea. It lies next the pigmentary layer of the retina, and forms a translucent membrane, described by some as structureless, but by Kolliker as faintly fibrous, which is intimately connected with the stroma of the choroid. The stroma consists of a plexiform arrangement of bundles of connective tissue, with numerous, flattened, stellate, pigment cells, which give to the entire thickness of the choroid its black

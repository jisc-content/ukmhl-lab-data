783 KIDNEY. kiduey, that of the sheep, and of mammals generally, the lobules become fused together into a single organ. To obtain a knowledge of the structure of the gland, it will be necessary to make longitudinal sections through the organ from the convex border to the hilus. When this is done, the ureter will be seen to enter the kidney at the hilus, and to dilate into a wide pelvis, which divides, either directly or indirectly, into several short, truncated Fig. 219.â€”A longitudinal section through the kidney.

The substance of the kidney itself consists obviously of two parts, an ex- ternal highly vascular part forming the surface of the kiduey, and named the cortical portion; and an internal or central part, next the calices and pelvis, named the

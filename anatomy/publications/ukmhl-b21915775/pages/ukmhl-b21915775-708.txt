692 ANATOMY. folds or rugae, which have usually a longitudinal direction, but when distended the rugae are obliterated, and the surface of the mucous membrane is smooth. This mem- brane is usually said to be thicker at the pyloric end than in the fundus; but Brinton, who had opportunities of exa- mining the stomach of healthy young adults immediately after death, found the cardiac mucous membrane to be more than twice as thick as the pyloric : he ascribes the thinning of the cardiac mucous membrane to the effects of post-mortem digestion, owing to the gravitation of the gastric juice, in the recumbent position of the dead body, into the fundus of the stomach. If the free surface of the gastric mucous membrane be examined with a pocket lens it will be seen to be pitted with shallow depressions or alveoli, polygonal in form, and varying from x^-tli to -g^th inch in diameter. In the sides and bottom of each of these pits numerous rounded orifices may be seen, which are the mouths of the gastric secreting glands. If vertical sections be now made through the mucous membrane, these glands will be seen to be tubular in form. They are closely crowded together, and extend through the thickness of the mucosa; their deeper closed extremity being in relation to the submucous coat, whilst the open mouth of the gland is at the surface of the mucous membrane. In the human stomach the tubular glands are, for the most part, simple, almost straight cylinders, and possess an average length of -^g-th inch, and a breadth of about â€¢g-Yjjth inch. They are somewhat dilated at their orifices, and at their closed ends give rise to coecal pouches. The wall of the tubes consists of a condensation of the inter-

MUCOUS GLANDS OF MOUTH. 653 between and around the follicles of tympkoid tissue. Branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the de- scending palatine branches of Meckel’s ganglion, pass to the tonsil. MUCOUS AND SALIVARY GLANDS OF THE MOUTH. The ducts of numerous glands engaged in secreting mucus and saliva open on the free surface of the mucous mem- brane of the mouth. Their secretion not only keeps the mouth moist, and aids therefore in articulation, but by mingling with the food assists in mastication, deglutition, and the digestive process. Each gland is characterised by being divided into small lobules, and by possessing a duct or ducts, which branch off in an arborescent manner in the substance of the gland, and finally end in the minute lobules. They all belong to the Compound Racemose group of glands; other examples of which are found in the pan- creas, Brunner’s glands, the mammae, the lachrymal glands, Cowper’s and Bartholini’s glands. The Mucous glands of the mouth are situated be- neath its mucous lining in the following localities:—a, labial glands in the upper and lower lips, but absent at the augles of the mouth: b, buccal glands scattered on the inner surface of the cheek from the lips to the opening of the parotid duct: c, palatine glands on the oral sur- face of the hard palate, in the uvula, ou both surfaces of the soft palate and in the tonsils: d, molar glands, close to the last lower molar tooth on each side: e, lingual glands, extending backwards from the tip of the tongue along its margin, and also on the dorsum between the cir- cumvallate papillae and epiglottis.

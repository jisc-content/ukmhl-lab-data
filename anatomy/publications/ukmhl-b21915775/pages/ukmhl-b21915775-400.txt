The thickness of the cuticle varies in different localities from -i-tli to ^th inch; where the skiu is frequently exposed to pressure, as in the soles of the feet, the cuticle is the thickest and hardest; and the hands of those accustomed to manual labour have a hard and horny cuticle. The increase in thickness in these localities is for the purpose of protecting the highly sensi- tive cutis from injury. The outer surface of the cuticle in many parts of the body, especially the palm of the hand and the fingers, is marked by ridges and furrows; the ridges indicate the position and arrangement of the papillae of the cutis, whilst the furrows are due to the sinking of the cuticle into the spaces between the rows of papillae. The mouths of the sweat glands open on the surface of these ridges. The cuticle is divided into two strata. The superficial horny stratum consists of many layers of flat, polygonal horny scales like a tessellated epithelium ; the cells in these layers firmly adhere to each other by their surfaces, and in vertical sections this stratum presents a fibrous appearance; but the cells may be readily isolated by digestion in a caustic alkali. The deepest layer of the horny stratum, sometimes called stratum lucidum, consists of closely packed scales, and often has a bright appearance. The deeper or mucous stratum, or rete Malpighii, lies next the cutis, and closely follows the undulations of its papil- lary surface. The cells forming the layer next the cutis are short columns, those in the layers immediately succeed- ing are polyhedral and possess prickle-like processes pro- jecting from them ; hence the name, prickle cells, employed by Schultze. The prickles of adjacent cells do not apparently interlock, but are continuous with each other at

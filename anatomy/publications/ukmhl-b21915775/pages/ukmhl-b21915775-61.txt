APPENDICULAR SKELETON—LOWER LIMB. 45 nection between the axial skeleton and the shaft and foot, which form a free divergent Appendage. The Os Innominatum, or Haunch-bone, is a large irregu- lar plate-like bone, which forms the lateral and anterior boundary of the cavity of the pelvis. In early life it con- sists of three bones—ilium, ischium, and os pubis—which unite about the twenty-fifth year into a single bone. These bones converge, and join to form a deep fossa or cup, the acetabulum or cotyloid cavity, on the outer surface of the bone, which lodges the head of the thigh-bone at the hip- joint. One-fifth of this cup is formed by the os pubis, a little more than two-fifths by the ischium, and a little less by the ilium. At the bottom of the acetabulum is a depression, to the sides of which the inter-articular or round ligament of the hip-joint is attached. From the acetabulum the ilium extends upwards and backwards, the ischium downwards and backwards, the os pubis forwards and inwards. In front of the acetabulum is a large hole, the obturator or thyroid foramen, which is bounded by the ischium and os pubis; behind the acetabulum is the great sciatic notch which is bounded by the ischium and ilium. The Ilium (fig. 11) in man is a sinuous plate-like bone. In its most simple form, as in the kangaroo, it is a three- sided, prismatic, rod-like bone, one end of which enters into the formation of the acetabulum, whilst the other is free, and forms the iliac crest. In man, notwithstanding its expanded form, three surfaces may also be recognized, corresponding to the surfaces in the ilium of the kangaroo ; and, as in that animal, the lower end aids in forming the acetabulum, while the upper end forms the iliac crest, which, in man, in conformity with the general expansion of the bone, is elongated into the sinuous crista ilii.

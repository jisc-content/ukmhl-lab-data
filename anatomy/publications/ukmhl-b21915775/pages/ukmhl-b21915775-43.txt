27 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”HEAD. the forward projection of the glabella and supra-ciliary ridges is considerable; and in the well-known skull from the valley of the Neander it has reached a remarkable size. These ridges and the glabella mark the position of the air- sinuses in the frontal bone. The upper border of each orbit, which ends internally and externally in a process of bone called angular, forms the lower boundary of the fore- head, and has a notch or foramen for the supra-orbital nerve. The external angular process articulates with the malar, the internal with the nasal and superior maxilla. The cerebral surface of the bone is deeply concave, for the reception of the frontal lobes of the brain ; the concavity is deepened by the backward projection of the two thin orbital plates, the roofs of the orbits, which are separated from each other by the ethmoidal notch; at the margins of this notch are openings into the frontal air-sinuses, and here it articulates with the lachrymal and ethmoid. The Parietal bones, two in number (figs. 6 and 7), form the greater part of the side wall of the skull, and mount upwards to the vertex, where they unite to form the sagittal suture. Each bone is quadrilateral in form, and has about the centre of its outer surface an eminence, the centre of ossification of the bone, with which a hollow on the cerebral surface, lodging a convolution of the parietal lobe of the brain, corresponds. Below the eminence is the curved temporal ridge, usually double, and below the ridge the temporal surface of the bone. Three of its margins are strongly denticulated, for junction behind with the occipital, in front with the frontal, and mesially with the corresponding parietal; the fourth is scale-like, for union with the temporal, and forms the squamous suture; near the upper margin on the cerebral surface is a groove for

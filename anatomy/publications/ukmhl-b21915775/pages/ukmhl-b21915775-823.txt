They are lodged in the intervals between the septa testis, and Fig. 22C.—Transverse section through the Testicle and Epididymis of an infant.

Each lobe is composed of from two to four or six highly convoluted tubules; and as there are from 250 to 400 lobes in the testis, the num- ber of seminal tubules ranges probably from about 800 to 1000. The convoluted tubules in a lobe are connected together by delicate areolar tissue and capillary blood-

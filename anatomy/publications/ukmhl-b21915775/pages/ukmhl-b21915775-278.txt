ANATOMY. 262 inner border of a restiform body and with the obex. The two ligulae do not meet mesially, and the interval between them is filled up by the pia mater, which helps to form the roof, and is named tela choroidea inferior. Pro- jecting from this pia mater towards the ventricle are the vascular folds, the choroid plexuses of the 4th ventricle. The surface of the pia and of its choroid plexuses next the ventricle is lined by an epithelium, which, along with the ligulae and obex constitutes the dorsal wall of the cerebro- spinal tube, where it closes in the lower and_back part of the ventricle. The ventricle is lined by an epithelium continuous with that of the central canal of the medulla and cord. Secondary communications, however, arise between the ventricle and the sub-arachnoid space situated behind the tela choroidea inferior. The mesial opening or foramen of Magendie is immediately in front of the obex, and the two lateral openings or foramina of Key and Retzius are situated one near each side of the floor of the ventricle. The Middle Cebebeal Vesicle or Mesencephalon gives origin to the Corpora Quadrigemina and Crura Cerebri, whilst the Aqueduct of Sylvius is the axial canal of the modified vesicle. Crura Cerebri. The Crura Cerebri or Peduncles of the Cerebrum emerge from the upper surface of the pons, lie on the base of the brain, and diverging from each other as they ascend, pass, under cover of the optic tracts, into the hemispheres of the cerebrum. On the inner side of each crus is a groove through which the 3rd cranial nerve emerges, and on the outer side is the sulcus lateralis mcsenccpliali (Schwalbe),

ANATOMY. 198 of cell prevails, and the existence of a capsule of connective tissue around the individual cells can be recognised (fig. 67). The processes which arise from a multipolar nerve cell, as a rule, divide and subdivide as they pass away from the body of the cell, until at last they give rise to branches of extreme tenuity. These branching processes apparently consist exclusively of cell protoplasm, and have been called pro- toplasm processes. Gerlach has described the protoplasm processes of the multipolar nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord as forming, by their repeated branching, an excessively minute network, from which minute medullated nerve fibres arise; and F. Boll conceives that a similar arrangement occurs in the cells of the cerebellum. One, at least, of the processes of a multipolar nerve cell does not branch, but becomes directly continuous with the axial cylinder of a nerve fibre, and has been named the axial- cylincler process 68). This process was first recognised by Deiters in the cells of the spinal cord ; but Hadlich and Koschennikoff have since described the central process of the cells of the cerebellum as continuous with a medullated nerve fibre ; and the latter observer has pointed out, that from the base of a pyramidal nerve cell in a cerebral con- volution a process may be traced directly into a nerve fibre. Hence it would appear that the multipolar nerve cells may have two modes of union with nerve fibresâ€”one directly through the passage of the non-branched axial-cylinder process into a fibre, the other through the origin of fibres from the minute network in which the branched protoplasm processes terminate. The branched processes of adjacent nerve cells may also blend with each other, so as to form an anastomosing cell network, though these anastomoses are, in all probability, not so frequent as was at one time

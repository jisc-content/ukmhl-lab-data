87 MUSCLES OF MOUTH. which are inserted into them. The orbicularis oris is a sphincter muscle, the fibres of which lie both in the upper aud lower lips; by its contraction, aided slightly by the levator menti, the mouth is closed and the lips pressed against the teeth, as when a firm resolution is intended to be expressed. The Mouth is opened by the elevator muscles of the upper and the depressors of the lower lip; it is widened transversely by the zygomatic and risorius muscles, which pass to its corners, and which are brought into action in the acts of smiling and laughing. But the muscles of the lips also play an important part in connection with the reception of food into the mouth, and with the act of articulation (p. 646). The cavity of the Mouth forms the commencement of the alimentary canal, and is lined by a soft mucous membrane. In it the teeth and tongue are situated, and into it the secretion called saliva is poured. It opens behind into the pharynx. The side walls of the mouth are called the cheeks, and into the formation of each cheek a flattened quadrilateral muscle, the buccinator (fig. 20, a), enters. This muscle is attached above and below to the upper and lower jaw-bones, behind to the pterygo-maxillary ligament, to which the upper constrictor muscle (d) is also connected, so that the walls of the mouth and pharynx are continuous with each other, whilst in front the buccinator blends with the structures in the lips. It compresses the cheeks, and drives the air out of the cavity of the mouth as in playing a wind instrument; hence the name, “trumpeter’s muscle.” The aperture of communication between the mouth and pharynx is named the isthmus of the fauces. It is bounded below by the root of the tongue, on each side by the

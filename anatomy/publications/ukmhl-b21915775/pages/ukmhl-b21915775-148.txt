ANATOMY. 132 cavities should be termed Endothelium, whilst the cells covering the mucous surfaces should form the Epithelium properly so-called. The cells situated on the free surface of the skin, though usually termed the epidermis or cuticle, should also be referred to the epithelial structures. Speak- ing generally, one may say that by the term epithelium is meant the cells situated on free surfaces which are exposed either directly or indirectly to the air; whilst by the term Endothelium is meant the cells situated on free surfaces which are not exposed either directly or indirectly to the air. Epithelium. The free surfaces covered by an epithelium are the mucous membranes, and the skin. The Mucous Membranes secrete mucus, line internal passages and canals, and are continuous at certain orifices with the skin,—e.g., the mucous membrane of the Alimen- tary canal opens on the surface at the mouth and anus : the mucous membrane of the Respiratory passage opens on the surface at the nostrils, and is continuous in the pharynx witlvthe alimentary mucous membrane—it is also prolonged through the Eustachian tube into the tympanum, and is continuous through the nasal duct with the conjunctiva: the Geuito-Urinary mucous membrane opens on the sur- face at the orifices of the urethra and vagina. Mucous membranes also line the ducts of the various glands which open on the surface either of the skin or the several mucous canals. The epithelial cells are as a rule arranged in layers or strata, and the shape of the cells is not uniform in the different layers. The cells of the deeper strata are smaller, softer, and more recently formed than those of the super- ficial strata, and in the skin, in' the bladder, conjunctiva,

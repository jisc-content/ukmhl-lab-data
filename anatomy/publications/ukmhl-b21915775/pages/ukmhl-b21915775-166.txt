ANATOMY. 150 tissue from its elasticity, make’up the mass of the ligarnen- tum nuchee, the ligamenta sub-flava, and the yellow elastic coat of the arteries. They are also found mingled with the white fibres, in the fibrous membranes, the skin, the mucous and serous membranes, the areolar tissue, in tendons, and some ligaments. In the ligamenta sub-flava and nuchae the yellow fibres are arranged in bundles, the individual fibres of which are solid, comparatively broad, with a dis- tinct dark outline. They branch, and their branches readily break across, and the broken end then may curl upon itself. Their diameter is from y-g—tk to 7l-0]outh inch. In the middle coat of the arteries the elastic fibres form an anastomosing Fig. 42.— Fasciculus . of Fibres of Yellow network and in the inner coat a perforated Elastic Tissue from . , . iigameutumnuchas, elastic membrane. When mingled with the white fibres they are much finer, and sometimes do not exceed 25700^ inch diameter. They possess, however, a distinct and definite outline ; they branch and form a net- work and are often sinuous. Fibres possessing a ring-like, or spiral arrangement wind around the bundles of the white fibres and are usually described as elastic fibres, though some regard them as constrictions of a sheath investing each bundle of white fibres. The white fibres are composed of collagen, which yields gelatine on boiling ; the elastic fibres are composed of elastin. The white fibres swell up and become so transparent under the action of acetic acid as to be no longer recognisable. The yellow fibres, again, are not affected by that reagent. Quekett pointed out that the elastic fibres of the ligamentum nuclue of the giraffe were marked by transverse striae, and M. Watson has seen a

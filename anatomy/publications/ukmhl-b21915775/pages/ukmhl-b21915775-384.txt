ANATOMY. 368 The osseous vestibule communicates in the macerated bone with the tympanum, internal meatus, aqueductus vestibuli, cochlea, and semi- circular canals, but as the first three are occupied by membrane, the only communications left in the living head are with the semicircular canals and scala vestibuli of the cochlea. The membranous vestibule is formed of two small sac-like dilatations, the walls of which are directly continuous with each other, though the cavities are separated by an intermediate partition. The upper and posterior dilatation occupies the fovea hemi-elliptica, and is named utriculus ; it is larger than the lower and anterior, named sacculus, which lies in the fovea hemispherica. The sacculus is continuous with the ductus cochlearis of the membranous cochlea, and both sacculus and utriculus communicate by slender tubes with a short diverticulum lodged in the aqueductus vestibuli, to which the name of ductus vestibuli may be given (fig. 109). The membranous semicircular canals are about Jd the diameter of the osseous. Their walls are continuous with that of the utriculus, and they open by five orifices into it. Each has an ampulla within the ampulla of the osseous canal. The sacculus, utriculus, and membranous semicircular canals are attached by delicate ligamentous bands to the periosteal lining of the osseous vestibule and semicircular canals. The wall of the membranous vestibule and canals consists of a delicate fibrous membrane lined by a tessellated epithelium. The inner part of this membrane has a vitreous or hyalin lustre, and gives origin in the canals to short papillae which project into the lumen. The membranous vestibule and canals are distended with the fluid endolymph. The sacculus, utriculus, and ampullae are specially modified in connection with the peripheral termination of the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve. The membranous wall forms in each of these dilatations a projecting ridge, the macula,

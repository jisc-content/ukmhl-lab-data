INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 291 tinuous with the grey matter of the inferior temporo- sphenoidal convolution. The callosal convolution, according to Betz, at its commencement near the locus perforatus anticus, consists of little more than two layers, the 1st and 5th, the pyramidal cells of the 2d layer being few and small; but the fusiform cells of the 5th layer are large and lie vertically to the surface of the convolution. At the genu the 2d layer becomes thicker. At the middle of the convolution the 4th layer and the pyramidal cells of the 3d layer appear, but these cells are much smaller than in the other convolutions. The pyramidal and fusiform cells increase in size as they approach the splenium. The cortex of the gyrus hippocampi lias on the surface a layer of white matter, derived from the taenia tecta of the cingulum. Below this is a thin layer of neuroglia con- taining small, scattered corpuscles, the nuclear lamina. Below this lamina lies the stratum reticulare, in which the apices of the numerous pyramidal cells, which form the next layer, branch and again unite to form a delicate net- work. This layer of nerve cells is prolonged into the hippocampus major, in which it is rolled on itself in a con- voluted manner. The free surface (alveus) of the hippo- campus seen in the descending horn of the ventricle, consists of white matter, viz., the nerve fibres of the fimbria, or taenia hippocampi. But there is in addition a well-marked layer, prolonged also into the fascia dentata, which Meynert has termed the stratum of compressed nerve corpuscles. This layer, however, as was recognized by A. B. Stirling some years ago, resembles the “granules” of the rust- coloured layer of the cerebellum, and may more appro- priately be called the rust-coloured layer of the hippo-

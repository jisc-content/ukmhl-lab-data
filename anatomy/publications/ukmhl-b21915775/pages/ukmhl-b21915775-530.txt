ANATOMY. 514 with the veins in the parietooccipital region of the scalp by two small emissary veins, which pass through the parietal foramina; and each lateral sinus communicates with the veins at the back of the head through the emis- sary veins which pass through the mastoid and the posterior condyloid foramina. Nuhn has described emis- sary veins, continuous with the cavernous sinus, as passing through the foramen ovale in the sphenoid to become con- tinuous with the middle meningeal vein; Henle states that a similar vein goes through the foramen lacerum; and Rektorzik has recorded a similar vein descend- ing through the carotid canal in the petrous bone. The occipital sinus communicates with the posterior spinal plexuses of veins; the inferior cerebellar veins, or the petrosal sinuses, join the venous plexus surrounding the upper end of the spinal cord. The superior ophthalmic vein, by its communication, on the one hand with the cavernous sinus, and on the other with the veins of the face and forehead, connects the intra - cranial with the extra-cranial venous systems. Seseman maintains that, whilst the blood of the superior ophthalmic vein may flow into the cavernous sinus, yet that its chief outlet is into the facial vein. The middle meningeal veins arise in the dura mater, and leave the skull through the foramen spinosum to serve as rootlets for the internal maxillary vein. The Veins of the Spine are arranged in relation to both the spinal column and the spinal cord. The Veins of the Spinal Column ramify on the exterior of the vertebrae, in the substance of the vertebral bodies, and in the interior of the spinal canal. The extra-spinal or dorsal veins form a plexus on the back of the neural

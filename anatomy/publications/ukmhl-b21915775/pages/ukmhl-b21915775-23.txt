INTRODUCTION. 7 and generative functions. The Appendicular part forms the limbs, which do not contain organs essential to life. In man the limbs are called Upper and Lowerâ€”the former are instruments of prehension, the latter of support and progression. The subdivisions of the body are not homo- geneous in structure, but are built up of several systems of organs, each system being characterised not only by peculiarities in form, appearance, and structure, but by possessing special functions and uses. Thus the bones collectively form the Osseous system; the joints the Articulatory system ; the muscles, which move the bones at the joints, the Muscular system ; and these several systems collectively constitute the organs of Locomotion. The brain, spinal marrow, sympathetic ganglia, and nerves,[form the Nervous system, with which are intimately associated the organs of Sense ; the skin, with the hair and nails, the Tegumentary system; the heart, the blood-vessels, and lymph-vessels, the Vascular system; the lungs and wind- pipe, the Respiratory system; the alimentary canal, with the glands opening into it, the Digestive system; the kidneys, bladder, and urethra, the Urinary system ; the testicles, spermatic ducts, prostate and penis in the male, with the ovaries, uterus, vagina and clitoris in the female, the Generative or Reproductive system. These various systems are so arranged with reference to each other as to form that organic whole which we term the Human Body. The Organs of Locomotion will first attract our attention.

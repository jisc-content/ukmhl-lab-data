ANATOMY. 14 the lumbar vertebrae. In the 11th and 12th the transverse processes are stunted and non-articular, and present three tubercles, an external or costal, a superior or mammillary, and an inferior or accessory. The 12th has its lower articular processes vertical and convex forwards and out- wards, like those of a lumbar vertebra. The Lumbar Vertebrae in man are five in number, but amongst mammals they range from two in the platypus to eight in the hyrax or agouti. They are the lowest of the true vertebrae, and also the largest. The body is elongated transversely : the arch has short, deep laminae : the ring is triangular : the spine is massive, horizontal, hatchet-shaped : the transverse processes are long and pointed : the articular are strong and vertical, the superior pair concave, the inferior convex from side to side : the inferior notches, as in the dorsal vertebrae, are deeper than the superior. In the lumbar vertebrae an accessory process projects from the base of each transverse process, and a mammillary process from each superior articular process. In man these are small and rudimentary; but in some mammals, as the kangaroo, armadillo, and scaly ant-eater, the mammillary tubercles are large, and in the baboon, dog, cat, and beaver the accessory processes are well developed. The 5th lumbar vertebra has its body thicker in front than behind; its spine is less massive, its transverse processes are short and conical, and its lower articular processes are flattened. The Sacrum is composed of five originally separate vertebrae fused into a single bone. In the bandicoot it consists of a single vertebra, whilst it is formed of eight in the armadillo. The relative size and completeness of the sacrum are associated with the development of the haunch bones and of the lower limbs. In whales, where the pelvic

348 ANATOMY. the anterior surface of the retina, and lies next the vitreous body. Its anterior or hyaloid surface possesses a mosaic appearance, due to the presence of a layer of flat epithelial cells (Ewart). The 'pigmentary layer, or uvea (10), lies next the choroid, and consists of a mosaic of pentagonal and hexagonal cells usually containing pigment (fig. 45). These cells send delicate processes of contractile protoplasm between the rods of the bacillary layer. In the eyes of Albinos the cells contain no pigment, and in those animals that have the beautiful iridescent lustre, known as the tapetum hicidum, the pigment is also absent in the uvea, so that they are translucent. In ruminants and the horse the iridescence is due to the reflection of the light by the bundles of the connective tissue of the choroid, and in the dog and cat to polygonal cells which contain double refracting crystals (Schultze). The yellow spot exhibits some structural differences from the rest of the retina. It owes its colour to the presence of yellow pigment diffused between the elements of the retina. Except at its central depression, the fovea centralis, it is thicker than the surrounding parts of the retina; but it is much softer, a condition which is due to the almost complete absence of the layer of optic nerve fibres, and a diminution in the amount of the supporting connective tissue; the membrana limitans interna is, however, relatively stronger. In the fovea centralis itself the rods of the bacillary layer have entirely disappeared, and are replaced by cones, which are distinguished by their close arrangement, and the more slender form and increased length, especially of their outer segments.

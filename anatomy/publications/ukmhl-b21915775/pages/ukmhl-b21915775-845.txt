OVARY. 829 surface of the ovary by causing absorption of the surround- ing stroma. The surface of the ovary then gives way, tire wall of the follicle bursts, and the ovum and the liquid, with some of the cellular contents of the follicle, are dis- charged into the mouth of the Fallopian tube. The largest Graafian follicles can be readily seen with the naked eye, and measure from ^th to -^th inch in diameter, G'raafian follicles of middle size have an average diameter of about -gL-th inch, and contain a much smaller amount of follicular fluid. The smallest Graafian follicles are arranged in large numbers in the cortex immediately subjacent to the surface epithelium. They are about '^tli inch in diameter, contain no follicular fluid, and are lined by a single layer of the cells of the membrana granulosa, which are interposed between the ovum and the wall of the follicle. In rare cases two ova occur in a single follicle. These modifications in the size of the Graafian follicles are especially seen during the sexually active period of life. In children they are almost uniformly of small size, and number, in all probability, between 30,000 and 40,000 in each ovary. After puberty, from twelve to twenty or thirty, may be seen at one time expanding into follicles of the largest size, a change in condition which indicates that in them the ova are becoming mature. After an ovum is discharged, through rupture of the wall of the follicle, the chink on the surface of the ovary heals, and forms a scar, and the Graafian follicle becomes occupied by a yellowish mass, called a corpus hiteum. The corpus luteum is a lobulated body closely invested by the wall of the follicle, which possesses about its centre an irregularly elongated greyish band, which is softer than

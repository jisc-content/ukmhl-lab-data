446 ANATOMY. bracliialis anticus and supinator longus muscles, and to end at the outer side of the elbow j it is the artery of supply for the triceps. c. Inferior Profunda arises opposite the coraco-brachialis, and descends along with the ulnar nerve to the interval between the inner condyle of the humerus and the ole- cranon. d. Anastomotic arises from one to two inches above the elbow, and divides into two branches—the smaller branch descends on the brachialis anticus in front of the elbow; the larger pierces the internal inter-muscular septum, and reaches the interval between the inner condyle and the olecranon. e. Nutrient enters the nutrient canal in the shaft of the humerus to supply the medulla of the bone. The branches of the brachial artery may be arranged according to their distribution in four groups :— l,s£. To muscles alone : muscular branches. “2d. To muscles and region of elbow : superior profunda, inferior profunda, anastomotic arteries. 3d. To bone : nutrient artery. 4th. Terminal : radial and ulnar arteries. The Ulnae artery, the larger of the two terminal branches of the brachial extends down the ulnar side of the front of the fore arm to the wrist, where it crosses in front of the anterior annular ligament, and reaches the palm of the hand; it then curves outwards towards the thumb, and anastomoses with the superficial volar and radial index branches of the radial artery to form the superficial PALMAR arterial arch. In the fore arm the ulnar artery passes at first behind the pronator teres, flexor

ANATOMY. 246 roots of the 8th cranial nerve emerge, and this groove separates the olive from the restiform body. The Resti- form Body or yeduncidus cerebelli is the largest division of the medulla, and is formed in the lower part of the me- dulla by the funiculus cuneatus or postero-external column; by the direct cerebellar fibres of the lateral column of the cord, and by the funiculus Rolandi. The funiculus Rolandi is derived from the cervical part of the cord about the junction of the lateral and posterior columns, and behind the line of emergence of the roots of the accessory nerve. Internal to the restiform body and next the posterior median fissure is the Posterior Pyramid or fimicidus gracilis, continuous with the posterior median column of the corcl.^ Each posterior pyramid expands above into an eminence, the clava (fig. 83), then diverges from the postero-median fissure to blend with the corresponding restiform body. In addition to these longitudinal tracts the side of the medulla is traversed by transverse fibres, which spring from the restiform body and reach the anterior pyramid and mesial fissure. The lowest of these transverse fibres arch across the side of the olive find are called external arciform fibres; the highest cross immediately below the pons and form the ponticuhis. The Medulla Oblongata, like the spinal cord, consists both of grey and white matter. A central canal, continuous with that of the cord, lies in the medulla opposite the decussation of the pyramids, but above that spot it opens out posteriorly into the 4th ventricle. The surface of the medulla is not so exclusively formed of white matter as is the cord, for the grey matter becomes superficial on the floor of the 4th ventricle. As the spinal cord passes into the medulla oblongata a re-arrangement of the grey matter

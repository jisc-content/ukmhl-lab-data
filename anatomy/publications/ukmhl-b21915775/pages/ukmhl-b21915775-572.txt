ANATOMY. 556 above downwards and forwards, and as Lusclika has pointed out, is in front of and follows the curvature of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. Its inner and upper end, when the spleen is of average size, is about 1 inch from the spinal column, its outer and lower end reaches to about 11 inch from the tip of the eleventh rib. It varies much in size in different individuals, and at different times in the same person, but its average length is from 5 to 6 inches, and its breadth from 3 to 4 inches, whilst its weight varies from 5 to 7 ounces. The spleen is elongated in shape, and possesses two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The outer surface is smooth and convex, and in close contact with the concave under surface of the left half of the diaphragm; the movements of which muscle it follows during inspiration and expiration. The inner surface is concave, and in relation to the back of the stomach, to which it is attached by a fold of peritoneum, the gastro-splenic omentum. This surface is marked by several depressions through which the blood- vessels, lymphatics, and nerves enter the substance of the spleen ; these depressions collectively constitute the hilus. The left supra-renal capsule and kidney are in relation to a small partof this surface, situated behind the attachment of the gastro-splenic omentum. The anterior border often presents a notched or crenulated appearance. The posterior border is thicker and more rounded than the anterior. The upper and inner extremity is attached to the diaphragm by a fold of the peritoneum, named the suspensory or plvrtnico-splenic ligament. The lower and outer end, more pointed than the upper and inner end, is in relation to the splenic flexure of the colon and the phreuico-colic ligament.

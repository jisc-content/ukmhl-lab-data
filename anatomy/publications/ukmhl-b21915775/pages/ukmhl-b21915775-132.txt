116 ANATOMY. consist of protoplasm, and may be cited as furnishing excellent examples of its motive and contractile power. From the researches of Haeckel it would appear that pro- toplasm is capable of forming, without the super-addition of any other structure, independent organisms, which are at the lowest grade of organisation, and from their extreme simplicity are named by him Monera. To the group Monera be- long the genera Protamoeba and Pro- togenes. Haeckel has referred these simple organisms to a sub-kingdom FT^toL_manffforero‘od of P^otist.k, which he considers to plasm‘ lie on the confiues of both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. To a mass of protoplasm, whether it forms, as in one of these Pkotist/E, an independent organism, or is merely a portion of the sub- stance of the body of a higher organism, Haeckel has given the general name of a Cytode (fig. 25). So far back as 1861, Lionel Beale had described, under the name of germinal matter [Bioplasm), minute living particles of vegetable protoplasm, and in 1863 he demonstrated extremely miuute particles of living matter in the blood. Strieker had also called attention, in the bodies of the higher animals, to minute detached clumps of living proto- plasm. When a cytode is a naked clump of soft protoplasm, •without a trace of differentiation either on its surface or in it3 substance, as in the freely-moving Monera, it is a simple cytode; when the peripheral part of the cytode hardens, and differentiates into a more or less perfect envelope, as in the genera Protomonas and Protomyxa it is an encased cytode.

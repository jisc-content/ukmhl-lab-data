ANATOMY. 28 the lodgment of the superior longitudinal venous sinus. The anterior inferior angle articulates with the ali-sphenoid, and is marked by a groove for the middle meningeal artery ; the posterior inferior is grooved for the lateral venous sinus, and articulates with the mastoid of the temporal. The Temporal bones, two in number (figs. 6 and 7), are placed at the sides and base of the skull, and contain the organs of hearing. Each bone consists originally of four divisions—squamoso-zygomatic, tympanic, petromastoid, and styloid—which in course of time fuse together to form an irregular-shaped bone. The squamous part of the squamoso-zygomatic forms the thin plate on the side of the skull familiarly known as the “ temple,” and articulates with the parietal and ali-sphenoid. The zygoma extends horizontally forwards as a distinct arched process, and joins the malar or cheek-bone. At the root of the zygoma is a smooth fossa, called glenoid, whieh articulates with the condyle of the lower jaw. The tympanic portion forms in the foetus a ring, which expands subsequently into a curved plate that forms the auditory and vaginal processes which bound the external meatus, or passage into the tympanum or middle ear. The tympanic and squamoso-zygomatic parts of the bone fuse together; but a fissure, called Glaserian, situated behind the glenoid fossa, marks their original separation; in this fissure the slender process of the malleus (one of the tympanic ossicles) is lodged. The petro-mastoid or periotic part of the temporal contains the organ of hearing, and is complicated in its internal anatomy. It extends forwards and inwards along the floor of the skull, and forms on the exterior of the skull the large nipple-shaped mastoid process. This process is rough on its outer surface, for the attachment of muscles, grooved on

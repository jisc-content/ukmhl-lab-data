16 ANATOMY. in the tail, and in the long-tailed pangolin the number reaches forty-six. Not only is the tail itself rudimentary in man, but the vertebrae of which it is composed are small, and represent merely the bodies of the true vertebrae. As there are no arches, the ring is not formed, and the spinal canal does not extend, therefore, beyond the apex of the sacrum. The first coccygeal vertebra, in addition to a body, possesses two processes or cornua, which are jointed with two corresponding cornua from the last sacral vertebra. The Human Spine is more uniform in length in persons of the same race than might be supposed from the individual differences in stature, the variation in the height of the body in adults being due chiefly to differences in the length of the lower limbs. The average length of the spine is 28 inches; its widest part is at the base of the sacrum, from which it tapers down to the tip of the coccyx. It diminishes also in breadth from the base of the sacrum upwards to the region of the neck. Owing to the projec- tion of the spines behind and the transverse processes on each side, it presents an irregular outline on those aspects; but in front it is more uniformly rounded, owing to the convex form of the antero-lateral surfaces of the bodies of its respective vertebra. In its general contour two series of curves may be seen, an antero-posterior and a lateral. The antero-posterior is the more important. In the infant at the time of birth the sacro-coccygeal part of the spine is concave forwards, but the rest of the spine, except a slight forward concavity in the series of dorsal vertebra, is almost straight. When the infant begins to sit up in the arms of its nurse, a convexity forwards in the region of the neck appears, and subsequently, as the child learns to walk, a convexity forwards in the region of the loins. Hence in

ANATOMY. 364 The Malleus, or hammer, is the most external bone. In it may be recognised a head separated by a constricted neck from an elongated handle. Close to the junction of the neck and handle a long processus gracilis projects downwards and forwards to be inserted into the Glaserian fissure, and near the root of the long process a short process projects outwards. By its handle the malleus is intimately connected with the centre of the membrana tympani; by its head it articulates with the incus, whilst ligamentous fibres pass from it upwards, forwards, out- wards, and backwards to the tympanic walls. The Incus, or anvil-shaped bone, possesses a body and two processes ; on the anterior surface of the body is a saddle-shaped hollow into which the head of the malleus fits; the short process projects almost horizontally backwards, and is attached by a ligament to the posterior wall of the tympanum; the long process extends at first downwards and then inwards, to end in a rounded projection named os orbiculare, through which it articulates with the stapes. The Stapes, or stirrup-shaped bone, possesses a head and neck, a base and two crura ; the head articulates with the os orbiculare of the incus; from the constricted neck the two crura curve inwards to the base, which is attached to the fenestra ovalis. The joint between the malleus and incus is diarthrodial and saddle-shaped, and the articular surfaces are enclosed by a capsular ligament. The joint between the incus and stapes is also diarthrodial, and has a capsular ligament. Toynbee and Riidinger have described the base of the stapes and the margin of the fenestra ovalis as each invested by hyaline cartilage. Be- tween these plates plexiform elastic fibres extend, and the intervals between them are occupied by fluid; the joint seems, therefore, a modified amphiarthrosis.

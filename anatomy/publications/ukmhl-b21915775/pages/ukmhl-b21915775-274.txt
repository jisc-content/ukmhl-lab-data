The rust-coloured layer is distinguished by containing multitudes of so called “ granules,” the well-defined nucleus in which, as described by Strachan, is invested by a small quantity of branched protoplasm. These “granules” are, therefore, minute Fig. 82.—Vertical Section through a folium of the Cerebellum. 0, outer layer of grey matter in which are the corpuscles of Purkinje ; I, inner or rust-coloured layer; F, fibres of the white core ; V, V, vessels in the pia mater. A, a more highly magnified view of the “granules" of the rust-coloured layer to show the branched protoplasm stellate cells. A plexus of very delicate nerve fibres lies in this layer between the granules. The rust-coloured layer is at least twice as thick in that part of each cerebellar leaflet which lies next the surface, as opposite the bottom of a fissure between adjacent leaflets (fig. 82). The characteristic nerve cells of the cerebellum, named the corpuscles of Purlciuje, are situated in the grey cellular

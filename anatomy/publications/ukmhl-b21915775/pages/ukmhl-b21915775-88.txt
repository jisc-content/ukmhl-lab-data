72 ANATOMY. ouly; but if it passes over two or more joints, it acts on them in succession, beginning with the joint next the point of insertion. A given movement may be performed by the contraction of a single muscle, but as a rule two or more muscles are associated together, and they are not unfre- quently so arranged that one muscle initiates the move- ment, which is then kept up and completed by the rest. Muscles producing movement in ODe direction have opposed to them muscles which by their contraction effect the opposite movement; when both groups act simultaneously and with equal force, they antagonise each other, and no motion is produced ; when a muscle is paralysed or divided, its antagonistic muscle draws and permanently l’etains the part to its own side. The rapidity of action of a muscle is proportioned to the length of its fasciculi, its power of contraction to their number. Each muscle is invested by a sheath, the 'perimysium, formed of connective tissue. In the limbs and in the neck not only has each muscle a sheath, but a strong fibrous membrane envelopes the whole of the muscles, and assists materially in giving form and compactness to the region. This membrane is called generally a fascia or muscular aponeurosis, but special descriptive names are given to it in the different regions—e.g., cervical fascia, brachial aponeurosis, fascia lata or fascia of the thigh. In some localities muscles arise from the fascia, and in others they are inserted into it. The fascia is separated from the skin by a layer of subcutaneous fatty tissue, the superficial fascia, and in this layer muscles are in some localities developed. In the fat of the inner border of the palm of the hand a small muscle, the palmaris brevis, is found, which arising from the palmar fascia, is inserted into the

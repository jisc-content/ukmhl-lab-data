This coat is much thinner than the middle coat of a corresponding artery ; but in some veins, espe- cially those of middle size, it is thicker in proportion than in the largest sized veins. On the other hand, the veins of the pia mater, the venous sinuses in the dura mater, the veins of bones, of the retina, and the dilated veins of the corpora cavernosa, have no proper middle coat, and are without muscular fibres in their walls. In the smallest veins the venous rootlets, or venules, possess muscular fibres arranged transversely, but they are so scattered as not to form a continuous middle coat, and thus the venules present a marked contrast to the arterioles (fig. 142). Banvier indeed considers that no definite middle coat exists in any of the veins, and that they have only an inner and an outer coat, in the latter of which non- striped muscular fibres, varying in number and direction, may be present. The inner coat, or tunica intima, possesses a layer of endothelium next the lumen of the vein, the cells of which are polygonal scales, shorter and broader than those of an artery. Outside the endothelium is an extra-endothe- lial layer of connective tissue, and outside that again a network of elastic fibres, which does not possess the fenes- trated character. This coat is not so thick as in the corre- sponding arteries. In the pulmonary vein it is said to contain non-striped muscular fibres. The valves of the veins are continuous with the inner coat; they are covered by a layer of endothelium; the cells on the surface of the valve, situated next to the lumen of the vein, are, accord- ing to Banvier, elongated in a direction corresponding to the long axis of the vessel, whilst those on the opposite

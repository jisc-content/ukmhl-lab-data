164 ANATOMY. to the Haversian canals, irregular spaces, named Ilaversitn spices by Tomes and De Morgan, may also be seen in sections through the compact tissue : they are met with both in young and adult bones, and are regarded as produced by absorption of the bone in the localities where they occur. In thin sections through bone made trans- versely to the long axis of the Haversian canals, the dense tissue or matrix of the bone, which surrounds the canals, is seen to be arranged in concentric rings, as if it were built up of a series of lamellae one external to the other, and varying from two or three to half a dozen in number ; they are called the Haversian lamellae. Other lamellae lie in relation and parallel to the periosteal surface of the bone, and are called peripheral lamellae; others are in relation to the medullary canal and cancellated spaces, and may be named central lamellae: whilst others again are, as it were, intercalated between adjacent Haversian systems of lamellje, and are named intermediate or interstitial. Sharpey showed that a bone lamella, after the earthy matter has been dis- solved out by the action of 'an acid, was made up of mul- titudes of fine transparent fibres. De B. Birch states that the fibres in each lamella are in the same plane, and mostly parallel to each other. The peripheral and intermediate lamellae are perforated by stronger fibres, which pass through them either perpendicularly or obliquely, so as to bolt adjacent lamellae together. With a little care, these perforating fibres of Sharpey may be drawn out of the holes or sockets in which they are lodged. The perforating fibres are derived from the periosteum, and are formed both of white and elastic connective tissue. When thin sections through a macerated and dried bone are examined under the higher powers of the microscope,

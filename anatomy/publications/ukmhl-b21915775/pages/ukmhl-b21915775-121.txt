JOINTS AND MUSCLES—LOWER LIMB. 105 the tibia; and interposed between the tibia and femoral condyles are two menisci, the internal and external semilunar cartilages. The synovial membrane lines the investing ligament, covers the front of the femur for some distance above the.trochlea, and forms folds or pads within the joint itself, which in certain movements are interposed between the articular surfaces of the bones. The muscles which move the leg at the knee are inserted into the tibia and fibula. The flexors are the three hamstrings on the back of the thigh; they all arise from the ischial tuberosity, but the biceps in addition from the linea aspera, and are inserted—the biceps into the head of the fibula, the semi- tendinosus and semi-membranosus into the upper end of the tibia. The extensors form the fleshy mass on the front and outer side of the thigh; one muscle, the rectus, arises from the ilium—the others, the crureus, vastus interims and externus, from the shaft of the femur; they are all inserted by a powerful tendon into the anterior tuberosity of the tibia, and the patella is a sesamoid bone, developed in this tendon (fig. 18). The knee can be bent so that the calf can touch the back of the thigh, and in this position the patella is drawn down in front of the joint, as in kneeling. The articular surface of the patella is divided into seven areas or facets—an internal perpendicular and three pairs of transverse facets (Goodsir). In acute flexion of the knee the internal perpendicular is in contact with a crescentic or patellar facet on the internal condyle of the femur ; in passing from the bent to the extended position of the joint, the transverse facets come successively into contact with the trochlear surface of the femur, until, when the leg is fully extended on the thigh, the whole of the patella is raised above the trochlea, except the lowest

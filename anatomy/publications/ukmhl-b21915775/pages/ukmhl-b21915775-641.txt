625 THE PLEURA. or the effusion of fluid into the cavity, in the course of inflammation of the pleura; either of these causes would push the lung backwards towards the spine, and occasion a great interval between the pulmonic and parietal parts of the pleura. But even in the healthy chest a modification in the relations of the pulmonic to the parietal pleura takes place in some localities. For as, during expiration, the lung does not pass either so far forwards or downwards, as during inspiration, the lung leaves the parietal pleura along its line of reflection from the ribs to the diaphragm, and from the sternum to the side of the pericardium, so that at the end of an expiration the smooth surface of the diaphragmatic and the mediastinal pleura is in apposi- tion along these lines with the smooth surface of the costal pleura. The pleura is supplied with blood by the intercostal, internal mammary, and bronchial arteries, which ramify in the sub-endothelial layer of connective tissue. Lymphatic vessels form fine networks in the same layer, and commu- nicate through microscopic stomata with the pleural cavity. Nerves pass to the pleura both from the phrenic nerve and from the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic cord. It is not uncommon to find along the line of reflection of the pleura from the ribs to the diaphragm, and from the diaphragm to the side of the pericardium, folds of the pleural membrane containing lobules of fat; and on the costal wall of the chest large lobules of fat are often developed beneath the parietal pleura. These folds have been called pleural villi, and they resemble the appendices epiploicm, to be afterwards described, in the abdominal cavity.

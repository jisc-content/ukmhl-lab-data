397 THE HEART. is reflected as a covering upon those great vessels, and is continued from them over the exterior of the heart itself, so as to give it a covering, possessing a smooth, free, I glistening serous surface, which is called the visceral layer of the pericardium, or the epicardium. The serous lining does not form a separate covering for the aorta and the pulmonary arterial trunk, but encloses them in a common sheath; each of the great veins has its own investment, though the covering given to the inferior cava is very short, as that vein opens into the right auricle immediately on piercing the fibrous membrane of the pericardium. A fold of the pericardium, named by Marshall the vestigial fold, is situated between the left pulmonary artery and immediately subjacent pulmonary vein. This fold marks the position of a vessel present in the embryo heart, and known as the left superior vena cava, or duct of Cuvier. The free surface of the epicardium glides upon the serous lining of the bag during the move- ments of the heart, and the two surfaces are lubricated by a little serous fluid; which under certain pathological conditions may increase in quantity, and produce dropsy of the pericardium. THE HEART. The Heart is a hollow muscle enclosed in the peri- cardium, and lying in the thoracic cavity in the middle division of the mediastinal space between the two pleural membranes. It is the great motor organ for the circula- tion of the blood, and, though varying in its dimensions with the amount of blood that it contains, may be said to be of much the same size as the fist of the individual.

566 ANATOMY. Tlie lobules are arranged as if grouped around an axia spirally twisted stem, in which the vascular trunks of the gland are situated. By some observers the stem is believed to be hollowed out into a central canal. The lobules are still further subdivided into numerous thymus follicles. Each thymus follicle is formed of lymphoid tissue corresponding in structure to the lymph follicles already described (p. 547). The thymus follicles may either be separated fromâ€˜each other by distinct capsules; or the infiltration of lymph corpuscles into the meshes of the connective tissue may be so great that adjacent follicles appear to have run together. Bodies presenting a concentric appearance, the concentric corpuscles of Hassall, also occur, and, in the later stages of growth, cells con taining oil drops, which mark the commencing fatty degeneration of the gland, are also present. The lobules of the thymus frequently contain a space in the centre, which some observers regard as normally present, though others consider it to be produced artificially by the break- ing down of the lymphoid tissue of the centre of the lobule. The thymus gland receives its supply of blood from the thymic branches of the internal mammary, and from the superior and infei-ior thyroid arteries. They pass to the stem of each lobe, and send off lateral branches to the lobules, which end in a capillary network within the thymus follicles. The veins which arise from the capil- laries, pass out of the lobes to end in the internal mammary and innominate veins. Lymphatics are situated in the connective tissue between the lobules and follicles, but their relation to the lymphoid

STOMACH. 693 glandular couuective tissue, which forms a membrana propria; flat stellate cells are said to occur in it. Foi about the upper fourth or fifth of their length the tubes are lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium, con- tinuous with the columnar epithelium covering the fiee surface of the gastric mucous membrane. In these columnar cells the nucleus is situated close to the attached end of the cell. In the rest of the gland- tube Brinton found two kinds of cells. The one consisted of the so-called peptic cells, about TiiVgth inch in diameter, and of an ovoid or somewhat polygonal form, which lay next to the wall of the gland. The other kind, somewhat cubical in form, lined the very narrow central canal of the gland, and formed an axial ^ kiddie layer, which was continuous above columnar^pTeiiumTT'axiai with the columnar epithelium lin- MorV h&hfy maimed viewsâ„¢' lDg tiI6 upper end. of tlie tube. given. From Brinton. Brinton stated that this dimor- phous structure of the gastric glands exists throughout the vertebrata. It is in the dog and cat, however, that the structure of the gastric mucous membrane has especially been studied, and two kinds of glands have been described. The one, situated especially in the region of the pylorus, consists for the most part of simple tubes, which may however

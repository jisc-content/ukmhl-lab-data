Between the urachal and hypo- gastric folds is a dimple-like fossa: between the hypo- gastric and epigastric folds is a similar depression. Im- mediately external to the epigastric fold is a depression corresponding to the internal or deep abdominal ring—the entrance to the inguinal canaL Immediately below the inner end of Poupart’s ligament, another depression may sometimes be seen, which marks the crural ring, or entrance into the crural canal. The inguinal and crural fossae are of great surgical interest in relation to the seats of inguinal and femoral herniae. In the posterior abdominal wall, immediately to the left of the junction of the duodeuum and jejunum, and on a level with the left side of the 2nd lumbar vertebra, a pocket- like involution of the peritoneum, about the size of a wal- nut, is sometimes seen. The entrance to this pocket is marked by a crescentic fold of the peritoneum continuous with the meso-colic fold. Coils of the small intestine have been known to become incarcerated in this pocket, a con- dition which has been named retro-peritoneal hernia, though the name intra-peritoneal, as suggested by J. Chiene, would be more appropriate. A pocket-like invo- lution of the peritoneum sometimes exists behind and below the ccecum; and another in the peritoueal fold at the junction of the sigmoid flexure of the colon with the rectum, both of which may become the scats of an intra- peritoneal hernia. Special names are applied to the folds or duplicatures of the peritoneum, which pass from the wall of the abdomen

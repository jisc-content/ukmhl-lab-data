ANATOMY. 144 Comnective Tissue. By tlie term Connective Tissue is meant a group of tissues wliicli, though the members of the group differ from each other, both in naked eye and microscopic characters, yet agree in the property of binding or connect- ing other tissues or parts of the body, and in serving as a supporting framework for more delicate tissues. This group of tissues is the most extensively diffused of all the textures, for there is no organ in the body which does not contain one or other of its forms. The following varieties, based on modifications iu their appearance and structure, may be recognized. a. Neuroglia. This name, which means nerve glue, has been applied by Virchow to the delicate tissue in the central organs of the nervous system, and in the retina, which supports the nerve cells, nerve fibres, and blood-ves sels of those parts. It is homogeneous, or finely granular, or contains a network of fine fibrils, and in it elliptical or ovoid nuclei, or stellate flattened corpuscles are situated. A form of tumour, named Glioma, is sometimes produced by the excessive growth in the brain or retina of the neuroglia. b. Retiform connective tissue constitutes the stroma or supporting framework of the lymphatic glands. It is also found in the solitary and Peyer’s glands of the alimentary Fig. 35.—Section of the White Matter of the Cerebrum. The nuclei of the neuroglia, nerve fibres, and capillary blood-vessels are represented.

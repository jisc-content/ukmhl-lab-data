468 ANATOMY. inwards under cover of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw as far as the spheno-maxillary fossa, where it divides into six terminal branches. In this course it lies at first below the external pterygoid muscle, and between the jaw and the internal lateral ligament; then it crosses over the external pterygoid, between that muscle and the coronoid insertion of the temporal, though it not unfrequently pierces the external pterygoid, or even goes behind it; and lastly it dips between the two heads of the external ptery- goid, and enters the spheno-maxillary fossa. Its branches are numerous, and are usually arranged in three sets. ' The first set of branches arise between the jaw and the internal lateral ligament, and in their course enter fora- mina or fissures iu the bones of the head. They are as follows :—tympanic branch passes through the Glaserian fissure to supply the mucous membrane of the tympanum : middle meningeal branch ascends under cover of the external pterygoid muscle to the foramen spinosum in the ali-sphenoid, and ramifies extensively in the dura mater to supply it and the inner table of the cranial bones; it gives off a small meningeal branch, which enters the skull through the foramen ovale : inferior dental branch, which accompanies the inferior dental nerve along the dental canal in the lower jaw, and supplies the teeth; when opposite the mental foramen it gives a mental branch to the struc- tures of the chin. The second set of branches arise from the internal maxillary as it lies in contact with the external pterygoid, and are distributed to muscles. They are as follows:— masseteric branch to the masseter: pterygoid branches to the two pterygoid muscles: buccal branch to the bucci-

328 ANATOMY. longation of the integument, studded with numerous short hairs or vibrissas which possess large sebaceous glands. Each nasal chamber is lined by a mucous membrane called the 'pituitary or Schneiderian membrane, which is pro- longed into the meatuses and the air sinuses opening into them; posteriorly it is continuous with the mucous lining of the pharynx, and anteriorly it blends with the cutaneous lining of the vestibule. The pituitary membrane is thick and soft, and diminishes the size of the meatuses and the openings of the air sinuses as seen in the skeleton. The mucous membrane is divided into a respiratory and an olfactory region. The respiratory region corresponds to the door of the nose, to the inferior turbinated bone, and to the lower third of the nasal septum. It is covered by a ciliated columnar epithelium, and contains numerous racemose glands for the secretion of mucus or pitnita. It is also vascular, and the veins which ramify in it have a plexiform arrangement. The mucous lining of the air sinuses is also ciliated, but almost devoid of glands, except in the antrum, in which region the glands sometimes dilate into cystic tumours. The olfactory region is the seat of distribution of the olfactory nerve and of its peripheral end-organs. It corre- sponds to the roof of the nose, to the superior and middle turbinals, and the upper |ds of the septum. The mucous membrane is thick, soft, easily destroyed, of a yellowish- brown colour, and blended with the periosteum. When vertical sections through this membrane are examined microscopically, the tubular glands discovered by Bowman may be seen in its vascular connective tissue layer. These glands contain roundish secreting cells, with yellowish- brown pigment-stained contents. The epithelium is

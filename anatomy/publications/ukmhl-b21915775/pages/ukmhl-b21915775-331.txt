ENCEPHALIC NEIiYES. 315 meningeal. It also receives the small petrosal nerve, through which it obtains roots from the knee-shaped bend of the portio dura and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. It supplies the tensor tympani and tensor palati muscles, and sends a twig to the chorda tympani. The branches of the three divisions of the 5th cranial nerve, which pass to the skin of the temple, forehead, and face, freely communicate with the branches of the portio dura, which supply the muscles situated in those regions. The Glosso-pliaryngeal or uppermost division of the 8th nerve springs out of the side of the medulla between the olivary and restiform bodies; its roots arise from a grey nucleus in the floor of the 4th ventricle (fig. 80) in common with one root of the vagus. It leaves the skull through the jugular foramen, and possesses two small ganglia, the jugular and petrous. It then runs across the side of the neck, in relation to the stylo-pharyngeus, and gives off carotid branches along the internal carotid artery : pharyn- geal branches to the mucous membrane of the pharynx : muscular branches to the stylo-pharyngeus and perhaps the middle constrictor: tonsilitic branches to the tonsil and soft palate: glossal branches to the base of the tongue and the circumvallate papillae, which branches are unquestion- ably nerves of the special sense of taste. Through the petrous ganglion the nerve communicates with the vagus and sympathetic. , The petrous ganglion gives off the tympanic branch or nerve of Jacobson, which enters the tympanic cavity, and forms a plexus on the promontory: it supplies the mucous membrane of the tympanum and Eustachian tube, and gives off three communicating branchesâ€”one to the carotid plexus of the sympathetic: a second to the great petrosal, and through it to the knee-

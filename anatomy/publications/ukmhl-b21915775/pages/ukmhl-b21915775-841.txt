The essential organs of reproduction in the female are two genital glands, thedOvaries, in which are found the Ova, or Germ-cells. In close relation to the ovaries are the Fallopian tubes, the Uterus, and Vagina, along which the ova are conveyed. Should an ovum become impreg- nated, it remains lodged in the uterus until the develop- ment of the embryo is completed. When the child is ready for birth, it is expelled from the uterus along the vagina. The Fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina constitute the genital tubes and passages. The Fallopian tubes are the excretory ducts of the ovaries, but are hot anatomically continuous with them. Certain accessory organs, named the Par-ovaria, the Clitoris, the Hymphse, the Vestibular Bulb, and the Mammse, are also present.

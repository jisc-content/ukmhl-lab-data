191 NERVOUS TISSUE. homogeneous, nucleated membrane. It is believed to be absent from the nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, as well as at the peripheral terminations of many nerves. The medullary sheath is a fatty and albuminous sub- /> stance (myelin), which re- gk fracts the light strongly.

By gentle pressure it can be squeezed out of the broken end of a fibre and it leaves behind a fr^ewbrlTof a strongly refracting corneous material, in the meshes of which, the myelin was | contained (Kiihne and Ewald). Ranvier has described the medullary sheath as, divided into segments from breaks in its continuity, occurring at intervals in the fibre. These breaks have been called the nodes, or constrictions of Ranvier. The axial cylinder is, however, prolonged across the node from one segment to the other, and at the node an annular fold of the primitive membrane is in contact with the axial cylinder. Lantermann has recently described fine indentations passing obliquely across the medullary sheath in the intervals between the constrictions of Ranvier. The axial cylinder is a pale, grey, cylindriform band, usually about one-third or one-fourtli the diameter of the fibre, which possesses more tenacity than the medullary

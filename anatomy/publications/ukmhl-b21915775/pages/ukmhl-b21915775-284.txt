ANATOMY. 268 fissure; it separates tlie frontal from the parietal lobe. The parieto-occipital fissure, is about two inches from the hinder end of the hemisphere; it commences at the longitudinal fissure, passes vertically down the inner surface of the hemisphere, and also transversely outwards for a short distance on its outer surface ; it separates the parietal from the occipital lobe. = The Older Surface of the Hemisphere, The Temporo-Sphenoidal Lobe (figs. 85, 87) presents from above downwards three parallel convolutions, the superior, middle, and inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolu- tions. They all blend in front at the tip of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe. Behind, the superior convolution joins the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe, and the middle and inferior join the lowest convolution of the occipital lobe. The fissure which separates the superior from the middle convolution is called the parallel fissure. The Occipital Lobe forms the hinder end of the cerebrum, Pig. 85.

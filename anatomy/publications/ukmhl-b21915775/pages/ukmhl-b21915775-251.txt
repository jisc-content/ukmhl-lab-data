SPINAL NERVES. 235 from the 2d and 3d cervical, to the skin of the front of the side of the neck ; the supra-clavicular nerves, from the 3d and 4th cervical, to the skin of the lower part of the side of the neck, and upper part of the chest. The Brachial Plexus is formed of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical nerves and of the larger portion of the 1st dorsal nerve (fig. 76), which pass outwards between the anterior and middle scaleni. It is of large size, and is principally for the supply of the upper limb. It presents variations in arrangement. Sometimes the 5th and 6th nerves join to form a large nerve, which is then joined by the 7th, to form the upper cord of the plexus. The 8th cervical and the 1st dorsal then join, to form the lower cord of the plexus. The cords then pass behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle into the axilla, where jthey become modified in arrangement. Trom each a large branch arises, and these two branches then join to form a third cord. The three cords have special relations to the axillary artery; the one which lies to its outer side is named the outer cord; that to the inner, the inner cord; that behind, the posterior cord. At other times the upper cord is formed by the 5th and 6 th and a branch of the 7th ; the lower cord by the 8th cervical and 1st dorsal; and the posterior cord by a branch of the 7th nerve and by branches from the upper and lower cords. These nerves and the cords formed by them give origin to communicating, muscular, cutaneous,,and mixed branches. Communicating branches join the middle and inferior cervical and 1st thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic system. Muscular branches supply the scaleni, longus colli, rhomboid from the 5th, and subclavius from the 5th and 6th; a supra- scapular branch from the 5th and 6th to the supra- and

THE BRAINâ€”CEREBELLUM. 261 angles are where the restiform bodies branch off to the cerebellum. The floor is divided into two lateral halves by a longitudinal mesial fissure, continuous at the calamus with the central canal of the medulla and cord. The floor consists of the grey matter of the medulla and pons, which is continuous with the grey matter of the cord and gives origin to the roots of the cranial nerves from the 5th to the 9th inclusive. The bluish black spot, named locus cceruleus, is in the floor close to the entrance to the aqueduct of Sylvius. Its nerve cells, charged with dark pigment, give origin to the sensory root of the 5th, and perhaps to the posterior root of the 4th cranial nerve. On each side of the mesial fissure is the longitudinal elevation, the fasciculus teres. White lines, the striae acusticee, or roots of the auditory nerve, pass from the mesial, fissure across the floor to reach the surface of the restiform body. The roof of this ventricle is formed anteriorly of the valve of Vieussens or anterior medullary velum, which stretches between the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum and reaches the corpora quadrigemina. This velum consists partly of a layer of white matter which is continuous with the white or medullary matter of the vermiform process, and partly of four to five transversely arranged shallow lamellae of grey matter, projecting into the velum in a tongue like process, lingida, and continuous behind with the anterior end of the superior vermiform process. Behind the anterior velum is the nodule or anterior end of the inferior vermiform process, with the white medullary core in which the posterior medullary velum is continuous. Behind the nodule and forming the thinnest and most posterior part of the roof is a pair of thin bands of white matter, the ligulx, each of which is continuous with the

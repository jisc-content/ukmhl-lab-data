INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 293 The grey matter is apparently distinct from the outer nucleus of the thalamus, and contains numerous stellate pigmented nerve cells. The Corpus Subthalamicum (Schwalbe) consists of a grey mass situated under the optic thalamus and containing stellate nerve cells. It is separated from the thalamus by a layer of white matter, the zona incerta (Forel), which is continuous with the tegmentum. c, The central grey matter of the cerebrum is in series with the central grey layer surrounding the aqueduct of Sylvius. It is situated at the sides and floor of the 3d ventricle. It forms the middle or soft commissure of that ventricle, and the grey surface of the inner wall of the optic thalamus, which is continuous with the inner nucleus. The grey masses situated at the base of the brain between and in front of the crura cerebri, viz., the pons Tarini, tuber cinereum, lamina cinerea, infundibulum, and the grey matter of the pituitary body, belong- to the central grey matter and contain nerve cells. Each corpus albicans con- tains in its interior grey matter with nerve cells. By some anatomists the grey matter of the pineal body is referred to the same category, but Arnold has pointed out that it is separated by its peduncle from the soft commissure ; and Meynert is disposed to regard it as a ganglion of origin of the tegmentum. Both the pituitary and pineal bodies contain other structures besides the nervous matter (pp. 573, 574). The White Matter of the cerebrum consists of tracts or fasciculi of nerve fibres, which connectâ€”a, the cerebrum with the lower divisions of the encephalon, peduncular fibres; b, the two hemispheres together, commissural fibres; c, different structures in the same hemisphere, association

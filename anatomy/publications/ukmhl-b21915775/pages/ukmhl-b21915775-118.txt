ANATOMY. 102 in the stooping position of the body; but too great move- ment backward of the apex is checked by the sacro-sciatic ligaments. As the weight of the trunk, or of what may be carried in the arms or on the back, is transmitted through the haunch-bones to the lower limbs, the sacro-iliac liga- ments require to be of great strength, because the sacrum, as well as the entire trunk, is suspended by them on the two innominate bones. The Hip Joint is a ball-and-socket joint; the ball is the head of the femur, and the socket the cup-shaped aceta- bulum in the haunch bone, the depth of the cup being increased by the cotyloid and transverse ligaments attached around the brim. A large capsidar ligament encloses the articular surfaces. This ligament consists of circular and longitudinal fibres; the longitudinal fibres form the ilio-femoral or Y-shaped hand, passing from the anterior inferior iliac spine to the anterior inter-trochanteric line; the ilio-trochanteric hand from the dorsum acetabuli to the root of the great trochanter; the puho-femoral hand from the pectineal eminence to the front of the small trochanter ; the iscliio-capsular or ischio-femoral from the ischium below the acetabulum to end either in the capsular ligament or in the digital fossa. The capsular ligament is firmly attached to the anterior inter-trochanteric line, but only feebly to the back of the neck of the femur. Within the capsule is the ligamentum teres attached to the head of the thigh bone and to the sides of the cotyloid notch. The capsular ligament is lined by a synovial membrane, which invests the neck of the femur and the ligamentum teres. The hip joint has free mobility, and much more stability than the shoulder, owing to the acetabulum being deeper than the glenoid fossa, and the greater strength of its capsular

253 THE BRAINâ€”PONS. raphe is formed; these commissural fibres may be re- garded as a system of arciform fibres similar to those of the medulla oblongata. The longitudinal fibres of the pons pass vertically upwards from the medulla oblongata. They consist in large part of the anterior pyramids, which break up into bundles situated between the bundles of deep transverse fibres and then leave the pons as the peduncular fibres of the crusta of the crura cerebri. But deeper in the pons than its pyramidal fibres are other longi- tudinal fibres which ascend through its substance. On the floor of the 4th ventricle are the fasciculi teretes continuous with the same structures in the medulla oblongata (p. 251, fig. 83). To the side of and deeper than each fasciculus teres is the tract named the lemniscus or olivary fillet. It is continuous below with the formatio reticularis of the medulla, the basis bundle of the anterior column and perhaps the mixed zone of the lateral column. It ascends to the side of the 4th ventricle between the superior and middle peduncles of the cerebellum and passes into the posterior part of the outer side of the corpora quadrigemina. The pons also contains in its substance a formatio reticularis; and the roots of the 5th, 6th and 7th cranial nerves emerge from it. The grey matter of the pons is scattered irregularly through its substance, and appears on its posterior surface, but not on the anterior surface. It forms small collections of multipolar nerve cells, nuclei pontis, situated in the intervals between the transverse and longitudinal bundles of fibres. Deeper than the deep transverse fibres is the collection of nerve cells named superior olive ; and in the upper part of the floor of the 4th ventricle are the cells of the locus cceruleus.

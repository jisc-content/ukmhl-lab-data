781 KIDNEY. kidney is a little higher than the right. The hilus of the kidney is opposite the 1st lumbar vertebra. The kidneys lie behind the peritoneum, and are surrounded by a mass of fat and loose areolar tissue. Each kidney is about 4 inches long, 2 to 3 inches wide, and from 1 to 1J inch in thickness. The average weight is between 4 and 5 oz. The shape of the kidney is characteristic. It possesses two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The anterior stirface is convex, and looks forwards and out- wards ; on the right side it is in relation to the duodenum and ascending colon, on the left side to the descending colon. The posterior surface is flattened, and rests on the crus of the diaphragm, and on the fascia covering the quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles : on a plane still more posterior to the upper part of this surface, are portions of the 11th and 12th ribs. The outer border is convex, and directed towards the postero-lateral wall of the abdomen. The inner border is concave, and directed for- wards towards the spine: the deep fissure in this border is called the hilus, and allows of the passage of the vessels, nerves, and ureter into or out of the kidney. The upper extremity is thicker and more rounded than the lower, and has the supra-renal capsule in relation with it. The upper end of the right kidney, and the immediately adjacent part of the anterior surface, are in relation to the liver; the corresponding parts of the left kidney are in relation to the spleen. The lower extremity is smaller and thinner than the upper, and does not reach so low as the level of the crest of the ileum. In rare cases one kidney has been known to be con-

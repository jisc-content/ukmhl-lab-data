ANATOMY, 202 In certain of the mucous membranes delicate nerves have been traced into the layer of epithelium, situated on the free surface of the membrane. Petermoller described nerve fibres, continuous with the nerves of the cornea, passing into the layer of conjunctival epithelium on the front of the cornea. Klein recognised an iutra-epithelial nervous net- work in the same locality. Chrschtschonovitsch traced non-medullated nerve fibres proceeding from a subepithelial network into the deeper epithelial layers of the vaginal mucous membrane, and similar nerve fibres have been seen by Elin to end in the epithelial investment of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Connected with the sensory nerves in some localities are the remarkable bodies named the Corpuscles of Pacini, or Bodies of Vater, which were the first terminal organs dis- covered in connection with the peripheral distribution of the nerves. These corpuscles are attached to the cutaneous nerves of the fingers, toes, palm, and sole, to the nerves of the skin of the neck and arm, to the intercostal nerves, to the nerves of the joints and of the periosteum, to the nerves of the penis and clitoris, and tO' the mesenteric nerves. In cats they are often extremely abundant both in the mesentery and omenta, A Pacinian corpuscle can be seen by the naked eye, and looks like a minute grain from -Jjj-tk to A^th inch long. It is elliptical in form, and may either be sessile or attached to the nerve stem by a slender stalk. It consists of numerous lamellae of mem- brane-like connective tissue concentrically arranged, which form its capsule, and surround a central core of protoplasm. The outermost lamellae are more widely separated than the innermost, and a clear interlamellar fluid occupies the intervals. Numerous connective tissue corpuscles may be

PLA.CENTA. 877 sepiments, or with the general surface of the serotiua. These threads are without question the remains of that intra-placental arrangement of decidua, occurring so abun- dantly at the fifth month, but which has become attenuated aud atrophied, in the fully formed placenta, in correlation with the great expansion of the intra-placental maternal sinus system. A number of peculiarly tortuous arteries, continuous with the convoluted uterine arteries in the muscular wall, and named the curling arteries of the placenta, pierce the decidua serotiua, and open on its placental surface by obliquely directed mouths situated between the terminal branches of the villi attached to the decidua serotina. The decidua serotina is also traversed by dilated uteroplacental veins, which communicate with the venous sinuses in the muscular wall of the uterus. The utero-placental veins form in the decidua serotina a system of intercommunicat- ing sinuses. Some of these veins are prolonged into the decidual dissepiments between the placental lobes; others lie in the thickened border of the decidua surrounding the circumference of the placenta, where they form the so- called circular sinus of the placenta. Not only the circum- ferential, but the other utero-placental veins freely com- municate with the interior of the placenta, but their mode of opening into it is peculiar. Instead of possessing large patent mouths, the wall of the vein, where it lies in relation to the interior of the placenta, is perforated by one or more small apertures, so that it possesses a cribriform appearance; and not unfrequently a terminal offshoot of a placental villus may be seen to protrude through one of these small holes in the venous coat into the lumen of the veiu.

TEETH. 759 is produced from the epithelium, and the dentine, pulp and cement from the sub-epithelial connective tissue. The development of the temporary teeth will first be con- sidered. If a vertical section be made through the mouth of a young human embryo about the 6th or i th week, its cavity may be seen to be lined by a stratified epi- thelium, continuous with the layer of stratified epiblast forming the cuticle of the face. Along the edge of the gum, corresponding in position to that of the future jaws, Fig. 208.â€”Vertical transverse section through the Mouth of a young Human embryo, np, naso-palatine region; t, tongue; m, mouth; l, l, I, l, lips; (/, cl, primitive dental grooves with epithelial contents in upper gum; cl', d', similar structures in lower jaws; e, e, cuticular epiblast; h, h, hair follicles; e', epiblast prolonged into the mouth. the epithelium is of some thickness, and an involution of the epithelium into the subjacent connective tissue has taken place. Owing to this involution a narrow furrow or groove in the connective tissue is produced, which con- stitutes the primitive dental groove of Goodsir. This groove is not, however, an empty furrow, but is occupied by the involuted epithelium. The sub-epithelial connective tissue is soft and gelatinous, and abounds in corpuscles, which are especially abundant in the connective tissue at the

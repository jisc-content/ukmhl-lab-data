358 ANATOMY. but Giannuzzi and Boll have recently described a space between this network and the membrana propria which they believe to be continuous with the lymphatic system. Pfliiger has described nerves as terminating in connection with the secreting cells. The excretory ducts of the gland are from six to eight in number, and open on the back of the upper eye-lid, and the tears are washed over the surface of the globe by the involuntary winking of this lid. Fig. 106.—Outer wall of the Right Nose, to show the openings of the Kasai Duct and the Cranial Ah' Sinuses, a, sphenoid bone ; b, cribriform plate of ethmoid ; c, superior, middle, e, inferior turbinated; g, frontal sinus; h. sphenoidal sinus; £, superior, l, middle, m, inferior meatus; o, passage from frontal sinus into middle meatus; q, opening of nasal duct. When the secretion is increased in quantity, in the act of crying, the tears flow over the cheek, but in ordinary cir- cumstances they are conveyed away by two slender tubes, the lachrymal canals, which open by minute orifices, the puncta Ictchrymalia, one at the inner end of the free border of each eye-lid. These tubes open at their opposite ends into a small reservoir, the lachrymal sac, situated in a hollow in the lachrymal bone. From this sac a duct, the

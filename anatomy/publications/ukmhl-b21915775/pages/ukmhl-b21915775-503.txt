487 INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. ternal pudic. 4th, to muscles of buttock: gluteal and sciatic. 5th, to hip-joint and external obturator muscle : obturator a. Superior Vesical artery arises from the beginning of the hypogastric portion of the internal iliac artery, which has not altogether become obliterated ; it passes to the upper part of the bladder, which it supplies; it gives a branch to the vas deferens. b. Inferior Vesical artery runs to the lower part of the bladder, supplies it and the vesicular seminales ; one branch, also passes to the side of the prostate gland. From its distribution to the prostate, this branch is sometimes called the vesico-prostatic artery. c. Middle Hcemorrhoidal artery supplies a portion of the rectum in relation to the base of the bladder. It is often a branch of the inferior vesical artery. In the female, from the absence of the vesiculse semi- nales and prostate, the corresponding branches are absent; but in their stead are two arteries not present in the male, viz., a Uterine branch, which reaches the neck of the uterus, and ascends between the two layers of the broad ligament, to supply the uterus; also, a Vaginal branch, which is distributed to the walls of the vagina, the bladder, and rectum. d. Lateral Sacral artery usually consists of two branches which pass to the front of the sacrum, supply the pyri- formis muscle, and send twigs into the sacral canal through the anterior sacral foramina. e. Ilio-lumbar artery passes outwards behind the psoas into the iliac fossa, where it divides into a lumbar branch, which ascends to supply the muscles of the loins, and an iliac branch, which supplies the iliacus and gives a nutrien

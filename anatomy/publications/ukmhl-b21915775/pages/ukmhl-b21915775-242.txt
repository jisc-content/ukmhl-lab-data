ANATOMY. 226 part of this column is continuous with the posterior nerve roots and ascends to the restiform body and cerebellum. The fibres of the Anterior and Posterior Commissures have a horizontal course. Those of the anterior com- missure pass across the bottom of the anterior median fissure, where they decussate with the corresponding fibres from the opposite side. They consist apparently of fibres of the anterior nerve roots going to the opposite anterior column; of fibres arising in the anterior cornu going to the opposite anterior column; and of fibres from the pyramidal tract of the anterior column passing through the grey matter into the lateral column of the opposite side. The fibres of the jiosterior commissure, more deli- Fig 74 â€”1Transverse Section through the Central Canal, C, of the Cold, and its surrounding structures.

201 NERVOUS TISSUE. the bladder and elsewhere, have collections of nerve cells, forming microscopic ganglia lying in them. From these plexuses fibres arise which divide into delicate non- medullated fibres, possessing nuclei. These delicate fibres form still finer plexuses, which in their turn give origin to minute fibres, which pass between the muscular fibre cells to form a still more minute intramuscular network. Frankenhauser maintains that the delicate nerve fibrils which arise from this terminal network penetrate the muscular fibre cells, enter the nucleus, and terminate in the nucleolus; but Arnold considers that, after having entered the nucleus, the fibril again gives off a filament, which passes out of the cell to join the intramuscular plexus ; the ending of the nerve, therefore, within the nucleus is only apparent, and is rather to be regarded as the nodal point of a fine intra-nuclear plexus. The termination of the sensory nerves in the mucous membranes has been especially studied in the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of the soft palate, and the glans of the penis and elitoris. In these parts Krause discovered oval or globular end bodies, which consisted of a soft, homogeneous substance invested by a nucleated capsule of connective tissue. A nerve fibre pierces the capsule and terminates in the interior of the end-body, which forms a bulbous enlargement at the end of the nerve, and is called the end-bulb. After the nerve has entered the end-bulb, it may consist only of the axial cylinder and terminate in a pointed extremity, or it may twist upon itself and form a coil within the end-bulb. When the structure of the skin is described, it will be seen that the ending of the nerves in the cutaneous papillae bears a general resemblance to their termination in the end-bulbs of a mucous membrane.

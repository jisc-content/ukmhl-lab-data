ANATOMY. 216 or, more appropriately, the sub-dural space. Schwalbe, Axel Key and Ketzius have described the sub-dural space as communicating with the deep lymph-vessels and lymph- glands of the neck ; with the sub-dural spaces of the nerve roots and the lymph channels of the cranial and spinal nerves; with the venous sinuses around the Pacchionian bodies and with lymph-channels in the substance of the dura mater. Arachnoid mater.â€”The arachnoid is a non-vascular con- nective tissue membrane of great delicacy and transparency, which envelops both the brain and spinal cord. It is separated from these organs by the pia mater ; but between it and the latter membrane is a distinct space, called sub- arachnoid. The free surface next the sub-dural space is smooth and covered by a layer of squamous endothelium. The opposite surface is connected to the pia by threads and membranes of delicate sub-arachnoid connective tissue, which traverse the sub-arachnoid space' and divide it into numerous loculi freely communicating with each other. The connection is much closer opposite the summits of the convolutions than opposite the sulci between them, for the arachnoid does not dip between the convolutions: it is loose also opposite the interpeduncular space, and around the pons, medulla, and spinal cord, in which localities therefore the sub-arachnoid space is most distinct. The arachnoid is prolonged around the roots of the cranial and spinal nerves, and in the spinal region a mesial membranous band (septum posticum) connects the pia and arachnoid in the mesial plane posteriorly. Endothelial cells line the inner surface of the arachnoid, cover the outer surface of the pia, and invest the various bands and membranes which traverse the sub-arachnoid space. This space communicates

THE BRAINâ€”CEREBELLUM. 257 almost twice as large as in the embolus and corpus dentatum. The white medullary matter is for the most part directly continuous with the fibres of the peduncles of the cere- bellum. Thus the restiform or inferior peduncles pass from below upwards through the white core, to end in the grey matter of the tentorial surface of the cerebellum, more especially in that of the median lobe; on their way they are connected with the grey matter both of the corpus dentatum and of the roof nuclei. The superior peduncles, which descend from the corpora quadrigemina of the cere brum, reach the grey cortical matter, more especially on the inferior surface of the cerebellum, though they also form connections with the corpus dentatum. The middle peduncles form a large proportion of the white core, and their fibres terminate in the grey matter of the foliated cortex of the hemispheres. But, in addition to these peduncular fibres, which connect the cerebellum to other divisions of the encephalon, its white matter contains fibres proper to the cerebellum itself. The fibrse propriee have been especially described by Stilling; some, which he has termed the median fasciculi, lie near the mesial plane, and connect the grey matter on the tentorial aspect of the middle lobe with that of the inferior vermiform process, whilst others cross directly the mesialjplane to unite opposite and symmetrical regions of the hemispheres. Further, the auditory nerve is said by Foville and Meynert to derive a root through the restiform body from the cerebellum : Meynert also ascribes to a portion of the sensory root of the 5th cranial nerve a cerebellar origin through fibres in the superior cerebellar peduncle. The yrey matter of the cortex is divided into two well- R

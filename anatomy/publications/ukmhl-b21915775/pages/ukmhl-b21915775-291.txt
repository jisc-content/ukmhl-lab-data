THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. 275 continuous with each other, form collectively a superior tier. The convolution of the parietal eminence, the angular gyrus, the second annectent, and middle occipital gyri, are the members of a second or inferior tier, though their foldings are often so complex as to add materially to the difficulty of determining their continuity. The convolu- tions of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, again, are parallel to the horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure, below which they lie, and as they blend with the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe and with the middle and inferior occipital convolutions, they continue the posterior convolutions of the inferior tier downwards and forwards to the tip of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. In this manner the convolutions just referred to are so associated together as to be grouped around, and form, if one may so express it, a cap or hood, which encloses so effectually the convolutions of the central lobe or island of Eeil, that it is rare to find any of that structure exposed. It is by the great development of the inferior frontal gyrus, the lower ends of the two ascending convolutions, the con- volution of the parietal eminence, the angular and superior temporo-sphenoidal gyri, that the lips of the Sylvian fissure are so closely approximated, and that the island is com- pletely concealed within it. The Inner and Tentorial Surfaces of the Hemisphere. The convolutions on these surfaces have no relation to the bones of the cranial vault. They belong in part to the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and in part form a special arrangement in relation with the corpus callosum or great transverse commissure, which connects the two hemispheres. The wedge-shaped con-

158 ANATOMY. fibrils (Flemming), and in old cartilage it is coarsely granular, or even infiltrated with drops of oil. One or more nuclei are present in each cell, and the nuclei contain an intra-nuclear network of fibrils. Heidenhain has shown that powerful induction shocks cause contraction of the protoplasm of the cells towards the central nucleus. The cells lie in cavities in the matrix substance, and the part of the matrix which forms the immediate wall of the hollow is named the capsule of the cell. Two or more cells may sometimes lie in the same hollow. The matrix of hyaline cartilage appears to be homogene- ous. In some animals it has a concentric arrangement round the cells; and Rollett has stated that by the use of dilute sulphuric acid, or chromic acid, the matrix may be made to split up into concentric layers. Sometimes the matrix appears granulated, or even delicately fibrillated, a change which is very apt to occur in sections of cartilage which have been removed for some time from the body. In the costal cartilages of old persons the matrix becomes distinctly fibrous; and it is by no means uncommon to find in advanced age these bars of cartilage converted into bone. In the articular or encrusting cartilages the arrangement of the cells is quite distinctive. In a vertical section through this cartilage, the cells next the bone, forming a deep zone, are arranged in parallel rows perpendicular to the surface of the bone on which the cartilage rests; the cells are smaller than those of the costal cartilage, oblong in form, and both the cells in the same row and those in adjacent rows are separated by intermediate granulated matrix. Near the free surface of the cartilage, ie., in the superficial zone, the cells are flattened, placed parallel to

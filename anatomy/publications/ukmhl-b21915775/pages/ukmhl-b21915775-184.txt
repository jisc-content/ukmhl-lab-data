ANATOMY. 168 inarrow, again, is composed of fat cells lying in a delicate areolar tissue with accompanyingblood-vessels. The areolar tissue, which supports the marrow cells, and lines the medullary canal and cancelli, is named the i medullary membrane, or the endosteum. In the fresh bone the lacunae are not empty spaces as in the macerated bone. They are filled up by nucleated clumps of protoplasm, and are therefore, as Goodsir was the first to show, the seats of little masses of nucleated cells, which cells are the true bone-corpuscles. The protoplasm of these cells is apparently prolonged into the canaliculi. Hence the hard part of the osseous texture has within it a system of nucleated cells, some of which occupy the lacunae and canaliculi, while others form a liniug to the Haversian canals. The blood-vessels of a bone are abundant. It receives its arteries partly from the small arteries which ramify in the periosteum, Fig. 55.â€”Nucleated the fine branches of which enter the Haver- Branched Cells . . , . , occupying the la- sian canals, and form withm them an cnnse and canali- . cuii of a hone. anastomosing network of capillaries ; partly through a special artery which enters the nutrient canal in the bone, to be distributed chiefly to the marrow; partly through small arteries which enter openings in the compact tissue near the articular extremities. The veins of bones are also abundant. In the cancellated tissue they are large, and leave the interior of the bone partly through foramina situated near the articular ends, and partly by a vein which accompanies the artery that traverses the nutrient canal. In the plate-like bones of the skull the veins lie in distinct channels in the diploe,

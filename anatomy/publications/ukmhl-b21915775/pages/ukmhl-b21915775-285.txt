THE BRAIN—CEREBRUM. 269 Eig. 86. Figs. 85 and 86.—Profile and Vertex Views of Cerebrum. Fr, the frontal lobe; Par, parietal; Oc, occipital; Ts, temporo-sphenoidal lobe; SS, Sylvian fissure; RR, fissure of Rolando; PO, parieto-occipital fissure; IP, intra-parietal fissure; PP, parallel fissure; SF and IF, supero- and infero-frontal fissures: 1, 1, 1, inferior, 2, 2, 2, middle, and 3, 3, 3, superior frontal convolutions; 4, 4, ascend- ing frontal convolution; 5, 5, 5, ascending parietal, 5', postero-parietal, and 6, 6, angular convolutions; A, supra-marginal, or convolution of the parietal eminence; 7, 7, superior, 8, 8, 8, middle, and 9, 9, 9, inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions; 10, superior, 11, middle, and 12, inferior occipital convolutions; a, 0, y, S, four annectent convolutions. and consists, from above downwards, of three parallel con- volutions, named superior, middle, and inferior occipital, which are separated from each other by two fissures, j The Frontal Lobe forms the anterior and upper part of the cerebrum. It begins immediately in front of the fissure of Rolando, in a convolution named ascending frontal, which ascends obliquely backwards and upwards parallel and next to the fissure of Rolando, from the Sylvian to the longi-

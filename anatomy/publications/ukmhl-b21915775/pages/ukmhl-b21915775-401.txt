THE SKIN. 385 their apices, so that lymph channels lie between the cells for the transmission of a nutrient pabulum. The colouring matter of the skin is found in the cells of the mucous stratum, which in the fair races of men form the isolated coloured spots called freckles and moles, but in the dark races the pigment granules are uniformly distributed throughout the cells of this stratum. The superficial cells of the horny stratum of the cuticle are constantly being shed, so that the cells of the deeper layers gradually approach the surface, and new cells are continually being formed in the deeper part of the rete Malpighii by hori- zontal division of the layer of short columnar cells. The cuticle is closely adherent to the cutis in the healthy living skin, but on the application of a blister, or when putrefac- tion sets in after death, they separate from each other. The Cutis vera.—When the cuticle is removed the surface of the cutis is seen to be studded with multitudes of minute elevations, the papillae of the skin. These papillae are either simple conical structures, or compound with two or three branches. They are largest in the palm and sole, being from yl^th to yl„th of an inch high, and are arranged in ridges, but more usually they are much shorter and irregularly distributed. The cutis is formed of connective tissue, in which stellate connective tissue corpuscles and elastic fibres are abundant. The deeper surface of the connective tissue of the cutis is reticulated, and is continuous with the bundles of connective tissue that form the areolar subcutaneous tissue. In the papillae themselves the fibres of the connective tissue are not so well marked, and the surface of the papillae possesses more of a homogeneous aspect, which gives rise to the appearance described as a basement membrane. The cutis is highly vascular; the small arteries which go to the skin give off 2 B

FEMORAL ARTERY. 473 abdomen between the fascia transversalis and the peri- toneum ; it then enters the sheath of the rectus abdominis, and, continuing to ascend, supplies that muscle and inos- culates with the superior epigastric branch of the internal mammary artery. As it lies to the inner side of the internal or deep abdominal ring, the vas deferens, which passes through the ring in its course to the pelvis, turns behind the artery. It gives off transverse branches, which pass outwards to inosculate with the lower aortic inter- costal, lumbar, and deep circumflex iliac arteries : a cre- masteric branch to the coverings of the spermatic cord; a pubic branch runs inwards to the back of the pubes, inosculates with the obturator artery, and sometimes en- larges so as to form the origin of the obturator artery. b. Deep Circumflex Iliac artery arises from the external iliac close to Poupart’s ligament : it runs outwards behind that ligament to the iliac crest, supplies the muscles attached to the crest, also the iliacus, and inosculates with the lumbar, ilio-lumbar, and deep epigastric arteries. The Femoral artery is the direct continuation of the external iliac : it commences at Poupart’s ligament, runs down the anterior and inner aspects of the thigh, as far as the opening in the tendon of the adductor magnus muscle, where it becomes the popliteal artery. In this course the artery passes at first through the triangular space of Scarpa, from the middle of its base to its apex, and is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, and fascia lata, but at the base of the triangle it has an additional investment from the femoral sheath. Near the apex of Scarpa’s triangle 1 the artery goes under cover of the sartorius muscle, behind which it descends to its termination. For about three 2 H J-K tl VvM' ^

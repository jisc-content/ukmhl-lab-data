ANATOMY. 696 anastomosing arrangements in the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach. The veins of the stomach are root- lets of the portal vein. The lymphatics are numerous, and form a superficial and a deep set. The superficial run along the curvatures. The deep lymphatics arise in the gastric mucous membrane, where they form a network between the glands : they pierce the submucous and mus- cular coats, and join the superficial lymphatics. The nerves of the stomach are derived from the epigastric plexus of the sympathetic and from the pneumogastric nerves. The right vagus ends in the posterior wall of the stomach, the left in the anterior wall. Nerve cells are met with in relation to the nerves both in the muscular and submucous coats. INTESTINAL CANAL. The Intestinal Canal, Intestine, Gut, or Bowel, is situ- ated in the abdominal cavity, and extends from the pyloric opening, or gate, of the stomach to the orifice of the anus, where it opens on the surface of the body in the region of the perineum. In it the chyme becomes mingled with the bile, the pancreatic fluid, and the secre- tions of the intestinal glands, and is converted into chyle. In it also the absorption of the chyle takes place, and the insoluble part of the food is passed onwards to be excreted in the form of faeces. The intestine is the longest divi- sion of the alimentary canal, and measures on an average about twenty-five feet. It is primarily divided into two parts, called small intestine and large intestine; the length of the small is about twenty feet, that of the large about five feet.

19 AXIAL SKELETONâ€”THORAX. and an upper and lower border, but from the shaft being somewhat twisted on itself, the direction of the surfaces and borders is not uniform throughout the length of the bone. The ribs slope from the spine at first outwards, downwards, and backwards, then downwards and forwards, and where the curve changes from the backward to the forward direction an angle is formed on the rib. The 1st, 10th, 11th, and 12th ribs are distinctive; they articulate each with only a single vertebra, so that only a single surface exists on the head : the surfaces of the shaft of the 1st rib are almost horizontal; the upper surface and inner border have a ridge and tubercle, the scalene tubercle for the attachment of the scalenus anticus muscle, behind which is a groove for the subclavian artery, and in front a groove for the subclavian vein: the surfaces of the 2d rib are very oblique, and the outer is marked by a ridge for the serratus magnus muscle: the 11th and 12th ribs are rudimentary, have neither neck nor tubercle, and are pointed anteriorly. The ribs are by no means uniform in length : they increase from the 1st to the 7th or 8th, and then diminish to the 12th; the 1st and 12th are therefore the shortest ribs. The 1st and 2d costal cartilages are almost horizontal, but the others are directed upwards and inwards. In its general form the chest may be likened to a truncated cone. It is rounded at the sides and flattened in front and behind, so that a man can lie either on his back or his belly. Its truncated apex slopes downwards and forwards, is small in size, and allows of the passage of the windpipe, gullet, large veins, and nerves into the chest, and of several large arteries out of the chest into the neck. The base or lower boundary of the cavity is much larger than the apex, slopes downwards and backwards, and is occupied by the

THE SKIN. 387 deep surface of the cutis, where they divide into branches. As these pass towards the papillae they unite to form a nerve plexus, from which smaller branches arise to enter the papillae, and terminate, more especially in the skin of the palm of the hand, fingers, and sole, which are the surfaces most sensitive to touch impressions, in the tactile or touch corpuscles. The touch corpuscles discovered by Waguer and Meissner are the peripheral end-organs of the nerves of touch (fig. 114). They may be single or compound, and are usually ovoid in form, not unlike a miuute fir cone. Each corpuscle has an investing capsule of connective tissue, the nuclei in which are arranged transversely or obliquely. The capsule encloses a soft, delicate, granulated material which forms the substance of the corpuscle. Each siugle corpuscle and each division of a compound corpuscle is penetrated by at least one medullated nerve fibre. The sheath of the fibre joins the capsule of the corpuscle. Within the corpuscle the nerve fibre may branch, or run spirally, or divide into a bunch of non-medullated fibres, which, Krause says, may end either in points or in bulbous extremities. Virchow and other German observers have stated that the papillae which contain capillaries do not contain nerves or touch corpuscles, and vice versa; but Dalzell and Thin have shown that certainly the majority of papillae that contain nerve fibres and touch corpuscles are also vascular papillae. Non-medullated nerve fibres pass through the cutis into the rete Malpighii between the cells of the mucous layer (Langerhans). The hippocampus major and the gyrus hippocampi are apparently the cerebral centres for tactile impressions. Nails.â€”On the back of the last phalanx of each thumb, finger, and toe is situated a firm horny curved plate, the nail. Each nail rests on a bed, the surface of which is

MUSCULAR TISSUE. 181 lymph spaces outside the sarcolemma, which lie between it and the perimysium. If in the same fibre the processes of transverse and longitudinal splitting were to go on simultaneously, then the fibre would be resolved into an immense multitude of rectangular particlesâ€”the sarcous elements of Bowman. If these particles be regarded as the ultimate subdivisions of the fibre, then the discs may be conceived to be built up of a number of these sarcous elements possessing similar optical properties, arranged side by side, so as to occupy the entire diameter of the fibre in any transverse plane : whilst the fibrillse are built up of the sarcous elements arranged end to end, so as to correspond to the entire length of the fibre; but in the fibrillse particles with different optical properties, the one singly refracting, the other doubly refracting, alternate with each other with the utmost regularity. It is generally believed that the transverse striation indi- cates that the sarcous substance of the fibre is not a homo- geneous material, and that the alternating series of dark and light bands differ from each other physically, chemically, and optically. Briicke pointed out that the light bands refracted the light singly, were isotropic; whilst the dark bands refracted the light doubly, were anisotropic, and he conceived that this anisotropic material was built up of an aggregation of minute doubly refracting bodies, which he named disdialclasts. By some observers the broader dark bands are regarded as the proper sarcous or contractile portion of the fibre, and the intermediate narrower lighter bands as interstitial material cementing the broader dark discs together. Kuhne considers that this interstitial material, to which he gives the name of muscle plasma, is

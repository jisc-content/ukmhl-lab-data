ANATOMY. continued behind the spleniutn into the hippocampal or dentate fissure, which forms the upper boundary of the gyrus hippocampi. At the bottom of the hippocampal fissure the grey matter forms a well-defined denticulated edge, the fascia dentata, or dentate gyrus, and the fissure causes an elevation into the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, the hippocampus major. Extending along the hippocampus major is a white band, the fimbria,, or teenia hippocampi, and appearing below its free border is the lower end of the great transverse fissure of the cerebrum, through which the choroid plexus and pia mater are in- voluted towards the cavity of the lateral ventricle. Internal Parts of the Cerebrum. If a horizontal slice he removed from the ripper part of each hemi- sphere, the peripheral grey matter of the convolutions will he seen to follow their various windings, whilst the core of each convolution con- sists of white matter continuous with a mass of white matter in the interior of the hemisphere (centrum, ovale). If a slice he now made down to the plane of the corpus callosum, the white matter of that structure will he seen to he continuous with the white 'centre of each hemisphere. The Corpus Callosum does not equal the hemispheres in length, but approaches nearer to their anterior, than their posterior ends (fig. 90). It terminates behind in a free rounded end, the splenium, whilst in front it forms a knee- shaped bend, the genu, and passes downwards and back- wards, as the rostrum, as far as the lamina cinerea on the- base of the brain. It is thicker behind than in front, whilst the middle part, or body, is the thinnest. If the dissection be performed on a brain which has been hardened in spirit, the corpus callosum is seen to be composed of bundles of nerve fibres, which pass transversely across the mesial plane between the two hemispheres ; these fibres radiate into the white core and grey matter of the convolutions, and

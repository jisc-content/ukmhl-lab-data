ANATOMY. 234 found in connection with the nerves which supply the extremities, where, owing to the complexity of the muscular movements, the co-ordination of these movements through the nervous system is rendered necessary. The anterior divisions of the eight cervical nerves are arranged in two plexuses, named cervical and brachial. The Cervical Plexus is formed of the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th cervical nerves, which form a series of loops (fig. 76) in front of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, behind the sterno-mastoid and on the middle scalenus and levator scapulae muscles. Communicating, muscular, and cutaneous branches arise either directly from these nerves, or from the plexus which they form. Communicating brauches connect these nerves with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic cord, also with the vagus, spinal accessory, and hypoglossal cranial nerves, and with the descendens noni of the hypoglossal, these last from the 2d and 3d cervical being called communicantes noni. Muscular branches supply the anterior and lateral recti muscles of the neck, the levator scapulae, the middle scalenus, the diaphragm, and in part the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. The branch to the diaphragm or the phrenic nerve, is the most important; it springs from the 3d, 4th, and 5th cervical, and passes down the lower part of the neck, and through the thorax, to supply its own half of the diaphragm ; Luschka has described twigs proceeding from the phrenic to the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum. The Cutaneous branches are as follows:—the occipitalis minor, a branch of the 2d cervical to the skin of the occiput • the auriculo-parotidean, from the 2d and 3d cervical, to the skin over the parotid gland and the adjacent part of the auricle; the transversalis colli, also

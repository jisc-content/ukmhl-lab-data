ANATOMY. 436 the vertebral and internal jugular veins, the cardiac branches of the sympathetic and the right vagus nerve. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks behind it. The right subclavian vein lies below it, and the right pleura is below and posterior to it. Fig. 123.—The Right Subclavian Artery and its Branches. 1, Innominate artery; 2, common carotid; 3, vertebral branch of subclavian ; 4, thyroid axis; 5, inferior thyroid branch ; 6, transversalis colli; 7, superfieialis colli; 8, posterior scapular; 9, supra scapular; 10. superior intercostal; 11, deep cervical; 12, internal mammary; 13. in dotted outline shows the occasional origin of the posterior scapular from the third part of the subclavian; 15, ascend- ing cervical artery, a, 1st rib; b, scalenus anticus; c. thyroid gland; tf, phrenic nerve; e, pneumo-gastrie nerve; /, recurrent laryngeal nerve. The relations of the second and third parts of the sub- clavian arteries are the same on both sides. The second part lies upon the scalenus medius, and has the scalenus anticus, sterno-mastoid, cervical fascia, and platysma super- ficial to it; it is separated by the scalenus anticus from the subclavian vein and phrenic nerve ; above it are the nervous cords of the brachial plexus, and below is the pleura. The third part of the subclavian artery lies partly in the supra-clavicular triangle—a region bounded by the pos-

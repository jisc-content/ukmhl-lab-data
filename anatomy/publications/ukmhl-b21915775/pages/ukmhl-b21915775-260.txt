244 ANATOMY. The Brain or Encephalon. The Brain or Encephalon includes all the central nervous axis contained within the cavity of the skull. It is divided into medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellum, corpora quadrigemina, crura cerebri and cerebrum. The medulla oblongata is directly continuous with the spinal cord through the foramen magnum. The cerebellum lies above, and immediately behind the medulla oblongata, with which it is continuous. The pons lies immediately above the medulla, with which it is continuous. The corpora quadri- gemina lie above and in front of the cerebellum. The crura cerebri emerge from the upper surface of the pons. The cerebrum lies above all the other divisions, with which it is either directly or indirectly continuous. The Posterior Cerebral Vesicle gives origin to the Medulla Oblongata, Pons, and Cerebellum, whilst the 4th Ventricle is the axial canal of the modified vesicle. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The Medulla Oblongata or Bulb rests upon the basi- occipital. It is shaped like a truncated cone; about 1Â£ inch long, and 1 inch broad in its widest part. It is a bilateral organ, and is divided into a right and a left half by shallow anterior and posterior median fissures, continuous with the corresponding fissures in the spinal cord. Each half is subdivided into longitudinal tracts of nervous matter; but the tracts are not always the same throughout the whole length of the medulla. Next and parallel to the whole length of the anterior median fissure is the Anterior Pyramid; it is continuous below with the pyramidal

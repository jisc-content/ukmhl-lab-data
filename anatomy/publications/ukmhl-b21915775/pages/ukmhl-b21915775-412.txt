390 ANATOMY. overlap the pericardium, and lie between it and the sternum and costal cartilages. The pericardium is sepa- rated from the spine by the contents of the posterior mediastinum. It is attached below to the central tendon of the diaphragm, and blends above with the sheaths of the great vessels which pass to and from the heart. Two fibrous bands, the sterno-pericardiac ligaments of Luschka, are connected to its anterior surface; the superior ligament springs partly from the back of the manubrium, and is partly continuous with the cervical fascia; whilst the inferior ligament proceeds from the inner side of the base of the xiphisternum. Structure.—The pericardium is formed externally of a strong fibrous membrane, which is attached .by areolar tissue to the dia- phragm, the wall of the (Esophagus and the at- tached surface of the two pleurae. When the pericardium is cut open its inner sur- face is seen to possess a smooth, free, glistening, serous aspect, similai to the inner surface of the dura mater. This is due to the interior of the bag being lined by a single layer of squamous endothelium. II here the fibrous membrane of the pericardium is prolonged on to the aorta, the pulmonary artery and veins, and the venae cavae, the serous endothelial lining of the bag Fig. 115.—The Heart within the Pericar- dium. The clotted line represents the arrangement of the serous layer; e. the epicardium; p, the pericardium; D, the diaphragm.

133 EPITHELIUM. and some other mucous surfaces, they are â€˜ irregular in size, and elongated into short columns. The cells next the free surface have a tendency to be shed, and they are replaced by the cells of the deeper layers, which become modified in form as they become superficial. Epithelium is distinguished by being devoid of blood-vessels, i.e., it is non-vascular; and also, with some exceptions, devoid of nerves, i.e., non-sensitive. Epithelium is divided into the squamous, columnar, ciliated, transitioned, glandular, and nervous varieties. The epithelial cells, whether arranged in one or several strata, rest upon a subjacent tissue, which, from its relation to the cells, may be called sub-epithelial. The sub-epithelial tissue is a form of the fibrous variety of connective tissue, to be subsequently described, and in it lie the nerves, the blood and lymph vessels, and the involuntary muscular tissue of the skin and mucous membranes; hence it is sometimes described as a fibro- vascular tissue or corium. It was for a long time believed that, between the deeper surface of the epithelium and the corium, a definite, homogeneous, continuous membrane, named by Bowman a basement membrane, intervened, which formed a sharp line of demarcation between the epithelial and the sub-epithelial tissue. Bowman, however, himself admitted that in some of the localities where this membrane was theoretically supposed to exist it could not satisfactorily be demonstrated. Sometimes, however, a layer of flattened cells intervenes between the epithelium and sub-epithelial connective tissue, and assumes a membrane-like appearance (Debove). H. Watney has described in the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, a delicate reticulum of connective tissue as prolonged between the epithelial cells.

153 ADIPOSE TISSUE. other localities where it occurs, it is intimately associated with tb e connect]' ve tissue. It consists of cells, which vary in size from ^th to -^th inch, usually ovoid or spherical in form, though when collected into masses they may be laterally compressed. These cells are sometimes isolated, though most usually arranged in rows or clusters to form lobules of fat. The number of cells in a given lobule varies with the size of the lobule. The distinctive contents of these cells is a minute drop of oil, which, when examined by transmitted light, presents a bright ap- pearance ; so that the fat cells look when seen by reflected light, as Monro primus described long ago, like a cluster of pearls. Each fat cell possesses a distinct wall, as r _ _ Fig. 44.â€”Fat Cells can be readily demonstrated by digesting 31111 Areolar Tissue, these cells in ether, when the oil is dissolved out and the membranous wall remains. The nucleus of the fat cell is more difficult to demonstrate, and, when seen, is found attached to the inner surface of the cell wall. In the fat of old persons, and in specimens of this tissue which have been removed from the body for a length of time, a stellate group of acicular crystals is not unfre- quently to be seen in the interior of the cell, which consist either of margarin or margaric acid, one of the constituents of human fat. The lobules of fat cells lie in the areolae of the areolar variety of connective tissue, which forms their supporting framework, and they are also surrounded by a network of capillary vessels, which serve to convey to them blood for their nutrition, and aid in retaining them in position.

668 ANATOMY. tensor palati is believed to be a dilator of the tube. The levator palati is also regarded by some as a dilator, but Cleland maintains that it acts as a constrictor by approxi- mating the membranous to the cartilaginous wall of the tube. The mucous membrane of the soft palate is continuous with that of the mouth and pharynx. The epithelium covering the anterior or oral surface is a stratified pavement epithelium. That on the posterior or pharyngeal surface appears to vary at different periods of life; for whilst Klein found in the infant a laminated cylindrical and ciliated epithelium, with isolated areas of pavement epithelium, in adults the surface generally was covered by a laminated pavement epithelium. Numerous racemose mucous glands lie beneath the mucous membrane, but much more abun- dantly on the oral than on the pharyngeal aspect. Collec- tions of lymphoid tissue, similar to those found in the tonsils, are also met with. The arteries are the descending palatine branches of the internal maxillary, the inferior palatine of the facial, and palatine branches of the ascend- ing pharyngeal. The veins of the soft palate often assume a dilated character, and are continuous with the pharyn- geal veins. Lymphatics are also distributed beneath the mucous membrane. There are difficulties in determining with precision the motor nerves of the soft palate. A branch from the otic ganglion of the third division of the fifth nerve passes to the tensor palati. The levator palati and azygos uvulas are by some considered to be supplied by the pharyngeal branches of the vagus, though others regard them as supplied by the large superficial petrosal of the facial,

383 THE TONGUE. lingual nerve is the chorda tympani, which is also believed to be associated with the sense of taste. It is doubtful if it derives its taste fibres directly from the 7th; for it may receive them from the glosso-pharyngeal through the connections of the tympani branch of that nerve with the superficial petrosal nerves, and of these with the geniculate ganglion of the portio dura of the 7th. The cerebral centre for the sense of taste has been placed by Ferrier in the tip of the middle temporo-sphenoidal convolution. The mucous membrane of the tongue contains numerous small tubular or branched glands, more especially on the dorsum near its root, which secrete mucus. Depressions also occur in this part of the mucous membrane, around which lymphoid cells are collected in the sub-epithelial connective tissue; these cells are arranged as in the ad- jacent tonsils, and form an adenoid or lymphoid tissue. | Development op Tongue. The tongue arises as a bud-like process on the floor of the mouth of the embryo. It consists of mesoblast covered by the epiblast layer which lines the buccal chamber. From the epiblast is produced the epithelial covering, and in all probability the gustatory bulbs, whilst the mesoblast gives rise to the muscular, fibrous, vascular, and nervous structures. The Skin. The Skin, or Integument, invests the entire outer surface of the body, and contains structures by the excitation of which the properties of things are determined by the sense of touch. The skin also contains accessory structures, as the nails, hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The skin consists of a non-vascular cuticle or epidermis, and of a vascular and sensitive corium, or cutis vera. The Cuticle, Epidermis, or scarf skin, forms the outer covering of the skin, and protects the cutis. It is a lami- nated structure, and consists of numerous layers of cells

84 ANATOMY. by the platysma, inserted into the outer surface of the body and the mylo-liyoids, into its inner surface. The elevators of the jaw are much more powerful than the depressors, for they not only have to overcome the weight of the bone, but during mastication have to exercise force sufficient to cut or break down the food between the teeth. In carnivorous animals, such as the tiger or hyaena, which crack the bones of their prey, these muscles attain a great size. The lower jaw can be projected in front of the upper by the external pterygoids, inserted into the neck of the bone and the interarticular meniscus on each side; but excessive movement forward is checked by the action of the stylo-maxillary ligaments, which pass from the styloid processes to the angles of the bone: when projected forward, the jaw is drawn back by the posterior fibres of the temporales. When the elevator, depressor, protractor, and retractor muscles are successively brought into action, the lateral or grinding movements of the bone, so important in mastication, are produced. Along with the movements of the lower jaw those of the hyoid bone and larynx must be considered, for the digastrics, the genio- and mylo-hyoids, which, when their fixed ends are at the hyoid, depress the lower jaw, act, when their mandibular ends are fixed, along with the stylo-hyoids in elevating the hyoid and larynx. The hyoid and larynx are depressed or drawn downwards by the action of the sterno-hyoids, sterno-thyroids, thyro-hyoids, and omo- hyoids. The elevation of the hyoid, when drawn down by its depressor muscles, is also effected by the elastic stylo- hyoid ligaments attached to its small cornua, which, by their recoil when the depressor muscles have ceased to contract, draw the bone up to its former position.

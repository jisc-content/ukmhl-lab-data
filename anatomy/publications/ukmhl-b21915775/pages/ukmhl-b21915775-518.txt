ANATOMY. 502 SYSTEMIC GROUP OF VEINS. The Systemic group of veins consists of the coronary venous system; the system of the superior vena cava; the system of the inferior vena cava; and associated with the inferior vena cava is the portal venous system. Coronary Venous System. The Coronary venous system consists of the veins of the heart, or the cardiac veins. The Cardiac veins arise from the capillaries of the coronary arteries in the substance of the muscular wall of the heart. Those which arise in the ventricles run on the anterior and posterior surfaces, from the apex to the auriculo-ventricular groove, where they open into the great coronary vein, and possess valves at their orifices. This vein runs in that groove on the back of the heart, where it dilates into a sinus—the coronary venous swims—which opens into the right auricle, between the mouth of the inferior cava and the right aurieulo-ventricular orifice. Veins from the wall of the left auricle open into the great coronary vein, but the veins from the wall of the right auricle for the most part open directly into its cavity at the foramina Thebesii. One vein which passes obliquely from the wall of the left auricle into the sinus is the remains of the left superior vena cava of the embryo. System of the Superior Vena Cava. The Superior or Descending Vena Cava collects and conveys to the right auricle of the heart the blood which circulates in the head, neck, upper limbs, and the walls of

The muscles which act on the crico-thyroid joints are the pair of crico-thyroid muscles and the pair of thyro- arytenoid muscles. The Crico-thyroid muscle arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage as far forward as its anterior middle line; its fasci- culi pass backwards and upwards, and are inserted into the lower border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior border of its inferior cornu. The two crico- thyroids diverge from each other, and leave uncovered the middle division of the crico-thyroid mem- brane.

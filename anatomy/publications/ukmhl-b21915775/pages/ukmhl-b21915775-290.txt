ANATOMY. 274 ment, and the fissure of Rolando be taken as the starting line, it will be seen that a well-defined convolution extends in the vertical transverse direction immediately in front of, and a second immediately behind, that fissure, from the margin of the longi- tudinal fissure down- wards and outwards to the fissure of Syl- vius. These are the ascending frontal and parietal gyri. From the anterior of these gyri the convolutions extend in the postero-an- terior direction to the anterior end of the cerebrum, and form the three tiers (more or less dis- tinct in different in- dividuals) of frontal convolutions. From „ . _ _ Fig. 88.—Orbital Surface of the Left Frontal Lobe the posterior of these and the Island of Reil; the tip of the temporo- r sphenoidal lobe has been removed to display the i I'Vri also convolll- latter. 17, gyrus rectus ; 0, olfactory fissure over bJLl> cusu, cuuvuiu wWch the olfactory peduncle and lobe are situated; TR, tri-radiate fissure ; 1" V", convolutions on the orbital surface; 1, 1, 1. 1, under surface of infero- frontal convolution , 4, under surface of ascend- ing frontal, and 5, of ascending parietal convolu- tions ; C, central lobe or insula. tions extend in the antero-posterior di- rection as far as the posterior end of the cerebrum, but their separation into tiers is not so clearly marked as in the anterior group.

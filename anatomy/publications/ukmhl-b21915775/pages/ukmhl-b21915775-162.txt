ANATOMY. 146 flattened plates imbedded in a soft mucin yielding inter- cellular sub stance. Some- times the in- tercellular sub- stance is in part differen- tiated into short delicate fibres. Round' ed colourless cells, like white Fig. 3S.â€”Gelatinous Connective . Tissue. The fusiform, Klnnrl rounded, and stellate cells, and the partial differentia- 1Jiuuu euipus- tion of the intercellular substance into fibres,;are shown. c2eg also found in this tissue. Under some pathological conditions, this form of tissue increases largely in quantity in some parts of the body, and forms a kind of tumour named Myxoma. d. iibrous connective tissue presents three principal modifications in appearance. It may be loose, flocculent, and filamentous, and contain small spaces or areolae (when it is called areolar tissue), as is well seen in the sub cutaneous tissue of the adult, and in the omenta. It may be expanded in the form of a fibrous membrane, as in the fasciae or aponeuroses, and the threads or fibres, strong and well marked, sometimes run parallel, sometimes cross each other at various angles. It may be collected into rounded or flattened bands, as in tendons and ligaments, where it forms the tendinous and ligamentous tissues. Here also the threads or fibres may be distinctly recognized and seen to run in parallel bundles, so as to connect together the two structures between which the tendon or ligament passes. In the fibrous connective tissue, both cells and inter

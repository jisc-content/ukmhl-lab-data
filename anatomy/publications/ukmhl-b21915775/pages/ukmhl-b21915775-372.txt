356 ANATOMY. upper and a lower, which protect the front of the globe. Between each pair of lids is a horizontal fissure, the palpebral fissure. From the free margins of the two lids project short hairs, the eye-lashes or cilia: the upper set curve downwards and forwards, the lower set upwards and forwards; they also protect the front of the globe. Each eyelid consists externally of skin, with sebaceous glands and sweat glands ; immediately beneath the skin are the fibres of the orbicular sphincter muscle ; a thin plate of fibro-car- tilage, the tarsal cartilage, lies beneath the sphincter; to the inner end of this cartilage a fibrous band, the tendo palpebrarum, is attached, which springs from the ascending process of the superior maxilla; into the cartilage in the upper eye-lid the tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris is inserted. Lining the inner surface of the eye-lid is the conjunctiva. Between the conjunctiva and the tarsal car- tilage is a layer of glands, the Meibomian glands ; each gland consists of a short duct, which expands at its sides into small sacculi. The sacculi contain short columnar cells; these secrete a sebaceous material, which escapes through the orifice of the duct at the border of the eye-lid, and by greasing the edge of the eye-lid prevents the over- flow of the tears, except when lachrymation is profuse. The Conjunctiva is a mucous membrane, which forms the posterior layer of the eye-lid, and is reflected on to the anterior part of the sclerotic. At the inner angle of junction of the eye-lids is a soft reddish elevation of the conjunctiva, the caruncula lachrymalis, and immediately external to it is a vertical fold, the plica semilunaris, the rudiment of the third eye-lid seen in many mammals, or the membrana nictitans, so well developed in birds. The palpebral conjunctiva has small papillae scattered over its surface; its epithelium is stratified, with scaly cells on the

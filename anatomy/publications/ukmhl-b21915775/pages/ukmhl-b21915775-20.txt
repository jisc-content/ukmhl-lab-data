4 ANATOMY. indeed, the only living creature that can walk or stand erect, i.e., with the axis of the spine vertical; with the hip and knee joints capable of being fully extended, so that the leg is brought into line with the thigh; with the foot so planted on the ground that it rests on the heel be- hind and on the roots of the toes in front; with the upper limbs so ar- ranged as to act, not as instruments of support and progression, but of prehension; and with the head so balanced on the top of the spine that the face and eyes look directly to the front. His bones, joints, and muscles are constructed and arranged so as to enable him to preserve the erect atti- tude without fatigue. In other verte- brata the axis of the spine is oblique or horizontal, the hip and knee joints- are permanently bent at a more or less acute angle, the limbs, corre- sponding to the human upper extrem- ities, are, in the form of legs, wings, Fig. i.—Diagrammatic Sec- or fins, instruments of progression, tion through the Human . .

THE EAR. 371 scalse communicate with each other through a small hole, the helicotrema. As the scala vestibuli opens into the osseous vestibule, the perilymph is continued into it, and through the helicotrema into the scala tympani. The ductus cochlearis is the membranous cochlea, and its walls Fio. 110.â€”Tranverse section through the tube of the Cochlea, m, modiolus'; 0, outer wall of cochlea; SV, scala vestibuli; ST, scala tympani; DC, ductus cochlearis; mR, membrane of Roissner; bm, basilar membrane; cs, crista spiralis; si, spiral ligament; sg, spiral ganglion of auditory nerve; oc, organ of Corti. are formed of the basilar membrane next the scala tympani, of the membrane of Reissner next the scala vestibuli, of the spiral ligament next the outer wall of the cochlea, and of the crista spiralis next the osseous spiral lamina. It follows the spiral windings of the cochlea, terminates at the apex of the spiral in a closed end, whilst at the base it

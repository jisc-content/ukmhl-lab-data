NERVOUS TISSUE. 195 Nerve fibres may therefore be regarded as prolongations of the nerve cells with which they are continuous. Nerve cells are distinctly nucleated; the nuclei are usually large, and contain one, and often two distinct nucleoli. The cell substanee is granular and fibrillated, like the axial cylinder of the nerve fibres ; not unfrequently brown or yellow pigment is collected around the nucleus. A cell wall is sometimes apparently present, though at others it cannot be demonstrated. The nerve cells in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord are imbedded in the neuroglia. In the smaller nerve centres, as the sympathetic ganglia and the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, the nerve cells are surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Frantzel, Kolliker, and others have described this capsule as lined by an endothelium formed of flattened cells. Nerve cells with only a single process, called unipolar cells, are the characteristic cells in the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves of most vertebrates. This process often bifurcates in a T-like manner, and each branch becomes continuous with a nerve fibre (Ranvier). Nerve cells from which two poles or pro- cesses proceed are called bipolar. Char- acteristic specimens of these cells, as was first pointed out by Robin and R. Wagner, may be recognised without difliculty in the fiq. gs.-bi polar ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal twoVLrve\bres nerves of fishes. Ihese cells usually pos- it, from the spinal i i i i i , , . ganglion of a sess a globular body, though sometimes it skate. may be elongated ; and from opposite points of the surface of the body a strong process is given off, which is directly

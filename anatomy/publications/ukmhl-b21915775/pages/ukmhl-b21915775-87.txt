ARTICULATORY AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS. 71 mg the mode of action of the muscles, the place of insertion of the muscle into the bone—that is to say, the point of application of the power which causes the movement—and its relations to the joint, or fulcrum, or centre of motion, and to the weight or resistance which is to be overcome, have to be kept in view. The relative positions of fulcrum, point of application of power, and resistance, are not the same in all the bony levers. As a rule, the muscles are in- serted into the bones between the fulcrum and the movable point of resistance, and nearer the fulcrum than the mov- able point, as may be seen in the biceps and brachialis anticus which bend the fore-arm at the elbow-joint (lever of 3d class). Although from the weight-arm of the lever being in these cases much longer than the power-arm, the muscles, as regards the application of the power, act at a disadvantage, yet the movement gains in velocity. Some- 7 times the muscle is inserted, as is the case in the triceps which straightens or extends the fore-arm, at one end of the lever, and the fulcrum or joint is placed between it and the movable point (lever of 1st class). At other times, as in the case of the depressor digastric muscle of the lower jaw, whilst it is attached to one end of the lever, the fulcrum is at the opposite end (lever of 2d class). When a muscle is so placed that its tendon of insertion is perpen- dicular to the bone to which it is attached, it acts to great advantage; when placed oblicpiely or nearly parallel, a loss of power occurs. Many muscles at the commencement of contraction lie obliquely to the bones which they move, but as contraction goes on they become more nearly per- pendicular, so that they act with more advantage near the close than at the commencement of contraction. If a muscle passes over only one joint, it acts on that joint

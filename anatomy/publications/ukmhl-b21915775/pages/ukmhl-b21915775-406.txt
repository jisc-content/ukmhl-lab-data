ANATOMY. 390 largely and strongly serrated. The bristles of the pig, again, have the fibrous part of the hair largely developed. In the deer tribe the hair consists of polygonal medulla-like cells, which contain air. The root of the hair dilates at its deeper end into a bulb which embraces the hair papilla. It is softer in texture than the shaft, so that the cellular structure of the hair is more easily seen. Next the papilla the cells are like those of the rete Malpighii, but in the shaft they are differentiated, both in structure and com- position, into the proper hair cells. The hair papilla bears to the hair the same relation as a papilla of the cutis has to its investing cuticle, so that a hair is a specially modified cuticular structure. The human hair papilla is vascular. Nerves have been traced into the wall of the hair follicle, but not into the hair papilla. In the tactile hairs of the mammalia, however, nerves have been traced into their papillae. The bristles, feathers, claws, hoofs, the horny envelope of the horn cores in the hollow horned ruminants, and various tegumentary spines and scales, present in many animals, are, like hairs and nails, special modifications of the tegumentary system. Each hair follicle has opening into it the excretory duct of one or more small glands named Sebaceous Glands. Each gland consists of an excretory duct, and of from two to twenty grape-like saccular expansions or acini which open into the duct. The wall of the sacculi and of the duct is continuous with the vitreous layer of the outer wall of the hair follicle. Capillary blood-vessels and lymph-vessels are distributed on the outer wall of the sacculi. The sacculi are almost entirely filled with polygonal cells containing drops of fat, which cells aro continuous with the epithelial lining of the gland duct and the cells of the

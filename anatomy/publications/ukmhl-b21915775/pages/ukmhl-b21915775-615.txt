MUSCLES OF LARYNX. 599 The crico-thyroid muscles increase the tension of the vocal cords. As to the mode in which this tension is occasioned there is a difference of opinion. It is usu- ally believed that the crico-thyroid muscles rotate the thyroid cartilage about a transverse axis, passing horizon- tally through the two crico-thyroid joints, and de- press the anterior border of the thyroid cartilage so as to ■elongate the vocal cords in front. But some anatomists hold that the thyroid cartilage is fixed by the action of the thyro-hyoid muscles, that the crico-thyroid muscles then rotate the cricoid cartilage on the thyroid, by drawing the front of the cricoid cartilage upwards, which depresses the back of the cricoid and the arytenoid cartilages, and I'ig. 16G.—Diagram of the Rima Glottidis, to illustrate the action of the muscles on it.

The thyro- arytenoid muscles approximate the opposite ends of the vocal cords, and thus relax them, by drawing the thyroid

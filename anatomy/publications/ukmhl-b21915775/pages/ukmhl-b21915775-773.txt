757 TEETH. off, and the nutrition of the tooth being at an end, it loosens in its socket and drops out. When the tooth is in its socket, the reticulated connective tissue of the alveolo- dental periosteum is closely attached to the outer surface of the cement. Osteo-dentine and Vaso-dentine do not exist as normal structures in human teeth, though they occur in various animals. They may appear, however, as abnormalities in the human teeth, and are found on the inner wall of the pulp cavity. Osteo-dentine is a mixture of dentine structure, with lacunae and canaliculi. If vascular canals, like the Haversian canals of bone, are formed in it, then the name vaso-dentine is applied. Tue Pulp of the tooth is one of its most important con- stituents. It is a soft substance occupying the cavity in the dentine, or the pulp cavity, and is destroyed in a macerated and dried tooth. It consists of a very delicate gelatinous connective tissue, in which numerous cells are imbedded. Those which lie at the periphery of the pulp are in contact with the dentine wall, and form a layer, named by Kolliker the membrana eboris. As the cells of this layer play a part in the formation of the dentine, similar to that performed by the osteoblast cells in the formation of bone, Waldeyer has named them odonto- blasts. The odontoblasts are elongated in form, and their protoplasm gives off several slender processes : some enter dentine tubes to form the soft dentinal fibres already de- scribed ; another passes towards the centre of the pulp, to become connected with more deeply-placed pulp cells, whilst others are given off laterally to join contiguous cells of the odontoblast layer. The pulp contains the

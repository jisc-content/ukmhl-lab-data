GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON CELLS. 121 limiting membrane, and whilst a portion of its substance is extruded from the ovum as the polar cell or cells, the rest remains within the egg as the female pro-nucleus. The head of the spermatozoon which enters the ovum forms the male pro-nucleus. The male and female pro-nuclei fuse with each other and produce the segmentation nucleus, which divides along with the surrounding yelk protoplasm, first into two, then four, then eight, then sixteen segments, and so on in multiple proportion. Each segment is therefore a nucleated mass of protoplasm—is, in short, a nucleated cell, and the protoplasm of these cells exhibits the property of contrac- tility. The ovum or germ-cell is thus the immediate parent of all the new cells which are formed within it, and mediately it is the parent of all the cells which, iu the subsequent processes of development and growth, are descended from those produced by the segmentation of the yelk. The process of development of young cells within a parent cell, whether it occurs in the ovum or in a cell derived by descent from the ovum, is called the endogenous reproduction of cells. Another mode of multiplication of cells is by budding: little clumps of protoplasm bud out from the protoplasm of the parent cell, become detached, and assume an independent vitality. If a nucleus differen- tiates in the interior of such a clump, it becomes a cell; if it remains as a mere clump of protoplasm, it is a cytode. These methods of multiplication are all confirmatory of Schwann’s generalisation of the descent or derivation of cells from pre-existing cells. But as the nucleated cell, either with or without a cell wall, is not, in the present state of science, regarded as the simplest and most elementary unit capable of exhibiting vital phenomena, and as these phenomena can be displayed by individual

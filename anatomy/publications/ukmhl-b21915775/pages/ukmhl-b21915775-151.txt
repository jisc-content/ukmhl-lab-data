In the formation of this epithelium a morphological differentiation of the protoplasm of the cells of the deeper strata into flattened scales, and at the same time a chemical differentiation of their soft contents into a horny material, have occurred. Columnar or cylindrical epithelium is situated on the free surface of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, from the oesophageal orifice of the stomach to the anus, and is prolonged into the ducts of various glands which open on the alimentary mucous membrane; it covers the mucous lining of the urethra, vas deferens, mammary ducts, and gall bladder. The cells are elongated columns, about -g-0o-th inch long, placed side by side like a 'row of palisades, and with the long axis per- Fig. 31.—Columnar Epithelium.

Sometimes the cells are uniformly cylindrical; at other times they are compressed at the sides; at others they are more conical,—the base or broad end, rounded or polygonal, forming the free surface of the membrane which they cover; the apex or attached end being attenuated and next the sub-epithelial tissue. The nuclei are oval, and both they and the cell protoplasm are granular and contain a network of fine fibrils. The columnar cells have a clear hem or border at their broad free ends, which in the cells covering the intestinal villi is streaked with fine parallel lines (fig. 31, C). Intermingled with the columnar epithelial cells of the intestine are cup- shaped chalice or cjoblet cells, which seem mostly empty, or

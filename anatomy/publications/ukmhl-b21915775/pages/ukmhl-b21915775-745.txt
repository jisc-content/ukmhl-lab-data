A short distance to the right of that part of the longi- tudinal fissure in which the round ligament lies, is the fossa for the gall hladcler, which is a depression on the under surface of the right lobe extending from the anterior border to the transverse fissure : in it the gall bladder lies. Extending somewhat obliquely from the posterior border of the liver, towards the transverse fissure, is a deep fossa for the inferior vena cava, which lodges this great vein before it pierces the diaphragm. Sometimes the vena cava is bridged across by a prolongation of the liver substance. Opening into the vena cava as it lies in this fossa are the trunks of the large hepatic veins from the substance of the liver. A portion of liver substance, which is bounded by the gall bladder, the longitudinal fissure, the transverse fissure, and the anterior border, forms a four-sided lobe called lobus quadratus. Another portion, bounded by the transverse fissure, the posterior border, the vena cava, aud the longitudinal fissure, is the lobus Spigelii. A thin prolonga- tion of liver substance continuous with the lobus Spigelii, and running obliquely between the fossa for the inferior cava and the transverse fissure, is the lobus caudatus. The lobus caudatus is rudimentary in the human liver, but, as W. H. Flower has pointed out, attains a considerable mag- nitude in many mammals. He has named the fissure, which separates it from the adjacent part of the right lobe, the fissure of the caudate lobe. To the right of the fossae for the gall bladder and inferior cava are two shallow depressions on the under surface of the right lobe; the more anterior marks the position of the hepatic flexure of the colon, the more posterior, the upper end of the right 3 A

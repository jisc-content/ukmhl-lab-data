593 INTERIOR OP LARYNX. sular ligament, lined by a synovial membrane (figs. 161, 163.) The cornicula are formed of yellow fibro-cartilage. The Cuneiform cartilages, or Cartilages of Wrisberg, are two thin plates of yellow elastic cartilage, placed one in each aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane. Interior of the Larynx. The tube of the larynx, or the glottis, communicates above withThe pharynx, and below with the trachea. The superior opening of the larynx is somewhat triangular in form, with the base in front and the apex behind. It is bounded in front by the epiglottis; on each side by the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane • behind by the cornicula laryngis, the apices of the arytenoid car- tilages, and the fold of mucous membrane passing between them. The inferior opening is circular in form, like the tube of the trachea, with which it is continuous. The mucous lining of the larynx is elevated into folds, which correspond in position to the false and true vocal cords; the arrangement of the cords may be seen when the larynx is looked into through its superior opening, or when a mesial incision is made longitudinally through the posterior wall, and the two sides of the tube slightly sepa- rated from each other (fig. 163). Two pairs of vocal cords may then be seen extending, one above the other, at the sides of the mesial plane, in the antero-posterior direction from the thyroid to the arytenoid cartilages. The superior pair, or the false vocal cords, consist of thin fibres attached anteriorly to the retreating angle of the thyroid cartilage, and posteriorly to the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage : these fibres are covered by a fold of the mucous

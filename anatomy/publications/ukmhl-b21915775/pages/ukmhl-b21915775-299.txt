283 THE BRAINâ€”CEREBRUM. ' If the corpus callosum be now divided about its middle by a trans- verse incision, and the posterior half of this structure be turned back, the body of the fornix on which the corpus callosum rests is exposed. If the anterior half of the corpus callosum be now turned forward, the grey partition, or septum lucidum, between the two lateral ventricles is exposed. When the septum is removed, the anterior part of the for- nix is brought into view. The Septum Lucidum fits into the concavity of the knee of the corpus callosum, which bounds it above, in front and below, whilst behind it is bounded by the anterior pillars of the fornix and the anterior commissure. It consists of two thin vertical laminae, a right and a left, originally continuous with the inner surface of the hemi- spheres. Each lamina consists of a grey and a white layer, and the fibres of the latter are connected with those of the fornix. The outer white surface of each lamina forms the inner wall of the lateral ventricle in front of the foramen of Monro, and is covered by its ependyma; the inner grey surface bounds the 5th ventricle, The Fifth Ventricle is a mesial cleft-like space, situated between the two laminae of the septum lucidum. It is not continuous with the other ventricles, and was originally a part of the great longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum, which has been separated from that fissure by the development of the corpus callosum. The Fornix or arch is an arch-shaped band of nerve fibres extending in the antero-posterior direction. It consists of two lateral halves, one belonging to each hemi- sphere. At the summit of the arch the two lateral halves are conjoined to form the body; anterior to the body the two halves separate from each other, and form two rounded anterior pillars, which descend in front of the third ventricle and foramen of Monro, and behind the septum

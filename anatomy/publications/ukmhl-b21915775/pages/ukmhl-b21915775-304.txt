ANATOMY. 288 forms the wall of the cerebral end of the cerebro-spinal tube. a, The grey matter of the cortex of the. hemisphere forms the superficial part of the convolutions, and is known as the great hemispherical ganglion, but in some localities, as the loci perforati antici and the septum lucidum, it has received distinctive names. When a convolution is divided vertically, the grey matter is seen to be confined to the surface and to enclose a white core. The grey matter pre- sents a laminated appearance, and is as a rule divided into five or six layers, which consist of nerve cells, nerve fibres, matrix or neuroglia, and blood-vessels. The neuroglia is present in all the layers and contains multitudes of minute rounded or elliptical corpuscles lying in a finely reticulated matrix, and sometimes small stellate cells with branched processes are found, the protoplasm of which is so pellucid that the nuclei seem as if free (Meynert). The grey cortex is about five times as vascular as the white matter. The arteries and veins, enclosed in a funnel-shaped sheath of pia mater (p. 219), lie vertically in the grey matter. Some arteries end in a rich capillary plexus, within the grey matter; others of larger size give off branches to join the capillaries in the grey matter, and then enter the white matter, where they form a comparatively scanty capillary plexus. The 1st, superficial or molecular layer consists largely of neuroglia, in which nerve fibres extend parallel to the surface of the convolutions. The 2nd, or small pyramiclal-cell layer contains multitudes of pyramidal nerve cells, characteristic of the cerebral cortex; they lie with their long axes vertical to the surface of the convolutions; their apices are directed to the first layer, and according to Cleland are continuous with its horizontal fibres.

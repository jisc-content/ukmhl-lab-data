126 ANATOMY. tttb^1 iâ€™1 Anguis frcigilis to T5XS .th in Laceria viridis. In amphibia the largest corpuscles, according to Gulliver, are about inch in length in Proteus and Siren, though Eiddell states that in Amphiuma tridactylum they are Id larger; whilst the smallest, as in the common frog, average in length x^jg- inch. In cartilaginous fish the corpuscles are larger than in osseous; e.g., in Lamna cornubica Gulliver found their long diameter to be yA-g- inch ; while in the Salmonidse, which have the largest blood discs among osseous fish, the long diameter in the salmon and common trout is only about T-^o inch- The red blood corpuscles in all vertebrata, except the mammalia, are nucleated clumps of protoplasm; they are therefore minute cells. In mammals, owing to the absence of a nucleus, they do not accord with the definition of a cell given on p. 119, and they are not therefore morpho- logically identical with the red corpuscles in other verte- brates. What their precise homology may be is somewhat difficult to say, owing to the obscurity which prevails as to their exact origin. If they are merely clumps of specially modified protoplasm, budded off from the white corpuscles, then they are cytodes. If, as some have supposed, they are the nuclei of the white corpuscles, specially modified in composition, then they are free nuclei. If, again, they are the white corpuscles, the cell substance of which has undergone a special differentiation, and the nucleus has disappeared, then they are potentially cells, though no nucleus is visible. Whatever may be their exact homology, there can be no doubt that the non-nucleated mammalian red corpuscle, and the substance of the nucleated red cor- puscle which lies outside the nucleus, are functionally identical with each other; the protoplasm having in both

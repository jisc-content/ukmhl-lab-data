365 THE EAR. The bones are moved on each other at these joints by small muscles. The tensor tympani arises from the apex of the petrous temporal, the ali-sphenoid and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube; it enters the tympanum through the canal in its anterior wall, and is inserted into the handle of the malleus near its root. The laxator tympani arises from the spine of the sphenoid, and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube; it enters the tympanum through the Glaserian fissure, and is inserted into the neck of the malleus. The stapedius arises within the pyramid, enters the tympanum through the hole at its apex, and is inserted into the neck of the stapes. The tympanum is lined by a mucous membrane, continuous with that of the Eustachian tube, which also invests the tympanic ossicles, ligaments, and muscles, and is prolonged backwards so as to line the mastoid air-sinuses. The epithelium covering this mem- brane, on the floor and the adjacent part of the anterior, posterior, and internal walls, is ciliated and columnar; but the epithelium on the roof, the promontory, the mem- brani tympani, and the tympanic ossicles, is tessellated. In the sub-epithelial connective tissue the blood and lymph vessels and nerves of the tympanum ramify. The auricle and external meatus are well adapted for collecting and transmitting sound-vibrations inwards to the middle ear and labyrinth. These vibrations strike the membrana tympani, and are propagated by the chain of bones across the tympanic cavity to the labyrinth. The pressure of the vibrations on the tympanic membrane forces that membrane inwards, so that its inner surface presses on the handle of the malleus, the effect of which is to rotate the hammer about its axis. By the ligamen- tous attachment of the malleus to the tympanic walls and to the incus, and, as Helmholtz has shown, by the inter-

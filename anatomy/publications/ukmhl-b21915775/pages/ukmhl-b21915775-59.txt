APPENDICULAR SKELETON—UPPER LIMB. 43 four; the scaphoid, semilunar, and unciform each with five; and the os magnum with seven. Occasionally a nintli or supernumerary bone may arise from the divi- sion of the scaphoid, semilunar, or trapezoid into two pieces, or from a separate ossification of the styloid process of the 3d metacarpal: more rarely a distinct bone is found in the human wrist intercalated be- tween the trapezoid, os magnum, semilunar, and scaphoid, which cor- responds in position to the os centraie, found constantly in the wrist of the orang, gibbon, the tailed apes, and many rodents and insectivora. The Metacarpal bones, or bones of the Palm of the Hand, are five in number (fig. 9). They are miniature long bones, and each possesses a shaft and two extremities. The meta- carpal of the thumb is the shortest, and diverges outwards from the rest: its carpal extremity is saddle-shaped, for articulation with the trapezium; its shaft is somewhat compressed, and its phalangeal end is smooth and rounded, for the first phalanx of the thumb. The four other meta- carpal bones belong to the four fingers; they are almost parallel to each other, and diminish in size from the 2d to the 5th. The 1st, 3d, and 5th metacarpals articulate, each with a single carpal bone, viz., the 1st with the trapezium, the 3d with the os magnum, the 5th with the unciform. The 2d metacarpal articulates with three carpals—the trapezoid, trapezium, and os magnum. The 4th metacarpal with two carpals,—the os magnum and unciform. The 3d and 4th metacarpals articulate on each side with the contiguous metacarpals : the 2d and 5th on one side only, viz., the 2d on its inner side with the 3d metacarpal, and the 5th on its outer side with the 4th; the 1st does not articulate with any metacarpal. (See page 53.) The number of Digits in the hand is five, which is the highest number found in the mammalia. They are distinguished by tho names of Pollex or thumb, and Index,

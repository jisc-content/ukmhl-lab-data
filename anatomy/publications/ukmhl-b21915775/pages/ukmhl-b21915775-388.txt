ANATOMY. 372 communicates with the sacculus of the membranous vesti- bule by a slender tube, the canalis reuniens; hence the membranous cochlea contains endolymph. The termina- tion of the cochlear branches of the auditory nerve and the arrangement of the peripheral end-organs in relation to them are to be looked for in the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane is a thin layer of connective tissue, covered on its tympanic surface by a layer of branched cells. On the surface, directed to the ductus cochlearis, a remarkable arrangement of cells exists, which presents an appearance that ha3 been compared with the key-board of a pianoforte, and has been named the organ ofCorti ; it consists of the following parts :â€”Some of these cells, distinguished by their elongated curved form, are arranged in two groups, an inner and an outer. The cells of the inner group rest by a broad foot on the inner part of the basilar membrane, close to its attachment to the spiral lamina, project obliquely forwards and outwards, and expand into a dilated head : the cells of the outer group also rest by a broad foot on the same membrane, incline forwards and inwards, fit into a depression in the head of the cells of the inner group, and give off a flattened process outwards : these two groups of cells form the rods or pillars of Corti, and by their juxtaposition arch over an excessively minute canal, enclosed between them and the basilar membrane, which may be named the canal of Corti. The inner rods are more numerous, but not so long as the outer, and Pritchard has shown that the rods increase in length from the base to the apex of the cochlea. A nucle- ated mass of protoplasm is in contact with both the foot and head of both the inner and outer rods. Immediately internal and almost parallel to the inner group of these rods, and adjacent therefore to the crista spiralis, is a single

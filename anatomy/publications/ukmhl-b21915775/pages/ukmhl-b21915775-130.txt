ANATOMY. 114 muscles of the muscular tissue, tlie nervous system of the nervous tissue, fibrous membranes of the fibrous or con- nective tissue, &c. But though the essential constituent of each organic system is a tissue peculiar to that system, yet in most localities certain other tissues are mingled with that which is to be regarded as the characteristic texture of the part. In a muscle, for example, not only is the muscular tissue present, but mingled with it are connective tissue, nerve tissue, blood-vessels, and lymph-vessels. A gland also consists not only of its proper tissue, the secreting cells, but of more or less connective tissue, nerves, blood and lymph-vessels, and gland ducts. Indeed, there are few localities in which, along with the proper tissue of the part, blood and lymph-vessels, nerves and connective tissue, are not found; and to a part built up of two or more tissues the term Organ is applied. Thus the muscular system consists of the series of organs which we call the muscles, the glandular system of the several organs called glands, and so on. Each tissue and each organ, into the construction of which that tissue enters as the charac- teristic texture, possesses both distinctive structural and distinctive functional properties. Thus the muscular tissue is characterised by the property of contractility, and the muscles, of which it forms the essential texture, are organs of motion or locomotion; the osseous tissue is characterised by its hardness and strength, and the bones, of which it forms the essential texture, are organs of support and protection. But the study of the textures embraces not only an in- quiry into the special structural, and functional properties of each tissue and organ—into the special part which each plays in the animal economy—but the consideration of their

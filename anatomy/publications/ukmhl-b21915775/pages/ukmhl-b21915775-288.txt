ANATOMY. 272 suture. The inner table of the cranial bones is an almost exact mould of the convolutions of these lobes; but this is not so with the exterior of the skull, the configuration of which is modified by the formation of ridges and processes Fig. 87.â€”Side view of the Brain in the sluiU.1 1 The above view of the brain in situ, shows the relations of the sur- face convolutions to the regions of the skull. R, fissure of Rolando, which separates the frontal from the parietal lobe. PO, parieto-oeci- pital fissure between the parietal and occipital lobes. SS, fissure of Sylvius, which separates the teinporo-sphenoidal from the frontal and parietal lobes. The frontal area lies in front of the coronal suture. SF, MF, IF, the supero-, mid-, and infero-frontal subdivisions of the frontal area of the skull; the letters are placed on the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions ; the inferior frontal region is separated from the middle frontal by the frontal part of the curved line of the temporal ridge; the mid- from the supero-frontal by a line drawn backwards from the upper margin of the orbit through the frontal eminence. SAP, the supero-antero-parietal area of the skull; S is placed on the ascending parietal convolution, AP on the ascending frontal convolution. IAP, the infero-antero-parietal area of the skull; I is placed on the ascending parietal, AP on the ascending frontal con- volution. 8PP, the supero-postero-parietal area of the skull j the S\v

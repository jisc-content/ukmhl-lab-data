CCELIAC AXIS. lesser omentum, is in relation with the ductus communis choledocus and portal vein, the duct lying to the right of the artery, and the vena portas behind. Its branches are the Pyloric. Gastro-duodenalis Cystic. Gastro-epiploica dextra. Pancreatico-duodenalis. 223.â€”The Cceliac Axis and its Branches, the Liver having been raised, and the Lesser Omentum i-emoved. r 1} The pyloric branch arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descend^ to the pyloric end of the stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, supplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric artery. The gastro-duodenalis is a short But large branch, which descends behind the duodenum, near the pylorus, and divides at the lower border of the stomach into two branches, the gastro-epiploica dextra and the pancreatico-duodenalis. Previous to its division, it gives oif two or three small inferior pyloric branches to the pyloric end of the stomach and pancreas. The gastro-epiploica dextra runs from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum, anastomosing about the middle of the lower border of this organ with the gastro-epiploica sinistra from the splenic artery. This vessel gives oiF numerous branches, some of which ascend to supply both surfaces of the stomach, whilst others descend to supply the great omentum.

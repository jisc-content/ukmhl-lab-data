ARTERIES. 392 The pancreatico-duodenalis descends along tlie contiguous margins of the duodenum and pancreas. It supplies both these organs, and anastomoses with the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. In ulceration of the duodenum, which frequently occurs in connexion with severe burns, this artery may be involved, and death may occur from hsemorrhage into the intestinal canal. The cystic artery, usually a branch of the right hepatic, passes upwards and forwards along the neck of the gall bladder, and divides into two branches, one of which ramifies on its free surface, the other, between it and the substance of the liver. 224.—The Cccliac Axis and its Branches, the Stomach having been raised, and the Transverse Meso-Colon removed. The Splenic Artery, in the adult, is the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, and is remarkable for the extreme tortuosity of its course. It passes horizontally to the left side behind the upper border of the pancreas, accompanied by the splenic vein, which lies below it; and on arriving near the spleen, divides inta branches, some of which enter the hilus of that organ to be distributed to its structure, whilst others are distributed to the great end of the stomach. The branches of this vessel are:— Pancreaticfe parvte. Pancreatica magua. Gastric (Vasa brevia). Gastro-epiploica sinistra.

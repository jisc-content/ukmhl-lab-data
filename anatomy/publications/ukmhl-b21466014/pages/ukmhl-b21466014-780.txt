SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 742 extending the limb, or rotating it outwards, and to be relaxed on flexing the limb and inverting it: hence the necessity of placing the limb in the latter position in employing the taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia. The iliac portion of the fascia lata, together with its falciform process, should now be removed, by detaching it from the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, carefully dissecting it from the subjacent structures, and turning it aside, when the sheath of the femoral vessels is exposed descending beneath Poupart's ligament (fig. 384). The Crural Arch, or Pouparfs Ligament, is the lower border of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle, which stretches across from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, to the spine of the os pubis and pectineal line; the portion corresponding to the latter insertion, is called Gimbernaf s ligament. Its direction is curved downwards towards the thigh; its outer half being oblique, its inner half nearly horizontal. Nearly the whole of the space included between the crural arch and innominate bone is filled in by the parts which descend from the abdo- men into the thigh. The outer half of the space is occupied by the Iliacus and Psoas muscles, together with the external cutaneous and anterior crural nerves. The pubic side of the space is occupied by the femoral vessels included in their 384.â€”Femoral Hernia. Ihac Portion of Fascia Lata removed, and Sheath of Femoral Vessels and Femoral Canal exposed. sheath, a small oval-shaped interval existing between the femoral vein and the inner wall of the sheath, which is occupied merely by a little loose areolar tissue, and occasionally by a small lymphatic gland; this is the crural canal, along which a portion of gut descends in femoral hernia.

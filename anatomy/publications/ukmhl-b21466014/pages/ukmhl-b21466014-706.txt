668 THE THORAX. it is longer, narrower, and more curved than that of the right side, and its mar- gins more deeply indented, presenting a kind of foliated appearance. Its direction is forwards and towards the right side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary In order to examine its interior, a horizontal incision should be made along the attached border of the auricle to the ventricle; and from the middle of this, a second incision should be carried upwards. The following parts then present themselves for examination: The pulmonary veins, four in number, open, two into the right, and two into the left side of the auricle. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common opening. They are not provided with valves. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is rather smaller than the corresponding opening on the opposite side. The rmisculi pectinati ai'e fewer in number and smaller than on the right side; they are confined to the inner surface of the appendix. On the inner surface of the septum auricularum may be seen a lunatcd impres- sion, bounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of which is turned upwards. This depression is just above the fossa ovalis in the right auricle. The Left Ventricle is longer and more conical in shape than the right ven- tricle. It forms a small part of the left side of the anterior surface of the heart, and a considerable part of its posterior surface. It also forms the apex of the artery. The openings of the four pulmonary veins. Auriculo-ventricular opening. Musculi pectiuati. 353-â€”The Left Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed.

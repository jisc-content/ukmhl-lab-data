EIGHTH PAIR. 527 muscles connected with it, to the lower border of the Stylo-pharyngeus. The nerve now curves inwards, forming an arch on the side of the neck, and lying upon the Stylo-pharyngeus and the 284.- -Course and Distribution of the Eighth Pair of Nerves. Middle constrictor of the pharynx, above the superior laryngeal nerve. It then passes beneath the Hyo- glossus, and is finally dis- tributed to the mucous membrane of the fauces, and base of the tongue, the mucous glands of the mouth and tonsil. In passing through the jugular foramen, the nerve presents, in succession, two gangliform enlargements. The superior, the smaller, is called jugular gang- lion, the inferior and larger, the petrous ganglion, or the ganglion of Andersch. The superior, or jugu- lar ganglion, is situated in the upper part of the groove in which the nerve is lodged during its pas- sage through the jugular foramen. It is of very small size, and involves only the outer side of the trunk of the nerve, a small fasciculus passing beyond it, which is not connected directly with it. The inferior, or petrous ganglion, is situated in a depression in the lower border of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone; it is larger than the for- mei", and involves the whole of the fibres of the nerve. I'rom this ganglion arise those filaments Avhich con- nect the glosso-pharyngeal with other nerves at the base of the skull. Its branches oj com- munication are with the pneumogastric, sympathe- tic, and facial, and the tympanic branch. The branches to the pneumogastric are two filaments, one to its auricular branch, and one to the upper ganglion of the pneumogastric. The branch to the sympathetic is connected Avith the superior cervical ganglion.

274 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE. for the passage of a communicating branch between the superficial and deep veins. The muscles of the forearm may be subdivided into groups corresponding to the region they occupy. One group occupies the inner and anterior aspect of the forearm, and comprises the Flexor and Pronator muscles. Another group occupies its outer side; and a third, its posterior aspect. The two latter groups include all the Extensor and Supinator muscles. Front of the Left Forearm. Superficial Muscles. Antekior Brachial Region Superficial Layer. i/^-- Pronator radii teres. Flexor carpi radialis. Palmaris longus. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Flexor sublimis digitorum. These muscles take origin from the internal condyle by a common tendon. The Pronator Radii Teres arises by two heads. One, the larger and more superficial, arises from the humerus, inmiediately above the internal condyle, and from the tendon common to the origin of the other muscles; also from the fascia of the forearm, and inter- muscular septum between it and the Flexor carpi radialis. The other head is a thin fasciculus, which arises from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, joining the preceding at an acute angle. Between <Sie two heads ' passes the median nerve. The muscle passes obliquely across the forearm from the inner to the outer side, and terminates in a flat tendon, which turns over the outer margin of the radius, and is inserted into a rough ridge at the middle of the outer surface of the shaft of that bone. Relatiojis. By its anterior surface, witli the deep fascia, the Supinator longus, and the radial vessels and nerve. By its posterior surface, with the Brachialis anticus. Flexor sublimis digitorum, the median nerve, and ulnar artery; the small, or deep, head being interposed between the two latter structures. Its outer border forms the inner boundary of a triangular space, in which is placed the brachial artery, median nerve, and tendon of the Biceps muscle. Its inner border is in contact with the. Flexor carpi radialis. The Flexor Carpi Radialis lies on the inner sid'^iiof tlie, preceding muscle. It arises from the internal condyle by the common tendon, from the fascia is^f the forearm, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the Pronator ter^s, on

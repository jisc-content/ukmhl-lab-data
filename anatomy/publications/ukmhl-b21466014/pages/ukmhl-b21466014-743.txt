URETHRA. 705 subjacent tissue. It is eiglit or nine lines in length, and a line and a half in height; and contains, according to Kobelt, muscular and erectile tissues. When distended, it may serve to prevent the passage of the semen backwards into the bladder. On each side of the verumontanum is a slightly depressed fossa, the prostatic sinus, the floor of which is perforated by numerous apertures, the orifices of the prostatic ducts, the ducts of the middle lobe opening behind the crest. At the fore part of the verumontanum, in the middle line, is a depression, the sinus pocularis {vesicula prostatica); and upon or within its margins are the slit-like openings of the ejaculatory ducts. The sinus pocularis forms a cul-de-sac about a quarter of an inch in length, which runs upwards and backwards in the sub- stance of the prostate, beneath the middle lobe; its 2:)rominent upper wall partly forms the verumontanum. Its walls are composed of fibrous tissue, muscular fibres, and mucous membrane; and numerous small glands open on its inner surface. It lias been called by Wel)er, who discovered it, the uterus masculinus, from its supposed homology with the female organ. The Membranous portion of the urethra extends between the apex of the prostate, and the bulb of the corpus spongiosum. It is the narrowest part of the canal (excepting the orifice), and measures three-quarters of an inch along its upper and half an inch along its lower surface, in consequence of the bulb projecting backwards beneath it below. Its upper concave surface is j^lf-ced about an inch beneath the pubic arch, from which it is separated by the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis, and some muscular fibres. Its lower convex surface is separated from the rectum by a triangular space, which constitutes the i^erinjEum. The membranous portion of the urethra perforates the deep perineal fascia; and two layers from this membrane are prolonged round it, the one forwards, the other backwards; it is also surrounded by the Compressor urethras muscle. Its coverings are mucous membrane, elastic fibrous tissue, a thin layer of erectile tissue, muscular fibres, and a prolongation from the deep perineal fascia. The Spongy portion is the longest part of the urethra, and is contained in the corpus spongiosum. It is about six inches in length, and extends from the ter- mination of the membranous portion to the meatus urinarius. Commencing below the symphysis pubis, it ascends for a short distance, and then curves downwards. It is narrow, and of uniform size iu the body of the penis, measuring about a quarter of an inch in diameter; being dilated behind, within the bulb, where it forms the bulbous portion; and again anteriorly, Avithin the glans penis, forming the fossa navicularis. A cross section of this canal in the body of the penis has its long diameter transvei'se; but in the glans, that diameter is directed vertically. The meatus urinarius is the most contracted part of the urethra; it is a vertical slit, about three lines in length, bounded on each side by two small labia. The inner surface of the lining membrane of the urethra, especially on the floor of the spongy portion, presents the orifices of numerous mucous glands and follicles, situated in the submucous tissue, and named the glands of Littre. They vary in size, and their orifices are directed forwards, so that they may easily intercept the point of a catlieter in its jjassage along the canal. One of these lacunte, larger than the rest, is situated on the upper surface of the fossa navicularis, about an inch and a half from the orifice; it is called the lacuna magna. Into the bulbous portion are found opening the ducts of Cowper's glands. Structure. The urethra Is composed of three coats: a mucous, muscular, and erectile. The mucous coat forms part of the genito-urinary mucous membrane. It is continuous with the mucous membrane of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys; externally, Avith the integument covering'the glans penis; and is pi-olonged into lithe ducts of the glands which open into the urethra, viz., Cowper's glands, the I prostate gland, and the vasa deferentia and vesicuUe scminales, through the ejaculatory ducts. In the spongy and membranous portions, the mucous membrane is arranged in longitudinal folds when the organ is contracted. Small papillie are

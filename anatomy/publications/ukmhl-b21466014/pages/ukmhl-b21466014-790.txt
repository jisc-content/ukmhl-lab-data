752 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINJEUM. The superficial and transverse perinseal arteries are described at p. 404; and the superficial periuaial and inferior pudendal nerves, at pp. 558, 560. The muscles of the perinseum in the female are, the Sphincter vaginae. Compressor urethrte. Erector clitoi-idis. Sphincter ani. Transversus perinsei. Levator ani. Coccygeus. The Sphincter VagincB surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urin^ in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perineum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass - forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller - than it. The Transversus Perincei is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vaginee, and the Levator ani into the side of the vagina. The other muscles are precisely similar to those in the male. The Accelerator urinse and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinseal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb ; and on either side is tlie crus penis, connecting the corpus caveruosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. 391.â€”Deep Perinseal Fascia. On the left side, the anterior layer has been removed. The Deep Perinceal Fascia (triangular ligament), is a dense membranous lamina, which closes the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. It is triangular in shape, about an inch and a half in depth, attached above, by its apex, to the under surface of the symphysis pubis and subpubic ligament; and, on each side, to the rami of the ischium and pubes, beneath the crura penis. Its inferior

In front, it is bounded by the frontal, malar, and great wing of the sphenoid: externally, by the zygomatic arch, formed conjointly by the malar and temporal bones; below, it is separated from the zygomatic fossa by the pterygoid ridge, seen on the outer surface of the great 64..â€”Side View of the SkuU. wing of the sphenoid. This fossa is formed by five bones, part of the frontal, great wing of the sphenoid, parietal, squamous portion of the temporal, and malar bones, and is transversed by five sutures, the transverse facial, coronal, spheno- parietal, squamo-parietal, and squamo-sphenoidal. It is deeply concave in front, convex behind, traversed by grooves which lodge branches of the deep temporal arteries, and filled by the Temporal muscle. The Mastoid Portion of the side of the skull is bounded in front by the anterior root of the zygoma; above, by a line which runs from the posterior root of the zygoma to the end of the masto-parietal suture; behind and below, by the masto- occipital suture. It is formed by the mastoid and part of the squamous portion of the temporal bone; its surface is convex and rough for the attachment of muscles, and presents, from behind forwards, the mastoid foramen, the mastoid process, the external auditory meatus, surrounded by the auditory process, and, most anteriorly, the glenoid fossa, bounded in front by the eminentia articularis, behind by the vaginal process. The Zygomatic Foss^. The Zygomatic fossa is an irregularly-shaped cavity, situated below, and on the inner side of the zygoma; bounded, in front, by the tuberosity of the superior

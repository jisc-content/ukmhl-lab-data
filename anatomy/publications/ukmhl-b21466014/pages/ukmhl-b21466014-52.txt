OSTEOLOGY. ninth has two demi-facets on each side, then the tenth has a demi-facet at the upper part; none below. The Tenth Dorsal has an entire articular facet on each side above; no demi- facet below. In the Eleventh Dorsal, the body approaches in its form and size to the lum- bar. The articular facets for the heads of the ribs, one on each side, are of large size, and placed chiefly on tJie pedicles, which are thicker ^nd stronger in this and the next vertebra, than in any other part of the dorsal region. The transverse processes are very short, tubercular at their extremities, and have no articular facets for the tubercles of the ribs. The spinous process is short, nearly horizontal iu direction, and presents a slight tendency to bifurcation at its extremity. 6.â€”Peculiar Dorsal Vertebrse. ^ The Twelfth Dorsal has the same general characters at the eleventh; but may be distinguished from it by the inferior articular processes being convex and

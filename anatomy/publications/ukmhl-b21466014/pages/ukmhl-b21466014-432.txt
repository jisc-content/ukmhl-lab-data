ARTERIES. 394 the right iliac fossa, where it divides into two branches. Of these the inferior one inosculates with the lowest branches of the vasa intestini tenuis, from the convexity of which branches proceed to supply the termination of the ileum, the coccum and appendix cojci, and the ileo-coccal and ileo-colic valves. The superior division inosculates with the colica dextra, and supplies the commencement of the colon. The colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the supe- rior mesenteric artery, and passing beneath the peritoneum to the middle of the ascending colon, divides into two branches; a descending branch, which inoscu- lates with the ileo-colic; and an ascending branch, which anastomoses with the colica media. These branches form arches, from the convexity of which vessels are distributed to the ascending colon. The branches of this vessel are covered with peritoneum only on their anterior aspect. 225.â€”The Superior Mesenteric Artery and its Branches. The colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and, passing forwards between the layers of the transverse meso-colon, divides into two branches; the one on the right side inosculating with the colica dextra; that on the left side, with the colica sinistra, a branch of the inferior Mesenteric. From the arches formed by their inosculation, branches are dis- tributed to the transverse colon. The branches of this vessel lie between two layers of peritoneum.

OSTEOLOGY. 26 The Occipital Bone. The Occipital Bone (fig. 22) is situated at the back part and base of the cranium, is trapezoid in form, curved upon itself, and presents for examination two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. The External Surface is convex. Midway between the summit of the bone and the posterior margin of the foramen magnum is a prominent tubercle, the external occipital protuberance, for the attachment of the Ligamentum nucha3; and descending from it, as far as the foramen, a vertical ridge, the external occipital crest. This tubercle and crest vary in prominence in different skulls. Passing outwards from the occipital protuberance on each side are two semi-circular ridges, the superior curved lines; and running parallel with these from the middle of the crest, are the two inferior curved lines. The surface of the bone above the superior curved lines is smooth on each side, and, in the recent state, is covered by the Occipito-frontalis muscle, whilst the ridges, as well as the surface of the bone between them, serve for the attachment of numerous muscles. 22.â€”Occipital Bone. Outer Surface. The superior curved line gives attachment internally t(jt the Trapezius, externally to the Occipito-frontalis, and Sterno-cleido-mastoid, to the extent shewn in fig. 22; the depressions between the curved lines to the Complexus internally, the Splenius capitis and Obliquus capitis superior externally. The inferior curved line, and the depressions below it, afford insertion to the Eectus capitis posticus, major and minor. The foramen magnum is a large oval aperture, its long diameter extending from before backwards. It transmits the spinal cord and its membranes, the spinal accessory nerves, and the vertebral arteries. Its back part is wide for the transmission of the cord, and the corresponding margin rough for the attachment

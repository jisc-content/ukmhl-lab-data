Posterior Surface. divided by a vertical ridge into two lateral halves ; the ridge is well marked at its commence- ment at the oblique line, but becomes gradually indistinct be- low ; the inner and broader half gives attachment to the Flexor longus digitorum, the outer and narrower, to part of the Tibialis posticus. The remaining part of the bone is covered by the Tibialis posticus, Flexor longus digito- rum and Flexor longus pollicis miifscles. Immediately below the oblique line is the medullary foramen, which is directed ob- liquely downwards. The Lower Extremity, much smaller than the upper, jwesents four surfaces ; it is prolonged downwards, on its inner side, into a strong process, the internal malleolus. The inferior surface of the bone is quadrilateral, and smooth, for articulation with the astragalus. Tliis surface is narrow internally, where it be- malleolus, broader externally, and traversed from before back- wards by a slight elevation, se- parating two lateral depressions. The anterior surface of the lower extremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor mu^ cles of the toes ; its lower margin presents a rough trans- verse depression, for the attacli- iiient of the anterior ligament of the*iCjtle joint : the posterior surfack^ pi'esents a superficial groove irec+ed obliquely down- wards ^ ii wards, continuous with, a vVila- groove on the 'posterior e^tfenl,ty of the astra- ' galus, and sei ^ng or the passage of the tendoi. the Flexor longus pollicis ^,^ti>t> external \ surface present' triangular rough depression fot^thf attach- ment of the inferior interosseous ligament connecting itwiti the fibula: the lower par\ of vhj^, depression is smooth ,'8.^oi.'e bones, covered with c/rtila^« ii.

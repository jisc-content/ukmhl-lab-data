375 BRACHIAL. 218.â€”The Surgical Anatomy of the Brachial Artery, the inner border of the Coraoo- brachialis and Biceps muscles. In the upper part of its course, this vessel lies internal to the humerus; but below, it is in front of that bone. Relations. This artery is super- ficial throughout its entire extent, being covered, in front, by the in- tegument, the superficial and deep fascia; the bicipital fascia separates it opposite the elbow from the me- dian basilic vein; the median nerve crosses it at its centre; and the basilic vein lies in the line of the artery, but separated from it by the fascia, in the lower half of its course. Behind, it is separated from the inner side of the humerus above, by the long and inner heads of the Triceps, the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery inter- vening; and from the front of the bone below, by the insertion of the Coraco-brachialis and the Brachialis anticus muscles. By its outer side, it is in relation with the commence- ment of the median nerve, and the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps muscles, which slightly overlap the arteiy. By its inner side, its upper half is in relation with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, its lower half with the median nerve. It is accompanied by two venae comites, which lie in close contact with the artery, being connected together at intervals by short transverse communicating branches. / Infer car Kl'rofiL'Tida Plan of the Relations of the Brachial Arteky.

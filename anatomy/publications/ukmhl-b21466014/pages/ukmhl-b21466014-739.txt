Contents. The viscera contained in this cavity are the urinary bladder, the lower end of the rectum, and some of the generative organs peculiar to each sex; they are partially covered by the peritoneum, and supplied with blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves. The Bladder. The bladder is the reservoir for the urine. It is a musculo-membranous sac, situated in the pelvis, behind the pubes, and in front of the rectum in the male, the uterus and vagina intervening between it and that intestine in the female. The shape, position, and relations of the bladder are greatly influenced by age, sex, and the degree of distension of the organ. During infancy^ it is conical in shape, and projects above the upper border of the pubes into the hypogastric region. In the adult, when quite empty and contracted, it is a small triangular sac, placed deeply in the pelvis, flattened from before backwards, its apex reaching 368.â€”Vertical Section of Bladder, Penis, and Urethra. as high as the upper border of the symphysis pubis. When slightly distended, it has a rounded form, and partially fills the pelvic cavity; and when greatly dis- tended, is ovoid in shape, rising into the abdominal cavity, and often extending nearly as high as the umbilicus. It is larger in its vertical diameter than from side to side, and its long axis is directed from above obliquely downwards and backwards, in a line directed from some point between the pubes and umbilicus (according to its distension) to the end of the coccyx. The bladder, when distended, is slightly curved forwards towards the anterior wall of the abdomen, so as to be more convex behind than in front. In the female, it is larger in the transverse than in the vertical diameter, and its capacity is said to be greater

ARTICULATIONS. 178 The Coraco-Clavicular Ligament serves to connect the clavicle Avith the coracoid process of the scapula. It consists of two fasciculi, called the trapezoid and conoid ligaments. The trapezoid ligament, the anterior and external fasciculus, is broad, thin, and quadrilateral: it is placed obliquely between the coracoid process and the clavicle. It is attached, below, to the upper surface of the coracoid process; above, to the oblique line on the under surface of the clavicle. Its anterior border is free; its posterior border is joined with the conoid ligament, the two forming by their junction a projecting angle. The conoid ligament, the posterior and internal fasciculus, is a dense band of fibres, conical in form, the base being turned upwards, the summit downwards. It is attached by its apex to a rough depression at the base of the coracoid process, 131.â€”The Left Shoulder-Joint, Scapulo-CIavicular Articulations and Proper Ligaments of Scapula. internal to the preceding ; above, by its expanded base, to the conoid tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle, and to a line proceeding internally from it for half an inch. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Subclavius ; behind, with the Trapezius: they serve to limit rotation of the scapula forwards and backwards. The Interarticular Fibro-Cartilage is most frequently absent in this articulation. When it exists, it generally only partially separates the articular surfaces, and occupies the upper part of the articulation. More rarely, it completely separates the joint into two cavities.

TRACHEA. 683 found only in front, as high as the middle of the epiglottis. In the rest of its extent, the epithelium is of the squamous variety. Glands. The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with numerous mucipai'ous glands, the orifices of which are found in nearly every part: they are very numerous upon the epiglottis, being lodged in little pits in its substance; they are also found in large numbers along the posterior margin of the aryteno- epiglottidean fold, in front of the arytenoid cartilages, where they are termed the arytenoid glands. They exist also in large numbers upon the inner surface of the sacculus laryngis. None are found on the vocal cords. Vessels and Nerves. The arteries of the larynx are the laryngeal branches derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins empty themselves into the superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins. The lymphatics terminate iu the deep cervical glands. The nerves are the superior laryngeal, and the inferior or recurrent laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric nerves, joined by filaments from 361.â€”Front View of Cartilages of Larynx: the Trachea and Bronchi. the sympathetic. The superior laryngeal nerves supply the mucous membrane of the larynx, and the Crico-thyroid muscles. The inferior laryngeal nerves supply the remaining muscles. The Arytenoid muscle is supplied by both nerves.

Internally it is in rela- tion with the Internal pterygoid.* The Stylo-tnaxillary Ligament is a thin apo- neurotic cord, which ex- tends from near the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone, to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw, between the Masseter and In- ternal pterygoid mus- cles. This ligament separates the parotid from the sub-niaxillary gland, and has attached to its inner side, part of the fibres of origin of the Stylo-glossus muscle. Although usually classed among the ligaments of the jaw, it can only be considered as an accessory in the articulation. * Dr. Humphry describes the internal portion of the capsular ligament separately, as the short internal lateral ligament; and it certainly seems as deserving of a separate description as the external lateral ligament is.

Radial Artket. The Radial artery appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of the brachial, but, in size, it is smaller than the ulnar. It commences at the bifurcation of the brachial, just below the bend of the elbow, and passes along the radial side of the forearm to the wrist; it then winds back- wards, round the outer side of the carpus, beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb, and, running forwards, passes between the two heads of the first Dorsal interos- seous muscle, into the palm of the hand. It then crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar border of the hand, forming the deep palmar arch, and, at its termination, inos- culates with the deep branch of the ulnar artery. The relations of this vessel may thus be conveniently divided into three parts, viz., in front of the forearm, at the back of the wrist, and in the hand. Relations. In the forearm, this vessel extends from op- posite the neck of the radius, to the fore part of the styloid process, being placed to the inner side of the shaft of the J>..^. l.^,.cA rn^r ^^^^^ ^^^^^^ it below. It is superficial throughout its entire extent, being covered by the integu- ment, the superficial and deep fascia, and slightly overlapped above by the Supinator lon- gus. In its course downwards it lies upon the tendon of the Biceps, the Supinator brevis, the Pronator radii teres, the radial origin of the Flexor sublimis digito- rum, the Flexor longus polli- cis, the Pronator quadratus, and the lower extremity of the radius.

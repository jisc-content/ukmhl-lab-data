LUM^BAR PLEXUS. 551 V The mode in wliicli the plexus is formed is the following:—The first lumbar nerve gives off the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves, and a communicating branch to the second lumbar nerve. The second gives off the external cutaneous and genito-crui'al, and a communicating branch to the third nerve.* The third nerve gives a descending filament to the fourth, and divides into two branches, which assist in forming the anterior crural and obturator nerves; sometimes, also, it furnishes a part of the accessory obturator. The fourth nerve completes the formation of the anterior crural, and the obturator, and gives off a communi- cating branch to the fifth lumbar; sometimes it also furnishes part of the accessory obturator. The branches of the lumbar plexus are the Ilio-hypogastric Obturator. Ilio-inguinal. Accessory obturator. Genito-crural, Anterior crural. External cutaneous. These branches may be divided into two groups, according to their mode of distribution. One group, including the ilio-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and part of the genito-crural nerves, supplies the lower part of the parietes of the abdomen; 290.—The Lumbar Plexus and its Branches. the other group, which includes the remaining nerves, supplies the fore part of the thigh and inner side of the leg. The Ilio-hypogastric Nerve {superior musculo-cutaneous) arises from the

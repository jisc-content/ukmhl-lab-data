LYMPHATICS 456 lymphatic vessels from the lips, and are often found enlarged in cases of malignant disease of those parts. The deep lymphatics of the face are derived from the pituitary membrane of the nose, the mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, and the contents of the temporal and orbital fossae; they accompany the branches of the internal maxillary artery, and terminate in the deep parotid and cervical lymphatic glands. The deep lymphatics of the cranium consist of two sets, the meningeal and cerebral. The meningeal lymphatics accompany the meningeal vessels, escape through foramina at the base of the skull, and join the deep cervical lymphatic 248.â€”The Superficial Lymphatics and Glands of the Head, Face, and Neck. glands. The cerebral lymphatics are described by Fohmann as being situated between the arachnoid and pia mater, as well as in the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles; they accompany the trunks of the carotid and vertebral arteries, and probably pass through foramina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cervical glands. They have not at present been demonstrated in the dura mater, or in the substance of the brain. The Lymphatic Glands of the Neck are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial cervical glands are placed in the course of the external jugular vein, between the Platysma and Sterno-mastoid. They are most numerous at the

The Vomer is a single bone, situated vertically at the back part of the nasal fossffi, forming part of the septum of the nose. It is thin, somewhat like a ploughshare in form; but it varies in different individuals, being frequently bent to one or the other side; it presents for examination two surfaces and four borders. The lateral surfaces are smooth, marked with small furrows for the lodgment of blood-vessels, and by a gi'oove on each side, sometimes a canal, the naso-palatine, which runs obliquely downwards and forwards to the intermaxillary suture between the two ante- rior palatine canals; it trans- mits the naso-palatine nerve. The superior border, the thickest, presents a deep groove, bounded on each side by a horizontal projecting ala of bone; the groove receives the rostrum of the sphenoid, whilst the alse are overlapped and retained by laminas (the vaginal processes) which project from the under surface of the body of the sphenoid at the base of the pterygoid processes. At the front of the groove a fissure is left for the transmission of blood-vessels to the substance of the bone. The inferior border, the longest, is broad and uneven

At its commencement is seen a point of medullary sub- stance, corresponding to a subjacent band of white fibres, connecting the anterior and middle lobes, and called the fasciculus unciformis; on following this fissure outwards, it divides into two branches, which enclose a triangular-shaped promi- nent cluster of isolated convolutions, the isla7id of Reil. These convolutions, from being covered in by the sides of the fissure, are called the gyri operti. 265.â€”Base of the Brain. The anterior perforated space is situated at the inner side of the fissure of Sylvius. It is of a triangular shape, bounded in front by the convolution of the anterior lobe and roots of the olfactory nerve; behind, by the optic tract; exter- nally, by the middle lobe and commencement of^he fissure of Sylvius; internally, it is continuous with the lamina cinerea, and crossed by the peduncle of the corpus callosum. It is of a greyish colour, aiid corresponds to the under surface of the corpus striatum, a large mass of grey matter, situated in the interior of the brain; it has received its name from being perforated by numerous minute apertures for the transmission of small straight vessels into the substance of the corpus striatum. The optic commissure is situated in the middle line, immediately behind the lamina cinerea. It is the point of junction between the two optic nerves. Immediately behind the diverging optic tracts, and between them and the peduncles of the cerebrum (crura cerebri) is a lozenge-shaped interval, the inter-

INFERIOR MESENTERIC. 395 Inferior Mesenteric Artery. In order to expose this vessel, draw the small intestines and mesentery over to the right side of the abdomen, raise the transverse colon towards the thorax, and divide the perito- neum covering the left side of the aorta. The Inferior Mesenteric Artery (fig. 226) supplies the descending and sig- moid flexure of the colon, and greater part of the rectum. It is smaller than the superior mesenteric; and arises from the left side of the aorta, between one and two inches above its division into the common iliacs. It passes downwards to the left iliac fossa, and then descends, between the layers of the meso-rectum, into the pelvis, under the name of the superior hcemorrhoidal artery. It lies at first in close relation with the left side of the aorta, and then passes in front of the left common iUac artery. Its branches are the Colica sinistra. Sigmoid. Superior haemorrhoidal. The colica sinistra passes behind the peritoneum, in front of the left kidney, to reach the descending colon, and divides into two branches; an ascending branch, which inosculates with the colica media; and a descending branch, which anasto-

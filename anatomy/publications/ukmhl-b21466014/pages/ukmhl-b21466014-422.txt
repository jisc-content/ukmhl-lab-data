384 ARTERIES. The branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged into the following groups, Anterior ulnar recurrent. Posterior ulnar recurrent. j Anterior interosseous.

The anterior ulnar re- current arises immediately below the elbow-joint,passes upwards and inwards be- tween the Bracliialis anti- cus and Pronator radii teres, supplies these muscles, and, in front of the inner con- dyle, anastomoses with the anastomotica magna and in- ferior jirofunda. The posterior ulnar re- current is much larger, and arises somewhat lower than the preceding. It passes backwards and inwards, be- neath the Flexor sublimis, and ascendsbehind the inner condyle of the humerus. In the interval between this process and the olecranon, it lies beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, ascending be- tween the heads of that muscle, beneath the ulnar nerve; it supplies the neigh-' bouring muscles and joint, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and inter- osseous recurrent arteries. The interosseous artery is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and of con- siderable size, which arises immediately below the tu- berosity of the radius, and, passing backw-ards to the upper border of the inter- osseous membrane, divides into two branches, the an- terior, and posterior inter- osseous. Th.Q anterior interosseous passes down the forearm on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane, 221.â€”Arteries of the Back of the Forearm and Hand.

To the second phalanges, the Flexorjftiblimis digitorum, Extensor communis digitorum; and, in addition, the Extensor irliiicis, to the index finger; the Extensor minimi digiti, to the little finger. To the fciird phalanges, the Flexor profundus digitorum and Extensor communis digitoru*. Development of the Bones op the Hand. The Carpal bones are each developed by a single centre. At birth, they are all cartilaginous. Ossification proceeds in the following order (fig. 96); in the os magnum and unciform an ossific point appears during the first year, the former preceding the latter; in the cuneiform, at the third year; in the trapezium and semilunar, at the fifth year, the former preceding the latter; in the scaphoid, at the sixth year; in the trapezoid, during the eighth year; and in the pisiform, about the twelfth year.

Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the sixth Aveek, and gradually proceeds to either end of the bone; about the third year the digital extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones and

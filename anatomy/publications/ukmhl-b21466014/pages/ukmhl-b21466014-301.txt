ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION. 263 Anterior Thoracic Region. Pectoralis Major. Pectoralis Minor. Subclavius. The Pectoralis Major (fig. l6g) is a broad, thick, triangular muscle, situated at the upper and fore part of the chest, in front of the axilla. It arises from the anterior surface of the sternal half of the clavicle; from half the breadth of the front of the sternum, as low down as the attachment of the cartilage of the 169.â€”Muscles of the Chest and Front of the Arm. Superficial View. sixth or seventh rib; its origin consisting of aponeurotic fibres, which intersect with those of the opposite muscle; it also arises from the cartilages of all the true ribs, with the exception, frequently, of the first, or of the seventh, or both; and from the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle of the abdomen. The fibres from this extensive origin converge towards its insertion, giving to the muscle a radiated appearance. Those fibres which arise from the clavicle, pass obliquely downwards and outwards, and are usually separated from the rest by a cellular interval; those from the lower part of the sternum and the cartilages of the lower true ribs, pass upwards and outwards; whiht the middle fibres pass horizontally.

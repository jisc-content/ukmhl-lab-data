ARTICULATIONS. Actions. The oaly movements permitted in the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension; these movements are more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. The movement of flexion is very considerable, but extension is limited by the anterior and lateral ligaments. ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The articulations of the Lower Extremity comprise the following groups. I. The hip joint. II. The knee joint. III. The articulations between the tibia and fibula. IV. The ancle joint. V. The articulations of the tarsus. VI. The tarso-metatarsal articulations. VII. The metatarso-phalangeal articulations. VIII. The articulations of the phalanges. I. Hip Joint (fig. 138). This articulation is an enarthrodial, or ball-and-socket joint, formed by the reception of the head of the femur into the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabulum. The articulating surfaces are covered with cartilage, that on the head of the femur being thicker at the centre than at the circumference, and covering the entire 138.â€”Left Hip Joint laid open. surface vs^ith the exception of a depression just below its centre for the ligamen- tum teres; that covering the acetabulum is much thinner at the centre than at the circumference, being deficient in the situation of the circular depression at the bottom of this cavity.

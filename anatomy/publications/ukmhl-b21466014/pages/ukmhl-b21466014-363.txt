325 OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. making extension from the knee and ankle, the fragments may be brought into apposition. It is often necessary, however, in compound fracture, to remove a portion of the projecting bone with the saw before complete adaptation can be effected. Fracture of the ^.hula, with displace- io-(.—Fracture of the Fibula, with Displacement onent of the tibia dg. 404), commonly of the Tibia.—'Pott's Fracture.' known as 'Pott , Fracture,' is one of the most freque-xt injuries of the ankle- joint. The end jf the tibia is displaced from the corr iponding surface of the astragalus; the internal lateral ligament is ruptured; and the inner malleolus projects inwards beneath the integu- ment, which is tightly stretched over it, and in danger of bursting. The fibula is broken, usually from two to three inches above the ankle, and occasionally that portion of the tibia with which it is more directly connected below ; the foot is everted by the action of the Peroneus longus, its inner border resting upon the ground, and, at the same time, the heel is drawn up by the muscles of the calf. This injury may be at once reduced by flesing the leg at right angles with the thigh, which relaxes all the opposing muscles, and by making slight exten- sion from the knee and ankle.

It presents a somewhat arched form, from before backwards, terminating anteriorly in a rounded border, which curves downwards and back- wards, between the anterior lobes to the base of the brain. In its course, it forms a distinct bend, named the knee, or genu, and the reflected portion, named the beak {rostrum), becoming gradually narrower, is attached to the anterior cerebral 266.â€”Section of the Brain. Made on a level with the Corpus Callosum. lobe, and is connected, through the lamina cinerea, with the optic commissure. The reflected portion of the corpus callosum gives off", near its tei'mination, two bundles of white substance, which, diverging from one another, pass backwards, across the anterior perforated space, to the entrance of the fissure of Sylvius. They are called the peduncles of the corpus callosum. Posteriorly, the corpus callosum forms a thick, rounded fold, which is free for a little distance, as it curves forwards, and is then continuous with the fornix. On its upper surface, its fibrous structure is very apparent to the naked eye, being collected into coarse, transverse bundles. Along the middle line is a linear depression, tlie raphe, bounded laterally by two or more slightly elevated longitudinal bands, called the stria; longitudinales, or nerves of Lancisi; and, still more externally, other longitudinal striiB are seen, beneath the convolutions which rest on the corpus callosum. These are the strice longitudinales laterales. The under surface of the corpus callosum is continuous behind with the fornix, being separated from it in front by the septum lucidum, which forms a vertical partition between the two ventricles. On either side, the fibres of the corpus callosum penetrate into the substance of the hemispheres, and connect together the anterior, middle, and part of the posterior

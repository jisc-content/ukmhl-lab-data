NERVOUS SYSTEM. 484 The sulci are generally an inch in depth; they also vary in different brains, and in different parts of the same brain; they are usually deepest on the outer convex surface of the hemispheres; the deepest is situated on the inner surface of the hemisphere, on a level with the corpus callosum, and corresponds to the projection in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, the hippocampus minor. The number and extent of the convolutions, as well as their depth, appear to bear a close relation to the intellectual power of the individual, as is shown in their increasing complexity of arrangement as we ascend from the lowest mam- malia up to man. Thus they are absent in some of the lower orders of mammalia, and they increase in number and extent through the higher orders. In man they present the most complex arrangement. Again, in the child at birth before the 264.â€”Upper Surface of the Brain, the Pia Mater having been removed. intellectual faculties are exercised, the convolutions have a very simple arrange- ment, presenting few undulations; and the sulci between them are less deep than in the adult. In old age, when the mental faculties have diminished in activity, the convolutions become much less prominently marked. Those convolutions which are the largest and most constantly present, are the convolution of the corpus callosum, the convolution of the longitudinal fissure, the supra-orbital convolution, and the convolutions of the outer surface of the hemisphere. The convolution of the corpus callosum (gyrus fornicatus) is always well marked. It lies parallel with the upper surface of the corpus callosum, com- mencing, on the under surface of the brain in front of the anterior perforated

277 ANTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION. phalanx of the thumb. The Flexor Long us Polli- cis is situated on the radial side of the fore-arm, lying on the same plane as the prece- ding. It arises from the up- per two-thirds of the grooved anterior surface of the shaft of the radius; commencing, above, immediately below the tuberosity and oblique line, and extending, below, to with- in a short distance of the Pronator quadratus. It also arises from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane, and occasionally by a fleshy slip from the inner side of the base of the coronoid process. The fibres pass downwards and terminate in a flattened tendon, which passes beneath the annular ligament, is then lodged in the in ter-space be- tween the two heads of the Flexor brevis pollicis, and entering a tendino-osseous ca- nal, similar to those for the other flexor tendons, is in- serted into the base of the last Relations. By its anterior surface, with the Flexor sub- limis digitorum, Flexor carpi radialis, Supinator longus, and radial vessels. By its poste- rior surface, with the radius, interosseous membrane, and Pronator quadratus. By its ’ilnar border, with the Flexor profundus digitorum, from which it is separated by the interior interosseous vessels md nerve. The Pronator Quadratus is a small, flat muscle, quadri- ateral in form, extending transversely across the front if the radius and ulna, above heir carpal extremities. It irises from the oblique line m the lower fourth of the interior surface of the shaft if the ulna, and the surface of ione immediately below it ; irom the internal body of the tdna; and from a strong apo- leurosis which covers the 173.—Front of the Left Fore-arm.

392 ARTEKIES. of the intestine, and descends between the layers of the mesentery to the right iliac fossa, where it terminates considerably diminished in size. In its course it forms an arch, the convexity being directed forwards and downwards to the left side, the concavity backwards and upwards to the right. It is accompanied by the superior mesenteric vein, and is surrounded by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. Its branches are the Inferior pancreatico-duodenal. Ileo-colic. Yasa intestini tenuis. Colica dextra. Colica media. The inferior ‘pancreatico-duodenal is given off from the superior mesenteric below the pancreas, and is distributed to the head of the pancreas, and the trans- verse and descending portions of the duodenum; anastomosing with the pancreatico- duodenal artery. 225.—The Superior Mesenteric Artery and its Branches. The vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convex side of the superior mesenteric artery. They are usually from twelve to fifteen in number, and are distributed to the jejunum and ileum. They run parallel with one another between the layers of the mesentery; each vessel dividing into two branches, which unite with a similar branch on each side, forming a series of arches, the convexities of which are directed towards the intestine. From this first set of arches branches arise, which

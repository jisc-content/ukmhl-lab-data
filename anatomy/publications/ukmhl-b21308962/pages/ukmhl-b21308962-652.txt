6l2 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. oris, round the orifice of the mouth. They are rounded in form, about the size of a small pea, their ducts opening by small orifices upon the mucous membrane. In structure, they resemble the other salivary glands. The Cheeks form the sides of the face, and are continuous in front with the lips. They are composed, externally, of integument; internally, of mucous membrane; and, between the two, of a muscular stratum, besides a large quantity of fat, areolar tissue, vessels, nerves, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheek, is reflected above and below upon the gums, and is continuous behind with the lining membrane of the soft palate. Opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw is a papilla, the summit of 319.â€”Sectional View of the Nose, Mouth, Pharynx, etc which presents the minute aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The prin- cipal muscle of the cheek is the Buccinator; but numerous others enter into its | formation; viz., the Zygomatici, Masseter, and the Platysma myoides. The buccal glands are placed between the mucous membrane and Buccinator muscle: they are similar in structure, but smaller, than the labial glands. Two or I three, of larger size than the rest, are placed between the Masseter and Buccinator muscles; their ducts open into the mouth, opposite the last molar tooth. They are| called molar glands. The Gums are composed of a dense fibrous tissue, closely connected to the

626 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. The circular fibres are continuous above with the Inferior constrictor: their direction is transverse at the upper and lower parts of the tube, but oblique in the central part. The muscular fibres in the upper part of the oesophagus are of a red colour, and consist chiefly of the striped variety; but below, they consist entirely of the involuntary muscular fibre. The cellular coat connects loosely the mucous and muscular coats. The mucous coat is thick, of a reddish colour above, and pale below. It is loosely connected with the muscular coat, and disposed in longitudinal plicae, which disappear on distension of the tube. Its surface is studded with minute papillae, and it is covered throughout with a thick layer of squamous epithelium. The oesophageal glands are numerous small compound glands, scattered throughout the tube: they are lodged in the submucous tissue, and open upon the surface by a long excretory duct. They are most numerous at the lower part of the tube, where they form a ring round the cardiac orifice. The Abdomen. The abdomen is the largest cavity of the trunk of the body, and is separated, below, from the pelvic cavity by the brim of the pelvis. It is of an oval form, 331.â€”The Regions of the Abdomen and their Contents. (Edge of Costal Cartilages in dotted outline.) the extremities of the oval being directed upwards and downwards; it is wider above than below, and measures more in the vertical than in the transverse diameter. Boundaries. It is bounded, in front and at the sides, by the lower ribs, the Transversales muscles, and venter ilii; behind, by the vertebral column, and the Psoae and Quadrati lumborum muscles ; above, by the Diaphragm; beloic, by the

258 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE. the Diaphragm, and the lower or lesser muscle. It arises from the whole of the internal circumference of the thorax, being attached, in front, by fleshy fibres to the ensiform cartilage; on each side, to the inner surface of the cartilages and bony portions of the six or seven inferior ribs, interdigitating with the Trans- versalis; and behind, to two aponeurotic arches, named the ligamentum arcuatum externum and internum; and to the lumbar vertebrae. The fibres from these sources vary in length; those arising from the ensiform appendix are very short and occasionally aponeurotic; but those from the ligamenta arcuata, and more especially those from the ribs at the side of the chest, are the longest, describe well marked curves as they ascend, and finally converge, to be inserted into the circumference of the central tendon. Between the sides of th&*inuscular slip from the ensiform appendix and the cartilages of the adjoining Tibs, the fibres 167.â€”The Diaphragm. Under Surface. 0/,cv>n3 of the Diaphragm are deficient, the interval being filled by areolar tissue, covered on the thoracic side by the pleurae; on the abdominal, by the peritoneum. This is, consequently, a weak point, and a portion of the contents of the abdomen may protrude into the chest, forming phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia, or a collection of pus in the mediastinum may descend through it, so as to point at the epigastrium. The ligamentum arcuatum internum is a tendinous arch, thrown across the upper part of the Psoas magnus muscle, on each side of the spine. It is connected, by one end, to the outer side of the body of the first, and occasionally the second lumbar vertebra, being continuous with the outer side of the tendon of the cor- responding crus; and, by the other end, to the front of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra.

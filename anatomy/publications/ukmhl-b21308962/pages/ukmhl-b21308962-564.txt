524 CRANIAL NERVES. The superior, or jugular ganglion, is situated in the upper part of the groove in which the nerve is lodged during its passage through the jugular foramen. It is of very small size, and involves only the outer side of the trunk of the nerve, -Course and Distribution of the Eighth Pair “ fascicul“s PasainS of Nerves. 284.- beyond it, which is not connected directly with it. The inferior, or petrous ganglion, is situated in a depression in the lower border of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone; it is larger than the for- mer, and involves the whole of the fibres of the nerve. From this ganglion .arise those filaments which con- nect the glosso-pharyngeal with other nerves at the base of the skull. Its branches o f commu- nication are with the pneu- mogastric, sympathetic, and facial, and the tym- panic branch. The branches to the pneumogastric, are two fila- ments, one to its auricular branch, and one to the up- per ganglion of the pneu- mogastric. The branch to the sym- pathetic is connected with the superior cervical gang- lion. The branch of commu- nication with the facial, perforates the posterior belly of the Digastric. It arises from the trunk of the nerve below the petrous ganglion, and joins the fa- cial just after its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. The tympanic branch (Jacobson’s nerve), arises from the petrous ganglion, and enters a small bony canal on the base of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone. (This opening is placed on the bony ridge which separates the ca- rotid canal from the jugular fossa.) It ascends to the tympanum, enters this cavity by an aperture in its floor close to the inner wall, and divides into three branches, which are contained in grooves upon the surface of the promontory.

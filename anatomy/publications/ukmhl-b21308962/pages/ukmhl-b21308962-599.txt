559 CUTANEOUS NERVES OF FOOT. like the posterior interosseous nerve at the wrist, supplies the Extensor brevis digitorum and the articulations of the tarsus and metatarsus. The internal branch, the continuation of the nerve, accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery along the inner side of the dorsum of the foot, and, at the first inter- osseous space, divides into tAvo branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toes, communicating Avith the internal division of the musculo- cutaneous nerve. The Musculo- Cutaneous Branch supplies the muscles on the fibular side of the leg, and the integument of the dorsum of the foot. It passes forwards between the Peronei muscles and the Extensor longus digitorum, pierces the deep fascia at the lower third of the leg, on its front and outer side, and divides into tAvo branches. This nerve, in its course between the muscles, gives off muscular branches to the Peroneus longus and brevis, and cutaneous filaments to the integument of the lower part of the leg. The internal branch of the museulo-cutaneous nerve, passes in front of the ankle-joint, and along the dorsum of the foot, it supplies the inner side of the great toe, and the adjoining sides of the second and third toes. It also supplies the integument of the inner ankle and inner side of the foot, communicating with the internal saphenous nerve, and joins with the anterior tibial nerve, between the great and second toes. The external branch, the larger, passes along the outer side of the dorsum of the foot, to be distributed to the adjoining sides of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. It also supplies the integument of the outer ankle and outer side of the foot, communicating Avith the short saphenous nerve. The distribution of these nerves will be found to vary; together, they supply all the toes excepting the outer side of the little toe, and the adjoining sides of the great and second toes.

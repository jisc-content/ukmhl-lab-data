394 ARTERIES. of this tube, the rectum should never be divided beyond this point in that direction, 1 for fear of involving this artery. The Supra-Renal Arteries are two small vessels which arise, one on each I: side of the aorta, opposite the superior mesenteric artery. They pass obliquely upwards and outwards, to the under surface of the supra-renal capsules, to which | they are distributed, anastomosing with capsular branches from the phrenic and ,| renal arteries. In the adult these arteries are of small size; in the foetus they are as large as the renal arteries. 1 The Renal Arteries are two large trunks, which arise from the sides of the I aorta, immediately below the superior mesenteric artery. Each is directed out- wards, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The right one longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta, passes behind the inferior I of the sacrum it divides into two branches, which descend one on each side of the rectum, where they divide into several small branches, which are distributed between the mucous and muscular coats of that tube, to near its lower end; ana- stomosing with each other, with the middle haemorrhoidal arteries, branches of the internal iliac, and with the inferior haemorrhoidal, branches of the internal pudic. The student should especially remark, that the trunk of the vessel descends along the back part of the rectum as far as the middle of the sacrum before it j divides; this is about a finger’s length or four inches from the anus.

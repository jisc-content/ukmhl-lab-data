294 MUSCLES AND FASOL/E. Remove this fascia, and the muscles of the iliac region will be exposed. The Psoas Magnus (fig. 187) is a long fusiform muscle, placed on the side of the lumbar region of the spine and margin of the pelvis. It arises from the sides of the bodies, from the corresponding inter-vertebral substances, and from the front of the bases of the transverse processes of the last dorsal and all the lumbar ver- tebra?. The muscle is connected to the bodies of the vertebra? by five slips; each slip is attached to the upper and lower margins of two vertebrae, and to the inter- vertebral substance between them; the slips themselves being connected by tendinous arches extending across the constricted part of the bodies, beneath which pass the lumbar arteries and sympathetic nervous filaments. These tendinous arches also give origin to muscular fibres and protect the blood-vessels and nerves from pressure during the action of the muscle. The first slip is attached to the con- tiguous margins of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebras; the last, to the contiguous margins of the fourth and fifth lumbar, and inter-vertebral substance. From these points, the muscle passes down across the brim of the pelvis, and diminishing gradually in size, passes beneath Poupartâ€™s ligament, and terminates in a tendon, which, after receiving the fibres of the Iliacus, is inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur. Relations. In the lumbar region. By its anterior surface, which is placed behind the peritoneum, with the ligamentum arcuatum internum, the kidney, Psoas parvus, renal vessels, ureter, spermatic vessels, genito-crural nerve, the colon, and along its pelvic border, with the common and external iliac artery and vein. By its posterior surface, with the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra? and the Quadratus lumborum, from which it is separated by the anterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the Transversalis; the anterior crural nerve is at first situated in the substance of the muscle, and emerges from its outer border at its lower part. The lumbar plexus is situated in the posterior part of the substance of the muscle. By its inner side, with the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, the lumbar arteries, the sympathetic ganglia, and its communicating branches with the spinal nerves; the lumbar glands, with the vena cava on the right, and the aorta on the left side. In the thigh it is in relation, in front, with the fascia lata; behind, with the capsular ligament of the hip, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, which some- times communicates with the cavity of the joint through an opening of variable size. By its inner border, with the Pectineus and the femoral artery, which slightly overlaps it. By its outer border, with the crural nerve and Iliacus muscle. The Psoas Parvus is a long slender muscle, placed in front of the preceding. It arises from the sides of the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra?, and from the inter-vertebral substance between them. It forms a small flat muscular bundle, which terminates in a long, flat tendon, which is inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence, being continuous, by its outer border, with the iliac fascia. This muscle is present, according to M. Theile, in one out of every twenty subjects examined. Relations. It is covered by the peritoneum, and at its origin by the ligamentum arcuatum internum; it rests on the Psoas magnus. The Iliacus is a flat radiated muscle, which fills up the whole of the internal iliac fossa. It arises from the iliac fossa, and inner margin of the crest of the ilium; behind, from the ilio-lumbar ligament, and base of the sacrum; in front, from the anterior superior and anterior inferior spinous processes of the ilium, the notch between them, and by a few fibres from the capsule of the hip-joint. The fibres converge to be inserted into the outer side of the tendon of the Psoas, some of them being prolonged into the oblique line which extends from the lesser tro- chanter to the linea aspera. Relations. Within the pelvis: by its anterior surface, with the iliac fascia, which separates the muscle from the peritoneum, and with the external cutaneous nerve; on the right side, with the caecum; on the left side, with the sigmoid flexure of the colon. By its posterior surface, with the iliac fossa. By its inner border, with the Psoas magnus, and anterior crural nerve. In the thigh, it is in

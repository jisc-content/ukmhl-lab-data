The Extensor Carpi Ra- dialis Brevior is shorter, as its name implies, and thicker than the preceding muscle, beneath which it is placed. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus by a tendon common to it and the three following muscles; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint; from a strong aponeurosis which covers its surface; and from the inter- muscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. The fibres terminate about the middle of the fore-arm in a flat tendon, which is closely connected with that of the preceding muscle, accompanies it to the wrist, lying in the same groove on the posterior surface of the radius; passes beneath the annular ligament, and, diverging somewhat from its fellow, is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, its radial side. The tendons of the two pro-' ceding muscles pass through the same compartment of the annular ligament, are lubri- cated by a single synovial membrane, but separated from each other by a small vertical ridge of bone, as they lie in the groove at the back ot the radius. Relations. By its super- ficial surface, with the Ex- tensor carpi radialis longior, and crossed by the Extensor muscles of the thumb. By its deep surface, with the Supinator brevis, tendon of the Pronator radii teres, radius, and wrist-joint. By its ulnar border, with the Extensor communis digito- -Posterior Surface of Fore-arm.

ARTERIES. 39° The Hepatic Artery in the adult is intermediate in size between the gastric and splenic; in the foetus, it is the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis. It passes upwards to the right side, between the layers of the lesser omentum, and in front of the foramen of Winslow, to the transverse fissure of the liver, Avliere it divides into two branches (right and left), which supply the cor- responding lobes of that organ, accompanying the ramifications of the vena portae and hepatic duct. The hepatic artery, in its course along the right border of the lesser omentum, is in relation with the ductus communis choledocus and portal vein, the former lying to the right of the artery, and the vena portae behind. Its branches are the Pyloric. Grastro-duodenalis Cystic. Gastro-epiploica dextra. Pancreatico-duodenalis. 224.— The Coeliac Axis and its Branches, the Stomach having been raised, and the Transverse Meso-Colon removed. life nt The pyloric branch arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to the pyloric end of the stomach; and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, supplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric artery. The gastro-duodenalis is a short but large branch, which descends behind the duodenum, near the pylorus, and divides at the lower border of the stomach I into two branches, the gastro-epiploica deiftra and the pancreatico-duodenalis. | c I t i l 1 1 1

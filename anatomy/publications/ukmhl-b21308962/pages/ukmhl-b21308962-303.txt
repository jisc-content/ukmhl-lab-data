265 ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION. surface is separated from the Pectoralis major by a strong aponeurosis, which Avith the clavicle, forms an osteo-librous sheath in which the muscle is enclosed. If the costal attachment of the Pectoralis minor is divided across, and the muscle reflected outwards, the axillary vessels and nerves are brought fully into view, and should be examined. Nerves. The Pectoral muscles are supplied by the anterior thoracic nerves; the Subclavius, by a filament from the cord formed by the union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. Actions.

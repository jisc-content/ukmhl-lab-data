ISCHIO-RECTAL FOSSA; PERINEUM. 745 •• I ligament. This space is filled with a largfe mass of adipose substance, which I explains the frequency with which abscesses in the neighbourhood of the rectum burrow to a considerable depth. If the subject has been injected, on placing the finger on the outer wall of this fossa, the internal pudic artery, witff its accompanying veins and nerve, will be felt about an inch and a half above the margin of tire ischial tuberosity, but approaching nearer the surface as they pass forwards along the inner margin of the pubic arch. These structures are enclosed in a sheath formed by the obturator fascia, the pudic nerve lying below the artery. Crossing the space transversely, about its centre, are the inferior haemorrhoid^ Vessels and nerves, branches of the pudic; they are distributed to the integunjent bf*ftlie anus, and to the muscles of the lower end of the rectum. These vessel's are occasionally of large size, and may give rise to troublesome haemori’hage, when divided in the operation of litho- tomy, or for fistula in ano. At the back part of this space may be seen a branch of the fourth sacral nerve; and, at the fore part of the space, a cutaneous branch of the perinaeal nerve. PeRINjEUM. The perineeal space is of a triangular form; its deep boundaries are limited, laterally, by the rami of the pubes and ischia, meeting in front at the pubic arch; behind,'by an imaginary transverse line, extending between the tuberosity of the ischium on either side. The lateral boundaries vary, in the adult, from three inches to three inches and a half in length ; and the base from two to three inches and a half in breadth; the average diameter being two inches and three-quarters. The variations in the diameter of this space are of extreme interest in connection with the operation of lithotomy, and the extraction of a stone from the cavity of the bladder. In those cases where the tuberosities of the ischia are approximated, it would be necessary to make the incisions in the lateral operation of lithotomy much less oblique, than if the tuberosities were widely separated, and the per in am] space, consequently, wider. The perinseum is subdivided by the median raphe into two equal parts. Of these, the left is the one usually selected to commence the primary incisions in the operation of lithotomy. In the middle line, the perinasum is convex, and corresponds to the bulb of the urethra. The skin covering it is of a dark colour, thin, freely moveable upon the subjacent parts, and covered with sharp crisp hairs, which should be removed before the dissection of the part is commenced. In front of the anus, a prominent line commences, the raphe, continuous in front with the raphe of the scrotum. The flaps of integument corresponding to this space having been removed, in the manner shown in fig. 388—1, the superficial fascia is exposed. The Superficial Fascia consists of two layers, as in other regions of the body, superficial and deep. The superficial layer is thick, loose, areolar in texture, and contains much adipose tissue in its meshes, the amount of which varies in different subjects. In front, it is continuous with the dartos of the scrotum; behind, it is continuous with the subcutaneous areolar tissue surrounding the anus; and, on either side, with the same fascia on the inner side of the thighs. This layer should be carefully removed, after it has been examined, when the deep layer will be exposed. The deep layer of superficial fascia (superficial peri meal fascia) is thin, aponeurotic in structure, and of considerable strength, serving to bind down the muscles of the root of the penis. It is continuous, in front, with the dartos of the scrotum; on either side, it is firmly attached to the margins of the rami of the pubes and ischium, external to the crus penis, and as far back as the tuberosity of the ischium; posteriorly, it curves down behind the Transversus perimei muscles to join the lower margin of the deep perinaeal fascia. This fascia not only covers the muscles in this region, but sends down a vertical septum from its under surface

628 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. I The Peritoneum. The peritoneum (grepiTeiveLV, to extend around) is a serous membrane; and, ' like all membranes of this class, a shut sac. In the female, however, it is not completely closed, the Fallopian tubes communicating with it by their free extremities; and thus the serous membrane is continuous with their mucous lining. O . The peritoneum partially invests all the viscera contained in the abdominal and pelvic cavities, forming the visceral layer of the membrane; it is then reflected upon the internal surface of the parietes of those cavities, forming the parietal layer^ The free surface of the peritoneum is smooth, moist, and covered by a thin, squamous epithelium; its attached surface is rough, being connected to the viscera and inner surface of the parietes by means of areolar tissue, called the sub-'peritoneal areolar tissue. The parietal portion is loosely connected with the fascia lining the abdomen and pelvis; but more closely to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and in the middle lin6 of the abdomen. In order to trace the reflections of this membrane (fig. 332) (the abdomen 332.—The Reflections of the Peritoneum, as seen in a vertical Section of the Abdomen. 01 an su an w] an or; thi th( 9 iti ¥ of sm livi of' si A Wi ■ Aii having been opened), the liver should be raised and supported in that position, and the stomach should be depressed, when a thin membranous layer is seen passing from the transverse fissure of the liver, to the upper border of the stomach: this is the lesser, or gastro-hepatic omentum. It consists of two thin, delicate layers of peritoneum, an anterior and a posterior, between which are

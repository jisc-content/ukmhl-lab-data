Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. 1. DISEASES OF THE NOSE. Hemorrhages from the nasal mucosa occur fre- quently in connection with ulcerative and other in- flammations, as a result of injuries, neoplasms, the hemorrhagic diathesis, and infections diseases (ty- phoid fever, influenza). Inflammatory processes of all sorts are often ob- served upon the nasal mucosa, more frequently in children than in adults; acute, subacute, and chronic catarrhs with chiefly sero-mucous or purulent secre- tion. Acute infectious catarrhs in particular have a tendency to extend downward into the pharynx, lar- ynx, trachea, and bronchi. Secondary forms of nasal suppuration are some- times observed in connection with purulent inflam- mation of the accessory cavities or with caries of the cribriform bones. Among the serious forms of rhinitis are erysipela- tous and phlegmonous inflammations of the mucous membrane; they develop from erosions and ulcera- tions and extend by preference to the cutis and sub- cutis of the face and head. Ozaena (rhinitis atrophicans foetida) is character- ized by a secretion which rapidly dries into crusts and furnishes a good culture medium for microbes, especially those of decomposition (mixed infection);

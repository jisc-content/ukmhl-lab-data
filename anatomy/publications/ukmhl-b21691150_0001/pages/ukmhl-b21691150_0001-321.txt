(2) Traction diverticula, whose frequency is greater than that of the former, are more funnel shaped, are usually situated at the anterior wrall of the oesophagus near the root of the lung, and result from traction from without, exerted by lymphatic glands which have been inflamed and gradually become sclerosed and shrunken, thus dragging on the adjoining wall of the gullet and producing dilatations and diverticula. Owing to the accumulation of food at the bottom of the latter, inflammatory processes are sometimes set up and cause perforation and sloughing in the sur- rounding structures (mediastinitis, pleurisy, and pul- monary gangrene). Carcinoma of the oesophagus (Plate 35) is more frequently primary than secondary. It begins as an insular process and has a tendency to spread as a ring or belt until it finally infiltrates the wall for a distance of 5 cm. and more. Ulcerative disintegration sets in early and is ultimately followed by perforation into the surrounding organsâ€”trachea, bronchi, lung (inhalation pneumonia), pleura, large arterial branches, or the mediastinum. Cancer of the oesophagus is located chiefly in the middle and lower third and attacks men more often than women (5:1). The secondary stenosis may again disappear in the later stages, owing to the progressive destruc- tion. Cancer of the oesophagus develops now and then secondarily by contiguity from the cardia, the pharynx, or the thyroid gland.

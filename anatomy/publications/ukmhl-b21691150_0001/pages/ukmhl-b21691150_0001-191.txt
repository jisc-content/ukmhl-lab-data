Explanation of Plate 59. Syphilis of the Liveh in the New-born. Compared with the development of the body the liver appears enlarged; weight, 144 gm. = 5 oz.; consistence very firm. On section we observe, surrounded by a light yellow, partly sulphur-colored and icteric paren- chyma, a syphiloma the size of a large plum, having an irregularly oblong form, prolongations of which extend through all the lobes; it is of a firm, almost board-like consistence, of a yellowish-gray color, with irregular jagged borders which are somewhat overhanging; in part it is gelatinous and sprinkled with grayish-yellow mili- ary nodules. Associated conditions found were general icterus, great swelling of the spleen to three times its size, congenital syphilis.

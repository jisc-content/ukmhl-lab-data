Under the same head belongs follicular dysentery, which is characterized by multiple ulcers springing from the solitary follicles of the colon. Neoplasms of the Intestine. The most frequent new formation is cancer, whose point of predilection is the rectum (more than sixty per cent of all intestinal cancers); in thirty per cent the colon and ciecum are involved, the remaining four to seven per cent occur in the small intestine. Can- cer of the bowel is most commonly met with between the fiftieth and sixtieth years of life. Secondary cancer of the intestine occurs now and then, the primary neoplasm being in the pancreas or the stomach. Anatomically the same forms are found in the in- testine as in the stomach. Hard cancer (scirrhus) forms circumscribed nodules or a firm annular infil- tration. A more frequent variety is medullary car- cinoma which is characterized by its tendency to ulceration; now and then it takes the form of a papil- lary or villous tumor which develops from a polypoid adenoma. The least common is colloid cancer, which is met with mainly in the rectum. In the lowest portion of the rectum near the anus epithelioma is sometimes found. â€¢ As in the stomach, after the mucous membrane the submucosa, muscular tunic, and serous coat are early invaded; stenosis of the intestine occurs almost in-

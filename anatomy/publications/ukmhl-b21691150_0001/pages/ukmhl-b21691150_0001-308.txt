ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 174 losis we find almost regularly the typical picture of a recurrent pleurisyâ€”at the apex of the lung and over the upper lobe an old adhesive, frequently membra- nous pleurisy; over the middle and lower portions of the lung, recent exudative sero-fibrinous or purulent pleurisy in all possible gradations as regards the extent and intensity of the process. Neoplasms of the pleura are found most frequently in the form of multiple secondary metastatic cancer- ous nodules (Plate 32), which are often attached to the surface like drops of wax, or else in the form of sarco- matous nodules. Now and then we may observe dif- fuse carcinomatous infiltration (lymphangitis carcino- matosa) in a reticulated arrangement (Plate 32) or membranous diffuse proliferation with obliteration of the pleural cavities. DISEASES OF THE MEDIASTINUM. In the loose connective tissue of the mediastinum inflammatory processes are sometimes met with, usu- ally resulting from extension of analogous processes in neighboring organs such as the pleurae, the lungs, the pericardium, the sternum, the spinal column, and the oesophagus. When the connective-tissue invest- ment of the parietal pericardium is the seat of inflam- mation the condition is known as external pericarditis or mediastino-pericarditis. More rarely we may dis- cover limited inflammations in the form of abscesses, for instance, in the anterior mediastinum by exten- sion of an inflammation from the cervical connective tissue or in caries of the sternum, in the posterior mediastinum by purulent liquefaction of lymphatic

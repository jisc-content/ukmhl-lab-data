ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 146 2. Clialicosis, stone lung (Plate 25, Fig. c), is found in workmen laboring in an atmosphere charged with stone dust, especially in stone-cutters, millstone- dressers, glass and diamond cutters. To the same class belongs in the main also the inhalation of street dust. The mineral dust composed chiefly of silicates and limestone grit irritates the mucous membrane of the respiratory canal and the pulmonary tissue far more than do soot and coal dust. In advanced cases fibrous peribronchitis and perivasculitis, now and then also chronic broncho-pneumonia, result. When the injurious influence has been more prolonged and more intense, especially if caused by inhaled irregu- larly angular and pointed particles of quartz, a dif- fuse disease of the pulmonary tissue, indurative clialicosis, may develop. In pronounced cases we find the pleura as a rule as rough as a grater, owing to the numerous subpleural deposits of fibrous nod- ules, about the size of a liempseed, which can also be felt and seen on the cut surface. 3. Siderosis, metal-dust lung, exists in several vari- etiesâ€”the red-iron lung (Plate 25, Fig. a), when the red oxide of iron, such as is used in coloring blotting- paper, is inhaled in large amounts for a considerable length of time; the black-iron lung, when the ferroso- ferric oxide is inhaled. At first we find, as in chali- cosis, small grayish translucent nodules, later firm fibrous nodules and tubercles which tend to coalesce and resemble in appearance the sole of a shoe closely studded with nails. Finally, in the advanced stages, a diffuse cirrhosis results, which is especially char- acteristic by its intense rust-colored markings after the inhalation of red oxide of iron.

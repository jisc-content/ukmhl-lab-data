DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 121 owing to their great increase fetor results and the mucous membrane atrophies in consequence of con- nective-tissue contraction. The process is observed chiefly in scrofulous and dyscrasic, more rarely in healthy subjects; occasionally it spreads to the naso- pharynx and the accessory cavities of the nose. Tuberculosis of the nasal mucosa is rare in its ulcerative form; it is secondary and differs in no way from tuberculous affections of other mucous mem- branes. The ulcers are usually irregularly round and have an eroded bottom; a rarefying osteitis of the adjoining bones, together with necrosis and the- development of the micro-organisms of decomposition may be superadded. Diphtheria of the nasal mucosa is observed at times secondarily in diphtheria of the pharynx; this disease is localized pre-eminently in the nasopharynx, the anterior half of the nose being in a condition of puru- lent inflammation, which involves also the maxillary cavities and the cells of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Owing to the associated enlargement of the pharyngeal tonsil, the swelling and exudation often cause considerable stenosis and occlusion of the nasal canal. In some infectious diseases (scarlatina, measles, and typhoid fever) there may be a similar affection as in the pharynx and larynx, in the shape of a necrosing (diphtheroid) rhinitis, which probably is invariably due to infection with streptococci. In syphilitic ozaena we observe, along with catar- rhal inflammation of the mucosa, ulcerative and de- structive processes which spring from the originally cellular and gummous infiltration of the mucous mem- brane, of the perichondrium, or of the periosteum.

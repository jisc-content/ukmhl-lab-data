Explanation of Plates 10 and 11. Aneurism of the Thoracic Aorta, the Size of a Fist. (Involving the Arch of the Aorta, with the Adjoining Portions of the Ascending and Descending Aorta.) In the anterior mediastinum, above the pericardium, was a tumid mass, having a fluctuating feel, its circum- ference the size of the palm of, a hand. After removal of the thoracic organs the arch of the aorta with the ad- joining portions of the vessel, beginning about 8 cm. = 34 in. above the aortic valves, was found to be considerably dilated to the size of a small childâ€™s head. The intima of the dilated portion is irregularly tubercular; some parts of the sac wall are greatly thinned, less resistant, and covered with layers of rather firm, whitish-yellow masses of fibrin. The adjoining undilated parts of the aorta show a moderate degree of sclerosis, i. e., irregular ridge-like thickening, spots of opacity, and slight calcifi- cation. The aortic aneurism has extended partly upward and to the left; the upper dorsal spinal column is somewhat eroded on the left side; the principal bronchus of the left lung is much compressed and narrowed (broncho- stenosis) by the aortic dilatation. The patient, aged fifty-three years (No. 648, 1894), was greatly emaciated; her heart was remarkably small and the thyroid gland enlarged (colloid struma). Dura- tion of the disease about eighteen months; grave symp- toms had been present for the past year. The diagnosis rested for some time between mediastinal tumor and aneurism. The etiology is quite unknown; as the pa- tient was well-to-do (the wife of a merchant), physical overstrain and alcoholism could be absolutely excluded. 11

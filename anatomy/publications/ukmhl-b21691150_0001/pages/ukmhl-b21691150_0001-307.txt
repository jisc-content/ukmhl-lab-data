DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 173 tuberculosis or with infectious croupous pneumonia. In purulent pleurisy we find besides the pyogenic fungi (usually streptococci) frequently pneumococci and exceptionally tubercle bacilli. In long-standing empyema the micro-organisms may be absent because they have perished; in other cases (tuberculosis) the microparasites are so sparse that they can be demon- strated only by animal experiments. Tuberculous pleurisy (Plate 31) should be clearly differentiated from sero-fibrinous, purulent, or adhe- sive pleurisy which is found secondarily in all pos- sible complications with pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculous pleurisy, which usually runs an acute or a subacute course, is characterized by the eruption of numerous, often barely visible miliary tubercles scattered over the opacified, more or less thickened, at times somewhat fibrous pleura; the exudate is sero- fibrinous, more often hemorrhagic or purulent (mixed infection by accidental pyogenic organisms). When of long standing with a subacute course we find yel- lowish cheesy nodules and foci distributed through the more markedly thickened, grayish-white pleural membrane. The view which was largely entertained, that when a pleurisy runs an unfavorable course (in- spissation and caseation of the exudate with its defec- tive absorption) tuberculosis is very liable to develop secondarily both in the pleura and in the lung, is to be modified, according to the present state of our knowledge, to the effect that the majority of cases of apparently spontaneous pleurisy are either directly of tuberculous origin or arise indirectly in connection with latent and localized pulmonary tuberculosis. In the terminal stage of fatal pulmonary tubercu-

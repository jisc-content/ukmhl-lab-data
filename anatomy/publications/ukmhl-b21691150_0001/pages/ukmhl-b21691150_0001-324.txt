ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 190 dition exists at the same time in the intestinal canal, i.e., chronic congestive gastro-intestinal catarrh. In other cases the surface of the thickened mucous membrane is covered with flat elevations and low verrucose protuberances (etat mamelonne). In this hyperplastic and sclerosing form of gastritis liyper- trophicans prolifera we may find, when the disease has reached an advanced stage, true warty elevations (gastritis verrucosa), or even larger polypoid prolifer- ations (gastritis polyposa, Plate 37). As a result of oft-repeated hyperaemic conditions with their associated hemorrhage by diapedesis we may sometimes find a diffuse or partial pigmentation of the mucous membrane, which is of a lead gray or slaty gray color, and again most markedly so in the region of the pylorus. On microscopic examination the mucous membrane is seen to be sprinkled with numerous granules of melanin — gastritis chronica pigmentosa. As a sequel of chronic gastritis there is developed, though rarely, a connective-tissue hypertrophy of all the coats of the stomach associated with shrinking of the organ (benign sclerosis of the stomach)—a con- dition which is very similar to diffuse infiltrated gas- tric cancer. In doubtful cases the state of the lym- phatic glands and the microscopic examination will settle the diagnosis. The stomach is contracted to the diameter of the intestine and the walls may reach the thickness of the little finger and are hypertrophic. Croupous, diphtheritic, and phlegmonous inflam- mations of the stomach are very rare and the same remark applies to ulcerative tuberculous gastritis (Plate 38).

Explanation of Plate 44. Necrotic and Ulcerating Septic Colitis. Sporadic Dysentery. The mucous membrane over the entire extent of the colon is greatly injected, oedematous, with superficial necrotic spots here and there. At various points are circumscribed, roundish, ulcerated defects, extending in some instances as far as the serosa, and having a yellow- ish discolored, soft, and friable bottom; there are also multiple hemorrhagic foci of the mucosa. The patient, a woman aged seventy years, was insane and marasmic. The cause of death was a terminal pleuropneumonia of the left lower lobe. She had been bedridden for months and had long suffered from obsti- nate constipation. In the last weeks before death pro- fuse diarrhoeas and symptoms of an intense chronic catarrh of the colon set in. As a large bedsore in the sacral region was present between three and four weeks before death, it is probable that the grave intestinal affection was of septic origin (No. 165, 1894). (The case is described at greater length in the dis- sertation by Maximo Asenjo: “ Zur Kenntniss der spora- disclien Dysenterie, ” Munich, 1894.) 44

Explanation of Plate 46. Typhoid Fever. (End of the second week.) In the greatly injected and swollen mucosa of the lower ileum above the valve of Bauhin is a considerable number of ulcers covered with firm crusts showing a dirty- greenish discoloration. Two larger oval ulcers with markedly tumid margins are situated immediately above the valve. In the neighborhood are several cup-shaped ulcers, ranging in size from a lentil to a pea, which are likewise covered with crusts. While the larger ulcers correspond to Beyer’s patches, the smaller spring from the solitary follicles which are swollen to the size of a pea; some of these, in the stage of medullary swelling and infiltration (lymphoid, inflammatory hyperplasia), are clearly differentiated from the injected and swollen mucosa in the lower portion of the illustration. In the adjoining caecum the mucosa resembles that of the ileum; it is markedly swollen, injected, and shows an enlarged solitary follicle and toward the left a small ulcer covered with a crust. The autopsy of the patient, a woman aged twenty- seven years (No. 619, 1895), revealed medullary swell- ing of the mesenteric glands, enlargement of the spleen (weight, 410 gm. = 14£ oz.), and a hemorrhagic lobu- lar pneumonia of the right lower lobe. 46

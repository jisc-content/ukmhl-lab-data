ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 228 are light gray or pale yellowish. This alternation of dark spots and light reticulated tints produces a very characteristic mottling of the cut surface (nut- meg liver), which, according to the amount of blood and the associated or absent fatty infiltration of the marginal zones of the acini, shows various gradations â€”dark and light (anaemic) shades of nutmeg liver. When the circulatory disturbance is of long standing the entire organ appears shrunken (atrophic nutmeg liver, cyanotic or red atrophy). Atrophy of the Liver. Partial atrophy of the liver is frequently found in the so-called corset liver, in which the furrow, vary- ing in width and depth, runs transversely across the antero-inferior portions of the right and sometimes also of the left lobe. Simple diffuse atrophy occurs in very old, cachec- tic, or greatly emaciated patients; the bulk of the liver may sink to half of the normal; the tissue is firm and of a dull brown color (brown atrophy); a finely granular pigment is found deposited in the centre of the acini. Acute yellow atrophy of the liver (Plate 54), so called, belongs to the group of degenerative and necrotic processes and will be discussed with degen- eration of the liver. Hypertrophy of the Liver. Partial vicarious hypertrophy (regeneration) of isolated segments is found sometimes after the loss of portions of the liver, in a specially characteristic

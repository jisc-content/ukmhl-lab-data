The capillaries are markedly tortuous, resembling varices, and project deeply into the alve- oli ; at the same time there are a condensation of the pulmonary framework and widening of the septa. The increased capillary pressure causes continual dia- pedesis of red blood corpuscles, which change into granular and liquid hsematoidin. The latter is de- posited in the pulmonary stroma and particularly in the alveolar epitlielia and leucocytes. The latter are sometimes called heart-lesion cells, because their oc- currence in the septa indicates lesions of the heart and pulmonary congestion of cardiac origin. Owing to the enormous accumulation of the rusty brown coloring matter in the pulmonary parenchyma and the associated fibrillary hyperplasia of the stroma of the lung, alterations develop which are known as “brown induration.” In the higher grades of the condition the lung is of a rusty color, in the initial stages more reddish-brown, and of a firm consistence; as a rule the bronchi are in a state of chronic catarrh (congestive catarrh). Another form of venous hypersemia is the hypo- static variety which is often met with in the posterior and inferior segments of the lung in cases of cardiac weakness, of prolonged agony, and of permanent dor- sal position of the patients. In this vital hypostasis the affected portions of the lung appear overfilled with blood, of a dark brownish-red color, water- logged, and the contained air is correspondingly di- minished; the passage of the blood into the air spaces of the lung and thence into the bronchi is often ob-

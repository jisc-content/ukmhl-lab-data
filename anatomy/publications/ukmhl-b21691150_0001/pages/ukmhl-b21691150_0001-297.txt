DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 163 processes uot rarely involve also the vessel walls; as soon as the internal layers of the intima are attacked a plentiful invasion of tubercle bacilli occurs into the blood current, and a hmmatogenous general infection, an acute terminal general miliary tuberculosis, results. Besides, there is frequently a more benign and slower development of metastases (chronic or subclironic miliary tuberculosis), in which only isolated distant organs (particularly the spleen, kidneys, brain, bones, and joints) are implicated and at the autopsy are found to contain single or multiple larger tuberculous foci (solitary tubercles); the products of this second- ary metastatic tuberculosis are very inconstant with reference to localization and duration. In conclusion let us attempt to sketch the appear- ances to be observed on the post-mortem table in the majority of cases of fatal pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus in the first place we usually see on examining the pleura all possible degrees and stages of pleurisy —from the sero-fibrinous form of a few days’ stand- ing to a purulent and hemorrhagic inflammation with or without eruption of tubercles in the layers of the pleura; or else over the upper portions of the affected pulmonary parenchyma we find all grades of adhesive pleurisy with delicate spiderweb-like synechim or firm membranes which may reach the thickness of a finger and can hardly be detached; the lungs are usually increased in weight, their upper portions sunk in, the lower voluminous. The parenchyma presents almost invariably the appearance of recurrent disease. At the apex and about the entire upper lobe slaty cirrhotic and indu- rated processes with cavities are present; with ex-

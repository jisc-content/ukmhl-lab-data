ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 150 halation pneumonia, the so-called foreign-body pneu- monia. This is caused by the penetration into the bronchi of decomposable solid or liquid food, of in- fectious matter from the mouth, and of necrotic masses of exudation or tissue. Inhalation pneumo- nia likewise is found almost exclusively in the in- ferior and posterior segments of the lung; the initial stages resemble those of broncho-pneumonia described above; the infiltrated lobules, however, soon show a tendency to undergo gangrene and are offensive and discolored; the tissue becomes friable and dirty blackish; in place of the pus we find ichorous fluid, the covering pleura is also implicated, i.e., purulent and sanious pleurisy result. Inhalation pneumonia is observed especially in patients whose power of deglutition is impaired, in grave forms of fever with clouded consciousness, in the insane, in diseases of the brain and its meninges, and largely also in pa- tients fed artificially; it occurs, besides, when a car- cinoma of the oesophagus perforates into the trachea or bronchi. Croupous or Fibrinous Pneumonia. (Plates 26 and 27.) This is an acute infectious primary inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma, caused in the majority of cases by the diplococcus pneumonias (Frankel- Weichselbaum). The exudation is cellulo-fibrinous and hemorrhagic; the disease is lobar, rarely lobu- lar, sometimes involving the whole lung, and associ- ated with pleurisy (pleuro-pneumonia) and croupous ascending bronchitis. Analogous to the clinical picture, the process shows

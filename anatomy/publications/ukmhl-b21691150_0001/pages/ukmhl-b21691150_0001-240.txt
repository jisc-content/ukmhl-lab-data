106 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. in color, and tlie cut surface lias a more or less lar- daceous lustre, according to tlie degree and tlie stage of the disease. The focal variety is characterized by the localization of the process in the Malpighian cor- puscles, which are swollen to the size of a hempseed or a pea and lie in the shape of light gray, glassy, translucent granules, resembling boiled sago, in the red splenic tissue (sago spleen). On the addition of a solution of iodine the amyloid parts assume a dark mahogany-brown color, the normal tissue becoming straw yellow; a watery solution of methyl violet stains the diseased parts a ruby red, while the nor- - mal tissue presents a dark blue color. DISEASES OF THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. The lymphatic glands are, as it were, filters for the micro-parasitic' germs of infection and for foreign bodies, both of which penetrate from the periphery by way of the lymph channels. Thus, for instance, the peribronchial lymphatic glands contain invari- ably particles of soot and carbon which have entered through the intact pulmonary tissue, and after tattoo- ing of the forearm with cinnabar particles of the same pigment are present in the axillary glands. In the case of numerous infectious substances, c.g., the bacilli of tuberculosis, typhoid fever, anthrax, pyo- genic fungi, the poisons of syphilis and gonorrhoeaâ€” the parenchyma of the lymphatic glands constitutes a fruitful field for the colonization and multiplica- tion of the germs; in like manner the lymphatic glands participate secondarily, almost without excep- tion, in carcinomatous disease of peripheral organs.

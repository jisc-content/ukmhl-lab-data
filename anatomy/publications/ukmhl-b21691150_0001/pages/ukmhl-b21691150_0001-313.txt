DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 179 Neoplasms of the organs of the mouth are rather frequent, especially carcinoma of the lips and tongue. Cancer of the lip, most often situated on the lower lip, occurs, like cancer of the tongue, chiefly in men, rarely in women (10:1); the smoking of acrid to- bacco, especially in clay pipes, and shaving with dull razors are given as the main causes of cancer of the lip. Superficial and deep forms are distin- guished. Cancer of the tongue commences, as a rule, at the margins. Ranula is the term applied to roundish or oval cysts with tenacious contents, situated under the tongue close to the frenulum; they are retention cysts due to occlusion and dilatation of the mucous glands (Blandin-Nuhn glands) located near the tip of the tongue. Or else they develop as retention cysts from Wharton’s duct or from the efferent ducts of the sub- lingual glands, when these passages are obstructed by inflammatory processes or calculi. Besides, we find on the floor of the mouth lymphangiomata, der- moid cysts, branchial cysts (congenital cystic hy- gromata), which crowd upward from the neck and lift the floor of the oral cavity. Connective-tissue tumors about the cavity of the mouth are sometimes observed; the most frequent forms are fibromata and sarcomata springing from the connective-tissue portions of the mucosa, from the submucosa, from the periosteum and bones of the maxilla (periosteal sarcomata or myelogenous sar- comata). Tumors developing on the gums are known collectively as “epulis.”

195 DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. Neoplasms of the Stomach Cancer of the stomach is very frequent, constituting from one-fourth to one-third of all carcinomas; men are attacked more often than women (7:5). The dis- ease is most common between the fortieth and sixtieth year of life, there being hardly any difference between the various classes of society. The sites of predilec- tion of gastric cancer are the pylorus and its neigh- borhood and the lesser curvature; the cardia, the anterior and posterior wall are more rarely affected. As a rule, the tumor is circumscribed, exceptionally it is spread diffusely over the greater portion of the gastric wall (infiltrated cancer). The typical forms are medullary or glandular can- cer, scirrhus or hard cancer, and colloid cancer. At first the carcinoma is always parietal and tends to spread superficially and, particularly at the py- lorus, annularly. Medullary carcinoma usually presents tumid, ele- vated margins, and is semi-soft in consistence, with an ulcerating surface of irregular form in the centre. In some cases the cancer constitutes a fungoid mass of a reddish color, is not very prone to break down, and is quite vascular (carcinoma telangiectodes), with a tendency to hemorrhages. The gastric contents re- semble coffee grounds and consist of altered blood. Hard cancer (scirrhus or fibro-carcinoma) may be circumscribed to the pylorus; the infiltrated wall creaks under the knife, and hardly any juice can be scraped from the thickened wall. Ulceration is often very limited; shallow losses of substance may be seen

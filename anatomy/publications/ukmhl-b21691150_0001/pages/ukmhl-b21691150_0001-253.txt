THYROID GLAND. 119 especially nervous disturbances, is also known as Base- dow’s or Graves’ disease. In some parts of the world goitre occurs endemi- cally with great frequency. In its degenerative forms (fibrocystic goitre) it is often associated with creti- nism, stunted growth, and pronounced physical and mental defects. The same condition also develops within a few years after complete extirpation of the thyroid gland in young subjects, in the form of ca- chexia strumipriva (Fig. 4). Aside from senile atrophy, which is rare, we occa- sionally observe atrophy of the thyroid gland due to unknown causes; it is followed by a similar condition as in cachexia strumipriva (myxoedema atrophicum). Malignant new formations (struma maligna) de- velop with special frequency in the enlarged thyroid gland; carcinoma more rarely than round-celled sar- coma. Within a few months the gland attains a large size and by pressure and constriction of the trachea, larynx, and oesophagus terminates fatally.

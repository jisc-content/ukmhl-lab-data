ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 246 tissue trabeculae. While the normal gland weighs from 80 to 100 gm. (8 to 3^ oz.) it is reduced to about one-half of this weight when atrophy is present. Necrosis of the pancreas results sometimes from hemorrhages or inflammatory processes. A special form is so-called fat necrosis, i.e., the development of multiple opaque whitish foci, which may be as large as a hempseed, with or without central softening; multiple fat necrosis is sometimes combined with various forms of pancreatitis. As regards the relation of pancreatic disease to diabetes it should be observed that marked destruc- tion and diffuse disease of the gland are usually as- sociated with diabetes. The pancreatic affections which, as it were, form the basis of certain varieties of diabetes, are many, i.e., inflammatory atrophy, atrophy by the occlusion of the efferent duct, by pressure, cyst formation, necrotic processes, and neo- plasms. In general we observe diabetes in two-thirds of all pancreatic affections; in one-third it is absent. In some cases in which the pancreas is only slightly altered functional disturbances of the gland may be the cause of the diabetes. Calculi and concretions in the efferent ducts cause their occlusion, with secondary atrophy and cyst formation in the gland.

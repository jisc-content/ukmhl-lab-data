210 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. are plentiful, most abundant in the lower portions of the ileum, and scattered here and there also in the duodenum and stomach. The average mortality is fifty per cent. Dysentery. The sporadic is to be distinguished from the acute epidemic form. The location of the disease, a hem- orrhagic necrosing colitis and proctitis, is in the large intestine, the most intense changes being found in the rectum and the lower portion of the colon. The mucous membrane is enormously swollen, almost fluctuating on touch, of a dark brownisli-red color, and infiltrated with sero-cellular and hemor- rhagic exudate. The contents of the bowel are usu- ally mixed with blood and foetid. Owing to the necrosis of the upper layers of the mucosa a branny deposit is rapidly formed; as the process advances the mucosa is discolored greenish-yellow or greenish- grav, especially on the acme of the folds. In the further course the eschars are cast off, leaving in the mucosa, which is sprinkled with slaty spots, irregu- lar ulcers that eventually heal and produce cicatricial stenoses of the intestine. In the tropics dysentery is far more frequent and severe than in temperate zones. The cause of tropi- cal dysentery is said to be a protozoon (Amoeba dys- enteric), which, however, is â–  always found to be associated with pathogenic bacteria. Under the collective term of sporadic dysentery is understood an entire group of septic or toxic forms of colitis which present anatomical alterations similar to those of acute dysentery. This group includes

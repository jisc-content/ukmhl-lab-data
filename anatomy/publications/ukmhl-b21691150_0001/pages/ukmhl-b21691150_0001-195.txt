PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Circulatory Apparatus, Spleen, Lymphatic Glands, and Thyroid Gland. DISEASES OF THE PERICARDIUM. The diseases of the pericardium resemble in their etiological and anatomical relations those of serous membranes in general; only the tendency to tubercu- lous affections is less than that of the pleura and the peritoneum. By far the most important anomaly of the pericar- dium is inflammation, namely: Pericarditis. (Plate 1.) A distinction is to be made between the acute exu- dative forms and the chronic or terminated adhesive forms with partial or total obliteration of the peri- cardium. Beside sero-fibrinous and hemorrhagic pericarditis we may mention purulent pericarditis, which is rare, and finallly tuberculous inflammation of the pericar- dium. Aside from the traumatic form, idiopathic pericar-

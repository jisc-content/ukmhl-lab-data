DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 207 spots, projecting several millimetres above tlie level of the mucous membrane; on incision the proliferated gland tissue appears reddish-gray, and of semi-soft medullary consistence. In the second stage (stage of cicatrization), which begins about the eighth to the tenth day, the swelling of the follicular glands begins to subside and the process recedes in mild cases, the glands acquiring a reticulated and often somewhat slaty gray appear- ance. Or else, in the typical course, with the tenth day begins the cicatrization of the infiltrations, that process frequently commencing at several points of the surface; the necrotic eschars, owing to the stain- ing with bile, are of a dirty yellowish color and often fissured; the necrosing and diphtheroid process may also involve the submucosa and the muscular tunic. In the third stage, which occupies about the third week, the eschars are cast off and ulcers form, having an oblong shape corresponding to the arrangement of the patches of Peyer, while tuberculous ulcers are more transversely placed and circular or ring-like in form. Owing to a demarcating inflammation, the eschars are first loosened, then cast off; the bottom and margin of the ulcer are irregular and jagged; erosion of vessels may occasion more or less profuse hemorrhage. In the fourth stage (stage of recovery), whose dura- tion varies aud which occupies the fourth and fifth weeks, the ulcers clear and heal; the regenerative process starts from the margin and bottom of the ulcers and reproduces especially connective tissue and epithelium, but never causes the formation of cica- trices and stenosis of the bowel.

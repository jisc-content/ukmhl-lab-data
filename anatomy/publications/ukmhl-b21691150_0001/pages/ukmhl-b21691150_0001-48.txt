Explanation of Plate 12. Aneurism of the Basilar Artery and of the Vertebral Arteries. (Rupture, Intermeningeal Hemorrhage, Secondary Chronic In- ternal Hydrocephalus in a Boy Aged Seven Years.) % Over the lower part of the pons is an aneurismal dila- tation, the size of a walnut, of the basilar artery. Per- foration the size of a lentil, effusion of blood into the subarachnoid spaces at the base of the brain. The junction of the two vertebral arteries is involved in the aneurism. The right vertebral artery is twice the size of the left. The basilar artery springs from the anterior surface of the aneurism exactly in the median line. Nothing definite could be ascertained as to the etiology; syphilis was excluded. In the third year of life the patient had suffered an injury (a blow on the head with a hammer). Marked morbid disturbances did not ap- pear until six days before death—Cheyne-Stokes respira- tion, spasm of the extremities, rise of temperature to 38 C. = 100.4° F., acceleration of the pulse, finally sopor. Among 37 cases of aneurism of the basilar arterj- and the vertebral arteries described in the literature, only 3 patients were between twenty and twenty-nine, one be- tween ten and nineteen years old. (The present case is described at greater length in the paper by Willibald Oppe, entitled “ Ein Fall von Aneurysma der Arteria basilarisbei einem siebenjahrigen Knaben,” Miinch. vied. Abhandlungen, 24 Heft, 1892.) 12

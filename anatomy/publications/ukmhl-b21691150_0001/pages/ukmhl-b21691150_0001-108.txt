Explanation of Plate 32. Carcinoma of the Pleura. Cancerous Pleurisy Secondary to Carcinoma of the Stomach. In the pleura, largely transparent as it is, we see numerous whitish-gray spots corresponding to flat foci most of which extend into the lung tissue, here and there coalescing; at other points a grayish-white reticulated appearance may be noted. The lungs are very large and heavy (the left lung weighing 800 gm. = 28 oz., the right 980 gm. = 351 oz.), in consistence resembling the spleen. On the cut surface we observe scattered light gray irregular patches, similar to those in fibrous tuberculous peribronchitis; in the inferior lobe smaller nodules and masses of a like nature, most of them from a pinâ€™s head to a hempseed in size. Cause of death of the patient, a woman aged twenty- nine years (No. 507, 1895), carcinoma of the stomach, localized in the pyloric portion and involving the left lobe of the liver; secondary cancerous infiltration of the epigastric, retroperitoneal, and intrathoracic lymph glands, of the lungs and pleura (in the last in the form of a carcinomatous, subpleural lymphangitis). The case, aside from its anatomical peculiarities, is remarkable on account of the relative youth of the patient. 32

Transverse section of the heart, injected with alcohol in the cadaver; the normal heart being placed alongside for comparison. Anatomically this disease is characterized by the nearly uniform impli- cation of both ventricles. The muscle is firm, rigid, usually of a dark-red color; the trabeculee and the papillary musces are powerfully developed throughout. The primitive muscular bundles appear widened, perhaps also numerically increased, and the connective-tissue stroma is likewise increased. The valves are normal. The weight of the heart rises from 300-350 gm. = 10J4-12J4 oz. (normal) to 540-600 gm. = 19-21 oz. and more. Idiopathic hypertrophy and dilata- tion affect usually powerfully built and well-nourished persons, who are often distinguished by great width of the arteries and an abundance of blood. When a fatal issue results, which is due to heart failure, the aver- age age is forty to forty-three years. The large majority of the cases be- longing to this category may be explained by the habitual excess in the consumption of beer or wine in connection with true plethora; the toxic effect of the alcohol, the physical action of the large amounts of fluid, and Anally the nutritive qualities of the beer being factors in the result. Associated excessive muscular labor and bodily exertions often favor the development of this cardiac hypertrophy.

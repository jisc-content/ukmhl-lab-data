Acute bronchitis may be localized in the larger or smaller bronchi and is found in all possible grada- tions, from the milder forms beginning with sero- mucous secretion to the intense purulent variety with abundant, thick, creamy or greenish-yellow secretion (blennorrhoea). When expectoration has been insuffi- cient, as in cases of debilitated patients, in advanced or very early age, the bronchi are found filled with yellowish-white purulent secretion; when, after the pulmonary parenchyma is divided and the cut surface is carefully scraped, light pressure is exerted upon the tissue, the medium-sized and smaller bronchi give exit to purulent plugs which are easily seen. Chronic bronchitis is extremely frequent in disease of the pulmonary parenchyma (tuberculosis, emphy- sema) and of the heart (congestive bronchitis). The mucous membrane, which is generally swollen, is of a brownish-red color and the surface is covered with tough muco-purulent masses; when the process ter- minates in atrophy of the mncosa, secondaiy bronchi- ectasis sometimes follows. Croupous or fibrinous bronchitis develops either downward in connection with the same inflammation of the trachea and larynx, or in the inverse direction, upward, in croupous pneumonia. In the lumen of the bronchi, whose mucosa is greatly swollen and reddened, are solid or tubular branching coagula of a pale yellowish or grayish-white color, which can

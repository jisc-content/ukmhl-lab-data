ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 144 Diseases Due to the Inhalation of Dust. Pneumonoconiosis. (Plate 25.) The air spaces of the lung continually take up par- ticles of clust; a portion of this passes out again with the expired air and the bronchial secretion, and a portion is retained in the pulmonary tissue, being partly fixed in the parenchyma, partly transported farther along the lymph channels. With reference to the pathogenic influence of the several kinds of dust the following points are of importance: the quality and quantity of the dust, the duration of the daily period of inhalation, the fact whether the dust is in- spired continuously or at intervals, and also the vul- nerability of the lung and of the individual. Healthy lungs are better able to expel the dust again, while it is more easily and in larger amounts retained in dis- eased organs. The dust particles, which can be demonstrated microscopically and chemically both in the pulmo- nary tissue and in the peribronchial glands, are taken up by the alveolar wall and carried along in the juice and lymph current, either free or inclosed in phago- cytes. A portion is retained in the lungs, where it causes different pathological processes. The dust deposited in the pulmonary tissue is partly intracel- lular, partly free. While the alveolar walls as a rule show but little deposited dust, this is found more abundantly in the peri-infundibular, peribronchial, perivascular, and subpleural connective tissue.

91 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. sclerosis may develop primarily and, as stated above, induce a secondary dilatation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle; this type includes especially the senile forms of arteriosclerosis which occur after the fiftieth year of life and the postsypliilitic fibrous and gummous aortitis in younger persons. Excessive physical exertions also favor its occurrence, although in animals (horses, draught oxen, and dogs) which perform hard and prolonged muscular labor this vas- cular disease, that occupies so prominent a place in human pathology, is almost unknown. (2) In a sec- ond group hypertrophy of the heart and arteriosclero- sis develop in a co-ordinated way on the same basis; the same causes (alcoholism, high living, plethora, overexertion) produce simultaneously cardiac hy- pertrophy with dilatation and chronic endarteritis. (3) The third group includes those cases in which the primary hypertrophy of the heart, owing to the increased chronic pressure, causes a reaction on the part of the intima of the aorta which takes the form of a fibrous and indurated endarteritis. Especial^ when associated with general nutritive disturbances (chronic nephritis and albuminuria) cardiac hyper- trophy exerts a marked injurious influence upon the more minute arborizations of the arteries. This is the explanation of the marked frequency of cerebral apoplexy in hypertrophy of the left ventricle, whose pathogenic influence (chronic increase of the arterial pressure) is in many cases of apoplexy of greater im- portance than the degeneration of the cerebral arter- ies, which is sometimes slight. In the distribution of some arteries (for instance, in the kidneys) the hyper- trophy of the heart gives rise to compensatory sclero-

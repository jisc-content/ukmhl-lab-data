Explanation of Plate 6. Chronic Fibrous Endocarditis op the Mitral Valve, Associated with Considerable Stenosis and Insufficiency. (Endocarditis Chronica Fibrosa Retrahens.) The leaflets of the valve show a marked callous thick- ening; they are almost cartilaginous, excessively short- ened, and form rigid, firm masses; the tendinous cords are barely recognizable. The place of the latter is taken by short cords thicker than a knitting-needle, which im- mediately unite the rigid valve tissue with the likewise callous indurated papillary muscles. At the circular line of attachment of the mitral valve calcareous masses are deposited. The ostium of the valve is extremely ste- nosed, barely admitting a thick lead pencil. Among the associated conditions were hypertrophy and dilatation of the left auricle, of the right ventricle and auricle, brown induration of the lungs (chronic engorgement), to- gether with adhesive pericarditis and fatty infiltration of the heart. The left ventricle was also hypertrophied, perhaps in connection with inflammatory, smooth, contracted kid- neys. The patient (No. 335, 1894), aged seventy-two, from whom the specimen was obtained had suffered, moreover, during the last year of her life from a peculiar hemorrhagic diathesis which manifested itself by the fact that the least local lesion of the surface caused extensive ecchymoses.

DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 159 catecl by mixed infection (accidental infection with staphylococci, diplococci, and streptococci); the so- called hectic fever in phthisis is usually due to an infection with streptococci and belongs to the group of septic fevers. Pulmonary tuberculosis begins in the apex of the lung, where it causes at first a circumscribed inflam- mation terminating in caseation or fibrous, callous in- duration (slaty cicatricial foci of an irregular form, usually situated immediately under the pleura, and associated with adhesive pleurisy). The slaty and indurated foci generally contain cheesy patches from a hempseed to a cherry in size (Plate 28, Fig. a), which when well encapsulated frequently show a ten- dency to a mortar-like inspissation and calcification. In unfavorable cases we see at the margins of the cheesy patches minute gray and grayish-yellow nod- ules (miliary tubercles), the result of regional infec- tion, which, growing slowly or rapidly, coalesce with the primary focus and lead to its enlargement. From the apex of the lung the tuberculous process spreads downward first to the superior lobe, partly by continuity, partly by way of the lymph channels, or by communicating with a bronchus, by way of aspiration and intrabroncliially, into previously nor- mal portions of the lung. As a result of the intra- broncliial transportation of the tuberculous virus, there occurs, in a centrifugal direction, a series of processes which must be interpreted partly as bron- cho-pneumonic, partly as peribronchitic tuberculous inflammations (Plate 30). In favorable cases and with a certain resistance of the patients, pre-eminently fibrous forms of peribronchitis (peribronchitis fibrosa

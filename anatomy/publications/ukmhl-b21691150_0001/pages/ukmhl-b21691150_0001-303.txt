DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 169 to the quantity of the transudation, which may reach two to three litres (quarts), the posterior and inferior segments of the lung appear collapsed and compressed (compression atelectasis). Inflammation of the Pleura. Pleurisy or Pleu- ritis. Pleurisy, an extremely frequent disease, occurs in numerous forms and gradations, and according to its duration is divided into acute, subacute, and chronic; or, according to its etiology, into infectious and non- infectious; or, according to its results, into exudative and productive (adhesive) forms, with numerous transitions. Corresponding to the essentially secondary nature of pleurisy, the duration and form of the inflamma- tion depend usually upon the variety and course of the primary pulmonary affection, especially pneu- monic and tuberculous processes. In the latter we generally find recurrent forms of pleurisy, i.e., over the upper parts of the lung adhesive pleurisy which has run its course; over the middle and lower por- tions of the lung, recent and usually exudative pleu- risy. Aside from the lung (metapneumonic pleurisy) the disease develops also by contiguity from other neighboring organsâ€”from the mediastinum, from the lymphatic glands of the root of the lung and of the mediastinum, from the pericardium, and from the abdominal cavity; now and then it may be hsemato- genous and metastatic from distant organs. Anatomically the following principal forms may be distinguished:

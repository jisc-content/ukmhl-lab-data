Explanation of Plate 7. Chronic Fibrous and Calcareous Endocarditis of the Aortic Valves. While the normal valves of the heart are delicate, translucent, and movable, the aortic valves in the pres- ent case are rigid, moderately thickened, and partly set with calcareous incrustations—the appearance of deform- ing, hyperplastic, and calcareous endocarditis with moderate stenosis and insufficiency of the aortic valves. The adjoining portions of the ascending aorta are similarly opacified here and there, and show points of calcification in the region of the thickened intima. Owing to the valvular affection hypertrophy and dila- tation of the entire heart developed, the left ventricle being most markedly involved (weight of the heart, 565 gm. = 20 oz., to body weight of 60 kgm. = 132 lb.). Other conditions found in the patient (No. 26, 1895), aged fifty-nine years, were congestion of the various organs, with swelling of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, slight anasarca of both feet and legs, and moderate pul- monary emphysema. Death was due to exhaustion of the heart, shown anatomically by marasmic thrombosis of the right auricle. The disease had lasted several years, during which the patient’s working-power was reduced. The patient, a carpenter, had suffered much from “asthma;” in former years he had worked very hard at his trade, and had drunk brandy like other workmen, but not to excess. 8

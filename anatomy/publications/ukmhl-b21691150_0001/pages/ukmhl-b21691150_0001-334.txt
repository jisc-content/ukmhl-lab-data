ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 200 confined to some segments of tlie bowel or occurs diffusely in tlie small and large intestine. Redden- ing, swelling, increased accumulation of mucus, aug- mentation and fluidity of tlie contents are the most important characteristics. A particularly dangerous form is infectious gastro- enteritis in infants (cholera infantum, summer diar- rhoea of children). This is due to the effect of sapro- phytes which by their fermentative activity produce poisonous chemical substances (ptomains), causing grave and frequently fatal auto-intoxication. It is probable that a continuance of ectogenous processes of decomposition in bottle-fed children plays a part in the affection. While in the upper portions of the bowel abnormal lactic-acid fermentation and decom- position of sugar predominate, in the lower portions alkaline fermentation and decomposition of albumi- nous bodies take place. At the autopsy we find the intestinal contents tliin-fluid and usually of a pene- trating offensive odor; the mucosa is pale, the epi- thelium loosened and in many places desquamated, the follicles are largely swollen, i.e., a septic and septiform enteritis. While the gastric juice by rea- son of its contained hydrochloric acid has some bac- tericide and antiseptic properties, these are only lim- ited, and the digestive ferments exert no protective influence in this direction. Under the influence of the disturbed chemical activity, of the abnormal processes of decomposition and fermentation, harm- less intestinal micro-organisms become pathogenic (facultative parasites); the serous transudation and the increased intestinal secretion contain much serum-albumin and mucin, greater quantities of

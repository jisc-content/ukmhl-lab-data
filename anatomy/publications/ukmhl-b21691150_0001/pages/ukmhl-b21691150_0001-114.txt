Explanation of Plate 34. Abscess of the Posterior and Lateral Pharyn- geal Wall (Para- and Retro-pharyngeal Ab- scess). Sanious abscess, the size of a large plum, developed without demonstrable cause from a submucous circum- scribed phlegmonous inflammation. The abscess had caused a peracute septicaemia, i.e., metastatic purulent fibrinous pleurisy of the left side, moderate swelling of the spleen, and parenchymatous hepatitis. The patient was a man aged forty-two years (No. 424, 1895). Clinically and anatomically the condition was similar to angina Ludovici, in which the abscesses, cryptogenic in their origin, are met with in the region of the base of the tongue, the lower maxilla, and the submaxillary region. 34

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 172 crowded toward the opposite side. As the exudation becomes absorbed the previously atelectatic j>ortions of the lung again expand; the longer the exudate has remained and the compression has continued, the more difficult and imperfect is the expansion of the lung. The impairment of the lung by a preceding healed pleurisy will always be less in proportion to the rapidity of the course of the inflammation and of the absorption of the exudate. In the majority of cases of adhesive pleurisy—particularly with com- plete obliteration of the pleural space, which is occa- sionally discovered accidentally at autopsies—the lung is diminished in size. More marked retraction of the lung causes shrinking of the corresponding thoracic cavity, curvature of the spine (scoliosis) toward the healthy side, and descent of the shoulder on the side of the retracting pleurisy. Long-standing pleural ex- udations interfere with the pulmonary circulation and when the nutritive conditions are at all favorable cause dilatation and hypertrophy of the right heart, peripheral venous congestion, and frequently also chronic bronchitis. Extension of the process to the pericardium and more rarely to the diaphragmatic peritoneum is sometimes observed. Etiology.—Although colds, overexertion, and in- juries play a certain role (pleurisy is three or four times more frequent in men than in women), the ma- jority of the cases is of an infectious origin. Even in the apparently benign sero-fibrinous pleurisy pyo- genic organisms can sometimes be demonstrated as causes; besides it is frequently indirectly of tubercu- lous origin, developing by a kind of remote effect in connection with latent or demonstrable pulmonary

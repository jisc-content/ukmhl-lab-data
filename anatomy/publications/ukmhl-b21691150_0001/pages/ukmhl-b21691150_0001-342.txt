208 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. pigmentation of the affected portions forms in the later stages of typhoid fever one of the residues of the above-described metamorphoses. When the course is normal, free from complications, the anatomical process in the intestine may have run its course at the end of a month. Owing to the associated catarrhal inflammation of the bowel, the contents of the small intestine and colon are usually thin, offensive, and of the consistence and color of pea soup. A complication to be dreaded is perforation of the ulcers, which occurs in or after the third week and may cause fatal perforation peri- tonitis. In some cases the course is slow, so that even in the fifth, sixth, and seventh weeks open, slate-colored ulcers can be demonstrated; or else in the third week or later a relapse occurs (auto-rein- fection) . In rare cases a true gangrene of the intes- tine develops from the eschars, whose place is taken by irregular, friable, extremely foetid masses. Septic and pysemic mixed infection, starting from the eschars and ulcers, is at times superadded in all pos- sible gradations. Partial eschar formation and puru- lent disintegration are sometimes found in the hyper- plastic mesenteric glands and in the spleen. Among other complications occurring in typhoid fever more frequently than in any other infectious disease may be enumerated parenchymatous inflammation and fatty degeneration of the heart, liver, and kidneys, bronchitis, pneumonia, and bed-sores. In the ma- jority of cases (sixty to seventy per cent) the fatal issue in typhoid fever is due to complications (mixed infection), in the minoritj" to the intensity of the in- fection. As regards the time when death takes place,

ATLAS Of PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 82 Chronic Endocarditis.* (Plate 5, Fig. a; Plates 6, 7, and 8.) Chronic endocarditis forms the anatomical basis of so-called valvular defects; it is largely a productive inflammation with a tendency to callous thickening, shortening, and calcification of the valves, which appear more or less deformed. In the same way as the valves, with their sparse and in part absent vessels, present anatomically and functionally many analogies with the intima of the aorta, so also do the chronic inflammatory processes show several similaritiesâ€”the slow and progressive development, the tendency to the formation of in- durated firm products, and the liability to deformity and calcification are common to both. Chronic fibrous endocarditis develops either from the acute rheumatic form, constituting as it were one of its residues, or it does so slowly and gradually from insignificant beginnings in middle and advanced age. This presenile and senile endocarditis, espe- cially at the aortic valves, is often nothing else than a continuation of sclerosis of the aorta, which, extend- ing to the aortic valves, thickens and shortens them. Owing to a slowly progressive augmentation of connective tissue, the valves, which are normally deli- cate, movable, and translucent, become at first spotted with whitish and yellowish opacities; as their thick- ness increases they lose their mobility and appear stiff and short.

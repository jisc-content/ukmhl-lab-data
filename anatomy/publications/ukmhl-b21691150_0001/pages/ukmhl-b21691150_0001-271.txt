DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 137 riplieral veins. When a primary thrombus cannot be found we must remember that it is possible that an autochthonous marasmic thrombosis in the course of the branches of the pulmonary artery may likewise cause the development of infarctions; finally the pri- mary thrombus may also have been completely swept away without leaving a trace. When the embolus is infectious, it acts not only mechanically, interfering with the circulation, but it causes along the distribution of the occluded artery a circumscribed purulent inflammation, the formation of metastatic abscesses, which are usually multiple and subpleural in their location and give rise to sec- ondary jmrulent pleurisy. Such pulmonary abscesses constitute the anatomical substratum of embolic sep- tico-pyaemia, such as may develop, for instance, in connection with infected wounds or with septic puer- peral metrophlebitis and terminate fatally. (Edema of the Lung. (Edema represents a very frequent anomaly of the pulmonary tissue and occurs in various forms and gradations, either distributed uniformly over both lungs or confined to isolated regions, especially the jiosterior and inferior portions of the lung after the horizontal dorsal position has been long maintained by the patient. The tissue appears more or less water-logged, with corresponding diminution of the contained air, the weight is increased, the consistence in the higher grades is doughy and almost resembling that of the spleen, the volume is augmented; the con- tained blood variesâ€”in oedema of very rapid develop-

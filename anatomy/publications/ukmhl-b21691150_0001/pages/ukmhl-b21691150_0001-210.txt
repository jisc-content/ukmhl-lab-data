76 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. heart, a certain quantity of fat which, when the mus- cular structure is properly developed, is within the normal limits. In general obesity, particularly the form which develops under the favoring influence of alcohol, we often find pathological varieties of fatty heart, characterized by an enormous increase of the fatty envelope of the heart, whose thickness may reach 0.5-1 cm.=-|—f inch. The demarcation of the fatty layer from the muscle, which is normally quite sharp, is obliterated; the fat proliferates between the muscular bundles, displacing them, and secondarily produces atroxihy of the muscular substance, which is especially marked at the right ventricle. Aside from general obesity and alcoholism, an- other variety of fatty heart occurs in amende, chlo- rotic, and cachectic subjects (particularly in cancer patients), i.e., the cachectic fatty heart. In this va- riety we observe primary atrophy of the muscular structure and secondary proliferation of fat, as it were ex vacuo. Atrophy of the Heart. Atrophy of the heart should be clearly differenti- ated from hypoplasia of the organ; the latter consists in defective development and abnormal smallness of the heart, present since childhood. It is usually as- sociated with abnormal narrowness and thinness of the aorta and the larger vessels, also with chronic anaemia and chlorosis—a condition which is generally connected with stunted bodily development. True atrophy of the heart, which rarely reaches a high degree, is characterized by diminution of vol- ume and weight (to two-thirds to one-half of the nor-

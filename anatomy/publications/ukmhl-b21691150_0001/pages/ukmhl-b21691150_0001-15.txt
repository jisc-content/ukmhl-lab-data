Explanation of Plate 1. Acute Serofibrinous and Hemorrhagic Peri- carditis. (The heart is not opened.) The greater portion of the pericardium is covered with a reddish-gray pseudo-membrane, whose surface presents at many points a reticulated and villous arrange- ment. On the anterior surface of the right ventricle toward the apex the inflamed epicardium appears smoother, with a reddish-yellow discoloration; at this point the exudation shows beginning organization and can be removed only with difficulty. The interior of the pericardium contains at the same time about a wine- glassful of a turbid sero-sangumolent fluid mixed with a few fibrinous flakes. In the present case the pericarditis was obviously due to a preceding tuberculous pneumonia and pleuritis. Other associated conditions found were long-standing cheesy tuberculosis of the peribronchial and mesenteric lymphatic glands, and acute miliary tuberculosis of the liver, spleen, and kidneys. 1

Explanation of Plate 4. Malignant Mycotic Endocarditis of the Mitral Valve. On the inner surface of the median valve are found irregular, tubercular, fissured, semisoft deposits of a dull gray discolored appearance; the surface of these masses, which consist chiefly of thrombotic formations and micro-organisms, is covered with layers made up of red blood corpuscles and fibrin. The underlying tissue of the valve and the adjoining endocardium of the left auricle are in a condition of ulcerating and necrosing in- flammation, and after the deposited thrombi are de- tached look as if gnawed into. Corresponding to the line of closure of the mitral valve we find a larger number of reddish-gray papillary excrescences consisting mainly of young connective tis- sue. The valvular disease produces insufficiency and stenosis; moreover, valves thus affected very frequently give rise to emboli in the distribution of the aorta, with the formation of purulent metastases (embolic abscesses) in the brain, the spleen, the kidneys, etc. (embolic sep- tico-pyaemia). The heart figured in Plate 4 was derived from a puerpera, aged twenty-nine years (No. 333, 1894), dead of puerperal endometritis and septico-pyaemia. Besides the mycotic verrucose endocarditis there were embolic renal infarctions, purulent leptomeningitis, and flabby croupous pneumonia of the right lower lobe, with secondary pyofibrinous pleuritis.

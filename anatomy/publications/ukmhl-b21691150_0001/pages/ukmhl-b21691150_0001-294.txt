ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 160 et nodosa) develop, which permeate the healthy lung tissue in a lobular or agglomerated arrangement; we notice slaty-gray firm foci whose margins are sur- rounded by a circle of minute gray and grayish-yel- low nodules resulting from regional and contiguous infection. Or else we find in the middle and inferior segments of the lungs markedly lobular, reddish- gray, friable, or yellowish cheesy, usually broncho- pneumonic patches, which iu the worst cases are so numerous that they become confluent and the cheesy lobular pneumonia changes into a lobar subacute pneumonia (Plate 29). In the latter case the lung is voluminous, rather heavy, and liver-like in consist- ence ; the tissue is airless and friable, the cut surface of a whitish-yellow color and bloodless. Tuberculous pneumonia—in the form of a malig- nant, rapidly progressive inflammation which de- stroys the lung tissue—therefore occurs in a lobar, lobular, and sublobular type; the latter represents a kind of miliary cheesy pneumonia in which the alve- olar structure can still be recognized with the micro- scope, while it is obliterated in true miliary and soli- tary tubercles (tuberculous granulomata). The cirrhotic processes which play a prominent part in tuberculosis of tardy course extending over months and years are the result of a chronic inter- stitial productive inflammation, and the tissue is usually heavily loaded with pigment (soot)—slaty cirrhosis or induration. The tissue at the same time is largely firm and creaks under the knife; along with it are found streaky and branching whitish connective- tissue trabeculae which correspond to the thickened sheaths of the small bronchioles and vessels. The

Sinus thrombosis after suppuration of the middle ear has a tendency to extend centrally to the jugular vein; in one-fourth to one-third of all cases it may termi- nate in recovery with or without operation; often, however, purulent leptomeningitis supervenes. Sep- tic phlebitis resembles infectious processes of the connective tissue in general; the wall of the vein is usually infiltrated with pus, discolored, rotten, and friable; the intima becomes rough and uneven, as if corroded. Very soon thrombotic deposits are super- added, forming septic thrombo-phlebitis. In such a case the thrombosis is of secondary occurrence; on the other hand, a thrombus which has arisen in some way or has been transported in the circulation may produce a secondary disease of the wall of the vein, phlebitis. When such infectious thrombi of periph- eral origin enter the circulation, metastatic embolic abscesses result. A benign and productive endophlebitis is observed in the organization of thrombi, when a connective tissue rich in cells gradually replaces the coagulated â€˜ constituents of the blood. Thrombosis op the Veins. (Plate 13.) The formation of thrombi in the veins is frequently observed, either as secondary thrombosis in connec-

70 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. tion (reduced size of tlie lung); hypertrophy of the left ventricle is found mainly with chronic nephritis, sclerosis of the aorta and of the arteries in general. The so-called idiopathic hypertrophy of the heart, Fig. 1 a (usually combined with dilatation), is most common in certain forms of chronic alcoholism (beer drinkers), in which plethora (high living) and toxic influences are active pathogenic factors. This diag- nosis is admissible only when the ordinary anatomi- cal causes of cardiac hypertrophy (valvular disease, arteriosclerosis, nephritis, pulmonary disease, etc.) are absent. Hypertrophic portions of the heart are generally of firm consistence, sometimes having a board-like feel, and the trabeculae are strongly developed. The thickness of the walls being markedly influenced by the size of the cavities, the most reliable mode of de- termining the hypertrophy, i.e., the increased vol- ume, is that of weighing the heart after suitable cleansing of the chambers. "Very often the hypertrophy of the muscle is com- bined with dilatation (excentric hypertrophy) of the chambers of the heart; both anomalies are in many ways co-ordinated, being due to the same factorsâ€” plethora, increased quantity of blood, and toxic effect upon the heart. Simple dilatation results from increased internal pressure and is followed by a corresponding thinning of the wall; or else the dilatation depends upon a diminished tone and reduced resistance of the wall (passive form); it is met with in atrophy of the mus- cular structure, in degenerative conditions (fatty de- generation) , prolonged anaemia, and high fever.

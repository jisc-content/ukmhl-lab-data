Explanation of Plate 23. Chronic Pulmonary Engorgement. (Brown Induration.) The lung has a dark brownish-red color, is condensed, and of a firm, tough, almost fleshy consistence. The contained air is diminished; some rusty brown fluid escapes from the cut surface. The cause of the engorgement was at the autopsy found to be a recurrent verrucose and fibrous endocar- ditis of the mitral and aortic valves associated with stenosis and insufficiency; the tricuspid valve was similarly affected. The valvular disease was caused by articular rheumatism (No. 697, 1895). Secondary conditions found were hypertrophy and dilatation of the right and left heart and congested organs: engorgement of the spleen, nutmeg liver, cyanotic induration of the kidneys, congestive catarrh of the stomach, and general dropsy. The patient was a woman aged twenty-three years. 23

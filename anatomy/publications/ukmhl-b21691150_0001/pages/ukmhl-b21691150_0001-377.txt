DISEASES OF THE LIVER. 243 the liver with abundant material for bile formation, and this being formed in abnormally large amounts escapes into the blood. In some varieties of toxic icterus (e.g., in phosphorus poisoning) the changes in the liver (swelling of the cellular elements, espe- cially the epithelia of the bile ducts) suffice to explain the disease in a purely mechanical way. Circulatory disturbances in the liver—reduced pressure in the hepatic vessels (capillaries) below that in the bile ducts—are sufficient to cause icterus (this probably includes the variety occurring in the newly born). Chronic venous hyperaemia of the liver, such as is present in nutmeg liver, likewise produces a slight degree of icterus. Whether icterus (nervous form) can result from emotional excitement (anger) or from spasmodic con- traction of the ductus choledochus (spasmodic ic- terus,) e.g., in lead colic, is doubtful. A special variety of icterus, the occurrence of which has been disputed, is urobilin icterus, in which a faint yellow staining of the skin and tissues is produced by urobilin, an oxidation product of bilirubin. This variety includes icterus occurring in pneumonia with hemorrhagic infarctions, when haemoglobin is extrav- asated and changed into urobilin. Some investiga- tors look upon urobilin icterus as a slight grade of biliary icterus.

Explanation of Plate 18. Adenoma of the Thyroid Gland. Colloid Struma. Transverse section through the thyroid gland, which is enormously enlarged to the size of nearly two fists. The gland completely covers the anterior and lateral cervical region, begins on both sides in the neighborhood of the mastoid process, and reaches from the chin to the manu- brium sterni. The gland is rather firm in consistence, and distinct lobulation can be recognized laterally. Af- ter removal of the cervical organs it is found that the tumor surrounds anteriorly and laterally the larynx and trachea, leaving posteriorly only a narrow groove in which the oesophagus is embedded. From the thyroid cartilage downward to within a few centimetres above the bifurcation the larynx and trachea appear flattened like a sword sheath. The enlarged thyroid gland is hard to cut, the divided surface is of a grayish-red and gray- ish-yellow color; all over it may be seen embedded sago- like, yellowish, translucent colloid masses. Other conditions found in the patient, aged sixty years (No. 99, 1895), who was moribund when received at the hospital, were a considerable hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle (weight of the heart, 430 gm. = 15 oz.), ascites, anasarca of the lower extremities and of the subcutaneous tissue of the lateral and posterior portions of the trunk. Incidental findings were obsolete tuberculosis of both lungs, atrophy of the liver and spleen, and general emaciation. The immediate cause of death was not the marked stenosis of the trachea but the disease of the heart. The combination of goitre, cardiac hypertrophy, and exophthalmus produce during life a special morbid entity known as Basedow’s or Graves’ disease. 18

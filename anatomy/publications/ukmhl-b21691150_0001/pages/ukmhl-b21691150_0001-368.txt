ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 234 long-continued stasis of the bile and chronic inflam- mation of the bile ducts, e.g., experimentally after ligation of the ductus choledochus. Under the same head belongs also verminous cirrhosis of the liver in domestic animals (sheep and cattle) caused by dis- tomatosis; the morbid process is usually spread ir- regularly in spots throughout the liver; the marginal portions are as a rule more markedly affected than the central parts of the organ. Tuberculosis of the liver may occur as acute mili- ary tuberculosis; in the parenchyma and visible through the capsule we find more or less numerous gray, punctiform to pin-head-sized nodules (Plate 56). This form of tuberculosis is more frequent in children as a local phenomenon of general miliary tuberculosis; now and then it is seen as the expres- sion of the general terminal infection in chronic pul- monary tuberculosis of adults. More rarely the liver contains larger tuberculous foci, so-called solitary tubercles the size of a hempseed or pea, which are usually present in considerable numbers in the paren- chyma of the organ. As a result of central softening and liquefaction small cavities form, the contents of which may be bile stained when there is communica- tion with bile ducts. The most important animal parasite of the liver is the echinococcus, the early life stage of a small tape- worm with three segments infesting the dog, taenia echinococcus (Plate 55, Fig. b). Dogs acquire the corresponding scolices from domestic animals (sheep, cattle, or hogs), while the ova of the dogâ€™s taenia in turn infect the latter and man. The parasite forms cysts which take the place of the liver tissue and are

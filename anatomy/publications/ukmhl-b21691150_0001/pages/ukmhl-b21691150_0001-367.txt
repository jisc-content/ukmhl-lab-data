233 DISEASES OF THE LIVER. the microscope we notice in typical cases a moderate interacinous, together with a predominant intra- acinous, irregular proliferation of connective tissue; icterus is usually absent. In some cases a chronic icterus develops gradually and progressively for many months and even years to a fatal issue. In other cases with hypertrophic induration of the liver the connective-tissue proliferation is so slight that it will hardly explain the marked enlargement of the organ. In such cases, which present no other complication (congestion in the distribution of the portal vein), the condition is evidently a true hyper- trophy of the parenchyma with slight interstitial proliferation. Hypertrophic cirrhosis of the liver, which very rarely only is also found as the first stage of atrophic cirrhosis, occurs chiefly in men (ninety per cent of all cases) addicted to beer drinking (alco- holism). Often it constitutes an incidental condition, particularly in idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy and in tuberculosis; while a secondary splenic tumor is constantly found as a concomitant phenomenon, icterus occurs in only about one-fifth of all cases, and ascites is quite exceptional. The various forms of hepatic cirrhosis are fre- quently associated with moderate and high degrees of fatty infiltration; besides there is sometimes au adenoid proliferation of the bile ducts in the hyper- plastic interacinous connective tissue. In the etiol- ogy of chronic interstitial hepatitis toxic and infec- tious influences, especially alcoholism and syphilis, play a prominent part. A special though rare form of hepatic inflammation is biliary cirrhosis which develops in connection with

Inflammatory Pulmonary Tuberculosis. There is hardly a disease which anatomically and clinically presents such multiplicity and variability in its course as pulmonary tuberculosis. Aside from acute forms which terminate fatally in a few weeks, we observe others which spread slowly in the course of months and years, relapse frequently, come to a standstill, and pass with or without mixed infection. The reasons are largely obscure why in one case tuberculosis runs a rapid course, and in other cases advances chronically and slowly, extending through years and even decades; aside from individual resist- ance and disposition, accidents (erosion of vessels) and weakening influences obviously play a prominent part. A special influence unquestionably belongs to the age of the patient; in children and young persons tuberculosis has a decided tendency to run a rapid course, in older and senile patients we often observe a certain benignancy of the process, a slower prog- ress, a diminished destructive tendency, and a greater disposition to fibrous and productive inflammations. While a varying virulence of the germs of infection has thus far not been exactly proven, an important role is played by hereditary tendency, age, external noxse (quality of the air, debilitating influences, etc.), and social conditions (occupation, nutrition, alcohol- ism) in the course of tuberculosis. Tuberculous phthisis, so called, is ordinarily a process compli-

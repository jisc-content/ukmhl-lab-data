96 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. those of the extremities, the blood escapes into the surrounding tissue, which is displaced; the injured point is covered with a mass of blood like a tumor, which pulsates, becomes gradually encapsulated, and is known as a false aneurism (aneurysma spurium). Thrombosis of the Arteries. This occurs either autochthonously in consequence of disease of the wall (sclerosis, endarteritis) or of other lesions of the vessel wall, such as trauma and ligation, or else by emboli coming from a distance. Such embolic thrombosis is frequently traceable to the right heart or the peripheral veins derived from the main trunks and branches of the pulmonary ar- tery, or to the left heart and the trunks of the larger arteries (aorta) in the distribution of the peripheral arteries of the body. As the result of the embolic occlusion of the vessels we frequently observe in the lung hemorrhagic infarc- tions of variable size; in the distribution of the pe- ripheral arteries of the body with corresponding col- lateral circulation merely temporary ischaemia; a benign embolus in such a case acts like a ligature of the vessel. In organs with so-called terminal arteries (spleen and kidneys) the result is coagulation necro- sis and embolic infarctions; in the distribution of the basal arteries of the brain, ischaemic softening. When the emboli are infectious, filled with septic germs—for instance, when they are derived from a septic tlirombo-phlebitis or mycotic endocarditis— they cause at the points where they are arrested, with or without circulatory disturbance, septic puru-

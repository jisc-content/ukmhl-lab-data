132 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. a long time, now ancl then only after decades. The stenosis of the bronchi, especially those devoid of cartilage, may also be due to pressure (compression of the lung by a pleuritic exudate or by hydrothorax), to the effect of an aortic aneurism or of lymphatic glands which have become abnormally enlarged by carcinomatous, sarcomatous, or tuberculous disease. Dilatation of the Bronchi (Bronchiectasis). (Plate 22.) The dilatation of the bronchi is either diffuse, when the bronchial tube is found uniformly dilated for con- siderable distances, i.e., cylindrical bronchiectasis; or the dilatations are more circumscribed, fusiform, sacculated, or rosary-like, with intervening constric- tions. True bronchiectasis is invested with a mucous membrane having normal ciliated epithelium; false bronchiectasis is the condition in which the spaces connected with the lumen of the bronchi are only partly covered with ciliated mucous membrane, while another portion corresponds to real cavities resulting from necrotic disintegration of the pulmonary paren- chyma. The causes of bronchiectasis are manifold and often hard to determine from the anatomical find- ings. In general, chronic changes in the walls with alteration of the vital qualities (elasticity and con- tractile, atrophy of the muscular coat) following upon chronic inflammatory processes plaj^ the prin- cipal role (nutritive disturbances); next in order are mechanical influences, the air pressure being greatly increased at frequent intervals; finally dilatation may be due to contraction and condensation of the sur-

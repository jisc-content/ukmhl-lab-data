Explanation of Plate 52. Fatty and Engorged Liver in Chronic Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Fig. a.—The liver is enlarged, of a pale orange-red color, and diminished consistence. The contained blood is very small in amount. Light scraping produces a vis- cid juice with fatty lustre. The acinous marking is very distinct; the centre of the acini is light brown, the mar- ginal portions are pale yellowish in color. The micro- scopical appearance is that of chronic fatty infiltration, with ectasia of the capillaries in the centre of the acini, i.e., the organ is the anaemic engorged liver with fatty infiltration, which is observed with particular frequency in connection with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient (No. 633, 1894), aged twenty-five years, had succumbed to chronic and recurrent tuberculosis of the lungs with pneumothorax and ulcerating intestinal tuberculosis. Fatty Infiltrated Nutmeg Liver. Chronic En- gorgement of the Liver in Heart Disease. Fig. b.—The liver is somewhat reduced in size and harder to cut than the normal organ. The cut surface shows the nutmeg marking very clearly and is decidedly icteric. The centres of the lobules are dark brown, the marginal portions dull yellowish in color. The contained blood is diminished in amount, probably by reason of prolonged stay in bed of the patient. The patient, a woman aged fifty-four years (No. 47, 1895), had suffered from chronic aortic sclerosis, exten- sion of the inflammatory process to the aortic valves, with consequent insufficiency and stenosis. 52

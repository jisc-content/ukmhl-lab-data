In- terstitial emphysema develops as a terminal condition in consequence of intense dyspnoea, most easily in the delicate lungs of children, especially in diphtheria, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Atelectasis. By the term atelectasis is understood a defective expansion of the pulmonary parenchyma; it may be found spread diffusely over both lungs (foetal atelec- tasis) or confined to single lobes or lobules. Pulmonary tissue thus changed is sunken, discol- ored bluish-red or ashy gray, airless, hard to cut, and resembles splenic tissue; atelectatic portions of the lung can be inflated from the bronchi, while this is not possible with the inflammatorily infiltrated and airless lung. The following forms are distinguished: Foetal or congenital atelectasis. This affects the entire lung, and total atelectasis of the newly born is a sure sign that the child did not breathe after birth, i.e., that it was dead-born. In inanition with defec- tive function of the respiratory mechanism we find in- flated light red portions side by side with atelectatic segments. Acquired atelectasis results from various causes. Pressure from without acting upon the lung produces compression atelectasis, e.g., when fluid or air accu- mulates in the pleural cavity (hydro-pyo-pneumo- tliorax). In cases of moderate accumulations of exu- date only the inferior and posterior portions of the lung become airless; when large amounts of fluid are

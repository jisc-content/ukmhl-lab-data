Slighter grades of infil- tration with gritty particles which are associated with anthracosis are frequent and can be determined ex- actly only by chemical analysis of the dry substance. Inflammation of the Lymphatic Glands. Ly m phadenitis. We distinguish acute and chronic forms of lymph- adenitis, purulent and tuberculous inflammations. In acute inflammation the glands appear more or less enlarged, injected, juicy, full of blood, and of a medullary consistence. The hyperplastic swelling is followed either by resolution or in the case of more intense processes by purulent degeneration of the gland tissue, the formation of an abscess. The lat- ter again may heal by inspissation and absorption, or it may involve neighboring structures or the skin and break, or it may cause larger abscesses, purulent inflammation of the cellular tissue surrounding it. Inspissation and caseation may also end in calcifica- tion, and many partial or diffuse calcifications of in- ternal lymphatic glands accidentally discovered at an autopsy should be interpreted as the residues of such purulent processes. Chronic lymphadenitis usually develops slowly; the enlarged lymphatic glands are hard and the pa- renchyma shows a considerable increase of the retic- ulum with corresponding loss and atrophy of the

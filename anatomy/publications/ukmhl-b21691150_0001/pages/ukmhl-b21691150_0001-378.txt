Diseases of the Pancreas. In the pancreas hemorrhages are now and then ob- served ; they result either from a general hemorrhagic diathesis or else occur idiopathically and spontane- ously with partial obstruction of the gland; rarely the hemorrhages are of traumatic or inflammatory origin. Hemorrhages occur also secondarily in con- nection with necrosis of isolated segments of the gland and of the fatty tissue; in the latter case there may be a formation of hsematomata and hemorrhagic cysts, followed by the effusion of blood into the abdominal cavity. Inflammations of the pancreas are rare; occasion- ally we find an acute purulent pancreatitis. This is either limited to a portion of the gland or the whole of the latter is infiltrated with pus; multiple ab- scesses may develop from the inflammation, also ne- crosis of some portions and secondary peritonitis. Diffuse purulent inflammation springs sometimes from the efferent ducts (centrifugally) by the immi- gration of pathogenic germs from the intestine; be- sides, a metastatic hsematogenous inflammation is possible. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis may develop from pri- mary hemorrhages or from a parenchymatous inflam- mation of the gland tissue. Secondarily various forms of pancreatitis result from the extension of the inflammatory process from

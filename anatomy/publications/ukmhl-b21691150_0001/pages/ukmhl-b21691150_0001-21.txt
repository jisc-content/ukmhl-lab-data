Explanation of Plate 2b. 3 Cor Adiposum, Adipositas Cordis. Fatty infiltration of the subepicardial connective tissue, extending into the external layers of the heart muscle. The heart is covered with a mantle of fat through which the muscle gleams only here and there with a reddish tint. This connective-tissue proliferation containing fat is found to be most marked at the base of the heart and over the right ventricle. The limit toward the muscle is indistinct.

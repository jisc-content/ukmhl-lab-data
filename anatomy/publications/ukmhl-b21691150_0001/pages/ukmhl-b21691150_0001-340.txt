Healing of the ulcera- tive defects is extremely rare, here and there we may find a secondary cicatricial stenosis. Besides the localized multiple and focal peritoneal tuberculosis there is frequently a diffuse tuberculosis of the peri- toneum, with or without adhesion and agglutination of the different layers, and with or without effusion of a fluid or coagulated exudate. Secondary cheesy tuberculosis of the mesenteric and retroperitoneal glands is often observed. Corre- sponding to the generally slow progress of the de- structive process, perforation and perforation peri- tonitis are rather rare (about five per cent) in intestinal tuberculosis. Typhoid Fever. (Plate 46.) The result of typhoid infection is a diffuse inflam- mation of the mucous membrane, together with a hyperplastic and necrosing inflammation of the lym- phoid follicles of the lower ileum; frequently (about one-half of all cases) the solitary follicles of the adjoining colon are also involved (ileo-colonic form). At the same time a very similar inflammatory hyper- plasia occurs in the mesenteric glands and in the spleen. In the first stage (hyperplastic infiltration) we ob- serve, along with diffuse catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membrane, great swelling and enlarge- ment of the solitary follicles and of Peyerâ€™s patches; the former may reach the size of a hempseed or pea, the latter constitute flat, plane, reddened, elevated

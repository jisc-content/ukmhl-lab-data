Explanation of Plate 47. Ulcerative and Perforating Appendicitis. Fig. a.—In the peripheral portion of the appendix vermiformis are several perforations caused by faecal concretions. The perforation was followed by a puru- lent retroperitoneal paratyphlitis and the formation of a large abscess which, like a psoas abscess, burrowed from the lower margin of the right kidney under Poupart’s ligament and into the true pelvis. The course was sub- acute. Fatal issue with symptoms of exhaustion. The patient, a woman aged eighteen years (No. 287, 1895), was found at the autopsy to be greatly emaciated and extremely anaemic. (Further details about this case will be found in the dissertation by Franz Deutschlander: “ Ueber Appendi- citis perforativa mit sekundarer eiteriger retroperitonealer Paratyphlitis,” Munich, 1895.) Fecal Concretions from the Vermiform Appendix. (Seven cases.) Fig. b.—Three separate concretions, from the size of a bean to that of a cherry (in the centre of the figure), and four groups of such at the periphery. The concre- tions differ considerably in color and bulk; on section (to the right below) they are distinctly laminated. All of these concretions from seven cases gave rise to ulcerating necrotic appendicitis and fatal perforation peritonitis. The patients (three men, four women) were between twelve and thirty-eight years old; the average age was twenty-two years. 47

78 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. and finally diffuse dilatation of the ventricles. Clin- ically the picture presented is that of angina pectoris or stenocardia (attacks of cardiac dyspnoea, arrhyth- mia, and violent pain). Endocarditis. (Inflammation of the Endocardium.) This affection is localized by preference on the valves (valvular endocarditis), more rarely on the parietal investment of the chambers of the heart (pa- rietal endocarditis). There are numerous forms: acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent endocarditis. From an etio- logical point of view we distinguish idiopathic pri- mary endocarditis from the secondary form, which develops either as infectious and metastatic or by continuity from the surrounding structures (for in- stance, extending from the intima of the aorta to the aortic valves). Finally we differentiate benign, non- infectious forms from the infectious, the chief repre- sentative of which is the septico-mycotic, ulcerative endocarditis. According to the products we distin- guish productive and deforming inflammations, i.e., endocarditis verrucosa, fibrosa, calculosa, and re- trahens; also the destructive septic form, malignant or diphtheroid endocarditis, with various mixed and transitional forms. In the following remarks we con- fine ourselves to the description of the most impor- tant forms.

93 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. at tlie point of greatest dilatation, extreme thinning of the wall, irregular defects of the media and intima, so that the wall consists largely only of the slightly thickened adventitia, whose resistance to the blood pressure seems to be reinforced by deposits of lami- nated parietal thrombi. The fundamental condition of this important change in form of the artery is evidently arteriosclerosis which causes weakening and partial atrophy of the media. Next to senile and presenile endarteritis it is probably postsyphilitic endarteritis (endarteritis sclero-gum- mosa), and in a few cases also traumatic influences, that cause a development of aneurisms. Sudden in- crease of the blood pressure and great overburdening of the vessel wall, resulting from excessive muscular labor, may act in some cases as an exciting cause. That mechanical influences favor the development of an aneurism is proved by the frequency of its occur- rence on the popliteal artery, in which a local arteritis due to the continually alternating extension and flex- ion produces the dilatation. In favor of the view, which has been disputed by many, that chronic in- flammation of the intima with secondary mesarteritis may cause the development of an aneurismal dilata- tion independent of other factors, we may cite an experience from comparative pathology. In horses in which aneurisms of the aorta and other arteries resulting from sclerosis of the vessel wall practically never occur, we find on the main trunks of the mesen- teric arteries (arteria mesenterica anterior) very fre- quently—in more than ninety per cent of all horses —aneurisms whose origin must unquestionably be ascribed to a zob-parasitical and verminous endarteri-

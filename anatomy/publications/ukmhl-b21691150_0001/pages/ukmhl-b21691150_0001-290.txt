Finally certain constitutional, debilitating influences—anaemia, diabetes, chronic congestive disturbances, cancerous cachexia, psychi- cal depression, imprisonment, and similar factors— have a predisposing effect or favor the rapid further spread of older latent foci (Plate 28, Fig. a). Secondary tuberculosis of the lungs is found much more rarely, now and then in children when the in- fectious process extends toward the root of the lungs from the primarily affected peribronchial or medi- astinal lymphatic glands, as it were in an inverse direction; or the secondary pulmonary tuberculosis is of hsematogenous and metastatic origin, occurring as a local phenomenon of a general miliary tubercu- losis which has arisen by way of auto-infection from any older latent focus and in which the tuberculous virus has invaded the body in any manner, usually cryptogenic. Acute and Subacute Miliary Tuberculosis of the Lung. (Plate 28, Fig. b.) Acute miliary tuberculosis of the lung represents the typical picture of infectious bacillary tuberculosis and is characterized by the progressive new formation of multiple, miliary, infectious granulomata which occur in the stroma of the tissue. There is no mixed infection, and of the accessory processes which i)lajr so important a part in the more slowly progressive, inflammatory forms of tuberculosis we encounter only acute diffuse desquamative pneumonia and bronchitis.

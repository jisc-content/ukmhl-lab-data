ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 194 (violent motion), the marginal adhesions and agglu- tinations give way and secondary perforation ensues from some part of the margin (Fig. 17). In rare cases adhesion may take place to the anterior ab- dominal wall, to the liver, spleen, transverse colon, and duodenum (with formation of a bimucous fistula when perforation occurs into an adjoining segment of the intestine). The causes of gastric ulcer are not completely elu- cidated. Beside local circulatory disturbances (hem- orrhages, hemorrhagic erosions, ischaemia, and em- boli) which favor partial self-digestion and furnish to the gastric juice, as it were, the first point of attack, some part is played by lesions of the mucous mem- brane of the organ (thermic and toxic influences, excessively hot food, whiskey, coarse indigestible aliment, and mechanical factors such as tight lacing). Anomalies in the composition of the blood, chloro- sis and anaemia among constitutional factors, un- doubtedly favor the extension of the ulcer and prevent its healing. Badly nourished persons are more fre- quently attacked; in women round gastric ulcer is three times as common as in men; relapses are often observed. The cicatrices predispose to the develop- ment of carcinoma. When the ulcers and cicatrices are located at the pylorus they cause stenosis of the latter and secondary gastrectasia. Cicatricial contraction in the middle of the stomach gives rise to hour-glass deformity, the organ being divided iuto two parts communicating by a narrow opening.

DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 149 fluent lobular pueumonia). The pleura as a rule is not involved or exhibits at most the initial stages of a fibrinous inflammation. The exudation is mainly purulent, sometimes there are also small quantities of fibrin and alveolar epithelia in varying numbers in the alveoli of the diseased parts. The pathological features are less characteristic and somewhat obliterated in the lower lobes when the process is associated with hypostasis and oedema (asthenic marasmic pneumonia); frequently there are also present lobular atelectases the result of occlusion of the bronchi. In the development of the disease various factors co-operateâ€”imperfect expectoration of the bronchial secretion and its gravitation toward the deeper portions of the lung, some weakness of the respiratory mechanism, and reduced cardiac activity. This form of pneumonia therefore occurs by prefer- ence in children, in the aged, and in marasmic pa- tients, particularly accompanying diphtheria, scarla- tina, measles, whooping-cough, typhoid fever, etc. The cause of the infection is chiefly the diplococcus of pneumonia, in about one-half of the cases alone, in the other half associated with other micro-orga- nisms (bacterium coli, staphylococcus pyogenes au- reus, or streptococci). The process terminates either in recovery or in death, in which latter case purulent disintegration (abscess formation) or gangrene repre- sent unfavorable complications. In rare cases the exudation is slowly absorbed or the process ends in induration (interstitial fibrous lobular pneumonia), with thickening of the septa and of the interlobular trabeculae. Closely related to the above-described form is in-

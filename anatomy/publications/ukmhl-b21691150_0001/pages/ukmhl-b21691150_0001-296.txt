While cavities in their initial stages can probably be obliterated by way of cicatricial con- traction, those of the size of a pea and above possess all the conditions for a progressive increase. In the living patient, cavities inaccessible to physi- cal diagnosis by reason of their location or smallness, may possibly be recognized by the bacilli contained in the sputum. The formation of multiple small cav- ities (Plate 30) in the later and terminal stages of tuberculosis, usually associated with multiple cheesy lobular pneumonia, is markedly favored by accidental mixed infection with pyogenic organisms, so that these rapidly developing and often purulent cavities belong at least in part among the pulmonary ab- scesses. They are frequently found in considerable numbers scattered through diseased tuberculous lung tissue, and when subpleural in their location the}' cause, owing to the rapidity of their formation, not rarely a terminal pyo-pneumothorax. When multiple abscesses form, which may also result from the pyo- genic effect of the toxins produced by the tubercle bacilli, the pulmonary tissue on the cut surface ap- pears perforated like a sponge (Plate 30), whose pores and interstices are filled with pus and products of disintegration. In all these inflammatory, fibrous, and cheesy proc- esses we usually find scattered between and along- side the diseased portions of the lung acute and sub- acute miliary tubercles, in like manner as upon the covering pleura miliary tubercles and secondary tuberculous inflammations are very frequently met with. Of course the above-described cheesy and necrotic

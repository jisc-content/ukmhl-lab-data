SPLEEN. 105 frequently in this organ. In general we distinguish two forms: (1) Acute miliary tuberculosis of the spleen as a local phenomenon of general miliary tuberculosis. In this form the organ is considerably enlarged, soft, moderately filled with blood, and dark brown in color; the parenchyma is sprinkled with exceedingly numerous, barely visible nodules. The latter are gray and translucent, often yellowish, opaque in the centre, and differ especially by this last-named peculiarity from the Malpighian corpus- cles, which they otherwise greatly resemble. (2) The tuberous, more subacute or chronic form containing tuberculous foci, which is most frequent in children (Plate 16, Fig. b). The lesions often appear isolated as solitary tubercles in the form of yellowish cheesy patches ranging in size from that of a hempseed to that of a pea or a cherry; their marginal zone is more gray and gelatinous and slightly-injected; in many instances the larger patches result from the coales- cence of several neighboring nodules, i. e., agglom- erated tubercles. Syphilomata (gummata) of the spleen, m the form of irregular deposits of a yellowish color and cheesy consistence, are less common. Neoplasms of the spleen are also rare; now and then carcinomatous or sarcomatous nodules of meta- static origin are found. Among the degenerative processes which are local- ized by preference in the spleen, amyloid degenera- tion occupies the first rank. In both forms, the dif- fuse and that confined to the Malpighian corpuscles, the spleen is markedly enlarged; besides, in the for- mer variety the organ is firm, light red or dark red

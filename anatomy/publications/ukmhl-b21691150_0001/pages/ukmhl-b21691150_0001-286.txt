ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 152 the alveolar epithelia; the coagulated masses of exu- date becoming peptonized and undergoing fatty de- generation before absorption. The exudate is grad- ually replaced with air and at the end of the third week the lung again appears capable of function. Only the total or partial adhesion of the layers of the pleura (adhesive pleurisy), which results from the acute exudative, and generally sero-fibrinous pleu- risy, forms a permanent residue of the pleuro-pneu- monia from which the patient has recovered. Many forms of pneumonia present from the start a perni- cious, more septic character when streptococci and staphylococci are active in the production of the dis- ease, or the cases become malignant in their course by secondary mixed infection. In such instances we find not rarely at the autopsy as incidental complications purulent pleurisy, endocarditis and pericarditis, men- ingitis, and icterus (bilious pneumonia). A rare ter- mination is in induration and carnification, i. e., the inflammatory infiltrated stroma changes into a tissue at first cellular and later fibrous; the pulmonary alve- oli appear filled with vascularized, bud-like vegeta- tions which spring from the alveolar framework and take the place of the fibrinous masses of exudate by way of substitution. Besides idiopathic croupous pneumonia we fre- quently observe secondary and accidental croupous inflammation of the lung, in which numerous adhe- sions can be recognized, especially in debilitated, anaemic, and aged persons; instead of the firm rigid hepatization only splenization develops, by reason of a defective fibrinous exudation.

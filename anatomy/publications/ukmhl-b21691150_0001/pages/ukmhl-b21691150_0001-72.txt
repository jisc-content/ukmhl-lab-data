Explanation of Plate 20. Ulcerative Tuberculosis of the Larynx with Necrosis of the Cricoid Cartilage. Iu the left posterior wall of the larynx is a large ulcerated defect; in the depth of the excavated opening, which is almost as large as a cherry, we observe at the left side a detached cheesy and calcareous sequestrum; the interior wall of the cavity has a corroded aspect and is covered with a purulent discolored secretion. The mucosa at the entrance of the larynx, especially about the aryepiglottic folds, is greatly swollen and the lumen of the aditus is considerably narrowed in conse- quence. The rest of the mucous membrane of the larynx is moderately thickened, smooth, and pale in color. During life the symptom complex was so peculiar that cancer of the larynx was suspected for some time. Directly beneath the larynx in the first part of the trachea is a gaping, slit-like loss of substance caused by tracheotomy. Besides the serious ulcerative and necrotic affection of the larynx there were found in the patient, who was forty-seven years old, chronic pulmonary tuberculosis and ulcerating tuberculosis of the colon. 20

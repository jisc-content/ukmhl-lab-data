178 ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMV. cheeks, secondary periostitis, and necrosis of the bones may be superadded. Toxic stomatitis, due to mercurial poisoning (medicamentous or in certain occupations, especially the manufacture of mirrors), presents appearances similar to scurvy. Allied changes result from chronic lead and phosphorus poisoning. Syphilis of the oral cavity may occur in the form of the primary lesion as a result of direct or indirect infection. More commonly, as the result of the gen- eral infection, we find in the oral cavity syphilitic papules or patches in the form of roundish, reddened, and slightly prominent lesions; subsequently these efflorescences present a milky opacity with an almost nacreous lustre and sometimes intense reddening. Owing to the proliferation of the papillae and follicles, the surface is uneven. From the confluence of such papules extensive ulcers may result, at the angles of the mouth in the form of irregular fissures, so-called rhagades. The ulcerative processes are sometimes due to the breaking down of gummy formations, es- pecially upon the tongue. Ulcers on the hard palate may be connected with syphilitic periostitis or osti- tis ; in that event deep-seated caries and necrosis of the bone, perforation, and communication with the nasal cavity (cleft palate) are found as complications. Smooth atrophy of the base of the tongue indicates former syphilis which has run its course. Gangrene of the cheek (noma, water canker) devel- ops now and then apparently spontaneously in very cachectic children suffering from grave infections (typhoid fever, scarlatina, measles, tuberculosis) and living under unfavorable hygienic conditions.

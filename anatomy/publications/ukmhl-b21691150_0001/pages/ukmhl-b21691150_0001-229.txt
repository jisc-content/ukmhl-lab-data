CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. 95 arteritis, or occurring without demonstrable cause (possibly traumata?). Purely degenerative processes are found in the arterial walls as follows: 1. Fatty degeneration, especially in the smaller arborizations of the cerebral arteries and also in the connective-tissue cells of the intima. 2. Calcareous degeneration of the media, in the me- dium-sized and small arteries of the extremities; its characteristic feature is the circular calcareous de- posit which corresponds to the course of the circular muscles; this form is often included with inflamma- tory sclerosis and mistaken for it. 3. Amyloid degeneration, occurring chiefly in the minute arteries of the abdominal organs—the kid- neys, spleen, liver, and intestine—and associated with amyloid degeneration of the parenchyma of the organs named. Injuries op the Arteries. Small wounds of the arteries heal, without material thrombosis and without obliteration of the lumen, by union and adhesion of the wound margins, the blood circulation remaining undisturbed. After complete division of arteries (amputations), under the favoring influence of retraction and contraction of the severed vessel or the ligature, thrombosis occurs and at first occludes the lumen as far as the nearest proximal branches; soon after the thrombus is replaced, by way of substitution, by young connective tissue which springs mainly from the intima (so-called organiza- tion of the thrombus). In lateral injuries of the arterial trunks, especially

DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN'S. 147 The most dangerous effect upon the lung is evi- dently produced by the dust of the so-called Thomas slag, which is extremely irritating to the pulmonary tissue and tends especially to cause typical, infec- tious, croupous pneumonia. A similar effect, though less serious, is produced by the habitual inhalation of vegetable dust by workers in tobacco, cotton, wooden ware, hemp, flax, etc. All these substances, particularly if mixed with pathogenic germs, readily cause bronchitis and in- flammatory states in the lung, so-called accessory processes, which often occur after the inhalation of mineral and metallic dust, when they assume the form of catarrhal and croupous pneumonia and espe- cially accessory tuberculosis. The fact that with the characteristic soot or carbon lung tuberculosis is com- paratively rarely met with is ascribed by some authors to the specific (antibacterial?) effect of coal; at all events the indurative and productive processes which occur in many conioses of the lung occlude numerous lymph and blood channels that otherwise would favor the spread and metastasis of the tuberculous virus. On the other hand, the spread and progress of originally latent and localized tuberculous processes in the lung are favored by the inhalation of the vari- ous kinds of dust, while the healing and arrest of tuberculous processes are retarded.

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 224 local tuberculosis of tlie intestinal mucosa or of the mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphatic glands (Plate 49). It is usually spread more or less uni- formly over the entire peritoneum, the slightly red- dened serosa being covered with numerous miliary tubercles; when the course is less rapid (subacute or subchronic tuberculosis) the nodules may reach the size of a hempseed or pea. 2. As localized focal miliary tuberculosis, fre- quently associated with subacute or chronic fibrous peritonitis, starting from older tuberculous ulcers of the intestinal mucosa. Particularly in the serosa of the lower ileum and the adjoining colon we observe upon the convex side of the slightly contracted bowel groups of miliary nodules, each group corresponding to an ulcer on the mucous surface of the intestine, he., aggregated recurrent miliary tuberculosis result- ing from regional infection (Plate 48). 3. Tuberculous peritonitis may resemble tubercu- lous pleurisy; we distinguish an acute or subacute exudative form, when the exudate is usually hemor- rhagic, more rarely sero-fibrinous or purulent; be- sides, numerous miliary tubercles like grains of sand are scattered through the serosa. Then there is a chronic productive and adhesive tuberculous perito- nitis with the formation of larger nodules (Plate 50), diffuse infiltration especially of the great omentum (omentitis tuberculosa), which is shortened, fibrous, thickened, hard as a board, and sprinkled with irreg- ular cheesy foci. Tuberculosis of the peritoneum, with or without inflammation, is found in about five per cent of all cases of fatal tuberculosis; very rarely is it primary,

ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 104 color, sharply demarcated from the surrounding tis- sue; they are wedge-shaped, the base being subperi- toneal, the point directed toward the hilus of the spleen; the occluded vessel is to be looked for in the region of the point. The benign embolic infarctions are more rarely hemorrhagic in quality and differ from the surrounding tissue by their dark brownish- red color, greater firmness, and a certain dryness. In the further course there is a gradual contraction of the infarctions, a cicatricial retraction of the affected part, and finally we find as the residues of the arterial occlusion only whitish fibrous cicatrices which extend to a varying depth into the parenchyma of the spleen and sometimes include orange-colored, cheesy, and calcareous remains of the cicatrized tissue. Such be- nign infarctions occur especially with subacute and chronic endocarditis of the valves of the left heart and with ulcerative and thrombotic endaortitis. When the emboli are of infectious origin, e.g., in septic mycotic endocarditis, there is besides the local ischaemia and hemorrhage an early purulent disinte- gration ; the yellowish-white purulent foci with their red areola are visible through the capsule of the spleen. The metastatic abscesses range in size from a pinâ€™s head to a walnut and larger; the entire organ is considerably swollen; a secondary purulent peri- splenitis and peritonitis may be superadded. Tuberculosis of the Spleen. Aside from tuberculous disease of the capsule of the spleen which forms part of tuberculosis of the peritoneum, tuberculous processes are found rather

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 148 Inflammation of the Lung (Pneumonia). Catarrhal Pneumonia. Lobular Pneumonia, Broncho-Pneumonia. Catarrhal pneumonia progresses downward, centri- fugally, since the inflammatory process extends from the mucous membrane of the smaller bronchi (capil- lary bronchitis) to the corresponding lobules of the lung. The inflammation attacks by preference the inferior and posterior segments of the lung; in the aerated, light-red tissue we observe scattered lobular foci which are sharply demarcated from the surround- ing structures by their dark bluish-red color, their firm and spleen-like consistence. The cut surface is not smooth but marked by flat prominences, since the infiltrated lobules, which contain no air or only traces of it, are apt to project and differ from the surround- ing tissue by their color, at first darker, then lighter, and the greater mass of blood they contain. On scraping the cut surface while slight pressure is ex- erted upon the tissue, plugs of creamy pus exude from the divided finer bronchi. In the further course we notice on the cut surface or through the pleura that the central portions of the affected lobules in partic- ular are somewhat lighter colored, sometimes speckled with grayish-yellow spots, corresponding to the com- mencing purulent disintegration which may advance to the formation of abscesses. When the process is more extensive the lobular foci may coalesce so that at last the greater portion of a lobe or the entire lobe shows splenization (con-

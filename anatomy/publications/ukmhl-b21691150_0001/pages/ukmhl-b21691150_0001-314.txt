ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 180 DISEASES OF THE PHARYNX. Inflammatory processes are very frequent upon the pharyngeal mucosa. Acute catarrhal pharyngitis (angina catarrhalis) develops idiopathically or secondarily, especially with scarlatina, measles, and variola. The mucous membrane is reddened, swollen, and covered with a tough mucous or muco-purulent deposit, particularly upon the soft palate and the enlarged tonsils; the follicles are usually enlarged (lacunar tonsillitis). When the purulent secretion is more abundant, the crypts of the tonsils are filled with masses of pus which exude spontaneously over the surface or are evacuated by pressure. The pathogenic fungi usually found are staphylococci or streptococci. In chronic pharyngitis, besides the diffuse thicken- ing of the mucous membrane, the follicles are greatly swollen (pharyngitis granulosa); the palatal tonsils are usually enlarged, and the crypts filled with yel- lowish puriform masses and plugs. The enlarged tonsils in chronic inflammation appear firm, discol- ored to a more or less slaty gray, and contain thick- ened, mortar-like or calcified plugs. The tonsils by reason of their structure (deep indentations of the mucous membrane between the follicles, physiologi- cal defects of the epithelial investment, with the con- tinual emigration of white blood corpuscles, which appear in the oral secretion as so-called mucous cor- puscles) are evidently very prone to take up infectious matters, and, like a sponge, to suck up pathogenic germs and thus fix objects in transit.

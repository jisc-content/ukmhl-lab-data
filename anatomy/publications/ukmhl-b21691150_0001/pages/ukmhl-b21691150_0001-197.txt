CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. G3 two layers of the pericardium more or less uniformly, the superficial strata of the coagulated fibrinous exu- date present, by reason of the continuous contact and friction caused by the heartâ€™s action, a honeycomb appearance, a partly reticulated, partly villous ar- rangement (shaggy heart, cor villosum); while the deeper strata of the exudate soon give evidence of be- ginning organization, i.e., an increased deposition of leucocytes, and the development of newly formed blood-vessels which sprout without cessation from the vessels of the inflamed serosa. In the above-described serodibrinous inflammation the exudate is very frequently bloody (pericarditis hsemorrhagica), in which case the dilated pericardium often contains considerable quantities of a sero-san- guinolent fluid (as much as one to one and a half litres [quarts]) of a blackisli-brown color. Hemorrhagic pericarditis, which has a very un- favorable prognosis, runs an acute or subacute course, and is met with especially in drinkers (hence in men it is four times more frequent than in women and oc- curs oftenest between the fortieth and sixtieth year of life), in chronic nephritis, in cardiac hypertrophy (plethora), in cachectic and debilitated subjects affected with tuberculosis (two-thirds of all cases) or cancer. In exudative cellulo-fibrinous pericarditis the af- fected layers of the pericardium present about the conditions of wound surfaces, that is to say, the em- bryonal granulation tissue interspersed with masses of fibrin gradually develops into mature connective tissue. All stages of this form may terminate in re- covery, whose results may be observed at autopsies

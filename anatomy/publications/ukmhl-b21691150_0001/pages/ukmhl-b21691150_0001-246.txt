112 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Neoplasms of the Lymphatic Glands. 0 As primary neoplasms we find lymphomata and sarcomata; the former are often with difficulty distin- guished from simple hyperplasia (in leukaemia). Malignant lymphomata is the term applied to tumors characterized by rapid growth and a certain malignancy; in their clinical course they belong to the lympho-sarcomata. Chronic hyperplasia of the lymphatic glands with- out associated leuksemic disease of the blood is also largely described as pseudo-leukaemia (Hodgkinâ€™s disease), or when accompanied by grave anaemia as anaemia lymphatica; the relation of this affection to splenic anaemia is still rather obscure. Besides round-celled lympho-sarcoma, primary fibro-sarcoma and spindle-celled sarcoma are occa- sionally observed. Among the secondary and metastatic new forma- tions of the lymphatic glands carcinoma occupies the first place. In cancerous disease of peripheral or- gans, cellular elements are almost regularly trans- ported by way of the lymph channels into the nearest lymphatic glands, where they lodge and increase. The entire process is to be regarded as a kind of auto-transplantation, in which infectious germs may jiossibly play a part but are not absolutely essential. If we were to concede their activity from a theoretical point of view, they could be transported only within the cells, since metastatic carcinomatous disease of the lymphatic glands, like metastatic disease of other organs (lungs, liver, etc.), always permits the recog-

DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS. 245 neighboring organs, e.g., in carcinoma of the duo- denum or stomach. In chronic interstitial pancreatitis the gland ap- pears enlarged and firm, in later stages contracted and board-like in consistence; as in hepatic cirrhosis we find the framework increased and the glandular substance atrophic. Hypertrophic induration devel- ops sometimes in connection with chronic congestion. A special form of atrophic induration results from occlusion of the efferent channel. Among the neoplasms of the pancreas the first place belongs to carcinoma, which occurs primarily and secondarily. Secondary carcinosis frequently results from direct extension of a primary cancer of the duodenum. The cancer is often confined to the head of the gland. In the majority of cases stenosis of the ductus choledochus and icterus follow. Sarcoma is very rare, and more frequently second- ary than primary. Tuberculosis of the pancreas is also rare; it occurs either as miliary tuberculosis in general miliary tuber- culosis or now and then by extension from the sur- rounding structures, particularly from tuberculous retroperitoneal lymphatic glands. Cysts of the pancreas likewise are rare; they are usually retention cysts (ranula pancreatica), or else the cysts develop) in connection with interstitial pan- creatitis. Atrophy of the pancreas is observed occasionally in old and marasmic subjects, more frequently in diabetes mellitus. In inflammatory atrophy the gland is flaccid, somewhat darkened, and the lobules are diminished in size and traversed by connective-

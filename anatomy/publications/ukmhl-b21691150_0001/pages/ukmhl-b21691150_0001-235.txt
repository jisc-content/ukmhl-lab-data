SPLEEN. 101 dilated venous branches of the uterus, spleen, peri- toneum, and the lower extremities. DISEASES OF THE SPLEEN. The capsule of the spleen takes part in numerous affections of the peritoneum, especially inflammatory processesâ€”fibrinous, purulent, and adhesive peri- splenitis. Adhesions of the capsule to the surround- ing organs (diaphragm, omentum) are observed with particular frequency. Besides these have been found, usually associated with pathological processes of the splenic tissue, milky patches and nodular thickenings of the cap- sule, which are apt to be membranous or almost car- tilaginous in older subjects with chronic enlargement of the organ. Primary idiopathic diseases of the spleen are far more rare than secondary affections, which are often present in the form of swelling and inflammatory hyperplasia (engorgement of the spleen) with mamr infectious diseases (sepsis, typhoid fever, malaria, tuberculosis, and syphilis) and with circulatory dis- turbances (acute and chronic congestion). The weight of the normal slpeen varies between 140 and 160 gm. =5 and 5^ oz.; length, width, and thickness measure respectively 12, 7, and 3 cm. = 4|x2ixl|in. Acute inflammatory or infectious hyperplasia of the spleen (parenchymatous splenitis) is of haematogenous origin and is explained by the role played by this organ as a blood filter for organized and chemical noxae. Besides, the spleen takes up the detritus of

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 88 tima in consequence appears truly deformedâ€”endar- teritis deformans. Owing to the loss of elasticity and contractility with atrophy of the muscular coat, diffuse and circumscribed dilatations of the artery develop, i.e., ectasise and aneurisms. In the medium- sized and smaller arteries the parietal disease causes stenosis of the lumen. A special form of chronic endarteritis is that occur- ring at an earlier age (from thirty to forty or forty- five years), the gummous form due to syphilis. The intima of the aorta contains flat, garden-bed-like, spot- ted elevations of a grayish-white color which have no marked tendency to fatty degeneration and calcifica- tion. Postsyphilitic arteritis, which extends grad- ually from the adventitia to the intima and presents no tendency to fatty degeneration and calcification of the diseased parts, is also observed in a very char- acteristic form as a cellular infiltration of the cerebral arteries in persons of a comparatively early age (be- tween twenty-five and forty-five years) who had ac- quired syphilis some longer or shorter time previously and had apparently recovered. This form often ter- minates fatally by obliteration of the lumen of the vessel (endarteritis obliterans), followed by softening of the brain or apoplexy. The causes of arteriosclerosis which occurs in part as a senile disease are obviously manifold; aside from high living, alcoholism, syphilis, physical and mental overstrain, its development seems to be favored in some cases by a certain hereditary predisposition. The same injurious influences which give rise to these chronic hyperplastic and degenerative processes of the arterial wall are also largely active in producing

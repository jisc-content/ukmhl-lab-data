Explanation of Plate 45. Tuberculous Ulcers of the Small and Large Intestine. In the lower portion of the ileum, immediately above the valve of Bauhin, is a group of irregular ulcers with elevated red margins; in the latter and at the bottom of the ulcers yellowish miliary tubercles are visible. At the point where the caecum passes into the ascending colon are two larger, transverse ulcers similar to the othersâ€”with red, tumid, and partly undermined margins. At the bottom of the ulcers is a larger number of mil- iary, yellowish-white nodules. Upon the injected se- rosa of the thickened appendix vermiformis are groups of secondary miliary tubercles; each group corresponds to a tuberculous ulcer in the interior of the appendix. The ulcerating intestinal tuberculosis was a secondary condition, the primary lesion being a fatal chronic pul- monary tuberculosis in a patient aged twenty-six years (No. 74, 1895). 45

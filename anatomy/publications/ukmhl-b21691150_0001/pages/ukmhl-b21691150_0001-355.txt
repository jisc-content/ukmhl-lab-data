Tlie sequelae depend in the main upon the quantity of the trans- udation ; when the amount of fluid is large, we ob- serve abnormal elevation of the diaphragm with cor- responding diminution of the thoracic space and of the organs contained therein, especially the lungs. Peritonitis is extremely frequent in all grada- tions and formsâ€”circumscribed or diffuse; acute or chronic; benign, tending toward adhesion and re- covery, or as an infectious and purulent process with a usually fatal termination. As a rule peritonitis is a secondary process spring-. ing from the abdominal organs; very rarely is it idiopathic and cryptogenic. Adhesive peritonitis is not often diffuse but more commonly develops from dry fibrinous peritonitis. Such circumscribed forms of adhesive peritonitis are found particularly in the true pelvis (adhesive pelvic peritonitis), i.e., as perimetritis, peri-oophoritis, peri- hepatitis, perisplenitis, perityphlitis, or as adhesion of the gall bladder to the adjoining organs. Exudative peritonitis may be diffuse or encapsu- lated. In general the liquid masses of exudate have the tendency to collect in the deeper portions of the abdominal cavity, especially in the true pelvis, in the neighborhood of the kidneys, the liver, and the spleen. Besides the fibrinous and sero-fibrinous form, which has a more benign character, we distinguish a hemorrhagic, a purulent, a fibrino-purulent, an icho- rous, and a tuberculous peritonitis. The gross and the minute alterations in the forms of peritonitis here enumerated agree in general with the analogous processes in other serous membranes

Marasmic and autochthonous thrombosis occurs in the larger venous trunks of the lower extremities and in the sinuses of the dura mater. Any disease or process that causes heart failure either rapidly or slowly, such as acute and subacute febrile infectious diseases or those associated with cachexia and anaemia (carcinoma, chronic tuberculosis, chlorosis, the vari- ous anaemias, and the puerperium), greatly favors the development of marasmic thrombosis. The first be- ginning of a thrombus usually forms in the interior of the valves; the small thrombus, originally parie- tal, gradually becomes obstructive by enlarging in all directions. As the thrombus extends centrally from smaller into larger branches, it is a frequent oc- currence for it to project like a cone into another vessel and thus to act with reference to the blood current as a parietal thrombus, from which smal- ler or larger particles are easily detached and carried as emboli in a central direction; in this way embolism of the pulmonary arteries occasionally results. After a variable length of time venous thrombi undergo different metamorphoses; they may become organized by way of a productive endophlebitis, or we may observe central disintegration (puriform soft- ening), contraction, discoloration, now and then also calcification (formation of plileboliths). Such plile- boliths are sometimes discovered accidentally in the

Explanation, of Plate 28. Tuberculosis of the Apex of the Lung. Fig. a.—In the apex of the lung is a cherry-sized yellowish focus broken down in the centre; a hempseed- sized loss of substance in the centre communicates with a bronchus (initial stage of the formation of a cavity). Some distance farther downward is a similar yellowish cheesy focus of a circular form. In the surrounding aerated tissue, particularly to the left, are several slaty gray firm nodules, some of them in partial commencing caseation. Acute Miliary Tuberculosis of the Lung. Fig. b.—Scattered through the lung tissue, along with several larger, irregularly shaped cheesy foci, is a con- siderable number of miliary tubercles; toward the left and above similar nodules are visible through the pleura. The patient was a girl, aged four months (No. 379, 1895), whose mother had died of hasty consumption. Besides the acute and subacute pulmonary tuberculosis there were found miliary tuberculosis of the liver and spleen, which had started from a more advanced cheesy tuberculosis of the cervical, intrathoracic, and mesen- teric lymph glands. Incidental conditions found at the autopsy were caries of one petrous bone and furunculosis of the skin. 28

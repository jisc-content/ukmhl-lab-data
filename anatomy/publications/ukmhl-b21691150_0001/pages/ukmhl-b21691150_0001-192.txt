Explanation of Plate 60. Primary Cancer (Medullary Carcinoma) of the Liver. (One-half natural size.) In the right lobe of the liver, which is nearly twice its normal bulk, is a tumor the size of an adult head, of a yellowish-white and reddish color, and of a medullary consistence. The cut surface is somewhat uneven; a few portions of the tumor have become softened, and these masses are mixed with dark blood. The gall- bladder is merged with the tumor. In the greatly emaciated patient, a woman aged fifty- one years (Ho. 619, 1894), metastatic cancerous nodules were found in the brain (pons, oculomotor nucleus, and chiasm), lungs, heart, peritoneum, and left ovary. 60

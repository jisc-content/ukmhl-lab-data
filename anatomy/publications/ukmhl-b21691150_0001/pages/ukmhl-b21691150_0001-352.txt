The most serious complication of a hernia is incar- ceration with occlusion or stenosis of the intestine (different degrees of stenosis). The term elastic incarceration is employed when, the hernial opening being relatively narrow, a sud- den increase of the intra-abdominal pressure (forced inspiration, sneezing, straining) crowds a portion of the intestine into the sac and reduction is prevented by the elastic constricting opening. In faecal incar- ceration the cause lies in the intestine itself; this variety begins with the arrest of the contents, the expanding bowel drags adjoining loops toward it, and the patulousness of the afferent and efferent loops is suspended. The occlusion of the intestine causes the symptoms of ileus (miserere; stercoraceous vomiting), dilatation of the superior portions of the bowel, and meteorism. As a result of the compression exerted by the elastic hernial opening, which occludes partic- ularly the efferent veins of the mesentery, there are venous hyperaemia, hemorrhagic oedema, and hemor- rhagic dropsy of the hernial sac (sanguineous appear- ance of the hernial fluid), and finally gangrene and perforation of the constricted intestine, with septic peritonitis. Among other complications may be enumerated simple coprostasis, which may increase to faecal in- carceration and inflammation in numerous forms which may cause diffuse peritonitis. Invagination (intussusception) is the entrance of a Xjortion of the intestine into the adjoining inferior

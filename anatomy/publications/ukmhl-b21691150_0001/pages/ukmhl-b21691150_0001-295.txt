DISEASES OE THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 161 cirrhosis has a tendency to spread progressively from the apes to the remaining portions of the upper lobe; now and then we find the same process on a smaller scale at the tip of the lower lobe, when a descending tendency in its spread is likewise noticeable. Any possibly remaining parts of the pulmonary paren- chyma present desquamative and degenerative changes about the alveolar epitlielia or transitions to necrosis and caseation; such parts appear actually spotted, sometimes looking like granite. Owing to the con- traction of the pulmonary parenchyma there are sec- ondary dilatation of the bronchi and diminution of the thoracic space, especially in the upper segments. A separate description is required to explain the formation of cavities. The first beginnings of this process can be traced to circumscribed cheesy and necrotic degenerations at the apex of the lung (Plate 28, Fig. a), which attack the wall of a bronchus. Owing either to the necrosis of the wall of the bron- chus or to the puriform central softening of the focus, there arises an ulcerative defect in the bronchial wall, which enlarges slowly with the continual evacuation of the softened cheesy and necrotic parts. The cav- ity, originally the size of a hempseed or pea, in- creases by the advancing necrosis of the parietal layers, which is due partly to the effect of the tuber- cle bacilli, partly to that of accessory pyogenic germs. Should cirrhotic tissue surround the recently formed cavity, the necrotic destructive process will meet with great resistance. Rapid enlargement is often favored by the confluence of neighboring cavities; in this manner are produced larger, irregular defects with jagged walls, trabecular protrusions, and numerous 11

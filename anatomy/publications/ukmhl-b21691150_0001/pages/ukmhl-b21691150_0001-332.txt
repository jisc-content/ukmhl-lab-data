198 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. acute dilatations and muscular insufficiency may result in chronic peiâ€™manent dilatation. More frequently we meet with chronic dilatation of the stomach, which should be clearly differentiated from physiological megalogastria in healthy persons who habitually consume large quantities of food and drink. The condition may develop primarily, as an atonic muscular gastrectasia, in connection with ex- haustion (in typhoid fever, chlorosis, and neuras- thenia) or with chronic catarrhal gastritis; owing to the diminished tone of the muscular coat the stomach relaxes and dilates. Quite frequently we find second- ary or mechanical gastrectasia which develops from stenosis of the pylorus caused by cancer, cicatricial contraction, and hypertrophy of the muscular tunic. Contraction and shrinking of the stomach develop in stenosis of the cardia, in prolonged starvation, in cirrhotic and hypertrophic thickening of the gastric wall, in diffuse infiltrated carcinosis of the walls, or in diffuse neoplasms of the peritoneum; circumscribed contraction and hourglass constriction, in cicatricial contraction of the middle portion after the healing of a round ulcer. DISEASES OF THE INTESTINE. As the functional disturbances of the intestine go hand-in-hand with the corresponding functions of the stomach, so we also find on patliologico-anatomical grounds a certain coincidence. The noxm caused by faulty food and drink are the same, as are often also infectious and toxic influences; the results of circula- tory disturbances due to the liver or the heart are similar in the stomach and the intestinal canal.

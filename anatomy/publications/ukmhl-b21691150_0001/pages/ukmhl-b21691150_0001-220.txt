86 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. are whitish or grayish-white, at least at first, and are situated at the wall, especially in the indentations of the right ventricle, and intimately interwoven with the trabeculae; their size ranges from that of a pin’s head to that of a hempseed or pea, they are roundish in form, and either solid or contain in their interior a whitish-gray pyoid mass (puriform deliquescence). In the auricles they frequently attain a larger size, up to that of a cherry or plum; now and then they are laminated and mixed with the constituents of the blood, fie., mixed thrombi. In the left ventricle and auricle they are less frequent, and when present are located chiefly at the wall of the apex. In the development of marasmic thrombosis in the cavities of the heart the mechanical factor, the defec- tive circulation, evidently plays the chief role; under the influence of heart failure or cardiac marasmus stasis occurs in the indentations of the chambers; whether a lesion of the endocardium, defects of the endothelium, is a concomitant factor in their develop- ment is still undecided. On the other hand, the for- mation of marasmic thrombosis is certainly favored by alterations in the composition of the blood (leuco- cytosis, infectious processes, etc.). DISEASES OF THE ARTERIES. Arteriosclerosis, Chronic Endarteritis. Atheroma. (Plates 8, 9, 10, and 11.) The intima of the arteries contains no vessels—a peculiarity which largely influences the course of in- flammatory processes; swelling and functional dis- turbance are the main characteristics of such processes.

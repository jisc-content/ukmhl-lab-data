DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 131 often be drawn out entire if some care is exercised. The same disease occurs now and then in an appar- ently idiopathic, chronic, and relapsing form. Diphtheritic necrosing bronchitis, with the forma- tion of necrotic hemorrhagic foci, is very rarely ob- served in grave cases of pharyngeal diphtheria. Fetid or putrid bronchitis develops either simulta- neously with pulmonary gangrene or follows it, es- pecially after the inhalation of foreign bodies liable to decompose (food particles). This variety also occurs secondarily in bronchiectasis, in which the conditions—the accumulation of bronchial secretion in the dilated bronchi—favor the deposition and propagation of the germs of decomposition. In the worst cases fetid bronchitis causes now and then a fatal broncho-pneumonia or else general septicaemia or septico-pyaemia. Stenosis and occlusion of the bronchi (broncho- stenosis) results in the smaller bronchi from inflam- matory swelling of the mucosa or from the accumula- tion of pathological products such as pus, mucus, blood, serum (pulmonary oedema), and finally from the inhalation of foreign bodies, such as shirt buttons, cherry pits, fragments of bone, etc. Foreign bodies penetrate more frequently into the right than into the left bronchus, because the former passes in a direction more nearly vertical and constitutes more of a direct continuation of the trachea. When the foreign body is freely movable or but loosety im- pacted, there is danger that a fit of coughing may jn’opel it into the glottis with death from asphyxia at a late period. Foreign-body bronchitis may lead to pneumonic processes that may terminate fatally after

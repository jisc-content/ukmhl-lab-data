The muscle trichinae introduced with the food (pork) escape from their capsule, rap- idly attain maturity, and copulate; the females, which may live seven weeks, bear living young (0.1 mm. long) which pass through the intestinal wall and change to muscle trichinae in the muscles. Hogs acquire their trichinae, as a rule, from rats, in which they are extremely frequent, now and then also from other hogs (feeding with slaughter-house offal). Abnormal Position of the Intestine. Under this head belong herniae, invaginations, vol- vulus, and prolapse. Hernia. By hernia (rupture) we understand the position of a portion of the intestine outside of the abdominal cavity; the covering, the hernial sac, consists of the protruding parietal peritoneum and the external integument (cutis and subcutis). We distinguish external and internal hernias. In external hernia (the most frequent variety) the sac inclosing the prolapsed intestine consists of a sacculated protrusion of the parietal peritoneum within the accessory coverings (cutis and subcutis). In every hernia we must distinguish the hernial open- ing, the neck, the body, and the contents of the her- nial sac. The majority of hernine are acquired anomalies in the occurrence of which several factors may be active. Predisposing causes are inherited tendency, shape of the abdomen, inclination of the pelvis, and local proliferation of knuckles of fat in the subserosa of

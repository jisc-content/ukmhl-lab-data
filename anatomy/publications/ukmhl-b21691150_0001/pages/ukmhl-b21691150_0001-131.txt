Explanation of Plate 39. Colloid Cancer of the Stomach. The cardiac portion of the lesser curvature and the posterior wall of the stomach are occupied by a nearly oval tumor, the size of the palm of the hand, having a rather firm, wall-like, tumid margin; in its centre is an ulcer the size of a dollar. Corresponding to the upper portion of the ulcer the gastric wall is much thinned and translucent over an area the size of a dime. Within this thinned area is a perforation readily admitting a goose quill and opening into the abdominal cavity; the direction of the perforation is directly backward toward the spinal column. Both in the tumid margin and at the bottom of the ulcer we observe scattered through the cancerous mass semi-translucent colloid droplets, surrounded by a reticulated fibrous framework. The external surface of the stomach is united to the anterior abdominal wall by a firm, indurated tissue (perigastritis adheesiva) ; the region of the lesser curva- ture is greatly shortened and, corresponding to the tumor palpable from without, is covered with flat yellowish nodules, the largest the size of a lentil. Cause of deathâ€”acute pyo-fibrinous perforation peri- tonitis. There were also extreme general emaciation and brown atrophy of the heart. The patient was a man aged fifty-eight years (No. 13G, 1895). 39

240 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. factors are evidently active. Among the local con- tributory factors a certain role is obviously played by irritative conditions of the mucosa which cause decomposition of the bile (decomposition of the cho- late of sodium which keeps the cholesterin in solu- tion), and also by stagnation of the bile (tight lac- ing) ; besides, some general constitutional factors seem to influence the formation of gall stones, e.g., lack of exercise, sedentary occupation, obesity, and hereditary tendency. Gall stones are found in about seven per cent of all adult persons; in women two and a half times more often than in men (5 : 2). The predisposition of the female sex depends upon sedentary habits, slight muscular activity, tendency to obesity, and unsuit- able clothing. Corset liver and gall stones coincide in from thirty-three to forty per cent of women suffer- ing from cholelithiasis. At the age between thirty and sixty years gall stones are twice as frequent, and after the sixtieth year six times as frequent as between fifteen and thirty years; of women over sixty years old twenty-five to thirty per cent are affected with gall stones. In the majority of cases gall stones are discovered accidentally at the autopsy, they having caused no symptoms in the patient. As a rule they do not become pathogenic until they migrate, whether along the physiological passages of the ductus cysti- cus and choledochus, or after erosion and destruction of the walls of the gall bladder or of the channels just mentioned. Thus we occasional^ observe, after the development of peritonitic adhesions, the escape of stones into the duodenum, more rarely into the stom- ach and colon; quite exceptionally gall stones may

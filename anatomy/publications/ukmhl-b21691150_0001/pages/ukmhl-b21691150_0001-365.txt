DISEASES OF THE LIVER. 231 fat have something to do with it; conditions resulting from infection may sometimes also have their share. In all these forms the liver is markedly enlarged, the sharp margins are rounded, the tissue is cut easily, its consistence is almost like that of butter, and it is bloodless. Sometimes slight icterus is present, evi- dently the result of stenosis and occlusion of the smaller bile ducts by the excessively swollen and fatty infiltrated parenchyma of the liver. Inflammation of the Liver. Hepatitis. Purulent hepatitis is always focal and usually mul- tiple; the abscesses vary in size and may reach that of a fist and larger; the pus is often mixed with de- tritus, shreds of tissue, and bile. The disease is generally of embolic origin, springing from the radi- cles of the portal vein when infectious, purulent, and septic processes have developed in the neighborhood of the branches of that vessel, especially in the wall of the colon (dysentery) or the vermiform appendix, and caused septic thrombo-phlebitis. The abscesses are usually subcapsular and may give rise to purulent perihepatitis and peritonitis. The portal branches of the liver are often filled at the same time with dis- colored, semi-soft thrombi undergoing purulent dis- integration. The hepatic abscesses which are so frequent in the tropics and were formerly regarded as idiopathic affections are probably without excep- tion of embolic origin and develop by preference in connection with tropical dysentery. By paradoxical or retrograde embolism infected thrombi, perhaps derived from the peripheral veins of the head, may

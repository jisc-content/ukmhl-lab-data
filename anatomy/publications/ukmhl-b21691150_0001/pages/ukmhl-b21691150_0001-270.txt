136 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. When infected blood is effused into healthy or dis- eased portions of lung, various forms of inhalation pneumonia result. A special group is formed by hemorrhagic infarc- tions produced by embolism of branches of the pul- monary artery. These infarctions vary in size from that of a pea to that of a walnut, but sometimes they attain the size of a fist, so that they occupy the major portion of a lobe. Their shape is that of a wedge, whose point corresponds to the occluded arterial branch, the base to the pulmonary pleura. The in- farctions, moreover, project markedly beyond the surrounding tissue, are firm in consistence, devoid of air, and blackish-red in color; the overlying pleura is generally covered with a delicate network of fibrin. Not every embolic occlusion of the pulmonary arterial twigs causes the development of a hemorrhagic infarc- tion ; in cases of occlusion of the main trunks of the pulmonary artery and in extreme anaemia and weak- ness of the heart there is often absolutely no reaction in the affected vascular region. Aside from arterial occlusion of sudden origin, the occurrence of hemor- rhage, especially in the pulmonary capillaries and veins, is favored by increased cardiac blood pressure, such as exists in valvular disease of the left heart, in degenerative conditions and exhaustion of the heart muscle. This is the explanation of the fact that hem- orrhagic embolic processes are observed with special frequency in a lung that is in a condition of chronic congestion, of brown induration. As a ride it is pos- sible to demonstrate the primary thrombus which forms the starting-point of the embolism in the right ventricle or auricle or in the distribution of the pe-

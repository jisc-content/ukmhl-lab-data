DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN'S. 1G7 frequently the seat of metastatic carcinoma (Plate 32) or sarcoma, both of them in the form of multiple, usually subpleural nodules of different sizes. Parasites of thf Lung. Aside from vegetable microparasites which repre- sent the regular cause of the frequent and manifold inflammations of the lung, where they evidently find few obstacles to their nidation and multiplication, animal parasites are very rare in the lung, the echi- nococcus being perhaps the only one. DISEASES OF THE PLEURA. (Plates 31 and 32.) Injuries of the pleura usually cause the effusion of blood into the pleural sac (hsemothorax) ; in penetrat- ing wounds of the chest or with simultaneous injury of the lung air frequently enters the pleural space at the same time (hsemo-pneumothorax). Pneumothorax, the entrance of air into the pleural sac, occurs as a rule in consequence of perforation of the pulmonary pleura by cavities, abscesses, or gan- grenous foci of the lung. By far the most frequent cause (four-fifths of all cases) is some ulcerative proc- ess of rapid development in recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis, usually combined with purulent pleu- risy (pyo-pneumothorax). On opening the abdomi- nal cavity the diaphragm of the affected side is seen to bulge downward; when one of the intercostal spaces is perforated the air escapes with a hissing noise. The lung is frequently correspondingly collapsed and

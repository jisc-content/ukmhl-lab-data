DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 157 Tlie lungs appear enlarged, heavy, dark blue or brownish-red, and the pleura is transparent; * through the latter we observe numerous small, sometimes barely visible gray nodules, whose centres show a slightly yellowish turbidity. The same nodules (miliary tubercles) are found abundantly scattered through the pulmonary parenchyma, which is rich in blood and succulent and whose contained air is more or less diminished. Frequently the nodules are some- what larger in the upper than in the lower lobes, so that the conclusion appears justified that also in acute lnematogenous auto-infection the upper lobes present more favorable conditions for the development of mili- ary tubercles than the better vascularized lower lobes. Besides the acute and peracute miliary tuberculosis (Plate 28, Fig. b), which may terminate fatally in ten to fourteen to twenty-one days, in which the specific infectious granulomata are in the form of minute, punctiform, gray, and sometimes barely visible nod- ules, and the cut surface of the lung appears as if sprinkled with extremely fine sand, we occasionally observe also a subacute miliary tuberculosis of the lungs, in which the granules, ranging from the size of a pinâ€™s head to that of a hempseed, with greater yellowish turbidity in the centre, are uniformly scat- tered through the parenchyma. In acute miliary tuberculosis we find as a rule some- where in the body, most frequently at the apex of the lungs or in the lymphatic glands, an older cheesy and localized tuberculosis as the starting-point of the ter- minal and invariably fatal auto-infection. Acute miliary tuberculosis of the lung, as a local phenomenon of general miliary tuberculosis with the

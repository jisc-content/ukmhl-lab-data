CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. 85 are ascribed to a lesion of the valves, which, however, are seen to be perfectly normal at the autopsy. That valves affected with chronic disease form a locus minoris resistentise, that relapses occur (endo- carditis recurrens, Plate 5, Fig. a), and that occasion- ally also infectious septic processes are localized by preference upon diseased valves, has been stated above. Finally, it is readily understood that the inflamed heart valves often give rise to emboli which penetrate from the valves of the right heart into the lungs, and from those of the left heart into the major circulation (brain, kidneys, spleen [Plate 15], and the arteries of the lower extremities). In benign endocarditis such emboli produce merely a mechanical effect, causing various disturbances of the circulation, infarctions, and neurotic processes; in malignant infectious endo- carditis they give rise to metastatic abscesses, in short to the picture of embolic septico-pymmia. Thrombosis op the Heart. (Plate 5, Fig. b.) The chambers of the heart are more frequently the seat of thrombi than is any other part of the vascu- lar system. Aside from the secondary thrombotic thickenings and deposits in valvular and parietal endocarditis, we find in numerous, especially chronic diseases maras- mic thrombi as terminal and preagonal products; these are particularly important in estimating the vital energy of the heart, but they are so more for the pathological anatomist than for the clinician.

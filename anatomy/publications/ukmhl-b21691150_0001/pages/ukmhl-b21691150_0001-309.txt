DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 175 glands; such suppurations may in turn cause second- ary pericarditis or pleurisy. Of tumors, aside from secondary carcinomatous and sarcomatous diseases of the lymphatic glands, we oc- casionally find primary sarcomata sometimes of large size, more rarely dermoid cysts. Mediastinal sarco- mata (usually fibro-sarcomata or round-celled sarco- mata) extend to the neighboring organs; their effect upon the latter largely coincides with those of aneu- risms of the thoracic aortaâ€”compression of the main bronchi, of the large veins, and of the vagus nerve.

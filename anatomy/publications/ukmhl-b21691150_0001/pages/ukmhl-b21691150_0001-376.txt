ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 242 called catarrhal icterus. In various forms of hepatic cirrhosis, in interstitial syphilitic hepatitis, compres- sion or obliteration of the smallest bile ducts in the liver takes place, with consequent escape of the bile into the blood. Changes in the blood pressure after birth and patency of the ductus Arantii are said to cause icterus neonatorum. Through the influence of infectious or toxic ma- terials which destroy the blood corpuscles — for instance, in sepsis, septico-pyaemia, pneumonia, poisoning by phosphorus, arseniuretted hydrogen, pyrogallic acid, ether, chloroform, mushrooms, snake bite, and toluylendiamin—an icterus occurs without the occlusion of the bile ducts, that was formerly enumerated as the opposite to the hepatogenous or mechanical form. The theory that the free haemo- globin in the blood could without the intervention of the liver be directly transformed into bile pigment, was rendered improbable by the fact among others that in this form of icterus biliary acids could be demonstrated in the urine. The theory of haemato- genous icterus was definitively disposed of by experi- ments on birds, whose liver was placed out of function by ligating the ductus choledochus and the blood-ves- sels, when it became impossible to produce icterus by the poisons named above. Without the liver there is no bile pigment and hence no icterus. These infectious and toxic forms of icterus, therefore, are primarily dependent upon extensive blood alteration (disinte- gration of many red corpuscles) and have more prop- erly been designated as haemato-liepatogenous icterus. Such an icterus with polycholia, accordingly, results when the liberated haemoglobin as it were overwhelms

188 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. Cadaveric softening (gastromalacia) is often found in the region of the fundus; the wall for a variable distance is changed into a friable slimy mass which tears on touch or on removal of the organ. Circulatory Disturbances.â€”Hyperaemia of the mu- cosa is found in a circumscribed form as red spots, frequently in consequence of hypostasis, particularly in the region of the fundus and on the posterior wall (Plate 36); it may be mistaken for focal hemorrhages. Hemorrhages into the gastric mucous membrane may be often observed. The hemorrhage occurs by diapedesis in connection with congestive or inflam- matory hypersemia or with venous stasis, the mucosa showing a corresponding capillary filling with bright or dark blood. The hemorrhages may also result from rhexis, when they are multiple and sharply demarcated, usually in spots or streaks; associated with them are superficial shallow epithelial defects and losses of substance, i.e., hemorrhagic erosions of a blackish color; these are met with in septic infec- tions, in intoxications, as infectious emboli. Larger hemorrhages into the lumen of the stomach are gen- erally caused by ulcerative processes; they are de- rived from cancerous ulcers or from eroded larger arterial trunks at the bottom of round gastric ulcers; in the latter case the effused blood forms a coffee- ground-like blackish mass, owing to the influence of the gastric juice. Blood in the stomach may also have been swal- lowed, e.g., in fracture of the base of the skull.

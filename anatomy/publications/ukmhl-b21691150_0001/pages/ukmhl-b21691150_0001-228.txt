94 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. tis and mesarteritis. Tlie importance of sudden or oft repeated increase of blood pressure in the causa- tion of aneurisms is shown by the fact among others that these morbid changes occur twice as frequently in men as in women, though other factors (alcoholism and syphilis) may have a share in their production. In general, aneurism resembles a slowly growing tumor which displaces, compresses, and more or less erodes neighboring organs; neither soft parts nor bones are able to resist it long. Every aneurism possesses the potentiality of progressive growth; the course is slow and the beginning of the dilatation can rarely be determined; the average duration is said to be between one and four years. In the younger pa- tients with a vigorous heart the growth is usually more rapid. Death ensues from intercurrent dis- eases, sometimes from impaired pulmonary circula- tion or disturbed respiration. A frequent and uni- formly fatal issue is by rupture, which occurs during some temporary increase in cardiac activity with re- sulting rise of arterial pressure, when internal hemor- rhage is the direct cause of death. Aneurisms of the thoracic aorta perforate by pref- erence into the pleura, pericardium, trachea, lung, and oesophagus. In the peripheral arteries aneurisms are quite rare, the popliteal artery forming an exception. In the distribution of the cerebral arteries we often find very small aneurismal dilatations—miliary aneurisms— which are regarded by many as the starting-points of spontaneous hemorrhages of the brain, occasionally also larger aneurisms from the size of a pea up to the t of a hazelnut, due to arteriosclerosis, syphilitic

Ill LYMPHATIC GLANDS. penetration of tuberculous cheesy glandular foci into the blood circulation, i.e., lisematogeneous auto- infection with the development of general miliary tuberculosis or of a metastatic tuberculous basilar meningitis. Etiologically, glandular tuberculosis of children (tuberculous scrofulosis) is to be traced to intestinal infection by the food (the milk of tuberculous cows) and the accidental swallowing of infected material while crawling on the floor or to infection by the air. Altogether different in their causation from this form of glandular tuberculosis, which is frequent in the children of tuberculous parents, are certain forms of subacute, subchronic, and chronic glandular swell- ing (benign, non-tuberculous form of scrofulosis) which, while occurring in subjects of the same age, has no connection with tuberculosis and whose course and termination (in the worst cases suppuration, ab- scess formation, and external opening) are as a rule favorable. Secondary tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands is frequent in children and young persons, but much rarer in tuberculosis of older subjects. Anatomically it resembles primary glandular tuberculosis; after a certain length of time the glands are always enlarged and contain more or less scattered cheesy foci. Both primary and secondary glandular tuberculosis may terminate in spontaneous recovery by calcification of the caseous masses. In children the abdominal lym- phatic glands, especially the mesenteric, retroperito- neal, portal, and epigastric, are sometimes enor- mously enlarged and cheesy (tabes mesenterica).

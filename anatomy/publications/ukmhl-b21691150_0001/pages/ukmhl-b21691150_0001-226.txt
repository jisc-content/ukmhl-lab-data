By aneurism we understand a dilatation of the ar- terial tube that either extends over larger portions of the vessel or is confined to a sacculation at a certau point; in the latter case the communication between the lumen of the artery and the sacculated divertic- ulum forms a kind of ostium which has usually a smaller diameter than the aneurismal sac proper. The diffuse, sometimes spindle-shaped or cylindrical dilatations (fusiform aneurisms) affect all the parts of the vessel wall almost uniformly, while the saccu- lated aneurisms (Plates 8 and 12) arise usually from a circumscribed sudden lesion of the media, i. e., aneurisms by rupture. Aneurisms vary greatly in size: on the smallest arterial twigs they rarely exceed a millet seed (mili- ary aneurisms), on the thoracic aorta they often attain the size of a fist, of a childâ€™s head, and more. Aneurism develops most frequently upon the tho- racic aorta (six-sevenths of all internal aneurisms), the sites of predilection being the ascending portion and the arch. The slighter grades and initial stages of dilatation of the aorta are frequently discovered incidentally in persons above the age of fifty and sixty years. The wall of an aortic aneurism presents as a rule more or less advanced grades of chronic de- forming inflammation. Aside from irregular thicken- ings, especially of the intima, we observe, particularly

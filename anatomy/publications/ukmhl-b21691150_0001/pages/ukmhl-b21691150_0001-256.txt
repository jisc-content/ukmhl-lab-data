122 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. On tlie septum ulcerations are met with in the form of furrows passing in a longitudinal direction. The process extends by preference to the bones of the sep- tum, especially the turbinated bodies; owing to the accompanying rarefying osteitis the affected bones acquire an almost wormeaten appearance, the bridge of the nose and sometimes the entire bony framework of the nose is depressed. In some cases there are in addition ulceration and destruction of the external soft parts, with defects in the tissues around the nos- trils ; perforation into the oral cavity after destruction of the soft and hard palate, he., cleft palate, may be observed occasionally. In syphilis of the nose simi- lar affections of the mucous membrane of the oro- pharynx are frequently found. Neoplasms of the nasal mucosa are in the large majority of cases of the connective-tissue type; poly- poid adenomata are more rarely observed. Polypoid fibromata are usually very vascular (angio-fibromata), or very soft, juicy, cedematous, and with a gelatinous lustre, i.e., myxo-fibromata. Now and then they are multiple and represent transitions between polypoid rhinitis and true neoplasms. These tumors, brieffy described as nasal polpyi, are attached particular^ to the extremities of the middle turbinated, to the roof and the external wall of the nose, and in the fur- row between the inferior and middle turbinated bod- ies. In some cases the surface is more uneven and raspberrv-like. Hard fibroma, fibro-sarcoma, sarcoma, and carci- noma are rare; the latter sometimes extends from the external skin to the nose.

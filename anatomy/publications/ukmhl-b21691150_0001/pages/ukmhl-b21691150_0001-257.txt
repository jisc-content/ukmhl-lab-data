DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 123 2. DISEASES OF THE LARYNX. The inflammatory processes of the larynx coming under observation are rarely primary but more often secondary. Inflammations of the nasal and pharyn- geal mucosa extend by contiguity to the larynx and trachea (e.g., descending croup), and on the other hand inflammatory processes from the bronchi and trachea are propagated into the larynx (ascending processes). Besides, catarrhal laryngitis occurs symptomatically in acute infectious diseases such as measles, whooping-cough, typhoid fever, and small- pox. The anatomical alterations in acute and chronic catarrhal laryngitis resemble those of inflammation of the mucous membranes in general. Chronic laryngeal catarrh occurs especially in drunkards, in connection with pulmonary tubercu- losis, and as a result of habitual overexertion. A special variety of chronic inflammation is hyper- plastic laryngitis, which causes papillary prolifera- tions (pachydermia verrucosa), particularly on the mucous membrane between the arytenoid cartilages and at the posterior end of the vocal cords, where larger papillae are normally present. Diphtheritic and Croupous Laryngitis.â€”Croup and diphtheria of the larynx are found most frequently in idiopathic diphtheria of the pharynx. The croupous inflammation (Plate 19) causes the formation of a yellowish-grav or whitish false membrane, which covers either the inner surface of the whole larynx or only some of its parts; the tubular membrane often

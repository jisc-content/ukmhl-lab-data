Fibrous indurated myocarditis is sometimes due Fig. 2.â€”Indurated Myocarditis. Chronic interstitial myocarditis. Scat- tered through the heart muscle are streaky, whitish discolored masses of firm consistence, composed of fibrous connective tissue. These indurations are the product of a chronic interstitial inflammation whose cause in many cases cannot be determined. In a more circumscribed form we And callous metamorphoses of the muscular wall, particularly at the tip of the left ventricle and at the ventricular septum in sclerosis of the coronary arteries; in which case the masses of connective tissue represent the proc- ess of recovery from an embolic or thrombotic myomalacia, from an ansemic and hemorrhagic necrosis with secondary formation of indura- tions and cicatrices.

237 DISEASES OF THE LIVER. tlie stomach, intestine, female genitals, breast, and external skin. The tubercles range in size from a pin’s head to a fist, contain a central depression on the surface (umbilication), are sharply demarcated from the neighborhood, and whitish in color. Ic- terus and fatty infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma are sometimes found as complications. Secondary cancer of the liver also develops occa- sionally by direct extension from the stomach (lesser curvature or pylorus) or from the gall bladder and the larger bile ducts. DISEASES OF THE BILE DUCTS. The biliary passages of the liver, especially the finer ones, participate in the diseases of the hepatic tissue; especially with interstitial inflammation of the liver, with diffuse pareucliymatous processes, there may be stenosis or occlusion of the lumen with prevention of the escape of the bile, i.e., icterus. Inflammation of the bile ducts—cholangitis—de- velops along the ductus clioledochus by extension from the duodenum; swelling of the mucosa and in- creased secretion (formation of a mucous plug) are said to prevent the escape of the bile into the intes- tine and cause catarrhal icterus, so called. Chronic catarrhs are due mainly to gall stones; these latter occasionally produce in the ductus clioledochus cir- cumscribed necrosing inflammations (pressure necro- sis) which may result in perforation and secondary peritonitis. Purulent inflammation of the bile ducts develops at times in connection with gall stones and with perfoia-

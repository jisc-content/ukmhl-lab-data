81 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. many months or years, the chronic results and resi- dues of the acute infection. In some cases of as- serted fatal articular rheumatism a mycotic-bacillary septic valvular disease has been found; in such in- stances the trouble was evidently some septic disease, some general infection presenting the appearance of an acute febrile articular rheumatism (rheumatoid septic endocarditis and polyarthritis). The poly- morphous course of the process is to be explained, therefore—aside from the influence of the individual predisposition—by the variability and the degree of virulence of the germs of infection and by the transi- tional forms to septic infection. The infectious rheumatic form most probably runs its course as a verrucose endocarditis with the forma- tion of secondary thrombi—at the line of closure of the valve we observe delicate gray and grayish-red tubercles which appear moniliform along the line of closure after opening the valve; they gradually in- crease in size until they finally form larger coxcomb- like proliferations, consisting partly of newly formed young connective tissue, partly of thrombotic de- posits. A slow course and a tendency to relapses are often observed. A sharp distinction between verru- cose and ulcerative endocarditis is not feasible either on anatomical or on bacteriological grounds. Either form, when terminating in incomplete recovery, may change into chronic fibrous endocarditis. 6

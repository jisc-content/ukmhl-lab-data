ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 202 Croupous enteritis is very rare. Diphtheroid and necrosing enteritis (Plate 42) is characterized by marked swelling, injection, redden- ing, serous and sero-cellular infiltration of the intes- tinal wall, especially the mucosa and submucosa; the mucous membrane is enormously swollen, tumid, almost fluctuating, and divided into transverse, flab- by ridges. The upper layers of the mucous mem- brane may be in a condition of commencing or advanced eschar formation; at first appearing as if sprinkled with bran, later covered with dirty gray and dull yellowish eschars. Such severe and usually fatal forms of diphtheroid enteritis (colitis and proc- titis) are met with in true dysentery and also some- times in acute medicinal mercurial poisoning, in which cases the poison gains entrance to the body through the skin, the subcutaneous tissue, the serous and mucous membranes, or through internal adminis- tration, and is excreted by the intestine, especially the colon (Plate 43). In uraemia likewise, by reason of the auto-intoxication and the excretion of urea into the lumen of the bowel, we observe secondary toxic enteritis (enteritis ursemica), which may sometimes go as far as eschar formation in the upper layers of the mucosa; finally, a diphtheroid enteritis (colitis and proctitis) occurs in sepsis (Plate 44). Circumscribed necrosing and ulcerative inflam- mations of the intestinal wall develop sometimes in connection with stagnation of the contents of the bowel, especially in the colon; such stagnation, act- ing mechanically, infectiously, and toxically, produc- ing fiecal or stercoral pressure necrosis, which is particularly frequent and malignant in the vermiform

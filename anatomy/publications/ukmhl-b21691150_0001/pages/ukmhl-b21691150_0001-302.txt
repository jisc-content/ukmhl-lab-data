The effect upon the surrounding organs by the abnormal accumulation of air is otherwise similar to that of a pleuritic exudate. According to the condition of the critical perforative opening, the following forms are distinguished: 1. Closed pneu- mothorax, when the intrathoracic air is permanently shut off by closure of the perforation during both in- spiration and expiration. 2. Open pneumothorax, when the air space communicates during both inspi- ration and expiration with aerated lung tissue or with the external air in perforation of the thoracic wall. 3. Valvular pneumothorax, when during inspiration air enters and cannot escape during expiration. In consequence thereof the intrapleural pressure rises until at last no more air can enter. Besides these there are transitional forms. Hydrothorax (dropsy of the pleura) is character- ized by the effusion of serous fluid into the pleural cavity, the layers of this membrane being normal, smooth, glossy, and translucent. The serous transu- dation is usually of a wine-yellow color, bright, here and there hemorrhagic; as a rule it is bilateral and develops either as a local phenomenon of general dropsy or in connection with terminal pulmonary oedema (chronic or acute hydrothorax). Confined to one side the serous transudation is sometimes found with adhesive obliteration of the other pleural cavitjr, or when tumors of the mediastinum and aneurisms of the thoracic aorta compress and narrow the corre- sponding trunks of the pulmonary veins.

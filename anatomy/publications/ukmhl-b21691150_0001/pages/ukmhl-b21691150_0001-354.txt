Secondarily inflammatory processes and gangrene may result. DISEASES OF THE PERITONEUM. The peritoneum covers numerous and bulky organs; among the serous membranes of the body it possesses by far the greatest surface; this fact on the one hand, and the frequency of diseases of the organs which it covers on the other hand (stomach, intestinal tract, female genitals), make it easy to understand that changes of the peritoneum, especially such as are secondary in their nature, are observed in numerous instances. Ascites is met with either as a local symptom of general dropsy or occurs by itself in connection with prolonged and marked congestive liypersemia in the course of the portal vein, usually due to cirrhosis, carcinoma, and syphilis of the liver (hmmatogenous mechanical ascites), or local diseases of the perito- neum, particularly neoplasms (carcinosis, sarcoma- tosis), cause disturbed absorption and dropsy. In some cases several causes are combined, e.g., hydrse- mia and circulatory disturbances, or inflammation supervenes when dropsy has existed some shorter or longer time, i. e., inflammatory ascites. The quan- tity of fluid is very variable; it ranges from a few tablespoonfuls to ten and twenty quarts. Often we find as co-ordinated associated disturb- ances congestive catarrhs of the gastro-intestinal mu- cous membrane, oedema of the intestinal wall, and

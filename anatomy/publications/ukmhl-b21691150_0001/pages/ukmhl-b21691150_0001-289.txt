DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN'S. 155 Among tlie organs showing a predilection for tak- ing up and fixing the tuberculous virus from without, the lungs occupy the front rank; the tubercle bacilli enter the pulmonary alveoli with the inspired air in the form of dust. The predisposition of the lung tis- sue is shown by the fact that the large majority of cases of human tuberculosis begins in the lung and almost as a rule at the apex, the locus minoris resis- tentiae. This peculiarity of the apex is most clearly evidenced by the numerous cases (about one-fourth of all adult persons who have not directly succumbed to tuberculosis) of healed or healing apical tubercles (Plate 28, Fig. a) in subjects of different ages, dead of other processes. As in persons who breathe air charged with bacilli all parts of the lungs—as in the inhalation of soot—take up about the same quantity of virus, and, as pulmonary tuberculosis begins almost without exception at the apex, we are justified in con- cluding that by far the greatest majority of the germs of tuberculosis which reach the lung is destroyed by the physiological forces of the organism and perishes either in the pulmonary parenchyma or within the lymph channels. Of the many thousands of tubercle bacilli which reach the lungs in the form of dust, therefore, only a few that find at the apex the con- ditions favoring their deposition and multiplication produce a local infection. This predisposition of the apex of the lung is due to several factors, namely, defective function in habit- ual superficial respiration and stooping attitude, weak- ness of the respiratory muscles, epistatic and maras- mic anaemia in cardiac weakness and oligaemia. The local predisposition of the apical portions of the su-

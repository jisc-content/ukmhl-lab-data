Explanation of Plate 13. Marasmic Thrombosis of the Uterine Yetns. The venous trunks are completely occluded by thrombi which are evidently rather recent. A considerable time after delivery, under the influence of the defective cir- culation, thrombi developed in the uterine veins and ex- tended into both pampiniform plexuses, the spermatic veins, and the trunk of the inferior vena cava. In the latter the thrombus shows a light yellowish discoloration, a tough membranous consistence, and adheres firmly to the intima. In a peripheral direction both iliac and the crural veins are also thrombosed; on the left side the thrombus is undergoing puriform disintegration. The uterus was the size of a gooseâ€™s egg. The cause of death in this puerpera, aged thirty-two years (Uo. 708, 1895), was extreme general anaemia. There was also an incipient pleuro-pneumonia of the right inferior lobe. Death occurred five weeks after delivery. 13

Besides this intestinal infection, in which food, drink, and perhaps the saliva furnish the vehicles, there is also a hmmatogenous infection of the intesti- nal mucosa; in this manner, for instance, a secondary metastatic septic enteritis develops in general sepsis. In chronic intestinal catarrh (Plate 40) the mucous membrane is usually thickened and of a slaty gray color, especially in the chronic congestive catarrh that develops secondarily in chronic affections of the liver and heart. In some cases the mucous mem- brane is thickened together with the remaining parie- tal layers, and polypi develop, i.e., proliferating hy- perplastic enteritis, enteritis polyposa. Or else, following the acute enteritis of children, with general cachexia and anaemia, we find an atrophy of the glan- dular portions of the mucosa, i.e., chronic enteritis atrophicans. Follicular enteritis or follicular catarrh is the term applied to an intestinal inflammation in which the follicles are largely involved, especially in the lower ileum and the first portions of the colon (Plate 41). The mucous membrane shows the ordinary inflam- matory changes and, owing to the swelling of the fol- licles, a grater-like appearance. In some severe cases the follicles suppurate and break down, forming small abscesses (follicular abscesses) which perforate into the lumen of the intestine, and multiple follicular ulcers develop. These ulcers are small, from a lentil to a hempseed in size, and may coalesce. When such lesions are localized in the colon the cases are some- times designated as follicular dysentery.

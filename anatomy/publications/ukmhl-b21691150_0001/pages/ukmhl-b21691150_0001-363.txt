DISEASES OF THE LIVER. 229 form in echinococcus and syphilis, or in the lower segments of the right lobe after pronounced pressure atrophy (corset liver) of the adjoining portions. Diffuse true hypertrophy occurs, occasionally, es- pecially in connection with slight increase of the sup- porting frameworkâ€”a condition which is largely but erroneously included with hypertrophic cirrhosis (pseudo-hypertrophy); the etiological factors are chronic congestion, plethora, and the abuse of alco- hol (beer). Fatty Liver. An abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver is produced in different ways. 1. Fatty degeneration develops rapidly in connec- tion with and as a second stage of cloudy swelliug (parenchymatous hepatitis). The liver is moderately enlarged, pale, and succulent; in the liver cells we find numerous droplets of fat, usually of small size. In the higher grades (e.g., in acute intoxications) the liver is enlarged from thirty-three to fifty per cent, is of a gray clayey color, sometimes icteric, and the liver cells are completely filled with drops of fat. This acute fatty degeneration of the liver is found in moderate degree in grave acute infectious diseases (septic or pysemic infections, typhoid fever) associated with high pyrexia; besides it develops in a few days with intoxications (poisoning by phosphorus, arsenic, and iodoform). The highest degrees of fatty liver combined with icterus are found in phosphorus poi- soning (the contained fat rises from three per cent to thirty-two per cent of the fresh substance); the fat accumulating in large, masses in the liver is formed

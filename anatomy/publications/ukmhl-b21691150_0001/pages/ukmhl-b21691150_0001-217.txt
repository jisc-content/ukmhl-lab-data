CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. 83 presents frequently on tlie thickened valve tissue whitish and grayish-red granules, verruca;, varying in diameter and sometimes covered with thrombi. In the older, long-standing cases it is difficult without the aid of the microscope to distinguish between the thrombotic, partly calcified deposits and the inflam- matory exudate. The ostium of the valve, which is generally markedly stenosed, appears sometimes sur- rounded by mortar-like masses in which the valve cups have practically perished (endocarditis calculosa). The leaflets of the auriculo-ventricular valves, par- ticularly those of the mitral, are gradually trans- formed into indurated firm masses which coalesce and at last have an almost cartilaginous feel; the tendinous cords become progressively shorter and thicker and attain the diameter of a knitting-needle and above (endocarditis retrahens). In the semilunar valves, especially those of the aorta, we find in this disease, along with thickening of the free margins, which look as if rolled over, or of the entire valves, a corresponding shrinkage and shortening of the valve tissue, frequently also a co- alescence of the several leaflets. As the indurative process extends also to the ring of attachment of the valves it has a constricting effect upon the lumen of the ostium, and thus arise different degrees of stenosis of the latter. While the normal ostia of the heart of an adult man admit at least the index finger or the thumb, in the endocarditis here described we observe the ostium changed into a slit- like opening with rigid margins, which in advanced cases hardly admits a medium-sized lead pencil. Owing to the rigidity and shortening of the valves,

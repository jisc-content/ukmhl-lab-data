ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 216 the parietal peritoneum, whereby the fibrous parts are crowded apart and the affected portion of the peritoneum is dragged outward. Abnormal suspen- sion of the intestines, especially lengthening of the mesentery (enteroptosis), has also a predisposing effect. The exciting cause acts as follows: forcible straining, at once or when repeated, raises the intra- abdominal pressure, the less resistant portions of the wall give way, and local protrusion results. Congenital herniae (only inguinal and umbilical herniae) are among the arrests of development and represent persistent diverticula of the peritoneum. The most important forms are: 1. Inguinal hernia, constituting about five-sixths of all herniae, is found in men ten times more frequently than in women. A congenital inguinal hernia con- sists of the open processus vaginalis peritonaei, which is changed to a hernial sac when intestines prolapse into it; the contents (intestine) are in direct contact with the testicle; the hernial opening begins later- ally from the epigastric artery (“extei'nal” inguinal hernia). Much rarer than the external (lateral) inguinal hernia is the internal variety situated medially from the epigastric artery; this hernia passes vertically through the abdominal wall. 2. Crural hernia is far less frequent than inguinal hernia (1:9), and affects women more often than men (3 : 1). The hernial sac, which is small, protrudes from under Poupart’s ligament, crowding before it the fibres of the fascia cribrosa. 3. Umbilical hernia (three per cent of all herniae) occurs congenitally as an arrest of development with

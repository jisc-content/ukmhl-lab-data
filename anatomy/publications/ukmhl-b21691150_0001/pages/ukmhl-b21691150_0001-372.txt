ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 238 tion of hepatic abscesses into the ducts; the latter contain bile-stained pus mixed with desquamated epithelia. Dilatation of the bile ducts, especially the larger, occurs in connection with stenosis or obliteration of the ductus clioledochus; inflammation of the mucosa is very apt to be associated with it when the escape of the bile is prevented. When the occlusion of the ductus choledochus has lasted for a certain length of time, there will be considerable dilatation of the bile ducts and of the gall bladder as well; rarely the latter may rupture. When the cystic duct is occluded (for instance, by gall stones) the gall bladder is usually dilated and filled with mucus or watery fluid, he., dropsy of the gall bladder by retention. Inflammation of the mucosa of the gall bladder (cholecystitis) occurs in different gradations, namely, as simple catarrh with increased secretion of mucus and as purulent inflammation, particularly in conse- quence of gall stones. Necrosing (diphtheroid) and ulcerative cholecystitis with perforation, peritonitis, or evacuation into the stomach, duodenum, or colon may occur in typhoid fever. Very often we find ad- hesive pericholecystitis (agglutination with the trans- verse colon) as a residue of former inflammatory processes. Inflammation of the gall bladder majr also cause its atrophy and obliteration, especially in cholelithiasis (cholecystitis calculosa), which is, as a rule, associ- ated with obliteration of the cystic duct. When the obstruction to the outflow of bile persists for a- greater length of time it will cause enlargement

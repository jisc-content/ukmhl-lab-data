ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 170 1. Fibrinous or dry pleurisy. The pleura appears more or less injected, sprinkled with patches of ec- chymoses, somewhat opacified, with a dull lustre and velvety aspect; a delicate, gray, fibrinous deposit may be scraped off with the knife. Yery soon the sparse coagulated exudate is associated with a fluid effusion, resulting in: 2. Sero-fibrinous pleurisy, which is observed es- pecially in fibrinous (croupous) pneumonia. Owing to the increase of the fibrinous masses of exudate, we see the layers of the pleura covered with opaque whitish or yellowish-white pseudo-membranes, 0.5 to 1 cm. in thickness, whose surface shows numerous reticulated and villous prominences. The deeper por- tions of the exudate which are situated directly upon the pleura rapidly present intimate adhesions to the inflamed serosa, beginning organization, and conse- quently a transition to productive inflammation. In favorable cases, particularly when the masses of exu- date are not large, the liquid constituents are ab- sorbed, the adjoining surfaces become permanently glued together, with obliteration of the pleural cav- ity, i.e., adhesive pleurisy. Not rarely the sero- fibrinous exudate is mixed with blood—hemorrhagic pleurisy—which occurs especially in tuberculous, de- bilitated, and cachectic patients. 3. Purulent pleurisy (empyema) develops some- times from the preceding form or presents from the beginning an infectious character, being purulent ab initio. In the former case there are besides the puru- lent effusion more or less semisoft fibrinous deposits streaked with pus, or the sero-purulent or creamy- purulent fluid is mixed with numerous flakes of fibrin.

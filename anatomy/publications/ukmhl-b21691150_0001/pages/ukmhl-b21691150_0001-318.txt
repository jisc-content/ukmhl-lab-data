ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 184 seated abscess at the base of the tongue, from angina Ludovici of the soft parts about the floor of the mouth or about the larynx, and from retropharyngeal, para- pharyngeal, or prevertebral abscesses (Plate 34). Syphilitic ulcerations and cicatrices are found now and then in the pharynx and at the base of the tongue. Usually as a sequel of an angina with or without specific characters we find patches, flat thick- enings of the mucosa, rarely gummata, and finally shallow lardaceous ulcers, often in connection with syphilis of the nose. Tuberculous ulcers in the pharynx are rare; most frequently they spread upward from the larynx; in general the ulcerations resemble those of the larynx. Neoplasms of the pharynx are rare, aside from lymphomata of the lymphoid organs, and from con- nective-tissue polypi which develop downward from the walls of the choanse or from the base of the skull. Quite exceptional is primary carcinoma of the pharyngeal mucous membrane; secondary cancer de- rived from the upper part of the oesophagus, from the larynx, or from the thyroid gland is-occasionally met with. DISEASES OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS. Inflammation of the parotid gland (parotitis) oc- curs as a primary and epidemic disease (mumps). The gland is swollen, the exudate cellulo-serous; a viscid muco-purulent secretion accumulates in the efferent duct. The usual termination is in recovery. Besides, an infectious purulent parotitis develops secondarily in connection with certain infectious dis- eases, such as typhoid fever, scarlatina, etc. For-

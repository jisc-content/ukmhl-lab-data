230 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. only to a slight extent from the protoplasm of the liver cells (fatty degeneration); the greater portion is carried to the liver from other organs which have undergone a similar degeneration (fatty infiltration). In acute yellow atrophy, a process which for the time is still obscure, a considerable portion of the hepatic parenchyma perishes by fatty necrosis; the liver diminishes markedly in size within two to three weeks and appears flabby; on the cut surface red (alcoholic) and yellow (icteric) portions alternate (Plate 54). 2. The second principal form of fatty liver (fatty infiltration, Plate 52, Fig. a) is characterized by the fact that the fat is deposited in larger drops in the otherwise intact, merely enlarged liver cells; whether by reason of increased supply, or of diminished com- bustion, or of both combined. Belonging in part still among the normal conditions is the fatty liver of overfeeding which is met with in obesity; in the higher and extreme degrees (the contained fat rising to forty-four per cent of the fresh substance) it is pathological, as for instance in the artificially pro- duced fatty liver in overfed geese. Another form of this fatty infiltrated liver is frequently found in drunkards, sometimes associated with slight or marked degrees of cirrhosis (fatty cirrhosis). 3. Finally, a pronounced fatty infiltration of the liver is sometimes met with in very cachectic and emaciated persons (cachectic fatty liver), especially in cases of phthisis, carcinoma, and chronic fevers. The origin of this anomaly is rather obscure; per- haps the associated anaemia, increased decomposition of albumin, and consequent decreased combustion of

Explanation of Plate 54. Acute Yellow Atrophy of the Liver. (Two-thirds natural size.) The liver is reduced in all its diameters, altogether to nearly one-half of its normal bulk (weight, 920 gm. = 2 lb.). The capsule is wrinkled; the consistence is tough, very relaxed, and limp. The cut surface is partly ic- teric, partly diffusely reddish in color. The acinous marking is completely obliterated. Blood contents very scanty. On light scraping we obtain a yellowish colored, turbid juice in considerable amount. Other conditions found in the patient, aged twenty- one years (No. 161, 1895), were marked general icterus, fatty metamorphosis of the heart and kidneys, multiple subserous ecchymoses of the pleura, peritoneum, epicar- dium, and endocardium. 54

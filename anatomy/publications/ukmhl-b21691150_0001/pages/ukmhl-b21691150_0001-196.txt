62 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. ditis is very rarely observed; more frequently its ori- gin is luematogenous (articular rheumatism) and metastatic (in septico-pysemia) or secondary by ex- tension from surrounding structures; thus, cardial pericarditis is caused by the heart and its valves (endo-myo-pericarditis), and other inflammations are due to the pleura, the intrathoracic lymphatic glands, and the oesophagus. Circumscribed forms have a strong tendency to re- main stationary, to cause partial adhesion of the two layers of the pericardium, or to induce local thicken- ings and opacities of the pericardium (milk spots). A benign form of pericarditis, tending to recovery and adhesion of the layers of the pericardium, occurs occasionally with acute rheumatic polyarthritis, also with pneumonia, pleurisy, dyscrasic conditions, chronic nephritis, chronic alcoholism, and tubercu- losis; it is much more frequent in men than in women. At first it is usually circumscribed; there are red- dening, injection, with or without slight hemorrhages; the serosa presents a dull appearance, becomes opaque and velvety; a dull gray or pale reddish veil, resem- bling crape, covers the inflamed portions. The proc- ess extends from the visceral to the parietal layer, or vice versa. The fluid contents of the pericardium in- crease and become somewhat turbid. In the further course either absorption takes place, or, when the in- flammation advances, a coherent pseudo-membrane forms, which is easily detached, has a whitish-gray color, and consists chiefly of fibrin. When there is a steady increase of the fluid exu- date and of the fibrinous products which cover the

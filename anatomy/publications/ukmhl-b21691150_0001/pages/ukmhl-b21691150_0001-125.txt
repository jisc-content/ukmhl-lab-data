Explanation of Plate 37. Multiple Polypi op the Mucous Membrane of the Pyloric Portion of the Stomach. The pyloric portion of the stomach, over a region the size of the palm of the hand, is covered with a large number of spherical or pear-shaped polypi; the smaller of these are rather flat, the size of a hempseed, the rest ranging from the size of a pea to that of a cherry; they are semisoft in consistence, in part bright red, and have a juicy lustre. The affected portion of the gastric mucosa is markedly thickened and hypertrophicâ€”chronic gastritis polyposa. 37

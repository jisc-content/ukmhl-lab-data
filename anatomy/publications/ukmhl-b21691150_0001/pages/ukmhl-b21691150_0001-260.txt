The tumors here in question represent most frequently papillary fibroipata and epitheliomata, which constitute more than one-half, almost two- tliirds of all laryngeal tumors. Their surface is ver- rucose, nodular, or villous, corresponding to the papillary hyperplasia of the superficial layers of the mucosa. A second group of laryngeal tumors is formed by the nodular fibromata (fibroma tuberosum), which constitute about one-fourth to one-third of all polypi; they spring from the deeper connective-tissue layers of the mucosa and are seated chiefly on the true vocal cords. The rest of the polypi, about one- tenth of all cases, are simply mucous polypi and cysts (mxyo-fibroma and adenocysto-fibroma). Malignant tumors (sarcoma and carcinoma) are very rare as primary formations in the larynx; car- cinoma sometimes develops from the papillary epi- thelioma when of long standing. Secondarily and by extension from the surrounding structures laryngeal carcinoma occurs occasionally when the primary focus of disease is in the pharynx, the base of the tongue, the oesophagus, and the thyroid gland. TRACHEA AND BRONCHI. The trachea usually participates in the various dis- eases of the larynx and the bronchi; especially in in- flammatory processes the larynx and trachea are largely affected coincidentlyâ€”for instance, in croup- ous laryngo-tracheitis in connection with diphtheria of the pharynx.

241 DISEASES OF THE LITER. pass through external or biliary fistulae which open on the skin of the abdomen; in this way gall stones may escape spontaneously into the outer world. New formations in the gall bladder are not com- mon ; papillary epithelioma (cancer of the gall blad- der) occurs sometimes, especially in women, and extends by contiguity to the neighboring liver tissue. Almost without exception gall stones are found firmly impacted in the cancerous mass, forming as it were the nucleus of the carcinomatous proliferation; gall stones evidently favor the development of cancer in predisposed subjects. Cancer springing from the smaller bile ducts branches dichotomously along Glis- sonâ€™s capsule and penetrates into the liver like an infiltration. Icterus, Jaundice, Chouemia. (Plates 53 and 54.) By icterus we understand the pathological condition in which constituents of the bile, especially bile pig- ment, are present in the blood and in the tissues of the body. Mechanical, absorption, or stasis icterus develops when obstructions in the bile ducts, from the ductus choledochus to the smallest ramifications in the liver, partly or wholly prevent the physiological escape of the bile. Under this head belongs icterus occurring in connection with stones in the ductus choledochus, with tumors, and with parasites. When the flow of bile is obstructed icterus occurs after the lapse of thirty-six hours. Catarrh of the duodenum with ex- tension to the ductus choledochus is said to be suffi- cient to produce one of the most frequent forms, so- 16

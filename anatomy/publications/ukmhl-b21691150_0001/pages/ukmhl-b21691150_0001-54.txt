Explanation of Plate 14. Leuioemic Enlargement of the Spleen. Transverse section of an enormously hyperplastic spleen from a case of splenic-myelogenous and lymphatic leukaemia. The spleen (weight, 2,510 gm. = 88^ oz.) is nearly double the volume and weight of a small liver, its capsule is somewhat opacified, and it is distinctly lobulated at its sharp border. Distributed pretty uni- formly throughout it we see numerous Malpighian cor- puscles which are markedly swollen, mostly from the size of a hempseed to that of a pea, and are clearly dif- ferentiated from the surrounding pulp by their yellow- ish-white color. Among the associated conditions found in the patient, aged sixty-two years (No. 427, 1894), were lymphoid hyperplasia of the bone marrow which had a grayish-red color, and hyperplasia of the inguinal and cervical lymph glands, of the lymph follicles of the intestine, and of the mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph glands. The latter formed a nodular bunch the size of a child’s head; the individual lymph glauds were swollen to the size of a hen’s egg, had a semisoft medullary consistence, and a whitish-yellow color. In the liver, which was markedly enlarged, were diffuse leukaemic infiltrations of lymphoid cells. The leuco- cytes in the blood were greatly increased in number. Incidental findings at the autopsy were ascites, anasarca of the lower extremities, and sero-fibrinous pleuritis of the right side. Duration of the disease, whose cause is unknown, about one year. Characteristic of leukaemia is a considerable numerical increase of the white corpuscles; in the highest grades the proportion of the red to the white blood corpuscles is as 2 :3 or as 1:1, together with corresponding diminu- tion of the red corpuscles and of the haemoglobin con- tents. The white corpuscles are medullary cells (splenic- myelogenous form) or lymphocytes (splenic-lymphatic form) or both combined. 14

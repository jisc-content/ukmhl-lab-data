89 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. disease of the heart. Functional overexertion (Roki- tansky) is also likely to cause, in predisposed sub- jects, arteriosclerosis in some regions (the arteries of the brain, of the lower extremities, and the ascend- ing aorta). In persons who exhaust their powers prematurely by overexertion and perhaps expose themselves also to other detrimental influences (alco- holism, high living) arteriosclerosis is more frequent than under opposite conditions. The thoracic aorta, especially its ascending por- tion, is among the most frequently affected by the inflammatory and sclerosing process. From the as- cending aorta the inflammation extends very often to the adjoining aortic valves. The thickening and shortening of the valves, with the frequently coexist- ing dilatation of the ostium of the aorta, cause minor or major degrees of aortic insufliciencjq which is met with especially in men of middle and advanced age, develops slowly, and no acute articular rheumatism can be traced to explain the valvular disease. In such cases of apparently primary valvular affection the starting-point of the disease is the chronic endar- teritis of the ascending aorta, whose progressive char- acter is clearly marked.* * Among 1,800 dissections of adult cadavers sclerosis of the aorta associated with disease of the aortic valves was found in 136 subjects, in 25 of these with marked insufficiency and in 2 with stenosis of the ostium of the aorta. In slight aortic sclero- sis or when the process is located in the descending and the ab- dominal aorta (48 cases) the heart valves are unchanged. The sclerosis of the ascending aorta with secondary insufficiency of the aortic valves here discussed is found in men more than twice as often as in women ; the age of the male patients was between thirty-three and fifty-one years ; the average age of the men dead

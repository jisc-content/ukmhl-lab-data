The points of pre- dilection for the arrest and multiplication of the tuberculous virus are the lymph follicles (Peyer’s patches and solitary follicles) of the inferior small intestine and the adjoining colon, which have about the same predisposition to tuberculous infection as the other lymphatic glands of the body and the apices of the lungs. In the beginning of the affection we notice some follicles to be swollen to the size of a pin’s head or even of a hempseed and of a dull yel- lowish color; pressure or incision shows that the follicle is changed to a soft cheesy mass. As the cheesy necrosing process gradually erodes the cover- ing epithelial layer the centre breaks down and cup- shaped or crateriform ulcers appear, which rapidly enlarge by confluence in the region of Peyer’s patches. In this way large losses of substance result, which have an eroded bottom and indented margins; corre- sponding to the course of the blood and lymph ves- sels they have a tendency to spread circularly and thus result transverse belt or ring shaped constricting ulcers (Plate 45), usually associated with slight ste- nosis of the affected portion of the intestine; at the bottom and margins yellowish nodules are frequently embedded. On the corresponding serous coat we often find the local ulceration of the mucosa sharply marked by a reddish, whitish, or somewhat slaty discoloration of the former, as well as by a local eruption of tubercles. As in the case of the lung, we can distinguish acutely developed and rapidly ad- vancing ulcerations from those of gradual formation

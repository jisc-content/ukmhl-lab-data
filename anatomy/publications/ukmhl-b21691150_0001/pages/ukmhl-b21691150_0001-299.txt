DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 105 intact portions of the lung terminal accidental inflam- matory processesâ€”fibrinous, lobular, and lobar pneu- monia with consecutive exudative pleurisy, unless the pleural cavity has been previously obliterated. All the numerous and variously combined alterations with regard to their localization are besides charac- terized by the fact that the upper segments of the lung contain chiefly the older, ulcerative, and indura- tive processes; the middle and lower segments, the rapidly developed terminal inflammatory processes (desquamative and cheesy pneumonia, inhalation pneumonia, acute and subacute tubercles). In some cases the destruction of the lung has advanced so far that only about one-fifth to one-sixth of the entire organ is still capable of function. In harmony with the polymorphism of the anatom- ical picture and the course, which is often slow, ex- tending over many months and years, we find in pulmonary tuberculosis, as in no other pathological process, side by side nearly all morbid conditions belonging in general pathology. I may mention only the various inflammatory processes with their numer- ous products and terminations, the proliferative and neoplastic processes, the retrogressive metamorphoses (fatty and hyaline degeneration, caseation, calcifica- tion); all these numerous processes occur together and successively (a true microcosmus) in recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis. This circumstance explains the difficulty of an accurate and exhaustive descrip- tion of these manifold processes, which, moreover, present etiologically, with reference to the local and general predisposition, to the specific and mixed infection and intoxication, a variability and

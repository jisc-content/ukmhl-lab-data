Lastly, a purulent pericarditis may be of luematogenous and metastatic origin in general sepsis. Owing to the multiplicity of the causative factors, the demonstra- tion of the starting-point often requires particular care at the autopsy. The first manifestations of purulent and fibrino- purulent inflammation coincide largely with the alter- ations present in sero-fibrinous pericarditis; in very debilitated anaemic subjects, in whom purulent peri- carditis occurs occasionally as a terminal phenome- non, we find now and then no reddening and no fibrinous deposits on the layers of the pericardium; only the serous contents of the sac are somewhat in- creased, slightly turbid, and mixed with pus corpus- cles in moderate quantities (sero-purulent pericar- ditis) . In other cases the exudate is abundant and fibrino- purulent; both layers are covered with a yellowish- white, incoherent, and lightly adhering pseudo-mem- brane. In the fibrinous masses numerous leucocytes are embedded, the free exudate is creamy and mixed with flakes of fibrin. The termination is usually fatal. When the course is more chronic we find, be- sides the liquid and partly coagulated exudate, that the layers of the pericardium are covered with a firm, coherent connective-tissue membrane, sometimes sev- eral millimetres thick, whose surface preseuts flat tuberosities and appears as if granulated. Sanio-purulent pericarditis occurs very rarely, now 5

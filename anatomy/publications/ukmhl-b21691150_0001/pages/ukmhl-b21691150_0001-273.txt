DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 139 Emphysema of the Lung. Pulmonary emphysema presents two principal formsâ€”alveolar and interstitial emplij^sema. Vesicular emphysema of the lung, a chronic or- ganic affection of the organ, is to be distinguished from acute inflation of the lung; the latter represents a functional transitory dilatation of the alveoli (alve- olar ectasia) and generally results from increased in- spiration and impeded expiration, so that more air is inhaled than can escape during expiration. This acute pulmonary inflation (vicarious emphysema) occurs in numerous acute diseases of the lung, espe- cially in children, for instance, in capillary bronchi- tis, pneumonia, and atelectasis; it shows itself very characteristically at the median margin of the lung (marginal emphysema). In vesicular emphysema the lungs appear enlarged and cover the pericardium almost completely. The lungs do not collapse, have a puffy feel, retain the impression of the finger, and are diminished in weight. The enlarged pulmonary vesicles are visi- ble through the pleura; on close inspection it is seen that the larger spaces do not consist simply of dilated alveoli but that they have resulted from the conflu- ence of adjoining alveoli caused by atrophy of the septa. The condition may be due to various causes. Mechanical emphysema, so called, is produced by oft-repeated, prolonged, excessive inspiration and prolonged expiration. The continuous increased intra-alveolar pressure causes greater tension of the

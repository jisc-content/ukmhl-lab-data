In acute infec- tious splenitis we find the organ enlarged to two, four, or five times the normal; the capsule is tense, the pulp of a brownish-red color; the consistence is diminished, sometimes pultaceous, almost deliquescent, and the or- gan is full of blood; this is the case in typhoid fever (280-500-700 gm. =10-17^â€”25 oz.), pyaemia and septi- caemia (250-300-700 gm. =9-10^-25 oz.), anthrax, acute and subacute tuberculosis (170-220 gm.=6-8 oz.). In fatal croupous pneumonia, acute infectious splenitis is found in more than two-thirds of all cases, especially often in the stage of gray hepatiza- tion, in which there is an active regeneration of the cellular elements of the blood (leucocytes) in connec- tion with the enormous loss of blood (acute hemor- rhagic pulmonary exudation). In typhoid fever the en- larged spleen often contains circumscribed, dirty gray, necrotic foci, separated from the surrounding tissue by a demarcating suppuration; these probably result from the local stases and the necrosing effect of the patho- genic specific typhoid bacilli deposited in the spleen. Chronic hyperplastic splenitis is characterized by in- creased firmness of the parenchyma, by proliferation of the connective-tissue elements. This form is found especially in the splenic anaemia of children, in con- genital syphilis,* and in malaria. * The spleen of newly born children has an average weight of 9-10 gm. =139-154 gr. ; in congenital syphilis it rises to 15-32, even as high as 100 gm. =4, 1, 34 oz.

79 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. Infectious Endocarditis (Plate 4). (Endocarditis Maligna, Ulcerosa.) This occurs usually acutely, either primarily and cryptogenetically or secondarily and metastatically in septic wound infection, puerperal sepsis, etc. The cause, as a rule, is the deposition and multi- plication of septic germs (staphylococci and strepto- cocci). The sites of predilection are the valves of the left ventricle, also chronically diseased valves for the form of recurrent endocarditis; the primary localiza- tion is especially apt to be the line of contact and closure of the valves, so that we are justified in as- suming that mechanical lesions of the endothelium produce a sort of local predisposition which greatly favors the deposition and multiplication of the patho- genic germs. The frequency may be stated as about 0.6 per cent of all cadavers; seven to eight secondary cases to one primary; twenty-five per cent of all cases belong to the class of recurrent endocarditis, that is to say, the infectious germs develop with spe- cial preference upon diseased valves. Four-fifths of all cases of septic diphtheroid endocarditis occur in the left heart, especially at the aortic valves; only one- fifth affect the valves of the right heart. In the beginning we observe slight roughness and unevenness of the first-affected portions of the valves, minute defects and lesions of the endocardium, whose bottom and surroundings are characterized by a dis- colored, dull gray appearance. The delicate valve tissue becomes opaque, rotten, and friable; some con- stituents of the blood are rapidly deposited in the

DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 183 quires a special predisposition, which is very frequent in children and rare in adults; the blood serum of persons having no predisposition possesses antitoxic properties. Diphtheroid affections without specific bacilli do not belong to the type of true diphtheria, and wher- ever they occur (not only in the fauces but also on other mucous membranes, such as that of the bladder and of the intestine) should be designated as diph- theroid or simply as necrosing processes. In true pharyngeal diphtheria the mortality may reach fifty to sixt3r per cent; in diphtheroid affections and other anginas at most one to four per cent. Rare though very malignant forms of infectious angina are: Erysipelatous and Phlegmonous Pharyngitis. Both are diffuse inflammations of the mucosa and submucosa due to streptococcal infection. The mu- cous membrane is greatly swollen, especially at the aditus laryngis (acute inflammatory oedema of the glottis), and reddened. If the exudation is purulent the affected parts appear pale yellowish and almost fluctuating; on incision an abundant sero-purulent infiltration may be expressed. The tonsils are often likewise markedly swollen. Such cases of malignant diffuse streptococcal angina usually end fatally in a short time (sometimes one or two days); they origi- nate either primarily, as it were cryptogenetically without demonstrable point of entry, or secondarily from purulent or sanio-purulent processes in the vicinity of the pharynx, for instance, from a deep-

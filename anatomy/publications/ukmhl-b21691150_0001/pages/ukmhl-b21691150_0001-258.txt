The mucous membrane is swollen, injected, and some- times contains scattered hemorrhages; the epithe- lium is necrotic. In other cases we observe along with the formation of croupous deposits spots of a dull gray infiltration of the mucous membrane, espe- cially on the vocal cords; also superficial and deep eschar formation which terminates in ulceration. Diphtheroid laryngitis with final ulceration is ob- served in about twelve per cent of all cases of typhoid fever; the ulcers sometimes extend down to the car- tilage with resulting perichondritis; usually they occur in the third week of the disease. Acute erysipelatous inflammation of the mucous membrane (Plate 21) and submucosa occurs now and then primarily in persons in previous good health. This dangerous affection, which may cause sudden death by stenosis of the larynx, is largely and rather loosely described as acute oedema of the glottis. Sec- ondarily we meet with inflammatory oedema of the larynx and the aditus (aryepiglottic folds) in numer- ous inflammatory and ulcerative processes of the same organ and of the fauces, in angina Ludovici, in pre- vertebral abscesses, etc. In rare cases we observe phlegmonous laryngitis with extensive purulent infil- tration and great swelling of the mucosa and sub- mucosa, now and then in connection with a similar affection of the pharynx (pharyngo-larvngitis). Ulcerative laryngitis is occasionally found as a sequel of chronic catarrh or associated with it; the ulcers are shallow, superficial, and more like erosions. Ulcerative tuberculous laryngitis (Plate 20) occurs in about one-fifth of all cases of chronic pulmonary

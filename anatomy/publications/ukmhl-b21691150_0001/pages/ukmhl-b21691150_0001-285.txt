DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 151 anatomically a typical course. In the beginning (first stage) the pulmonary tissue appears rich in blood, juicy, swollen (engouement, stage of engorge- ment) , with reduction of the contained air. After a short time (one to two days) red hepatization follows (second stage, see Plate 26); the doughy and spleen- like consistence changes to that of the liver; the affected lobes are voluminous, heavy, airless, and brownish-red in color; a rigid, cellulo-fibrinous, and hemorrhagic exudate being effused into the air spaces of the lung. The pleura is tense, the parenchyma rather soggy, the cut surface finely granular, since the alveolar plugs of fibrin project beyond the level of the cut surface, and on being scraped with the knife are visible to the naked eye as numerous parti- cles like grains of sand. In serious and fatal cases a third stage follows about the seventh or eighth day, i.e., gray hepatization (Plate 27); the red and brown color gives j>lace to a gray tint, evidently owing to the rapid disintegration of the red blood corpuscles and absorption of the coloring matter. The tissue is still more juicy and friable; a creamy, almost pyoid fluid in large amounts can be scraped from the cut surface. In some cases there is a true purulent infil- tration of the affected portions of the lung; rarely abscess formation and gangrene follow. The fatal issue, which occurs in about one-fifth of all cases and almost without exception in the stage of beginning gray hepatization (from the sixth to the eighth day), is usually due to oligsemia and heart failure. When recovery results, resolution and absorption of the ex- udate begin on the seventh day. In that case normal circulatory relations set in with active regeneration of

182 ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Accidental processes observed are: Secondary (or mixed) infection by streptococci; the picture of septic diphtheria develops, which causes deep-seated necrotic infiltrations of the mucosa of the nasopharynx and grave general symptoms. Or else germs of decomposition of various kinds develop in the eschars and gangrenous diphtheria (Plate 33) re- sults, terminating almost invariably in death. The diphtheritic and croupous deposits may extend to the hard palate, to the mucous membrane of the cheek, tongue, lips, and nose in very serious cases, which usually terminate unfavorably. We may also observe extension of the diphtheritic process to the larynx, the trachea (descending croup), stenosis and occlusion of the aditus laryngis and the glottis, owing partly to the great swelling of the mucosa, partly to the super- ficial fibrinous exudate. In the cases of pharyngeal diphtheria admitted to the hospitals, which are usu- ally severe, the larynx remains free in the majority (fifty-eight per cent). The secondary complications seen are inflammatory swelling of the submaxillary lymphatic glands and, with extreme frequency, ter- minal lobular and lobar pneumonia. The severe gen- eral symptoms and the secondary affections of inter- nal organs (kidneys, heart, liver, and spleen) are due to the effect of the toxins produced by the diphtheria bacilli or, in cases of mixed infection, also to general septic disease. Diphtheria is either of contagious or of miasmatic origin; virulent diphtheria bacilli are occasionally present in the fauces of healthy children (facultative parasites) and for some length of time after recovery from the disease. The development of the latter re-

Explanation of Plate 49. Cheesy Tuberculosis of the Mesenteric Lymphatic Glands. In the mesentery are found a larger number of swollen lymphatic glands, ranging in size from a hempseed to a cherry, which are distinctly differentiated from the sur- rounding structures by their yellowish-white color and their partially somewhat reddened capsules. The cut surface of the glands resembles in color and consistence that of a raw potato. The specimen was derived from a child, aged four months (No. 379, 1895), which had died of an acute general miliary tuberculosis of the lungs, liver, and spleen, which was secondary to an older cheesy tuber- culosis of the lymphatic glands of the neck and of the cavities of the thorax and abdomen. The associated conditions were caries of one petrous bone, furunculosis, intestinal catarrh, and general atrophy. The childâ€™s mother had died soon after the delivery of tuberculosis with extremely rapid course. (Infection of the child by the mother early after its birth.) 49

64 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. in all possible gradations, from simple circumscribed milky opacity and thickening of the pericardium (milk spots) to partial adhesion or total agglutina- tion of both layers of the pericardium (partial or total adhesive pericarditis). In this way the exuda- tive has changed to a productive inflammation, the liquid and amorphous solid products becoming ab- sorbed, and in their place develops by way of substi- tution a vascularized fibrillary connective tissue which at first is rich in cells but later contains only few ves- sels and cells. In partial adhesive pericarditis fibrous connective-tissue trabeculae (synechiae) connect the two layers, while in total obliteration of the pericar- dium we find delicate or firm, sometimes membranous and calcified thickenings of the serous layers. In many cases of tardy or defective absorption the fibri- nous exudate becomes thickened, caseous, and calci- fied ; in the latter case callous and chalky masses sur- round like a shell smaller or larger portions of the heart muscle (pericarditis calculosa). That in the more intense forms of pericarditis the subepicardial external layers of the heart muscle may participate anatomically and functionally in the inflammatory process (peri-myocarditis) is easily understood. Infectious pericarditis is chiefly represented in the purulent and tuberculous forms of inflammation. Purulent Pericarditis. This form arises either through trauma or by con- tinuity from surrounding structures; for instance, from infectious endocarditis and myocarditis, pleu- risy, morbid processes having their primary seat in

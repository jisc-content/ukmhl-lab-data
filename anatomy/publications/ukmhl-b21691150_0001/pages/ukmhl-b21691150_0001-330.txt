In other cases this form is more diffuse and spreads over the greater part of the stomach, which is usually contracted (cirrhosis)—a condition sometimes closely resembling simple, inflammatory, non-cancerous, or benign cirrhosis. Colloid cancer is more apt to form diffuse infiltra- tion; the reticular and alveolar stroma incloses nu- merous lacunae containing transparent gelatinous drops; on the cut surface the firmly infiltrated and thickened wall of the stomach sometimes presents a honeycomb appearance. Colloid cancer tends to ex- tend by continuity to neighboring organs (the greater and lesser omentum) and to the lymphatic glands (Plate 39). In very rare cases only do we find the cancer con- fined to the stomach and the lymphatic glands not in- volved. The condition of the latter (especially the epigastric glands) by the way, and, as a rule, both macroscopically and microscopically, greatly facili- tates the differential diagnosis between cancer and other ulcerative processes. All the above-named forms of cai’cinoma tend to pass through the walls of the stomach and to involve the peritoneum; they also have in common the tendency to cause stenosis of the pylorus, gastrectasia when seated at the latter point, recurring minor hemorrhages, and perforation of the wall of the stomach. The last-mentioned accident is retarded and postponed by adhesion and agglutina- tion of the weakened portion to the adjoining struc- tures (pancreas, liver, duodenum, transverse colon, more rarely the anterior abdominal wall). Perfora- tion into the colon with the formation of a bimucous

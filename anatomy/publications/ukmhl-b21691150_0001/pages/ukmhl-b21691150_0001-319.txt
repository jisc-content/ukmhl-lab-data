185 DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. merly tlie cause was ascribed to a hiomatogenous metastatic inflammation, but more probably the dis- ease is due to tlie entrance of septic germ3 from tlie mouth through Stenoâ€™s duct into the gland tissue, where they set up a purulent or sanio-purulent paro- titis. The scanty ingestion of food and the dimin- ished or arrested secretion of saliva greatly facilitate the penetration of pathogenic germs. The gland is swollen, firm and fleshy in appearance, and often in- filtrated with a sero-purulent mass. The inflamma- tion may terminate in abscess formation, partial sloughing of the gland, perforation of the pus pockets into the oral cavity, or externally, or into the external auditory meatus. This glandular suppuration or sloughing may also lead to a general embolic septico- pyemia. Neoplasms in the parotid gland are not rare, espe- cially sarcoma in numerous modifications, namely, fibro-, myxo-, chondro-, and adeno-sarcoma; more rarely carcinoma. DISEASES OF THE CESOPHAGUS. Acute oesophagitis, catarrhal inflammation of the gullet, is a very rare disease. The inflammatory changes, most closely resembling those of the corre- sponding affections of the oral cavity, are slight, being chiefly proliferation and increased desquama- tion of the epithelium. The causes may be mechani- cal (foreign bodies), chemical (strong alcoholic liquors), and thermic irritations; rarely j>rocesses extending down from the pharynx or up from the stomach. Recovery is usually rapid.

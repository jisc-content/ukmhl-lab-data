DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 213 of booklets, with sucking-cliscs; the large ripe seg- ments contain numerous and finely branching uterine arborizations with ova. The undeveloped form of the parasite lives in the muscles of cattle. 2. Taenia solium: head provided with crown of booklets and sucking-discs. The segments are less in breadth, width, and thickness than those of the preceding variety; the branches of the uterus are sparser and larger. The undeveloped form (cvsti- cercus cellulosae) lives in the muscles of the hog, ex- ceptionally also in various organs (brain, eye, and muscles) of man, so that this parasite endangers health both in its mature and in its undeveloped con- dition. 3. Bothriocephalus latus: head almond-shaped, with flat sucking-discs; the segments are broader than they are long. The rosette-sliaped uterus occupies the centre of the segments and is brownish in color. In water the ova change to a ciliated oncosphere which escapes from its shell and swims about. From this is developed, perhaps through the intervention of a secondary intermediate host, in fishes (particu- larly in the juke and in the burbot) a plerocercoid, 8-30 mm. long. 4. Ankylostomum duodenale (Doclimius duode- nalis), 8-18 mm. in length. In the bell-shaped oral capsule are hook-like teeth. This blood-sucking parasite lives in the duodenum and upper jejunum, and produces grave anaemia (Egyptian chlorosis); it is the cause of the minerâ€™s disease or Gotthard anae- mia, particularly in workmen occupied in tunnels, pits, and brickyards. The liberated ova change to larvae which are very resistant to external influences,

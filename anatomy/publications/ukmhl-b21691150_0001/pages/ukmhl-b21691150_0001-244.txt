110 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. for instance, eczema capitis, otitis, rhinitis, conjunc- tivitis, keratitis, blepharitis, pharyngitis—all of them chronic inflammatory processes which are character- ized by rebelliousness, long duration, and marked tendency to relapse. Such primary affections may also be altogether absent, just as cheesy tuberculosis of the bronchial glands in children and youths, whose pulmonary parenchyma is perfectly normal, is often met with. In similar cases the tuberculous virus may pass through the mucosa or the lung tissue without leaving a trace, but, finding in the paren- chyma of the lymphatic glands, conditions favorable to its increase it produces a primary glandular tuber- culosis (cryptogenic infection). While on the one hand the gland takes the part of a filter, on the other hand the tuberculous virus extends by preference to neighboring glands; owing to the blocking and occlu- sion of normal lymph channels there results frequently also a retrograde (paradoxical) centrifugal transpor- tion of the tuberculous virus, and thus are formed, as it were, cheesy bundles of glands the size of a hen’s egg and larger. Latent glandular tuberculosis, es- pecially about the root of the lung and in the medi- astinum, is extremely common in children between the first and sixth year of life dead of some other disease. By a regionary spread from such glands secondary miliary tuberculosis of neighboring organs often results; for instance, we sometimes observe ex- tension to the lungs from the intratlioracic glands (retrograde spread of the virus), or to the pleura or the pericardium; also from the mesenteric and retro- peritoneal glands to the peritoneum. Besides, ero- sion of vessels (pulmonary veins) may cause the

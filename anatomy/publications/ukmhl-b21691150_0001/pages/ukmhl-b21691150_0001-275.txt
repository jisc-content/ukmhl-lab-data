DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 141 and screaming, in laborious muscular exertion, forced marches, and inordinate mountain climbing. A long-standing bronchitis associated with impeded expiration favors the development of emphysema, and inversely the obliteration of the pulmonary capillaries causes a disposition to circulatory disturbances in the bronchial mucosa and a secondary bronchial catarrh. Great importance attaches to the sequelm of pul- monary emphysema upon the heart and the circula- tion. Owing to the obliteration of a portion of the pulmonary capillaries the blood is dammed back in the pulmonary arteries, the pressure in the right heart rises, and dilatation and compensatory hyper- trophy of the right ventricle and auricle ensue; finally, when the compensation is insufficient and the right heart flags—a condition which may be the cause of death—general venous congestion results. As iu cases of mitral stenosis we find evidences of chronic congestion, namely, nutmeg liver, cyanotic induration of the spleen and kidneys, congestive ca- tarrh of the stomach and intestines, moderate dropsy; in a word, when a fatal termination results from pul- monary emphysema, the death is due to the heart, not to the lungs. Interstitial or interlobular emphysema (Plate ‘24) is also produced by the tearing of the alveolar walls with the escape of air bubbles into the interlobular connective tissue of the lung. In the subpleural con- nective tissue and also upon the cut surface we ob- serve the air bubbles—usually from a pin’s head to a hempseed in size—arranged like a string of beads. In some cases the air may extend to the connective tissue at the root of the lung, to the mediastinum,

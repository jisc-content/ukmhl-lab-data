84 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. various degrees of insufficiency (valvular insuffi- ciency), witli or without stenosis, also develop. At the aortic valve additional factors favor the in- sufficiency caused by the valvular anomaly. Owing to the frequently coexistent and primary aortic scle- rosis (Plate 8) the ascending aorta is distended, caus- ing dilatation of the aortic ostium. The insufficiency resulting primarily from the moderate thickening and shortening of the semilunar valves is associated with a relative insufficiency, and thus we see before us a combined or potential valvular insufficiency, which is sometimes increased still more by the coexisting dila- tation of the left ventricle. Besides this accessory relative insufficiency there is a relative insufficiency which occurs rather fre- quently in consequence of dilatation of the right ven- tricle and auricle at the tricuspid valve. With the widening of the cavities and of the ring of attachment of the valve there are increasing tension and stretching of the leaflets, tendinous cords, and papillary muscles of the tricuspid valve until the latter at last is no longer able to close the ostium, which is sometimes dilated to double and treble the normal. A third form of insufficiency of the auriculo-ven- tricular valves is known as muscular; it is due to fatty degeneration or indurative metamorphosis of the papillary muscles and is met with secondarily in fatty degeneration of the heart muscle, which shows a special predilection for the papillary muscles and may attain marked degrees. It is found also in ame- nde and chlorotic patients in whom the nutrition of the heart muscle suffers. To this class belong the cases in which murmurs are audible during life and

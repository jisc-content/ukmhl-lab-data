116 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. roid gland (34 gm.=509 gr.) is somewhat larger than in women (30 gm. =463 gr.), jjrobably in harmony with the greater body weight of the former. The average weight in adults ranges between 36 and 50 gm.=555 and 771 gr. Inflammation of the normal (thyroiditis) or of the enlarged gland (strumitis) is not frequent; the infectious form sometimes occurs in connection with typhoid fever and diphtheria. Enlargement of the Thyroid Gland. Struma or Goitre. An enlarged thyroid gland is very frequently found in persons after puberty. In subjects between the eleventh and fiftieth years, dead of various diseases in Munich, the thyroid gland proved to be enlarged in nearly one-fourth (twenty-three per cent); in those over fifty, in more than one-half (fifty-six per cent). Women suffer from goitre more frequently than men (influence of pregnancy?). The majority of observers include every enlarge- ment of the thyroid gland among the neoplasms under the head of adenomaâ€”a view which seems to be based neither on histology nor on physiology; most of the enlarged thyroid glands are to be classed as true hypertrophies or hyperplasise. In hypertrophy of the thyroid gland (struma pa- renchymatosa sive liyperplastica) the organ appears uniformly enlarged, as much as double and treble the normal; in color, consistence, and minute structure it corresponds exactly with the normal gland. The en- largement develops slowly, and -when moderate causes hardly any disturbance. This group includes con-

As a result of the stenosis there are dilatation of the bowel above the tumor, sometimes associated with compensatory hypertrophy of the muscular tunic. Intestinal cancer often spreads to the peritoneum or to the neighboring organs, which are infiltrated by contiguity and destroyed. Thus cancer of the rec- tum may invade the vagina and uterus, the bladder in men (recto-vesical fistula), and the retroperitoneal pelvic connective tissue; secondary carcinosis of the mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphatic glands and of the liver is almost invariably observed. More fre- quently than in gastric cancer perforation into the peritoneal cavity and terminal purulent perforation peritonitis come under observation. Parasites of the Intestine. Aside from a few specific microparasitic organisms (tubercle, typhoid, and cholera bacilli), the great majority of vegetable occupants of the intestine be- longs to the saprophytes which only occasional^ assume pathogenic properties (facultative parasites), especially and most dangerously when they are en- abled, by reason of nutritive, circulatory, or destruc- tive influences, to penetrate into the tissue of the in- testinal wall or into the peritoneal cavity. Por animal parasites the intestinal canal forms a special site of predilection. Among the tape worms there are three species which find their habitat in the small intestine of man: 1.

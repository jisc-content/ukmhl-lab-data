133 DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN'S. rounding pulmonary parenchyma (hypertrophic bron- chiectasis, Plate 22), to the traction exerted by the gradually expanding pulmonary tissue during the ab- sorption of a pleuritic exudate upon the peribronchial connective tissue, upon the connective-tissue sheath of the bronchus. Besides, accumulated exudates ob- viously favor the dilatation of the bronchi, while the distention in turn of course hinders the prompt evac- uation of the secretion and favors the accumulation of muco-purulent inflammatory products. In the ma- jority of cases, particularly those of which primary changes of the walls form the main cause, the wall, especially the cartilaginous and glandular portion of the dilated bronchi, is atrophic (atrophic bronchi- ectasis). With reference to the localization it may be remarked that the inferior lobe is more frequently the seat of bronchiectasis than are the upper and middle lobes; at the apex of the lung bronchiectases of slight extent (from the size of a pea to that of a cherry) are more frequent in connection with indurated and cica- tricial processes (apical tuberculosis). Bronchiecta- sis is usually associated with intractable chronic bronchitis, and occasionally we observe the develop- ment of a fetid bronchitis with a tendency to fatal general infection (septicaemia). DISEASES OF THE LUNG. Among the circulatory disturbances of the lung, one of the most frequent and important is venous or congestive hypercemia (Plate 23). This develops when the efflux of the blood from the pulmonary veins into the left auricle is interfered with (in valvular defects

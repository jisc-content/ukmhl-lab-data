DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 171 When of long standing the layers of the pleura are in- variably in a state of fibrous thickening, opaque, and covered with a pyogenic fibrino-purulent deposit. Purulent pleurisy is observed particularly in pulmo- nary tuberculosis and after malignant pneumonias and abscess of the lung. Perforation into the lung aud into a bronchus may follow, rarely perforation outward; recovery ensues frequently after thoraco- centesis and is markedly favored by operative re- moval of the exudate (resection of ribs). The radical operation is followed by recovery in from fifty to eighty per cent of the cases. A variety of purulent pleurisy is sanious pleurisy (putrid empyema); the exudate is fetid and contains without exception germs of decomposition besides the pyogenic fungi. Purulent exudates may occasion- ally remain present for months; the exudation be- comes insjnssated and changed into a cheesy mass. In that event the layers of the pleura are usually enormously thickened, forming a stiff, board-like, sometimes calcified envelope around the masses of exudate. Every exudative pleurisy causes secondary alterations of the surrounding organs, among which partial or total atelectasis and consequent functional impairment of the luug occupy the front rank. With moderate masses of exudate the inferior and posterior segments of the lung are chiefly compressed and ate- lectatic ; with abundant exudates the lung, reduced to the diameter of a small hand, lies in the shape of a flat cake-like mass upward and inward upon the root of the lung and is entirely without air. The inter- costal spaces bulge outward, the diaphragm protrudes downward, the mediastinum and the pericardium are

117 THYROID GLAND. genital goitre, which is observed now and then in newly born children, the lateral lobes of the gland at- taining the size of a walnut and larger. Diffuse (interacinous) adenoma of the thyroid gland is characterized by abundant formation and deposition of colloid material and by round-cell infil- tration of the supporting tissue. When in this alter- ation of the glandular substance there is an accumu- lation of larger colloid masses in the form of glossy, gelatinous spheres and drops, the condition is known as colloid or gelatinous struma; either the entire gland or some of its parts may be thus affected. At the same time there is frequently a tendency to the formation of cysts (cystadenoma, struma cystica); the gland follicles filled with colloid masses becom- ing dilated into cysts containing not only colloid and gelatinous but also, when large, a sanguineous fluid of a dirty brownish-red color (struma cystica hemor- rhagica) . The cyst wall, which is sometimes identi- cal with the capsule of the gland, is thickened, often hard, stiff, and partly calcified. With abundant development of vessels, which even in the normal gland are characterized by their size and calibre, the variety known as struma vasculosa results; with predominance of the arteries, struma aneurysmatica; with that of the veins, struma vari- cosa. When marked proliferation of the interstitial con- nective tissue is chiefly at fault in the enlargement of the gland, struma fibrosa or fibrous goitre results; the soft glandular parenchyma with a moist lustre is replaced by a firm fibrous mass.

The male may reach 25 cm., the female 40 cm. in length. Habitat in the small intestine. It is one of the most common para- sites, particularly in children, and is more frequent in the country than in cities. The worms may be present in small or large numbers. Under favorable conditions (moisture and heat) the liberated ova de- velop to the embryonic stage in from four to six weeks; such partly developed ova reach the digestive tract with the drinking-water or direct from the ground and attain their maturity in the body. 6. Oxyuris vermicularis (thread or seat worm). The male may reach 5 mm.; the female, which is far more numerous, 10 mm. in length. These worms are very frequent in children and adults, in the ctecum and adjoining colon; they pass with the faeces into the lower rectum, leave the anus especially during rest in bed, and cause annoying sensations. The ova reach the intestinal canal by adhering to the fin- gers or food substances (raw fruit); auto-infection is very frequent. 7. Trichoceplialus dispar (whip worm), 4-5 cm. in length. The thread-like anterior extremity (f of the entire length) is joined to a thick posterior extremity. The parasite is present in small numbers in the caecum and colon. Infection is direct, without an interme- diate host, by the ingestion of ova in the embryonal stage. Only exceptionally does it cause any symp- toms. 8. Trichina spiralis. Male 1.5 mm., female 3-4 mm. in length. Habitat, the small intestine of man

199 DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. mary, especially malignant tumors occur in the in- testine as they do in the stomach, but more rarely. A group of infectious diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery, is located primarily in the intestinal mucosa; tuberculosis likewise is very fre- quent, though as a rule only secondarily. Among the circulatory disturbances the most fre- quent form is congestive hypersemia which occurs with diseases of the liver, thrombosis of the portal vein, and affections of the heart. The mucous mem- brane is dark bluish-red, swollen, very succulent, and friable; the contents are often mixed with blood; abundant gray, glassy masses of mucus cover the mucosa (chronic congestive catarrh). In embolic or thrombotic occlusion of the mesenteric arterial twigs we note the development, often over large segments of the intestine, of a hemorrhagic infarction with effusion of blood into the lumen of the affected por- tion. Pronounced acute congestive hypermmia in cir- cumscribed segments of the intestine occurs regularly in incarceration, owing to the occlusion by compres- sion of the efferent mesenteric veins; this is often very rapidly followed by a sero-sanguinolent transu- dation into the hernial sac and into the lumen of the intestine. Inflammation of the Intestine, Intestinal Catarrah, Enteritis. This occurs in so many forms and gradations that a comprehensive description is hardly possible. Catarrhal enteritis or intestinal catarrh varies from a slight catarrh to a true inflammation and is either

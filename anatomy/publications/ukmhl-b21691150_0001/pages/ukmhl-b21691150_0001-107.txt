Explanation of Plate 31. Acute Tuberculous Sero-fibrinous and Hemor- rhagic Pleurisy. The left pleural sac contains about three litres (quarts) of a sero-sanguinolent fluid. The lung is greatly dimin- ished in size. The pleura is covered with delicate, red- dish discolored, fibrinous deposits. After their removal we observe numerous miliary gray nodules (miliary tubercles) on the pleura. At the apex of the lung— probably the starting-point of the tuberculous pleurisy —is a cheesy tuberculous focus which is evidently older. In the parenchyma of the lung (visible through the pleura to the left posteriorly) miliary tubercles are also present in moderate quantities. Other lesions found in the patient, aged fifty-nine years (No. 7, 1895), were chronic fibrous endocarditis of the aortic valves, cirrhosis of the liver, induration of the kidneys and spleen, with considerable swelling of the latter. 31

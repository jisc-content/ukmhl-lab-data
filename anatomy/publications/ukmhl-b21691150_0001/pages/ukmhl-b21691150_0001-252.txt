118 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. the indurated fibrous parts gives rise to struma calculosa. All these various forms may be combined in differ- ent ways; thus we may find fibrous follicular forms, cystic goitre with calcareous deposits, effusions of blood—usually degenerative forms of goitre. The adenoid neoplastic nature of goitre is besides clearly manifested by those forms which are known as nodular and are characterized by the fact that the enlarged gland contains circumscribed round nodules of different size (from a pea to a cherry and even half a hen’s egg) and lighter color, consisting of embry- onal glandular tissue. Such glands are most fre- quently found in young subjects. When of long standing, the various forms of goitre often attain a large size, that of a fist and even a child’s head. In such a case they exert great pres- sure upon surrounding organs, especially the trachea, which is narrowed, thus impeding respiration and causing a tendency to dyspnoea. Lateral compres- sion of the trachea gives rise to the so-called sword- slieath form of the latter. When the growth is downward, the strumous masses penetrate behind the manubrium sterni (struma sub- sternalis), where the room is limited, so that the lower segments of the trachea are seriously compressed and grave disturbances arise. Sudden death, usually by arrest of respiration, is not unusual in the larger forms of goitre. The enlargement of the thyroid gland is at times associated with hypertrophy of the heart and exopli- thalmus (exophthalmic goitre); this peculiar symp- tom complex, which is combined with numerous other,

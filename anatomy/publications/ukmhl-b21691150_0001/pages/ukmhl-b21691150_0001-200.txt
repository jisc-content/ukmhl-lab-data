66 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. and then in connection with ichorous and cancerous processes which have extended from adjoining struc- tures, for instance, with cancer of the oesophagus, sloughing inflammation of the mediastinal lymphatic glands, or when foreign bodies (pieces of bone) pene- trate from the oesophagus into the pericardium. Tuberculosis of the Pericardium. Tuberculosis of the pericardium occurs either as acute disseminated miliary tuberculosis or as tuber- culous inflammation; in the former variety the mili- ary tubercles are found deposited chiefly at the base and along the vessels. Tuberculous pericarditis frequently causes at the same time an eruption of tubercles and a fibrinous hemorrhagic exudate; after detaching the delicate or massive, reddish colored, fibrinous deposits, the mili- ary tubercles are found in the injected serosa. Tuberculous pericarditis occurs chiefly in old per- sons and in children; in the latter especially in con- nection with tuberculosis of the intrathoracic glands. Hydropericardium. (Dropsy of the Heart.) There is an accumulation of a watery, clear, wine- colored fluid in the pericardial sac, which is corre- spondingly dilated. The slighter grades (15-30 c.c. =fl. 3 ss.-i. of fluid) are quite frequent; more pro- nounced cases (80-100-200 c.c. =fl. 3 iiss.-iii.-vi.) are found in at least ten to fifteen per cent of all autop- sies. The serosa in this condition is smooth, glossy, and transparent.

67 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. Hydropericardium develops in numerous diseases of the heart and lungs, in hydrsemic conditionsâ€” tuberculosis, carcinoma, chronic nephritis, or as a concomitant state in general dropsy. ELemopericardium . A pericardial effusion of blood in variable amount is found most frequently with gnnsliot and stall wounds of the pericardium and heart, with sponta- neous rupture of the heart, and with perforation of an aneurism of the aorta into the pericardium. DISEASES OF THE HEART MUSCLE. Hypertrophy and Dilatation. The normal heart of an adult man is said to corre- spond in its circumference to about the size of his fist. The heart is considered to be hypertrophied when its bulk exceeds the maximum which may be attained by the most powerful physiological work (hard labor, vigorous muscles of the body). The relative weight of the heart (proportion of the weight of the heart to that of the body) in a healthy person is as 1 : 200; with a medium weight of the body of 60 kgm.=132 lb., that of the heart is about 300 gm.=10^ oz. The hypertrophy is either diffuse, involving the entire heart, or it affects only certain portions, for instance, the right ventricle and auricle alone, or it is confined to the left ventricle. The causes are usually mechanical, for instance, valvular defects or disturbances in the lesser circula-

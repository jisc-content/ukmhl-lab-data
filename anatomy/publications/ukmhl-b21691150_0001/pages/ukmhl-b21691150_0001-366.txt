Cirrhosis of the Liver. (Plate 55, Pig. a.) This occurs in two principal forms: 1. Atrophic cirrhosis, granular cirrhosis (Laen- nec). The liver is markedly diminished in size, the surface is granulated with coarse and fine tuberosi- ties, the color is yellowish or pale grayish-yellow, and the tissue creaks under the knife. On the cut surface we notice that the sustentacular tissue is ir- regularly and profusely proliferated; between the whitish masses of connective tissue appear the irreg- ularly shrunken acini, which are more intensely yel- low or icteric in color and often infiltrated with fat. The microscope reveals a periportal interacinous con- nective-tissue proliferation. Owing to the oblitera- tion of branches of the portal vein there is a secondary stasis in the distribution of that vessel, i.e., conges- tive enlargement of the spleen, chronic catarrh of the stomach and intestine, and finally ascites; the ob- literation and constriction of bile ducts cause moder- ate icterus. 2. More rarely we observe hypertrophic cirrhosis of the liver (pseudo-hypertrophy), the organ being frequently enlarged to one and two-thirds of the normal, sometimes to double and treble the usual bulk. The surface with few exceptions is smooth, the tissue usually richer in blood than normal; under

203 DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. appendix, where faecal concretions (coproliths) set up necrosis of the mucosa and the rest of the intestinal wall and finally cause perforative appendicitis (Plate 47, Figs, a and b). Similar processes, though they terminate more rarely in perforation, are occasionally found in the caecum (typhlitis and perityphlitis). As regards the sequelae of ulcerative appendicitis the following are evidently the determining elements: the situation and attachment of the vermiform appendix, the nature of the necrosing factor (mechanical and benign, or infectious and malignant) and hence the rapidity of the perforation; in other words, the more rapid the destruction and perforation of the wall of the appendix the less time is given for adhesion and encapsulation of the local process and the more quickly will dangerous diffuse peritonitis develop. After inflammatory processes of various kinds we find rather frequently in adult cadavers a partial or complete obliteration of the vermiform apendix. Now and then we may discover, as at other points of the bowel, purulent and sanious periappendicitis (perityphlitis) without perforation of the appendix, in which cases septic germs emigrate through the diseased intestinal wall. Finally, chronic inflammations of the intestine occur sometimes about the rectum and assume very different forms. Ulcerative processes are met with along with hypertrophy of the mucous membrane (proliferating and stenosing proctitis), thickening of the muscular tunic and the adjoining soft parts, which are often undermined with fistula?, especially toward the anus and perineum; at the same time we some- times find fistulous passages, in women the formation

90 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. The sequelae of arteriosclerosis are very mani- fold. Owing to the loss of elasticity and contractility, the arterial pressure rises, with secondary dilatation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle; the diseased ves- sels show a tendency to a diffuse and circumscribed dilatation of the lumen, to the formation of aneu- risms; the degenerative processes (fatty degenera- tion) are apt to cause rupture, especially apoplexies in the brain. In the medium-sized and smaller ar- teries the lumen becomes contracted and thrombi form, with nutritive disturbances of the peripheral organs â€”arteriosclerotic atrophy of the brain and of the kidneys. A special importance attaches to sclerosis with fatty degeneration of the cephalic vessels, which gives rise to presenile atrophy of the brain, to ne- crotic and localized softening of the brain substance; in sclerosis of the renal arteries we find maculated contraction of the kidneys; in sclerosis of the arteries of the lower extremities senile gangrene is apt to oc- cur ; sclerosis of the coronary arteries causes atrophic and inflammatory alterations of the heart muscle with serious functional disturbances (angina pectoris s. stenocardia). Furthermore, in ulcerative and cal- careous inflammation of the intima of the larger ar- teries we observe a special tendency to the formation of parietal thrombi, which in turn cause embolism of the peripheral arteries. The connection between arteriosclerosis and cardiac hypertrophy may vary as follows: (1) The arterio- of this disease was forty-seven years, that of the women fifty- four years.

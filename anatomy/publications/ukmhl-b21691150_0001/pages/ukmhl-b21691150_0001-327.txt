When perforation threatens while the ulcerative process invades the muscular tunic, a reactive and adhesive circumscribed perito- Fig. 18.â€”Stellate Cicatrix of the Stomach. A healed round ulcer. Start- ing from the whitish opaque centre, the seat of the original ulcer, we ob- serve numerous radial processes in fine folds. At the point of the healed ulcer the wall of the stomach is somewhat thinned and faintly translucent when held up to the light. nitis (perigastritis) sometimes occurs on the corre- sponding point of the peritoneum, with resulting ag- glutination of the danger spot to surrounding organs, especially to the pancreas and to the retroperito- neal connective tissue. While the margins directed toward the peritoneal cavity are loosely or intimately adherent, the ulcer may penetrate into the aggluti- nated organs and cause considerable losses of sub- stance, until at last, owing to an unfortunate accident 13

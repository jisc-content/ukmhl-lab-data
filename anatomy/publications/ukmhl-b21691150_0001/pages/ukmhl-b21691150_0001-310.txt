Digestive Apparatus. DISEASES OF THE ORAL CAVITY AND OF THE TONGUE. Hemorrhages of the oral mucous membrane are frequently observed, especially from the gums in scurvy and haemophilia or the hemorrhagic diathesis. Inflammatory processes (stomatitis) occur in vari- ous forms and gradations: Desquamative or catarrhal stomatitis, with abun- dant proliferation and desquamation of the epithe- lia and increased secretion of mucus. The mucous membrane appears swollen, reddened in spots and streaks; the papillae are more prominent than normal. The causes are mechanical, thermal, and chemical irritations, the eruption of teeth, acute infectious dis- eases (measles, scarlatina, small-pox), inflammations, especially of the pharynx, which have extended to the oral mucosa. Chronic catarrhal stomatitis, usually associated with chronic pharyngeal catarrh, in drinkers and ex- cessive smokers. There are grayish-white spots of thickening on the mucous membrane, a tough mucous secretion, and a whitish coating of the tongiTe, with an abundant development of fungi (leptothrix buc- calis). Stomato-mycosis (thrush), caused by a mould fungus (oidium albicans). This is a superficial

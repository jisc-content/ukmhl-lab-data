The liver as a whole, how- ever, is always diminished in size; its characteristic shape is destroyed, the sharp margins are usually blunted, the capsule is covered with connective-tissue adhesions (perihepatitis adhsesiva). Owing to the connective-tissue sclerosis, especially at the porta .of the liver and in the neighborhood of the branches of the portal vein, there are generally the same circula- tory disturbances as in atrophic cirrhosis, namely, ascites, splenic tumor, and congestive catarrh of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane. Neoplasms of the Liver. (Plate 60.) Of occasional occurrence in the liver are cavernous angioma, very rarely sarcoma (hemorrhagic angio- sarcoma), and adenoma. By far the most frequent neoplasm is carcinoma, which is only exceptionally primary, but occurs more often than in any other organ secondarily and meta- statically. Primary carcinoma of the liver forms large tuber- cles (from the size of a fist to that of a childâ€™s head) around which smaller nodules are visible; besides the tubercular form infiltrated carcinoma is met with, when the tissue contains insular cancer nests resem- bling the residues of liver tissue in cirrhosis of the organ. Metastatic cancer occurs in the form of multiple tubercles which are usually almost uniformly distrib- uted through the parenchyma and subperitoneally, and is especially frequent in primary carcinoma of

THYROID GLAND. 113 nition of the same epithelial elements as those of the organ primarily affected. Cancerous lymphatic glands are always swollen, the cut surface is often medullary and whitish or grayish-white in color; sometimes we also find retrograde metamorphoses of the carcinomatous proliferations, such as fatty degen- eration, softening, necrosis, and hemorrhage. As in tuberculosis, the lymphatic glands retard the spread of the cancerous disease, at least for a time. Owing to the blocking of the physiological channels, collat- eral and retrograde passages may develop and thus again give rise to metastases; in this manner, with uterine carcinoma, after occlusion of the retroperi- toneal and other glands the inguinal or mesenteric lymphatic glands may be found in cancerous degener- ation. Very rarely, excepting in lymplio-scaroma and me- lanotic sarcoma, we find metastatic sarcomatous dis- ease of the lymphatic glands; metastasis in sarcoma is effected by preference through the blood-vessels. DISEASES OF THE THYROID GLAND. The thyroid gland is an organ which is indispen- sable to life, especially during the developmental pe- riod ; it is a true gland, whose epithelia furnish a spe- cific secretion (thyroidin) that is distributed through the lymph channels. When formed in excess or when its efflux is impeded, the secretion accumulates in the gland follicles in the shape of colloid masses. Extirpation of the thyroid gland is borne by some animals, it is said, without danger to life, while dogs succumb. In man, after complete removal of the 8

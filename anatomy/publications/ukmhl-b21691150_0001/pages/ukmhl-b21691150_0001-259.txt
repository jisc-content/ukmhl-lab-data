DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 125 tuberculosis. The ulcers begin as a rule in the region of the posterior point of attachment of the vocal cords and gradually extend downward; after the perichon- drium is destroyed the cartilage may become ne- crosed. The ulcers look eroded and pale; at the bottom and the margins yellowish-white nodules are sometimes visible; the margins are usually markedly tumid and consist of proliferated epithelial masses. Kecent ulcers are shallow, the older lesions deeper and excavated. The healing of such ulcers is cer- tainly quite rare. Tuberculosis of the larynx arises by way of intrabronchial and intratracheal auto- infection, from transportation of the infectious bron- chial and pulmonary secretion; the stagnation of portions of the sputa in the depressions of the larynx favors the local infection. The rarity of laryngeal tuberculosis in children probably depends on the lesser frequency of cavities in the lungs and the more rapid course of the disease in young subjects. Syphilis of the larynx occurs either in diffuse patches of infiltration of the mucous membrane (mu- cous patches) or in the form of excavated ulcers, located usually on the vocal cords, at the posterior wall of the larynx, and on the margins of the epiglot- tis. The ulcers have a lardaceous, yellowish-white bottom and tumid margins; along with them we occa- sionally find flat nodular gummata, irregular cica- trices, purulent perichondritis, and necrosis of the cartilage. Neoplasms of the Larynx. The neoplasms of the larynx (polypi) belong in the large majority of cases among the connective-tissue tumors. Their sites of predilection are the true vocal

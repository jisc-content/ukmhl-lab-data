Explanation of Plate 15. Embolic Infarctions of the Spleen with En- gorgement of the Organ. In the spleen, enlarged by engorgement to more than double its normal size, are found several irregularly shaped foci of an orange-yellow color which are sharply demarcated from the surrounding tissue. These foci are depressed below the level of the surface, evidently by reason of a gradual contraction and absorption. On section it is seen that the form of the foci is usually that of a wedge whose point is directed toward the hilus. The foci are dry, lustreless, and friable, in a condition of coagulation necrosis. Here and there the foci are surrounded by radiating arborescent processes. The re- maining parenchyma of the organ is in a condition of cyanotic induration and chronic hyperplasia (chronic splenic engorgement). The immediate cause of the splenic infarctions, which are evidently several weeks or months old, is found in embolic occlusions of various branches of the splenic arteries. At the autopsy of the patient, aged twenty-three years (No. 97, 1888), the starting-point of the splenic emboli was found in a recurrent verrucose endocarditis of the aortic and mitral valves; there were also considerable hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart (weight, 500 gm. = 17| oz., with a body weight of 37.5 kgm. = S3 lb.). The kidneys contained similar older infarctions of smaller size; in the left cerebrum, in the region of the island of Reil and about the third frontal convolution, was another embolic softened area larger than a henâ€™s egg (about four weeks old, judging from the clinical symptoms), caused by embolic occlusion of the left arteria pro fossa Sylvii. The benign condition of the embolic areas justifies the conclusion that the primary valvular disease of the heart was not of an infectious nature, although some defects of the inflamed valves would suggest a mycotic ulcerative origin of the inflammation. 15

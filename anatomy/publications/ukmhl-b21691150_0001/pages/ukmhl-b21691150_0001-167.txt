Explanation of Plate 51. Carcinosis of the Peritoneum. Upon the peritoneum which shows a greenish discolor- ation1' are numerous flat nodules of a whitish color, the majority the size of a leutil or pea. The abdominal cav- ity contained about 1^ litres (quarts) of a serous amber- colored liquid (ascites). The omentum (not visible in the plate) showed a marked cancerous infiltration, form- ing a misshapen, tumid, and lobulated mass with diffuse bloody infiltration and covered with numerous whitish nodules. The location of the primary carcinoma of the patient, aged forty-three years (No. 190, 1894), was in the ovaries. The layers of the pleura presented a similar appearance to that in the abdominal cavityâ€”disseminated cancerous nodules with hemorrhagic exudation. Associated condi- tions noted were chronic parenchymatous nephritis, fatty liver, and anasarca of the lower extremities. *The intense greenish discoloration of the peritoneum became more pronounced after death. 51

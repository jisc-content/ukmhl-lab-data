Upon the surface of the tongue and on the palate we observe white, at first insular, later con- fluent membranes; the epithelial layer on the affected points is thickened and penetrated by mycelia and spores. The pseudo-membranes are at first easily detached, later with difficulty. As a rule, the fungus does not pass beyond the epithelium. Stomatitis vesiculosa, pustulosa, et aphthosa. An inflammation of the oral cavity associated with the formation of vesicles, pustules, and ulcers, observed now and then in small-pox, varicella, and when the poison of the foot-and-mouth disease of cattle is transmitted by the ingestion of the unboiled milk of animals affected with that disease. Purulent stomatitis in the form of circumscribed focal processes in the gums in connection with cari- ous teeth is more frequently observed.

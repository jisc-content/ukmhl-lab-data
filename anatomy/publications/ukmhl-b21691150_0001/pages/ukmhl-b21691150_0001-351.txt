Acquired umbilical hernia is most frequent in corpulent per- sons and in women who have borne many children. Quite an extensive variety is hernia of the umbilical cord, the funis dilating and receiving intestines when the abdomen is fissured. Among the rare forms are sciatic hernia (protrusion of the peritoneum through the sciatic notch) and her- nia through the obturator or oval foramen. Dia- phragmatic hernia is not a true hernia but a prolapse of abdominal contents into the left pleural cavity through a defect in the diaphragm; it may be con- genital or acquired after a trauma (fall from a height). Internal herniae so-called (Treitz’s hernia) are char- acterized by the fact that the intestine is displaced through preformed pockets of the peritoneal wall. Such retroperitoneal herniae occur very rarely, for instance, at the foramen of Winslow, in the subcaecal fossa. A hernia of the intestinal wall (Littre’s hernia) is present when only one side of the intestinal wall lies in the hernial sac as a diverticular protrusion. Herniae are among the frequent affections; two and a half to three per cent of all persons are suffering from them; by reason of numerous exciting causes they are found more than four times as often in men as in women. Herniae are more frequent on the right than on the left side; sometimes they are bilateral. The hernial contents vary greatly in bulk and an- atomical character; besides the intestine with the corresponding mesentery we often find portions of the great omentum which are rich in fat, almost lipo-

DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 209 large statistics show that in one-half of all fatal cases it is in the third and fourth weeks, in twenty-five per cent in the second and fifth weeks, only in two and a half per cent in the first week, and in the remainder (more than twenty per cent) after the fifth week. The mortality varies greatly, in good hospitals it may be as low as eight to ten to twelve per cent, while for- merly (thirty to forty years ago) it was as much as twenty-five per cent. Cholera. The morbid process is confined mainly to the small intestine. In the first or algid stage the intestine is intensely reddened, of a rosy color; the wall is friable, greatly swollen, the mucous membrane in particular, owing to a serous infiltration. The follicles are generally swollen. The lumen contains a light gray, abundant fluid mixed with flakes and resembling rice water. As the biliary secretion of the liver is arrested, the fluid is almost colorless and odorless, of alkaline re- action and watery, containing only from one to two per cent of solids. The flakes consist of desquamated epithelial shreds (desquamative enteritis). In the second stage (cholera typhoid) the intestinal contents are sparse and catarrhal alterations can still be demonstrated. Owing to the partial denudation of the mucosa there are a croupous exudation, eschar formation, and diphtheroid enteritis; transverse ulcers extending deep into the wall of the bowel are left behind. The admixture of bile again stains the contents a dark green, brown, or yellowish color. During the first six or seven days comma bacilli 14

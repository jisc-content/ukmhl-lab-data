DISEASES OF THE LIVEK. 235 usually large, reaching the size of an adult head. Each consists of a mother cyst with chitin layer, a parenchyma layer upon which the scolices are situ- ated, and generally contains numerous daughter cysts, i.e., endogenous echinococcus. A special vari- ety is the multilocular or alveolar echinococcus, which forms tumid masses of board-like hardness the size of a childâ€™s or even an adult head; in the centre is usually a cavity with eroded walls. A fibrous frame- work with few cells contains the folded and irregu- larly distributed chitin vesicles with or without scolices. Syphilis of the Liver. (Plates 57, 58, and 59.) Aside from diffuse interstitial hepatitis which some- times develops in consequence of syphilis, either soon after infection or many years later as an after-effect, and is met with especially as the hypertrophic form in congenital syphilis of the newly born, syphilis occasionally gives rise to a serious visceral disease, a peculiar form of interstitial hepatitis, in which the proliferation of the fibrous tissue is so localized that the liver is markedly deformed (hepatitis interstitialis deformans). Thus irregular larger and smaller lobes are formed (Plate 57), which are separated by deep indentations and fissures (large-lobed liver). Very often these firm fibrous trabeculae spring from the suspensory ligament; this frequently contains scat- tered yellowish, necrotic, firmly elastic nodules (gum- mata), i.e., interstitial gummous hepatitis (Plates 58 and 59). The partial inflammatory atrophy often leads to compensatory irregular hypertrophy ot

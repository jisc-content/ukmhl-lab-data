Explanation of Plate 50. Subchronic and Subacute Tuberculosis of the Peritoneum. The peritoneal investment of the intestine and mesen- tery is injected here and there and shows some inflam- matory thickening. Situated upon it are numerous nodules, ranging in size from a pinâ€™s head to a pea or bean, yellowish-white in color and partly somewhat flat- tened ; some of them are composed of an agglomeration of several smaller ones. The nodules bear a close re- semblance to metastatic cancerous proliferations. The patient, aged fifty-four years, suffered from a primary genital tuberculosis of the uterus and tubes, so that the peritoneal tuberculosis can be almost certainly ascribed to the disease of the Fallopian tubes. There were also found tuberculous ulcers in the colon and a local tuberculosis of the left lung (No. 383, 1895). 50

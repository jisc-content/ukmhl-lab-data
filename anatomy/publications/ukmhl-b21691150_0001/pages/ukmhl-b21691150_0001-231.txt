One of the most frequent anomalies of the veins is dilatation, phlebectasia. As a rule we have to deal with disease of entire venous plexuses, whose arborizations appear dilated and tortuous, with nodular distentions and saccula- tions like diverticula of the walls. The media of the wall is alternately hypertrophied and atrophied, the intima is evenly thickened by a kind of fibrous endo- phlebitis. Veins thus affected frequently show a ten- dency to rupture and hemorrhage from slight causes. The causes of the dilatation of the veins are mani- fold. Aside from hereditary tendency, we distin- guish central causes, diseases of the heart (weakness of the heart), lungs, pleura, and liver; and peripheral causes, compression of large venous trunks by tu- mors, by the pregnant uterus, by the accumulation of fecal masses, unsuitable and constricting articles of dress, and insufficient muscular activity. As a result of the dilatation of the veins there are retardation of the circulation, stasis, and the forma- tion of thrombi; the mucous membranes within the domain of the affected part are subject to chronic catarrhs owing to the defective venous return flow; the external skin, especially that of the legs and feet, is liable to chronic inflammatory processes with ex- cessive deposit of pigment and has a tendency to the formation of ulcers (varicose ulcers). 7

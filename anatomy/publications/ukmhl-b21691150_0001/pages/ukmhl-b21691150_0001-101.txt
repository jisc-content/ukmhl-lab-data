Explanation of Plate 29. Subacute Cheesy Tuberculosis of the Lung. Nearly the whole upper lobe is of a firm, liver-like consistence; the tissue is devoid of air and hard to cut; the surface of the section has a pretty uniform yellow- ish-white color and is friable and crumbly. Near the top, between the coalescing cheesy infiltrated lobules, we still observe some reddish colored traces of aerated tissue; at other points there is besides a commencing ulcerating and cavernous disintegration. In the lower lobe there are only some isolated, irregular cheesy foci, ranging in size from a hempseed to half a bean. At the root of the lung is a slate-colored peri- bronchial lymph gland in the parenchyma of which are embedded some cheesy tuberculous foci. 29

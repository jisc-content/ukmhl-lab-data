ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 80 form of parietal thrombi (thrombo-enclocarditis). Owing to the destructive and ulcerative tendency, the affected portions break down or the valves are abnormally distended and bulging, with the forma- tion of an acute aneurism and a tendency of the valves to break down and to become perforated. The throm- botic deposits likewise, by reason of their mycotic infiltration, present a discolored, dull gray, and greenish-gray appearance; they are very brittle and, like the rest of the destroyed valves, easily give rise to emboli. The infectious and ulcerative process has, more- over, a tendency to extend to the adjoining regions; secondary purulent and ulcerative myocarditis and pericarditis are often observed, and are particularly apt to spring from the aortic valves. Besides the local functional disturbance in the form of insufficiency and stenosis of the valves, we observe multiple embolic processes in the peripheral organs of the body, espe- cially in the spleen and the kidneys; in short, the clinical and anatomical picture of embolic septico- pyemia. The process generally ends fatally, more rarely there is a tendency to a subacute and chronic course; in the latter case intermissions and exacerbations occur almost regularly. Rheumatic endocarditis, met with as a local mani- festation of acute articular rheumatism, is evidently' also infectious in its origin, and should perhaps be described as a septiform inflammation. In view of the largely benign course of acute polyarthritis, such cases of valvular disease are extremely rare on the post-mortem table; more frequently we observe, after

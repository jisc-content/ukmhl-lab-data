Purulent or infectious myocarditis is comparatively rare; in embolic septico-pysemia the heart muscle is sometimes interspersed with miliary abscesses. Now and then an ulcerative necrosing myocarditis starts from the heart valves when a similar malignant process has become localized upon them. Fatty Heart. This is met with in different forms, i.e., as fatty degeneration of the muscle or as an excessive deposit of fat in the subepicardial connective tissue with pro- liferation of fat cells (fat-containing connective-tissue cells) between the atrophying muscular elements— fatty infiltration of the muscle. Fatty Degeneration of the Heart. Fatty degeneration of the heart muscle develops sometimes very rapidly in acute poisoning (with phosphorus), when it may attain great intensity in a few days. More frequently it arises gradually; at first it usually occurs in patches which by degrees spread diffusely. The subendocardial and subepi- cardial segments of the heart muscle are as a rule most seriously involved. It is useful to distinguish three grades: (1) Slight fatty degeneration. While the trans- verse striation is preserved we observe a deposition of minute fat droplets and granules in moderate quan- tities. This variety is found in many acute and

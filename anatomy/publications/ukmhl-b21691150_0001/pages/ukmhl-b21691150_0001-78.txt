Explanation of Plate 22. Bronchiectasis and Cirrhosis of the Lung. The tissue at the apex of the lung over an area the size of half a fist is sclerosed and crossed by irregularly and markedly dilated bronchioles. The walls of the latter are thickened and pass imperceptibly into the sur- rounding cirrhotic tissue, which exceptionally does not present the usual slaty discoloration. The condensed portion is sharply demarcated from the surrounding healthy lung tissue, only a gradually diminishing con- nective-tissue cord is seen extending toward the root of the lung. 22

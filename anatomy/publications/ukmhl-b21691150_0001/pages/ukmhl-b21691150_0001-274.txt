ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 140 alveolar septa and tlieir compression fi’om two sides; tlie associated tension of the vascular network pro- duces stretching and narrowing of the vessels and impeded circulation. As a result of the excessive tension and traction upon the meshes of the vessels the latter are so much narrowed that they finally ad- mit the passage of serum only, which is insufficient for the nutrition of the vascular tissue. The capil- lary network becomes partly obliterated, the epithe- lium undergoes fatty change, the elastic elements give way and disappear; in this manner is produced a partial erosion of the septa, the development of defects which enlarge steadily until at last two or more septa coalesce. The thinning of the septa proceeds pro- gressively with the increase in circumference of the alveoli. This rarefaction and atrophy of the pulmo- nary framework, which is started by the obliteration of vessels, is bound to develop more rapidly and more easily in ill-nourished and young subjects in whom the nutritive and physical conditions of the lung pre- sent a greater predisposition. This applies also in part to senile emphysema, in which the primary atro- phy of the pulmonary tissue without general enlarge- ment of the volume of the lung plays the main part, and in which a normal or slightly increased pressure is liable to change the insufficiently nourished pul- monary tissue in a manner similar to that described above. The statements here made will explain whjr the pure form of mechanical emphysema—as it were a professional affection—is found by preference in persons who subject their lungs to excessive, pro- longed, and oft-repeated strain, e.c/., in the playing of wind instruments, in long-continued loud speaking

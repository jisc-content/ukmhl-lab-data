Explanation of Plate 56. Acutk Miliary Tuberculosis of the Liver. (Natural size.) Scattered through the dark brownish-red liver tissue are numerous, minute, punctiform nodules of a gray and yellowish-gray color, most of them opaque yellowish in the centre. In the patient, a boy aged five years (No. 615, 1894), the spleen and kidneys were found similarly sprinkled with miliary nodules. Other conditions found were an older cheesy tuberculosis of the peribronchial and mes- enteric lymphatic glands, cheesy lobular pneumonia, tu- berculous pleurisy, and sero-fibrinous pericarditis. The exacerbation of the tuberculous process was observed in connection with whooping-cough. 56

Explanation of Plate 25. Diseases of the Lung Caused by Inhaled Dust. (Pneumonoconiosis.) Fig. a.—Red Iron Lung, Siderosis.—The lung tissue is deficient in air, of a very firm, board-like consistence, and of a reddish-brown color. Through the transparent pleura and in the parenchyma we see irregular, pale gray, fibrous condensed portions which are almost free from pigment. The lung was derived from a working- woman who for several years was employed in a Nurem- berg factory in coloring blotting-paper by dry-rubbing it with colcothar (ferric oxide). (The specimen was pre- sented to the Pathological Institute at Munich by Dr. Merkel, of Nuremberg.) Fig. b.—Coal-Miner’s Lung, Anthracosis.—A portion of a lung which is colored throughout pretty uniformly a slaty black. On the pleural side and on the cut sur- face we observe the interlobular connective tissue to be somewhat lighter colored, a slaty gray. The pulmonary parenchyma is condensed. The specimen was derived from a coal-miner who had died in his fiftieth year of a compound fracture of the thigh and had worked in a mine for about thirty-five years. Fig. c.—Stone Lung, Chalicosis.—The surface of the lung is of a steel-blue color, with distinct spots, and im- parts to the hand almost the feel of a grater. Beneath the pleura and in the parenchyma are numerous scat- tered firm nodules, ranging in size from a pin’s head to a hempseed, many of which have a faint slaty gray areola. Associated with the multiple nodules is a cer- tain degree of anthracosis (chalicosis anthracotica). The pale color of the tissue, which is particularly marked on the cut surface, has been artificially produced by preser- vation of the specimen in alcohol. The patient was a stone-cutter. 25

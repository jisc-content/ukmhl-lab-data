72 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Land with the retrocession of this process and the healing of the affection of the heart muscle; or else higher degrees of fatty degeneration occur, which greatly impair the function of the heart and may end fatally (fatty heart, fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). Interstitial myocarditis is met with as an acute in- fectious and purulent inflammation, either by exten- sion of infectious mycotic processes from the valves (endo-myocarditis) or by metastasis and embolism in septico-pysemia. Chronic interstitial or indurated myocarditis (Fig. 2) is mostly localized, though sometimes it is spread over large portions of the heart; when asssociated with or following destruction and disintegration it causes atrophy of the muscular elements of the wall and the formation of fibrous tissueâ€”callous indura- tions. It often results from circumscribed disturb- ances of circulation, in connection with sclerosis and contraction of the coronary arteries, and with embo- lism and thrombosis of these vessels associated with anaemic necrosis and hemorrhages. In place of the muscular bundles which have been deprived of nutri- tion or insufficiently supplied with blood a callous connective tissue develops by way of regeneration. Particularly at the tip of the left ventricle we find, as the terminal condition of such local circulatory dis- turbance and of the necrotic malacia caused thereby, extensive indurated masses with partial bulging of the lumen of the ventricle (chronic partial aneurism of the heart), whose interior is frequently covered with older, laminated thrombi situated at the wall. Stenosis and occlusion of the coronary arteries, by

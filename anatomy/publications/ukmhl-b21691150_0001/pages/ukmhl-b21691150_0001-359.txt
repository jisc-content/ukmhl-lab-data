In men it is remarkably more frequent than in women (4:1); this predisposition in men probably depends upon the corresponding fre- quency of hepatic diseases and alcoholism. Sponta- neous recovery from peritoneal tuberculosis is quite rare; in recent years arrest of the disease and even recover}- have been reported after simple laparotomy with removal of the liquid and coagulated masses of exudate. Neoplasms of the peritoneum are usually secondary; most frequently we observe secondary carcinosis in the form of multiple nodules and tubercles (Plate 51) or diffuse infiltrations of the omentum and mesentery with primary cancer of the stomach, intestine, liver, or pancreas. Ascites or states of inflammatory irri- tation are often associated with it. Among primary neoplasms of the peritoneum and its subserosa may be enumerated sarcoma, endothe- lioma, rarely fibroma and lipoma, also myoma which may spring from neighboring organs containing mus- cular tissue (subserous myoma of the uterus and its appendages). Of animal parasites echinococcus cysts and rarely cysticercus cellulose are found. Enteroptosis (Glenardâ€™s disease) is the term applied to anomalous position of the abdominal viscera char- acterized chiefly by elongation and stretching of the suspensory ligaments of the stomach and colon. As a result of this condition we find these organs abnor- mally movable and in faulty positions, e.g., the trans- verse colon, especiall}' its right flexure, is situated at the level of the umbilicus or lower, midway between symphysis and umbilicus; the stomach (gastrop- 15

71 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. Aside from tlie diffuse hypertrophy which affects all the parts of the heart uniformly, the right or left half of the heart is frequently found alone involved. Dilatation and hypertrophy of the right ventricle and auricle are often met with in restriction of the pulmonary circulation, in emphysema of the lungs, in diminution and shortening of the thoracic space by scoliosis and kyphosis, and in stenosis and insuffi- ciency of the mitral valve; while hypertrophy and dilatation of the left ventricle occur especially in chronic nephritis (renal hypertrophy of the heart), and in sclerosis of the arteries (vascular hypertrophy of the heart). The fatal issue in the various forms of cardiac hypertrophy, particularly also in the idiopathic vari- ety combined with dilatation, after a progressive ex- istence extending over years, is due in the majority of cases to weakness and exhaustion of the over- worked muscle, which need not show any terminal degeneration under the microscope. Myocarditis. Acute parenchymatous myocarditis occurs particu- larly with acute intoxications and acute infectious diseases having a marked febrile character. The muscle in such conditions appears relaxed, discolored to a grayish-red, and its consistence is diminished. Under the microscope we find in place of the normal transverse and longitudinal striation a finely granular opacity, which at many points merges into the first stages of fatty degeneration. The recovery from the causal disease goes hand-in-

Lobar croupous inflammation of the right superior lobe and of the adjoining portions of the median and in- ferior lobes, in the stage of gray hepatization. Death on the seventh day after the occurrence of the initial rigor. The infiltrated portions of the lung are of a firm, liver-like consistence, completely devoid of air, weight 1,070 gm. = 3f lb.; the cut surface is of a dull red- dish-gray color, finely granulated, with embedded slaty blackish oblong spots (anthracosis of moderate degree).

The pleural sac contains ^ litre pint) of a sero-puru- lent exudate. At the root of the lung several blackish peribronchial lymph glands are embedded. Aside from the fatal pneumonia and pyofibrinous pleurisy there were found incipient pericarditis (reddening and velvety opacity of the epicardium over the auricles), together with verrucose chronic endocarditis of the mitral and aortic valves.

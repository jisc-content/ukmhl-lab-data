DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 127 Erosion and necrosis of the trachea are now and then caused by an aneurism of the thoracic aorta, also by cancer of the oesophagus; in the former case the result is a sudden hemorrhage from the point of rup- ture of the aneurism; in the latter case, fetid bronchi- tis and inhalation pneumonia. Injuries of the trachea are usually caused by opera- tion (tracheotomy) or are of accidental origin, e.g., in attempted suicide when incised wounds open the trachea. When large vessels are injured at the same time, large masses of blood enter the trachea and may cause asphyxia, and when the oesophagus is also wounded food particles may pass into it. Under normal conditions the smaller tracheal wounds heal by the formation of a linear connective-tissue cica- trix ; sometimes a fistula remains behind. Stenoses and deformities of the trachea result most frequently by compression from without, e.g., by the formation of abscesses in the neighborhood, by aneu- risms, and in the majority of cases by enlargement of the thyroid gland, which causes the sword-slieath form of stenosis of the trachea (Figs. 5-15); also atrophy of the cartilaginous rings, or their connective-tissue metamorphosis. Besides, the lumen of the trachea is occasionally diminished and occluded by inhaled foreign bodies, more rarely by syphilitic cicatrices and infiltrations which cause strictures situated at times above the bifurcation. Tuberculous ulcers in the trachea are of compara- tively rare occurrence; sometimes they are extensions from the mucosa of the larynx. They correspond in the main with the alterations in the larynx or form multiple, closely crowded, lenticular defects in the

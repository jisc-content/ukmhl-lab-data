Explanation of Plate 43. Toxic Enteritis (Mercurial Dysentery). The mucous membrane in the upper portions of the rectum is deep red and covered at the top of the folds with discolored membranous masses. ~ The patient, aged twenty-five years, had died six days after delivery of puerperal sepsis and purulent phleg- mons of the pelvic connective tissue. During attempts at forceps extraction outside of the clinic a perforating- laceration of the left vaginal wall, 6 cm. = 2| in. long, had occurred. At the clinic the child was delivered with forceps and the laceration was sutured. Before the application of the forceps the vagina was irrigated with 0.1-per-cent sublimate solution, when the fluid evidently passed through the laceration into the pelvic cellular tissue. (For the illustration and notes of the case the author is indebted to Prof. v. Hofmann, of Vienna.) 43

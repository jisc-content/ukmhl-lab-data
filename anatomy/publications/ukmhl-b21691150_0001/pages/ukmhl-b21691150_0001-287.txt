DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN'S. 153 Desquamative Pneumonia. This form is characterized by the fact that the exu- date consists exclusively of proliferated and desqua- mated alveolar epithelia, and is largely classed with catarrhal pneumonia. The affected portions, usually the whole of the lungs or at least entire lobes, are en- larged, increased in weight, spleen-like in consist- ence, and rather grayish-red in color. The exudate escaping from the cut surface is tenacious, gelatinous, sometimes resembling frogsâ€™ spawn; the contained blood is usually moderate or small in amount; the pleura is not implicated. The disease rarely occurs primarily, more often secondarily, especially in con- nection with chronic oedema, with congestive con- ditions (desquamative congestive pneumonia), with acute miliar}- tuberculosis, with tuberculous chronic inflammation of the lung, now and then with infec- tious diseases (typhoid fever, pyaemia). This little- known type of pulmonary inflammation occurs in an absolutely pure form in verminous pneumonia of the domestic animals, when the pulmonary parenchyma is invaded by large numbers of the embryos of the strongvli, whose appearance resembles that of the trichinae. Chronic Interstitial Pneumonia. Pulmonary Cirrhosis. This is a chronic productive inflammation, usually observed as the termination of various inflammatory processes. It largely constitutes a kind of incom- plete recovery, since there is developed from the stroma of inflamed portions of lung a fibrous pro-

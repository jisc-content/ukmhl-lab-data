DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 197 gastro-colonic fistula is uncommon, and still rarer is adhesion to the anterior abdominal wall and perfo- ration outward, i.e., an external gastro-abdominal fistula. The fatal issue is usually due to general exhaustion and inanition. Numerous etiological factors have been cited as favoring the development of gastric cancer: preceding ulcers and cicatrices; thermic, chemical, and mechan- ical, oft-recurring lesions of the mucosa. As upon other mucous membranes (oral cavity, colon, female genitals) gastric cancer develops by preference at points where chronic inflammatory processes and ulcerations are most frequent, i.e., at the pylorus and in its neighborhood and at the lesser curvature, so that some connection between such irritative condi- tions and the development of carcinoma is not to be denied. Other neoplasms (sarcoma, myoma, lipoma) are extremely rare in the stomach. Foreign Bodies.â€”Bones, needles, and coins, which sometimes reach the digestive canal by accident or design, often pass safely through the pylorus and the intestine, or they may remain a long time in the stomach, or they may pierce the wall, causing fistulae and perforation toward the surface. Dilatation of the Stomach, Gastrectasia. This condition occurs as acute dilatation in conse- quence of overloading of the stomach or of serious dietetic errors (dilatatio ex ingestis), of excessive de- velopment of gas, and more rarely of affections of the muscular tunic (central paralysis?).

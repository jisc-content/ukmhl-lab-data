107 LYMPHATIC GLANDS. The lymphatic glands, similar to the spleen, react very promptly to infectious pathological processes and to such as are prone to metastasis from periph- eral organs, and are of the greatest importance to the physician in forming a diagnosis. Besides these fre- quent secondary and metastatic pathological proc- esses, there are also idiopathic primary infectious diseases of the lymphatic glands, especially those of a tuberculous nature, in which the germs pass through apparently normal organs or such as are prone to in- flammation (mucous membranes, pulmonary paren- chyma), reach the lymphatic glands, and multiply in them; thus we often observe, especially in children, primary cheesy tuberculosis of the glands of the neck or of the interior of the thorax. Particularly in the case of tuberculosis, but also in a number of benign inflammatory processes, we may note a characteristic difference in the predisposition with respect to age; while in children, especially the debilitated and poorly nourished, such diseases—both primary and second- ary—of the lymphatic glands are extremely frequent, persons of middle and advanced age are far less liable to them. The accumulation of foreign bodies in the form of particles of soot and carbon (anthracosis) is found almost regularly with advancing age in the peribron- chial glands at the root of the lung. At first we see the slaty-black pigment in the reticular lymph sinus, then in the cortical follicles, and finally scattered through the entire parenchyma; in men of middle and advanced age these glands in a condition of an- thracosis are usually quite black or slate-colored and harder than normal.

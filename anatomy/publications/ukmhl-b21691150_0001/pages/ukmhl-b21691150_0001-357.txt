DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 223 Etiologically it may be noted that in intestinal per- foration peritonitis sometimes minute quantities of the contents of the bowel entering the peritoneal cav- ity may suffice to set up a fatal peritonitis; of course such small amounts may also be absorbed or encap- sulated. As a rule in perforation peritonitis there is a multiple or mixed infection (in which the bacterium coli in its numerous varieties usually takes part), while the hematogenous and metastatic forms of peritonitis generally represent mono-infections (with streptococci or staphylococci). The cohtents of the colon are more dangerous than those of the small in- testine. A peritonitis of aseptic origin caused by chemical irritants (e.g., bile, or a filtration of feces free from bacteria) furnishes no purulent but a sero- fibrinous and hemorrhagic exudate. In perforation peritonitis the peritoneal cavity is invaded not only by pathogenic bacteria but also by chemical products (toxins, proteins, intestinal ferments, and products of fermentation) which are apt to influence the sec- ondary peritonitis. It is not yet positively deter- mined whether death in infectious peritonitis is due to intoxication or to nervous influences (continual nerve irritation, i.e., slowly acting shock). Tuberculosis of the Peritoneum. (Plates 48, 49, and 50.) Tuberculosis of the peritoneum occurs in several forms: 1. As acute miliary tuberculosis, either of hteina- togenous origin and a local phenomenon of acute general miliary tuberculosis, or by continuity from

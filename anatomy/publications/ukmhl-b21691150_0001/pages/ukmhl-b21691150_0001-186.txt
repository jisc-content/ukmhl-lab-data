Explanation of Plate 58. Syphilis op the Liver. Multiple Gummata. The liver is somewhat reduced in size, full of blood, and the acinous markings are obliterated. In the paren- chyma, partly situated subperitoneally, are three round- ish, yellowish-white foci of firm consistence, ranging in size from a cherry to a hazelnut, i.e., syphilomata. The milky opacity of the capsule over the lower portions of the liver corresponds to a shallow furrow caused by tight lacing. The greatly emaciated patient, a woman aged thirty- four years (No. 600, 1895), was syphilitic, having spe- cific ulcers upon the labia and in the vagina. Other con- ditions found were defect of the nasal bones (depressed nose), amyloid spleen, and progressive tuberculosis of both upper lobes. 58

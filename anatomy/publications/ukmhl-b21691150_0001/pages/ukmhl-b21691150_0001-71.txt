Explanation of Plate 19. Diphtheria and Croup of the Larynx and Trachea in a Child. The mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea is covered with a yellowish-gray pseudo-membrane; the latter appears somewhat folded and looks as if it could be easily detached.

The fatal issue was due to bilateral purulent broncho- pneumonia. 19

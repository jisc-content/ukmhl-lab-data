Explanation of Plate 3. 4 Brown Atrophy of the Heart. The volume and weight of the heart are reduced to about two-thirds to one-half of the normal; the cavities are narrowed (concentric atrophy) ; the coronary arteries run a markedly tortuous course. The muscle is of a dull brownish color (almost sepia brown) and of rather firm consistence. Owing to the general anaemia, the chambers of the heart appear narrowed; but, as the muscular wall surrounds a diminished cavity, the lessened bulk is to be determined not so much by the thickness of the muscle as by the decreased weight and volume of the entire heart. In defective development of the heart (hypoplasia), which is generally associated with hypo- plasia of the aorta, general anaemia, and stunted physical development, the brownish discoloration of the muscle and the characteristic tortuosity of the coronary arteries are lacking. The heart illustrated in the plate was derived from a woman, aged seventy-two years (No. 632, 1894), who was affected with diabetes and had died of carcinoma of the pancreas with metastases in the liver, the pleura, and the left kidney. Chylous and hemorrhagic ascites was found, together with pronounced general emaciation.

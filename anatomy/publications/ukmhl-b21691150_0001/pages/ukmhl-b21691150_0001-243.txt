109 LYMPHATIC GLANDS. lymplioid cellular elements. At last the gland con- sists of firm fibrous tissue, i.e., it is in a condition of chronic induration; this alteration takes place par- ticularly in the bronchial and mediastinal glands in consequence of anthracosis, chalicosis, and siderosis. Tuberculosis of the Lymphatic Glands. Tuberculosis is probably the most important and at the same time an extremely frequent disease of the -lymphatic glands. Tuberculous lymphadenitis occurs as a primary affection—especially in children and young people— or secondarily with primary tuberculosis of the lungs, intestines, bones, and joints. The glands are en- larged; on the cut surface we see comparatively sel- dom true tubercles scattered over it; more often the gland seems to contain irregular cheesy foci, recog- nizable by their yellowish-white color and their dry and brittle consistence; sometimes partial purulent disintegration is likewise present. In a more ad- vanced stage the enlarged glands are cheesy through- out, yellowish in color, and the lustreless cut surface resembles that of a raw potato. In the form of a primary tuberculosis this glandular affection occurs with special frequency in the cervical glands and in those at the root of the lung, more rarely in the ab- dominal glands; it constitutes the anatomical substra- tum of latent glandular tuberculosis, which clinically is largely comprised under the collective term “ scrofu- losis.” Tuberculosis of the cervical lymphatic glands of children and youths develops with or without pre- ceding primary affection of the peripheral organs;

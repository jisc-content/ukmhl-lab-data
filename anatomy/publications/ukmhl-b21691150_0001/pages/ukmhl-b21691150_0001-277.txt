DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN'S. 143 effused into the pleural cavity, the lung, retracted toward the root, changes to a flat cake-like mass, barely the size of a hand, which is devoid of blood and air, tough like leather, of a lead gray or slate color. The more recent the atelectasis and the shorter its duration, the more easil3r air again enters and restitutio ad integrum follows; the longer the ate- lectasis has existed the more difficult becomes restora- tion to health, hence the early operative removal of the pleural exudate is urgently indicated. Pressure from without is also the cause of that form of atelec- tasis which occasionally develops about the anterior sharp margins of the lower lobes in abnormal and prolonged elevation of the diaphragm consecutive to excessive distention of the abdomen (tympanites, peritonitis). Obstructive atelectasis results from occlusion of the bronchi in consequence of swelling of the mucosa and the accumulation of secretion. Corresponding to the arborization of the occluded peripheral bronchi we observe most frequently at the sharp margins of the lobes depressed lobular, bluish-red, and airless patches which may coalesce and gradually occupy the greater portion of a lobe. This form is most common in infantile bronchitis. Symmetrical atelectases are occasionally found in the posterior and inferior lobes of children dead of pharyngeal diphtheria or whooping-cough. In these cases, besides the occlusion of the bronchi the changed respiratory mechanism may be at fault, since it leads to excessive expansion of the upper and compression of the lower segments of the lung.

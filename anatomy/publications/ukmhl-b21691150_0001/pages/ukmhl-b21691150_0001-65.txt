Explanation of Plate 17. Cheesy Tuberculosis of the Cervical and Intra- Thoracic Lymphatic Glands. (Tuberculous Scrofulosis of the Lymphatic Glands.) The submaxillary and cervical lymphatic glands as well as those of the mediastinum and the root of the lung are enlarged throughout, usually from the size of a pea to that of a cherry, and united into bunches. The swollen glands are firm to the touch, the tissue of many gleaming yellowish through the tense capsule. On the cut surface the gland tissue appears changed into a friable, crumbly, cheesy mass of a light yellowish and whitish color; here and there the cut surface resembles a raw potato. The mesenteric glands have undergone a similar change. The specimen was obtained from a child, aged four months (No. 379, 1895), whose mother had succumbed to a pulmonary tuberculosis of extremely rapid course (“hasty consumption’5). Aside from the glandular tuberculosis the cause of death and chief morbid changes found were acute general miliary tuberculosis of the lungs, liver, and spleen, which had obviously resulted from the primary cheesy tuberculosis of the lymph glands by way of haematogenous auto-infection. Among the incidental conditions found in the child, which was extremely emaciated and very poorly de- veloped (body weight barely 2.25 kgm. = 4|- lb.), were caries of the right petrous bone, general furunculosis, and catarrhal enteritis. This was a characteristic case of primary glandular tuberculosis (tuberculous scrofulosis), in which the poison had penetrated with the air or with the food or with both from the mucous membranes (of the head, the neck, and the lungs) into the lymph channels and lymph glands. An intra-uterine, hereditary infection is pos- sible but not probable, since the entire morbid picture may be ascribed without difficulty and more simply to infection after birth. 17

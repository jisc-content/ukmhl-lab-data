The transverse and longitudinal striation is but faintly indicated; the several droplets of fat are larger and separated from each other. This variety can be demonstrated in grave acute infectious diseases. (3) Extreme fatty degeneration (Plate 2 a). The transverse and longitudinal striation has disappeared; the muscular bundles appear like tubes filled with fat; the drops of fat are very numerous and large, reaching the size of a red or white blood corpuscle. In the latter case the internal surface of the chambers of the heart appears spotted like a tiger skin. This variety occurs especially in chronic diseases of the heart and in tuberculosis. The contained fat rises from about eight or ten per cent of the solid constit- uents to twenty-two to twenty-five per cent. The heart muscle is at the same time friable, some- times of the consistence of butter, colored dull gray and pale yellowish; the cavities are dilated and the wall is frequently correspondingly stretched and thinned. Cor Adiposum. Adipositas s. Obesitas Cordis (Plate 2 b). The true fatty heart is characterized by excessive development of the subepicardial adipose tissue, which in the higher grades envelops the muscular structure like a capsule, so that the red muscular wall is not at all visible externally. In stout, well-nourished persons there is present beneath the epicardium, especially at the base of the

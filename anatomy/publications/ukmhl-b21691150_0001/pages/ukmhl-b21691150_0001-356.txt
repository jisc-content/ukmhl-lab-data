The amount may be minimal and still cause death; in other cases we may find several quarts of an inflammatory exudate, especially in hemorrhagic and sero-fibrinous perito- nitis. In the neighborhood of the starting-point, for instance, in perforation peritonitis, the exudation is usually most abundant. The more recent the inflam- mation the more commonly are the organs simply adherent and easily liberated; when the process is of .long standing the adhesions are firm. Among the secondary alterations accompanying peritonitis the most important to be enumerated are inflammatory oedema of the intestinal wall, meteor- ism due to paralysis of the intestinal muscles, and elevation of the diaphragm; encapsulated purulent exudates may occasionally perforate into the intes- tine and recovery may thus be favored. When this occurs, the loss of substance at the point of perfora- tion is usually greater in the serosa and subserosa than on the mucous surface. In perforation peritonitis starting from the intesti- nal tract gases may escape into the peritoneal cavity and cause tympanites; in ichorous forms of perito- nitis resulting from the escape of intestinal contents the development of gas may also take place subse- quently from the exudate. Ichorous and sanio-purulent peritonitis arises par- ticularly after perforation and injuries of the intes- tine (vermiform appendix) and in incarcerated hernia. The foetid exudate which is mixed with fteces contains bacteria of decomposition.

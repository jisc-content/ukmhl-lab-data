DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. 189 Wounds of the stomach are caused by bullets or stabbing; owing to the escape of the gastric contents into the abdominal cavity a fatal perforation perito- nitis follows within a few days. Inflammation of the Stomach, Gastritis. Acute catarrhal gastritis is due to numerous toxic, mechanical, and thermic influences. The mucous membrane is greatly injected, swollen, more folded than normal, and covered with abundant, tenacious, glairy mucus. A special form is caused by toxic agents (phosphorus, arsenic), i.e., parenchymatous gastro-adenitis; the mucous membrane is not so red but of a turbid, somewhat yellowish appearance; the glandular epithelia are enlarged, with a granular opacity; in the course of a few days the cloudy swell- ing passes into a fatty degeneration of the glandular epithelia. Chronic gastric catarrh (chronic gastritis) causes changes with special x>reference in the region of the pylorus and x>resents various forms, namely: In simple chronic gastritis the mucous membrane is diffusely thickened, swollen, and corrugated, jiar- ticularly near the pylorus; the submucosa is similarly thickened and proliferated. Yery often we observe in connection with chronic diseases of the liver and heart (cirrhosis of the liver, valvular defects, fatty heart, and disease of the heart muscle) a chronic congestive catarrh of the stomach. The mucosa is swollen, dark brownish-red or cyanotic in color, full of blood, succulent, and covered with abundant masses of mucus. As a rule, the same con-

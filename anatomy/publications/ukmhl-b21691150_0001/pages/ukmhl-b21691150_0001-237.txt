103 SPLEEN. Chronic splenitis is also found in a specially char- acteristic type in leukaemia (splenic form), in which the organ may be enlarged to ten, fifteen, or more times the normal and attain the volume and consist- ence of the liver; the color is a more fleshy red, the consistence firm, the tissue bloodless (Plate 14). Numerous variations are presented by engorgement of the spleen, which is observed, especially in the sub- acute and chronic forms, in many circulatory disturb- ances (diseases of the heart, lungs, and liver). In the initial stage the spleen appears enlarged, particu- larly in thickness, is full, of blood, dark cyanotic in color, the framework is increased, and the consistence firm (cyanotic induration, Plate 15). When the ve- nous hypersemia has lasted a long time, sometimes for years, e.g., in cirrhosis of the liver or valvular disease of the heart, the consistence increases stead- ily, the blackish dark color becomes more intense, the capsule is frequently thickened, and finally atro- phy occurs, usually associated with shortening of the organ (atrophic engorgement of the spleen). Among the circulatory disturbances the sequelae of embolic occlusion of the arteries—embolic infarctions so called—occupy a prominent place by reason of their frequency. Similar to the kidney, the arterial system of the spleen is arranged on the type of terminal ar- teries ; hence in embolic occlusion of the branches of the splenic arteries there is no corresponding collat- eral circulation, but infarctions form which present different types. We distinguish anaemic infarctions, when by reason of the local ischaemia early coagula- tion necrosis and decoloration of the affected segment develop; these infarctions are of a pale yellowish

Explanation of Plate 2a. 2 Fatty Degeneration of the Heart Muscle. (Degenerative Fatty Heart.) The subendocardial layers of the muscle are seen to be diffusely discolored, the tint being pale yellow and like a tiger skin. At the same time the muscle is very friable, of an almost buttery consistence, easily disin- tegrated with the finger. As a rule, the inner layers of the ventricular wall and the papillary muscles of the auriculo-ventricular valves are more markedly affected. Under the microscope the discolored portions show that the primitive muscular bundles are almost filled with fat droplets and granules, while the transverse and longitudinal striation has become nearly invisible.

Explanation of Plate 53. Chronic Jaundice (Icterus Viridis) with Adeno- carcinoma of the Liver. The liver is enlarged, the surface somewhat uneven, and of a dark yellowish-brown color. Hardly any blood escapes from the cut surface, but a profuse quantity of bile instead. The larger bile ducts are considerably di- lated and filled with bile. The parenchyma of the liver is of a dark olive-green color (icterus viridis). The cause of the mechanical icterus was found at the porta of the liver, in the shape of a carcinoma which had proliferated chiefly into the hepatic duct and thus had made the escape of the bile impossible. Duration of the icterus in the patient, aged sixty-five years (No. 57, 1895), about three and a half months. 53

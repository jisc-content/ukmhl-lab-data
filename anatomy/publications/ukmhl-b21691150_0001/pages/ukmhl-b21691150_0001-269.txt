DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGAN'S. 135 served. This li3rpostatic liypercemia occasionally re- sults in pneumonia (hypostatic pneumonia), when the tissue exhibits a spleen-like consistence. Post-mor- tem hypostasis, a cadaveric phenomenon, shows the above-described changes in a minor degree; this form is found in a most characteristic type in subjects whose death was sudden and when a prolonged period of time intervened between the death and the post- mortem examination. Pulmonary Hemorrhage. Hemorrhages into the pulmonary tissue may be of traumatic origin, such as stab and gunshot wounds or extraneous blunt force acting upon the thorax; when the pulmonary pleura is injured at the same time the blood is effused into the pleural sac (hsemo- thorax), and may also enter the bronchi, where it is mixed with air, becoming frothy and bright red. Effusions of blood into the lung occur also from the erosion of larger vessels in ulcerative and necrosing inflammations of the organ, e.g., pulmonary tubercu- losis and gangrenous processes. Blood which reaches the smaller bronchioles and pulmonary alveoli by way of aspiration from the upper air passages or from a cavity usually causes multiple dark brownish-red foci which are not sharply demarcated from the surround- ing tissue. Non-infectious pure blood penetrating into healthy lung in the above-described manner causes desquamation of the alveolar epithelium, of the epithelium of the finest bronchioles, also an im- migration of leucocytes, sometimes secondary peri- bronchitis, a proliferation of the interstitial connec- tive tissue, and a kind of desquamative pneumonia.

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 154 liferation, a callous and cicatricial metamorphosis. The affected parts appear more or less shrunken, of a firm consistence, they creak under the knife, are airless, anaemic, and discolored to a gray or slaty black tint (slaty cirrhosis) according to the quantity of the deposited pigment (soot). In rare cases, es- pecially when the process has developed from croup- ous pneumonia, the color of the firm, connective-tissue products is rather whitish, reddish-white, or almost fleshy (induration, carnification); the newly formed connective tissue is then iutra-alveolar, starting from the framework of the alveolar wall. Associated proc- esses frequently found are bronchitis in all grada- tions, bronchiectases, and membranous pleurisy. In some cases we can recognize even with the naked eye that the connective-tissue deposits spring chiefly from the interlobular connective tissue, from the connective- tissue sheaths of the vessels and bronchi (fibrous peri- vasculitis and peribronchitis). In chronic inhalation of dust (chalicosis and siderosis) extensive cirrhotic processes also develop often in the lungs. When cavities are associated with the usual slatjr cirrhosis the process is as a rule of tuberculous origin. Tuberculosis of the Lungs. (Plate 28, Figs, a and b; Plates 29 and 30.) Pulmonary tuberculosis occurs in three main forms: 1. As acute or subacute disseminated miliary tubercu- losis. 2. As tuberculous, usually recurrent fibrous or cheesy inflammation of months’ or years’ duration. 3. As a mixed form, a miliary eruption of tubercles being superadded to the tuberculous inflammation.

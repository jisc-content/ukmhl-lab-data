Explanation of Plate 38. Tuberculous Ulcers of the Stomach. At the fundus of the stomach, in the slightly reddened mucous membrane, are several roundish and oval, evi- dently rather recent ulcers with deep red areolae; the bottom of the ulcers is of a dull yellowish-white color. The cause of death of the patient (a boy aged four years, No. 274, 1895) was a chronic tuberculous peri- tonitis, with cheesy tuberculosis of the retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph glands, and confluent lobular pneumonia of the left side; there was also pronounced general emaciation. (The case is described at length in the dissertation by Kanzow: “ Ein Beitrag zur Casuistik der tuberkulosen Magengeschwure, ” Munich, 1895.) 38

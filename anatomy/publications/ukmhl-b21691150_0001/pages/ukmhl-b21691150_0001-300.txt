In the adult syphilitic processes in the lung are very rare; now and then we observe gummata, which may reach the size of a henâ€™s egg and have a tendency to necrosis, and the formation of cavities, especially in the middle and lower portions of the lung, some- times associated with circumscribed interstitial pneu- monia. In congenital syphilis of the new-born spe- cific processes are more frequent in the lung. First among these are gummata, which may soften and cause cavities resembling abscesses; next in order is white pneumonia, so called, in dead-born children or such as have lived but a short time after birth. In the latter the lung appears atelectatic or contains only traces of air, is of a whitish-gray or reddish- white color, with a histological structure resembling that of desquamative pneumonia. Finally, a syph- ilitic interstitial pneumonia occurs in children of feeble vitality; the lungs appear enlarged, of a gray- ish-red color, firm, with the contained air greatly diminished by reason of the smallness of the alveoli and of the cellular and connective-tissue thickening of the stroma. Neoplasms of the Lung. Primary new formations are very rare; now and then we observe primary carcinoma of the lung or bronchi, also enchondromata, multiple osteomata, and dermoid cysts. On the other hand the lung is

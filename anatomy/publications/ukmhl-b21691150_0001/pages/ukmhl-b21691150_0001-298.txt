164 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. treme frequency the apex is found changed into a cavity ranging in size from that of a hen’s egg to that of a fist, which is usually torn into by the force required to remove the organ. Aside from the large apical cavity the upper lobe often shows a larger number of irregular, older or more recent cavities; the cut surface then presents a sponge-like appearance with numerous perforations; the scanty remnants of the pulmonary tissue are more or less airless, partly showing a slaty discoloration and fibrous condensation, or they are sprinkled with recent and older cheesy foci. The middle portions of the lung contain besides patches of splenization with a gelatinous lustre and gray color (frog’s spawn- like infiltration, desquamative pneumonia), or lobu- lar cheesy friable foci, partly of a firm consistence, partly undergoing softening. The lower lobe usually contains acute and subacute sequelae, frequently in the form of tuberculous inhalation pneumonia as lob- ular cheesy infiltrations or peribronchitic patches arranged in groups (agglomerated tuberculosis), along with older slaty-gray foci of a firm consistence, surrounded by a circle of acute gray miliary tubercles. The tips of the lower lobes often contain small cavi- ties. In the intervening, still aerated tissue are iso- lated disseminated tubercles ranging in size from that of a millet seed to that of a pea, which are fre- quently visible through the pleura. Numerous transi- tional states between proliferative processes (miliary tubercles, infectious granulomata) and inflammatory conditions are found in many variations and com- binations. Very often there are developed in the formerly

181 DIGESTIVE APPARATUS. Diphtheroid Angina, Angina Necrotica. This occurs sometimes in very young and debili- tated children living under unfavorable hygienic con- ditions, and especially often in connection with scar- latina or measles, more rarely with typhoid fever, and can almost invariably be traced to streptococcus in- fection. The anatomical changes resemble those in true diphtheria. The process, as a rule, springs from the tonsils or from the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx; more rarely it spreads to the larynx and trachea. The diphtheroid crusts and membranes, which are usually thin, adhere firmly to the underlying tissue. Pharyngeal Diphtheriaâ€”Diphtheria Faucium. This is likewise a specific, necrosing, and exudative process, caused by the Klebs-Loefiler bacillus. To- gether with redness and swelling of the mucosa there appear gray and whitish spots, especially on the tonsils, soft j^alate, and uvula, which consist of a cellulo-fibrinous infiltration of the superficial layers of the mucous membrane. The fibrinous infiltration then extends into the deeper layers of the mucous membrane and undergoes hyaline degeneration as do the blood-vessels; hyaline plugs and masses are formed. Besides the escharotic spots, in place of the necrotic epithelium croupous membranes form, which tend to spread more superficially. After the eschars are cast off, shallow ulcers remain with eroded, some- times jagged margins and bottom.

Explanation of Plate 30. Subacute and Chrontc Tuberculosis of the Lung. Scattered in the reddish-colored, rather anaemic but aerated lung tissue we find a considerable number of mostly irregular, grayish-white foci, here and there sprinkled with slaty specks; these are of a friable cheesy consistence and sharply demarcated from the surrounding substance; the smallest of them, ranging in size from a pinâ€™s head to a hempseed, permit of the recognition in their centre of the lumen of a bronchiole (tuberculous peribronchitis and bronchopneumonia). The larger foci, many of them due to the confluence of smaller patches, exhibit, especially in the upper portions of the lung, occasional central disintegration, commenc- ing cavity formation; the smaller, irregular cavities, filled with cheesy pus and detritus, communicate at many points with the bronchia. At the root of the lung we observe slaty discolored, sooty peribronchial lymphatic glands in which may be recognized here and there beginning caseation. Other conditions found in the patient, aged twenty- seven years (No. 628, 1894), were tuberculous adhesive pleurisy, secondary ulcerative intestinal tuberculosis, and pronounced general emaciation. 30

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 204 of recto-vaginal fistuhe. Sucli ulcerative processes, wliicli may cause strictures of the rectum, are some- times due to syphilis, particularly in women, and are liable to be mistaken for cancer. Clysmatic ulcers of the rectum are of mechanical origin. Rectal fistulie are divided into: complete, when the fistulous passage connects the lumen of the rectum with the surface of the perianal integument; external incomplete (blind), when the fistulous passage does not open into the lumen of the bowel; internal in- complete, when fistula springs from the mucous membrane of the rectum and does not open externally (fistulous deep ulcer of the rectum). These fistuhe usually develop from small abscesses, more rarely, apparently, spontaneously; pretty often we find rectal fistuhe in pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis of the Intestine. (Plate 45.) A number of specific infectious processes is local- ized in the intestine; among these are typhoid fever (ileotyphus), cholera, dysentery, and tuberculosis. The latter is rarely primary, more often secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. While the former may be traced to alimentary infection (especially the in- gestion of raw milk from tuberculous cows), the lat- ter results from auto-infection, germ-laden sputa or their residues reaching the intestine with the food. In tuberculous children in whom cavities in the lungs are not frequent, ulcerative tuberculosis is much rarer (thirty to forty per cent) than in adults (sixty to

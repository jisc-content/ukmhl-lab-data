Explanation of Plate 55. Atrophic Cirrhosis of the Liver. Fig. a The liver is considerably reduced in size; the surface is coarsely granular, pale grayish-yellow in color. On section the creaking is distinctly heard; the parenchyma is almost bloodless, dry; the cut surface is likewise uneven and rough. Between the irregularly shrunken lobules the interacinous connective tissue is seen to be greatly though also irregularly developed. The patient, aged thirty-five years (No. TO, 1895), was affected with an angiofibroma of the sacral region; death by hemorrhage from the neoplasm. Echinococcus Cyst of the Liver (Parasite Dead). Fig. b.—A cyst nearly as large as a hen’s egg is pres- ent in the parenchyma of the liver. The fibrous capsule is thickened. Within is the collapsed, laminated cyst of chitin, partly detached from the wall, here and there still milky in color. Other conditions found in the patient, aged fifty-eight years (No. 278, 1894), were aortic sclerosis, secondary insufficiency of the aortic valves, granular atrophy of the kidneys, and a terminal purulent pleurisy over the right lower lobe. 55

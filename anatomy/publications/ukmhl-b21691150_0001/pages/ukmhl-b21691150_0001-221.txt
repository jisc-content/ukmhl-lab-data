87 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. In the aorta chronic endarteritis begins with the development in the intima of flat, garden-bed-like thickenings which differ from the surrounding parts by their more opaque and yellowish color. They consist of a gelatinous connective tissue, associated with which are accumulations of cells that exhibit a special tendency to fatty degeneration. In this way small shallow depressions are formed, which contain, when the process is farther advanced, minute gran- ides of fat, cholesterin crystals, and particles of lime. As such atheromatous foci gradually disintegrate the remaining layers of the intima, erosion, perforation toward the lumen of the vessel, and the formation of an atheromatous ulcer result. When this process oc- curs simultaneous^ at different points of the intima, the latter acquires a cribriform perforated appearance. At such ulcerating points small parietal thrombi form, which give rise to embolic occlusions. In older subjects, moreover, we often find a tendency to calci- fication of the hyperplastic portions, largely also a simple calcareous degeneration of parts of the wall which were previously normal. In that event we ob- serve embedded in the wall true calcareous plates which coalesce at many points; in place of the elastic and contractile vessel wall there is a rigid tube which creaks when divided with scissors. The chief char- acteristics of this grave process, therefore, are swell- ing, cellular and connective-tissue thickening having a marked degenerative tendency, in the shape of fatty metamoiq)hosis and calcification. All the stages of the process are as a rule found side by sideâ€”from the spotted yellowish opacity and garden-bed-like thickening to calcification and ulceration. The in-

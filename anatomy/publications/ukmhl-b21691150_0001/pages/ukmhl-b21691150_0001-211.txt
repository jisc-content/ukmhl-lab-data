77 CIRCULATORY APPARATUS. mal), tortuousness of the vessels passing under the epicardium, abnormal narrowness of the chambers (concentric atrophy). In the majority of cases, par- ticularly in men of middle and advanced age, the firm muscle is at the same time dull brownish discolored; this is due to the deposition of numerous golden yel- low masses of pigment in the region of the muscle nuclei (brown atrophy, Plate 3). In senile atrophy there is always some hyperplasia of the connective tissue, which is especially marked in the auricles (senile fibromatosis). In the atroph}^ observed in connection with fatty degeneration (fatty atrophy) the muscle is at the same time of a dull yellowish- gray color, often spotted like a tiger skin, usually with dilatation of the chambers (excentric atrophy). The atrophy of the heart muscle in adipositas cordis, in which connective tissue containing fat cells devel- ops between and in place of the atrophying muscular bundles, so that the muscle appears streaked with fat like bacon, has been discussed above. Mention might here be made of sclerosis of the coronary arteries occurring especially in men above forty-five years of age, either as a local phenomenon of general arterio-sclerosis or confined to the coro- nary arteries. These vessels feel like hard cords; when dissected out they appear as stiff, cpiill-like tubes with contracted lumen; their walls are usually irregularly thickened and contain deposits of lime. The heart muscle may present different conditions; now and then sclerosis of the coronary arteries seems to develop in a hypertrophied heart; more frequently we find secondary atrophic states of the ventricular walls, indurations, chronic aneurisms of the heart,

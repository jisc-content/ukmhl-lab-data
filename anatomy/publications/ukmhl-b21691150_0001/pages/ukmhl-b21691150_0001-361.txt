Diseases of the Liver. Injuries of the liver are met with as gunshot, in- cised, and stab wounds, and as subcutaneous rup- tures, the latter resulting especially from blunt force or a fall from a height; they end in death by fatal hemorrhage into the abdominal cavity or by second- ary infectious inflammation. The escape of bile into the abdomen causes sero-fibrinous peritonitis and sometimes terminates fatally. The capsule of the liver takes part in the diffuse inflammations of the peritoneum and in numerous, par- ticularly inflammatory processes of the liver; in this way, for instance, arises in hepatic cirrhosis a chronic adhesive and hyperplastic inflammation which very rarely may also be observed idiopathically with sec- ondary atrophy of the liver. Among the circulatory disturbances of the liver should be mentioned as a frequent form chronic con- gestive hyperaemia (Plate 52, Figs, a and b). This occurs regularly when the return of venous blood from the liver is retarded by valvular and muscular diseases of the heart. In the initial stages the liver is enlarged and of a dark cyanotic color; when of long standing there is capillary ectasia in the centre of the acini surrounding the central veins, with sec- ondar}' atrophy of the liver cells. The centres of acini in consequence present a dark brown to blackish- red color, while the marginal portions of the acini

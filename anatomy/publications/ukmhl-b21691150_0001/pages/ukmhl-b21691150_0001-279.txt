DISEASES OF THE RESRIRATORY ORGANS. 145 The more important forms of pneumonoconiosis distinguished are: 1. Anthracosis, soot or carbon lung (Plate 25, Pig. b), the most frequent form, is found in numerous gradations in the majority of persons. In the initial stages the lungs appear blackish discolored, partly in spots, partly in meshes; the particles of carbon are very small, roundish, and almost regular in the form caused by soot, while the particles of coal and char- coal are more irregular in shape, jagged, angular, pointed, and frequently of considerable size (carbon or miner’s lung). The initial stages and slighter grades are called anthracosis simplex, which is to be differentiated from the marked forms characterized by greater alterations in the pulmonary parenchyma, known as indurative anthracosis, the typical coal-miner’s lung, often combined with chalicosis (indurative anthraco- chalicosis). The accumulation of soot and carbon I>articles is usually greater under the pleura than in the parenchyma; the upper lobes are as a rule more markedly affected than the lower lobes, but the infil- tration of the apex is no greater than that of the re- mainder of the upper lobes. The portion of both lobes situated close to the spinal column behind the hilus is generally also greatly infiltrated. The ad- joining edges of the upper and lower lobes usually show an intensely black border; the surfaces that do not touch the costal pleura contain but little carbon in their subpleural portions. In the pulmonary par- enchyma the distribution is rather uniform; indu- rated condensed portions and those surrounding cavi- ties exhibit usually a more marked slaty discoloration. 10

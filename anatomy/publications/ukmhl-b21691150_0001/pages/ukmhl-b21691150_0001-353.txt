The invagination in- volves also the mesentery or the mesocolon; venous hyperaemia, stasis, hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic in- farction result; the invaginated portion forms a slightly curved, sausage-shaped, dark brownish-red mass. The intussusceptum consists of a descending inner cylinder and the ascending middle cylinder; the external (likewise descending) covering or sheath is formed by the inferior segment of intestine. In consequence of the occlusion the results are the same as in incarceration, i.e., dilatation of the superior portions of the bowel. The most frequent variety is the ileo-caecal, ileum and caecum being invaginated into the colon; more rarely we find invaginations of the ileum or colon. Agonal invaginations of the in- testine are frequent in infants; they are sometimes multiple, easily reduced, and free from every second- ary reaction. Volvulus is a torsion of the intestine either around its longitudinal axis, rarely observed in the caecum or colon, or the mesentery or mesocolon is twisted, the fixed point being at the origin of the mesentery; in- testinal occlusion occurs secondarily. There may also occur internal incarcerations with stenosis or occlusion of the intestine by pseudo-ligaments, sy- nechiae, especially between the great omentum and pelvic peritoneum, and by fissures in the omentum and mesentery. Prolapse is the protrusion of intestine through the anus, i.e., invagination of the bowel at its external opening. The surface of the prolapsed intestine con- sists of mucous membrane.

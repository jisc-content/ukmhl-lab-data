ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 138 ment it is usually increased, in forms of slow onset it is reduced and sometimes almost nil. In tire latter case, in oedema of slow development (chronic oedema), the fluid escaping from the cut surface very abun- dantly on slight pressure is not frothy but contains only sparse air bubbles. In the most pronounced cases observed in valvular disease of the left heart and after prolonged agony, in which states transi- tional to desquamative pneumonia develop by reason of excessive proliferation and shedding of the alveolar epithelium, the cedematous tissue is very pale, frail, brittle, in a condition of gelatinous softening (pneu- momalacia)—a state which sometimes merges into gangrene in consequence of the extreme disturbance of nutrition and the lodgement of germs of decomposi- tion. The bronchi and trachea contain in pulmonary oedema a frothy, sometimes sanguineous matter (hem- orrhagic oedema). . CEdema of the lung is due to vari- ous causes—in the form of collateral oedema it pro- gresses pari passu with collateral hypersemia; in the neighborhood of inflammatory infiltrations it belongs in part in the division of serous inflammations. In the form of cardiac or congestive oedema it develops in valvular defects and exhaustion of the left heart; in another group of cases the oedema, usually associ- ated with hydrothorax, is a local phenomenon of gen- eral dropsy (e.r/., in nephritis), or may be traceable to an alteration of the vessel walls. A decided influence of congestion and impaired circulation upon the de- velopment of oedema is shown most clearly by the frequent partial oedema in the posterior segments of the superior and inferior lobes following the horizon- tal position of the patient (hypostatic oedema).

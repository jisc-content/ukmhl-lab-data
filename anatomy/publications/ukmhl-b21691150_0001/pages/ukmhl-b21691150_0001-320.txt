186 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Other inflammations are uncommon; now and then a purulent inflammation of tlie submucosa may be due to the effect of foreign bodies. Ulcerations are also rare except perhaps in the lowest segments; in the cardiac portion peptic ulcer may result from the influence of the gastric juice. Ulceration may, how- ever, occur also in connection withâ€” Toxic oesophagitis, caused b}^ the ingestion of acids and alkalies, in all possible gradations from simple reddening to extensive eschar formation. After the moderate action of acids the mucous membrane is discolored gray or yellowish and wrinkled; after the action of the alkalies it is more brownish and soft; after intense corrosion the mucous membrane appears changed into a brown or black friable mass. Unless death ensues rapidly, the eschars are thrown off and are followed by ulceration, purulent inflammation, and the formation of cicatrices and stenoses. Necrosing and ulcerative oesophagitis may also be due to foreign bodies and to various local processes which implicate the wall from without, e.g., suppura- tion of mediastinal and peribronchial lymphatic glands, aneurisms of the aorta, prevertebral and re- tropharyngeal abscess in vertebral caries, etc. Diverticula of the oesophagus are sac-like, circum- scribed dilatations, two forms of which are distin- guished : (1) Pressure diverticula, usually situated in the upper part of the oesophagus where it merges into the lower pharynx. They result by pressure from within (during deglutition); owing to excessive stretching and partially diminished resistance of the muscular coat, the mucous membrane is forced through the

OF THE WOMB. 2^0 the lungs of breathing animals have conceived, that the liquor amnii is the fource of nourilbment, and that it is taken into the domach. I believe they have conceived fome analogy to exid betwixt the albumen of the egg and the liquor amnii, which in their minds has drengthened this opinion. But there is here no analogy ; we have feen, that the erubrio of oviparous animals being formed with the yolk in the egg-bed or ovarium, defcends info the uterus, and there receives the addition of the albumen or white. On the other hand, we find that the ovum of viviparous animals is formed in the ovarium ; and that the liquor amnii be- ing within the membranes of the ovum, mud be the production of the foetal fydem. Further, when the ovum has defcended into the womb, and grown to fome maturity, we fee that there is no connection by vedels betwixt the foetus and mother but through the placenta ; that the liquor amnii is within the in- volving membranes of the foetus, and that confe- quently it mud be thrown out by the vedels of the foetal fydem. Thus, to fuppofe the foetus to be fed by the liquor amnii, would be to fuppofe it to draw refources from its own fydem, and that the vedels poured out a fluid, which is afterwards to be taken into the flomach *. But without adducing arguments, it is fufikient to fay, that fcetufes have been brought forth, mondrous in their conformation, and without mouths yet well grown. ,* A greater abfurdity than that of which a foreign author is guilty cannot be imagined, becaafe the liquor amnii, or fome fluid, is found in the trachia, he fuppofes that the fcetus refpires, and receives oxigination from the liquor amnii.

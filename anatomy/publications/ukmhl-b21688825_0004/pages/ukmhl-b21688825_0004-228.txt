OP THE TESTES. I96 The convolute, and running together form the epididimis; from which the tube is continued under the name of the vas deferens. It pafles up the chord; enters by the ring into the abdomen; and then palling down into the pelvis, terminates in the veficulae feminales, in a manner prefently to be explained. It is not likely that the vis a tergo, the power of the arteries, pufhes the femen through all this length of tube, of which the epi- didimis itfelf is reckoned to befeveral feet in length, if the various convolutions were undone. Such an ac- tion on the tefticle as that of the dartos or cremafter mufcle, could give only a general ftimulus, but could not force on the femen in tubes which take fo a great a variety of directions. We are therefore left to the fup- pofition, that thefe tubes thenrfelves have a power of accelerating the fluids through them. Of the lymphatics of the teflicle w'e fhall afterwards treat; it is, however, neceflary here to remark, that Prochafka found in his injections a difficulty in making the mercury pafs the rete teftis into the teflicle. Ob- ferving at the fame time in his preparations, and in the drawings of all authors, an appearance of irregularities in this part like the valvular ftructure of lymphatics, he has been led to fuppofe that there is a provifion here for preventing the femen from being forced backward into the tefticle by the action of the cremafter mufcle; he conceives that when the cremafter mufcle draws up the tefticle to the groin, it may accelerate the femen in the epididimis, whilft this valvular ftruCture prevents the regurgitation upon the delicate veflels of the fubftance of the tefticle.

OF THE TEETH. 36 9 B b 3 feeding, with thofe of bone : in bone the pbofphate of lime is depofited on the membranes, or cartilage, but this hardening matter of bones is a fecretion from the veflels of the part, and is accumulated around the veflels themfelves: it is (till within the controul of their aftion, and-is fuffering the fucceflion of changes pecu- liar to a living part. But, in the enamel, the phofphate of lime has been depofited in union with a portion of animal gluten, and has no vafcularity, nor does it fuffer any change from the influence of the living fyflem. Although the hardening matter be principally phof- phate of lime, a fmall proportion of the carbonate of lime enters into the compofition both of bone and of enamel. Although we call the earthy depofit the hardening matter, yet it is the union of the glutinous matter which bellows the extreme hardnefs, for, when the tooth is as yet within the jaw, and in an early flage of its formation, the depofition is foft, and its furface rough; but, by a change in the furface, which throws out this fecretion, the firfl depofition is penetrated with gelatinous fecretion, which, either by this penetration (imply, or by cauling a new appofition of its parts, (itsflru&ure indeed looks like chryftallization,) bellows the denfity and extreme hardnefs on this crull. When an animal is fed with madder, the colouring matter coming, in the courfe of the circulation, in contaft with the earth of bone, is attrafled by it, and is de- polited upon it in a beautiful red colour. This colour- ing matter penetrates more than injection can be made to do in the dead body; and, as by this procefs of

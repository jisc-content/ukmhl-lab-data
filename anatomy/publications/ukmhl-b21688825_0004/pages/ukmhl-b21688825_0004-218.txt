OF THE TESTES. iSG communication betwixt the belly and vaginal cavity; it is obliterated and refolved into this cellular mem- brane. We fee then, that in this plan the teflicle and its coats, and the fpermatlc cord, are in their natural fituation, and that the herniary fac has defcended be- fore them. E, is the ring of the external oblique inufcle of the abdomen, through which not only the teflicle, with its coats and veffels, has defcended, but alfo the hernia: F, the herniary fac, which contains a portion of the gut; it is formed of the peritoneum, fallen down from the belly, but it is quite diflincl from the fac of the tunica vaginalis C. Whilfl this new procefs of the abdominal peritoneum has defcended, it has contra&ed adhehons, and cannot now be replaced. In thus explaining thefe important principles of ana- tomy, and which the anatomical fludent will find won- derfully to facilitate the more minute fhidy of furgical anatomy, it only remains to fnovv the nature of the hydrocele. The hvdrocele is a cclleclion of wTafer within the fac of the tunica vaginalis ; that is, betwixt the tunica va- ginalis and tunica albuginea. For, as we have feen, that the fame furface of the vaginal coat is contiguous to the furface of the teflicle (viz. the albuginea,) with that of the peritoneum, which is contiguous to the vifcera of the belly ; and as it has the fame exudation, fo it has the fame difeafe, viz. a colledlion of water, from the abforption being difpropor donate. to the exu- dation, When the tunica vaginalis is diftended with the water of a hydrocele, the teflicle is towards the back part ci: the loroturn; it can be felt there!; and - when

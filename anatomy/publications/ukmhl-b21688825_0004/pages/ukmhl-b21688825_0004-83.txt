OF THE STOMACH. 51 the upper to the lower orifice of the ftomach. Of this excitement and action we are not confcious; but when the action is difordered by an unufual excitement, the lower orifice is not unlocked, the adtion becomes vio- lent (the reverfe of what naturally takes place), and pain or uneafy feelings are produced. Upon this principle may be explained the naufea and vomiting which take place at certain times after eating, when balls or con- cretions are lodged in the ftomach. While the food lies in the greater extremity, or in the body of the fto- mach, and the ball or concretion with it, there is no great excitement; but when it has fuffered the necef- fary change, and is approaching to the pyloric orifice, this part, being as it were a guard upon the inteftines, is fuddenly excited, vomiting is produced, and the ball is thrown into its old place in the facculus or great end. This great fenfibility, producing effedls almofl like intelligence, is apparent in the more common diforders of the ftomach. We fhall find the meteorifmus ven- triculi (the great diftenfion of the ftomach by flatus) exifting for weeks, and yet the food pafling in regular courfe through its orifices. We fhall find very fre- quently food of difficult digeftion lying in the ftomach and oppreffing its fundtions for days, while food more recently received may have undergone the adlual changes, and have pafled through the pylorus into the duodenum. Owing to the fame flow and fucceffive adtion of the ftomach, it often happens that ulceration and fchir- rus pylorus, or other obftrudtion of the lower orifice of the ftomach, is attended with pain, naufea, and vo- Â£ 2 miting,

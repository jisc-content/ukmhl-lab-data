300 ORIGIN OF THE LYMPHATICS, pores or veffeis from which this fluid exudes are called exhalent; and their aftion is no doubt as completely fecretion as that which produces the fluids, which in pur wifdom we call more perfect fecretions. That the lymphatics take up the fluids thrown out in the cavities of the body, as the abdomen, thorax, pericardium, &c. there is what nearly amounts to an abfolute proof, in comparing the fluids of thofe cavities with that contained in the veffeis, for by the experi- ments of Hewfon it is found that if the fluid inoiftening the cavities be colle&ed, it will form a jelly when ex- pofed to the air, as the coagulable lymphatic does. Again, if a lymphatic veffel be tied up in a living animal, and then qpened fo as to allow the fluid to flow into a cup, it will alfo form a jelly like the coagu- lable lymph*. The fluid of cavities alters in animals difeafed; fometimes retaining its coagulability, and even acquiring ftronger powers ; fometimes lofing it al- together. But what is moll effential to our prefent purpofe, it has been obferved, that whatever change * But, by difeafe, the fluids in the cavities and cellular mem- brane is altered. In dropfy, for example, t,he fluid of the abdomen lofes the property of coagulating on mere expofure ; it comes to refemble more the ferum of the blood: this were fufficient proof that the colledion is not owing merely to the diminilhed abforption, but that there is a change of adion in the veffeis of the peritoneum, pleura, pericardium, &c. An inflam- matory adion of the veffeis will throw out a fluid more coagulable, and which, in a high degree of adion, will form a film of coagu- lable lymph or even pus on the furface. But in a ftate the reverfe of inflammation, fuch for example as the debility following inflammation, a ferous effufion will be poured out, having little tendency to coagulate. take3

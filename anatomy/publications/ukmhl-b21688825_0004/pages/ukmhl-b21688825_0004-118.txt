OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. 36 The natural divifion of this portion of the inteftine is into the coecum, colon, and redtum *. VALVULA COLI. The extremity of the inteftinum ileon enters as it were into the fide of the great inteftine at an angle f t And here there is a valvular apparatus formed by the inner membrane of the gut, which, more than any other circumftance, marks the diftindlion betwixt the fmall and great inteftines; for as the effedt of this valve is to prevent the regurgitation of the faeces into the fmall inteftines, it marks fufficiently the nature of the change produced on the injefta in their paflage through the fmall inteftine, and how unfit in their acrid and putre- fcent ftate they are to be longer allowed lodgment there. Upon opening the caput coli, or lower part of the colon, on the right fide, and examining the opening of the ileon into it, we fee a flit formed betwixt two foft tumid plicas of the inner membrane of the gut: the one of thefe is fuperior ; the other inferior. They are foft, and moveable, and feem fcarcely calculated for a valvular adtion. But there is little doubt that when the great gut is difterfded or in adtion, they are calculated to refill the retrograde paflage of the faeces * Some authors divide the great inteftine into fix parts, enu- merating the caecum; pars vermiformis ; the right; the left; and the tranfverfe colon ; and the laft part or reflum. f Of the entering of the fmall inteftine into the greater, fee Morgagni Adverfar. iii.

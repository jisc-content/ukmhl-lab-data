OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 337 liver, is by the broad ligament: thefe perforating the diaphragm join the trunk, which we have noticed under the (lernum, and in the anterior medeaftinum. It would appear, however, that thefe lymphatics of the broad or fufpenfory ligament, are by no means conftant and uniform in their courfe ; for fome times the run down towards the ladteal ligament, and perforate it there ; fome times they pafs down into the thoracic duÂ£t while dill in the belly. Other lymphatics of great fize, run off from the convex furface of the liver upon the lateral ligaments, and pierce the diaphragm. The lymphatics on the lower or concave furface of the liver are more irregular than thofe of the convex fide. They unite with the deep lymphatics coming out of the porta alongfl with the vena portae, enter into the glands, which are feated on the trunk of that veflel, and join the thoracic du<5t near the root of the fuperior mefenteric artery. The lymphatics of the lungs are nearly as nume- rous as thofe of the liver; but, indeed, in regard to this expreffion, it is more in relation to the facility of inje&ing and demonstrating the lymphatics, than to their comparative number. For example, if the lym- phatics of the other vifcera could be injected to as great minutenefs as thofe of the liver, we Should ceafe to con- fider that vifcus as more abundantly fupplied than other parts. The fuperficial lymphatics of the lungs form areolae, and cover the furface almod completely. They take a courfe to the root of the lungs, where they are joined by the deep feated veflels, and together pafs into the bronchial glands, and here the lymphatics of both fides freely communicate.

OF THE WOMB. 257 whether by this union of the fexes, there is an adtual addition to the ovum, or only an influence exerted on the parts already there, by the prefence of the male femen, it feems almod needlefs to hope for an abfo- lute decifion. The refemblance of the offspring to both parents, would influence us at once to conclude, that there mud be a union of the parts from both fexes. But when we confider how much the peculiarities of indi - vidual animals depend upon certain peculiarities of ac- tion ; how the conditutional predifpofitions mud de- pend on the fame peculiarities in the adtion of parts, fince the dodtrine of abforption teaches us, that of ac- tual fubdance nothing is permanent, but all fuffers an inceffant revolution and change, of which nothing can remain but certain peculiarities of adtion ; we may then come to allow, that the male femen merely in- fluences the date of the parts already formed, and does not bedow an actual fubdance. In the fpeculations on the fubjedt of generation, fadts and obfervations have been fo very rarely attended to, that thofe which have been offered feem to have had a preponderance much beyond their real value. Thus the microfcopica! demonffration of animalcule fwimming in the femen of the male, has given birth to an idea that they .were homunculi, which being in- troduced into the proper nidus of the female grew up to manâ€™s edate. Though, where all is conjecture, and, perhaps, as no better explanation is to be offered, it may feem improper fo diredtly to contradidt any theory, dill I mud fay, that this is, in my mind, the height of abfurdity.

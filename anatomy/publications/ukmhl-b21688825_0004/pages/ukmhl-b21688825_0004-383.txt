341 APPENDIX. Wronger than in the upper parts of the body, as they bear a higher column of blood. The veins are tranf- parent and the blood is feen through their coats. There can be properly diftinguilhed, only two coats in the veins : the outer coat, which is floculent and cellular without, to conneft with the furroundingparts, fmoother and more compact within, where it is united with the inner coat. In it are ramified the vafa vaforum ; and a fibrous ftrufture is to be obferved in fome of the larger and fuperficial trunks ; the ftriae or fibres run- ning longitudinally. The inner coat is firm and compact and intimately united to the other ; it is fmooth, flex- ible, and formed into valves in various parts. In all the larger veins, excepting thofe of the vif- cera of the abdomen, and thofe of the lungs and brain, there are valves : thefe valves confilt of the inner coat, forming folds like a femilunar curtain, hung acrofs the caliber of the vein ; but at the fame time attached fo obliquely to the fide of the vein, that they prefent a facculated membrane to receive the refluent blood. The loofe margin of the valve is fomewhat fironger than the other part, and betwixt the duplicature fome fplendid little filaments are fometimes obferved. Each valve confifts in general, of two femilunar membranes, the margins of which, falling together, prevent the blood from palling retrograde ; but they yield and col- lapfe to the fide of the vein by the current of blood flowing towards the heart. As the veins are provided with valves only where they are expofed to occafional preffure, and particularly to the compreffion of the muf- cles ; their chief ufe would feem to be, to prevent the retrograde movement of the blood, from the occafional compreffion

OF THE WOMB. 23I Ligaments of the uterus. To fupport the uterus from finking too deep into the pelvis, and to fteady it, and diredt it in its afcent during pregnancy, anatomifis have generally afligned as the ufe of the ligaments. But whatever good they may do in the latter operation, they are certainly unfit for the former. There are four ligaments of the uterus. The broad ligament of the uterus is formed of the peritoneum ; for this membrane palling down be- fore the rectum, and afcending again, and covering the neck, body, and fundus of the womb, defcends on the fore-part, fo as to reach the vagina before it rifes over the bladder. Thus it inverts the womb as it does the abdominal vifcera. This inverting of the womb with the peritoneum is indeed a provifion for its be- coming an abdominal vifcus, for in pregnancy it rifes out of the pelvis; and, being dirtended before the bowels, albumes in e^ery refpefl that relation to the pe- ritoneum which they have. As the- womb then is included betwixt the duplica- Cure of the peritoneum, it is this peritoneal coat, which being continued off laterally, forms the broad liga- ment of the womb. This duplicature of the perito- neum being a thin expanfion of it, has fometimes had the name of al^ vispertilionis : It is in truth like a myfentery to the womb and Falopean tubes, and ferves equally to fupport and convey the veffels to them. The womb and thertwo ligaments make a com- plete partition running acrofs the pelvis. From the fide of the uterus, a little below, and be- fore the going off of the Falopean tubes, the round ligaments arife. I confider thefe ropes as liga- ments.

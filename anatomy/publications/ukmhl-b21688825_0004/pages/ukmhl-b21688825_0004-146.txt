Experiments would even teach us, that the gall- bladder has not the fame irritability excitable by ftimuli applied to the coats, as the ftomach, inteftines, or bladder of urinS ; which is a proof that, like the iris, and many other parts of the body, its action is roufed more powerfully by the flimulus of fympathy and con- fent of remote parts, than by the detention of its coats ; whereas the inteftines and bladder have it in their conftitution to be excited to contraction by fimple diftention. From experiments it would appear, in confirmation of what is here alleged, that while the food is in the ftomach little bile is difcharged; but that it flows when the matter is palling the duodenum, fo that a great quantity is then formed in the gut. On the contrary, in a ftate of want and hunger, the gall- bladder is greatly diftended, and yet little bile flows from it; although it is not only more accumulated, but more acrid and bitter *. The gall-bladder is not deftitute, however, of irrita- bility and the power of contraction ; for if would appear from many cafes that, like the urinary bladder, it contracts upon concretions, and becomes thick in its coats.

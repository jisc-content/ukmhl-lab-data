/ 2go OF THE CAPILLARY VESSELS. literal, is not the general meaning of the term. By capillary veflels is rather underftood thofe branches in which the changes are wrought from the blood, and which are either fo minute as not to allow the pro- mifcuous flow of the blood, or poflefl'ed of fuch a degree of irritability and appetency, as only to allow certain parts of that fluid to be tranfmitted. It is proved that in the living body there is no ex- udation ; but no fooner is the animal dead, than the fluids exude from the veflels, the fecretions pafs through the coats of thofe receptacles which formerly contained them, and the whole parts partake of an univerfal colour. From this Ample faCt, we are led to think that a property exifts iii the living fibre, which by con- traction or fome other property repels the fluids. Admitting this, it is very natural to fuppofe that the fibres, and more particularly the veflels, have a difcri- minating property ; fo that the capillary texture of each organ poflefles fenfibility, which has its relations to the fluids palling through them, or to be fecreted from them. If we admit this, we may alfo forfee the explanation of the moll puzzling phenomenon of inflammation. Inflammation is the effeCt of excitement: there is increafed aCtion of the arteries; and by the operation of the fame caufe, there is a deftruCtion of the natural fenfibilities of the capillary veflels, fo that they no longer are poflefl'ed of their diflinguilhing fenfibility, and they admit the promifcuous paflage of the red blood: they become dilated by the aCtion of the arteries, and vifibly diflended with red blood. . The effedt is not merely the mechanical derangement of the particles

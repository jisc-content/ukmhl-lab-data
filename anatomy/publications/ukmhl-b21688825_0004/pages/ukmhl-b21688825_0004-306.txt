55 4 OP THE WOMB. as feen and defcribed by Dr. Hunter, and of their cor- rectnefs, my obfervations in difleftion leave no doubt in my mind. AA, The uterus in out-line; B, the amnion with the foetus ; C, the chorion. Now it is Â©bferved, upon a careful examination of an abortion of the early months, that befides the chorion and amnion, there is a fpongy membrane of two diftindt lamina which inverts the chorion. The outermoft of thefe is found to furround the whole ovum, even in- verting that part which has become the placenta by the accumulation of veflels. This outer membrane then may be reprefented by the line DD. It is repre- fented as adhering to the furface of the womb, as it murt do in fadl. We obferve again, that it is per- forated where the Falopean tube enters the womb, that at this part it is not formed; fo that, according to Dr. Hunter, and the preparations which I poflfefs, thefe tubes open into its infide. Upon diffecting up the outer lamina of the decidua, we find that where the placenta commences, it is re- fiedled over the furface of the ovum and the fhaggy chorion of the ovum, fo as to be reprefented by the letters EE. We fhall now underftand the diftindtion betwixt the Decidua Vera DD, and the Decidua Rejlexa EE. It would appear that this membrane is either com- pletely formed, or at leaft the fluid which is to form it, is throwm out previous to thedefeent of the ovum ; indeed, fo intimate is the fympathy betwixt the whole uterine fyftem, that this membrane is formed in thofe cafes where the ovum does not defeend, but conflitutes the extra uterine conception.

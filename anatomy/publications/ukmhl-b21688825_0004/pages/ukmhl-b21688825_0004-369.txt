OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 327 neck, to unite with the great trunk of the fyftem ; they have an equal opportunity of dropping their contents into the angle betwixt the right fubclavean and the jugular vein. Thefe veflels then uniting, form, a trunk which is little more than an inch, nay, fometimes not a quarter of an inch in length, but which has nearly as great a diameter as the proper trunk of the left fide. This vefiel lies upon the right fubclavean vein, and receives a very confiderable number of lymphatic vef- fels: not only does it receive the lymphatics, from the right fide of the head, thyroid gland, neck, &c. and the lymphatics of the arm ; but it receives alfo thofe from the right fide of the thorax and diaphragm, from the lungs of this fide, and from the parts fupplied by the mammary artery. Both in this and in the great trunk there are many valves. OF THE LACTEALS AND LYMPHATICS OF THE IN- TESTINAL CANAL. We have already remarked the great length of the inteftinal canal, the effect of the imperfect valvular ftru&ure, in extending the inner coat to a great length $ we have remarked alfo, that while every furface of the body fecretes, it is at the fame time an abforbing fur- face ; and finally, that while we chiefly contemplate the inteftinal canal, as imbibing and receiving the nourifhment, we muft not forget that it is alfoafecret- ing furface of the firft importance to the ceconomy. But at prefent we have merely to underftand that ftru&ure and organization, by which this canal abforbs tfle nutritious fluid the chyle from the food. In

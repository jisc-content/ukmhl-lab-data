OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 69 acrid flate of the food produces anxieties and increafed pain, inverted motion, vomiting, and even cholera*. We mull not forget, that the inverted adtion of the ftomach draws quickly after it the inverted motion of the duodenum. It may be of confequence to attend to this in the operation of an emetic, for the ftomach will fometimes appear to be difcharging foul and bili- ous matter which we naturally may fuppofe to have been lodged in it, but which has actually flowed from the duodenum, or has even come recently from the dudts in confequence of the operation of the vomitf. From a defect in the natural degree of the ftimula- ting power of the bile, it will accumulate in the duode- num, occafioning anxiety and lofs of appetite, and even congeftion of blood and a jaundiced {kin ; we may cer- tainly affirm that thefe at leaft are often connected. Such accumulation in the duodenum mad be attended with a languid action of the whole canal, and inactivity of the abdominal vifcera, becaufe the periftaltic motion is begun here in the natural adtion of the interlines; and if its peculiar famulus be deficient, fo muft that of the whole fyllem of the vifcera. Hence the neceffity of roufing and evacuating the whole canal. 1 may farther obferve, that it has been the opinion of the molt refpedtable old phyficians, thofe whofe * Indeed vomiting in confequence of concufiion and compref- fion upon the whole contents of the abdomen, and in a par- ticular manner on the liver, affords mod; powerful means of operating upon the infarction and remora of the blood in the hepatic fyftem. -j- See Sandifort, vol. iii. p. 288.

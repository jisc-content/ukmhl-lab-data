OF THE TE3TES* 102 gland '; the union of the vas deferens and dud of the veficulae is not attended with an enlargement of the dud ; on the contrary, as the dud pafles forward deep into the fubftance of the gland to arrive at the urethra, it becomes remarkably narrower until it opens in a very fmall orifice in the verumontanum* as we fee reprefented in the third plate. The dud (if we may fo call it>) of the veficulae pafles a full inch forward into the gland before it terminates in the urethra. Thefe veficulse have been in general fuppofed to be receptacles for the femen; but as this is an opinion depending on the connedion of thefe bags with the extremities of the vas deferens, and as comparative anatomy fhows many inftances of thefe veficulae being unconneded with the duds of the tefticle, there is much reafon to doubt whether they really are merely refervoirs. They have always appeared to me as ufeful in adding a fluid to the fecretion of the tefticle, which being poured together into the finus of the urethra, give a diftention, exciting and giving effed to the contradion of the ejaculator fe* minis : For uniefs there were a provifion of fluid fufiicient to diftend the finus of the urethrae, the femen could not be thrown out from the urethra. This fuppofuion is not oppofed by the fads ftated by Mr. blunter, that in many animals the veficulae and vafa deferentia open by diftind foramina into the urethra* becaufe in that cafe the fluids of thefe fecreting bags might be equally mingled with the femen in the finus of the urethra, although they do not flow from the fame tube.

OF THE WOMB. 238 SECTION IV. OF THE OVARIA. The ovaria, are two oval bodies, which are fuf- pended in the broad ligament behind, and a little be- low the Falopean tubes: while they have an oval figure, they are fomewhat flattened. By cutting out the ovaria, the animal lofes the power of conceiving, and defire is extinguilhed; they, therefore, beftow wlfat is effential to generation upon the part of the fe- male. In vague fpeculations on the fubjed of genera- tion, they were fuppofed to prepare a female femen! but more particular examination demonftrates, that they confift of veflicles, which are ova; but how far incomplete, or in what effential circumftance requiring the approach of the male, is not determined. When we hold the fedion of the ovarium betwixt the eye and the light, we fee a great many pellucid veflicles; and if we examine the ovariuih of an ani- mal killed in full health, and particularly in the fea- fon, we fhall obferve thefe ova to be in all varieties of flates of preparation for impregnation. Some fmall and pellucid, and yet only difcernable in the thick outer coat, by having a degree of greater tranfpa- rency ; others, which have taken a flight tinge of bloody colour from veffels ftriking into them ; and if the fedion be made after a minute injedion, the vefli- cles will be feen coloured in the proportion of their maturity $ fome without a fpeck of colour j others tinged;

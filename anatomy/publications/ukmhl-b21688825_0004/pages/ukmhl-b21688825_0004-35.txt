But more than this, there is a decompofi- tion of the folids of the body which are carried into the circulating fluids* and finally difmilfed from the fyftem. Laftly, we cannot but obferve, that even the powers of mufcular motion, nay, the powers of the mind and of the fenfes, are exhaufted by exercife, and renovated through the influence of the circulation. The conti- nued adion of a mufcle is followed by feeblenefs and the continued impreflion of the rays of light exhaufts the retina, fo that the objeft becomes firfl faint and then vanifhes. Since there is wafte of the folids and fluids* and exhauftion of the energies of the fyftem, fo alfo mull there be a fource of fupply, and means of renovating its adion. Accordingly animals have appetites requir- ing the fupply of food, and the call of hunger is controlled by the neceffities of their fyftem. When food is received into the firft paflfages, there is thrown out from the flomach a fluid which dilfolves it, changes its properties* and is itfelf eflentially altered. The work of aflimilation is thus begun. As this converted fluid takes its courfe through the inteftines, it is more and more changed j more aflimilated to the nature of the peculiar fluids of the animal; and having ftill ad- ditional fecretions united to it, particularly the bile, it is by thefe means feparated from the grofier parts of the aliment. This fluid, which is now called chyle, is abforbed by a particular and appropriate fyftem of veflfels, which, from their conveying this white and milky-like fluid, are called the ladeals.

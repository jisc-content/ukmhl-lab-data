109 OF THE LIVER. to the right and left fide of the liver. Thefe two divifions of the hepatic duct approaching each other, unite (C), while they are attached to the right branch of the vena ports;. Their union conftitutes the he- patic du£t, or dudtus choledochus. When the du£t of the liver has advanced a little Way from the tranfverfe fiflure, it is joined by the cVstic duct (B), or perhaps we Ihould rather fay, confider- ing the ufe of the cyftic du£t, that it is reflected from it at an acute angle to the right fide. The ductus cysticus is much fmaller than the hepatic du£t; and is fomewhat curved in the dire£tion towards its expan- fion into the gall-bladder ; for there it takes a very fudden turn downward, as is feen in the marginal plate. The hepatic du£t, after being joined by the cyftic du£t, continues its courfe under the name of du&us communis choledochus, or common du£t *. Now become fome- what larger, it takes its courfe under the head of the pancreas to the back part of the duodenum, about five inches from the pylorus. Before it enters the gut, or more generally while in- cluded in the coats, it is joined by the pancreatic du£t. Having pierced the mul'cular coat, it runs for fome time in the cellular coat, in the length of the gut, and then opens upon the eminence of a confiderable valvu- lar plica of the inner coat. This hole is regularly limited, and by no means equal to the diameter of the dud, either where it is Contained within the coats of the gut, or in its courfe * Du&us choledochus, hepatico cyfticus, (D,) from

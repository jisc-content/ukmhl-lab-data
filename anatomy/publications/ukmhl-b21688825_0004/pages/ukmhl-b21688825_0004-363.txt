OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 321 The deep-feated lymphatics of the arm accompany the arteries in the fame manner as the venae comites do ; in general two with each artery. They all termi- nate in the glands of the axilla, and can require no particular defcription. The lymphatics, from the mufcles and integuments on the back of the fhoulder, alfo turn round and enter into the glands of the axilla. The glands of the arm are fmall, and irregularly placed in the courfe of the humeral artery, from the condyle to the axilla. They are from three to fix in number. The glands of the axilla are large and nume- rous ; they receive the lymphatics from the arm, bread, and fhoulder * ; they lie in the deep cavity of the axilla, formed by the tendons of the pe&oralis major, and latiflimus dorfi mufcles. They are imbedded in a loofe cellular membrane, which, while it furrounds and fupports the vefiels of the axilla in the motions of the joint, gives them ftrength from its elafticity. Thefe glands do not all furround the axillary artery; but a lower duller is attached to the branches of the fub- fcapular artery, going forward on the fide of the chert, and to the thoracic arteries. Thefe it is which, indu- rating from cancer of the bread, require fo frequently to be extirpated. Thefe glands of the axilla greatly inlarging clofe upon the artery and plexus of nerves, fo as to preclude the poflibility of an operation j they comprefs the veins and benumb the arm by preflure upon the nerves. When they fuppurate, they caufe a * “ They even receive abforbcnts from the cavity of the cheft and 1 have known them fwell from pleurify, peripneumony, and pulmonary confumption.” Cruickfhanks.

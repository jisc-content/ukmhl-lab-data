250 OF THE WOMB. perhaps a.ftate merely capable of being excited Into life and motion, continues for the winter feafon, or for a longer period. The flower of plants folicits the fluids to the feed, as the influence of the leaf cherilhes the bud in the axilla. The pulp of the fruit is probably a provifion of the fame kind, or when it has fallen, to lay the foundation, by its decay, of a foil fuited to the tender plant. In the feed itfelf, we have much to admire. We find it incafed in a ftrong hulk, or fhell, which is in general provided with a porous part ready to imbibe the moifture of the ground. In the nut within the outer fhell, there is a foft fpongy fubftance, which, re- ceiving the moifture, fwells and burfts up the lhell, and relieves the feed. The kernel of the nut is then like a common feed, it has begun to vegetate, and thefe are the parts which form the fyftem of its ceco- nomy. The principal part of the feed confifts of al- buminous matter for the fupply of the nourilhment to the embryo plant, fo as to prolong its fhoots, and to fend down its roots into the earth. The little embryo plant lies complete in all its parts, betwixt the lobes of albuminous matter, in a ftate of torpor, or in which the operation of the living principle is fufpended. From the embryo plant there extends into the albumi- nous matter of the feed veflels, or tubes, inactive, but ready on the fupply of heat and moifture, to abforb the nutritious matter of the albumen, and minifter to the increafe of the embryo plant. Now the root of the little plant lprouts from the feed, and has a tendency to ftrike into the ground, and

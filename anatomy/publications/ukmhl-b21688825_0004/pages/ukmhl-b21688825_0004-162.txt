J.3Â° OF THE SPLEEN. The fpleen is of no regular figure. Where it hr contiguous to the diaphragm it is uniformly convex: towards the ftomach its furface, while it is hollowed out and concave, prefents two Tides, fo that we fay the whole mafs is fomewhat of a triangular form. The anterior edge of the fpleen is notched with deep fulci j behind and at the upper part the margin is large and round. The fubftance of the fpleen is the moft fpongy, ten- der, and foft of the abdominal vifcera; fo much fo that not only does the finger make an impreflion up- on its furface, but it a&ually diforders and tears its veflels. After a fuccefsful injedlion the whole feems made up of veflels ; and if any thing like acini or glo- bules are to be obferv'ed, the microfcope will fhow them to be accidentally produced by the fafciculi of veflels. It has a ftrict refemblance to the fubftance of the placenta. The fpleen is feldom fmaller than na- tural ; often greatly enlarged. I have feen it equal to the liver in fi-ze, and filling the whole left fide of the belly. It has been frequently found thus enlarged, without any peculiar fymptoms indicating fuch a dif- eafe during life. From its fbft texture and great vaf- cularity, like the liver, it has been found rent by blows and falls j and wounds here, as in the liver, by open- ing the large veflels are fuddenly fatal. Sometimes it is hard and fchirrous, and marbled in its colour. There is feldom fuppuration in it. The fpleen has been largement in afcites. From which circumftances it will not be wonderful if it is wounded in tapping for the afcites. See Monro on Dropfy. * , fuppofed

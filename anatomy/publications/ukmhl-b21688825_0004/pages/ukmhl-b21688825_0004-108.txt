Phyfiologifis have made a diftinCtion in the motion which they have obferved in the inteftines of living animals. The one they call the vermicular, and the other the periflaltic motion. Upon looking into the belly of a living animal, or of one newly killed, there may be obferved a motion among the inteftines, a drawing-in of one part and a diftention and elongation of another part of the convolution. This motion has fome refemblance to the creeping undulating motion of a reptile, and has got the name of vermicular mo- tion. On the other hand, the direCt contraction of the gut by the conftriCtion of the circular fibres is the periftaltic motion. We muft not however allow ourfelves, from the loofe expreftion of authors, to imagine, that thefe circular {freight fibres aCt feparate- ly: on the contrary, excited by the fame ftimulus, they have a fimultaneous motion to the effeCt of ac- complilhing the perfeCt contraction of the gut and motion of its contents *. While the ftimulus is natural, the contraction of the mufcular coat is in a regular feries from above down- ward, and, the lower part contracting before the upper is completely relaxed, the food muft be urged down, ward into the lower portion. I fhould even imagine that the lower portion is relaxed, from its more ufuat * Neither can I allow that the afting of the longitudinal fibres in one portion of an inteftine dilates that which, is below, other, ways than by the compre'Tion of food and flatus. degree

U 4 and OF THE CAPILLARY VESSELS. 2<)\ particles of the blood. The chemical changes which take place in the extreme veflels are disordered, and the blood depofits upon the -extreme branches of the nervous fyftem an unufual proportion of irritability ; fo that with the rednefs arifing from the circulation of red blood through the hitherto pellucid veflels, in parts not endowed with fenfibility, there is acquired an unufual fenfibility, and the power of tranfmitting the fenfation to the fenforium. Since we fee that in an inflammatory date the pellucid veins tranfmit red blood, and that this red blood mud be Supplied by the ferous arteries; then it is proved that anfwering to the pellucid arteries (in their natural date) there are pellucid veins. We (hould acquiefce therefore in the opinion that fup- pofes both the arteries and veins to have pellucid capil- lary branches anfwering to each other, collateral to the larger and more palpable anadomofis of their red extremities. Thefe anadomofing branches of the arteries and veins in which the red blood is feen to circulate, perpetuate the flow of the greater part of the blood back to the heart, while the Several Secretions are performed in the capillary veflels*; but there is no reafon to fuppofe that the fluids Sent from the arteries into thefe pellucid capillary veflels are all poured out in form of Secretions : part returns into the extremities of the circulating veins.' The fecreted fluids and Solids are either carried away by duels into their receptacles, or thrown out from the body : while thofe fluids which are exuded on the cellular membrane and cavities are re-abforbed by the fydem of abforbent lymphatics. We fay then that arteries terminate, fird, in red veins; which is proved by the microfcope, and by mercurial

OF THE STOMACH. 6t the furface of the ftomach. It is a fluid, then, upon which the chemift can operate with no hope of a fuc- cefsful or uniform refult. And indeed chemiftry feems no farther to aflift us in forming an accurate concep- tion of the changes induced upon the fluids in the ali- mentary canal, than that the more perfect, but ftill vefy deficient, experience of the modern chemift fuc- cefsfully combats the fpeculations of the chemifts of former ages. For example; it was formerly fuppofed that digeilion was a fermentation, and that this fermen- tation was communicated and propagated by the gaftric juice. It is now found that the gaftric juice has pro- perties the reverfe of this ; that it prevents the food from taking an acid or putrefactive fermentation; that it aCts by corroding and diffolving the bodies received into the ftomach; and that it is itfelf at the fame time converted into a new fluid, diftind in its properties *. It is almoft fuperfiuous to obferve, that the gaftric juice has no power of acting upon the coats of the ftomach during life ; whether this be owing to the pro- perty, in the living fibre, of refiftance to the aft ion of the fluid, or that there is a fecretion bedewing the fur- * The moll curious faÂ£t is that property of the coats of the ftomach, or of the fluids lodging in the coats of the ftomach, by which milk and the ferum of the blood are coagulated. It has been found that a piece of the ftomach will coagulate fix or feven thoufand times its own weight of milk. This aclion feems a neceflary preparation for digeftion, which {hews us that the molt perfeft and Amply nutritious fluid is yet improper, without undergoing a change, to be received into the fyftem of veflels. For example; milk and the white of eggs are firft coagulated, and then pafs through the procefs of digeftion. See J. Hunter, Animal (Economy, Obfervations on Digeftion. face,

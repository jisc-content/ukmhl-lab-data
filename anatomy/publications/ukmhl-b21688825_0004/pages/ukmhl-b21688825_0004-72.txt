With this intention, following the courfe of the food, and with a view alfo to con- ned the prefent fubjed with the lalt part of vol. iii. we treat firlt of the cefophagus. SECTION I.

Still continuing its courfe in the back part of the thorax, it perforates the dia- phragm, and expands into the upper orifice of the ftomach ; its ufe is to convey the food by deglutition into the ftomach. Although with many authors I call it a cylindrical tube, and it may take this form when diffeded from the body and inflated, yet during life it lies collapled with its inner membrane in clofe contad, and it tranf- mits the morfel only by the continued fucceflion of the contradion of its flelhy coat.

OF THE BLADDER OF URINE. 159 ftretched over the parts in the pelvis, in obftruding the progrefs of inflammation from the bottom of the pelvis towards the abdominal vifcera, we mult recoiled that there exifts fuch a fympathy betwixt the bladder, and the ftomach and bowels, that both after operation, and in confequence of obftrudion of urine, the patient will (ink, in confequence of abdominal inflammation, with- out the dired fpreading of the inflammatory adion.

They are fo ftrong as to have been clafled with the diftind mufcles, and the whole coat has been called detrusor urin,e. Towards the lower part of the bladder the fibres are particularly ftrong, and formed into fafciculi, and are like a net of mufcles in- clofing the bladder. Towards the neck of the bladder the circular fibres are ftrengthened; and embrace the beginning of the urethra; and form a fphinder, which, no doubt, is affifted in its operation by the levator ani mufcle, throwing its ftrong fibres around the neck of the blad- der. The mufcular coat of the bladder becomes greatly ftronger, where difficulties oppofe its difcharge; and when there is a fource of irritation, within the bladder, ading for any time, the whole coats become thickened, fometimes to the depth of half an inch or more ; in which cafe, as we have obferved, to take place in the ftomach, it is capable but of a very incon- fiderable change, either by detention or contradion; confequently the urine runs frequently by painful dif- charges.

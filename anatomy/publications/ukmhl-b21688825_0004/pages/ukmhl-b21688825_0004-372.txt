He perceived upon the furface of the inteftines and mefentery a great many fmall threads, which, at firft fight, he took for nerves, but foon difcovered his error ; and to diflipate his doubt, opened one of the larged white cords, when no fooner had the incifion been made, than he faw a fluid like milk or cream ifllie from the vefiels. Afellius fays he could not contain his joy at the fight of this phe- nomenon ; and turning himfelf to Alexander Tadinus, and the fenator Septalius, who were prefent, he invited them to enjoy the fpe&acle;—but his pleafure, he adds, was of fhort duration, for the dog died, and the vefiels difappeared. The natural and Ample narration of Afellius reprefents his aftonifhment, and gives an idea of the fenfation, which the anatomift experiences in the inftant of making an interefting difcovery *. Origin of the lacteals. When the young anatomical ftudent ties the mefenteric vefiels of an animal recently killed, and finds the lafteals gradually fweli; when he finds them turgid, if the animal has had a full meal, and if he has allowed time for the chyle to defcend into the fmall inteftines—and empty, or containing only a limpid fluid if the animal has wanted food ; he has fufficient proof that thefe are the vefiels deftined to abforb the nutritious fluids from the inteftines. Again, when coloured fluids are thrown into the inteftines of a living animal, and they are ab- forbed, he has fufficient proof of their free and ready communication with the inner furface of the gut; but the a&ual demonftration of the abforbing mouths of the * Sheldon, Portal. la&eal

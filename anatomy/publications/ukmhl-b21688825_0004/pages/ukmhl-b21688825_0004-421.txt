379 OF THE TEETH/ The external is foft and fpongy, without any vefiels; the other is much firmer, and extremely vafcular, its vefiels coming from thofe that are going to the pulp of the tooth. He adds, that while the tooth is within the gum, there is always a mucilaginous fluid like the finovia in the joints between this membrane and the pulp of the tooth.

The firft, or deciduous fet of teeth, being adapted only for the jaws of a child, are deftined to be filed, and to give place to the adult, or permanent fet of teeth.

The rudiments of the permanent teeth may be obferved even when the fac is very fmall, and appear like a filament ftretching up to the neck of the fac of the deciduous teeth. Thefe facs lie on the inner fide of the jaw-bone, and when further advanced, the necks of the two facs, (both as yet under the gum.) are united; but when the firft teeth are fully formed, and have rifen above the gum, the alveolar procefies have been at the fame time formed around them, and now the fac of the perma- nent teeth have a connexion with the gums through a fmall foramen in the jaw-bone, behind the fpace through which the firft teeth have fhot.

62 OP THE STOMACH. face, which prevents the adion, it is not eafy to fay j but more probably it is owing to the refiftance to its action inherent in a living part. Of digestion. By trituration and maftication, and the union of the faliva with food in the mouth, it is merely prepared for the more ready action of the fto- mach upon it. No farther change is induced upon it than the divifion of its parts and the forming of a foft pulp. But in the ftomach, the firft of thofe changes (probably the material one) is performed, which by a fuccefiion of actions fits the nutritious matter for being received into the circulation of the fluids of the living body, and for becoming a component part of the ani- mal. For now the galtric juice ad mg on this fluid mafs quickly diflolves the digeftible part* and entering into union with it produces anew fluid, which has been called chyme. The mafs has changed its fen* Able and chemical properties; it has fuffered the full action of the ftomach, and by the gradual and fuccef- five mufcular adion of the ftomach it is fent into the duodenum. The contents of the ftomach confift of air (partly fwallowed, partly extricated by chemical change, but frill more in all probability by the heat); of chyme; and of a grofier part incapable of beco- ming nutritious, and the reparation of which from the chyme is accomplifhed by the adion of the canal. Now the ftomach being ftimulated by fulnefs, by fla- tus, and more ftitl by the peculiar irritation of the food to which it is natural to fuppofe its fenfibility ia adapted, the mufcular coat is brought into adion, ancf the contents' of the ftomach delivered into the duode- num. Here having additional ingredients, it is farther changed

122 OF THE LIVER. i lefTer life in the ceconomy of the fydem, and that it did not fecrete the bile. The liver, it is faid, was of the ordinary fize. Now as the bulk of the liver is, in its natural date, made up of the dilated veins, it is fotne proof of what I fhould imagine had taken place here, that by fome provifion of the vefTels the arterial blood had been diffufed, and the celerity of its motion checked previous to its ulti- mate didribution. Nay, it may have opened into the branches of veins anfvvering to the extremities of the vena portae. In the deficiency of the due acrid and bitter date of the bile, there is in this cafe evidence that the bile formed from the arterial blood is ftill unfit for the perfect fecre- tion. I conceive this to be countenanced by the circula- tion of the blood in the liver of the foetus, and by its effects upon the fecretion. We have feen that almoft the entire gland is fupplied with arterial blood returning from the umbilical vein 5 and the natural deduction from this is, that it is the caufe of the lefs ftimulating quality of the bile in the foetus. I conclude, that this fingular and intereding cafe may ftrengthen the opinion which fome have enter- tained that the extreme branches of the hepatic artery pour blood into the extremities of the vena portae pre- vious to this formation of the bile by thefe veins; but it dill leaves us with the general conclufion that the peculiarities in the didribution of the vena portae are a provifion for the fecretion of the bile, and that the branch of the aortic fydem, the hepatic artery, is oiherwife neceffary to the fupport of the function of the liver. Finally,

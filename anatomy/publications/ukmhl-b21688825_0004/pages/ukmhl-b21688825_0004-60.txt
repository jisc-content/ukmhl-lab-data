28 OF THE PERITONEUM, OF THE USE OF THE PERITONEUM, The peritoneum ferves as a denfe and outer coat to the abdominal vifcera; conveys the veffels to them, as in the example of the mefentery; and, having its inner furface fmooth and lubricated by a watery fecretion, it allows the parts to lie in contact (they being ftrongly comprefled by the furrounding abdominal mufcles and diaphragm), and at the fame time allows in the intef- tinal canal a capacity of motion without fri&ion. There is no internal furface or cavity, as it is called, of the living body, which is not moiftened by an exu- dation from the veffels of the furface. Thus it is with the peritoneum. An exhalation from the extreme ar- teries bedews its furface, and is again taken up by abforbent veffels; fo that it does not accumulate in health, nay even fluids popred into the abdominal ca- vity will be taken up by the abforbents *. When the abdomen is opened in animals alive, or recently killed, as in the fiiambles, a vapour is feen to exhale from the peritoneum having a peculiar animal odour. Yet we ought not to fay that this vapour is collettecj in the; * See Nuck Sialograph, c. ii. p. 27.

This, however, proves nothing of the nature or quantity of the fecretion; this has probably been an inflammation and a.bfcefs of the peritoneum, which, we have feen, pours out fuch a quantity of fluid, thin and ferous, as quickly to drop through the bed-clothes upon the floor.

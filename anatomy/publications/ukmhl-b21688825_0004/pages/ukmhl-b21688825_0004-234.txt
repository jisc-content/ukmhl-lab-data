OF THE TESTES, 198 hangs in the fcrotum by the fpermatic chord; one end of the oval, forward and high; fee plan 8th B; while the other is backwards, and drops lower, C. The fpermatic chord confifts of the artery which brings blood ; of the veins which return it; of the vas def- ferens, which carries the femen to the veficulae femi- nales at the neck of the bladder; of lymphatics, which â€¢ ?re effential to the ftructure of every part. This chord of vefiels comes down from the belly, and paffes by the ring of the abdominal mufcles ; it is about four inches in length, and is fixed into the upper and fore part of the body of the tefticle. The body of the tefticle is eafily diftinguifhed, and is the place where the fecretion is performed. It is ftriftly the body of the gland, while the part above it is only the du<ft by which its fluid is difcharged. The ancients called the tefticle dydimi, gemini, twins; they, therefore, called that part which is laid on the back of tfie tefticle epididimis, 'as added to it. To the furgeop, it is efientially neceffary to attend to the relation of ihe parts of the tefticle as felt through thq fcrotum, Eighth Plan of the Tefticle. 8' Phut of do TeJtu-ti. c

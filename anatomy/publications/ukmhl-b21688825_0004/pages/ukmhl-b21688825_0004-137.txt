105 OF THE LIVER, and lower mefenteric arteries. The roots of the portae anfweving to thefe arteries are the fplenic vein; the gaftro-epiploic vein which runs upon the great arch of the ftomach ; the mefenteric vein returning from the fmall inteftines; and the right and middle colic veins, and internal hemorrhoidal vein and left colic return- ing upon the mefocolon. Thefe anfwering to the three great branches of the abdominal aorta, pafs obliquely upward in three great divifions, and unite with fome lelfer veins, as the coronary and fmaller veins of the flomach, and pancreatico-duodenalis. The trunk of the vena ports is now involved in the irregularly reti- culated web of the hepatic velfels, arteries, veins, glands, lymphatics, nerves, and biliary dufts, with their cellu- lar membrane. It paffes upward fomewhat obliquely to the right; and enters the porta * or the finus be- twixt the procelfus caudatus and lobulus fpigelii. When the vena portae has entered the liver, it di- vides into two great branches, which running directly tranfverfe, and being of large capacity, are fometimes called the cylinder of the vena ports. Of thefe two great branches of the vena portae within the liver, the right is greater in diameter, but fhorter f: it ramifies in the great right lobe of the liver. The left is longer confiderably, and filling the tranfverfe filfure it is rehedted up into the umbilical or horizontal filfure, and is given to the left lobe, to the upper and more anterior * Sometimes it has been found divided before entering the liver. It has been alfo found to divide into three branches, in which cafes, fays Haller, two go to the left fide. f Into this branch fometimes the vein of the gall bladder enters. part

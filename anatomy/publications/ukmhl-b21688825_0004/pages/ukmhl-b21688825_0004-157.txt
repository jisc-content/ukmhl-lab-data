12$ OF THE PANCREAS. SECTION II. OF THE PANCREAS. The Pancreas is a gland the larged of thofe which have been called conglomerated, that is,diftin£tly con- fiding of lefler parts united. It is of a long form like a dog’s tongue, and lies acrofs the fpine, and behind the ftomach. Its excretory dudt opens into the duo- denum. The pancreas is confined betwixt the two lamina of the mefocoldn, and it is united to them by a loofe cellular membrane; it lies before the great mefenteric vedels: its fmall extremity touches the fpleen, and is near the capfuli of the left kidney : but towards the right extremity it increafes gradually in maffinefs until its head lodges upon the duodenum. It is like the falivary glands in its appearance, confiding of lobules fucceflively finaller and fmaller ; and it alfo refembles them in the manner in which its dufl is formed. The dufl* begins towards the left extremity by exceed- ingly fmall branches; thefe running together form a middle duff, which taking a ferpentine courfe towards the great extremity, and increafed by the accefiion of the lateral branches in its courfe, becomes nearly of the fize of a writing quill. Now approaching the duodenum it unites to the biliary duel, and opens along with it in{p the duodenum. A valve has been deferibed as in the extremity of the pancreatic dufl, but it is • Ductus Virfursgi. certainlv J

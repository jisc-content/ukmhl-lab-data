121 OF THE LIVER. cf the ufual fize, but had not the ufual inclination to the right fide of the body.: it was fituated in the middle of the upper part of the abdomen, and nearly an equal portion of the gland extended into either hypochon- drium. The gall-bladder lay collapfed in its ufual fitu- ation. It was of a natural ftrudure, but rather fmaller 'than common. On opening it there was found in it about half a tea fpoonful of bile. The bile in colour refembled that of children, being of a deep yellow brown, and tailed like bile, but it was not fo acridly bitter and naufeating as common bile. Mr. Abernethy remarks upon this cafe, that when an anatomill contemplates the performance of biliary fecretion by a vein, a circumltance fo contrary to the general oeconomy of the body, he naturally concludes that bile cannot be prepared unlefs from venal blood; and he alfo infers, that the equal and undilturbed cur- rent of blood in the veins is favourable to the fecretion ; but that the circumltances of this cafe in which bile was fecreted by an artery prove the fallacy of this rea- foning *. We may further obferve on this cafe, that it does not prove the bile in the natural ceconomy to be fe- creted by the arteries and not by the vena portae; for the artery here was unufually large, fo that it perform- ed a function in this inltance which it does not ufually perform. On the contrary, had the artery been of the ufual fize, we might then have concluded that the vena portae was diftributed to the liver to ferve fome * See Mr, Abernethyâ€™s cafe, of uncommon formation of the liver.

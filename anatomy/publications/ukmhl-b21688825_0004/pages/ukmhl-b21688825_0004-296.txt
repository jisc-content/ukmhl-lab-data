-54 OF THE WOMfi. this is not the formation of new parts or new veflels* The embryo is in that ftate of which I have endeavoured to convey an idea, by the term dormant; poffefling that degree of life which is to be renewed by incuba- tion, or artificial heat, but which will laft a great length of time, and, like the germ in plants, be brought to vegitate only in particular circumftances. The traCt of thefe veflels is laid in the original conforma- tion of the embryo and furrounding membranes, they are now merely called into a&ion, and we fee only the efifeCt of this a&ion. We fee red blood formed ; we know that the rednefs of the blood is derived from the membranes, and matter which furround the embryo, and that it is conveyed to the chick or embryo. Before we allow ourfelves to conjecture what is the firft mo- tion in the circle of a&ions which now take place, we muff confider whether it be not more likely that the firft aCtion of thefe veffels is in abforption ; that is, an abforption in the extremities of thefe veffels, or is there firft, an aCtion of the heart of the chick ?â€”We are left to this queftion. Is it probable that a change (hall take place in the fluids which {hall ftimulate the veffels ? or fhall the heat of incubation ftimulate the veffels to aCt upon the contained fluids ? or, as feems moft pro- bable, does the incubation, at the fame time, produce a change in the fluids, and ftimulate the veflels to ac- tion ? To explain what I fhould rather conceive to take place, I {hall defcribe the probable feries of aClions. In common feed, the fmall germ of the plant has its veflels palling out into the lobes of the albumen to ab- forb the food, upon the exiftence of the peculiar cir- cumftances

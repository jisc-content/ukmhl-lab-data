328 OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. In the firft place, as to the terms ladteals and lym- phatics, we prefume that the alpforbents throughout the whole length of the canal have the fame ftrudture and nfe ; and that the term lacteals has been fuggefted merely by the colour of the fluid, which is abforbed from the fmall inteflines. At one time thefe lafteals convey a milky fluid : at another a tranfparent fluid, like that which the ftomach and great inteflines in ge- neral abforb. The ladteals, as it is natural to fuppofe, were the firft difcovered of any part of the fyflem of abforbents ; or, at lead, they were firft underflood to form a part of an abforbing fyflem. For although Euflachius, a Roman anatomift, difcovered the thoracic dudt in the year 1563, yet he had very imperfect notions of its importance, and the difcovery was very little attended to, till after the difcovery of the lacteals by Afellius in 1622. This anatomift, in opening living animals, to obferve the motion of the diaphragm, obferved white filaments on the mefentery, which he took at firft for nerves; but, on pundturing them, and obferving them to difcharge their contents and to collapfe, he pro- 'claimed his difcovery of a new fet of veffels—a fourth kind *.. Had Afellius only chanced to obferve thefe vefiels, his merit would have been inconfiderable; but he alfo inveftigated and announced their peculiar office, viz. of abforbing the chyle from the inteflinal canal, and carrying it into the blood. For fome time, however, after the difcovery of the v^fa lactea, tile opinion of Hypocrates and Galen, * The nerves be’ng counted as veffels. V1Z»

OF THE WOMB. 267 centa. This takes place upon the fame principle that the roots of a plant ffretch towards the foil beft fuited to it, or the branches and leaves of a plant grow and fpread towards the light. The placenta is deftined to adhere to the fundus of the wornb, and there we obferve the accumulation of the large veffels of the womb, it being equidiflant from the feveral fources of blood ; and to this point is the tendency of the veffels of the chorion fo great, that we fometimes fee the veffels of the cord running three or four inches upon the membranes before they reach the placenta, evidently (hewing that the point to which the umbili- cal cord had been originally attached, was not oppofite to the more vafcular part of the womb ; but that the veffels had to ftretch and elongate fome way from the infertion before they accumulate in form of the pla- centa, towards that part of the uterus where there was the greater vafcularity. But the formation of the placenta on the fundus of the womb is not conifant, although there are many provifions for enfuring attachment there. But when it does form low in the womb, or on the orifice itfelf, we then perceive the reafon of natureâ€™s folicitous care in preventing it; for it occafions the mod dangerous floodings from the placenta prefenting on the approach of labour, and its connexions being neceffarily torn up previous to the delivery of the child. The placenta of the advanced ftage of geflation is a mafs formed partly by the accumulations of the veffels of the foetus (the trunk of which is the umbilical cord), and partly of a vafcular and cellular portion formed

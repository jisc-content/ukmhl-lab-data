OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 323 glands are obferved in the courfe of the interna! jugular vein, and even in the foramen caroticum, which are underftood to belong to the lymphatics of the brain. The lymphatics of the head are to be obferved in the courfe of the temporal and occipital arteries, which lafl: terminate in glands, feated behind the maftoid pro- cefs of the temporal bone. The lymphatics of the face have been obferved very numerous accompanying the facial and temporal arteries. But thofe from the internal parts of the face and nofe accompany the internal maxillary artery, and fall into the glands under the parotid, or in the courfe of that artery. Thefe glands are confequently liable to difeafe, in confequence of abforption of matter from the face, throat, and nofe, and their extirpation is a very hazardous operation. The lymphatics from the gums and jaws alfo accompany the internal maxillary artery, and emerge under the angle of the jaw; and fome of them joining the ex- ternal jugular vein, pafs through glands near the top of the Ihoulder. The lymphatic veifels from the tongue and parts about the os hyoides, take alfo the fame courfe. The glands about the face and jaws are of the greatelf importance to the furgeon, for no- thing is more common than the neceffity of cutting out indurated lymphatic glands. Thefe are fometimes miftaken for difeafed falivary glands ; now the falivary glands are rarely difeafed, the lymphatic glands often. And it will be a guide to the furgeon to inquire into the original caufe of the induration, (perhaps a fuppu- ration in the throat, nofe, or jaws) and to know pre- cifely the gland difeafed, its depth, and connexions.

98 or THE LIVER. often difeafed and enlarged as the right, in which cafe it is more difficult to afcertain it by examination, and it mull be learnt from other circumftances befides the actual touch. Neither ffiould a phyfician be ignorant, that by fup- puration in the lungs, and coofequent rifing of the diaphragm, the liver is elevated confiderably, fo as to retire farther under the prote&ion of the falfe ribs *. M. Portal, by running ftilettos into the belly of the fubjeft as it lay upon the table, or was raifed into the perpendicular pofture, found that in the latter pofture the liver fhifted two inches. But it is almoft fuperfiu- ous to remark concerning thefe experiments, that they are by no means conclufive. In the dead body, the abdominal mufcles are relaxed; they yield to the weight of the vifcera ; and the diaphragm is pulled down by the weight of the abdominal vifeera. The margin of the liver neceflarily falls lower, but in the living body there is a clofe and perfect bracing of every part by the abdominal mufcles; they do not yield, and very little if any alteration can take place in the fitua- tion of the vifcera. It mull be obferved, however, that a confiderable morion of the liver is the effect of refpiration, and of the adtion of the diaphragm. This motion is chiefly on the back part of the right lobe of the liver. The left lobe being more on the centre of the belly, and confequently oppoiite to the centre and lefs moveable part of the diaphragm, it is lefs affedted by the refpira- rion than the larger right lobe. * Thefe obfervations in detnil' belong to another place.

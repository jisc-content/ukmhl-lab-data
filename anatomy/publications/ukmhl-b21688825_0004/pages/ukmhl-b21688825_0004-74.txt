OF THE (ESOPHAGUS. 4* * + But an idea is entertained that the one fet of fibres, the circular and internal ones, are for contracting the tube, and the outer ones for elongating and relaxing it. I believe on the other hand that they contract to- gether, conducing to one end, deglutition *. What is called the tunica n rvea is the cellular connexion betwixt the mufcular and inner coat, and is very lax, infomuch that the mufcular coat and the inner coat are like two diftinCt tubes, the one contained within the other, and but flightly attached. This appearance is prefented particularly when the cefophagus is cut acrofs. The inner coat of the cefophagus is foft; glandu-* lar villi are defcribed as being diftinguifhable on its furface, and it is inverted with a very delicate cuticle to dull the acute fenfibility, and prevent pain in fwal- lowing. It in every refpect refembles the lining mem- brane of the mouth. The power, however, which the cefophagus feerns to pofl'efs of refitting heat depends not on the infenfibility beftowed by the cuticle, but is owing to the rapid defcent of the hot folids or liquids fwallowred ; for when they happen to be detained in the gullet they produce a very intolerable pain. This inner coat has an exhaling furface, like the reft of the body, with particular glands to fecrete and pour out phagus feems to be the effcdfi of the action of the diaphragm on the cefophagus. By this accident the fluids of the ltomach are poured into the cavity of the thorax. * See farther of the mufcular coat of the inteftines. *' It was at one time fuppofed that the mufcular fibres of the cefophagus- had a fpiral diree^iion.,, See Verheyen, and Morgan.

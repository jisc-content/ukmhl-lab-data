*33 OF THE SPLEEN. neighbourhood of the putrid foeces in the colon, enters upon the Aril fteps of a begun putrifadtion. By this refolving of the blood it is made more fluid, in which ftate it is returned by the veins, there being no excre- tory du<fts. Now when the fpleen is comprefled be- tween the diftended ftomach and the ribs, and the con- trafling diaphragm, the blood is prefled out from it in greater quantity and celerity towards the liver, mixing with the fluggifh blood in the trunk of the vena portae, repleniihedwith the fat and oil of the omentum, it dilates it and prevents its ftagnation and tendency to congeal. In fhort, the fpleen has been fuppofed to be fubfervient to the funflion of the liver, and to the preparation of a watery (and lubalkaline) fluid to the blood of the portae. Another opinion has been, that it counter- balanced the mafs of the liver feated to the right fide of the belly. Hewfon entertained a theory regarding the ufe of the fpleen which fullies his high character and reputation. He conceived that the fpleen added the flat vehicle of the globules of the blood: his only obfervation in way of proof was, that he faw a few red globules returning by the lymphatics of the fpleen : the effefl, I have no doubt, of the injury of its fubftance, or of the compref- fion of its veflels. It feems to me ftrange that fuch a man feeing the large fplenic artery throwing its full tide of perfect arterial blood into the fpleen, full of globules, complete in every refpecl, and again feeing a few globules carried back by the lymphatics, fhould imagine that this artery formed thefe few vehicles with which it was already fo fully charged.

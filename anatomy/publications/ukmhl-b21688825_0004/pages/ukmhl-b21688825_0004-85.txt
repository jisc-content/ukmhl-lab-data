OF THE STOMACH. S3 the fluids into more general contaft with the abforbing furface, and to give greater activity probably to the ab- forption by the la&eals. I am inclined to think that the ftomach is the mod irritable part of the body, and fufceptible of the mod minute diftin&ions in the na- ture of the ftimuli applied to it. The phenomena of the living animal, and experiments in thofe recently killed, fufficiently prove the contradlile powers of the two orifices. Experiments have been made which {hew the powers both of the cardiac and of the pyloric ori- fices in retaining the contents of the ftomach after the oefophagus and duodenum have been cut acrofs. The ftomach of a rabbit has been fqueezed in the hand after cutting the duodenum, without any of its contents having efcaped *; and in fimiiar experiments, the finger being introduced into the lower orifice of the ftomach of an animal yet warm, the fibres of the pylorus were found to contract ftrongly upon it. Upon forcibly compreflmg the ftomach, the food will be made to pafs into the oefophagus much more readily than into the duodenum; which is another proot how neceftary the natural feries of actions is to the relaxation of the pylorus. Of vomittNG.—When there is an unufual or un- natural irritation on the ftomach, or when it is violent- ly ftimulated or oppofed in its natural courle of action, the motion becomes inverted ; and drawing by Jympa- thy other mufcles to its aid, the contents ot the ftomach are evacuated by vomiting.

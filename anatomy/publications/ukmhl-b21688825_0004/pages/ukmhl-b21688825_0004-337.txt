The mufcularity of thefe veflfels is rather inferred than proved : it is inferred from the unaflided action which they have to perform in prefling the abforbed fluids onward to the heart. Neverthelefs we fometimes fee the lymphatics of the lower extremi- ties of a colour fo red and flelhy, that we may fay their mufcularity is demondrable. The lymphatics feem to poflefs little elaflicity ; when they are blown into, they rife with the flighted force, and remain didended, although the pafiage of the air forward be uninterrupted : whereas, had they confider- able eladicity, they would contrad and difappear. In- deed, when empty, in the dead body they may be rather faid to be collapfed than contraded.â€”Although the lymphatics can be didended with the flighted inflations, yet when didended, as we have already obferved, they firmly refid further dilatation. This is a quality necef- fary to their valvular drudure, for if they were eladic beyond this degree of dilatation, the caliber of the veflel would be occafionally fo enlarged as to render the valves incapable of meeting, and of preventing the retrograde movement of the fluids.

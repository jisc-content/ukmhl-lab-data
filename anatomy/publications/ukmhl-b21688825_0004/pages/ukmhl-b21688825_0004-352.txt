310 OF THE AESORPTION OF SOLIDS. fubfides, there can be no means of exciting abforption ; that when preffure is made on a part, and that part is abforbed, this is a ilrange way of flimulating ? Or when we bleed, is it not odd that this fhould give new power to the lymphatic fyflem ? for thefe are the means of giving a counter irritation, and of fupprefling adion. Mr. Hunter has given to the lymphatics not only the grovelling qualities of animals, as eating ; but the higher attributes of intellect. They do nothing with- out forethought and intention ; when they abforb, it is becaufe they have found the parts ufelefs in the ceconomy. He has carried this notion fo far, that he does not only fpeak of the abforption of the thymus gland, membrana pupillaris, alveoli of the teeth, &c.; but of the body in fever as a confequence of its be- coming ufelefs when under difeafe '.-â€”The following may perhaps appear to be the more natural fuppofition : In a living body we may obferve the agency of the nervous, vafcular, and abforbing fyftems: and the phenomena of life are not to be attributed to any one, but to the whole of thefe. We muff alfo ob- ferve, that life, or the mutual adion of parts pro- ducing the phenomena of life, is proceeding from excitement, and as in the whole fytlem, fo in the individual parts of the body, the healthy adion depends on the influence of this excitement to adion. The tendency of the growth of the body to peculiar forms, and the increafe of parts in difeafe are produced by it. It ads upon the vafcular fyflem in difeafe, by producing increafed adion and fecretion ; as a rnufcle, in the ufe o.f frequent and flrong adion, will become more flefhy and vafcular; as a gland, will be excited to greater adion

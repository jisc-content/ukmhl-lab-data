57 OF THE STOMACH, the as the third diftinft coat of the ftomach, it is conne&ed with the mufcular coat by the second cellular coat, and with the villous coat by the third cellu- lar coat, Striftly, however, it is the fame cellular membrane, taking here a loofer texture to allow of the free interchange and ramification of veffels. When macerated, it fwells and becomes like fine cotton, but has firmer and aponeurotic-like filaments interfering it, and it can be blown up fo as to demonftrate its cellular ftru£ture *. It is in this coat that anatomifts have found fmall glandular bodies lodged, efpecially towards the extremities or orifices of the ftomach. Villous coat.—This is the inner coat, in which the veffels are finally diftributed and organized to their particular end. It is of greater extent than the outer coats of the ftomach ; which neceffarily throws it into folds or plicae. Thele folds take, in different animals, a variety of forms: but they are fimple in man ; from the eefophagus they are continued in a ftellated form upon the orifice, but form no valve here. In the body of the ftomach they are more irregular, fometimes retiform, and fometimes they form circles or fquares, but they have generally a tendency to the longitudinal dire&ion. In the pyloric orifice the villous coat forms a ring, called the valve of the pylorus, which, how- ever, has no refemblance to a valve in its form or ac- tion. This ring is not formed by the inner coat of the ftomach alone, but by the inner flratum of fibres of the mufcular coat, the vafcular and cellular coats, and * Winflow, feet. viii. p. 64.

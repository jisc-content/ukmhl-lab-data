THE WOMB. anfwers to the Falopean tubes in woman and Quad- rupeds. While yet in the egg-bed, the cicatricula, or embryo, is feen to be included in its membranes, upon the furface, or in the membrane of the yolk ; as the yolk, and the imbibed cicatricula, paflfes through the uterus, the yolk, in a moll curious way, has the ad- dition of the other part of the egg. The uterus of a bird is not like that of other quadrupeds or viviparous animals, fimply for the reception of the ovum ; but it is long and convoluted like the inteftines. And the yolk, as it drops into the upper part of it, collects as it paflfes alongft the uterus, the white of the egg, which is a fecretion from it. As it proceeds downwards, it receives the membranes of the white, and before it is excluded, it is coated with the fhell to preferve it from injury when it fhall be dropt from the hen. In the fully formed and incubated egg this is the fituation of the parts. Under the fhell is a membrane which in- verts the whole parts, but leaves a fpace containing air in the greater end betwixt it and the fhell. Within this membrane the glarry white of the egg is contained, and within the white or albuminous matter is the yolk. Under the membrane of the yolk, there is a fmall fpot of a lighter yellow than the yolk. This, upon exami* nation is found to be a vehicle, and within it we fee a leflfer circle formed by an inner vehicle: this is cica* tricula, and within this the rudiments of the chick are contained. We may obferve, that the yolk is fpeci- fically lighter than the white; again, it is fixed, towards the two extremities of the egg to the albumen, or white, by the chalaza. Thefe are like twifted cords, which arife from the yolk, and expand in the white, 12 fo

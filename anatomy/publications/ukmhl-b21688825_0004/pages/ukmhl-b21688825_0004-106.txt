74 OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. The mefentery begins at the laft turn of the duode- num, or beginning of the jejunum, Its root runs obliquely from left to right acrofs the fpine. Here it has no great extent; but as it is prolonged toward the inteftines, it fpreads like a fan, fo that its utmoft margin is of very great extent; which may be con- ceived when we confider that it is attached to the whole extent of the frhall inteftines. In the middle of the fmall inteftine, the mefentery has its greatefl extent or breadth ; towards the beginning of the duodenum and the termination of the ilion, it is fhorter, and more clofely binds down the inteftine. MUSCULAR COAT OF THE INTESTINES. There is not a more important point of confidera- tion in the anatomy of the vifcera, than this of the ac- tion of the mufcular coat. The appearance aad courfe of the fibres fha.ll firft be defcribed, then their abtion, and laftly their effeft in difeafe. The peritoneum is united to the mufcular coat by a very delicate and denfe cellular membrane ; which in the enumeration of the coats we mult call the firft cellular coat, but which really does not deferve the name of a diftinbt coat; for, as already faid, the outer lamina of the mufcular coat is raifed with the peritone- um, and adheres intimately to it. The fibres of the mufcular coat of the inteftines are fimpler than thofe of the ftomach; for here there are only two fets of fibres, the longitudinal and circular fibres. The outer ftratum confifts of the very minute and delicate longi- 4 tudinal

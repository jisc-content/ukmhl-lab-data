OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. X)\ ip. their motions, the fasces remain too long in the cells of the colon, and become hard balls or fcibulas. But when in this date of coftivenefs the inteftines are ex- cited by medicine, not only is the periftaltic motion of the inteftines increafed, but the veiTels pour out their fecretions, loofening and diflolving the fcibulte *, MUSCULAR COAT. The ligamentous-like bands of the colon form three fafciculi running in the length of the gut: one ofthefe, obfcured by the adhefion of the omentum, is not feen without diffeftion; and the other is concealed by the mefocolon f. Thefe bands are formed by the longi- tudinal fibres of the gut, being concentrated into fafci- culi, and not uniformly fpread over the general furface, as in the fmall inteftines : and being at the fame time more firmly connected with the peritoneal coat, they give the appearance outwardly of ligament more than of mufcular fibres The inner or circular mufcular fibres of the great inteftines are like thofe of the fmall inteftines, uniformly fpread over their furface, and are ftronger than thofe of the latter. Faeces. That the food digefted, in part abforbed, and its fluids exhaufted, becomes faeces in its progrefs through the inteftines, will be univerfally allowed: * See note of the pores of the inteftines. f Stratum liberum, ftratum omentale &tertium Mefocolicum.

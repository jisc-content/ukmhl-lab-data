OF THE STOMACH. ^3 changed in its nature, and approximates more to that of the fluids circulating in the veflels. It is called chyle; it has become a white milky fluid, which by the property of the living furface of the villous coat is feparated from the mafs, and abforbed by the ladteai veflels of the inteftines *. -Hunger and thirst. ,We are folicited to take food by the uneafy fenfation of hunger, and by the anticipation of the voluptuous fating of the appetite, and by the pleafures of the palate. Hunger is confi- dered as the eftett of the attrition of the fenfible coats of the ftomach upon each other by the periftaltic mo- tion of the ftomach and compreflion of the vifcera. This appears to be too mechanical an explanation. If the fenfation proceeded merely from fuch attrition of the coats of the ftomach, food received into the ftomach would be more likely to aggravate than to. afluage the gnawing of hunger; to excite the aftion of the ftomach would be to excite the appetite, and an irritable ftomach would be attended with a voracious defire of food. Something more than mere emptinefe is required to produce hunger. There appears to be a deficiency of the due ftimulus to the ftomach, and a confequent uneafy fenfation which is allayed by fulnefs. Hunger does not appear to be occafioned by ftimulus, but by a want of due excitement, by which the irrita- bility of the coats and adion of the veflels are as it were fullered to accumulate; and this tenfion, and irritation, and fulnefs of veflels, is relieved by the food, * See fan her of the lacteal and abforbent fyllem.. which

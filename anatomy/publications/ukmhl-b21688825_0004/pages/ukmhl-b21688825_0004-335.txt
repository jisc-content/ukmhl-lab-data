Following this Ample view, although the abforbent fyftem be commonly divided into the thoracic duCt, lymphatics, laCteals, and glan- dular apparatus attached to them, I (hall throw the prefent feCtion into the divifions of the lymphatics and of the lacteals. SECTION II. OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR. The lymphatic vefiels are tubes whofe coats are perfectly pellucid, having a remarkable power of con- traction, which caufes them to (hrink, and difap- pear, fo as to render it difficult to demonftrate them. Indeed they are only to be obferved by an eye accuf- tomed to the making of lymphatic injections. They are called lymphatics, or ductus aquosI, from their tranfmitting a fluid colourlefs as water. When they are didended with their fluids, they (how that they poffidâ€™s a very diflinCt character from the other circulating tubes. They are irregularly diftended, knotty, and fometirnes like a chain of beads, or little irregular veflcles connected together. This irregularity is owing to their numerous valves, which are femilunar membranes, like thofe of the veins, and hungacrofs their cavities, fo as to catch and interrupt the refluent lymph. They fay, in general, that in the fpace of an inch the

THE ANATOMY OF THE PARTS IN THE FEMALE PELVIS. TPhere is confiderable difficulty in prefenting fuch a view of the anatomy of the parts of generation in, woman, as may bear a due relation to this general fyftem of anatomy, and, at the fame time, be intelli- gible and complete. The fubjeft is in itfelf extenfive and important, fufficient to fill feveral volumes: it is much connefted with practice; and the pha-nomeiu and difeafes of the fyftem ferve greatly to illuftrate the ftrid anatomy of the parts. I cannot here be allowed to give to it its due importance, whilft yet it is a fub- jeÂ£t not eafily underftood from a ffiort abftraft. The parts of generation are divided into the exter- nal, which are thofe without the pelvis; and the inter- nal, or vifcera of the pelvis, and which lie within the bony circle of the pelvis.

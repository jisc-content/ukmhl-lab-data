INTRODUCTION. fecond comprehends the fluids of infenfible tranfpira* tion, the fweat, mucus, cerumen, urine, foeces. And the lajt diviflon comprehends the faliva, the tears, the bile, the pancreatic juice, the gaftric and the intef* tinal juice, the milk, and the feminal fluid. To attend to their arrangements of the folid parts of animals would be equally far from ferving any ufeful end ; for they have thrown together parts fo difcordant in func- tion and fo unlike in ftrudure that they can be of no ufe in a general view of the ceconomy, and cannot in chemical analyfis fhew a uniform refult *. Perhaps all the corrednefs to which we can at pre- fent pretend is fome fuch diviflon as this. Befide3 forming the folid mafs of the animal body, thefe fecretions are drawn from the blood : fluids which are fubfervient to the aflimilating of new matter to the fyftem; fluids which are ufeful in preferving the mo- bility of parts $ and, laftly, the fecretions which con- vey away the wafle and debris of the body, which is fucceflively replaced by the appofition of new matter. From this fliort view of the fyftem we underftand how inceflantly the powers are fpent in adion, and the fluids exhaufted by depofttion and fepretion, and how eflential to life the fundions of thofe parts are which ad upon and aflimilate the food. It is the confidera- tion of thefe parts ivhich forms the fubjed of the firft: fedion of the prefent volume. As in the conflderation of thefe fundions the ftrudure of the glandular organs becomes a chief fubjed of inquiry, it. will be natural at prefent to confider in a general way the opinions * See Fourcroyâ€™s Analyfls of Animal Subftances. which

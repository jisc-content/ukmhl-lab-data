The commencement of the minute branches of the veins, is from the extreme ramifications of the arteries; they are continuous, and perpetuate the motion of the blood in that courfe which is called the circulation. In contemplating the capillary tiffue of vefiels, the moft ftriking circumftance is, the predominance of the dark venous ramifications : and in general, two fets of veins will even in thefe minute ramifications, be ob- ferved ; one fuperficial, the other more intimately blended with thefe minute ramifications of the arteries ; but in the internal parts of the body, and particularly the vifcera, the veins uniformly accompany the rami- fications of the arteries, and in the folid vifcera, a denfe cellular membrane gives promifcuous lodgement, to both fets of vefiels. In the extremities and head, indeed every where but in the vifcera, the veins form two diftinft fets; the deep and the fuperficial veins : the deep veins accompa- nying the arteries; and the fubcutaneous veins, which emerge from the compreffion of the mufcles, and run above the fafcia. The union betwixt the branches of the veins, is very frequent, not only betwixt the veins, ramifying in the fame plane in fo much as to make them a mere n twork ; but alfo betwixt the deep and the fuperficial fet cf veins: fuch are the venae emifiariae of

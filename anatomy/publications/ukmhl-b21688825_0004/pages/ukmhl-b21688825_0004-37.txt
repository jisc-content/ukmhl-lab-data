introduction. 7 into the right fide of the heart, where they are re« ceived into the vortex of the circulating red blood, Thefe fluids, now agitated and wrought up with the blood in the cavities of the heart, are fent through the circulation of the lungs, and fubmitted to the influence of their a£lion and the expofure to the atmofpheric air. When chyle is formed in the ftomach and inteflines, it is obferved to conflfl; of albumen, ferum, globules, and falts: but the change which it may undergo by its reception into the ladleals, its being depofited in their glands, its mingling with the lymph, its agitation in the heart, have not been obferved, though it is natural to fuppofe that by degrees it aflimilates in its nature to that of the circulating blood, and does at lafl become perfe&Iy fimilar by the operation of the lungs. By the expofure of the circulating fluids to the at- mofphere in the lungs a gas is abforbed, which becomes an aftive principle in the blood, and from the blood is communicated to the folids. That the blood of an animal has properties which diftinguifh it from mere matter we readily allow j but to fay that it poflefles life is to ufe a term in which few will acquidfce. It poflefles properties while circulating in the veflels diftinft from thofe which it fhews out of the body j and thefe do not depend on the agitation and inceflant motion, nor on the degree of heat, nor on any fimilar circumftance, but apparently on fome fecret influence which the veflels exert over it. The analyfis of the blood by the chemifls holds out to us little hope of advancing in the knowledge of the ceconomy of a living animal. Chemiftry, when applied to the ana- B 4 lyfis

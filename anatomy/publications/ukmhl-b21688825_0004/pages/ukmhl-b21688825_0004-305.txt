OF THE WOMB. 263 In this plan we ihall be able to obferve the relations and inflections of the uterine membranes or decidua, as OF THE ADDITIONAL MEMBRANES WHICH THE OVUM RECEIVES FROM THE UTERUS. While the ovum is taking the changes confequent upon impregnation, the womb partaking of the gene* ral fympathy which prevails over the whole uterine fyftem, takes a change adopting it for its reception. The fir ft appearance of aCtion is marked by a greater activity of the veflels, a fwelling and foftnefs of its fubftance. While on the inner furface there is an exudation which being converted into a fpongy mem- brane, is peculiarly adapted for the reception and ad- hefion of the ragged and vafcular furface of the ovum.

380 APPENDIX. The opinioh now entertained, that the fecond fet of teeth pufhes out the firft, is very erroneous, for the change on the deciduous and the growing teeth feems to be influenced by laws of coincidence indeed, but not of mechanical adtion. Sometimes we obferve the falling tooth wafted at the root, or on the fide of the fang, by the preflure of the rifing tooth. Now here we fhould fuppofe that the newly-formed tooth fhould be the rnoft apt to be abforbed by the preflure of the root of the deciduous tooth, did we not recolledt that the new tooth is inverted with the hard enamel, while the preflure on the other adls -upon the bony root. But there is more than this in the phenomenon of the fhedding of the teeth, for often the fang is wafted while the tooth adheres only by the gum, and the permanent tooth has made little progrefs in its elevation, and has not prefled upon it. This decay and wafting of the fangs of the teeth looks more like a fatisfaclory proof in fupport of their vafcularity, than any other change to which they are fubjedl. Yet there feems to be no reafon why wâ€™e fhould not fuppofe, that as the rudiments of the teeth rife into adtion at a particular time, and form the bony centre of the tooth, this formation fhould be effedted by fimilar lawsj that at a particular period the tooth fhould decay, and that the decay of the tooth fhould begin with the deftruction of the fangs. Neither can I refill the belief that the bony part of the tooth has a tendency to difiolution independently of a circulation of blood through it, or of an internal adlion of veflfels, and that as the roots wafte, the furrounding vafcular parts abforb its fubftance.

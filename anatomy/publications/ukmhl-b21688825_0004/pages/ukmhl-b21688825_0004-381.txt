OF THE VEINS IN GENERAL. rr< 1 he veins are thofe veffels by which the blood car- ried outward by the arteries, is returned to the heart. The fyftem of the veins however is not fo fimple as that of the arteries, for while there are only two great arteries carrying the blood from the heart, viz. the aorta and the pulmonic artery, there are three great trunks of the veins, viz. the fuperior and inferior vena cava, the trunks of the great veins of the body; the pulmonic vein, which returns the blood to the heart from the circulation through the lungs ; and the vena portae, which collects the blood of the interlines, and conveys it to the liver.

CP THE -WOMB, 255 Cumftances neceflary to its being ftimulated to adtivity and growth. We have to obferve, that where the tiilt Was attached in its hufk to the tree, it has left a porous part; by this cribriform kind of plate the moif- ture of the earth enters;—that dry fcurfy fubftance which we obferve on the infide of the lhell, fwells with the moifture which alfo penetrates the albumen or kerilel—thd moifture forming combination with the alfiumen prepares it for abforption; the veflels are, at the fame time excited, abfofb, and thus nutritious fluids are conveyed to the germ—the nut fplits by the fwelling of the parts, and the corculum or bud fprouts up.— We find then, that in this inftance the grain, or nut, is brought into adtion by the fluids abforbed, forming new combinations with the albumen or kernel, and the adtive exertion of the living powers, beginning by an operation in the fluids. In the fame manner, I conceive, that the incuba- tion of the egg caufes an adtion firft in the fluids, not in the folids (for thefe are folids according to the ftridteft fignifiedtion of the term ; and ftrong mem- branes, as a little vinegar will Ihow, when poured up- on the albuminous fubftance of the egg). A change takes place in the fluids, there are new arrangements fuiting them for abforption, by thofe circles of veflels Which are laid on the original formation of the mem- brane. The fluids act as a ftimulus to thofe veflels, whofe alternate adtion and relaxation never ceafe un- til the termination of life. I conceive this explanation, which. I have offered, to be more confonant with the; great principles of phyfiology, and an extenfive ana- logy of fimilar adtions in the ceconomy, than that ex- S 2 planatiop,.

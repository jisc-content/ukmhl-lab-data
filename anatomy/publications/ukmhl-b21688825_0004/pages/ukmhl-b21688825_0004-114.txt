82 OT THE SMALL INTESTINES. VILLOUS COAT. The moft curious part of the ftructure of the intef- tines is the villous or inner coat; for by its organiza- tion is the chyle feparated from the general mafs of matter in the bowels, and carried into the fyftem of velfels. To this all we have been defcribing is merely fubfervient. The villous coat has a foft fleecy furface ; and being of greater extent than the other and more outward coats, it is thrown into circular plaits which hang into the inteftine, taking a valvular form. They have the name of valvule conniventes. Some of them go quite round the infide of the inteftine; others only in part. They are of larger or fmaller extent in different parts of the canal: for example; they begin a very little way from the lower orifice of the ftomach irre- gularly, and tending to the longitudinal dire&ion; further down they become broader, more numerous, and nearly parallel; they are of greater length, and more frequent in the lower part of the duodenum and. upper part of the jejunum. Thefe valvular projeftions have their edges quite loofe and floating in the canal 5 and from this it is evident that they can have no val- vular adlion. Their ufe is to increafe the furface ex- pofed to the aliment ; to enlarge the abforbing furface and at the fame time to give to it fuch an irregularity' that the chyle may lodge in it and be detained *.

336 OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. \ they turn outward, and then pafs over the pfoas mufcle and into the lumbar glands. The lymphatics of the kidney are in two fets, fu- perficial and deep feated ; but the former are feldom to be obferved. Sometimes difeafe makes them dif- tindl. The internal lymphatics are demonflrated by blowing into the veins, or tying a ligature and kneading the fubflance of the kidney with the fingers; when they rife, they are feen attached to the emulgent vef- fels, and go to join the lumbar glands, or terminate in large lymphatics near the aorta. It is needlefs to repeat that the abforbents of the fpleen are deep and fuperficial,â€”for this arrangement is general. Emerging from the fpleen, the lymphatics pafs alongfl the fplenic veffels, and enter into glands attached to the fplenic artery in its whole courfe. In this courfe they receive the nbforbents from the pan- creas, and near the head of the pancreas, they are blended with thofe of the liver, and with them join the thoracic duel. . The lymphatics of the liver are the mofl eafily de- tected, and may be injecled to greater minutenefs, than in any other part of the body. Although they have many valves, yet they do not feem to clofe the veffels intirely, nor interrupt the mercury from palling from trunk to branch. The fuperhcial lymphatics, which are fo numerous that we may fometimes fee the mer- cury in them covering completely a confiderable fpace, have free communication with the internal fet of veffels which are alfo numerous and large.

INTRODUCTION. 11 Thus Malpighi defined a fimple gland to be Mem- brana cava cuin emifiario and Ruyfch fays, Glan- dular nullm componunlur ex fola membrana cava cum emifiario, fed prarcipue ex vafis.‚Äù Thefe definitions of glands being optional and uncer- tain, it is necefiary to ufe names appropriated to the feveral varieties of form in fecreting parts. Indeed the term gland is inadmiflible as conveying any know- ledge of the minute parts of which the vifcera are com- pofed. We muff obferve, however, that there is a divifion of glands (till in ufe into conglobate and conglomerate. The firlt implies a gland fimple in its form, the iatter a gland having the appearance of an afiemblage of feveral glands*. Now there is no gland that has not more or lefs the appearance which is defcribed by con- glomerated ; that is, confiding of feveral parts, united by cellular membrane : and the diftin&ion is attended with no advantage. Acini form the lafl fub-divifion which we obferve in the vifcera, as in the liver; they are round bodies, not regularly invefted with membranes, and which can be teafed out into parcels of minute veflfels f. * As the falivary glands and the pancreas. Farther, the lymphatic glands are generally called conglobate glands, being fmooth and apparently fimple in their ftrudture ; but thefe, when injected, take exadly the appearance which fhould na- turally be defcribed by the term conglomerate, confuting of jnany little cavities. Thefe lymphatic glands, belonging to a (diftinfc fyftem, require no farther particular definition to dhtin- guifij them. f See farther of the acini of the liver for example, C 3 Crypt#

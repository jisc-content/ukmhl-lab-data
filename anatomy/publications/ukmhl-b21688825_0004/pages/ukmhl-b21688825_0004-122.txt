The coats of the great inteftines are the fame in number and in ftru&ure with thofe of the fmall intef- tines; but they are thinner and more difficult to be feparated by difle&ion. The villi of the inner coat are fmaller ; the mucous glands or folicules are fometimes very diftintt; and, laftly,the mufcular fibres have fome peculiarities in their arrangement, The molt charac- teriftic diftin&ion in the general appearance of the great and fmall inteftines, is the notched and cellular appearance of the former.

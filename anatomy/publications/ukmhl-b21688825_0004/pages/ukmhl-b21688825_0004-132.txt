or THE LIVER. ioo thence conveys it into the right fide of the heart of the foetus *. The coronary ligament of the liver is formed in confeqiience of the attachment of the liver to the dia- phragm. The attachment is of courfe furrounded by the inflection of the peritoneum from the diaphragm to the liver. It is called the coronary ligament, though it has been obferved, that this attachment of the liver is not circular, but of an oval, and very oblong fliape. It appears, that it is this clofe adhefion of the liver to the diaphragm, which is the occafion of the fympathy of the diaphragm in difeafe of the liver, and the caufe of the pain felt in the fhoulder and neck from inflam- mation, and fuppuration in the liver, in confequence of the courfe and connections of the phrenic nerve. The lateral ligaments are formed by the perito- neum continued laterally. The right lateral ligament, like a mefentry, attaches the right and great lobe of the livef to the diaphragm, and the left lateral ligament connefts the left lobe with the diaphragm, and with the cefophagus and fpleen. FORM AND DIVISIONS OF THE LlVER. The liver is convex arid fmooth on the upper fur* face concave and more irregular on the lower part; thick and mafly behind and towards the right fide; but anteriorly and toward the left fide it is thin, and has an acute edge, fo that it lies fmooth over the iiaended'ftomach. * See vol. ii. p. 17 >. and Plate, p. 173. 4 Great

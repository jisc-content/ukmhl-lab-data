Ill OF THE LIVER. The coats of the gall-bladder are the outer peritone- al coat *; a middle cellular coat, what from its analogy to that of the inteftines we fhould call vafcular coat j and an inner coat. In the intermediate coat mufcular fibres have been looked for with great eagernefs, but none have been demonftrated, although a convi&ion, remains that there are mufcular fibres in the compofi- tion of the coats of. the gall-bladder. This coat gives form, limit, and ftrength to the gall-bladder. The third or inner coat is formed into innumerable rugae, fo as to take a cellular or reticulated texture. Thefe loculi, as we may call them, thus formed by the duplicature of Tt, e internal membrane, are of confiderable variety of Ihape, fquare, round, or triangular. Thefe rugs, and the whole internal membrane of the gall-bladder, have a beautiful and minute net-work of velfels upon them j and in thefe cells there can be little doubt that there are fmall mucous folicules, or pores, or an exudation from extreme velfels, whofe difcharge (heaths the fur- face from the irritation of the acrid bile. The ex- treme degree of vafcularity and reticulated texture of this inner coat of the gall-bladder is not apparent be- fore the fixth or feventh month of the foetus, and then it takes a peculiar texture in preparation for the reception of the fecreted bile. * Like the peritoneal coat of the liver, it feems to pofiefs very diftinft veflels from the vafcular coat below. “ Si itaque ea, a “ reliquis membranis folvitur expletis antca materia quadam “ colorata vafis, ab arteria hepatka et vena portarum v.enienti- “ bus ; videmus cam ne minimum quidem accipere furculum quo *' ornantur nervea et vafcvlofa.” Annotations Acad.

OF THE WOMB. ยฃยง0 When the period for the approach of labour is ar- rived, the nature of that vifcid fecretion which feals up the orifice of the womb is altered, it lofes its vifci- dity, and all the parts are relaxed and prepared for the tranfmifiion of the head; even tho.fe rigidities, ftrictures, or callofities of whatever kind, which would feem to promife an abfolute obftruction to the paffage of the child, yield and relax previous to labour. The aCtion of the womb is at firft feeble, as might be expected, and accoucheurs have marked thefe fiages of a natural labour. lft. The womb has fuffered no diminution of its fize; the membranes are entire, and, of courfe, the contractions of the womb are feeble, becaufe before it is allowed to make fome contraction its efforts are not ftrong. This is a provifion for the firft ftage of labour being flow; by and bye the orifice dilating, the membranes with the waters are felt protruding. The membranes and water is as a foft conical cufhion, gently dilating the paffage ; and in this ftage there ihould be no officious interference. While the mem- branes are entire, both the mother and child are in perfect fafety. 2d. The orifice continuing to dilate, and the efforts of the womb increafing, the membranes burft, and the head of the child preffes on the orifice; then the womb is allowed to contract: this contraction is a ftimulus to greater efforts, and, in a few pains, the head defcends in to the cavity of the pelvis.

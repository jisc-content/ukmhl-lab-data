OF THE WOMB, 2S3 what difficult, and the ufuai funfrion correfponding with that of the adult lungs impaired. This mull be much more the cafe when the child is delivered, and the placenta remains in the contradled womb. No doubt nature intends by this, that the funflion of the placenta fhall be gradually diminiffied, and not fud- denly cut off, that the child may feel occafion for the play of the mufcles of refpiration, and that the func- tion of the lungs may, by degrees, take place of the function of the placenta. When the child is firfh de- livered, the cord.pulfates ftrongly ; when the child cries, it becomes feeble; at firft, the child has ffrong and irregular catches of the refpiratory mufcles, but by and bye it breathes more regularly, and cries lufti- ly. At firft the breathing only renders the pulfation of the cord feeble, but prefently the pulfation becomes fo weak, that it is felt only near the umbilicus, and it ceafes when the regular and interrupted breathing is eftabliffied, and the crying ceafes. The delivery of the child and placenta is followed by a confiderable efflux of blood. But after this there continues a difcharge from the uterus, which is called the lochia. It is like the exudation of blood from an extenfive wound, in as much as by the con- tr icbion of the veffels from which it flows, it becomes ferous in a few days, and ceafes gradually like a haemorrhagy. This open difcharge from the womb after delivery, is no doubt a provifion againft the confequence which would naturaijy refult from the fudden and perfect ob- flruftion, and the affivity of the uterine veffels confer quern on delivery. By this difcharge the activity of the

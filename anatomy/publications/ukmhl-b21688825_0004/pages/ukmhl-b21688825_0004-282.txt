24® OP THE WOMB. OF PUBERTY. Authors have long, with many expreflions of fur- prize, laboured to affign a caufe, or frame a theory for the explanation of thofe changes which we obferve in woman at the age of puberty : and generally, in their theories, they have connected with thefe changes the monthly and periodical difcharges of blood from the uterus, w-hich commences with puberty. Thefe theories have been founded in general, on principles re- mote from the laws of a living fyftem. At this period of puberty, the whole frame is expanded into the full- nefs of feminine beauty; the breads rapidly increafe, and are matured ; the parts of generation are enlarged; the hair of the pubis grows, and the rnenfes flow. In explanation of thefe changes, theoritical conje£lure3 after this model have been entertained. fcc About this time the growth of the body begins confiderably to di- minifh, and the blood finding eafy admittance into the completed vifcera is prepared in greater quantity, the appetite being now very fharp in both fexes, a plethora confequently follows. In the male it vents itfelf fre- quently by the nofe, from the exhaling velfels of the pituitary membrane being dilated, &c.; and now the femen firfl begins to be fecreted, and the beard to grow. But, in the female, the fame plethora finds a more eafy vent downwards, being that way dire&ed, partly by the weight of the blood itfelf to the uterine veffels, now much enlarged, of a foft fleecy fabric, feated in a loofe hollow part, with a great deal of cel- lular fabric interfperfed, which is very yielding and fuccnlent.

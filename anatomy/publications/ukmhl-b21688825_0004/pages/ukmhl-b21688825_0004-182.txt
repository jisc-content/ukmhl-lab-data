150 OF THE KIDNEY. circumference of the cortical fubftance, are refledied inward In a tortuous form, and which, at lad, ap- proaching the tubular part, terminate in ftraight tubes, or are continued into the tubuli uriniferi (for ex- ample at B B). But betwixt the mefches of veffels which are de- fcribed, and which are feen here to terminate in the tubuli, there are beds of glands C C C, whicffiacervulae of fmall glandular bodies are as it were laid in the tradt from the circumference towards the centre, and appear to terminate, or to be connected with the tubuli uriniferi as the arteries are. M. Ferrein has oppofed all thefe opinions in a paper of the Academy of Sciences for 1749. He after ts that the body of the kidney is neither compofed of glands nor a congeries of blood veffels ; that it is a peculiar fubftance, which when examined is found to confift of tranfparent veffels. Thefe, he fays, are wonderfully convoluted in the cortical part of the kidney, fo as to refemble glands, and flretch in parallel lines towards the papillae, where they form what is called the tubuli uriniferi. 'Amongfl: thefe tranfparent tubes, the blood veffels ramify to great minutenefs, and accompany them where they are reflecled diredlly inward to form the tubuli. ‘^M.uch ridicule, he obferves, has been thrown upon the terra parenchyma of the ancients; but notwithftanding he affirms that there is in all glands a fubftance diffimilar from the blood veffels, a gelatinous- like matter, which confifts of or contains thefe pellucid tubuli. r , Tubular Part.—The term here ufed is univerfally received 5 and all feem agreed that the ftrke converging to ' : 1 /

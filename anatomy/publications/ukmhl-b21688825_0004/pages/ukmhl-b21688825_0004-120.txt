88 OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. CCECIJM. We have feen that the ileon is inferted into the fide of the colon: now that portion of the gut which is below this union of the ileon is a round or flightly conical fac, from two to three inches in length. It is attached by cellular membrane to the iliacus internus mufcle. It is not a regular fac, but is divided into large cells like thofe in the reft of the colon, and has confi-. derable varieties in different fubje&s. PROCESSUS, SEU APPENDIX VERMIFORMIS. There is appended to the ccecum a fmall gut, alfo blind; but bearing no relation in fize or in figure to any part of the inteftinal canal. This gut, from its fmallnefs and twifted appearance, like the writhing of an earthworm, has received the name of vermiformis. It is fomewhat wider at the connexion with the great inteftine, and ftands off obliquely, fo that fornetimes its inner membrane takes the form of a valve *. It fcarcely ever is found containing feces, but only a mucus excreted from its glands. In the fcetus the appendix vermiformis is comparatively much larger, its bafe wider; upon the whole, more conical, and containing meconeum ; and in the young child it often contains feces. * Mprgagni.

312 OF THE ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS. I fhould conclude that a part which has ceafed to be of ufe in the oeconomy and is abforbed, has not been carried away by the ftimulus applied to the model- ling lymphatics ; but in confequence of a want of the ufual excitement of the parts to a&ion, and of the con- fequent preponderance of the a&ionof the lymphatics 5 not by an increafe of their aftion, but by a greater uni- formity of a&ion, lefs dependent on the ftate of excite- ment of the part. This more uniform ftate of aftion, or leffer degree of dependence on excitement, will not be denied when we fee them continuing their aftion after the death of the animal, and after the other phe- nomena of life have ceafed. As to the abforption of the body in general from difeafe, as in fever, it appears to be limply the eft'edt of the continued abforption, while neither the organs for digefting and afiimulating new matter, nor the vafcular fyftem for conveying the fluids, are in a ftate to mimfter to the wants of the fyftem, but fuffer under an unufual irritation, which diforders their fun&ion. As to preflure caufmg abforption and producing the wafting of parts, I cannot agree with Mr. Hunter in fuppofing that the lymphatics are here excited to a&ion; but fhould rather infer that the nerves of the parts being benumbed, and the a&ion of the arteries fupprefled, the lymphatics continue to do their office, while the arteries are prevented from depoftting new matter.â€”For example, when we fee a curvature of the fpine, from a habitual inclination ofthe body to one fide, and confequently greater pref- fure on the one fide of the bodies of the vertebra : 6 it

[ 3*4 ] CHAP. II. Of THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. The lymphatics, in their courfe and relation to the fafcia and mufcles of the extremities, bear a great analogy to the veins ; for there are two fets or grand divifions,â€”the deep lymphatics which accompany the arteries in their branchings amongft the mufcles; and the superficial fet which accompany the ex- ternal veins. SECTION I. Of the foot, leg, and thigei. Even in the toes the fame deflin&ion of the origins of the lymphatics may be obferved, as in the limb. For while a plexus covers the toes fuperficially, and runs up upon the foot with the veins, deeper branches accompany the arteries on the fide of the toes. When we obferve the courfe and origins of the greater and lefier faphena vein, we cannot fail to underfland the courfe of the feveral fets or divifions of the lymphatics of the foot and legs. From the toes, dorfum, and edges of the foot, the lymphatics climb up the leg in four clafies. i. One takes a courfe from the root of the great toe and infide of the foot, over the tendons of the great toe and tibialis anticus tendon. It then pafles on the infide of 7 the

156 OF THE PARTS WITHIN THE PELVIS. CHAP. I. OF THE PARTS WITHIN THE PELVIS. We have feen that the abdominal vifcera are involv- ed in a common membrane; that this membrane is uniformly fmooth; and that it has a fecretion on its furface which bedews the whole, and allows the parts an eafy fhifting motion on each other. The parts in the pelvis mud alfo have motion, but they are at the fame time more drictly conned ed; a loofe cellular membrane is the medium of adhefion here: the parts are imbedded in cellular membrane, which is in- terwoven with mufcular fibres towards the lower open- ing of the pelvis, and further braced by the levator ani mufcle. This gives to the whole due fupport; enab- ling them to refid the compretTion and action of the abdominal mufcles, which they mud receive in com- mon with the higher vifcera of the belly. By turning to the fird plan in this volume we find, that the divifion of the parts in the pelvis and abdomen is not well defined; but we fee that the peritoneum is reflected from the pubes over the urinary bladder, and mounts again upon the rectum. The line of divifion, therefore, is the peritoneum ; while we underhand how the bladder which belongs to the pelvis, being didend- ed, carries the peritoneum before it, and rifes into the abdomen. ' 4

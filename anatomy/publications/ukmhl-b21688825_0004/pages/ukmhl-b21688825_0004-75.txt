OF THE CESOPHAGUS. 43 that mucus which lubricates the paflage for the food *. The inner coat is capable of a great degree of deten- tion, but it is not very elattic, or at lead contraction of the mufcular coat throws it into longitudinal folds of plicae f. - In the neck, the cefophagus lying betwixt the cervi- cal vertebrae and the trachea, is at the fame time in a fmall degree towards the left fide. In the thorax it runs down betwixt the pleura of either fide, where they form the pofterior mediaftinum. Here, even when it deicends upon the dorfal vertebrae, the cefophagus lies rather to the left fide; it then paffes under the arch of the aorta, but quickly efcapes from under its compreffion and rifes on the right fide of the aorta, and as it paffes further down it gets more and more before the aorta. This is fufficiently apparent wrhen we attend to the relation of the perforations in the diaphragm for tranfmitting the aorta and the oefo- phagus. Behind the cefophagus, in the thorax, there are one or two lymphatic glands, which were underftood by VefaliuÂ§ to belong to the cefophagus. What deceived I * Thefe glands fufrer ulceration and fchirrous hardening, and are a terrible caufe of difficulty of fvvallowing. + Some part of the food lodging in the natural lacuna: of uhe cefophagus, or fome folid body, as the ftone of fruit4)eing received iuto them, has been the caufe of a fac forming in the pharynx or cefophagus And it has happened that fuch a fac, gradually and for years enlarging, has formed a bag, into which nearly the whole food, that fhould have paffed into the ftomach, was re- ceived, fo as to opprefs the cefophagus and occafion a lingering death. An example of this is to be feen in my mufeuin.

STRUCTURE OP THE PENIS. 169 The whole integuments of the penis are of the fame cellular fcru&ure with thofe of the reft of the body, and may be with equal facility inflated : they are particular- ly loofe and diftenfible, and unincumbered with fat. A third common integument of the penis is diftin- guifhed, and is called the tunica nervofa. Tt is of a fnore firm elaftic ligamentary fubftance. A ligament, however, is not elaftic, and the firmnefs here is mere- ly that of a greater degree of condenfation in the com- mon membrane. It is this membrane, which being attached to the os pubis, and fupporting the penis, forms the ligamentum elafticum fufpenforium. A Gians. B B Corona Gland is. C Cervix. D Corpus Caverno- fum Penis.

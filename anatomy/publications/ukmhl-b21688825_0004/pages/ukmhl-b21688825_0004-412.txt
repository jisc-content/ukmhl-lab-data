APPENDIX. 37Â° feeding, the enamel is not tinged, we have a convincing proof that the vafcular fyftem has no operation on the enamel after it is formed. From the compofition of the enamel, we muft be aware of the baneful effe&s of acidulated wafhes and powders to the teeth : they diffolve the furface, and give a deceitful whitenefs to the teeth; they erode the furface, which it is not in the conftitution of the part to reftore. Of the central bony part of the tooth. The chemical compofition, and the manner of combi- nation of the matter forming the central part of the tooth, and of the fangs, is fimilar to the other bones of the body; but when we examine the hardnefs and the denfity of the tooth, and fee that it is not even porous, or apparently capable of giving paflage to vefiels, we doubt of its vafcularity, and are apt to fuppofe that it holds its conne&ion with the living jaw-bone by fome other tenor than that of vefiels, and the circulation of the blood through it. I muft acknowledge that the difficulty in deciding on the vafcularity, and degree of vitality which the teeth poffefs, appears to me fo great, that I fhall at prefent venture to give no decided opinion. The vafcularity of the periofteum, which furrounds the teeth and veffels which enter by the fangs to the cavity of the teeth, feemed to fhew a fedulous care to fupply the tooth plentifully with blood. As this part of the tooth has often been coloured by feeding young animals with madder, the reverfe of that experiment, which convinces us there is no circulation in the enamel, fhould fatisfy us that there is blood circu-

332 OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. Lieberkuhn’s obfervations of the villi are the moffc accurate and curious. He obferves, that having opened and wafhed a portion of the fmall inteftine, its whole furface will be found covered with little pendulant conical membranes of the fifth part of a line in fize, and the bafes of which almofi: touch each other. From the vafcular membrane, to which they are attached, he obferves there is given off to each villus a branch of a ladleal, an artery, a vein, and a nerve. Fie found it difficult by injedlion to fhow both the vein and artery, the fluid paded fo eafily from the one into the other. He found that the extreme branch of the lafleal was diflended into a little veflel within the villus. And on the apex of which, with the microfcope, he fawone or fometimes feveral openings; with his glafles he ob- ferved the arteries to ramify on the globules or ampu- lulae and again collect into veins ; and he fuppofed that Hill more minute branches plunged into the centre. But he made a Hill more minute obfervation than this. Infulating a piece of intefline betwixt two rings, only leaving a fpace for the entrance of the ramification of the artery which fupplied it, he injected with a column, and examined its progrefs at the fame time with his micro- fcope. As he railed the tube, he faw the artery going in ferpentine turns to the villus, and the inje&ion returning by the veins; at lafl it paflfed into the ampula ladlea, dif- tended it and made its exit by the foramina. He prepared the villi in another way :—he inflated the ampulae, and kept them fo until they dried ; then he cut them with a razor, and found them cellular. This cellular (true- ture Cruickfhanks thinks is the common cellular fub- flance, uniting the vefiels of the villus. When this gentleman

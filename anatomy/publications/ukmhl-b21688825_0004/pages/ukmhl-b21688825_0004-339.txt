THE ABSORBENT SYSTEM. gree of vafcularity. We may further obferve that the lymphatic glands, even in the fcrophulous difeafes, are feldom primarily affedled : that they partake of difeafed adtion from the furface, or from an affedtion of the inteftines, or from the abforption of matter. The ftrucHire of thefe glands has not been fatisfadlorily invedigated ; or the inquiry is attended with infur- mountable difficulties. Some anatomifls have faid, that they confuted of the convoluted abforbent veffels j others that they are of a cellular ftrudlure. When they affirm that thefe cells are totally diftindt from the lymphatic veffiels, it is not fo eafy to underftand them: for ceils communicating with each other, and into which the lymphatic veffiels enter, are very much the fame with a leries of convoluted, varicofe, and ir- regularly dilated veffieis. If we could diffiedt this feries of cells, as Haller did the veficulse feminales, we fhould have reprefented to us the appearance of a con- voluted varicofe veffel. There is a coat of cellular membrane which fur- rounds the glands. This coat is pervaded by a peculiar fluid which has given rife to fome fpeculation. It is obferved chiefly in young animals, and is for the moll part, though not always, white and milky, and in the glands of the lungs it is of a blackifh colour. This is the fluid which having globules in it, was fuppofed by Mr. Hewfon to be the firft ftage of the formation of the red globules of the blood. It is diftindt from the abforbed fluids, and is a fecretion from the arteries. Phyfiologifts have not determined the nature or ufe of this fluid. At

226 OF THE VAGINA, ETC. 2 -â€¢ The The vagina bends gently round the pubis as it were, or follows the axis of the pelvis; and as the interior of two circles cut off by the fame radii is the (horter, the vagina is longer behind than before. And thus (in this fifth ptari) the fore-part of the vagina A, is lhorter than the back part B. We may obferve from this plan alfo, that the orifice of the womb C, projects as it were into the vagina, fo that the finger touches the os tincse, and chiefly its anterior lip, with* out reaching the upper part of the vagina. The vagina takes its curve nearly in the centre of the' pelvisj it is of neceflity attached by cellular fub- ftance to the re&um and bladder. The urethra, as we have faid, opens above the orifice, and that canal is attached to the vagina in its whole length ; and the neck of the bladder is attached to the upper part. In confequence of this natural connexion, difeafe of tha Vagina fometimes throws the whole parts, the redtum, vagina, and bladder, into one fiftulous ulcer. )

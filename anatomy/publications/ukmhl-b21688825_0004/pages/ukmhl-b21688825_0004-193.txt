I 6 £ OF THE KIDNET. from drangury, from calculus, the mucous difcharge is increafed, even fo as to form a great proportion of the fluid evacuated from the bladder. No vifible fource of this mucus is to be obferved on the inner furface of this membrane * ; fo that probably it is a general difcharge from the furface. Indeed, it ap- pears, that no folicules or criptse, difc’narging at par- ticular points of the furface, could have the effedl of bedewing and defending the whole furface from the acrimony of the urine. The great fources of the mu- cus difcharged with the urine are, the neck of the bladder, the proftate gland, and the urethra f. The Ureters, which convey the urine from the kidnies to the bladder of urine, open very obliquely into the bladder, towards the back and lowed part of it. The confequence of their oblique perforation of the coats is, that, the greater the tendency of the urine to pafs retrograde into them front the bladder, (there being a proportioned didention of the coats of the bladder,) the more their mouths are cornprefled. Thus, in the dead body, there is no degree of diden- tion which caufes the water to pafs by the ureters. The contra&ion, or rather the red dance to didention, of the ureters and pelvis of the kidnies feems much greater than the powers of the bladder are able to oppofe; for in ohdructions of urine in the urethra, * Window, however, defcribes the glands, and Heifter and Haller defcribe folicules, near the neck of the bladder, and round the infertion of the ureters. t When the mucous fecretion is diminiflied by a difeafe of the furface, it feems much more readily to allow the calculous con-, eretion to form upon it, Vol, IV, M there

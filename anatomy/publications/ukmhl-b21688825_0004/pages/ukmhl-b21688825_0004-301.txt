OF THE WOMB. 259 is communicated along the tubes and ovary to the ovum; and that neither the femen, nor the aura fe- minalis reaches the ovaria. When we look abroad for analogies, however, and find the femen of fome animals, as filhes, merely thrown out upon the already evacuated fpawn, we cannot readily acquiefce in this opinion of the mere fympathy of the female parts call- ing the young animal into life. Leaving this fubjedt, we have to obferve, that pre- vious to impregnation there is a ripenefs and promin- ence of fome of the ova, that by coition the Falopean tubes do not inftantly grafp, impregnate, and caufe the burfting of the ovum from the ovarium ; but there is an adlion commenced which gradually brings about this change. Whiht the ovary is thus affected, the tubes are preparing for their action of embracing the ovum, there is an increafed turgefcence in their veffels, and an enlargement and fwelling of the fim- briated extremity. When thus prepared, it approaches tfie ovarium, grafps, and receives the ovum, and by a periftaltic motion, probably very flow and gradual, the ovum is conveyed into the cavity of the uterus. OF THE OVUM, AND ITS CONNECTIONS WITH THE UTE- RUS IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF PREGNANCY. The ovum, when it has defcended into the uterus, and is perfect in its ftrudture, is a foft oval mafs, fringed with veffels, and compofed of membranes con- taining the early foetus. When opened, or differed, it prefents three cavities, or we obferve the foetus to be furrounded with three diftindt membranes. The S 4 1. Deci-

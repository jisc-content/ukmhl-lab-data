126 OF THE PANCREAS, certainly incapable of the aftion of a valve, as the bile' has been found to have gone retrograde into the trunk of the pancreatic duft. Sometimes there are two pan- creatic dufts, but more frequently the part of the gland next the duodenum, and which is called the round head of the pancreas *, has an excretory duct peculiar to itfelf, which either opens into the duode- num feparately frotn the main du£t, by piercing the coats of the inteftines nearer the ftomach, or fome- times opens further down. De Graff, Ruyfch and many others have made ex- periments to difcover the nature of the fecretion from the pancreas. Tubes were introduced into the dufts, and bottles were appended to them in living dogs, fo as to catch the pancreatic fluid : it was found roupy, infipid, and like the faliva. It has therefore been con- cluded, from the colour, ftrudture, dudts, and fecretion of the pancreas having fo flricl a refemblance to thofe of the parotid and fubmaxillary glands, that it is of the nature of the falivary glands of the mouth.’ The general opinion has been, that it is ufeful in fe~ creting a fluid which dilutes and moderates the acri- mony of the bile. More accurate chemical examina- tion of the pancreatic fluid has not been made, or has not been fuccefsful in fhowing any peculiarity in it. Confidering the pancreas as a falivary gland, hov/ great mult be the quantity of fluid poured out by it, if,- as we are entitled to do, we take the analogy of the • This is what Window calls the little pancreas, and is fome- tiir.es fcbirrous fo as to comprefs the biliary duds.

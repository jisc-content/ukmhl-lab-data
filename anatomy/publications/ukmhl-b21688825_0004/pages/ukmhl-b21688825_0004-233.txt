197 OF THE TESTES. The annexed plate reprefents the appearance which I have found in my preparations. A, the vas defe- rens by which the mercury was injected ; B, the epi- didimis; C, veffels running up the chord from the great head of the epididimis. There is a duel which fometimes arifes from the epi- didimis, and which has been found to terminate abruptly in a blind end—of this, Mr. Hunter fpeaks in the annexed note *. OF THE TESTICLE IN GENERAL. The tefticle is of an oval form, and of the fize of a pigeon’s egg: it is a little flattened on the Tides: it * “ By a fupernumerary vas deferens, I mean a fmall duft, which fometimes arifes from the epididimis, and pafi'es up the fpermatic chord along with the vas deferens, and commonly terminates in a blind end, near to which it is fometimes a little enlarged. I never found this dudt go on to the urethra, but in fome inftances, have feen it accompany the vas deferens as far as the brim of the pelvis. There is no abfolute proof that it is a fupernumerary vas defevens; but as we find the dudfs of glands in general very fubjedt to fingularities, and that there are fre- quently fupernumerary dudts, there being often two ureters to one kidney, fometimes diifindt from beginning to end, at other times both arifing from one pelvis; thefe dudls, arifing' from the epididimis, I am inclined to believe from analogy, are of a nature fimilar to the double ureters. They refemble the vas deferens, as being continuations of fome of the tubes of the epi- didimis, are convoluted where they come off from it, and after- wards become a (freight canal puffing along with it for fome way, when they aTe commonly obliterated- “ The idea of their being for the purpofe of returning the fuper- fluous femen to the circulation is certainly erroneous, from their being fo feldom met with, and fo very feldom continued furthei than the brim of the pelvis.” o 3 hang*

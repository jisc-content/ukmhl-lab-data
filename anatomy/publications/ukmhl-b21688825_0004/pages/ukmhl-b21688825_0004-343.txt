AND OF THE DOCTRINE OF ABSORPTION. 30I takes place in the fluids of the cavities, the fame is found to have taken place in the lymphatics. But the ftudent naturally afks, how is the lymph taken into the lymphatic veflfels ; and here it mull be confeflfed, there is too much field for c mjedture. It was thought formerly that the lymphatic arteries terminated in fmall pellucid veins: thefe veins carry- ing only the thinner, and refufing the red part of the blood, were called lymphatics. When the anatomifl threw in his minute injection, and faw the coloured fluid return by the red veins, and the colourlefs fluid return by the lymphatics *, it was held as a fuf- ficient proof of the accuracy of the preconceived no- tion, and tallied with obfervations of Leewenhoeck, and the theory of Boerhaave. See. Introduction to Vol. III. When, however, anatomifls more carefully examined the ftate of parts, they found that the lym- phatics were not filled, unlefs the cellular membrane was previoufly injefted by the extravafation of the fluid from the blood veffels. Finding that this alleged experiment was really no proof of the anaftomofis, and direft communication betwixt the extreme arteries and lymphatics, they conceived that it was a proof that thefe lymphatics took their rife from the cellular interftitial texture. Then inje&ing with mercury, they found that when the veffels burii, and the column luddenly defcended, and the cellular membrane was filled, the mercury was feen to rife in the lymphatics. Following up this, they blew air, or inje&ed various * It was probably Nuck who firft injected the lymphatics from the arteries. Vol, IV. X fluids

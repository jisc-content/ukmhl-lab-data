OF THIS KIDNEY. I52 cap on the upper end of the kidney. It is of a form, like an irregular crefcent, and fuited to the lhape of that part of the kidney to which it is attached j at the fame time that it has three acute edges, or takes a tri- angular form.—(See the drawing of the kidnies of the foetus.)—The upper edge has been called crifta, while- the lower edges have the name of lobes. It is in the foetus that the renal capfule is large and perfect; in the adult it has fhrunk, and no longer bears the fame re- lative fize to the kidney. In the foetus the renal cap- fule is as large as the kidney, and the capfules of each fide are continued into each other, being fcretched acrofs the aorta and vena cava. The veffels fent to this body are fomewhat irregular; they come from the renal or emulgent arteries and veins, from the cadiac artery or phrenic, or from the trunk of the aorta, and even from the lumbar arteries. By feparating the lobes of this body we find fome- thing like a cavity, which has been roundly afferted by fome to be a regular ventricle; by others altogether denied. Finding a cavity, they fuppofed they mull difcover the excretory duct. Some conceived that it mull be connected with the pelvis of the kidney ; fome with the thoracic du£t; fome with the teflicle j but every thing relating to the ufe of this body has hither- to eluded refearch, and all is doubt and uncertain fpe- culation. For my own part I rather conceive that this body is ufeful in the foetus, by deriving the blood from the kidney, that gland not having its proper office, of fecreting the urine, to perform in the foetus.

102 Of THE LIVER. - ,-r the liver, ftretching downward from the middle of the great right lobe to the lobulus fpigellii. It is behind the gall-bladder, and betwixt the fofla venae portarum and the fiffure for the lodgment of the vena cava. Lobulus anonymus * is the anterior point of the great right lobe of the liver : or others define it to be that fpace of the great lobe betwixt the fofla for the umbilical vein and the gall-bladder, and extending forward from the fofla for the lodgment of the porta, to the anterior margin of the liver. Sulci, and depressions of the liver.—On the lower furface of the right lobe there may be obferved two flight excavations, formed as it were by the preffure of the colon and of the kidney. On the lower furface of the left lobe there may alfo be obferved deprefllons anfwering to the convexities of the ftomach and colon. But thefe are only the {lighter irregularities which might pafs unnoticed. There are, befldes thefe, deep divifions which pafs betwixt the lobes and lobuli, and indeed form thefe eminences. Umbilical fissure f.—From the anterior point of the two lobes there paffes backwards to the left fide of the lobulus fpigelii a deep fiffure, which in the foetus gives lodgment to the umbilical vein, and which in the adult receives the round ligament, where it is about to terminate in the left divifion of the vena port.e:. The back part of this fiffure gives lodgment to the duftus venofus in the foetus. This fiffure divides the liver into its tvyo right and left divifions, and upon the right fide joins the tranfverfe fiffure. * Lobulus acccfforius—anterior—quadratus. -j- Horizontal £T. re, folia, longitudinalis, longa anterior. rp 1 HE

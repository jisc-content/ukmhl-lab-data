APPENDIX. 345 tra&ion of the heart, and of the arteries fo alternate with each other, in fuch a manner as to keep up a perpe- tual and uniform dream of blood into the veins ; where- as the pulfation in the arteries is owing to the fudden and interrupted contra&ion of the heart. In this general account of the venous fyftem, it re- mains only to fpeak of the fubjedt of abforption. Be- fore the fuite of experiments made on this fubjedl by Mr. Hunter, a vague notion was entertained that the veins were abforbents; but about that time*1, the doctrine that lymphatics are abforbents having been edablHhed, the opinion that the red veins were alfo ab- forbents, wasfird quedioned, and finally confuted, at lead in the opinion of mod phyfiologids. The chief argument to fhow that veins, arifing from cavities, particularly from the intedines, acted as abforbents, was, that fome anatomids faid they had feen white chyle in the blood taken from the mefenteric veins. It was however foon obferved that the ferum of the blood, taken from the veins of the arm, was fome- times white, which mud arife from fome other caufe than the abforption of chyle f. The experiments of Mr. John Hunter, proved that there is no abforption of fluid, from aliment contained in the intedinal canal, by the veins of the mefentery, while the lacteals were rapidly abforbing. Emptying a portion of the gut, and the veins of their blood in a living animal, he poured milk into the intefline. The veins remained empty, and without a drop of the milk finding its way into them, while the ladteals became * 1758. f See Hewfon Exper. EfTays and Lymphatic Syftem. tinged

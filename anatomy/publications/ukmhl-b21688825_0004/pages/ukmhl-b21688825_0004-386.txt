APPENDIX. 344 ceffary change in the proportionate diftribution of the blood, which is preceded or accompanied with other peculiarities, the character of old age. When we con- fider the great proportion of the veins in fize, over the arteries, we mull conclude that the blood flows but llowly in the venotis fyftem : that from the narrow- nefs of the trunks of the veins near the heart, the blood mull; be accelerated, as it approaches the heart, and that receiving the impulfe from the ventricle, it muft take a rapid courfe through the arteries, until again approaching the extreme branches of the arteries and palling into the veins, its motion becomes more languid and flow. In youth, as the fize of the veins is not in fo great a proportion to the arteries, as in ad- vanced life ; the blood in a young perfon, mult be in more rapid and quick circulation : but in old age, ill proportion to the largenefs of the veins and the accu- mulation of blood in them, the quantity of blood moving llowly through the venous fyftem, and al- moll ftagnant in the dilated veins and finufes, is very great; it moves but llowly and progreflively on towards the centre of the circulation ; and upon the whole, the blood in old people, moves lefs brilkly through the vef- fels, and the proportionate quantity immediately under the influence of the arterial fyftem, is lefs than in youth. There is no pulfation to be obferved in the veins, but what they receive laterally from the contiguous ar- teiies. There is no pulfation in the veins, becaufe they are removed from the heart ; becaufe they do not re- ceive the Ihock of the heartâ€™s a&ion in their trunk, but only by their widely fpread branches ; becaufe the con- traction

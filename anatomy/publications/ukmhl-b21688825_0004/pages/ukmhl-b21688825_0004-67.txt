35 GF THE PERITONEUM. OMENTUM COLICUM. This is a continuation of the great omentum upon the right fide of the great arch of the colon, where it rifes from the caput coli; but it feldom extends its origin from the colon the length of the caput coli. It can be inflated like the great omentum. APPENDICES EPIPLOICiE, OR OMENTULA INTESTINI C ROSSI. These are little fatty and membranous proceflhs which hang pendulous from the furface of the colon : they are of the fame texture and ufe with the greater omentum and right colic omentum. We have mentioned that the omenta are double re- flexions from the peritoneum, and confequently they may be inflated fo as to demonftrate them to be perfeX facs. To do this it is not required to punXure any part of them, for there is a natural opening by which the whole may be inflated in a young fubjeX, and in a healthy Hate of the vifcera. This natural opening into the purfe or fac of the omentum is betwixt the membrane involving the veflels and duXs of the liver, and the peritoneum, where it inverts the vena cava betwixt the neck of the gall bladder and the firft turn of the duodenum, or where the lobulus caudatus hepatis touches the duodenum. By introducing a blow pipe into this.natural fiiTure the foramen ot Window, the omentum minus may be railed : the gaftro colic, and colic omenta may be in- flated.

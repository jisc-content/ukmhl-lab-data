APPENDIX. peculiar affection. Others have fuppofed that this is not a difeafe propagated from the one perfon to the other, but produced by the combination of the living principle of two diftinX fyftems! In fhort, the cafe does not feem to be well underftood. Suppofmg it to be the venereal difeafe thus propagated, (and this is the molt likely fuggeffion,) then it does not appear that we fhould confider it as an inoculation of the matter of the difeafe, but of a part long contaminated, ingrafted: and in this view it will probably be found neceffary to continue the plan of cure as for an old affeXion, and not for the recent difeafe. We may conclude that the teeth are peculiar in their fubllance and ftruXure, in the manner of their growth and nutrition ; and, as they are diftinX from the other bones of the fyftem in their form and con- nexions, fo are they in their more effential qualities. Of the gums.â€”The necks of the teeth are fur- rounded by the gums, a red, vafcular, but firm fub- ftance which covers the alveolar proceffes. To the bone and to the teeth the gums adhere very ftrongly, but the edge touching the teeth is loofe. The gums have little fenfibility in their healthy and found ftate; and by maffication, when the teeth are loff, they gain a degree of hardnefs which proves almoft a fub- flitute for the teeth. The ufe of the gum is chiefly to give firmnefs to the teeth, and at the fame time, as Mr. Hunter obferves, to give them that kind of fup- port which breaks the jar of bony contaX. Like the alveolar procefs, the gums have a fecret connexion with the ftate of the teeth. Before the milk-teeth appear, there is a firm ridge which runs along the gums.

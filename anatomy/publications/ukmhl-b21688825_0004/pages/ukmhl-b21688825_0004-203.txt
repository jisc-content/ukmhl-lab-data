STRUCTURE OF THE PENIS. IJ?! iacunre feen; into which the mucus is fecreted, and from which, as from receptacles, it is prefled as the urine flows. The inner membrane of the urethra ft very delicate, and, when torn by the catheter, or by violent chordee, or opened by the cauftic, bleeds profufely. The interna! membranes of the bladder and urethra are particularly fenfible ; drawing after them, when excited, not only the aftion of all the mufcles in the lower part of the pelvis, but having fympathies in a particular manner with the tefticle, ftomach, and bowels, and with the whole fyftem.

Obferving the regular occurrence of an intermitting fever in cafes of fiftula in the perineum, we fhould imagine it to be the efleÂ£t of the extravafation of the urine in the cel- lular membrane, and the effeft of general irritation ; until it is obferved that the Ample ftrifture produces that effett, and that a touch of the cauftic brings on a violent paroxyfm. When the reticular membrane is inflamed, of courfe it lofes its elafticity, and gives pain in erection. Sometimes the inflammation, being continued to the fpongy body furrounding the urethra, makes it un- equal in its capacity of diftention to the cavernous bodies of the penis, and fometimes their cells are united by adhefton in the worft cafes of chordee. I cannot imagine with fome, that the urethra is mufcular ; firjl* becaufe I fee no end it could ferve in the ceconomy ; fccondly, becaufe there is no proof in fupport of the opinior. 5 thirdly, becaufe it is fur- rounded

OF THE LIVER. 112 Towards the opening of the bladder into the cjftic duel the rugae take a femilunar figure, and feem to have a valvular adion, in at leafl fo far that they feem in- tended to give a degree of difficulty to the paffage of the bile. The fame ftrudure of the internal coat prevails in the cyftic duel. However ftrange it may appear to one, confidering the relation of the liver as a gland to its duds, and to the gall-bladder as a receptacle of the bile* an opinion was entertained that the bile of the gall-bladder was fecreted by its own coats, and that it was of a different nature from the bile conveyed from the fubltance of the liver. Without further argument it is fufficient to fay, that when the cyftic dud is tied, or when it is preternaturally obftruded, there is no bile fecreted into the gall-bladder *. From the connections of the gall-bladder, and from the confideration of the whole anatomy, there can re- main no doubt that the gall-bladder is a mere recep- tacle, referving a fufficient {lore of this fluid for the due change to be performed upon the food : that as the ftomach is not at all times loaded with food, nor the chyme and fluid from the ftomach inceffantly paffing through the duodenum, neither is the bile at all times running from the gall-duds. On the con- trary, as the ftomach is emptied of its contents at â€¢ Were there ilo other proof of the gall-bladder being merely a receptacle, and not in any degree for fecreting the bile, the courfe of its veins (which run into the vena portx) would be fufficient indication. If they had returned the blood from having performed the fecretion of the bile, they worn J have drept into the cava, and not into the portx. dated

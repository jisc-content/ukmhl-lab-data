OF THE TEETH. 373 â€¢ that.paTt of the tooth which is above the gum, which may be owing to the mere compadnefs of the offific depofitions, for we know that the bones of greateft denfity are the mofl apt to yield altogether to difeafed adion, and die, inftead of throwing off their furface, in exfoliations, or taking any other variety of difeafed adion. In the further confideration of this fubjed, there are circumllances which will make us doubt of there being vafcular adion in the teeth, arid perhaps incline us to believe that they poffefs a lower degree of life, and are lefs fubjed to change than other parts. Suppofing the bony part of the tooth to be vafcular, and to poffefs the principle of life, is not the firm adhefion and con- tad of the enamel to the body of the tooth a curious inftance of a part deftitute of life adhering to the fur- face of a living part, without producing the common effeds of excitement and exfoliation, or inflammation, in the latter ? Is the enamel, though not a vafcular part, poffeffed of fome quality which diflinguilhes it from fo- reign matter, or is the bony part of the tooth poffeffed of folow a degree of vafcular adion, that it is not excited by the contad and adherence of the enamel ? We muff fuppofe that fome accordance fubfifls between them from what is obferved to be the effed of the lofs of the enamel, for then the bone of the tooth fpoils rapidly, and becomes carious. In rickets, and molities offium, and other difeafes of debility in which the body waftes, or the growth is retarded, the growth of the teeth is not retarded in the one cafe, nor is the grown teeth altered in their form or properties in the other.

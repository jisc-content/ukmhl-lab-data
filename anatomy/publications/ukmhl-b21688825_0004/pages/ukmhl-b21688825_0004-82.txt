5® OF THE STOMACH. regarding the extreme fenfibility of the ftomach, and the gradual and regular fucceflion of adtion, much will be found that is worthy of attention. It fhould feem that the morfel is fent down into the oefophagus by a fuccellion of actions, preceded by a perfedt relaxation $ and that when the food arrives at the fuperior orifice of the ftomach, by the fame relaxation preceding the contradlion, the vufcular fibres of the upper part of the ftomach yield and receive the food comprefled by the oefophagus. Attending to the form of the ftomach, we fee a provifion for the reception of the food into the great facculated fundus on the left extremity. And here we (hall find that there is a greater profufion of veflels for the fecretion of the juices of the ftomach, and a fet of mufcular fibres, probably relaxing and yielding to receive the food, and excited to adtion only when the procefs of digeftion has been in part or en- tirely accomplifhed. We have proof that when the food has remained the ufual time in the ftomach, and comes in fucceflion to be prefented at the lower orifice, if the ftomach is healthy and the change upon the food perfedt, the lower orifice is relaxed, and yields to the contradlion of the mufcular fibres of the ftomach, and the contents of the ftomach are pafled into the duo- denum : but if the food has been of an indigeftible nature, it is rejedfed. The pyloric fibres refufe the ne- celfary relaxation, and by the unnatural excitement an antiperiftaltic motion is produced, and the matter is again thrown into the great end of the ftomach, or re- jedted by vomiting. There is in the natural adtion of the ftomach a ftimulus, followed by a regular fucceflion ©f motion in its fibres, conveying the contents from 6 the

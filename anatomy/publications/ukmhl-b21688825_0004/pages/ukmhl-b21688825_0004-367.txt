OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 325 it was firfl: obferved by Pecquet * to be a veflel which conveyed the chyle through the diaphragm, and which took its courfe through the whole length of the thorax, to throw its fluids into the veins near the heart. Be- fore his time the ladleals which were difcovered by Afellius f> were fuppofed to terminate in the liver. The firfl difcoverers of the thoracic duff, defcribed it as be- ginning from a pyriform bag, to which they gave the name of receptaculum chyli. In dogs, fifh, and the turtle, fuch a ciftern or bag may be obferved ; but in the human body nothing further is to be obferved than an irregular dilatation ofa this veflel, like a varicofe dif- tention, where it receives the acceflion of the la&eals from the root of the mefentery. The origin of this great trunk, called the thoracic trunk, is the union of the vef- fels, which running by the fide of the common iliac vef- fels, are derived from tire pelvis and lower extremities. Upon the third and fourth vertebras, and under the aorta this trunk is frequently joined by a large trunk of the ladleals, and then afcending, it receives the greater number, or the larger trunks of the ladteals. On the vertebrae of the loins, the thoracic du£t is by no means regular, either in its courfe or fize or fhape ; often it contracts, and again irregularly dilates, as it feems to emerge from under the aorta. On the uppermoft vertebra of the loins, the thoracic du6l lies under the right crus of the diaphragm, and then pafling the fep- tum with the aorta, it gets on the right anterior furface * In the year 1651. t In the year 1622.—About the year 1652, the other branches of the fyftem, which take their courfe to every part of the body, were difcovered by Rudbeck, Jolyffe, and Thom.

Some however have made a new diftin&ion, by afierting that a vafcular part is to be obferved betwixt the cortical and tubular or ftriated parts, as at * ; but it is not the cafe ; for although when we make a re- gular fe&ion of the whole gland, the mouths of fome larger veffels will be obferved betwixt the fafciculi of the urinary tubes, yet they are irregular ramifications tending to the outer cortical part, and not fuch as fe- parate the tubular and cortical part, nor fo regular as to be confidered as one of the fubdivifions of the kidney. OF THE CORTICAL PART. The external and cortical part of the kidney is by all allowed to be the fecreting, or, as they rather term it, the fecerning part of the organ. It was this part which the older writers confidered as in a more particular manner to confifl of a peculiar flefhy fubftance or pa- renchymatous matter.

The appearances which he de- fcribes are to be very diflindtly feen in many animals; for example, in the hone’s and cow’s kidney; and are to be feen reprefented in thefe plates; But he afferted thefe bodies to be alfo obfervable in the human kid- ney ; to demonllrate which he ejefted a black liquid mixed with fpirit of wine, by which the kidney becom- ing univerfally tinged, you may then fee, he faid, when you have torn oil the coats of the kidney, fmall glands partaking

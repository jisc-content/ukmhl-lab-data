OF THE (ESOPHAGUS. 41 with mufcular fibres, which take their origin from the neighbouring points of bone ; as the ftyloid procefs, the horns of the Os hyoidis, the thyroid cartilage * ; by which it is enabled to grafp and contract upon the morfel when it has been thru ft by the tongue behind the ifthmus faucium. This ftrong tiffue of mufcular fibres which furrounds the pharynx, is continued down upon the cefophagus in the form of a (heath, which has been called vaginalis tunica. STRUCTURE OF THE OESOPHAGUS. I believe we can with propriety enumerate no more than two proper coats of the cefophagus ; its mufcular and internal coat: for that which is fometimes confi- dered as the outer coat, is only the adventitious cellular membrane, and the nervous coat is merely cellular tiffue connecting the mufcular and inner coat. The muscular coat of the cefophagus greatly fur- paffes in ftrength and in the coarfenefs of its fibres any part of the whole tract of the infeftina! canal. There may be very diftinftly obferved in it two layers of fibres; an external one confiding of ftrong longitudi- nal fibres, and an internal one of circular fibres. Thefe lamina of fibres are more eafily feparated from each other than thofe in any other part of the body f. But # See vol. i. p. 228. f It appears that the oefophagus can be ruptured in two ways: acrofs, by the tearing of the longitudinal fibres , and longitudi- nally, by the feparatk.11 of the longitudinal fibres,. This, though a rare accident, takes place in violent vomiting or {training to vomit, and, in the nrlt inltance, the tearing acrofs ot the cefo- phagus

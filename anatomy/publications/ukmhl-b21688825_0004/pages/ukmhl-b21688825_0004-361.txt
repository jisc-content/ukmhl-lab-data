OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 319 the brim of the pelvis, and on the hypogaftric veffels, the glands are called the internal iliac glands. In proportion to the frequency of difeafe in the pelvis, thefe external iliac glands, being in the tradt of the lymphatics of the private parts and redtum, See. are particularly fubjedt to difeafe. Thofe glands alfo which are called sacral glands, as lying on the mefo-redtum, and in the hollow of the facrum, have been obferved to be often difeafed. Oil the pfoas mufcle, and on the loins it is impolfible to trace the velfels as fingle trunks; we may obferve that one net-work of velfels afeends upon each pfoas mufcle from the thigh ; that there it is joined by the lymphatics of the pelvis. Thefe velfels are in a manner united by thofe which cover the prominency of the facrum, and pafs under the bifurcation of the aorta. The two great lumbar plexus of lymphatics continuing their afeenr, many of the velfels enter into the lumbar glands; and on the loins they are joined by the abforb- ents of the tellicle. By the union of the lymphatics afeending from the right and left fide, with feveral large trunks of the ladteals from the root of the me- fentery, the thoracic duct is formed on the third and fourth vertebra of the loins. of the lymphatics of the arm. In the arm, as in the leg and thigh, there are two fets of lymphatics:â€”the fuperficial and deep feated. The firfl: of thefe accompany the cutaneous veins, the latter the deep arteries. Y 2 As

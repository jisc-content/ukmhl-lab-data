OF THE TESTIS. I91 The cremaster muscle, as we have feen in the firft volume, takes its origin from the internal oblique mufcle of the abdomen, and, paffing down over the vef- fels of the cord, is expanded on the tunica vaginalis: its ufe is to fufpend the tefticle, and prevent it from dragging upon the veflels of the chord. By conftitutional weaknefs, or the relaxation in- duced by warm climates, this mufcle becomes relaxed, and artificial fufpenfion becomes necefiary. Some- times this mufcle draws the tefticle fpafmodically to the groin ; yet I cannot allow that this is the mufcle which retrafts and corrugates thefcrotum, for the tefticle will be thus drawn up by the cremafter, without corruga- tion or contraction of the fcrotum. In fome this would appear to be a voluntary mufcle ; it poflibly accelerates the motion of the femen, or at leaft promotes its fecre- tion. Thus we find the cord of the tefticle, as it is called, to confift of the arteries, veins, and nerves; of the lym- phatics returning from the tefticle; of the cellular tiftue embracing and jfupporting all thefe veflels; and laftly, of the fibres of the cremafter mufcle, OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE TESTICLE. It is to De Graaff that we owe the knowledge of the ftruClure of the tefticle; and indeed the merit of this great anatomift has not been acknowledged with fufficient gratitude by modern anatomifts: but after the fervour of difputation has fubfided, the merit of ingenuity and of difcovery muft return to him to whom it is due. No one more highly values than I do the improve-

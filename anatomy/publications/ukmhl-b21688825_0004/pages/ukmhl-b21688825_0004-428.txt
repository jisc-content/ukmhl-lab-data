Thefe, in a few weeks, are fucceeded by the lateral incifores of the lower jaw; then the lateral incifores of the upper jaw. The growth of the teeth is not after this in a regular progreffion backwards, for now, inftead of the cufpidati, which are immediately lateral to the incifores, the anterior molares of the lower jaw flowly lift their white furface above the gum about the fourteenth or fifteenth month. Now the cufpidati pierce the gum; and, laftly, the larger molares make their appearance, the teeth of the lower jaw preceding thofe above. The lafl: tooth does not rife till the beginning of the third year. The teeth do not always cut the gum in this order ; it is only the more regular and common order. When the teeth appear in irregular fuccefilon, more irritation and

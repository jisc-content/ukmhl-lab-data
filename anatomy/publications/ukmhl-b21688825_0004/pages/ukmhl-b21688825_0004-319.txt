Accordingly we find, that at the ufual time of utero-geflation, there are pains excited, and hooding, with the difeharge of the decidua from the womb, although it contains no foetus. Nay, further it would appear from the refult of feveral cafes, that at the expiration of the natural term of utero-gehation, the foetus indicates that it is governed by preferibed laws, which render a change neceffary, and fhow that its fyhem is no longer fit to be fupplied through the placentary veffels, and as in the fituation of extra-uterine foetus this change cannot take place, it dies and becomes with its fecundines, as a load of foreign or dead matter in the belly.

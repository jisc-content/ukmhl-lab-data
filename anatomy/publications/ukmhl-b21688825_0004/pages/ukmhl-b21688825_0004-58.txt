26 OF THE PERITONEUM. The aorta, the great vena cava, the thoracic dud, and the kidneys, are behind the peritoneum; that mean brane being ftretched before them. But the inteftines are alfo in the fame refped behind this general invert- ing membrane; for it is merely refleded from the fpine and pfoas mufcles, and from the great veffels run- ning down upon the fpine, fo as to involve the intef- tines and form their outer coat. As it ftretches towards the trad of the inteftinal canal, it confequently involves the veffels of the inteftines in its duplicature, and forms the mefentery. The peritoneum alfo lines the abdominal mufcles: it is refleded from the diaphragm upon the furface of the tranfverfalis and redus abdominis mufcles. Here it is united to them by a loofe adipofe membrane, and from the abdominal mufcles it is continued upon the infide of the pubes. From the pubes it afcends upon the bladder of urine; defcends again behind the blad- der ; and there, making another refledion to mount over the redum and form the mefo-redum, it leaves betwixt the redum and bladder a particular facculus. From this detailed defcription we fee that the peri- toneum has no termination : that it is continued from the furface of the diaphragm to that of the abdominal mufcles ; from that over the bladder and redum ; from the redum in the whole length of the inteftinal canal; and from the inteftinal canal up upon the diaphragm. We fee then what is meant when it is faid that it is a fhut fac; we underftand by the cavity of the peritone- um merely the infide of this fac; and that when diftended with fluid, that fluid is contained betwixt the peritoneum

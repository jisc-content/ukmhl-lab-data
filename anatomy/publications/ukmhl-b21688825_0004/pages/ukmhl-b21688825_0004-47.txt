Ruysch fludied at Leyden under Van Horne, and at a very early age attached himfelf to anatomy and botany. At this time he brought himfelf into notice by a defence of the profeflors againfl: one Bilfius, who, although he was learned and acute, had attacked them, with all the weapons of a Charlatan. Returning to his native country, he was raifed to the profefforfliip of anatomy and botany in Amfterdam. It was here that Ruyfch made thofe difcoveries in anatomy, and that wonderful and fudden progrefs in practical anatomy, which not only raifed him above his cotemporaries, but has been the admiration of all fmce his time* Though new and various methods of preparing the body have been difcovered fmce the time of Ruyfch, yet there has been no approach to the ele- gance with which he difplayed the Itruflure of minute parts.

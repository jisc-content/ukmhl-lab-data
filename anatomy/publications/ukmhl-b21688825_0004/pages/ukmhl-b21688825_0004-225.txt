OF THE TESTES. *93 Thefe feminiferous tubes of Haller, or tubuli teftis of Monro, running in melhes, 15 or 20 in number, ter- minate on the back of the tefticle. Each of thefe tubes feems to be cylindrical, or of one diameter throughout their whole extent: we fee no communi- cation betwixt them ; no branches given out or going into them ; no beginning for the whole, nor for any one of them. Though we cannot prove it, yet there feems to be only one tube wonderfully convoluted and folded up in each fubdivifion of the tefticle. Rete testis.—When the tubuli come out from the body of the tefticle, they run along the back of it, and communicate by inofculations with each other, fo as to form a net-work of veflels, from which appear- ance Haller named them rete teftis. Here it often happens that the mercury flops, when it has been injected backward from the yas deferens; and it is this part which has been better defcribed and drawn, in confequence of mercurial injedlions, than it was by De Graaff; for he, as we have faid, faw this part only filled with femen. Connected with the rete teftis is the corpus high- morianum.— Where the lines of the membranous fepta, and cellular membrane of the tefticle, meet on the back, of the tefticle, and under the epididimis, they form a white line. This white line running along the tefticle, was fuppofed by Highmore to be a hollow tube; it was compared with the falivary du£t; it was thought to be a cavity leading from the body of the tefticle to the head of the epididimis, and to form the communication by which the femen flowed from the tefticle. De Graaff firft refuted this notion, and fhewed Vol. IV. O that

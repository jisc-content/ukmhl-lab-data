[ 3°6 1 OF THE ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS. On examining the works which within the laft forty years have contributed to throw light on this fubjedt, we at once acknowledge how neceffary it is for that part of a fyflematic book of anatomy, which profefles to treat of abforption, to take the form of a critical inquiry. When the abforption of the fluids of the cellular fub- ftance, or in the cavities, was univerfally affented to, phy- fiologifts did not make lufficient diftindlion betwixt the abforption of the fluid thrown out of the influence of the circulating veflels, and that matter which continued to be involved in the membranes and veflels, and which formed the folid part of our frame. It will readily be allowed that the fluid thrown out upon the furfaces of the body and in the cells, might be abforbed without inferring that every part of the body, folids and fluids, were alfo taken up by the lymphatic abforbent veflels. But phyfiologifts obferving that the folid parts of the body were fuffering perpetual change ; that the whole body and the veflels themfelves were formed, decom- pofed, and carried away ; they hefitated not to attribute this to the depofition from the arteries, and the abforp- tion by the lymphatics. This alternate deftruction and renovation of parts, the perpetual change which the whole body fufiers, has been univerfally acknowledged and attributed in part to the operation of the lymphatic iyftem, without any other proof than a flight analogy. The interftitial fluids, and the fluid in the cavities, is imbibed by the abforbing mouths of the lymphatics on the furface of the membranes; but where is the ana- i°gy

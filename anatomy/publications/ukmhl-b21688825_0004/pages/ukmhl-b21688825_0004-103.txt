7* OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. The jejunum * is the upper portion of the fmall inteftine. Its extent is two-fifths of the whole. Its convolutions are formed in the umbilical region. The ileon lies in the epigaftric and ileac regions,fur- rounds the jejunum on the fides and lower part, and forms three-fifths of thewholeextent of the inteftine from the mefocolon to the valve of the colon. The coats of the ileon are generally defcribed as thinner and paler; the valvular projections of the inner coat lefs confpicuous; and the mucous glands are apparent in the lower por- tion. The feveral parts however of this, which we may call the long inteftine f, do not preferve a very exaCt relation in regard to their place in the belly, but in their motions they may be drawn to the right or left, upward or downward. This however I am convinced takes place in a much lefs degree than is generally be- lieved. There is fometimes found a lufus in the lower part of the ileon before it palfes into the colon; a blind pouch or caecum is, as it were, attached to the ilion refembling the caput coli. 1 have found this in one * So named from its being more generally empty. Indeed the higher parts of the canal can never be diftended, becaufe the contents pafs ilowly and gradually and with little inter- ruption through them ; but they are in a manner accumulated below. f We may then fpeak of the fmall inteftines in general, mean- ing the whole tract from the itomach to the great inteftine ; the duodenum being the fpace betwixt the ftomach and the lower lamina of the mefocolon, the long inteftine being the trait ex- tending from the duodenum to the colon. f4 inftance

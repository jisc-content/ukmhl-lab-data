For my own part, I cannot but fuppofe that, while the lymphatics abforb the loofe fluids which have been thrown out on furfaces, or into cavities—the veins receive part of what is depofited from the arteries; but, which is not fo perfectly feparated from the influ- ence of the circulating fyftem, as that which the lym- phatics receive ; and that there are certain lefs pal- pable, and perhaps gafeous fluids, which they imbibe in thecourfe of the circulation by an affinity of the venous blood, fimilar to the attraction which takes place in the lungs. We muff at the fame time acknowledge, that the conclufions made in favour of abforption by veins, from experiments upon the dead body, are falacious, and have no weight.—It is feldom we can determine whether minute injections have taken a courfe by a natural, or by a forced paflage : neither are the ex- periments of fome of the older phyfiologifls more fatif- faftory or conclufive. Lower affirmed that, by throwing a ligature on the inferior cava of a dog, he produced alcites. He tied the jugular veins of a dog, and the head became dropfical. Hewfon repeated thefe experiments, but without the fame refult. And if the tying of the veins had always produced oedema or dropfy, the experiment would have proved nothing more than is already eftablifhed by the very common occurrence of oedema of the legs, from the preflure of the wombon theiliac veins, or a tumor in the groin, or in the pelvis. Nov/ in thefe inflances the comprdfion of the vein does nothing more than caufe a difficult circulation of the blood, from the extreme arteries into 5 the

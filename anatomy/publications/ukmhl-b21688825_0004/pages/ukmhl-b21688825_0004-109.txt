OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 77 degree of tenfion, or flighter permanent degree of aCtion *. ANTI PER 1ST ALTIC MOTION. When the fucceflive contraction of the mufcular fibres of the inteftines is oppofed in its natural courfe downward, either by a violent ftimulus (the effeCt of which is to caufe a more permanent contraction in the coats, and one which does not readily yield to the relaxation that follows, as in the natural contraction), or when there is a mechanical and obftinate interrup- tion to the contents of the bowels; then is the natural aCtion reverfed. This antiperiftaltic motion mutt arife thus; a portion of the intefiine being conuriCted, and not yielding to the contraction which in the natural ac- tion of the gut fliould follow in order, the motion of the gut muft be (tationary for a time, until the part above is again relaxed; when, the contents of the intefiine finding a free palfage upwards, and that portion contracting and propelling the matter fiill upwards and retrograde, (fince it is oppofed by the contraction below,) a feries of retrograde or antiperiftaltic motions are produced. The courfe of the aCtion is changed j the contraction w From the experiment of Haller and of others, it is proved that the irritability of the inteftines long furvives that of the heart: that the inteftines are in general in lively motion, when no motion can be obferved in the ftomach : but that fometimes the motion of the ftomach continues longer than that of the inteftines. It is proved alfo that the aftion of the inteftine is adequate to the motion downward and the difeharge of feeces, without the aid of the abdominal mufcles.

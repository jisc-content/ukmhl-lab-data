OF THE KIDNEY. I5I to the centre of the kidney, and taking a pyramidal fhape are the excretory duds. We have feen that they were fuppofed by fome anatomifts to be formed by the continuation of the extreme branches of the arteries; but this opinion we fhall venture to fay arofe from the appearance of the blood veffels injeded, which lie parallel and clofe to them. They are evidently trans- parent tubes, and probably the fibrous appearance of the whole pyramidal body formed by them is owing to the accompanying blood veffels. Thefe leffer duds, as they approach the papillae, terminate in larger duds, which finally open into the duds of Belini at the point of the papillae. The papillae we have feen to be that part of the pyramidal body which projeds into the calyx or infundibulum, and from their point little drops may be perceived to run (from the duds of Belini) when they are comprefled. I have detailed the feveral opinions regarding the llrudure of the kidney; and neither do I wifh here to vamp up an opinion from the aggregate of thefe con- tradidory reports, nor have I been able to draw a decided conclufion from my own experience. In truth, the obfervation from one diffedion I have hitherto found fo completely contradided by other experiments, that I mufl conclude there yet remains much to be done in invefligating the minute ftrildure of the glandular vifcera.

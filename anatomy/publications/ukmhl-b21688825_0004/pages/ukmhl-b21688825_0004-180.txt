348 OF THE KIDNEY. jedions, and from knowing that the veins are in gene- ral numerous furrounding the excretory duds; befides they retain the blood in them like the veins. Thefe veffels running in flraight lines and converging towards the papillae are not the tubuli uriniferi, but the blood veffels accompanying them, the tubes themfelves being tranfparent. Yet I imagine it was by thefe veffels that Ruyfch was deceived ; for tracing them from the extreme arteries, and feeing them fuddenly altered in their form and diredion, and running towards the Papillae, he im- agined them to be the excretory duds continued from the extreme branches of the arteries. Window fuppofes the corpufcules, which are feen in the cortical part of the kidney, to be the extremities of the cut tubuli, filled either with blood or with a colour- ed injedion. But this they evidently are not ; for by making the fubftance around them tranfparent, they are feen within the furface, and they are little grains not the extremity of tubes, nor extended in lines. Boerhaave, although he faw in the preparations of Ruyfch the injedion paffed into the uriniferous tubes, yet in the main favoured the opinions of Malpighi ; and having fometimes obferved thefe tubes filled with injedions, while at intervals they were tranfparent or pale, and contained only a watery fluid, he ventured to conclude that there was a double operation going forward in the kidney ; that the pale watery urine was quickly drawn off by the continuous tubes j but that the urine of the'other quality and higher colour was feparated by a more perfed and flower fecretion through the glandular bodies.

54 OF THE STOMACH. folid matters lodge in the ftomach ; or when fecretions of the duodenum pafs into the ftomach, or unufual adtions are propagated backwards upon the ftomach from the upper portion of the canal; or when emetics are taken, which are unufual ftimuli; or when there is inflammation in the ftomach, which, from giving greater fenfibility, produces the fame effedt with more violent ftimuli; or when the coats are corroded or uh cerated ;—vomiting is produced. That vomiting may be produced by the inverted motion of the ftomach and oefophagus alone, is apparent from experiments upon jiving animals, where the abdominal mufcles are laid open, and from cafes in which the ftomach has lain in the thorax,and yet been excited to adtiye vomiting*. Again, it is equally evident that, when the ftomach is excited to vomiting, there is confent of the abdominal mpfcles, by which they are brought into violent and fpafmodic adtion ; not alternating in their adtion, as in the motion of refpiration, but adting fynchronoufly, fq as greatly to aflift in comprefling the ftomach : but at the fame time, the adtion of thefe mufcles, however forcible their contradtion, cannot alone caufe vomiting ; nor has this adtion any tendency to produce fuch an effedt on other occafions in.which the utmoft contradtion of the dia- phragm and abdominal mufcles is required to the com- preflion of the vifcera. Many have conceived that vomiting is entirely the effedt of the adtion of the ab- dominal mufcles and diaphragm. Such, for example, has been the opinion not only of j.

APPENDIX. 34° the lungs; but they have affumed the lungs as the centre j and the veins of the body, and the arteries of the lungs, they call fyjieme a fang noir, becaufe it con- tains the dark coloured blood ; and the pulmonic veins and the arterial fyftem of the body, they call fyjleme a fangrouge, becaufe it conveys blood of the bright vermi- lion colour. This conceit is perhaps admiffible, when intro- duced as an illuftration of the relation of the lungs to the body ; but in the general announcing of the fyftem, and confidered as a bafis of demonftration, it gives to a difficult fubjett an unufual degree of intricacy in the mind of the young ftudent : befides, the arteries and veins of the body, and the pulmonic artery and vein, have that ftri£t and mutual dependence in attion, which fnows how improper and how unnatural it is to make this change, and to feparate them in explaining the ge- neral fyftem. At all events, let thofe who adopt this novelty ceafe to fpeak of the two circulations, for al- though in regard to the hearty there are two circula- tions, yet as the movement of the blood refpefts the lungs, there is only one. By this divifion, the blood returning from the body and carried into the lungs, cannot be called a circulation ; but only when it has pafled through the lungs, and returned to the fame point of its courfe through the body. GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE VEINS. The capa- city of the veins, is larger than that of the arteries ; the coats thinner but ftronger comparatively, and admit- ting of much dilatation. The coats of the lefler veins, arecomparatively ftronger than thofe of the larger ones, and the veins of the lower extremity much thicker and ftronger,

OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 66 the fpine from the orifice of the ftomach until it touches the gall-bladder. 1‘irft it goes in a direction down- ward ; then it paffes upward till it touches the gall- bladder ; then making a fudden turn it defcends di- rectly near to the right kidney, and is then involved in the lamina of the mefocolon ; it then takes a fweep towards the right fide, obliquely acrofs the fpine, and a little downward ; it afterwards runs behind the head of the pancreas and the great veffels palling to the fmall inteltines betwixt the vena cava and the vena porta; ; and then again toward the left of the aorta, but (till bound down by the root of the mefocolon *. This portion of the intefiine receives its name from being ufually meafured off twrelve fingers breadth, or from five to fix inches, from the orifice of the ftomach. I have always preferred, however, a natural and not an arbitrary divifion, and have confidered that portion of the inteltines as duodenum, which is above the lower lamina of the mefocolon, or the point at which it emerges from the ItriCture of the mefocolon. As in this extent, befides being tied down to the fpine by the mefocolon, it has the peritoneum reflected off from it ■at other points, we have to remark the ligamentum duodeni tenale, ligamentum duodeni hepaticum. Although we lhall prefenily treat of the coats of the fmall inteltines in general, yet it may not be improper here to obferve what are announced as peculiarities in * How comes it then, feeing the acute turns of this intefiine, that Ruyfch calls it “ Inteflinurn digitale, vel inteftiaum reftum breviffimum ?” Adverfar.

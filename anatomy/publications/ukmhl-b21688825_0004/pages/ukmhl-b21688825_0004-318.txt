) / 27^ OF THE WOMB, ward, or the ovum taking upon it that aCtion which is deftined to form its connections with the uterus, ad- heres, and is enlarged in the tube, fo that it cannot be conveyed down into the womb. But the molt curious inftance of the extra uterine conception is, where after impregnation the ovum has dropt from the ovarium, and lies in the cavity of the ab- domen among!! the vifcera. Here alfo the veifels of the fleecy chorion fpread, and attach themfelves to the furface of the vifcera. Thefe inltances of deviation from the natural aCtion of the parts after conception prove to us, I think, that from the moment of impregnation there is a principle of life and activity in the fyftem of veifels of the ovum, and that at a Hated period this aCtion becomes fuch, that the efflorefcent veifels of the furface of the ovum, attach themfelves to whatever vafcular furface they are in contadt with. Further, it feems to Ihew, that in the womb, and in the deciduous membrane which it prepares for the reception of the ovum, there is nothing very particularly necelfary, and that any vafcular fur- face will take upon it the fame changes, and being excited probably to fome peculiarity of aCtion, will ip every thing elfential fupply the growth and nourilhment qf the ovum and foetus. It Ihows us how far the aClion previous and confe- quent to impregnation is a univerfal and fympathetic excitement of the uterine fyltem $ that the decidua i$ formed in the cavity of the womb, although the ovum does not defcend. This points out to us hovy careful nature is, that there lhall be a reciprocal aCtion in the ovum and womb, fo as to enfure the adhefion of the ovum,

OF THE WOMB. 27$ and is not deciduous. Here we find, that the glandu- lar-like portion which belongs to the womb may be minutely inje&ed, and no particle of colour pafs into the foetal part; and again injeflion fhows the foetal portion to be merely compofed of the fleecy extremi- ties of veflels, which, however, minutely injefted, do not fhow any inofculations with the maternal veflels; in fhort, here the connection betwixt the extremities of the two fyftems is fo yery loofe, and the filaments fo minute, and almoft like an impalpable mucus, that we can imagine no other kind of connection than that the extremities of the umbilical veflels take up by ab- forption the nutritious matter neceffary for the fyfleni of the child, and that this is fecreted by the veflels of the womb. Inveftigation in every department of natural hiflory fliows a Similarity, and a Simplicity in the operations of nature. Comparative anatomy may be brought with much advantage in illuftration of the very obfcure laws which guide the funflions of the parts of genera- tion. When we turn our attention to the egg, we find, in the firfl: place, that the vafcular fyflem is com- plete within itfelf, and requires no permanent connec- tion with the maternal fyflem to invigorate its action. We find that the artery which pafles out of the umbi- lical cord of the chick, and which is diftributed to the membranes of the white, pulfates ftrongly, and carries venous coloured blood. We find the returning vein carrying arterial coloured blood. We find then that thefe veflels mufl have a double function, they imbibe the nourifhment from the, whice, and convey it to the increafe of the chick; and they at the fame time, T 3 perform

355 APPENDIX. The great cephalic vein pafllng up betwixt the ten- dons of the pedforalis major and the deltoid mufcles, finks into the axilla and joins the axillary vein. The lesser cephalic is a vein which runs up betwixt the pectoral and deltoid mufcles, and finks generally into the fubclavean vein: fometiines it joins the ex- ternal jugular vein. Vena basilic a*. We trace the origin of the ba- fdic vein from thofe veins which, being continued from the plexus, on the back of the hand, take their courfe over the lower head of the ulna. (A confpicuous branch of thefe veins, from the little finger, was cal- led fahatella by the ancients). From this origin, the bah lie vein takes a fpiral courfe on the ulnar edge of the fore arm, foinetimes in one great trunk, oftener in two, fometimes in a plexus of veins ; here it may be called ulnaris supi.rficialis, or cubitalis in- terna. This vein, now rifmg before the inner con- dyle of the humerus, pafles on the inner margin of the biceps .flexor mufcle ; here it forms very free and numerous connections with the internalor bracheal vein; the fatellites and cephalica, now palling up, until it finks under the tendon of the peCtoral mufcle, it joins the axillary vein. The great bafilic vein, or the great trunk, after it has afeended above the elbow, and received the me- dian bafilic, is joined by feveral deep branches of veins, as thole which accompany the bracheal a tery, called fatelhtes or comites, a vein which is called pro- * Brachialis The ancients termed the bafilic vein of the right, arm, the vein of the liver, or vena hepatica brachii, and that of the left, the vena fâ€™pleniea brachii.

OF THE PANCREAS. 127 parotid fubmaxillary and fublingual glands. Thefe falivary glands, although they may be faid to furround all the jaws from the zigomatic procefs on either fide, are nothing in maflinefs and fize to the pancreas. Again, the pancreas is moll plentifully fupplied with blood-veffels. Belides lelfer branches of arteries, the .pancreatico-duodenalis gives two branches, which take an extenfive courfe through it, and are joined by other mefenteric twigs; and twigs proceed from the veffels of the llomach, and even from the hepatic artery; but more particularly we have toobferve the large branches bellowed upon it by the fplenic artery, where it takes its courfe clofe upon it. While the malticators are working, the parotid gland pours out fo great a quantity of faliva, fays M. Helvetius, that it is inconceivable, and what I Ihouid not believe, had 1 not feen it in a foldier of the guards. A cut with a fabre in the cheek had opened the falivary dud: the wound healing on the infide of the cheek left a filtulous difcharge from the parotid dud. When he eat, there flowed from this hole a great abundance of faliva ; fo that during dinner, which is not long in the Hotel Dieu, it moiftened feveral napkins. How much mull flow from all the falivary glands ? How much from the pancreas, which is greater than them all colledively ? Like the biliary fecretion it is probable that the con- tents of the llomach pafling the duodenum, or the bile flowing from the biliary duds, form the dimulus to the difcharge of thg pancreatic fluid ; and as we fee that the morfel in the mouth will quickly produce an .abnoft inflantaneous fecretion and difcharge of faliva, 9 la

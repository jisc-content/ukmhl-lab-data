INTRODUCTION". 6 veffels carry the chyle to the thoracic du<ft, the trunk of the abforbing fyftem ; but not dire&ly; for the chyle is depofited in the raefenteric glands, from which it is again abforbed and carried forward. Or if we fuppofe thefe glands to be merely convoluted veffels, its flow is at lead delayed, fo that it is not at once thrown into the mafs of circulating fluids. We find then that the ftomach performs digeftion, and the fpleen, we will venture to affirm, is fubfervient to it. The fecretion of the liver we find to prepare the chyle for abforption, while at the fame time it is the peculiar ftimulus to the inteftines. The pancreas pours out a fluid which tempers the acrid bile. The fuperior part of the inteflinal canal abforbs the nutri- tious fluid or chyle, while the grofs remains of the food move on to be depofited in the great inteftines. The great inteftines are not only receptacles, but form at the fame time an extenfive fecreting furface ufeful in the ceconomy, by throwing off the wafte of the fyftem. The lafteal veffels, which take up the chyle, are but branches of the fyftem of abforbents—which is a fyf- tem confiding of two great divifions, the lacteals and lymphatics: the firft receiving the nutritious fluids from the inteftinal canal, and the latter being abfor- bents, taking up the fluids which have been thrown out upon the cavities and furfaces of the body; and we prefume upon the folid parts of the body alfo. Thus the new fluids, rich in fupplies, are mingled with thofe which are fraught with the wafte and decompo- fition of the fyftem. The thoracic du£t, the trunk of this fyftem, conveys thefe fluids thus mingled together into

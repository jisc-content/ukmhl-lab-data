249 OF THE WOMB. changes In the female organs confequent upon con- ception, and which we might nototherwife be enabled to underhand. We fee that vegetables propagate their branches in svery refpeCt like the parent trunk. We fee in the autumn the bud lodged in the axilla of the leaf, and obferve it pafs through the winter in a kind of dormant hate ; but when it is influenced by the returning heat of the fpring, it fhoots out to full maturity. This growth is a natural power of propagation, and increafe, marked by no very peculiar circumftance, yet bearing a ftrong analogy to the production of the feed. In the formation of the fruit of the fame tree, we fee a more complicated provifion for the propagation of the plant. We find that although the feed appears to be formed by the natural growth of the part like the bud, yet before it becomes prolific, and capable of growing, and arriving at maturity, it mud be in- fluenced by circumftances fimilar to the union of the fexes of animals; that its power of reproduction de- pends upon the reciprocal aCtion betwixt the parts of the fame plant, or by the approximation of male and female plants. Between the formation, maturity, and impregnation of the feed of plants, and thofe of the ova of animals, there is a clofe analogy. The feed is formed and ma- tured while attached to the parent plant; but the veflels of the plant having completed this operation, Ihrink from their connections with the feed, leaving it with its little fyftem of veflels complete, and with a kind of imperfeCt life, which may be confidered as analogous to a dormant (late. This imperfeCt life, or perhaps

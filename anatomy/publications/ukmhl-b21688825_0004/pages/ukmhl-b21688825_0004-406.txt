APPENDIX. 36* pofterior tibia! vein ; for it is a mere net-work of veins furrounding the pofterior tibial artery. It receives-, near its termination, a branch called Suralis, front the gaftrocnemii and foleus: it terminates in the pop- liteal vein. The Ven,® Percne.e are the vena; comites by the tibial artery, and are two or three in number. All thefe veins have free inofculations with each other. The Popliteal vein.—This vein is formed by the three divifions of deep veins accompanying the arteries of the leg, and the faphena minor. It lies more fuperficial than the artery, and feems to cling round it. As it afcends, however, it twifts round the artery, the artery being neared the bone—a little above the joint it receives the lelfer faphena. This vein, perforating the tendon of the triceps, comes to the fore part of the thigh, ftill united to the artery : it is now the crural vein. As it afcends it gets from behind the artery, fo that in the groin it lies nearer the pubes than the artery does: oppofite the trochanter minor it receives the internal and external circumflex veins, and the Profunda Femoris. About an inch below Powpart’s ligament the crural vein re- ceives the faphena major, and the fmall external pudic veins. External iliac vein.—The femoral vein lying on the infide of the artery or nearer the pubis, enters the abdomen under the femoral ligament, and pafling by the fide of the Pfoas mufcle becomes the external iliac vein. It receives feveral lelfer veins juft within the ligament particularly the epigallric vein from the mufcles and integuments of the belly, and the veins accompanying 8 the

OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. S9 GREAT DIVISIONS OF THE COLON. The great divifions of the colon ('which I conceive it necefiary to enumerate, chiefly with a view to the accurate defcription of the feat of difeafe) are thefe: Firft, the right division of the colon rifes from the infertion of the ileon, and from that part of the great intefline which is tied down by the peritoneum and cellular membrane, and afcends on the right fide of the fmall inteftines, until it gets under the margin of the liver, and in contadl with the gall-bladder. Of courfe, this part will be found to take fome confi- derable varieties in its form, depending upon its {fate of diftention. THE TRANSVERSE COLON*. The tranfverfe colon is that part of the great intef- tine which often takes a courfe diredtly acrofs the belly, but which generally forms an arch before or immedi- ately under the ftomach. When this parr of the colon however is much diftended, being at the fame time held down by the rnefocoion,. its angular turns reach under rhe umbilicus, nay even to the pelvis.

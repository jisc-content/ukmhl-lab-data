«94 OF THE lymphatic system. lymphatic veflel has three or four pairs of valves. But this bears no certain proportion ; for as thefe veffels run where they are expofed to occafional compreflion from the furrounding parts, or bear the weight of a high column of fluid, their valves are more frequent. The- lymphatics are improperly called cylindrical tubes, fmce they are irregular from their valves branching and frequent communications. The coats of the lymphatic veflels are the ftrongelt of any in the body ; for al- though extremely thin and pellucid, they give refift- ance to diftention beyond a certain point, and bear a column of mercury which would burrt through the valves of veins, and tear the coats of arteries. If there be a mufcular coat, and no one ever denied the mufcularity of the lymphatics, then we may reckon three coats: Firlt, The inner coat,which is the conti- nuation of the inner tunic of the veins, as may be obferved in the opening of the thoracic du£t into the left fubclavian and left jugular veins.. It is fmooth and polifhed, forms duplicatures or valves, and pre- vents the tranfudation of their fluids: it is connected by cellular membrane to the middle coat. Secondly, The mufcular or middle coat, which confifls chiefly of mufcular fibres, which, according to Sheldon, run in every poflible direction, though the greater number take the circular dire&ion. And,la(lly, the outer coat, which is conne&ed with the general invefting cellular membrane. As the inner coat rnufl chiefly form the valves, and as the valves poflefs fo wonderful a power of refilling the column of mercury, I fhould hold that the inner coat is that, on which the ftrength and refift- ance

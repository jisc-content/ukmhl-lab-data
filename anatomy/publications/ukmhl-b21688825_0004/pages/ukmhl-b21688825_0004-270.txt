228 OF THE VAGINA, ETC. or difcharge from the vagina, having a remarkable effeCt in relaxing the parts. This, from the nature of the parts, mull be an in- creafing difeafe ; for no looner has the womb fallen down into the vagina, than it becomes a fource of irritation, excites a bearing-down pain-like tenef- mus, an uneafy fenfation, a defire to make urine, and an obftruCtion of urine ; all which is explained by the connection of the parts.

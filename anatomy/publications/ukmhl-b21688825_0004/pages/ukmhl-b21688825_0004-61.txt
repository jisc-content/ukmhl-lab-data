OF THE PERITONEUM. 29 dead body ; for before the opening of the peritoneum, or the death of the animal, it is not in a date of va- pour, but is condenfed into a watery exudation *. I have feen, in the high ftate of inflammation of this -membrane, pus formed upon the furface without ul- ceration, and therefore, probably, from the fame -exhaling or fecreting furface; and coagulable lymph lying in flakes upon it. The increafe of the ferous difcharge forms the common afcites; but whenever the natural fecretion or exudation from the peritoneum is altered, adhefions are apt to form. One great ufe of the peritoneum is to retain the vifcera in their place, fays Haller; for when it is wounded they efcape, and fometimes with a fudden impetus, which makes it difficult to reduce or retain them f. But this is not from the want of the em- bracing of the peritoneum, but from the tendons or mufcles which fupport the peritoneum being cut; for when there is a deficiency in the fupport given by the abdominal mufcles, or their expanded tendons, the peritoneum does not prevent the vifcera from being protruded, but eafily yields to their forcible protrufion, and forms a fac involving this hernia. Nor do the procefles of the peritoneum, which have received the name of ligaments, nor the mefentery, nor mefocolon, fufficiently refifl: the prolapfus of the vifcera when they have efcaped from the preflure of the fur* * This vapour I have feen ai'iling from the inteftines of the human body during the operation for hernia; and alfo when the omentum and inteftines have efcaped in confequence of a wound of the belly. f Element.

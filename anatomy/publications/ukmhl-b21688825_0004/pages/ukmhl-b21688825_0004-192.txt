l6o OF THE BLADtDER OF URINE. in the bladder, and when it is owing to an increafe in thicknefs, and a rigidity of the coats of the bladder $ Jor, in the latter cafe, the operation of the gorget is at- tended with very ferious evils. We have an idea of the wonderful degree of con- traction in the bladder, and indeed the extent of mo- tion in the mufcular fibre in general, when we confider that the bladder extends fo as to contain two pounds of urine, and contracts fo as to force out the lad drop from its cavity. When, however, the fibres are ftretched too far, they lofe the power of contraction, and often the young furgeon is deceived by what he conceives to be an incontinence of urine while it is really an obftruCtion. VASCULAR COAT, OR CELLULAR COAT. When I call this third coat of the bladder the vaf- cular coat, it is merely from its analogy to that coat of the intedines which I have diftinguifhed by the name of vafcular. Anatomifts have called it the nervous and cellular coat; the fird of which is quite improper and the lad apt to be confounded with the furrounding cellular outer coat. This coat (if coat it may be cal- led) confilts of very extenfile white lamella: of Cellular membrane. It gives didribution to a few veffels, and conneCls the mufcular fibres and inner coat. The Internal coat of the bladder is very finooth on its general furface, and is bedewed with a fheathing mucus. When the bladder is didended, no inequali- ties are to be obferved; but when contracted it falls into folds and rugae. From an acrid date of the urine; from

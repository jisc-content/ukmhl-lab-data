INTRODUCTION-. Difappointed in obtaining an unexceptionable general theory of fecretion, we are only enabled to conclude, that while a power exifts in an animal body, direfting its aftions, perhaps both in the folids and fluids, and particularly in the mutual influence which they exert, the form, length, and activity of the veflels and dufts give occafion to the greater or lefs degree of intricacy in the operation of the principles upon which the fe- cretion depends. Let us then attend to the obfervations of the drift anatomifls, and to the appearance which the glan- dular viscera prefent under the knife. It is not perfeftly clear what the older anatomifls- meant by the expreflion Parenchyma* It would appear however to have faved them the trouble of inveftigation, and all abftrufe fpeculation. They meant flelh, yet not mufcular fubftance, but fuch as the liver prefents. This matter they feetn to have conceived to be formed by the blood. Thus Higmore defcribes the liver to be formed of the blood of the umbilical vein : the opinion originally of Erafiftratus. Previous to the time of Malpighi it is fruitlefs to trace the opinions of anatomifls regarding the ftruc- ture of glands. He was the firft who fopght to throw light upon this obfcure fubjeft by anatomical inveftiga- tion, and he made a more rapid progrefs than has been done by any man fince his day. If we take into con- ftderation the difficulties he had to encounter in a new field, and the prejudices of the learned with which he had to combat, his merits will be found greater than pven thofe of Ruyfch. The opinions of Malpighi were Received by thofe who, forfaking the authorities of names.

5S OF THE STOMACH. the inner or villous coat. The effeft of all thefe coats, reflefted inward at the lower orifice, is to form a tumid and pretty thick ring, which appears like a per- forated circular membrane when the ftomach has been inflated and dried ; but in neither ftate is its direftion oblique fo as to aft as a valve. It feems capable of refilling the egrefs of the food from the ftomach, or the return of the matter from the duode- num, merely by the aftion of the circular fibres which are included in it. On the furface of the inner coat of the ftomach, fmall retiform rugae and a pile of innumerable villi are obferved. But thisftrufture of the ftomach has not been fo fully examined, and is not fo perfeftly underftood as the analogous appearance in the inteflines. Glands are alfo defcribed as opening upon the inner furface of the ftomach : and thofe who have not been at>Ie to fee thefe glands, which are feated in the third cellular coat, yet believe in their exiftence from analogy ; while others obferve foramina toward the upper and lower orifice of the ftomach, which they fuppofe to be the opening or dufts of glands. Thefe, however, which I believe to be merely cryptae or follicles, are themfelves the fecreting furface, and not the dufts of the proper round glandular bodies ; at the fame time it mull be admitted that difeafe, as if magnifying and giving fize to the ftrufture of the ftomach, fliews a glandular and tuberculated ftrufture.

OF THE TESTES. 382 From this fourth plan of the tefticle, we may learn the nature of the congenital hernia. It is a hernia produced by the inteftine flipping down, from the communication betwixt the general cavity of the peri- toneum, and the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, or in confequence of an adhefion betwixt the tefticle and a portion of the gut, which of courfe caufes the gut to follow the teflicle, and prevents the communication betwixt the belly and the cavity of the tunica vaginalis from being fhut. Thus, fig. 4. A, is the tefticle, aS it is feen in plan 3d. B, the tunica albuginea ; C, the peritoneum within the belly ; D, the tunica vagi- nalis, which we can trace from C, and which is dif- tended and feparated from the furface of the tefticle, (/. c. of the albuginea) by a portion of the gut, which has defcended through the ring: F, the inteftines within the belly : G, the inteftine which has fallen into the tunica vaginalis, and is in contact with the tefticle; that is, in contact with the tunica vaginalis, which is in clofe union with the gland, and is confidered as its furface. We have explained the change which takes place in the fituation of the tefticle, as it relates to the peri- toneum ; but how this change is brought about, if is very difficult to underftand. It is not a fudden pulling down of the tefticle, but a very gradual procefs, con- tinuing for months; it is not the efte<T: of gravitation, for the foetus may be in every variety of pofture while in the womb, and generally the head prefents. It is not refpiration. Is it then the efteft of the a&ion of the cremafter mufde ? or muft we refer it to a law fuch as that

The nerves of the tefticle, lFke the blood-veffelS, come from the loins, and are continued down upon die veflels in the fpermatic plexus. This hill farther allies the tefticle to the abdominal vifcera, giving them much of the fame fympathies. The ftomach, intef- tines, and tefticle, fympathife readily with each othen As we find the tunica albuginea of the tefticle to be very firm, denfe, and unelaftic, the great pain in in- flammation of the tefticle has naturally been attributed to the refiftance made by this coat to the fwelling of the fubftance of the tefticle, but much muft be afcribed to the natural fenfibility of the part, independently of fwelling and tenfion; for in the very moment of a blow, a perfon faints and falls down from exquifite pain. - The lymphatics of the tefticle are numerous, and eafily demonftrated by blowing up the cellular ftruc- ture of the body of the tefticle; and we fhall by-and- by find, that this has been the ground of difpute be- tween phyfiologifts; and the proofs of feme import- ant points in the dodlrine of abforption have been drawn from the injection. of the lymphatics of the tefticle and cord. * Corpus varicofum,—Corpus Pampiniform e; Galen de Se- xjiine.

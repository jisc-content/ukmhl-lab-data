A 2 The APPENDIX. 35s Told Veins carry back the blood from the mufcles or the fore-part of the throat, from the larynx, from the fub- ftance of the thyroid gland, and from the neighbour- ing part of the trachea and: pharynx, and even from the fauces. Sometimes thefe thyroid veins enuer the ex- ternal jugular vein ; fometimes they defcend upon the neck, taking the name of guttural veins; they unite themfelves with the interna! jugular vein. The lower thyroid veins.—'Come from the lower part of the thyroid gland, and defcend upon the fore-part of the trachea, and enter the fubclavean; or, more generally, the great, or internal jugular veins. Of the internal jugular vein.-—The inter- nal jugular vein is formed by the conflux of the feveral great and pofterior fmufes of the dura mater into the lateral Anus, which coming out by the foramen laceruni poflerius of the bafis cranii, ceafes to be conflrifted into the triangular fhape, and takes the form and pecu- liarities of a vein. From this foramen, common to the temporal and occipital bone, the jugular vein defcenas obliquely forward and downward, becoming from its deep fituauon fomewhat more fuperficial, but in all its extent protefted by the fterno-cleido-maftoideus mufcle ; and it paflfes under the omo^hyoideus mufcle. The internal jugular vein is very irregular in its form ; being fometimes much contrafted under the angle of the jaw ; bulging and much enlarged, or rather capa- ble of being much diftended in the middle of the neck; and again contrafted before it joins the fubclaveans. The carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the par vagum lie together in the fame flneath of loofe cel- lular membrane.

3^4 0F THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. On the fide of the face, there are in general feveral fmall lymphatic glands on the buccinator rnufcle im- merfed in the furface of the parotid gland, under the zigomatic procefs. There are alfo glands to be care- fully noted, which lie under the tip of the parotid gland, where it extends behind the angle of the jaw, and alfo lying under the bafe of the jaw-bone, clofe to the fub-maxillary gland, and on the couife of the facial artery. The glands and absorbents of the neck are very numerous, and the latter form an intricate and beautiful plexus, feveral branches of which are to be obferved accompanying the external and internal jugular veins. Some of the glands lie immediately under the {kin, and in the cellular membrane, on the outer edge of the platifma myoides; many under that rnufcle, and in the courfe of the externa! jugular vein. But there are many feated deep, for the greater number accompany the internal carotid artery, and internal jugular vein or their branches. The lymphatics of the thyroid gland have been raifed by Mr. Cruickfhanks, by plunging a lancet at random into the fubftance of the gland, and blowing into it, or throwing quickfilver into its cellular membrane. The trunks of thefe lymphatics join the thoracic duÂ£t on the left fide; and on the right fide the right trunk, juft as it is about to enter into the veins. OF THE TRUNKS OF THE ABSORBENT SYSTEM. The larger and proper trunk of the lymphatic fyf- tem, is generally called the thoracic duct, becaufe n

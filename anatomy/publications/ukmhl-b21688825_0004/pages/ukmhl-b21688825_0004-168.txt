OF THE SPLEEN-. *56 been deduced. We may conclude that it is not the means of retarding the blood in its circulation, but of giving force to it. The fplenic artery does not only ramify in the fpleen, but it fupplies all the left part of the ftomach, and that great facculated extremity in particular which receives the food, and in which the procefs of digeflion is chiefly performed. My idea is, that when the ftomach is empty, when there is no food in it to folicit the difcharge of the gaftric fluid, the blood circulates in a moderate degree in the coats of the ftomach, and the fpleen receives the furcharge of blood ; but when a full meal is taken into the ftomach, when the adlion of the gaftric juice is required in great quantity, the adtion of the fplenic artery is folicited to the vaia brevia and left gaftro-epiploic artery, and thus a fucJden flow of the gaftric fluid is beftowed by the in- creafed activity of the fplenic artery. When again the contents of the ftomach are fully faturated with the fluids from its coats, there is no longer an excited adlion of the fplenic veflels, and the artery terminating in the veins, the fpleen returns the blood to the liver. While the veflels of the ftomach partake largely of the lupply of blood, the arteries to the pancreas alfo re- ceive fome increafe of activity ; and even the blood of the vena portae requires an additional activity. We have feen that the ftomach and inteftines, the liver, pancreas, and fpleen are combined in fundtion, connedted by the fame fyftem of veflels, mutually fub- fervient to each other, and tending to the fame end, the reception, digeflion, and firft ftage of the aflimila- tion of nutritious matter to the fyftem. We leave this fubject therefore until we can take up that of abforp- tion

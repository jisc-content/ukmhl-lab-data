OF THE WOMB, Dr. Hunter fuppofed, that the ovum paffed into the cavity of the uterus whilfl the coagulable lymph was pouring out by the arteries of the uterus, and that it was thus immerfed in, and furrounded by the decidua, for he could not conceive that it could gain admif- fion betwixt the lamina of the membrane already formed. I fhonld conceive that the ovum A, upon its de- fcent gets intangled behind the deciduous membrane B, by which means the ovum is not left loofe :n the cavity of the womb, but is foon attached and fur- rounded with a membrane, or vafcular web, from which it can immediately draw fupplies, and by this provifion alfo its adhefion to the fuperior part of the uterus is infured. But as the fam| action of the ute- rus continues, and, as we mull naturally fuppofe, be rather occafioned by the prefence of the ovum in its cavity, the furface cf the uterus at A continues to throw out a coagulable matter which furrounds that part of the ovum, fo that this will immediately become its fituation.

8 £ OF THE SMALL INTESTINES* Food, and as we know that an unufual excitement Is very apt to caufe an inverted action, it often happens that the intus-fulception is formed by the lower portion of the gut included in the upper part* VASCULAR COAT. This third coat of the inte{lines,or what is commonly called the nervous coat, is a ftratum of cellular mem- brane in which the veflels of the gut are diflributed. It might with equal propriety be called the cellular coat; and is indeed what fome anatomifts have called the third cellular coat. By inverting the gut and blowing ftrongly into it, the peritoneal coat cracks and allows the air to efcape into this coat; which then fwelis out> demonitrating its ftrutlure to be completely cellular *. Its ufe evidently is to fuffer the arteries, veins, and lymphatics to be diftributed to luch a degree of minute- nefs as to prepare them for reflection into the laft and innerinoft coat, and for entering into the ftrudture of the villi: for they come to the extremity of the meflfen- tery as confiderable branches, but forming in this coat a uniform texture of veflels, their extreme branches are finally diftributed to the inner coat. This is the coat in which, in fome parts of the inteftines, little glands or criptae are lodged* • An experiment, to which. Albiuus attaches much impor- tance.

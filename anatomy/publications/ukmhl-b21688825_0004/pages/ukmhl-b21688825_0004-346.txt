304 ORIGIN OF THE LYMPHATICS, lymphatic gland into which it enters, receiving the venereal matter, inflames and fuppurates, &c. But again, I choofe to fay, with every (how of likelihood, that neither is this a proof of abforption ; but that the lymphatic velTel being very irritable, and always receiv- ing its ftimulus to action from its extremities, it has partaken of the venereal inflammation ; that this in- flammation has been propagated to the gland; that, the gland being formed of the convoluted lymphatic veflels, the effedt of this inflammatory adtion is then accumulated to fo great a degree as to deftroy the fundtion of the gland and lead to fuppuration *. And further, that the difeafe is received into the conftitution only in confequence of the fyftem at large partaking of the irritation (a word which but imperfectly expreffes the change) of the local adtion of veflels. Matter might be abforbed and taken into the conftitution, and the difeafe propagated according to the common explana- tion j but, according to that offered here, there mud be a primary and local difeafe, from which the general affedtion is propagated. If we are to take the inflam- mation and hardening of the lymphatics and axillary- glands as a fymptom of abforption from a difeafed mamma, we muft acknowledge the fame proof in evidence of the veins abforbing : for although the lymphatics are more adtive, and their adtivity depends on the ftate of their origins and extreme branches, * If a chancre be indolent, although master be formed in it, no bubo will be produced : but if the furgeon applies fome cor- rofive drefling, which, inftead of entirely deftroying the difeafed fpot, inflames it; then will the gland in the groin fympathize and rife into a bubo. more

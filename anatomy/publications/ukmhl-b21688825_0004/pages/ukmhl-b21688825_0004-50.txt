INTRODUCTION-. 20 The opinions of Malpighi and Ruyfch have heM the fchools in perpetual controverfy ; mod anafomids however leaning to the authority of Ruyfch. There follows thefe a crowd of French academicians, who, With Boerhaave, may be confidered as mere commenta- tors on the original authorities of Malpighi and Ruyfch. Some of thefe argue for feeretion by con- tinuous veffels, and contend that the arteries terminate in the excretory duds; others, that the fecretions are made into folicules; and fome, as Boerhaave, infill that both are right in their obfervations, and in the proofs which they have adduced, that feeretion is in part performed by continuous veffels, partly by a more intricate glandular apparatus. As the forms of the parts which throw out fecre- tions have an infinite variety, it may be ufeful in this introductory view to point out thefe va- rieties-, and their appropriate names *. In the fird place, although in general language the term gland implies a fecreting body, yet this does not follow from the definition of that word. According to Hippocrates* it is a tutpid round body, foft, fmootb, and filming. Many fuch bodies, and which we call glands, have Ho excretory duds, and do not fecrete a fluid ; while, mod fecreting parts admit of no fuch definition* When, again, we admit the definition of authors who have taught their peculiar opinions regarding their ftrudure* we have a dill Iefs admiflible defeription. * The terms- acini, cotulte, crypts, foliculi, glanduls, la- yeunas, loculi, utriculi, have been alrnoft promifcuoufly ufed; feeing fo many names for bundles, bags, bottles, holes* and partitions. 6 Thus

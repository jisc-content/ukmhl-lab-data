OF THE TEETH. 371 circulating through the body of the tooth, and that it undergoes the fame changes by abforption which the other bones are proved to do; but thefe experiments may have been made while the teeth were forming by the depofition from the pulp, and of courfe they might be coloured without the experiment affording a fair proof that the circulation continues in the tooth after it is formed. If it be proved that the adult teeth, or a fully formed tooth yet within the jaw, are uniformly tinged with the madder, we mull without referve con- clude, that the economy of the teeth .is in all refpe&s like that of the common bones. The teeth undergo changes of colour in the living body, to which it would appear they could not be liable as dead matter. They become yellow, tranf- parent, and brittle with old agej and when a tooth has been knocked from its focket, and replaced, dentifls have obferved that it lofes its whitenefs, and affumes a darker hue. The abforption of the roots in confequence of the caries of the body of the tooth, and the abforption of the fangs of the deciduous teeth, are further alleged in proof of their vafcularity j not only the preffure of the rifing tooth on the fangs of the temporary teeth will caufe an abforption of the latter, but the fangs of the temporary teeth will wafte and be abforbed, fo as to drop out without the mechanical preffure of the per- manent teeth, and before they have advanced to be in contatt with the former. The teeth feem acutely fenfible, but a little confidera- tion teaches us that the hard fubftance of the teeth is not endowed with fenfibility, and that it muff be the B b 4 remains

OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 333 gentleman examined the villi of a patient who died fuddenly after a meal, he obferved fome of them to be turgied with chyle, fo that nothing of the ramifications of the arteries or veinj were to be obferved ; the whole appeared as one white vefTel without any red lines, pores, or orifices ; others of the villi contained chyle in a lefs proportion ; and here the ramifications of the veins were numerous, and prevailed by their rednefs over the whitenefs of the villi. In fome hundred villi he faw the trunk of a ladteal forming by radiated branches, one branch in each villus. Mr. Cruickfhank and Dr. Hunter counted fifteen or twenty orifices in fome of the villi. Mr. Cruickfhank has remarked a deep and a fuperficial fet of la&eals on the inteftines $ but for this divifion there feems no neceflity. Deep in the coats the la&eals feem to accompany the blood veffels; but when they get more fuperficial, they take a courfe longitudinally on the canal, and turn devioufly, or after running a little way, take a hidden turn towards the mefentery. As the greater frequency of the valvulae conni- ventes in the jejunum, greatly encreafe the extent of its inner furface of the gut, and confequently give a greater extent of origin to the ladteals; and, as here the chyle mufl be in the greater quantity, fo the la&eals of this portion of the gut are larger and more nu- merous than in any other part of the extent of the canal. The ladleals do not attach themfelves to the veffels of the mefentery, but take a courfe individually, or forming plexus. Before they enter the mefenteric glands, they have been called lacteals of the firft order; You IV. Z when

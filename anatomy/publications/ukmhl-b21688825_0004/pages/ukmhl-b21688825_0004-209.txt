OF THE TESTES. 177 it as from the peritoneum within the belly, the outer furface of- the tunica albuginea is alfo finooth and firm, and white, whence its name. But on its inner furface, like the peritoneum, which covers the in- teftine, and adheres to the mufcular coat, it adheres to the tubes of the tefticle itfelf. Thefe inverting coats are in fome refpedts diffimilar, yet in general much alike, being continuations of the fame mem- brane, and both prolongations of the peritoneum. The outer membrane, the tunica vaginalis, is a pro- tection to the tefticle, gliding eafily on the inner coat, and with the mobility of the cellular membrane of the dartos it preferves the terticles from bruifes and ftrokes to which it would be expofed if it were more firmly attached. The inner tunic, or albuginea, gives rtrength and firmnefs to the fubftance of the tefticle. Betwixt thefe coats is the fluid collected, which forms the hydrocele. They alfo contain the congenital her- nia $ but the common hernia is without both coats of the tefticle. To underftand the principles of anatomy of this part, we muft attend to the defcent of the tefti- cle, and to the manner in which thefe coats are formed. OF THE DESCENT OF THE TESTICLE. In the foetus, fome months before birth, the teftr- cles are lodged in the belly, and are in every refpeCt like the abdominal vifcera. They are feated on the fore part of the pfoae mufcles, by the fide of the rec- tum. They are of courfe covered and inverted by the peritoneum -t for, as we have explained how the Vol. IV. N folid

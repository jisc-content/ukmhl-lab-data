THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF GENERATION. 209 brane. There is of courfe a great variety in its fize. In early life it is fmall: it becomes, as we have faid, more prominent at the age of puberty ; in fat women it is of an enormous fize; and in fome warm climates a particular laxity prevails. From the hair on this part, marking the age of puberty, it is called pubis. As the lax texture admits of diftenfion with the fluid of anafarca, it is fometimes from this caufe very great- ly fwelled. The labile. Thefe are often named aim, from a flight refemblance to wings, and they are alfo called externm, magnse, or majores, from their place, and from their fuperiority in refpedt of fize over the nymphse. The labiae feeni to be the mons veneris continued downward, and laterally until meeting be- low, they form the vulva; at their lower angle, by their union, they form the fourchette, or frenum la- biorum. The ftrudture of the labiae is flmilar to that of the mons veneris; fometimes one is larger than the other. The great fenflbility of the membrane which lines the infide of the labiae, requires fome defence, and therefore the whole furface is amply fupplied with mucous folicules and glands. The labim are a protec- tion to the other foft parts, fo neceffary, that the cli- toris, or nymphae, when they projedt beyond them, are fubjedt to violent inflammation. The parts here have either fuch folds, or are of fo lax a texture, as to permit a great degree of diften- tion during the paflage of the child. But, as the labise have no mufcular power, and depend entirely on their eTadicity for reftoring them to their original fize, they commonly, after being very much dilated, remain P 3 in

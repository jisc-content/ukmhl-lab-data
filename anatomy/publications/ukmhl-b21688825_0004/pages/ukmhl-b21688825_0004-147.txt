OF THE LIVF&. Its cOurfe when influenced by diforder of the vifcera, are the fource of the raoft fevere and diftrefling fymptoms *. In the dead body we fee the colon and duodenum, or whatever parts lie in contadf with the gall bladder, flained with bile; but this evidence of tranfudation which is found in the dead body, is not feen in the living; while the ffain from the bile is obferved to be deeper and more eXtenfive in bodies long dead. It is therefore another example of the peculiar properties inherent in the living fibres, that no tranfudation is allowed ; but that the fluids, which appear as if exuding from the living furfaces, are difcharges from organic porÂ§s, or from the extremities of veffels. OF MINUTE Sf RU CTtJRE OF THE LIVER. The liver is firmer and dryer in feme degree that! ainy of the other vifcera ; the intertexture of membrane is weak, and in confequence the fubffance of the liver is friable and eafily torn. When cut or torn, it feems for the greater part vafcular ; or it difplays the mouths of innumerable dudls and veffels, and, after a minute injection, the blood-veffels feem to pervade every par- ticle, even when examined with the microfcope. This texture of veffels, in which we may fay the fubffance of the liver chiefly confiffs, is furrounded * We have one example of this In a late Treatife on the Dil- eafes of the Bowels of Children, by Dr. Cheyne: an efihy mod particularly uleful in its obj-edt; and the reafoning of which is founded on anatomical observation, fupported by facts, and deductions from practice.

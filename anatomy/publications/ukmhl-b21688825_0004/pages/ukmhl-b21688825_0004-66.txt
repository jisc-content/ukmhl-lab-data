!®P THE rERlTofttUfif. 54 is fuppofed to confift of four lamina of membranes of extreme tenuity : but thefe four layers cannot be de- monftrated. The great omentum extends from the Bofom of the fpleen tranfverfely, until it terminates on the right fide of the arch of the colon, where the omentum colicum begins. The great omentum varies confiderably in extent. In a child it is Ihort; in the adult further extended over the vifcera: fometimes it reaches only to the umbilicus ; fometimes it is allowed to extend its margin into the pelvis, fo that in old people it is very apt to form a part of the contents of hernia : often it is wafted and fhrunk ; fometimes colle&ed into maffes leaving the furface of the inteftines. OF THE OMENTUM MINUS OR HEPATICO GAS- TRICUM. This is a membrane of the nature of that laft men- tioned, but in general lefs loaded with fat. It is ex- tended from the liver to the lefler arch of the ftomach. It palfes off from the lower furface of the liver at the tranfverfe folia; from the folia ductus venofi; invefts the lobulus fpigellii; involves the branches of the caeliac artery ; and is extended to the lefler curvature of the ftomach and the upper part of the duodenum *. * “ Maeilentius eft,etvafa habet minora.” Winflow.

There is no reafon to believe that the umbilical vein carries back the blood with greater force than any other returning vein: on the contrary, from its flze and the length of its courfe it is natural to fuppofe the motion of the blood in it to be very flow and equable. We mud look upon the peculiarities in the circula- tion of the blood in the liver of the fcetus as a provifion againft the fecretion of ftimulating bile ; for when the 'child is born and the circulation altered, bile is formed more abundantly, and becomes the flimulus to the whole abdominal vifcera, roufmg them to new action. As to the comparifon which Haller has made between the ftate of the liver and that of the lungs, it is evident that the latter, though fmail in bulk, are fully formed, and want only inflation to complete their funftion. On the contrary, in the liver of the foetus the veflels are neceflarily diftended with blood, to give them the fize requiflte for this future function; but that blood, cither from its qualities or from the eafy and diredt paflage it has into the heart, does not fecrete the bile in quantity and quality fo as to flimulate the dufts and rnteftines, as in the adult circulation. If it did, we fhould not fee the alimentary canal of the fcetus loaded with matter, and yet not ftimulated to aftion, but in a flate of inactivity and torpor.

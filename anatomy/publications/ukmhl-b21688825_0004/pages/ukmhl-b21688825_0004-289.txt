247 OF THE WOMB. from ftagnant blood being found in the uterine veins of women dying during the flow of the menfes, and orifices being obferved larger than could well be fup- pofed to be the extremities of arteries. I would fay, that it is little probable that fpontane- ous htemorrhagy proceeds from the rupture of the extreme arteries, becaufe it is the activity of the ar- teries which caufes the haemorrhagy ; and becaufe this activity is the exertion of a mufcular force, and the exertion of a mufcular fibre never is fuch as to tear the fibre itfelf. On the other hand, we obferve that it is the necefiary confequence of an increafe of the adion of arteries, that the correfponding veins dilate, and feem to fuffer a force of diftenfion proportioned to their increafed activity. We mull not forget that many are of opinion, that the menftrual blood flows from the exhaling arteries. This opinion muff reft upon argument, and not fads, unlefs the affertion of Raauw be taken as proof, that he could diftin- guifh their mouths; or that of Mebomius, who faid he introduced bridles into them. That anatomifts have introduced bridles into pores, or foramina, it would be ungracious to doubt, but that thefe were the orifices of exhaling arteries, is difficult to believe. I rather imagine, that there is a provifion for this eva- cuation in pores, or foramina, in the extreme veins on the vafcular inner furface of the womb. From the confideration of the caufe of menftruation, as I have conceived it, from the fymptoms which proceed and accompany it, and from the effed attri- butable to the menftrual adion on the uterine fyftem, we cannot confider it as a mere evacuation of blood, but

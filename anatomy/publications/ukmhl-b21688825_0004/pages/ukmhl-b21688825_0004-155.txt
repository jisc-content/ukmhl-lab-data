123 OF THE LIVER. Finally, as to the ufe of the liver independently of the fecretion of the bile, we mull lay afide the opinions mentioned by Haller that it fupports the diaphragm, protrudes it up in expiration, and receives the contrac- tion of it equally in infpiration, fo as uniformly to com- prefs the other abdominal vifcera; or that it foments and cherilhes the flomach by the heat of its blood. Thefe are at lead as bad as the theories of the ancients mentioned in the beginning of this feftion. Hallerâ€™s failing is the promifcuous admittance of all faffs and every kind of theory, with a timoroufnefs and indeci- fion in giving his own opinion. There is another remark of Haller which deferves attention. When I refleff, fays he, that there is no bile required in the foetus, there being no food receiv- ed : when again I fee that the liver is of great fize in the fetus, and not fmaH like the lungs, which are deffined to an operation in the oeconomy after birth, I cannot but fufpeff that it has fome other ufe in the fetus than the fecretion of the bile. If the umbilical vein had opened direffly into the cava, he thinks it would have returned, with too great an impetus upon the heart, and would by its preponderancy have retarded the return of the blood from the lower extremities. He thinks that the liver is ufeful in breaking and weakening the impulfe ol the blood from the umbilical vein; that it is a guard to the right auricle, which would be other- ways endangered by the rapid flow of the blood. Now furely the liver is much lefs able to Hand the impulfe of the blood than the heart; and yet there is no provi- fion for the breaking of the force of the blood in the liver. Further, there is a direft duel of com- munication

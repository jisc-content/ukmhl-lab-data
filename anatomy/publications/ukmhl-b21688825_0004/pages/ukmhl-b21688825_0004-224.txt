OF THE TESTES. 192 improvements of anatomy by the Hunters and Monro i but I mufl fay, that the ftruCture of the tefticle was demonftrated by De Graaff to his fellow anatomifts of Montpelier, and his difcoveries publifhea in a manner fo perfeCt, as to leave us little to learn from more mo- dern authors. De Graaff, by exciting animals to venery, and tying the fpermatic cord, had the feminal vefiels diflended. He did not depend upon injections; by maceration and diffeCtion in this diflended flate, he unravelled all' the intricacies of their tubes. More modern anato- mifts have proved the truth of his obfervations by in- jections of mercury, and have fucceeded in a variety of ways of preparing the tefticle. Tueuli testis.â€”When the tunica albuginea teftis is lifted, the body of the tefticle is found to confift of innumerable very delicate white tubes; which, when difentangled from the minute cellular membrane which conneCts them, and floated in water, exhibit a mofl aftonifhing extent of convoluted veflels. By a elofer attention, however, to this ftruCture before it is thrown into confufxon by pulling out,the tubes, they appear to' be regularly laid in partitions of the cellular membrane. Thefe fepimenta are very regular in fome animals, and While they feparate the feminal tubes, they fupport and convey the blood-veflels to the fecretion of the femen. Dr. Monro has denied the formal divifions which De Graaff had engraved, but acknowledges them lefs regular, lefs ealily found, and not fo limited in their number; nor does he find them to prevent all communication betwixt the tubes of the tefticle* Thefe

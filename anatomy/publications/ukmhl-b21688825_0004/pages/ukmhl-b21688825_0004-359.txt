OF THE COURSE 05 THE LYMPHATICS. 317 two fets of lymphatics : fuperficial ones, which take a courfe to the groin ; and deeper ones, which take a courfe along the arteries of the penis into the pelvis, or under the arch of the pubis. - The fuperficial lympha- tics are the cutaneous veflels, and take their origin from the prepuce, and it is thefe which, either abforb- ing the venereal matter of chancre, or fympathizing with the venereal action, form fometimes an inflamed line along the penis, and caufe the buboe in the groin. But as there are two fets of lymphatics, the chancre may be in a place where the deep-feated veflels are the abforbents, and confequently the conflitution is contaminated without any buboe in the groin ; and indeed it has been obferved, that a venereal ulcer of the prepuce will, in general, produce buboe, when an ulcer of the glands will not *. When the trad of the matter is through the deep lymphatics which enter the pelvis from below, the gland through which the veflels pafs, is not inflamed to form a buboe ; neither do the lymphatic glands within the ligament of the thigh in- flame to the extent of forming a buboe, either from chancre or from buboe in the groin. This, fays a celebrated anatomift, Mr. Cruickfhanks, is very fortu- nate ; for if the external iliac glands, like the inguinal glands, fhould fuppurate, they could not be opened by the lancet, they muff be left to themfelves; they might burft $ the pus might fall into the cavity of the abdo- men ; might produce peritoneal inflammation; and might probably deftrov the patient. Now, there ap- pears no reafon to dread any fuch cataftrophe. The matter of thefe glands would form an abcefs, which. Vol. IV. Cruickflianks, page 138. Y like

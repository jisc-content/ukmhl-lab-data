OF THE WOMB. 269 frigid, white, firm, and thick *. When we examine the outfide of an entire ovum, we obferve that at the place covering the placenta, it is corrugated and full of irregular eminences like the convolu- tions of the brain, and amongfl thofe irregularities many fmall convoluted arteries may be difcerned, with fpots of extravafation and the flat mouths of veins. Upon diffefting up this maternal part -of the placenta, we find it to form the firmed part of it; and by the difference of colour, as w'ell as by the pof- fibility of tearing it up, or diffefting from the mafs of veflels of the chorion, wâ€™e recognize it as the decidua. This union, however, betwixt the maternal and foetal parts of the placenta is intimate, and it is impoflible to determine by diffeftion with the knife, whether there be modulations betwixt the maternal and foetal vefTels, or whether the nourifhment of the foetus is by abforption, nor can we didinguifh in the fird months the cellular intertexture which may be obferved in the placenta of the full time, as defcribed by Mr. Hunter. In explanation of this part of our fubjeft, I have purpofely diffefted, and made drawings of the ovum in feveral dages. This point of anatomy relating to the decidua, is particularly explained in Plates VI. and VII. to which I refer the reader. Of the liquor amnii, as conducing to the NOURISHMENT OF THE FCETUS.

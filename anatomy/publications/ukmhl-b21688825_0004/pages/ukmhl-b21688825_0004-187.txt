OF THE MALE- PARTS OF GENERATION. s there is no very accurate divifion betwixt the vif- cera of the abdomen and thofe of the pelvis; as the vifcera of the pelvis, when diflended, rife into the belly, and are in every refpedt like the abdominal vif- cera, many have objedted to a divifion of the vifcera of the abdomen and pelvis: neverthelefs, there appears to be good reafon for this divifion of the fubjedt. The function of the parts is different; the manner of their connection is different; their difeafes have widely dif- rent effedts. We have feen that the pelvis confifts of the facrum and offa innominata, and that anatomifts have diflin- guifhed the true and the falfe pelvis. The falfe pelvis is formed of the extended wings of the offa ilii, and fup- ports the vifcera of the abdomen. The true pelvis, marked by the cavity finking beneath the promontory of the facrum and the linea innominata, contains the redlum ; the urinary bladder; the proflate gland ; the veficulte feminales; and part of the urethra. The manner in which thefe parts are connedled, and the anatomy of the urinary bladder, proflate gland, and urethra, will form the fubjedl of the firfl fedtion; while the anatomy of the parts connedled with thofe of the pelvis in fundtion, but feated without, will form the fubjedl of the fecond.

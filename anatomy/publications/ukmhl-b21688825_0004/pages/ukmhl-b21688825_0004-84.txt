S1 Of THE STOMACH. the miring, only at ftated intervals after taking food ; i.e. a? the time in which the food fhould be fent into the in- teftines in the natural courfe of action. The mufcular fibres of the flomach are excited by ftimuli, applied, not to their fubflance, but to the con- tiguous coats ; and betwixt the delicate furface of the inner coat and the mufcular fibres there is the flriCteft fympathy and connection. The fame connection holds in a lefs intimate degree betwixt the cuter coat and the mufcular fibres; for when a part on the furface of the flomach of a living animal is touched with acid or ftimulating fluids, the part contracts *. The flomach is confidercd as lefs irritable than the inteflines, be- caufe it is alleged that a flronger dofe of a medicine is required to prove emetic than to aCt as a purgative : but we ought to confider that the aCtion thus excited in the inteflines is merely an acceleration of their fecre- tions; but vomiting is the interruption of the ufual ac- tion, requiring fuch a violent excitement as to invert the natural aCtion. But there is fomething more than this; as the func- tion of the flomach differs from that of the inteflines, fo may the quicknefs of their aCtion. Thus in the flomach a gradual change is to be produced upon the food, requiring time and a flow degree of motion ; but in the inteflines there is a greater agitation of their contents, and a quicker aCtion of their coats, to bring * “ In ea fede qua tangitur, contrahitur, fulcufque profundus nafcitur, etrugife; cibufque aliquando propellitur ut a fede con- tradtd fitgiat. Minus tamen quam inteftina ventriculns irrita- bilis eft : hinc emeticafortiora aecefle eft purgantibus.”— Haller.

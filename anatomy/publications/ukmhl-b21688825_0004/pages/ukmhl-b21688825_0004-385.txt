APPENDIX. 343 of the fcull ; the free communications betwixt the ex- ternal and internal jugular vein, betwixt the deep and fuperficial veins of the arm, &c. When in bleeding, the blood flows from the vein of the arm, accelerated by the woiking of the mufcles, the blood efcapes by the anaflomofis, from the compreffion of the mufcles, and fills the fuperficial veins; but the increafe of the jet of blood, is more the effect of the fwelling of the mufcles, caufing the fafcia to comprefs the veins of the fore arm. In the dead body the veins are fiat, but when dif- tended, they refume the cylindrical figure which they pofiefied in the living body: yet they are in general of the cylindrical figure, for a very little way only, ow- ing to the irregular dilatations by the fide of the valves, or by the frequent union of their branches. The manner in which the branches join the trunk, has a pe- culiarity which always dillinguifhes it from the ramifi- cations of arteries : the arteries branch off at a direct and acute angle, the veins in a direction more re- moved from the courfe of the trunk, and in general with a curve or fhoulder. In infancy and youth, the veins are little turgid, and especially the cutaneous veins, are fo firmly em- braced by the elafiic fkin and cellular membrane, that they have a lefs degree of prominency than in more advanced years. In old age, the veins are enlarged, and rife turgid on the furface, and the internal veins aifo become enlarged and varicofe. 1 do not confider this change in the vafcular fyflem, 3s the efFetl of mere diftention, or of the enlargement of the veins from the long-continued afition of the arteries; but as a ne- ceflary

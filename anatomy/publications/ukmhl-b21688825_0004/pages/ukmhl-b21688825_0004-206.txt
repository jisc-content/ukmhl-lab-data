ij4 STRUCTURE OF THE PENIS. But when furgeons fpeak of fpafms of the urethra, they f^em to forget the aftion of thefurroundingmufcles. Thus acrid and dimulating urine, or an irritable date of the urethra, will be followed by a fmall dream of urine: or perhaps a temporary obdruclion is the confequence: but why fhould we fuppofe that the membrane of the urethra, which has no appearance of mufcularity, caufes this effeft, when it is probably produced by the fphindter mufcle, the fibres which furround the membraneous part of the urethra, the levator ani, and, above all, by the accelerator urinae, a mufcular (heath of fibres furrounding three or four inches of the canal. Round the membraneous part of the urethra, and behind the bulb, there is-much inter- lacing of mufcular fibres ; and the levator ani, fplitting, embraces it. Round the finus of the urethra and the bulb which covers it, is the accelerator urinse, more properly the ejaculator feminis : and as the ejaculator feminis contradts upon the finus, it drives onward the femen along the urethra, fince the feminal fluids do not pafs backward into the bladder, unlefs when the ac- tion of the parts is much difordered ; there mud be a contraction round the urethra behind the bulb during the adlion of the ejaculator. The fenfibility of the glans holds a controul over the adlion of thefe muf- cles.; and the difeafe of the bladder and of thefe parts affedts the glans. There is, in fhort, a complicated apparatus here, and we cannot wonder, that the mod frequent feat of difeafe is jud at the beginning of the finus of the urethra,'where the mufcular a&ion is dronger, and the canal narrowed. At this place is the dridlure of the urethra mod common, and here 6 if

OF THE LIVER. 104 ca; the vena cava hepaticae; the lymphatics ; and the biliary duXs *. Thefe, with the nerves, form a very intricate fyflem of veffels, but a lefi'on of the mod par- ticular importance to the phyfician. Before fpeaking of the connexions which thefe veffels conflitute with particular parts, or with the entire fyflem, we fhall take a flriXly anatomical view of their origin and courfe. THE VENA PORTEE. This vein is divided into two parts; that which be- longs to the inteflines, and which, ramifying on the mefentry, receives the blood of the mefenteric arteries; and that part which branches in the liver, and diflri- butes there the blood which it has received from the arteries of the membranous vifcera. Even from this, divifion we fee that the vena ports has a very particu- lar diflribution; that while it is colleXing its branches from the fpleen, ftomach, and inteflines, like the veins in the other parts of the body, into a trunk, this trunk, inftead of leading direXly to the heart, or uniting with other veins in their courfe to the heart, enters the liver, and, like an artery, fpreads into minute ramifica- tions ; hence it is called the vena artCriofa. It re- fembles an artery in this alfo, that it has no valves like other veins. To be more particular; the vena ports takes its origin from the extreme branches of the coeliac, upper * And wc might add, the arteries of the outer membrane of the liver which arife from the internal mammary, phrenic, epi- gastric. and even the fpcrmatic arteries. and

242 OF THE WOMB. lieve that congeftion and plenitude is produced in the female fyftem, from the deficiency of perfpiration, from their more lax and weaker folids compared with man, from their indolent and fedentary life : for fads are in direCt contradiction. The growth and completed function of parts at this particular age, is not to be ex- plained by any theory fo partially applicable; during almoft every period of life, there are fimilar changes taking place in fome one part of the body. Parts lie dormant, and are ftationary in their growth, which at a particular and {fated age of the animal, enlarge and develope themfelves by a new and invigorated action. Obferve how different the proportions of the fetus are from thofe of the adult. We fee nature careful to perfedt certain parts, as the head and liver, at an early period. We fee during early childhood how the parts ihoot out, and evolve in due proportion. We fee parts which were large in the fetus iofe their prepon- derance : we fee others, which ferved fome purpofe in the fetal fyftem, gradually (hrink and difappear, be- caufe they have no longer the ftimulus to aCtion in the circle of connections which take place in the adult fyftem. We find other parts, as the teeth, for ex- ample, lying long within the jaw, inftead of proceed- ing with a gradual and continual enlargement, fud- denly rifing at certain ftated periods from their embryo Jftate, and enlarging and pufhing up through the gums, when it becomes, fit that the child fhould take more folid food than the motherâ€™s milk. So the fecond fet of teeth, in a more particular manner, lie quite ftationary in their growth within their little facs, yet quickly, at ftated periods, they increafe, the ena- mel

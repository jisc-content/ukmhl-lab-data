Xi INTRODUCTION; 3 kind with which it is previoufly imbued, it will not tranfmit the oil when wetted, nor will the water make any impreffion on the paper when previoufly oiled; Upon thefe fads are to be raifed a theory of fecretion ! Betwixt the fecreting veflels and the duds, in the pe-* culiar tiflue of which glandular ftrudure confifts, there is interpofed a fluid of that particular kind which is required to be fecreted, and when the blood is driven againft this tiflue fo imbued, no fluid but of a nature refembling that already depofited can be tranf- mitted. By this hypothefis they explained fecretion, making it,to depend on the attraction and repulflon of the panicles of the blood by fluids previoufly fe- creted. We may furely leave this clafs of phyfiologifts accounting for the original depofitation of the fluids in the glands without a wifh to fearch with them into the myftery of glandular fecretion. Commentators on this theory, by taking into the fyftem the adion of the nerves, indicated that they did not altogether forget that the body was alive Another fet of phyflologifls attributed the whole effed of fecretion to the velocity of the blood in the glands or fecreting veflels j-; others, to the length and curves of the veflels, and their adion upon the fluids* Again, others have been fatisfied with the round af- fertion that the vital adion was the effential caufe of fecretion. This, it ought to be underftood, rauft be univerfally acquiefced in, while yet there may remain an inquiry as to the apparent ftrudure of glands. * Conor, Tentamen epiftolare dc Secretione. f Boerhaave, Pitcarne, &e.

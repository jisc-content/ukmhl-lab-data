STRUCTURE OF THE PENIS, 173 portion of the reft of the canal. The confequence of this is, that the point of the inner membrane B makes a proje&ing ring round the urethra. To fuppofe this ftri&ure to have been formed by the mufcular con- traction in the diameter of the canal *, would be to allow the partial aCtion of one or two fibres ; (for the ftriCture is like that which would be produced by the tying of a pack-thread round the canal, being a nar- row circular ridge ;) which is very unlikely. Some- times, however, the ftriCture is only on one fide of the canal, which, allowing it to be formed as I have here fuppofed, is very likePy to happen : but in confe- quence of the mufcular aCtion, cannot eafily be fup- pofed to take place, fince the drawing of the mufcular fibres would equally affeCt the whole circle. As to the effect of beat and cold on an obftruCtion, it may be explained fimply, without the fuppofition of mufcular contraftion : for as we know that the penis, fpongy bodies, and of courfe the whole canal, relax and elongate in warmth, as they are fhrunk up and contracted in cold, like the fkin of the body in general, without implying mufcular contraction : fo we fee how this ftate would affeCt a ftriCture ;—that, when the penis and the urethra was fhrunk, the effeCt of the ftriCture would be increafed, and the patient could pafs his urine only when the parts were relaxed, by fitting in a warm room, or by the ufe of the bath, * “ A Ari&ure,” fays Mr. Home, “ whether in the fpafmo- f< die or permanent flute, is a contra&ion of the tranfverfe fibres *6 pf the membrane which fprms the cau^l.” But

APPENDIX. 35* The internal jugular vein receives thefe communi- cations and branches; behind the angle of the lower jaw, a branch of communication, generally goes down from the pofterior facial vein, and often it is joined by the internal maxillary vein : under the jaw, it either forms free communications with the beginning of the external jugular vein, or it receives the ranine and gut- tural veins; at all events, there is a branch from the fide of the throat, and the mufcles of the os hyoides which pafles into the internal jugular vein. From under the back part of the maftoideus mufcle, it receives branches from the occipital veins, and forms communications with the vertebral veins: near its termination the great jugular vein receives the guttural and lower thyroid veins. Of the vertebral veins.—There is difficulty in affigning origins to thefe veins, for they are rather like a chain of communication ; they run in the holes of the tranfverfe apoph'yfis of the cervical vertebra?, and furround the procefles with areolae. Firft a com- munication is formed with the great lateral finus, then they receive the flat finufes from under the dura mater, covering the cuniform procefs of the occipital bone, (the bafilar finufes) and as they defcend they form tranfverfe communications, which receive the branches of that chain of inofculations, which runs down upon the fpinal marrow. The vertebral veins, in their defcent, fend out divifions’which run down upon the outfide of the canal, and receive branches of veins from the mufcles on the fore part of the vertebrae, and fome of the proper cervical veins from behind.

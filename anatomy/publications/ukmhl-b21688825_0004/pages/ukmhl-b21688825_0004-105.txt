of the Small intestines. 73 The The peritoneal coat of the inteftine is continued and reflected off upon the veffels and nerves which take their courfe to the inteftine: or, what is the fame thing, and indeed is the more common defcription, the two lamina of the peritoneum which form the mefen- tery, after proceeding from the fpine and including the veffels, nerves, and glands belonging to the traCt of the inieltine, invert the cylinder of the intertine un- der the name of peritoneal coat *. The mefentery is compofed of membranes, glands, fat, and the feveral fyftems of veffels, arteries, veins, ladteals, and nerves. As in reality it is a production of the peritoneum, it may be faid to arife from the mefocolon, or the mefo- colon from the mefentery, reciprocally. But at pre- fent we may trace the mefentery from the root of the mefocolon;â€”for the jejunum, emerging from under the embrace of the mefocolon, carries forward the peri- toneum with it; and the laminse of the peritoneum, meeting behind the gut, include the veffels which pafs to it and form the mefentery. This connection of the fmall intertines by means of the prolongation of the peritoneum, while it allows a confiderable latitude of motion, preferves the convolutions in their relations, and prevents them from being twilled or involved. But it is by the walls of the abdomen that the inteftines as well as the more folid vifcera are fupported; for when the bowels efcape by a wound, a portion of an inteftine will hang down upon the thigh, unrellrained by the connexion with the mefentery. * See Plate I. 5. 6. 7. 8.

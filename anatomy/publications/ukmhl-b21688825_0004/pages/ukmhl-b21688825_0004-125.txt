OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. 93 depofits entering into the compofition of the feces, give to them a lfoney hardnefs. RECTUM. The rectum forms the laft divifion of the great inteftines; and I know no better proof of the imprac- ticability of altering the names in anatomy than this, that anatomifts have, in almofi every age, infilled on the impropriety of calling this gut, which anfwers in its lhape to the curve of the facrum, a ffcraight gut; and yet always, and to the prefent day, it is redlum. From the lail turns of the colon, called fegmoid, the gut is continued over the promontory of the halt verte- bra and facrum (a little to the left fide), and falls into the pelvis. It runs down, in a curved direction, be- twixt the facrum and bladder of urine. In the upper part it is covered by the peritoneum, and has its fatty appendages like the colon, but lefs regular ; and fome- times the fat merely depofited under the peritoneal coat. It is tied down by the peritoneum, in form of mefo-redlum ; but, deeper in the pelvis, it lofes the pe- ritoneum (which, as we have laid, is reflefted up upon the back of the bladder, and forms here lateral folds), and the redlum is connected with the lower part of the bladder and vellicufe feminalis by cellular mem- brane. In women, the mufcular fibres of the redtuin and vagina are intimately conne&ed *. * Window. The

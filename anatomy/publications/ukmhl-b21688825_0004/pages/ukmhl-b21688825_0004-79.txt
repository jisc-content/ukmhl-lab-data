OF THE STOMACH. 47 cellular coats. For thefe fubdivifions, however, I fee no ufe, nor are they authorifed by the natural appear- ance of the coats of the ftomach. When there is a diftinftion in texture, ftru&ure, or function, and where thefe lamina can be feparated, we Ihould confider them as coats; but a mere intermediate tifiue of vefiels, ,or the connecting cellular membrane, are improperly confidered as diPcinft tunics. First coat.—From what has been already faid of the peritoneum, it will readily be allowed that the outer coat of tjie ftomach is formed by the peritone- um ; a coat common to all the inteftines. Were this not fufficiently evident in itfelf, it might be afcertained by difieCting the peritoneum from the cardiac orifice of the ftomach, where it will be found reflected from the diaphragm. This coat is firm, Ample in its tex- ture, having no apparent fibrous texture, and fmooth on its outer furface, with many minute vefiels. Under the peritoneal coat is the firft cellular coat, being in faCt a fliort cellular tiflue betwixt the peritoneal coat and the mufcular coat. Muscular coat.—The mufcular coat of the fto- mach confifts chiefly of two lamina of fibres; lefs diftinCt however than thofe of the oefophagus, or, in other words, more clofely and irregularly connected. One fet of fibres runs longitudinally, that is, from the one orifice to the other; the other fet runs encircling the ftomach ; yet there are fuch irregularities that it is difficult in every place to recognize the two great and original divifions of fibres ; and on this account in general -three ftrata or feries of fibres are de? 5 fcribed.

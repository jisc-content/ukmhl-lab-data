80 OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. flipping of one portion of the gut within another*. This may be done by applying acrid matter to the in- teflines of living animals; and I have no doubt that it has been produced by giving purges too ftrong and ftimulating in cafes of obftru&ion of the bowels. By the contractions of the murcular coat greatly excited, the inteftine is not only diminifhed in diameter fo as to refemble an earth-worm *, but in length alfo. This great contraction of the outer coats accumulates the vafcular and villous coat as if into a heap ; which from the compreflion of the mufcular coat is forced into the neighbouring relaxed portion. This firft ftep leads only to a fucceflion of actions; for the fibres of the relaxed or uncontra&ed part, fenfible to the prefence of this accumulated and turgid villous coat, contracts in fucceflion fo as to draw a part of the contracted gut within the relaxed portion. If the irritation is done away or ceafes quickly, as in the experiments on ani- mals, another turn of the inteftine coming into play diflends this, and undoes the intus-fufceptio. But if the caufe continues, the intus-fufceptio is continued; the included part of the gut is farther forced into the other. By thefe means the veflels going to the in- cluded part are interrupted; the villous coat fwells more and more ; and feveral feet of the upper portion of the inteftine is often in this way fwallowed down. It is not however in the natural courfe downward that this preternatural adtion always proceeds; for, as the excitement is violent and unlike the ufual ftimulus of * See Haller’s Experiments ; and “ DifTeflions of the Atro- phia A-blaftatQrum with plates; by Dr. Cheyne. food,

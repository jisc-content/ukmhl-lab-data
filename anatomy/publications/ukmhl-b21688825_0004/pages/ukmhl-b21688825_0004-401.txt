Upon the third vertebra, the azygos vein feparates from the ft ine, and with an arch, and bending round the root of the lungs, it opens into the fuperior cava, juft where it is about to enter the pericardium : where St opens into the great vein, it is guarded by a valve. This vein however, like mod others, has confider- able variety, and does not always merit the name of azygos, for fometimes it is double, a divifion afcending son the left fide of the fpine, and uniting with the branch of the other fide, juft as it is about to enter Into the fuperior cava. Of the lesser veins in the thorax.—The ve- nal mammari ae take a courfe by the fide of the in- ternal mammary artery, and require no defcription. Like the arteries, they fpread their branches on the muf- cles of the belly,- and communicate with the diaphrag- matic and lumbar and epigaftric veins. The left mam- mary vein terminates in the left fubclavean vein, the yight in the fuperior vena cava. The venae thymic^ enter, either into the union of the fubclavean veins, or they enter into the guttu- ral veins, or the internal mammary veins. The pericardiac veins gather their branches from the pericardium, from the aorta, trachea and lymphatic glands; they fend down branches by the fide of the phrenic nerve, which inofculate with the ■v^'ns of the diaphragm ; they enter the internal mam- mary

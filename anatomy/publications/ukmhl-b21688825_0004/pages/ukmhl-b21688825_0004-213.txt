' OF THE TESTES. l8l have the middle ftage of the defcent reprefented : and, in the third, we have the full defcent. In the iecoud figure, A is the body of the tefticle, B is the fir ft peritoneal covering or tunica albuginea, which can be eafily traced, refle&ed off from the loins at C ; again, D is the portion of the peritoneum, which hav- ing defcended before the tefticle is prefently, when the tefticle has fully defcended, to become the fecond, or vaginal coat of the tefticle; F is the continuation of the peritoneum upon the infide of the abdominal mufcles. In the third figure of this feries, we find the tefticle A has defcended into the fcrotum; that it has one coat covering it, which we recognize to be the fame with B, in the firffc figure, and that the peritoneum in this third plate at B, can be traced to C, the peritoneum within the belly. Now fuppofing this to be the ftate of the tefticle immediately after it has defcended, we fee that there is ftill a communication betwixt the cavity of the mni- ca vaginalis D, and the cavity of the peritoneum E. F is the kidney, covered by the peritoneum, and near- ly in the fituation in which the tefticle was before its defcent.

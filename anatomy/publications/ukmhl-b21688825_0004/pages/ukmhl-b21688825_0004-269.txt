/ OF THE VAGINA, ETC. 227 The vagina has three coats; that is to fay, it has the inner coat, or furface, a few mufcular fibres, and arohnd it a condenfation of the furrounding cellular membrane, which may be confidered as the third coat. The internal, or villous coat, is a reflexure of the delicate covering of the external parts. It is of larger extent, or longer than the others; and is therefore tucked up into rugae, which run acrofs the vagina. They are more remarkable on the fore and back part of the vagina; they are lefs in married women, and confiderably obliterated by repeated labours. To fupply a vifcous fecretion for the defence of this furface, mucous 'glands are numeroufly, but irregu- larly fcattered over it, and they are particularly nu- merous at the orifice. The mufcular coat is not very ftrong, nor are the fibres diftinft, from which fome have fufpefled their exiftence, alleging, that there is here only condenfed cellular membrane, and that the contra&ion of the vagina is the effect of mere elafticity. I obferve fo great a profufion of venous vafcularity, that I prefume the vagina fuffers an inflation of its coats, and confe- quently contraction from an afflux of blood to it. The mufcular fibres are, however, as we have faid, gathered into fafciculi near the orifice, fo as to be diftinftly vifible. The firmnefs and ftrifture of the vagina fupport the womb ; the dilatation of the vagina, the relaxation which old age, and frequent labours produce, occa- fion the falling down of the womb. It is a difeafe al- moft peculiar to thofe who have borne many children, to the old, weak, and relaxed, and to thofe who are fubjeft to the fluor albus; every flux from the womb, 0*4 or

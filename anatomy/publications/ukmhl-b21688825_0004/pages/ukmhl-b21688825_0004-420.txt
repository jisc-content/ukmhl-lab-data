We are indebted to M. Heriflant for much of the explanation of the manner in which the enamel is formed. He defcribes the fac *, its attachment to the pulp, and to the neck of the teeth,â€”as the tooth advances to its perfect form, the fac alfo changes. At firft it is delicate and thin, but it thickens apace. And he afierts, that if after this progrefs is begun you examine the inner furface of it with a glafs, you will perceive it to be compofed of little veficles in regular order, and which fometimes have a limpid fluid contained in them. This liquid exuded upon the furface of the teeth he fuppofes to form the enamel. He explains alfo how this fac, originally inverting the body and neck of the tooth, being pierced by the edge of the tooth, and the tooth rifing through it, is inverted, and by ftill keeping its connection with the circle of the crown of the tooth, rifes up in connexion with the gum, and in fome de- gree forms the new gum which furrounds the tooth.

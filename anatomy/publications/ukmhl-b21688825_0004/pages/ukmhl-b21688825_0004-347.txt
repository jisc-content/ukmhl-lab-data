AND OF THE DOCTRINE OF ABSORPTION. 305 more irritable, more vafcular (I will venture to fay), and more liable to inflammation than the veins j yet are the veins affefted in a way that wou'd as unequivocally prove them to be abforbents, for we fee how they enlarge around a difeafed bread, become prominent and hard, and lofe their foftnefs and eladicity. But, as we would not fay that this is a proof of abforption by the veins, neither is the proof unequivocal that there is abforption by the lymphatics. Again, a fup- purating dump, with bad inflammation, will caufe. inflammation of the lymphatics, and fuppuration in the glands of the groin * ; a proof of abforption of the matter of the dump: but we do not find that from fuch a dump the veins afcend, inflamed and fuppurat- ing, while fometimes a chain of abceflfes is formed for a confiderable extent. This, we can have no doubt, is the effect of the inflammation continued along the veflel; and is not the inflammation produced precifely in the lame way in the lymphatic ? I found my opinion of the lymphatics being abfor- bents,—fird, on the circumdance that their dru&ure is adapted to this a&ion; fecondly, on the analogy between them and the ladeals, in which abforption is proved; thirdly and ladly, upon their continuing to receive and tranlmit their'fluids, after the heart and arteries have ceafed to beat, and the red blood to circulate : for then how can they act, but by their own powers? How can they receive fluids, but by abforption? Finally, this phe- nomenon fnows in the lymphatics, a greater degree of irritability, and Aronger principle of activity and ten- acity of life, than actuates any other fet of ved’eis. * See Hunter’s Commentaries, x 3 Of

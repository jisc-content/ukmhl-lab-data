AND OF THE DOCTRINES OF ABSORPTION. 299 forption be the mod beautiful and interefting, and apparently the fimpleft in the whole ceconomy, yet it is founded on verv few facts, while there is much doc- trine tacitly acknowledged, which feems in fymmetry with the fa£ts and the laws of the ceconomy, but which is not founded in abfolute proof. We lhall firft exa- mine the proofs of the lymphatics being the veflels which abforb the fluids of the cavities and furfaces of the body. The animal machine univerfally partakes of motion. A principal provifion for this mobility of parts, is the loofenefs of the cellular membrane which every where pervades the body, and fupports the veflels and connects the feveral parts. This interflitial membrane is elaftic, and being cellular, to allow of motion, its furface is bedewed with ferous exudation. This fluid is perpetually palling from the extremities or fides of the lymphatic arteries or capillaries, into the cellular membrane, and upon all the cavities of the body. The fluid extravafated is called lymph, and fome have fuppofed that it pafles through inorganized pores, an exprefiion that is not very intelligible ; but if by this is meant (as has fometimes been explained) “ accidental pores” in the fides of the veflels, it is a fuppofition quite improbable and unlikely *. The * Dr. Hunter fupported this opinion (Commentaries p. 40,) viz. “ that the fluids 6f cavities were collected by tranfudation, and not thrown out by exhalents an opinion which could only have arifen from not correcting the ideas received in making injections in the dead body by the phenomena of the living fyftem. See Hewfon on the Lymphatic Syjlem, chap. viii. where the opinion of inorganical filtering is fuccefsfully combated.—See alfo Cruick- Ihanks. pores

2^ OF THE PERITONEUM. peritoneum lining the abdominal mufcles and that part of it which inverts or forms the outer membrane or coat of the intertines. This fluid, whether collected there by difeafe or thrown in by experiments, has no natural outlet, nor does it tranfude in the living body *. BLOOD*VESSELS OF TIIE PERITONEUM. As the peritoneum is a membrane of great extent, and inverting a variety of parts, its veflels come from many fources. It receives arteries and veins from the mammary veflels; from the phrenic and epigaftric veflels; from the lumbar arteries and veins; and from the ilio-lumbalis, circumflexa ilii, renal, and fpermatic arteries. It receives nerves from the intercoftal, lum- bar, and diaphragmatic nerves. It would appear that difeafe has given rife to the opinion that the peritoneum has in it many little glands. This is controverted decifively by Morgagni. * Soemmerringj Corp. Hum. Fab. Contemp. Peritonei, § iii. We not unfrequently find an accurate general defcription in authors, but fome incorreXnefs in the fubordinate detail ; which throws back the ideas of the reader into confufion. Such is the enumeration of the holes or perforations of the peritoneum, “ pour donner paflage a 1’cefophage, a la veine-cave,” See- See Anatom. Chirurg. par M. Palfin. We fee that there are no fuch perforations, that the oefophagus never enters into the cavity of the peritoneum, nor does the redum pafs out from its cavity. This was indeed explained by Fernelius in oppofition to Galen. See a defcription of the inflexions of the peritoneum by Bartho- lin.—Specimen Hiftorits Anatomies: AnaleX. Ob. I. OF

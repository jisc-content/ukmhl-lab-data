27I' OF THE WOMB. Of the placenta as the source of nourish- ment to the fcetus. When we confider thp mere fpeck of the embrio in the fir ft weeks, we fee that it can have no other fource of nouriihment than through the extreme veffels of the chorion, connected with the Ihort umbilical cord ; and we may be convinced alfo, that in its progrefs to maturity, when the general connexions of the chorion ceafe, and the placenta is formed, the foie fupply is through its veffels. Regard- ing the manner of the communication betwixt the vef- iels of the mother and child there are many opinions. The fimpleft explanation, but the furtheft from the truth is, that the arteries of the womb are continued into the veins-of the foetal portion of the placenta. That on the other hand, the arteries of the foetal fyftem are continued into, or inofculate with the veins of the womb; and that thus, the blood of the motherâ€™s fyftem is carried by ,dired inofculation. A little in- vestigation will convince us, that this is a very unlikely conjedure. . We fee the embrio furrounded with its veffels, and forming a complete fyflem within itfelf, defcend into the womb. We fee that the attachment betwixt the furface of the ovum and the womb, de- pends on a reciprocal adion betwixt them ; and when the foetus is feeble, or difeafed, or when it dies, the uterus immediately feparates from it, as from a dead part, and there is an abortion. Again, it is not na- tural to fuppofe, that the circulating fluids of the adult are calculated for the circulation in the embrio, or that the blood of the adult is fit for the circulation of the foetus. When we injed the veffels of the foetus, we find the veins and arteries of the umbilical cord to in- T 2 ofculate

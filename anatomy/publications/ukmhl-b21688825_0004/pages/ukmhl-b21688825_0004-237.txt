Thefe are copioufly fupplied with arteries; their furface is covered with veins and lymphatics when thefe veflels are minutely injected, and their coat is thick and fpongy. Heifier, Winflow, and others, have defcribed fmall glands as feated in their finunfi- ties; but thefe are confidently denied, and in their place there is defcribed a pile or efflorefcence. There can be little hefitation in affirming, that thefe vehicular are themfelves glands, or, in other words, that the arteries fecrete into them a peculiar fluid. The fore- part of each of the veficuke, which we have faid fink into the back part of the proftate gland, runs under the neck of the bladder, and opens by diflintt mouths into the urethra, on the furface of the verumon- tanum. The connexion of the vas deferens with the vefi- culte, is very particular, it does not open direClly into them, but opens with them into the urethra in fuch a way, that the femen from the tefticle can pafs into the veficulse, though its direCl courfe is into the urethra *. If air is blown into the vas deferens, the veficulx will be diftended at the fame time that the air paffes into the urethra : the union of the extremities of the vas deferens and veficulee, forms a kind of feptum be- twixt them. The extremity of the vas deferens joins the duct of the veficulas where it is imbeded in the proftate * See explanation of plate III. gland;

OF THE KIDNEV. 145 partaking of the colour of the arteries. Thefe are the glands of the cortical part of the kidney, which Mal- pighi defcribed as hanging upon the branches of the arteries like fruit upon the pendant branches, and round which the arteries and veins ramified and con- voluted, like delicate tendrils, fo as to give them the dark colour which they have. Into thefe bodies he fuppofed the urine to be fecret- ed, and from thefe bodies it was conveyed into the uriniferous du£ts or tubular part of the kidney ; but he acknowledges that the communication betwixt the ■duels and glands is very obfeure. Ruyfch and Vieulfens held a very oppofite opinion regarding the ftrufture of the kidney *. Ruyfch, by throwing his injections into the renal arteries, found that he filled the urinary tubes, the duels of Belini, and the pelvis itfelf. Hence he conjectured that the tubuli urmiferi or excretory du£ts of the kidney were the continued branches of the renal artery, without the intervention of any glandular apparatus f. * Ruyfch and Vieulfens long contended for the claim of the difeovery of the continuation of the arteries of the kidney into the urinary duds. Ruyfch at firlt accjuiefced in the opinion of Malpighi, as we have faid. f Thef. Anat. ii. p. 31. Vql. IV. L Examp1e

Glands are different not only in their outward form, their general appearance when cut into, and the manner of the connection of their parts, but alfo in a remarkable manner in the length, fize, and form of their veffel: and duds. In confidering the opinions of pbyfiologifls or ana- tomifts regarding glandular fecretion, and the ftrudure of glands, we find in the firft inftance that the old phyficians contented themfelves with faying that the glands or vifcera poflefled a peculiar power to feled and feparate the fluids from the blood. The next clafs had recourfe to hypothefis: they fpoke of the reparation of certain parts by means of fermentation or by a kind of filtering through the pores or veflfels of glands; that thefe pores allowed only particles of a particular fize or figure to pafs them f. It was oppofed to this hypothefis, that the thinner fluids mull have run through the organs defiined for the groiler fecretions. But when a theory fuch as this is received no argument nor proof feems neceflary to overthrow it. Refling upon authority alone, it flood until it was overturned by the falhion of new doflrines: one equally puerile was raifed upon its overthrow.

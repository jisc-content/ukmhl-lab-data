OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 79 in a greater proportion into C. While the contents of the middle portion are fent into the lower part in a greater proportion than into the higher divifion, the tendency of the food will be in its natural courfe, downward ; wbilft at the fame time it fufFers an alter- nate motion backward and forward ; fo that it is more extenfively applied to the abforbing furface of the inteflines. The ftimulus to the inteflines is matter applied to their inner coat ; and although there is much fympa- thy in the whole canal, yet unlefs there be matter within a portion of the canal, that particular part has little action. Accordingly, when there is obflruction to the courfe of the aliment, by whatever caufe it may be produced, the portion below becomes fhrunk and pale, and free from the eftedts of inflammation ; while that ftimulated by the food, being in a high date of excitement, irritated by the prefence of matter which it is unable to fend forward, evacuated only partially by an unnatural and highly excited retrograde adtion, it becomes large, thick in its coats, flrong in its muf- cular fibres, and greatly inflamed, till it terminate at laft in gangrene *. The unufual excitement of the mufcular fibres pro- duces a very curious effedi in the intus-fufceptio, or the * Haguenot gives an experiment illuftrating the caufe of ileus. He tied a ligature about the inteftine of a cat, and found no an- tiperiftaltic motion excited. This is not wonderful; it is the excitement arifmg from matter within the gut, to which there is no exit, and not the ftriiture of it, which is the caufe of the vio' lent fymptoms.â€”A cafe in the Mufeum will give the young fiudent a corrett judgment on this fubjeft. flipping

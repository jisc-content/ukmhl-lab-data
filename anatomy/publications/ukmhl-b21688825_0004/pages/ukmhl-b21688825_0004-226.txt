The vafa efferentia are very delicate veffels which run out from the head of the tefticle, fingle at firft, but they are foon convoluted, and by thefe con- volutions they are formed into an equal number of vafcular cones, which conftitute the head or larger part of the epididimis. Thefe vafa efferentia and vafcular. cones are connected by a very delicate cellular mem- brane ; and it is a piece of very nice diffeftion to dis- play them after they are injefted with mercury. Epididimis.—The vafa efferentia, after forming thin conical convolutions, unite and form larger tubes; thefe again uniting, form one large excretory duft, the •vas deferens: but this veffel being convoluted to a wonderful degree, forms a body, which, being as it * This body galled a mere frmamntum or binding, Winflow; tic nucleus teftis. ■ ■ '/ f were.

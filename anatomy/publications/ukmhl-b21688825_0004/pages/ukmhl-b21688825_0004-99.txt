OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 67 the coats of this firft divifion. The firft: or peritoneal coat is imperfect, as mull; already be underftood : for it does not invert the whole circumference of the gut; it ties it down more clofely, or it merely contains it in its duplicature, while a greater profufion of cellular mem- brane accompanies this than the other divifions of the intertines. The mufcular coat is ftronger than that of the jejunum and ileon ; the plies formed by the inner coats, fmaller than thofe of the other part of the fmall inteftine, and having more of a glandular ftru&ure. At the lower part of the firft incurvation of the duode- num, the inner coat forms a particular procefs like to thofe which are called valvulae conniventes ; and in this will be difcovered the opening of the biliary du6t, within which alfo the dudlus pancreaticus generally opens. It is not without fome reafon that anatomifts have confidered the duodenum as a feCond ftomach, calling it ventriculus fecundus, and fuccenturiatusj for there is here performed a change upon the food, converting the chyme, (as they have chofen to call it,) which is formed in the ftomach, into perfect chyle. But to fuppofe that the chyme is perfected in the duodenum, is to fuppofe the biliary and pancreatic fecretions ne- ceflary to the formation of chyle; a point which is not allowed: for many fuppofe that the bile is merely a ftimulus to the inteftines, holding a controul over their motions; others, that it is ufeful only in fepara- ting the chyle from the excrement; or again, that the bile is decompofed, part entering into the compofition of the chyle, while the other goes into that of the faeces; it feerns to beftow upon them a power of fti- F 2. muLating

INTRODUCTION. 22 Crypta are numerous in the body. We have an ex- ample of them in the great inteftines *. Crypta is a foft body, confiding of veflels not completely fur- rounded with a membrane, and refolvable by boiling or maceration f. Folicules are little bags appended to the extremity of the duds, into which the fecretion is made, and from which it is evacuated by the duds. Lacuna are little facs opening largely into the paf- fages, (as in the urethra,) and into which generally mucus is fecreted ; which, lodging there, is difcharged when matter moves along the paflage. Finally, we have to recoiled that every part of the body fecretes; that every furface is a fecreting furface ; that even that furface which is produced by an incifion no fooner ceafes to bleed than a fecretion begins. And that an ulcer in the fkin or flefli becomes by habit fimilar to thofe organs the peculiar fundions of which is to fecrete fome matter ufeful in the fyftem. This fad correds the notions which we ihould otherwife be apt to receive of the adion of fecretion from contem- plating the more complicated glandular organs. * Ruyfch ad Virum Clar. H.

STRUCTURE OF THE PENIS. 16/ A, Corpus Cavernofum Penis. B, Septum. C, Ure- thra. D, Corpus Sponge Minus, or fpongeofum Urethrae. Corpus spongeosum urethra. ' Surrounding the urethra there is a fpongy body fimilar to that which forms the body of the penis. Where this fpongy (heath of the urethra lies in the pe- rineum, betwixt the crura of the penis, it is enlarged with a round head, which is called the bulbous part;â€” it is upon this, and on about an inch and an half of the lower part of the fpongy body, that the ejacula- tor feminis, or accelerator urina; acts ; and, as within this enlargement of the fpongy body which furrounds the urethra there is alfo a dilatation of the tube of the urethra itfelf, the ufe of the mufcle is evident. It contrads upon this finus of the urethra when diftended with the difcharge from the veficulae, the proftate gland, and tefticle. As an accelerator urinae, it can- not ad, but it expels the laft drop of urine, as a con* fequence of their detention in this more dilateable part of the urethra. The fpongy (heath of the urethra, as we have hinted, is enlarged into the glans, fo that the ac- tion of the accelerator mufcle affeds the whole length of the fpongy body of the urethra and the glans by the compreffion of the blood in the bulb. There is a connedion betwixt the glans, fpongy tube of the urethra, and accelerator mufcle. The excitement of the glans gives the adion to the accele- rator or ejaculator mufcle ; the adion of this mufcle. M 4 compreSes

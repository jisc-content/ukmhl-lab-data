APPENDIX. 368 of the tooth, which go deep into the jaw. There is a cavity in the body of the tooth, and the tube of the fangs communicates with it. This cavity receives veftels for fupplying the remains of that fubftance upon which the tooth was originally forfiied. The roots of the teeth are received into the jaw by that kind of articulation which was caUed gomphofis. They are not firmly wedged into the bone, for, in confequence of maceration, and the deftrudion of the foft parts, the teeth drop from the fcull. There is betwixt the tooth and its focket in the jaw a common periofteum. Of the enamel. The furface of a tooth, that which appears above the gum, is covered with a very denfe hard layer of matter, which has been called the enamel. In this term there is fome degree of impro- priety, as afiimilating an animal produ&ion with a vitreous fubftance, although, the enamel very widely differs from the glafly fradure when broken. This matter beftows the moft efiential quality of hardnefs on the teeth ; but it is probably ufeful in another way, being intermediate betwixt the central bony' part of the tooth, which has life, and is fubjed to difeafe, and matter altogether foreign to the living body. When the enamel is broken off, and the body of the tooth expofed, it quickly decays. The enamel is the hardeft produdion of the animal body. It ftrikes fire with fteel: in church-yard fculls it is obferved-to refift decay when the centre of the tooth has fallen into duft. It has been found that the component parts of the enamel are nearly the fame with

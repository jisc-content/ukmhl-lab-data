OF THE WOMB. 241 lieve R 3 fucculent, as we obferve in the womb: for thefe caufes, the veflels being eafily dillenfible, the blood finds a more eafy paflage through the very foft fleecy exhaling veflels which open into the cavity of the ute- rus, as being there lefs refilled than in its return by the veins, or in taking a courfe through any other part; becaufe, in females, we obferve the arteries of the head are both fmaller, in proportion, and of a more firm re- filling texture. The return of the fame is, therefore, more flow, both becaufe the flexures of the arteries, from the increafed afflux of the blood, become more ferpentine and fit for retarding the blood’s motion *, and likewife, becaufe it now returns with difficulty through the veins. The blood is therefore firll col- iedted in the veflels of the uterus; next, it is accumu- lated in the arteries of the loins, and the aorta itfelf, which urging on a new torrent of blood, augments the force fo far as to difcharge the red blood into the ferous veflels, which at firll tranfmit an increafed quantity of warm mucus, afterwards a redilh coloured ferum, and by buffering a greater dillenfion, they at tail emit the red blood itfelf. The fame greater im- pulfe of blood determined to the genitals, drives out the hitherto latent hairs, increafes the bulk of the cli- toris, dilates the cavernous plexus of the vagina, and whets the female appetite to venery, &c.” We cannot give implicit trull to luch fpeculation, we cannot believe in this plethora, produced by the diminifhed growth of the limbs; neither can we be- * I have fhown that the tortuous arteries always form a pro- vision for the occafional iucreafe of the adion and acceleration of the blood.

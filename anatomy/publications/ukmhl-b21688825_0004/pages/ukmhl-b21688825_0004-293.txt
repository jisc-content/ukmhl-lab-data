OF THE WOMB. 25 I and the bud rifes to the furface towards the light, and the influence of the atmofphere. We fee in this inftance, that the operation of the fyftem of tubes of the embryo plant in the albumen was merely fufpended, that upon the feed being put into the ground, the heat and moifture promote the germination, by driving the nutritious matter of the albuments to the embryo plant. In the firft ftage of this change, the matter abforbed by the veflels of the albumen fupply that nourifliment, which afterwards is conveyed from the root ftriking into the earth, and from the leaves abforbing from the atmofphere. And when the roots have ftruck into the earth, and the firft leaves rife upon the furface, the lobes of the al- bumen are exhaufted and fade, or rife up in form of leaves, Hill cherifhing the tender plant. When we come accurately to examine the fituation of the embryo in oviparous animals, we fhall find the fame provifion for the nourifliment and growth of the young animals, independent of external circumftances, nourifliment prepared for it until it fhall be enabled to gain flrength to feed itfelf. The manner in which an egg is formed is this: The yolk, with its delicate membranes, are formed in the ovarium of the hen. The ovarium is placed on the back-bone, innumerable yolks are feen gradually formed, and fucceffively increafing in fize. When they are matured, they are of the full fize we fee them in the perfect egg ; they are furrounded with a delicate web of membranes, extremely vafcular, which burfts when they are mature and impregnated, and then they fall into, or are grafped by the infundibulum, or what anfwers

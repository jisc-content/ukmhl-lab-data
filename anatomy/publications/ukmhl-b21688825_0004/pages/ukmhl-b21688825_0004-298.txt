For, I am apt to conceive, the red blood to be formed only after feveral rounds of the circulation, and to depend upon a more perfect aflimulation than that firft: excited : and that Mr. Hunter is all along in this miftake, that he is fuppofing thefe veflels to be newly formed, which are laid in the conftitution of the membranes furrounding the embryo, and which are now only called into adion, and only become ap- parent when they convey red blood. In the fyftem of the egg there are other circum- ftances worthy of notice: as the chick grows by the ab- ' forption of the white, Â©r albumen, the new combina- tions reduce to a lefler bulk the whole mafs, which is within the (hell, and now we perceive the ufe of the air-cell, which enlarging, fills up this fpace. When the chick has efcaped from the fhell, the yolk of the egg is not exhaufted, but it is found to be received into the belly of the chicken, and to have a conduit leading into the duodenum, by which it is poured into the in- teftinal canal.

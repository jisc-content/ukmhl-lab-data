OP THE PROSTATE GLAND. 163 bladder, and points forward. It has alfo a divifion, forming it into two lobes; and the older anatomids fpeak of it as double. The urethra paffes through it; not in the middle, but towards its upper furface; fo that the gland is felt more prominent downward, and is didinclly felt by the point of the finger in ano. This glarid indeed reds, as it were, on the redtum. By .the annexed drawing *, it is meant only to give an accurate conception of thefe parts, and not to repre- fent them as they are felt in the living body. For this reafon the drawing is made from a preparation, and not from the recent diffection. When the catheter is introduced, and the furgeon examines the date of parts by the redlum, he will fird didinguilh the curve of the dad, covered with the bulb of the urethra : be- hind this the catheter will feel more bare of parts, but dill covered with a greater thicknefs of parts than one ihould expedl from the defcription of the membrane- ous part of the urethra. And behind this, again, he will feel the prominence of the prodate gland, not round, didindt and accurately defined, but gradually lod in both before and behind, among.the furround- ing cellular membrane and mufcular fibres which in- volve it. The texture of the gland is a compadt fpongy fub- dance, and when cut has confiderable refemblance to a fchirrous gland. From each lobe there are fmall folicules opening into the urethra, and from thefe the dndh may be injedled, * Plates III. andIV. M 2 It

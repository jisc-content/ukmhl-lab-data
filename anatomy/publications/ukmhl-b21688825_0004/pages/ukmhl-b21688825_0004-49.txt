INTRODUCTION J9 C 2 The What he favv., This I believe to be one reafon of the rapid progrefs of Ruyfch’s opinions. i i The fmaller arteries which do not enter into folicules, but aTe convoluted. 2 2 The appearance of bodies or bags, but which are merely owing to the convolutions and tortuous figure of the arteries before they terminate in the excretory dufts. 3 3 Excre* tory ducts or veflels formed by the continued extreme branches of the arteries *. * Ruyfch’s doctrine again was thus oppofed: “ Ruyfchius “ auget arte fua replendi extenfionem vaforum ultra naturalem “ magnitudinem. Ruyfchius arte fua deftruit glandulas ; dein “ negat. Ruyfchius negat omnes glandulas. Melius eft & tu- “ tius omnia hsec demonftrare in cadavere recenti.” F. Ruyfch Ep’ft. ad Vir. Clar. Her. Boerhaave, p. 50. It maybe farther obferved, that it was not in the mere facft of there being folicules, in which Malpighi and Ruyfch differed ; for the latter conceded that there were hollow membranes, but contended that thefe were not glands. Their difference of opi- nion is expreffed in the following worfts of Ruyfch : “ Adeoque difcrepantia inter magnum ilium virum et inter me eft, quod ille putathumores delabi in glandulas dictas fimpliciftimas,—ibi foveri, mutari : Ego puto, quod arteriae ultima: luccos faciant, Sc fados ibi deponant.” t / 2

189 OF THE TESTES. from the hypogaftric artery: this branch funs up- ward, connected to the vas deferens, as it rifes out of the pelvis. Thefe arteries, taking their courfe under the perito- neum, join the fafciculus Forming the cord, and fup- ply the cord, and fend twigs to the inverting perito- neum ; they then pafs through the abdominal ring, and in their courfe they are beautifully tortuous. The veins of the tefticle rife on the right fide from the trunk of the cava, a little below the emulgent vein, and from the emulgent vein on the left fide. In the origin of thefe veins there are frequent varieties 5 there is alfo, accompanying the vas deferens, a vein, which joins the internal iliac vein. Thefe veins, in their courfe from the tefticle, are protected from the column of blood, and from the bad confequences of compreffion, by numerous valves. Thefe valves are very ftrong, and will bear a great column of mercury before they give way or burrt. This plexus of convo- luted veins of the cord is the raoft beautiful in the body. This convoluted ftate of the veins is ever at- tendant on great a&ivity and exertion of the arteries of the part. If there is a provificn in the fhape, courfe, and ftrength of the arteries, for occafional acceleration of the blood through them ; fo will there be found in the veins a tortuous and varicofe appearance j and again, if by accident there is excited an uncommon aflion in the arteries of a living body, that asrtion will be apparent from the diftended or enlarged ftate of the veins. In the tefticles of fuch animals as have their feafons, the artery and veins of the teflicle are ftill more convoluted.

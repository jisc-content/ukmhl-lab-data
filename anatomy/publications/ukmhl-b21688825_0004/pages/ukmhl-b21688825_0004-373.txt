OF THE COURSE OE THE LYMPHATICS. 331 laCteal veflels is difficult and precarious. The difficulty arifes from thefe veflels being in general empty in the dead body; from the impoffibility of injecting them from trunk to branch in confequence of their valves ; and, ladly, from their orifices never being patent, except in a ftate of excitement. The anatomift mud therefore watch his opportunity when a man has been fuddenly cut off in health, and after a full meal. Then the villi of the inner coat may be feen turgid with chyle, and their ftructure may be examined. Perhaps the firft obfervations which were made upon this fubjeft by Lieberkuhn, are ftill the bed and the mod accu- rate. The villi are apparently of a cellular ftruCture, for although they are fiat or conical, or like filaments when collapfed; yet when minutely injected, and efpecially when they are full of chyle, they take a globular form, and are called the ampuhjljE. Their didention, in confequence of a minute injection of the veins or arteries, is probably owing to a cellular druc- ture (which they feem to have) into which the in- jection has extravafated. The mod probable account of the druCture of thefe ampululae is that this cellular druCture is a provifion for their inflation and ereftion. by the blood, when excited by the prefence of the chyle in the intedines; that this erection gives rigidity to the orifice of the laCteals ; and that the fird dep of abforption is by capillary attraction, while the further propulfion of the fluid in the extreme abforbents is by the contraction of their coats excited by the prefence of the fluid. Thus the abforption is not by an inor- ganized pore, but depending on excitement and aCtion. B ' Lieberkuhnâ€™s

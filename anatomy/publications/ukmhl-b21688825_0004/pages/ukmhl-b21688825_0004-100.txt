OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 68 mutating the inteftinal canal in a greater degree; and as the chyle is formed occafionally without the pre- fence of bile, we may be induced the more readily to allow that the bile does not in the natural attions and relations of the fyftems enter into the compofition of the chyle. At all events, we fee that it is the bile which is the peculiar ftimulus of the inteftinal canal, and that when interrupted in its difcharge from the duifts, the motions of the belly are flow, and coftive- iiefs is the conference. We fee, then, that at all events there are poured in- to the duodenum from the liver and pancreas, fecretions which have an extenftve effect on the fyftein of the vifcera ; and we muft acknowledge that the defange- ment of tbefe fecretions muft operate as a very frequent and powerful caufe of uneafinefs, and-that the duode- num muft often be the feat of difeafe and diftrefling fymptoms. We may obferve that, from the courfe of the duodenum, pain in it fliould be felt under the feventh or eighth rib, paffing deep, feeming to be in the feat of the gall-bladder, and ftretching towards the right hypochondrium, and to the kidney, and again appearing as if on the loins. We may obferve farther, that from the connections of this portion of the intef- tine, and from the manner in which it is braced down by the mefocolon, fpafm, when flatus is contained in it, will fometimes produce racking pains. Nay farther, when the irregularities of digeftion affeCt the duode- num, and fpafm and diftention follow; the diftention caufes it to prefs upon the gall-bladder, and the pref- fure and the excitement together caufe an irregular and often an immoderate flow of bile, which with the acrid

334 OF the course of the lymphatics, when they emerge from the firft into the fecond glands* fecondary lafteals, and glands of the fecond order. The manner of the entering and going out of glands is exaftly the fame with that of the lymphatics. The lafteals (or perhaps we fhould now fay the abforbents merely) of the great inteftines, are fmaller and lefs numerous than thofe of the fmall inteftines ; for al- though the inteftines be large, Hill their inner furface is by no means fo extenfive : befides the chyle is ab- forbea, and the contents altered before they have defcended into the great inteftines. Both Window and Haller, however, alfert, that they have feen chyle in the abforbents of the great inteftines. We know that the la&eals abforb chyle, when it is prefented to them : while at other times they abforb different fluids. That the abforbents of the great inteftines imbibe the fluids contents is evident, from the change produced on the faeces in their paffage. Copious and nutritious injections have been given, which did not return in the fame liquid form, and which have fupported the ftrength for fome time. Clyfters of turpentine give the urine a fmell of violets; and the Peruvean bark has cured fever, when given by the retlum. The abforbents of the ftomach form three divifions: one fet accompany the coronary artery and vein, and enter the glands on the leffer curvature and omentum minus. Thofe of the fecond fet accompany the left gaftro-epiploic artery, and are joined by the lymphatics of the omentum. The third pafs down upon the upper part of the duodenum following the arteria gaftrica dextra; thefe defcend to pafs into the fame clafs of glands, which receive the lymphatics of the livep.

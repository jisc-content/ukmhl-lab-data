APPENDIX. 374 fupport the idea of there being a diftindion in the economy between the manner of the formation of the teeth, and of common bone. The effeds which we perceive in the bony fyftem under thefe difeafes, are produced by a preponderance of the abforbents over the adivity of the fecreting vefiels; while in the teeth no fuch effed can take place if they are formed by a depofition of bony matter which is not re-abforbed, nor undergoes the revolution of depofition and re- abforption, as in other parts of the body is the cafe. Accordingly we find in rickets, and the molities oflium, where the hardeft bone yields, where the jaw-bone itfelf is diftorted or altered in its form, that the teeth remain diftinguilhed for their fize and beauty; and in rickets the teeth are large, and perfedly formed, while the jaws are (tinted and interrupted in their growth. The confequence of this is, that the teeth form a larger range than the jaw, and give a charaderiftic protu- berance to the mouth. The roots of the teeth are fometimes found enlarged, diftorted, or with exoftofis formed upon them. Again the cavity of the tooth is found to have been filled up with the formation of new matter, or around the fangs we often find a fmall fac of pus, which is fometimes drawn out in extrading the tooth. Neverthelefs, in thefe examples of difeafe, there are no unequivocal marks of vafcular adion in the teeth; the unufual form, or exoftofis of the roots, is produced by an ori- ginal defed in the formation. The filling up of the cavity of the tooth is caufed by the refumed offific adion of the pulp in confequence of the difeafe and deftrudion of the body of the tooth j and the abfcefies i which

140 OF THE KIDNEY. the gland, which is feen in brutes; and that in man it is not fo remarkable, the ureter branching with only a leffer degree of the facculated form into three or four divifions, and thefe into the leffer infundibuli. The coats of the ureter are three in number ; a denfe outer coat; a middle coat, apparently confiding of circular mufcular fibres, though this has been denied; and a fmooth inner coat, (very improperly called villous,) which fecretes a mucus to defend it from the acrimony of the urine. The ureters do not run in a direft courfe to the bladder of urine ; they take a curv- ing dire&ion; are in fome places irregularly dilated, as when they pafs over the pfoas mufcle *, dropping deep into the pelvis, and getting betwixt the rectum and bladder they open obliquely into the latter. MINUTE STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEY. The ancients, fays Malpighi, contented themfelves with the idea of a fieve, as conveying a knowledge of the manner in which the urine was drawn off by the kidney ; that the fibres of its parenchematous matter attra&ed the ferum of the blood ; that the fibrous mat- ter was perforated with innumerable foramina ; or that the whole was a congeries of canals through which the urine was drained and drawn off. Malpighi fet him- felf .to refute thefe vague opinions by the minute' ex- amination of the dructure of the kidney; and he feems * When the bladder is contracted in confcquence of a hone, or when it is dilated by obftruCtion, the ureters are dilated alfo j particularly in the fir It cafe. Whilft they are dilated, their coats become thickened, and their courfe is tortuous. 9 to

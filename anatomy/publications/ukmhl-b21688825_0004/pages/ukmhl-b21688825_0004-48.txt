I 8 INTRODUCTION. naturally arifing from the novelty of the thing. But as to his fuperiority in the manner of difplaying the minute veffels of delicate parts, and his methods of preferving the parts in liquors, transparent and foft and to as to float in their natural folds, there can be no doubt. Neither can the minutenefs and fuccefs of his injections be denied : we have _cn many occafions in which we mud refort to the catalogue of Ruyfch’s mufeum for the true anatomy, to doubt his great fuccefs, or to quedion the truth of thofe encomiums which have been be- flowed upon him. Kings, princes, ambafladors, and great generals, but more than thefe, all the learned men of the time, crouded to the mufeum of Ruyfch. We mud not blame him if, whild others were merely fpeculating about the drudure of parts, he, furrounded by fo princely a mufeum, fhould Amply have laid open his cabinets, and bid them fatisfy therafelves whether or not he was right. Ruyfch’s preparations went to con- tradid the opinions of Malpighi. His injections, pulhed more minutely, (bowed thofe round bodies which are to be feen in feme of the glandular vifeera (and which Malpighi took to be little bags into which the fecreted fluid was poured) to be merely convoluted arteries. Ruyfch taught, that the minute arteries after making thefe convolutions terminated in the beginning of ex- cretory duds; that there was no fubdance or apparatus interpofed, but that, the veflels and duds were continu- ous. His opinions being formed upon the drength of more minute preparations, and a fuperior dexterity of anatomical invedigation, few anatomids c’nofe to be outdone, or to acknowledge that they could not fee 3 whar

OF THE ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS. 3II attion and more profufe difcharge, whilft it enlarges and fwells up. When a part enlarges in confequence of the ftimulus to increafed adtion, either arifing from the natural law of the conllitution or from difeafe, it pro- ceeds from the fecreting veffels preponderating over the abforbing veffels. There is a depofition of matter which the latter are unable to take away. But diminilh this adlion of the arteries, or take away their excitement, or caufe an excitement of fome neighbouring part, and thereby fubdue their adtion, relieve them of their fulnefs, and the abforbents regain their proportioned adlions, and the part fubfides. The parts of the body, which, in the natural changes from youth to age, are abforbed and carried away, are thofe in which there is no longer the (limulus to vigorous adlion, and of courfe the lym- phatics preponderate over the power of the fecreting veffels, and the part gradually diminilhes, lofes its ap- parent vafcularity, loles its rednefs, and is at laft totally abforbed. And as the tooth of a child lies long hid under the jaw, where it partakes of the ftimulus to the a&ion of its veffels, grows, and rifes up, and the al- veoli, partaking of this natural excitement, alfo form around it ; fo when the tooth decays and falls out, the alveoli will alfo decay and be abforbed ; becaufe the moment thefe veffels have ceafed to partake of the in- creafed adlion, their abforbents, though adling with no greater powers than formerly, do yet fo preponderate, that a gradual walling is the confequence. Thus we have to confider not the adlion of the abforbents merely, but the relation which their adlion has to that of the arteries. I would

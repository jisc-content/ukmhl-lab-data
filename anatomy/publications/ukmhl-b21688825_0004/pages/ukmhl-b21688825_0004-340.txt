29B ORIGIN OF THE LYMPHATICS. At prefent there feems no better hypothecs to be offered regarding the ufe of the lymphatic and la&eal glands, than that they ferve to check, controul, and meafure the flow of the abforbed fluids into the mafs of the blood : without them it appears to me probable that at one time the lymph returning from the body, or at another time the chyle, might flow too rapidly, and in a difproportioned quantity into the veins and heart. But by the check which the glands impofe upon this flow, giving a remora and ferving as receptacles of the abforbed fluids, thofe fluids are poured with a more uniform and conftant flow upon the heart. I / SECTION IV. ORIGIN OF THE LYMPHATICS, AND OF THE DOC- TRINES OF ABSORPTION. The lymphatics, forming a fyftem of abforbents, we might fay, in general, that they take up all the fluids which have been thrown out upon the furfaces of the body. Thus they arife from the furface of the Ikin ; from the furface of the cavities and vifcera covered by the pleura and peritoneum ; from the cells of the inter- flitial and adipofe membrane, &c. This is the Ample ufe afiigned to this fyffem of veflels: but whether they are the only fyftem of abforbents ; whether they carry away all the parts of the fyftem, fluids and folids ; whether they abforb the rnufcles, membranes, bones, tendons, &c. of which the folid body confifts, is a queftion requiring fevere examination. It cannot be denied that although the fyftem and do&rines of ab- forption

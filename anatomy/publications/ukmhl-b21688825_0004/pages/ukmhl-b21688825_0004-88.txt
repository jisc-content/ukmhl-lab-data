The bourborigmi and rumination feem to be gentler inverted a&ions of the upper orifice of the flomach and oefophagus, unaflifted by any great de- gree of compreffion of the ftomach by the abdominal jnufcles and diaphragm. The full attion of vomiting is preceded by infpira-. tion, which feems a provifion againft the violent excite*, ment of the glottis, and the danger of fuffocation from the acrid matter of the ftomach entering the wind-pipe; for by this means the expiration and convulfive cough accompanying or immediately following the adtion of vomiting, frees the larynx from the ejected matter of the ftomach. But the aftion of the diaphragm is far- ther ufeful by afting upon the mediaftinum, which embraces the oefophagus, and no doubt fupports it in, this violent action. NERVOUS OR VASCULAR COAT OF THE STOMACH, What Haller calls the nervous coat, is the cellular ftrufture in which the veffels and nerves of the flomach ramify and divide into that degree of minutenefs which prepares them for paffing into the innermoft or villous coat. It may with equal propriety be called the nervous, the vafcular, or the great cellular coat *. Taking it * To call it cellular coat, however, would be to confound it with the three cellular coats generally enumerated by authors. 4 as

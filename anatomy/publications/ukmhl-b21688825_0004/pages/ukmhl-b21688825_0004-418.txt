APPENDIX. evidently is to be found in the incapacity of alteration of fhape or fize in the teeth as in other parts of the body; the fmaller teeth, which rife fird, and are adapted to the curve and fize of the jaw-bone of an infant, require to be fucceeded by others, larger, ftronger, and carrying their roots deeper in the jaw. Each tooth is formed in a little fac, which lies be- twixt the plates of bone that form the jaw-bone of the foetus, or child, under the vafcular gum, and conne&ed with it. When we open one of thefe facs at an early period of the formation of the tooth, a very curious appear- ance prefents itfelf: A little (hell of bone is feen within the fac, but no enamel is yet formed. Upon raifmg the fhell of bone, which is of the fhape of the tooth, and is the outer layer of the bony fubdance of the tooth, a foft vafcular (tool, or pulp*, is found to have been the mould on which this outer layer of oflific matter has been formed; and a further obfervation will lead us to conclude that this bony and central part of the tooth is in the progrefs of being formed by fucceffive layers of matter thrown out from the furface of this vafcular pulp ; though many have explained the formation of the tooth, by fuppofing that the layers of this pulp were fucceffively offified. If we now turn our attention to the date of thofe teeth which we know to be later of rifing above the gum, we (hall find the ofiification dill lefs advanced, and a mere point, or perhaps feve.ral points of the depofited matter on the top of the pulp. * Le noyau, la coque, or le germe de la dent, by the French authors.

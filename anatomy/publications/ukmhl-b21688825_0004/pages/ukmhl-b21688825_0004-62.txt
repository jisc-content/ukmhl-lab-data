3Â° OF THE PERITONEUM; rounding mufcles. Sufficient example of this we have in hernia of the inteflines, in which the mefentery is greatly elongated., or in the difplacement of the fto; mach, or in the prolapfus and procedentia uteri. The peritoneum which forms the fac of hernia re- tains little elafticity, and does not (brink into the belly when freed from the outer adhefions; but the general peritoneum will allow great dillenfion, as in afcites, and quickly contract to its former dimenfions on the evacuation of the fluid ; and fo that part of the mem- brane which inverts the ftomach and inteftines the bladder of urine and gall bladder, has confiderable elafticity, fince it fullers thefe parts to be diftended and again returns to its former dimenfions. The confideration of the infufficiency of the perito- neum to retain the vifcera leads us to attend to a cir- cumftance of the greateft importance connected v.'ith the vifcera of the belly. The abdomen is everywhere (ex- cept towards the fpine) furrounded by mufcles. Above we fee,the diaphragm; before, and to the Tides, the abdominal mufcles; and even below, the parts in the pelvis are furrounded and compreffcd by the levator ani, in fuch a manner that the u'hole of the vifcera fufxer a continual preffure. This preffure upon the vifcera appears to be uniform and conftant, notwith- ftanding the alternate action of the abdominal mufcles and diaphragm as mufcles of refpiration : but it mud be occahonally very violent during exertions; in pull- ing, for example, or in (training, as a failor muft do in working of the great guns, or when pulling at the oar, or when balancing himfelf upon his belly over the yard-arm. And indeed by fuch violent and general comprefiion

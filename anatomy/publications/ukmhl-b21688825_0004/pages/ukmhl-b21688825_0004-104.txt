72 OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. The inftance only. Sometimes there is more than one in the courfe of the ileon *. MINUTE STRUCTURE OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. We have in fome meafure anticipated the genera! enumeration and chara&er of the coats of the inteftines, by what has been faid upon the coats of the ftomach; for we have here to diftinguifh the four great coats, the peritoneal, the mufcular, the vafcular, and villous coats, THE PERITONEAL COAT AND MESENTERY. The peritoneal coat of the fmall inteftines is of the fame nature with that of the ftomach, liver, fpleen, &c. It is a thin, fmooth, pellucid membrane. On the fur- face it has a moifture exuding from its pores; and it firmly adheres to the mufcular fibres beneath. Its tranfparency makes the mufcular fibres, blood-veflels, and lymphatics eafily diftinguifhable; and when it is differed or torn up, the longitudinal mufcular fibres will be found in general attached to it. Its ufe is to give a fmooth furface and ftrengthen the inteftine, and in a great meafure to limit the degree of this diften- tion. * The appendices cscales of the ileon have given birth to a curious queilion in the pathology of hernia.

In wet preparations, however, he obferved, that the ex- tremities of the branches of the hepatic artery opened into the vena ports : that the branches of the vena ports had a double termination: that fome of them, by a fudden turn and ferpentine courfe, terminated in the branches of the venae cavae hepaticse *; while others were feen to terminate or open into the biliary duels. Further he obferved, that in all the branches of the vena ports there was a peculiar comprelled appearance which diftinguifhed them from all the other veffels of the vifeus. There have been obferved, by almofl every author, interfe&ions of the intimate membrane of the liver, which divides and fubdivides the fafciculi of veffels. Thefe are, however, obfcure divifions. The lafl per- ceptible divifions have been called acinif; and they are rather prefumed than dire&ly proved to have in their compofition an extreme ramification of the feveral veffels of which the liver confilts J. We have feen Malpighi conceiving that thefe bodies were fimple glands collebled on the ramifications of the veffels; that they were little vehicles; and that from * I fhoulcl imagine that in this he might have been deceived by the lelfer branches of the porta; (filled with injection) opening into the fide of the larger trunks; and that there is no fuch ter- mination of the hepatic arteries in the tides of the venaportarum, fo that their open mouths are difcernable. f See the definition in the introduction to the prefent volume. t Acinos nemo rejicit, ne Ruyfchius quidem, fed de interiori fabrica difpatatur.

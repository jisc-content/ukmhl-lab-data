OF THE WOMB. 246 the ovaria, and their veflels, partaking of the general ex- citement of the fpermatic arteries, are enlarged, full of blood, and with every fign of increafed action. We find alfo, that the ovaria are matured and brought to pubulate, and almoft to ftart from their inverting membranes. Again, when we attend to the womb, we find, that thefe are marks of its whole vafcular fyftem being roufed to aflion. It has become laxer in its texture, and there is a change fimilar to what takes place in the firft ftage of pregnancy, but lefs in degree. The veflels on the inner furface of the womb have been influenced by an aftion fimilar to inflammation, and it is aflerted, that even the decidua is fometimes formed. Thus, while the ovaria are ripened to that' degree of maturity, which prepares them for impreg- nation, the furface of the womb, and its whole vafcu- lar fyftem, is preferved in a ftate of preparation for the adhefion of the ovum, when it (hall have defcended through the Falopean tube. I conclude that in con- fidering this fubjeft of menftruation, the mere circum- ftance of the difcharge of blood has been too much at- tended to, while thefe other more efiential circum- ftances have been negle&ed. It is not eafy to determine, fays Haller, either in this, or in any other fpontaneous haemorrhagy, from what kind of veflels the blood flows. From the cir- cumftance of the hsemorrhoidal difcharge, which cer- tainly is from veins, and from the lochia, which is ge- nerally fuppofed to be a difcharge from the venous finufes of the womb after delivery, we have the argu- ment of analogy, that in menftruation alfo it is a ve- nous difcharge. This opinion is further confirmed xo from

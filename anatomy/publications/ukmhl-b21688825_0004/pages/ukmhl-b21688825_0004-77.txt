45 OF THE STOMACH. a conical fac; the extremities of which being made to approach each other, gives it the curve of a hunterâ€™s horn, and gives occafion to the anatomift, in ftrift de- fcription, to remark thefe parts; the superior or cardiac orifice into which the oefophagus expands; the lower or pyloric orifice, which leads into the duodenum: the lesser and greater curvatures of the ftomach. The lefier curvature of the ftomach extends from be- twixt the two orifices; includes in its embrace the fpine, the aorta, and the fmall central lobe of the liver, while there is attached to it the lefler omentum. The greater curvature of the ftomach is the outline of its diftended belly, which riles above the arch of the colon, and is marked by the courfe of the gaftro-epiploic vefifels. When the ftomach is diftended the lower orifice is nearly on a level with the upper one; but when the ftomach is allowed to fubfide, it fails confiderably lower; fo that whilft the ftomach is lying acrofs the abdomen it is alfo tending obliquely downwards. The enfiform cartilage will be found to prefent com- monly to the middle of the ftomach ; and the lower orifice, when in its natural fituation, is oppofite to the foffa umbilicalis of the liver : the upper orifice is kept conftantly in one place from the ftrider connexion of the oefophagus with the diaphragm. Both orifices of the ftomach prefent backward, efpe- cially the upper one, while the lower one is pointed backward and downward. By the diftention of the ftomach the great arch is extended, the orifices are direfted more bapkward and towards each other, and efpecially the greater extremity draws upon the cefo- phagus.

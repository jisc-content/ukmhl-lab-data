OF THE ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS. 3°9 the relation in which the fecreting and abforbing vefels Hand to each other. He is fond of calling the abfor- bents, modellers,—modellers of the original con- ftrudion of the body,’7—c' modellers of the form of the body while growing.” No doubt he imderfiood that fucli terms from their novelty would be acceptable to minds incapable of real conviction, or of receiving or appreciating a new fact or idea. Mr. Hunter could contemplate no change in the body during growth, de<'ay, or difeafe, where there was an alteration of form or quantity of matter, without attributing it to the “ modelling abforption.” —A bone cannot be removed without abforption ; nor a part which is ufelefs to the ceconomy (as the alveoli of the teeth, the dudusarteri- ofus, the membrana pupillaris, the thymus gland) diminifhed in fize. or totally carried away, without the abforbents being in adion. This is undoubtedly true ; but in regard to the manner in which it is performed we cannot agree with Mr. Hunter. When it becomes neceffary that fome part fhouid be removed, it is evident that nature, in order to died tiiis, muff not only confer a new adivity on the abforbents, but muft throw the part to be abforbed into fuch a if ate as to yield to this operation. This is the only animai power capable of producing fuch eileds; and like all other operations of the machine, it arifes from Jiimulus or irritatiom &c. Now, this appears to be the fundamental error of Mr. Hunter’s dodrine. I conceive that the abforption of parts in the natural adion of health or in difeafe, is not owing toincrealed ftirnulus,butoften toadiminutionof it. Does it not flrike us forcibly that when a gland fwells, and leeches and biifters are applied, and it fubfides.

OF THE vagina; OF ITS SHAPE, CONNECTIONS, ETC. The vagina is a tube ftretching from the external orifice to the orifice of the womb. Its orifice is bounded below by the fourchette; above by the arch of the pu- bis ; and direCtly â€˜over it, or fometimes within it, is the orifice of the urethra; below, are the carunculae myrtiformes. It is furrounded by fafciculi of fibres, which are called the fphinCter mufcle. The canal of the vagina is of a conical form. At the outer orifice it is conftriCted by the fphinCter mufcle; but it is wider within, and where it receives the orifice of the womb. It may be diftended to almoft any degree, but naturally its fides, by their own elafticity, or the contraction of the furrounding fibres, or the prefiure of the furrounding parts, are in contaCt. In the natural date, the orifices of the vagina and womb, are but three or four inches diftant, often only two ; and fometimes, where there is a degree of relaxation, they are nearly in contact. In the firfh months of pregnancy, the orifice of the womb is kept down by the degree of difficulty the body of the womb has in fhooting up from the brim of the pelvis. But the gravid uterus rifing above the pelvis in the latter months, draws up the orifice of the womb, and ftretches the vagina.

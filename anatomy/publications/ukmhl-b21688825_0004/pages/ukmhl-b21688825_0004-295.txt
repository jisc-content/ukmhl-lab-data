253 CF THE WOMB. fo that they take a pretty firm hold on its tenacious fubfiance. Thefe chalaza are not fixed to the yolk in its axis, but to the fide, fo that the buoyancy of the yolk keeps it revolving as the egg is turned, fo as al- ways to prefent the cicatricula to the upper part of the egg, in whatever way it is placed ; confequently it is always contiguous to the body of the hen, fo as imme- diately to receive the influence of the maternal heat. By incubation, the principle of life in the chick and its membranes is roufed, and the firft perceptible change appears in little bloody dreaks, which, running together, form a circle of veflels, and, which, are feen to terminate in the umbilicus of the chick. This vafcular circle, the mod beautiful appearance of any in the ceconomy of animals, ought to be parti- cularly explained. In Mr. Hunter’s book treating of the blood, there is a plate which reprefents the embryo of the chick in the incubated egg, at three different ftages of its formation, beginning with the earlied vi- fible appearance of didinct organization.—The pre- parations from which thefe figures are taken, form part of a complete feries contained in Mr. Hunter’s colle&ion of comparative anatomy.—They are meant to illuftrate two pofitions laid down in his work, viz. that the blood is formed before the veflels, and when, coagulated, the veflels appear to rife ; that when new veflels are produced in a part they are not always elon- gations from the original ones, but veffels newly formed, which afterwards open a communication with the original. This to me feems an idea founded on a very limited view of the ftate of the parts. We mud recollect that Vol. IV. S this

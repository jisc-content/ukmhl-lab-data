OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. 92 but how much of the excrementitious matter in the colon is a human fecretion is not equally attended- to. Men who have died of want, and men exhaufted by long fever or other diftrefs, and who did not or were incapable of taking nourishment, have had difcharges pf feces ; and feces are found in their inteftines upon difiection.- The foetus has the inteftines filled with miconium *. The effedt of a purge is not only to ftimulate the inteftines to throw off their contents, but the inner fecreting furfaces pour out their fluids. The furface of the inteftines is not only calculated to abforb nourifhment, and capable of throwing off the fluids from the fyftem, like the kidneys in fecreting the urine, but it feetns deftined in a particular manner to carry off the earthy parts of the body, which in the circle of adtions is alternately undergoing renovation and decay. Thus the feces confift of the food and chyme, which has not been converted into chyle and abforbed, but which has been decompofed, and has entered into 'new combinations; it is united to part of the bile, which has alfo been decompofed ; to the fe- cretion of the pancreas; to the fecretion of the immenfe extent of furface of the inteftines; and many fubftances are found in the excrements which did not exift in the food. From the fame fources (viz, the fecretions poured into the inteftihal canal, or dire&ly from its furface) are formed concretions, often of an enormous fize; often diilinct from the nature of the more com- mon biliary fecretions f; and lbmetimes thefe earthy * See Haller Phif.

162 OF THE KIDNEY. there is ftili an inceffant accumulation in the bladder* even when the bladder has increafed to fuch a fize as to be compreffed by the action of the abdominal muf- cles. The caufe of this yielding of the bladder to the fecretion of the kidney is, that it has little permanent contraction, though occafionally its aftion is very great. The URiECus does not belong to the human blad- der. It is a tube which, in the foetus of quadrupeds, communicates betwixt the bladder of urine, and the membrane called alantoes. But in the human foetus there is no fuch communication; both in the foetus, and fomewhat lefs diftindtly in the adult, there is a ligament like the remains of the duft which runs up between the peritoneum and linea alba of the abdomen towards the umbilicus*. i â€¢ S E C T I O N II. OF THE PROSTATE, GLAND. On thegjeck of the bladder, and furrounding about half an inch of the beginning of the urethra, there is a gland nearly of the fize and figure of a chefnut. This body is called the proftate gland. In all the ex- tent of anatomy, there is not a more important fub- jeft for the attention of the furgeon than this of the fiae, relation and connexion, and difeafes (with their effefts) of the proftate gland : but to enter upon thefe is not now our objett. The fhape of this body is round, but at the fame time fomewhat pyramidal, for it is broad towards the * It has occurred, that the urine has been in part difcharged by the umbilicus. This, no doubt, is owing to the ligament re- maining permanently as a du&. bladder.

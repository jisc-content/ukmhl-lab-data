Jto INTRODUCTIONS which have been entertained regarding the ftru&urei of gland?. The peculiar nature of that organization by which the feveral fecretions are formed, has hitherto eluded abfolute proof by experiment or diffedion. It is imagined that there are fome organs which do little more than feparate the parts of the blood like to the exudation by exhaling arteries. But neither in the exhalent arteries nor in the fimpler organs can I imagine a fimple draining of the blood, but rather that the fame principle influences all, and that the feveral varieties of fecretion depend upon a modifica- tion of the adion. It would appear that the fluids in circulation and the veffels containing them mud reci- procally affed each other : we know that a change on the date of the circulating fluids will alter the nature of the glandular adion, and an excitement of the gland will dill more powerfully change the nature of the fecretion; the a dive power of the folids appearing to be an agent which controls and directs the che- mical affinities. We are druck with the variety of form in the fe- creting organs. We fee a fimple furface pouring out its fluids; or a fimple canal into which the arteries throw out the fecretion. We find again the fecreting veffels and their duds convoluted and mailed together forming proper glandular bodies; of which kind are the folid abdominal vifcera. When we diflect the glands we do not find them to have a fimilarity in Itrudure. Thus the fubdance of the liver, the kidney, the tedicle, &c. are quite unlike, and as their fecretions are different fo are their fym- 6 pathies.

APPENDIX. 365 the arteria circumflexa ilii. The external iliac vein is joined by the hypogastric vein which afcends from the pelvis. It requires no minute defcription ; it anfwers to the diftribution of the hypogaftric artery. This which is the internal iliac joining the trunk from the thigh forms the common iliac vein. Vena cava abdominalis *.—A little lower than the bifurcation of the aorta, the right and left common iliac veins unite. By this union they form the vena cava. This vein afcends upon the right of the aorta, It receives fewer branches than would naturally be imagined, be- caufe the veins of the vifcera take their courfe by the porta into the liver. It receives the lumbar veins the fpermatic veins, the renal, fuper-renal, and phrenic, veins. Paffing upward it is received into its appropriate foffa in the liver, and feceding a little from the fpine it receives the ven^e cavje hepatic^e and perforates the diaphragm ; entering the pericardium it expands into the great finus, or right auricle of the heart. Renal VEiNsf.—Thefe veins are Iefs irregular than the arteries of the kidney, which relation of the veins and arteries is uncommon. From the relative fituation of the kidneys to the cava it is evident that the right vein muft be lhort $ the left comparatively longer and taking a courfe from the kidney over the aorta J. Supra-renal veins.—-Thefe little veins are like the arteries in their courfe. The right one enters fome- * Vena Cava inferior. f Emulgent veins. f The Renal veins however fometimes vary in their number, the right being double or triple, the left even fometimes in four branches.

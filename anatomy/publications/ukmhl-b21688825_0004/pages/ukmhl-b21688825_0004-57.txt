OF THE -PERITONEUM. *5 The the adipofe membrane, on the infide .of the abdominal mufcles, and to the furface of the feveral vifcera ; its inner furface is fmooth, and forms no adhefion while the parts are found and healthy; its outer furface is loofer in its texture, and by the fplitting of its lamina it degenerates into the common cellular membrane. O The cellular membrane on the outfide of the peri- toneum is in fome places fhort, firm, and denfe; as on the liver, the fpleen, the uterus, and the inteftines : but it is longer, lax, and fatty, where it attaches the peritoneum to the mufcles and tendons of the abdo- men. The peritoneum has no termination ; or it is a fac; yet fo curicufly is it involved with the vifcera, that though we fay the vifcera are contained in the abdo- men, yet, accurately fpeaking, they are without the peritoneum, and confequently lie not in the abdominal cavity #. The peritoneum is expanded on the lower furface of the diaphragm; and at fome of the interdicts or perforations of that mufcle or its tendon it comes in contaft with the pleura, and adheres to it by cellular fubflance. From the diaphragm the peritoneum is re- flected off to the liver, forming the ligaments of that vifcus, and, expanded over its furface, it forms its outer membrane. From the diaphragm it is alfo fent off upon the oefophagus and ftomach, and prolonged to the fpleen on the left fide (as it is to the liver on the fight) fo as to form the ligaments of the fpleen. * See Hate I. and the explanation.

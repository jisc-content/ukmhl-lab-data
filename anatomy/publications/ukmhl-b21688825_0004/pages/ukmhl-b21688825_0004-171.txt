l39 OF THE KIDNEY. The veflels, and efpecially the arteries of the kidney, are very irregular in their number and form. Where they enter the body of the gland, they are accorm* panied with a capfule which continues with them to this final diftribution. Sometimes a folitary vefifel is feen making its exit by the convex furface of the kidney. We have had occafion to remark on the nerves of the kidnies and their connection with the coverings pf the tefticle, and to notice their effeCt in producing numbnefs of the thigh and retraction of the fcrotum in inflammation of the gland, when Hones lodge in the pelvis or ureter. Upon the fubjeCt of the fenfibility of the kidney, however, we mull be aware that difeafe, inflammation, fuppuration, nay even total wafting of the kidney may take place without any indication from pain. The excretory duCt of the kidney is called ureter : it leads from the kidney to the urinary bladder. When we trace it into the kidney it is found to enter the. naval-like fulcus of its concave fide ; here it is enlarged into a confiderable fac which is called the pelvis of the kidney. This is a kind of refervoir which, lying in the embrace of the folid and glandular part of the kidney, fends up feveral elongations almoft like the finger of a glove, which receive into them the papillae, the concentrated uriniferous tubes. Thefe procefles of the pelvis are called the colices or infundieuli. It may be obferved, however, that the term pelvis is taken from the greater dilatation of the ureter within , â€˜ the

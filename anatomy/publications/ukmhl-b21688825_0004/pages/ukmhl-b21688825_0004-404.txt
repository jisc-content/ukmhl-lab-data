352 APPENDIX. The great faphena may be traced from the great toe# from the infide of the foot, and behind the ancle: it receives one or two branches from the foie of the foot. Sometimes the principal branch palfes behind the lower head of the tibia, fometimes before it, or it forms circles here: a little above the ancle a vein from the middle of the metatarfal arch comes obliquely over the tendon of the tibialis anticus and joins it. The faphena, now a confiderable trunk, runs up the leg before the inner margin of the belly of the galtroc- nemius mufcle, and on the inner judge of the tibia. In thisicourfe it receives numerous cutaneous branches, and backward, over the belly of the mufcies, it forms in.- ofculations with the lelfer faphena. From the infide of the leg the trunk afcends on the infide of the knee, where it receives feveral branches, coming round the joint, and over the head of the tibia. Now palling fomewhat obliquely, it afcends upon the thigh, and, at the fame time, turns from the infide to the fore part of the thigh. In the thigh the great faphena receives many branches, and is not always a fingle vein: for fome- times the branches collecting form a fmall trunk,, run- ning collateral to the greater vein, and which joins it in the groin. In all this courfe the faphena vein is fu- perficial and lies imbedded in the cutaneous fat; with but a very flight and imperfect apponeurofis inclofmg it; while it is external to the proper fafcia of the leg and thigh. As it afcends upon the thigh, however, it does not dive fuddenly under the fafcia "f but is gradually enveloped and embraced by the con- denfed cellular membrane and fafcia. When

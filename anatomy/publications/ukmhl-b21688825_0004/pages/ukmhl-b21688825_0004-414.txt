APPENDIX. â€¢37* remains of the vafcular pulp, prefently to be defcribed, occupying the centre of the tooth, which being fupplied with nerves, gives the acute pain in tooth-ach. It is as a medium communicating or abftra&ing heat, that the tooth itfelf feems to give pain. When wrought upon by the dentift, no fenfation is produced unlefs the tremor be communicated to the jaw, or unlefs the abrading, or cutting inftruments, be fo plied as to heat the tooth; then an acute pain is produced from the heat communicated to the centre; and fo, extremely cold fubftances, or liquids, taken into the mouth, ftill pro- duce pain, from the cold affe&ing the pulp of the tooth. As living parts, the teeth have adhefion to the peri- ofteum, and are connected with their internal pulp; but when they fpoil, and are eroded, the difeafe fpreads inwardly, probably deftroying the life of the bony part of the tooth, the progrefs of which difeafe is marked by a change of colour penetrating beyond the caries towards the centre of the tooth. When this decoloura- tion has reached the internal furface, the pain of tooth- ach is excited, the pulp, vafcular and fupplied with nerves, inflames, from a want of accordance with the altered (late of the tooth, juft as the dead furface of a bone will inflame the central periofteum and marrow. The extreme pain produced by this (late of the tooth probably proceeds from the delicate and fenfible pulp fwelling in the confinement of the cavity of the tooth. In caries of the teeth, the body of the tooth is dif- covered deep in its fubftance long before the pulp of the central cavity is expoled by the progrefs of the caries. No exfoliation, or exoftofis, takes place upon that

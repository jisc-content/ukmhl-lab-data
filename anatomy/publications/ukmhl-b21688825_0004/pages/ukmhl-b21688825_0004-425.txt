OF THE TEETH. It will not adhere; it has become a dead part, and the living fubftance refufes to coalefce with it. Again, and in oppofition to this, is it not very extraordinary that the teeth may be burnt by chemical agents, or the adtual cautery, down to the centre, and yet retain their hold; or that the body of the tooth may be cut off, and a new tooth fixed into it by a pivot ? Had the teeth any vafcular a&ion, this torturing would caufe re-a£tion and difeafe in them. Sometimes the molt terrible effects are produced by thefe operations, as tetanus, abcefs in the jaws, &c.; but this happens in confequence of the central nerve being bruifed by the wedging of the pivot in the cavity of the tooth, or by the roots of the teeth becoming, as dead bodies, a fource of irritation to the furrounding fockets. The difeafe produced by the tranfplanting of teeth has not been fatisfaftorily explained, though the in- veftigation would throw confiderable light on the phyliology of the teeth, and be in itfelf of practical ufe. About a month after tranfplanting the tooth, and after it has taken perfect adhefion, the difeafe has appeared. An ulceration is perceived in the gum and jaw; or the gum fhrinking and wafting by ulceration, leaves the tooth and alveoli bare. Soon after, blotches appear on the Ikin ; and fometimes ulcers in the throat. —In fome cafes, this difeafe has been cured without mercury, and in others, feems only to have yielded to the mercureal courfe. Mr. Hunter entertained the opinion that it was not venereal, but a diftinct difeafe; and I find that Richter fuppofes there are two dif- eafes produced, the one venereal, and the other a C c 2 peculiar

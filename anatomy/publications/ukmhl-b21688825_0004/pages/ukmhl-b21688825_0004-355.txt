OF THE ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS. 313 it is natural, at firft fight, to fay, fince the one fide of the vertebra is of its natural depth, and the other diminifhed, that the fide which is deep has re- mained, but the other fide has been abforbed ; but, when we inquire a little deeper into the phenomenon, which has taken place, we recoiled: that the matter of bone is undergoing a perpetual change, and that the matter of both fides of the vertebra is changed j we fee that the preffure may not have excited the veffels to greater adion fo as to caufe abforption ; but that the preffure has prevented the depofiticn of new matter, when the old was taken away in the natural rotine of the fyftem. Mr. Hunter has afligned five caufes of abforption, which I conceive may be very naturally refolved into one.â€”Thefe are, i, parts being preffed $ 2, parts being irritated; 3, parts being weakened; 4, parts being rendered ufelefs ; 5, parts becoming dead : of the firft: we have already Ipoken ; the fecond I (hould deny, unlefs when, it refolves into the third; for irritation does not caufe abforption, unlefs when it is to an extent fufficient to del troy the natural adion and weaken the part. The third and fourth come under the effed of the lofs of the natural and accuftomed ftimulus to adion in the arterial fyftem, which of courfe gives a preponderance to the abforbents : of the fitth we can have nothing to add illuftrative of the living fyftem.

OF THE SPLEEN. *35 ment and controul of the organ; is active when the organ is excited ; is, relatively fpeaklng, quiefcent when that organ is not called by its fympathies to exercife its funftion. 3. An artery tortuous in its courfe has more mufcu- iarity and greater power of action than one which takes a (freight courfe; but in proportion to the increafe of power which it obtains by its increafe of length in this tortuous and bending courfe, will thefe turns retard and weaken the force of the heart upon the extreme ramifications of the veffel. Thus a tortuous artery is the means of increafing the velocity of the blood by its own aflion, but it makes the organ lefs dependent on the general force of the circulation. We accordingly find that in thofe organs where there is occafional activity alternating with a quiefcent ftate, the artery is tortuous; and where there is an increafe of force required in the circulation, there, the artery, from being {freight in its courfe, becomes crooked and twilled in every way *, From thefe remarks, we may be inclined to draw, from the tortuous figure of the fplenic artery, a condit- ion fomewhat different from that which has hitherto * This ha.s been fuppofed the effeft cf the impulfe of the blood, but nothing cun be more falfe. Let any one examine the artery of a limb when a great tumour is growing ; the artery will be found tortuous to fupply it. Again, in the aneurifmal varix where there is a breach in the artery, and the blood finds a freer return to the heart, the artery will be found enlarged and tortu- ous in order to fupply the lower part of the limb ; while there is a quantity of the blood withdrawn froip the circulation by the Sornmunicaiion with the vein.

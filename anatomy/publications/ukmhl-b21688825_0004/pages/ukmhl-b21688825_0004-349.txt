OF THE ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS. 3Â°7 X 4 laboured. logy between this and the deftrudtion of folid parts ? It has been faid that the abforbents eat down the folids, and nibble like the mouth of a worm ! a conjedture, the falfity of which is equal to its apparent abfurdity. The folids are raifed by the agency of the veflels on the chemical affinities of the circulating fluids. They mull be refolved by their decompofltion, reducing them again to the date of fluids; or the fecreting veflels throw out fluids which diflolve them: an operation anterior to their abforption. From the comparative fimplicity of the fluids of the circulating veflels, and that in the ab- forbents, we are authprized to conclude, that as from the blood the feveral fecretions, folids, and fluids are formed ; thefe fluids, before they are again taken into the adtive fyftem of veflels, are refolved into their origi- nal Ample and conftituent parts. Thus we are not to look for the matter of the component parts of the body in the abforbing fyflem of veflels more than in the blood, from which thefe parts were originally formed. Upon this fubjedt I conceive, that the abforption of the folids depends but in a limited degree on the agency of the lymphatics; and that there is a neceflary change in the aggregation of the matter previous to the abforp- tion by the mouths of the lymphatic veflels. EXAMINATION OF SOME OPINIONS OF MR. HUNTER. ON THE SUBJECT OF ABSORPTION OF SOLIDS. Mr. Hunter fays that his conception of the mat- ter is, that nature leaves little to chance ; and that the whole operation of abforption is performed by an action in the mouths of the abforbents.

OF THE PANCREAS, 128 fo we are led to conclude that the flow of pancreatic fluid may be as fuddenly produced without the nec'efli* ty of a refervoir, as in the biliary fyftein. We natu* rally conceive that the effect of this fluid is to diminifh the vifcidity of the bile, and by diluting it to mix it uniformly with the food. There are however few fads to enable us to reafon on the effeds of the pancreatic fluid. If we give full credit to the experiments of Malpighi and Brunner we may conclude, that when the pancreas is taken away, the more acrid bile caufes vomiting or voracious appetite by its flimulus. Schir- rus of the pancreas has been found attended with a coflive and flow motion of the inteflines; which feems to contradid the refult ofthefe expeiiments on animals; but by the fchirrofity and enlargement of the pancreas the biliary duds may have been more or lefs com- prefled, and the retarding of the ufual quantity of the biliary fecretion might produce the flownefs of the bowels *. â€¢ According to the hypothefis of Silvius, the ufe of the pan- creas was to fupply an acid fpirit or juice, and the biliary fecre- tion being of the nature of an alkali, thefe two ftruggling together caufed the reparation of the chyle from the fceces. This good fight did not flop here, but thele enemies being carried into the blood continued their warfare in the heart itfelf, and lighted up the vital flame there. Nay, if we believe the experiment of F. Schuyl, (de Veteri Med.) this hypothefis was not without its proofs; for having tied in the portion of the duodenum of a living dog, where the pancreatic and biliary ducts entev, he faw the ebulition from this Jtruggle of the acid and the alkali ; and when he comprefled the hepatic dudt, the tumifadiion of the intelline fubfided ; when he took off this comprefiion it was again blown up. As this experi- ment has not fucceeded fince, as Haller obferves, Schuyl was probably deceived by the perlflaltic motion of the inteflines.

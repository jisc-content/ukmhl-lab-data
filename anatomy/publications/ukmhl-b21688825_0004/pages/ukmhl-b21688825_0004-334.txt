292 OF THE CAPILLARY VESSELS. and other injections ; fecondly, in glands; thirdly, in cells receiving red blood ; fourthly, in lymphatic veins; fifthly, in exhalents, which pour their fluids into the cellular membrane, cavities, joints, &c. and which fluid is taken up by the valvular lymphatic abforbents. But thefe abforbent veflels, of which we are now to treat under the divifion of lymphatics, do alfo perform a circulation, in as much as they convey back to the centre of the fyftem the fluids, which have been thrown out from the extremities of the arteries. But as thefe lymphatic veflels are not continued from the extremities of the arteries as the red veins are, as they imbibe the fluids, which have been thrown out of the other fyftem ; their fluid contents cannot be conveyed through them by the force of the heart and arteries, they muft be peculiar in having powers with- in themfelves, firft of abforbing, and then of propel- ling their fluid onward to the heart. This common property of abforption in the lym- phatics, abforbents, and laCteals, and their being con- nected with the fame trunk, occafions their being con- iidered as one fyftem of veflels; when, in faCt, looking upon the general ceconomy of the living body, we find them miniftering to very different purpofes. The one branch of the fyftem, the lymphatics (as we have feen in the introduction to this volume), takes up the mat- ter which has been fecreted, and poured out from the arteries, (viz. all the folids and fluids of the body,) and conveys it again into the circulating fyftem. The laCltal veflels on the contrary, are thofe veflels which opening upon the inner furface of the inteftines re- ceive into them the nutritious fluids, prepared by the organs

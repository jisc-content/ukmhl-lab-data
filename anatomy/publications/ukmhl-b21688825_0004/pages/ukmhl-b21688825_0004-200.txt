l68 STRUCTURE OF THE PENIS. comprefies the bulb, and in confequence the whole ipongy body to the extremity of the glans is made tenfe, elongates, and contra&s the diameter of the urethra, adapting it to the emiflion of femen. Mr. Home, I obferve, fuppofes “ that an a&ion takes “ place in the membrane of the urethra during copu- w lation, to reduce the fixe of the canal, and fit it for “ throwing out the femen with the neceflary vdo- i( city but for this, there feems no ground nor proof; and I imagine, the action of the accelerator, and the date of diftention of the fpongy body, will be a good fubflitute to his conjecture. The obtufe point of the glans is. fpread upon the extremities of the cavernous bodies of the penis, which yet have no communication with-the glans. We ob- ferve a circular margin, the corona glandis, and be- hind this the cervix. About the corona and cer- vix there are many little glandular folicules which are no doubt for preferving the mobility of the pre- putium. The preputium is a loofe prolongation of the in- teguments of the penis, which hangs over and de- fends the delicate and fenfible furface of the glans. Its inner furface is of courfe the continued furface of the common integuments, while it again is reflected over the glans. Upon the lower fide the preputium is tied in, a particular manner to the furface of the glans behind the orifice of the urethra. This connexion li- mits the motion of the preputium, and is called fre- n'um PREPUTII. * Gian dub odorif. of Tyfon. See Morgagni. The £

That thefe plies are formed chiefly by the laxity of the connection and the greater rela- tive extent of the inner coat, is apparent upon inverting â–  the gut, and infinuating a blow-pipe under it, for then you may diflend the cellular fubftance of the vafcular coat fo as entirely to do away the valvulse conniventes. The pile or lanuginous furface from which this coat has its name, is to be feen only by a very narrow in- fpection, or with the magnifying glafs. It is owing to innumerable fmall filaments which projeCl from the furface, like hairs at firft view, but of a flat or rounded figure as the date of fulnefs and excitement or deple- tion fliows them. They confifl: (as appears by the microfcope) of an artery and vein, and laCfeal or ab- forbing vefiels, and to thefe we may furely add the ex- tremity of the nerve.

363 APPENDIX. When It was more the pra&ice than at prefent to bleed in the ancle, the faphena major was the vein fe- lefted: but as in all the courfe of the vein, from the great toe to the knee, it is connefled with the nerve which bears its name, there are not wanting inftances of * thofebad effects from pricking of the nerve, which not unfrequently follow the bleeding in the arm. Saphena minor*. This vein arifes from the plexus on the outfide of the dorfum pedis : it runs over the cuter ancle and above the fafcia, covering the tendons of the peronei mufcles. Here receiving many branches and forming frequent deep inofculations, it mounts on the outfide of the vagina or fafcia, which covers the back of the leg, until arriving betwixt the hamfiring tendons it finks into the popliteal hollow, terminating in the popliteal vein. The other veins of the lower extremity which ac- company the arteries in their courfe, need little defcrip- tion. Anterior tibial vein.—The veins accompanying the anterior tibial artery form many inofculations, and when minutely inje&ed, almofl conceal the artery. They are the anterior tibial veins and only unite into a trunk, where perforating the interoffeous ligament it joins the popliteal vein. Posterior tibial vein.—In the foie of the foot we have the external and internal plantar veins, which uniting into trunks, accompany the artery be- hind the inner ancle. In its courfe betwixt the foleus and the tibialis amicus mufcles, it cannot be called the * Vena faphena parva, externa. poflerior

^3o of the Womb. the os ttncbj, or orifice formed of the bulging lipS* which project into the vagina, of courfe that part ovet which the inner membrane of the vagina is refleded. We diftinguifh alfo the two furfaces, for the womb is of a flattened form. The anterior furface of the body of the womb is convex, but the pofterior furface is conflderably more fo, and even during geflation it keeps this relative figure. The whole fize of the uterus is about three inches irl length, and two in breadth, but there is a very great variety in this refped, from age, the effed of preg- nancies, and other caufes. When, in its ufual fitua* tion and relations, the fundus is on a level with the brim of the pelvis, or a very little below, it. In the fetus, the womb is like the bladder, conflderably above the brim of the pelvis; but, in a few weeks the pelvis enlarging, it finks deeper, and foon aflfumes the fame fituation as in the adult.1 Falopean tubes. From the lateral obtufe angles formed betwixt the fundus and the body of the uterus* the Falopean tubes are continued. Thefe tubes may i almofl be confldered as a continuation of the bterus, did not we And them fo very diftind in their fubftance. They are about three inches in length, take a tortuous courfe, and their extremities have an unequal fringed termination, which is called the fimbriae*. Their canal is very Anall towards the titerus, but enlarges, and is patulous towards the extremities. Thefe canals are the communications by which the ovum formed in the ovarium is carried down into the womb. * Morfus diaboli. Liga-

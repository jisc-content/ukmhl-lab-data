320 OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. As in general there are two great veins on the fore arm, the bafilic and cephalic veins; but particularly a3 the veins which gather into the balilic trunk, on the inner and lower edge of the fore-arm, are the larger and more numerous clafs; fo it is found that the courfe of the more numerous clafs of lymphatics is on the lower and inner fide of the fore arm, and that they accumulate about the bafilic vein. Thefe are derived from the palm of the hand, and from the ulnar edge of the hand. This fet fometimes paffes into glands, feated on the brachial artery, near the inner condyle of the humerus. The abforbents which accompany the cephalic vein, arife from the fides of the thumb and fore finger upon the back of the hand ; they run on the radial edge of the arm, with the veins which afcend to form the cephalic vein. From the bend of the arm thefe veffels take a courfe on the outer edge of the biceps, and then get betwixt the inner edge of the deltoid, and outer edge of the pedtoral mufcles ; they then pafs under the clavicle, and defcend into the axillary glands. This fet of abforbents receive the branches from the outfide of the arm in their whole courfe. There are abforbents arifing from the back of the hand, next the little finger, which following fome of the branches of the bafilic vein (a larger branch of which is called the ulnaris externa) turn round the ulnar edge of the arm, are inferted into a gland, very commonly found before and a little above the inner condyle of the humerus. From this gland a large lymphatic paffes upwards, and attaching itfelf to the brachial artery, fplits and plays around it. The

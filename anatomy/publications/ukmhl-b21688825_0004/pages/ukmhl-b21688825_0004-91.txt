When pure, it is a pellucid, mucilaginous liquor, a little fait and brackilh to the tafte like moll other fecretions, and having the power of retarding putrefaction and dif- folving the food. It afts on thofe fubftances which are nutritious to the animal, and which are peculiarly adapred to its habits. It has, confequently, fome va- riety of properties in different animals. The fecreting powers of the ftomach feem fo far to accommodate ihemfelves to the food received into it, that the pro- perty of the gaftric fluid is altered according to the nature of the food. This affords another argument in favour of a Ample diet; fince, in a variety of con- diments received promifeuoufly into the ftomach, the chance is the greater of fome ingredient becoming an offenfive load. It feems to be a peculiarity in the human ftomach, that it has a greater capacity for digefting a variety of animal and vegetable bodies. But I Ihould at the fame time con- ceive that the natural power of digefting the Ample and appropriate food is diminilhed as the ftomach gains the power of difl'olving a variety of fubftances. In other creatures, a fudden change of food is reje&ed, and the powers of the ftomach are found incapable of acting duly on the aliment, though time fo far accommodates the gaftric fluid to the ingefta that the animalization becomes perfect.

OF THE WOMB. with the feminal fluid from the tefticle of the male (and which, in all probability, is the production of flagnation and putridity), to fwim and be nourifhed in the male femen, and yet to hold that on being intro- duced into the â€˜ovaria, it changes from an aCtive ani- mal into an impalpable gelatinous-like mafs,and, after a feries of changes, grows at lafl to the maturity of a human being, is altogether beyond my compre- henfion. The experiments made by the ingenious Dr. Heigh- ton, throw confiderable light upon thefe delufive fpe- culations regarding the impregnation of the female. He found ry experiments on rabbits, that upon cutting the Falopean tubes, forty-eight hours after the coitus, the impregnation was equally obftructed as when he had cut them previous to admitting the male ; it would appear that in thefe animals impregnation is by no means the inftantaneous effeCt of the union of the male and female, but that it requires at lead: fifty hours; for, when Dr. Heighten cut the Falopean tubes at that period, it did not prevent impregnation. Dr. Heigh- ton proves, that the generative procefs is not an in- ftantaneous effect, as we fhould very naturally fuppofe, but an operation requiring time. That the femen does not reach the ovaria during, or immediately after the coitus, is fufficiently evident; and it is ftill more fo, that the ovum is impregnated while in the ovari- um, and not upon its defeent into the womb, which is proved from the foetus fometimes remaining in the ovarium, or tubes, and growing to maturity. Dr. fieighton fuppofes the femen only to affeCl the vagina and uterus, and that a confent of parts, or fympathy, k

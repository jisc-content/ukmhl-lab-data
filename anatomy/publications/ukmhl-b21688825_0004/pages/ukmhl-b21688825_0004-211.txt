This furrounding of the body of the tefticle by the peritoneum forms that coat which is in union vvi'th its ftlbftance, and which defcends with it into the fcrotUm, and forms the tunica al- buginea. The figure ami prefenting furfaces of the tefticle, while within the belly, are the fame which we find after it has defcended into the fcrotum. It ftands edge-ways forward, and the epididimis lies along the outfide of the pofterior edge of the teftes. We fee that it is attached, by the peritoneum being reflecled off from its back part, and we can trace the perito- neum upwards over the kidney G, and downward over the reCtum F, and bladder of urine E. We may alfo obferve a procefs of the peritoneum which has pafied through the abdominal ring, and which in this plan is marked D. Now it may eafily be underftood that the tefticle A, gradually ftlifting its place .from its connections in the loins, drops down into this {heath D. It will alfo be eafily under- ftood how the tefticle covered with its firft coat B, (viz. the tunica albuginea,) when it has fallen into D, is invefted by this fac of the peritoneum, and that this laft covering will come to be the tunica vaginalis. The tunica vap-â€™malis is fo called becaufe it covers* the tefticle like a fheath ; that is, it does not univerfally adhere to the furface of the albuginea, as that coat does to the body of the tefticle.

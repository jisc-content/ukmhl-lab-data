It confifts of two membranes, or is as a fac collapfed and hanging from the Itomach and colon f, one of the Tides being the peritoneum reflected off from the eefo~ phagus and alongft all the great arch of the ftomach, and the other that which comes from the arch of the colon. And further, as each of thefe lamina may be fup- pofed to confift of two lamina ; for example, where the omentum is formed by the meeting of the peritoneum from the lower and upper furfaces of the ftomach; thefe two, meeting, form the upper lamina: and as, where the lower layer of the omentum comes off from the colon, it is alfo formed by the peritoneum reflected in the fame manner; fo with fome truth the omentum * Praeterea tenerrimas effe ut nulla membranarum humana- t?uin, retina oculi excepta, asque fit tenera.

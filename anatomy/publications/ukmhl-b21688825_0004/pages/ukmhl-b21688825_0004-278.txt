OF THE WOMB. 236 The The spermatic arteries come down from the aorta itfelf, or from the renal or capfular arteries. The fpermatic artery taking a waving direction, be- comes tortuous/ in a mod remarkable degree as it ap- proaches the uterus, it is diftributed to the Falopean tube, the ovarium, but chiefly to the body and fundus of the uterus, where it forms remarkable anaftamofes with the artery of the other fide. The LOWER ARTERY the UTERINE ARTERY, comes in general from the hypogaftric artery, takes alfo a ferpentine courfe, and is diftributed to the va- gina, and the lower part of the uterus, and inofculates largely with the other veflels, both in the uterus, and by particular branches on the fide of the uterus. In the firft place, it appears, that this copious fup- ply of veflels to the uterus, from four different fources, is a provifion that the womb and fecundines fliall not by any accident of pofition, or by the progrefs of la- bour, and the confequent compreflion of one or both the lower veflels, be deprived of their due fupply of blood. Again, their tortuous forms give proof of their occafional greater activity, that they admit of a peculiar and local a&ion during menftruation, and that the blood will move more languidly when the ftimulus of the womb has ceafed. It is alfo a provifion for the growth and increafe of the womb, and the fupply of nourifhment to the ovum. And that an in- creafed a&ivity in a part muff be fupplied by a more tortuous form, as well as an enlargement of the calibre of the veflels, is in a particular manner illuftrated by the change which takes place in thefe veflels during pregnancy. For they become in a much more remark- able degree tortuous and enlarged.

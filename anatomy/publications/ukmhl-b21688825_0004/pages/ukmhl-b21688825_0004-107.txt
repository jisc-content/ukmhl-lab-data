75 OF T HE SMALL INTEST1NE.S. tudinal fibres. Indeed, when the fvftem has been ex- haufted by a long and debilitating illnefs with fcarcely any excitement of the inteflinal canal, thefe fibres are not to be obferved. In a man who has been cut fud- denly off by difeafe, or who has died a violent death, they become more demonftrable ; and in difeafes where there has been congeftion and excited adtion in the inteftines, they are of courfe ftill fironger and more difcernible. The internal ftratum of the mufcular fibres is much fironger and more eafily demonftrated. Thefe fibres will be obferved much fironger about the duodenum and upper part of the jejunum, but they become weaker and more pellucid towards the extre- mity of the ileon. Tracing any particular fibre of the circular ftratum, it is found to form only a fegment of a circle, a part of the circuti of the inteftine. It feems loft amongft neighbouring fibres or cellular connec- tions ; but ftill, taken together, the circular mufcular fibres uniformly furround the whole gut *. To account for that adtion of the inteftines which urges on the food, we may fuppofe a greater degree of irritability and a&ivity to refide in the upper portion, where of courfe is commenced that adtion which is fuccefiively propagated downward, carrying the faces into the lower part of the canal. Some anatomifts have ingenioufly imagined that the inner ftratum of fibres furrounds the inteftine not in a circular diredlion, as was aflerted by Willis, but obliquely and in a fpiral courfe; from which followed a fimple explanation of * Morgagni Advcrfaria Anatomica III.

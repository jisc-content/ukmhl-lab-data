In another experiment, leaving the arteries and veins of the mefentery free, and the circu- lation through them perfect; ftill no white fluid could be difcovered, tinging the ftream of blood in the veins. Neither did preflure upon the gut, in any inftance force the fluid of the inteftines into the veins. — He repeated and varied thefe experiments, fo as to (how in a very fatisfaftory manner, that chyle, or the fluid of the inteftines, never is absorbed by the veins. Yet I muft fay that thefe experiments .are ftill unfatisfaftory, as they regard the general dodtrine of abforption by the veins: in the inteftines there Is a peculiar fet of veflels evidently deftined to the abforp- tion of the chyle and of the fluids of the cavity ; but there remains a queftion which will not be eafily deter- mined : do not the veins throughout the body refume a part of that fubftance, or of thofe qualities, which are depoftted or bellowed by the arteries ?—We are aflured that in the circulation of the blood through the lungs, and in the extremities of the pulmonic veins, there is an imbibing or abforption : and in the veins of the placenta, there is not only an abforption fimilar to what takes place in the extreme branches of the pulmonic circulation, but the matter and fubftance which goes to the nourifhment of the foetus, is imbibed from the maternal circulation *. So by the veflels in the mem- brane of the chick in ovo, there is abforbed that * Dr. Hunter, Hewfcn, See, fay that it Is probable there are many fmall lymphatics in the placenta, which open into the branches of the veins, and do not take -a courie along the cord. This is very improbable, and has no fupport from analogy. which

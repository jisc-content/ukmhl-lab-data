We fhall prefently find, that the fubferviency of menftruation merely to the preparation of the fur- face of the womb for the reception of the fetus, though it be a principal, is by no means the foie end of this periodical difcharge. It was long difputed from what fource the menflrual difcharge flowed. Some affirmed, that it mull flow from the vagina, and not from the womb, becaufe it flowed fometimes during geflation.

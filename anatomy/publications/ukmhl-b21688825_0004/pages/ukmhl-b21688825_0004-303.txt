In the early months it is much flronger than the amnios, but in the advanced ftage it has come in contaft with the amnios, no fluid being betwixt them. And in proportion as the amnios gains ftrength to be of eflential fervice in dilating the orifice of the womb during labour, the chorion has relatively be- come very thin and weak.

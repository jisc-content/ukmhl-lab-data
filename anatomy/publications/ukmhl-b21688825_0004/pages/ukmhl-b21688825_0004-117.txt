It is natural to fup- pofe that aS the contents of the inteftines become in their defcent more acrid and ftiinulating, there will be a more copious fecretion of mucus in the lower intef* tines for the defence of the villous coat* SECTION IV. OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. The great inteftines form that part of the inteflinal canal which is betwixt the extremity of the ileon and the anus. They differ elfentially from the finall intef- tines in their lize, form, and general character; and in the texture, or at leafc in the thicknefs of their coats. The great inteftine, beginning on the right fide of the belly, rifes before the kidney ; pafifes acrofs the upper part of the belly, under the liver, and before or under the ftomach *. Then making a hidden angle from under the ftomach and fpleen j-, it defcends into the left iieac region. Here, making a remarkable turn and convolution, it defcends into the pelvis by a curve running in the hollow of the lacrum. The great inteftines are accounted to be about feven feet in length, and to bear a relation to the finall intef- tines as five to twenty-five. * This turn of the colon from the right nc.rofs the belly is flexura prima, fuperior dextra hipatica Soemmering. f Flexura fecuada, fuperior finiftra Jienaiis.

OF THE WOMB. <174 perform an aft ion fimilar to that of the pulmonary veflels of the adult, feeing that they carry out dark- coloured blood, and convey it back to the chick, of a bright vermilion colour. Now, I do not conceive, that this change upon the blood is performed by the communication with the atmofphere through the ihell, for I fee no diftindfion in the colour of the veflels, which are contiguous to the membrane of the fnell, and thofe which are removed from it by tire expand- ing of the air-cell. Further we find, that there is an intermediate kind of generation in fifhes which are oviparous, but retain the egg within their womb, until the fetus is matured ; here no communication with the ail or w'ater can be allowed. Since we fee that the chick in ovo is capable of mi- niftering in every eflential particular to its own increafe, wherefore fhould w?e fuppofe that the fetus of vivipa- rous animals has any other more particular connexion , with the womb of the mother ?â€”-The difference is in my mind this fimply; the ovum of the oviparous animals defending through the convoluted and inteftinal-like womb of the hen, accumulates a quantity of matter around it, which ferves every purpofe of nutrition when the embrio ffiall be finally feparated from the maternal fyftem ; but in the viviparous animals the ovum defending into the womb remains there, and has an inceflant fupply of nutritious fluid, fecreted from the veflels of the womb, as it is required by the appetency of the fetal fyftem. As in the egg, the membranes furrounding the white have the fame effedt upon the blood, which is afterwards produced by the lungs; fo has the placenta of viviparous animals the double

*3^ OF THE KIDNEY. upon the mufcles of the loins, the peritoneum is merely ftretched over it. This is the reafon why calculi in the kidney have wrought themfelves out by fiflulse in the loins; and it is the ground of the hazardous propofal of cutting into the kidney to extract calculi. The adipofe membrane furrounds the kidney, and forms a perfect capfule ; for it is this which is fometimes in an extraordinary degree loaded with accumulated fat. Upon this capfule the caecum is attached on the right fide, the colon on the left, and betwixt the kidnies and the mteftines there is a ftrift fympathy, which is ap? parent in the nephretic colic; The figure of the kidney is that of an oval bent, or a little incurvated, fo as to form a fulcus or general con- cavity to one fide, while the other takes a greater con- vexity. By the concave furface of the kidney, which is towards the fpine and great veffels, the arteries and veins and ureter pafs in by the finus round which the fubftance or glandular body of the kidney terminates abruptly. The abdominal aorta and the vena cava lying clofe on the fpine and near to each other, give off laterally the emulgent arteries and veins. The renal or emul- gent artery comes from the fide of the aorta betwixt the upper and the lower mefenteric arteries: that of the left kidney has its origin a little higher than the right: and the aorta being on the left and the cava towards the right fide of the fpine, the left emulgent artery is fhorter than the vein ; the artery longer than the vein on the right fide. Again, the aorta being more plofely attached to the fpine, the emulgent vein %s rather above the artery. The

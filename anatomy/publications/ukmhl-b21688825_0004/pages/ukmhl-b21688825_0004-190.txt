15$ OF THÂ£ BLADDER OF URINE. The peritoneal coat of the bladder does nof furround the bladder, but only covers the fundus and back part. It. is like in every refpeCt to the peritoneal coat of the abdominal vifcera; fmooth without ; and adhering to the inner coat by cellular membrane; which cellular membrane is, however, of a loofer texture, and in greater quantity than in the abdominal vifcera. This peritoneal coat is no doubt of much fervice as a divifion in obftruCting the courfe of inflammation arif- ing from the difeafes in the lower part of the pelvis, or from operations performed on the bladder, reCtum, or peroneum ; were it not for the loofe peritoneum fpread- ing over the cellular texture of the pelvis, we could neither be fo bold or fo fuccefsful in our operations here. That portion of the peritoneum which covers the back part of the bladder, forms a particular tranf* verfe fold when the bladder is contracted. This fold furrounds the pofterior half of the bladder, and its two extremities are ftretched towards the fide of the pelvis, fo as to form a kind of lateral ligament. Though in the contracted or moderately diftended ftate of the bladder, the peritoneum ftretches from the back of the os pubis to the bladder, the diftention of fhe bladder, in an immoderate degree, raifes the peri- toneum off from the pubes, fo that the bladder can be {truck with a trochar, or lithotomy performed above the pubes, by an inciflon direCtly into the bladder, with- out piercing the outer or peritoneal coat. Towards the lower part, the bladder, as we have feen, is inverted only by cellular membrane, which takes the place of the peritoneal coat of the fundus. While we are aware of the effeCt of the peritoneum, ftretched

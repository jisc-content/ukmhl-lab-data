OF THE LIVER. 97 healthy adult fubjedt the liver does not extend from under the margin of the ribs, unlefs near the pit of the flomach, but in the foetus and child it is much other- wife. In a foetus of the third and fourth month the liver almofl fills the belly; it reaches to the navel, covers the flomach, and is in contact with the fpleen. After the feventh month other parts grow with a greater ra- pidity in proportion. Indeed fome have affirmed,that the liver, or at leafl the left lobe, actually decreafes to- wards the time of birth *. But from this time to the advance to manhood the chefl becomes deeper; the fternum is prolonged 5 and the diaphragm becomes more concave; fo that the liver retires under the mar- gin of the ribs, and its margin on the left fide in the adult reaches no farther than to the oefophagus; When however the liver becomes fchirrous and en- larged, its hard margin comes down fo as to be felt through the abdominal paries under the border of the chefl. This enlargement of the liver, and confequent defcent of its margin* is to be felt more eafily by grafping the integuments of the belly, as if you expedit- ed to lift up the acute edge of the liver, than by preffing with the point c?f the finger. By this means we (hall be fenfible of the elafiicity and foftnefs below the liver, and of the refiltance and firmnefs of the mar- gin of it. The phyfician, however, fhould not forget* that the depreffion of the diaphragm, and confequent protrufion of the liver by difeafe in the thorax, gives the feeling of an enlargement and hardening of the liver. The left great divifion of the liver is perhaps as * M. Portal. Acad, de Sciences, 1773. VoL. IV. H often

164 OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. It has been faid, that there is really no divifion of this gland into lobes : but perhaps the belt authority on this queftion is difeafe. Now it happens fome- times that only one fide of the gland is enlarged, which is a proof that there is fome divifion betwixt the lobes. This unequal fwelling of the gland diftorts the urethra, and gives it a direftion very difficult to be fol- lowed by the catheter.

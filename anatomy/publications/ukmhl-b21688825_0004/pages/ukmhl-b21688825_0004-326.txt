Thefe tubercles are, however, furrounded by a zone or difk, of a brownidr red colour, the areola. At puberty, as we have faid, the bread of the female becomes protuberant, and thofe parts which were in miniature, and without action, quickly grow into a firm glandular mafs (fpeaking anatomically). The fhape, rotundity and firmnefs of the gland depends much upon the adipofe membrane furrounding and interfeCting the glandular body. The glandular part itfelf is divided into little mafles, which again confid of fmall granules. Thefe feveral fubdivifions of the glands are clofely furrounded by membranes. The lactiferous duCts are gathered together from thefe lefler granules, and unite into 12 or 15 in num- ber of a very confiderable dze, as they converge to- wards the root of the nipple. When milk is fecreted, the glands are large, a remarkable didention of the duCts alfo takes place, for they are then become tor* tuous and varicofe, and ferve as refervoirs of the milk.

OF THE TEETH. 377 The pulp, or vafcular papilla on which the tooth is formed, has not only this peculiar property of oilifica- tion, but, as the period of revolution advances, where it forms the rudiments of the molares for â€˜example, its bafe fplits fo as to form the mould of two, three, or four fangs, or roots; for around thefe divifions of the pulp the oflific matter is thrown out fo as to form a tube continued downward from the body of the tooth. Gradually, and by fucceffive layers of matter on the infide of this tube, it becomes a ftrong root, or fang, and the bony matter has fo encroached on the cavity, that only a fmall canal remains, and the appearance of the pulp is quite altered, having fhiunk in this narrow fpace. We have faid that the tooth forming on its pulp, or vafcular bed, is furrounded with a membrane giving the whole the appearance of a little fac. This mem- brane has alfo an important ufe. It is vafcular alfo as the pulp is, but it is more connected with the gums, and receives its veffels from the furface, while the pulp, lying under the fhell of the tooth, receives its blood- veffels from that branch of the interna! maxillary artery which takes its courfe in the jaw. The enamel is formed after the body of the tooth has confiderably advanced towards its perfect form. It is formed by a fecretion from the capfule, or membrane, which inverts the teeth *, and which is originally con- tinuous with the pulp. The enamel is thicker at the point, and on the body of the tooth, than at its neck. Mr. Hunter fuppofed that the capfule always fecreting, * This outer fac has been called chorion, fiom the numerous vefiels diftributed upon it. See Kerilfant. 2 and

( 272 OF THE WOMB. ©fculate freely with each other, and the fluid paffes from the arteries to the veins with little extravasations or efcape of fluid, and fuch only as may be fuppofed to pafs from torn veflels. Again, the bleeding of the child does not draw from the maternal fyftem; for ex- ample, when the accoucheur has to perform the 6pera- tion of embrioulcia, and when the arteries of the brain pour out their blood, the woman does not fuffer, nor is there any danger of hremorrhagy from the cord after the delivery of the child. Again, what does the ana- logy of other animals fliow us ? We may obferve, in the firfl: place, that probably on account of the pecu- liar form of the womb of woman, and in thefe cir- cumftances to guard her from danger of hsemorrhagy during delivery, it is necefiary that the placenta fhould be accumulated towards the fundus of the womb- Now, to allow lefs danger of the feparation of the fe- cundines from the womb, and confequent abortion, there follows a neceflity for the human placenta being attached in a particular manner’; and in place of the maternal part of the placenta remaining with the womb, as in other animals, the whole mafs feparates on the delivery of the child. The neceflity for this firmer attachment of the human placenta, caufes the connection betwixt the foetal and the maternal por- tions to be very intimate, and the manner of the vafcular connection by no means eaflly demonflrated. In other animals, however, for example in thofe which have the fmall and numerous placenta, or coly- lidones, the foetal and maternal portions of the pla- centa feparate eaflly ; the maternal part being a pro- minent vafcular bed, which is a part of the womb, / and

237 OF THE WOMB. The fubftance of the uterus is faid to be fpongy and compact, which, though it is a feeming contradiction in words, does yet really convey an idea of the effects of its copious intertexture of veflels. Some have faid, (as Moriceau,) that by pregnancy the womb is diftend- ed, and grows thinner : others, that it grows thicker, as Daventer: and others again, as Smellie, aflert, that it continues of its natural thicknefs. Thefe afler- tions are noire of them perfectly correCt : for the womb is not diftended by the growth or the foetus and membranes, but grows with them. Again, that the fubftance of the womb grows in a remarkable de- gree, is true, but (till when diftended by the waters in t'ne laft months of pregnancy, its walls are thinner than in the unimpregnated ftate. Thus, v/hen it has been cut in the living body, upon the approach of labour, in the Caefarean feftion, I have obferved it, not more than a quarter of an inch in thicknefs, even at the part to which the placenta adhered. When I have difleCted the womb after a tedious labour, the waters d'ifcharged, but the head wedged in the pelvis, I have found it confiderably thicker. And, laftly, in the full contraction of the womb, after expelling the foetus and placenta, (for example, in rupture of the womb, where the child and placenta had been forced amongft the bowels, and the woman foon after died,) I found the walls of the womb about three quarters of an inch in thicknefs.

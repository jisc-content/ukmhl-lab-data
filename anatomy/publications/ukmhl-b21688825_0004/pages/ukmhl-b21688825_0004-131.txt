99 OF THE LIVER, LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVER. The peritoneum is refle&ed in fuch a manner from the neighbouring parts upon the liver as to form mem- branes receiving the name of ligaments. It has been explained, however, that thefe are not the foie fupport of this vifcus; and that the compreffion of the fur- rounding abdominal mufcles is the principal fupport of the liver, as it is of the other vifcera. The broad ligament* of the liver is formed by two lamina of the peritoneum, connedled by their cellular membrane, defending from the middle of the dia- phragm and point of the fternum to the convex upper -* furface or dorfumf of the liver. This ligament is broadeft where it pafles down from the point of the fternum to the fofTa umbilicalis; but as it retreats back- ward it becomes narrower, and is united to the coro- nary ligament near the pafiage of the vena cava. This circumftance, with the curve which it naturally takes on the furface of the liver, gives it the lhape of the falx, as it is formed by the dura mater. ligamentum teres. The round ligament of the liver is the firmer ligamentous-like cord, which may be traced from the umbilicus along the peritoneum into the duplication of the broad ligament, and into the folia umbilicalis. It is formed by the degenerated coats of the great vein which brings the florid blood from {he placenta into the veins of the liver, and from * Ligamentum latum fufpenforium, falciforme. f See Plate I. of this volume.

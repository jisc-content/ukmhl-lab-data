Of the placenta, and of the nutrition of THE FCETUS. When the ovum firft defcends into the uterus, the fleecy furface of the chorion eftablilhes a univerfal ad- hefion, but no fooner is the attachment of the ovum eftablilhed, than the veffels of the fcetus which arer univerfally diftributed over its furface, begin to accu- mulate to that point from which the more abundant fupply is obtained. Thus, from the univerfal adhe-- flon the veffels of the fcetus are maffed and accu- mulated together, fo as to form a thick cake or pla- centa.

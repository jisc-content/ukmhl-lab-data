262 O? THE WOMB. Now we perceive that the fcetal fyftem which de- fcends from the ovarium, is not merely a foetus or embryo, but that this embryo, befides a fyftem of veffels within its own body, is furrounded completely with membranes, and that from the vafcular fyftem of the embryo, there go out veffels, which being minutely diftributed to the outer veficle, or membrane, and actuated by the fame heart which circulates the blood through it, our little corporal fyftem prepares for imbibing the due nourifhment from the uterus. Vesicula alba. The veficula alba, or umbilicalis, is a little veficle which lies betwixt the chorion and amnion; it contains a white fluid; it is conne&ed with the naval or cord, by an artery and vein. Very little has been offered as explanatory of its ufe, it has been confidered as fimilar to the alantois of quadru- peds, and having a connection with the urachus; but It has no communication with the bladder, and foon difappears. Whereas, if it had been for receiving the fecretion of urine, it would have been prepared for the more mature ftate of the fqgtus. I conceive it not to be improbable, that it is a provifion of fupply for the embryo, previous to its perfect attach- ment to the uterine fyftem, and during its defcent into the womb, perhaps fimilar to the albumen of ovipa- rous animals, but which, after the perfeCt eftablifh- ment of the connection betwixt the foetal and maternal fyftem, fhrinks and difappears, as being no longer jieceffary.

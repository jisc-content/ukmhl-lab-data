OF THE STOMACH. 6c the cattle eating and digefting their fecundines *. I have known a cow die from this ; the membranes being found coiled up within the bowels. But the faft is fufhaently afcertained, that the nature of the digeftive procefs may be fo far altered that gratnenivorous ani- mals may be made to eat flelh, and carnivorous animals brought to live upon vegetables. This fact throws us back from the fimple idea which we fhould be apt to entertain of the nature of the change produced by digeftion, viz. that it is hmply chemical. For we fee that the nature of the folvent thrown out from the ftomach, and its chemical properties, may be changed by an alteration in the action of the coats of the lto- jnach. Thus we are baffled in our inquiries, and brought back to the confideration of this living pro- perty, which can fo accommodate itfelf to the nature of the aliment. The gaftric fluid has been collected from the fto- macbs of animals after death, by fponges which the animal has been made to fwallow, or which have been thruft down into its ftomach, incafed in perforated tubes. And, laftly, it has been obtained by exciting the-animal to vomiting, when the ftomach was empty ; for the fecretions of the ftomach are then poured out unmixed • with food f. Although by thefe means a Said may be obtained which may properly be called the fuccus gaftricus, yet it mull contain a mixture of the faliva, and fecretions from the glands of the cefo- phagus and pharynx, with the glandular fecretions of the ftomach, and the general vafcular fecretion from * See Obfervations on Digeftion. ■f By Spallanzani.

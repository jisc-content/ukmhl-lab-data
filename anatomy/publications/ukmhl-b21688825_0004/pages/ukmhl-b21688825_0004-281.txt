OF THE WOMB. 239 OF R 2 tinged; one or two loaded with injection; and fome vafcular, and particularly prominent. In very young girls, the fubftance of the ovarium is whitilh, and very foft; ,the furrounding membrane is thick ; and the round corpufcles fcarcely dilcernable; and no irregularities, nor any of thofe bodies called corpora lutea, are to be feen on the furface. But as the girl advances in years, the little vehicles begin1 to appear, and when about ten years of age, or juft be- fore menftruation, the ovarium is full of ova of vari- ous ftzes, and fome of them more matured, and form- ing an eminence upon the furface. In the adult wo- man, the fubftance of the ovarium, which appeared as an uniform homogeneous mafs in the foetus, is be- come a cellular and vafcular bed, giving nourifhment to thofe numerous veffels or ova. Before impregna- tion can take place, there muft be a certain ftate of preparation of the ovaria, without which the approach of the male effeds no change in the uterine fyftem. The lower animals having their feafons, and thefe fea- fons being a ftate of preparation for the male, impreg- nation follows the copulation with much certainty: but, in woman, fuch a periodical revolution in their fyftem, and inftindive defires, would but ill accord with that fuperiorty in attributes of the mind, which diftinguifti us in the fcale of beings. But women alfo. fuffer fuch an occaftonal excitement in the uterine fyftem, though unaccompanied with defires, which preferves the womb in a ftate of preparation for the re- ception of the ovum, and the ovaria in a ftate of pre- paration for impregnation. This is the effed of men- ftruation.

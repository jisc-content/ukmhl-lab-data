OF THE WOMB. 279 from its enlargement, and the difficulty with which the fundus makes it way among the vifcera in the brim of the pelvis. Having defcended condderably, the os tincse projects further into the vagina, but the fundus continuing to enlarge, at lad emerges from the circle of the bones, and then from the conical form of the ute- rus, it fometimes rifes fuddenly out of the pelvis; now the vagina will be found elongated, and the os tines: removed from the point of the finger. Now the ligaments of the womb direCt it forward, and it rifes clofe upon the abdominal paries, and before the bowels ; in the fird pregnancy it rifes almod direCtly up ; in fubfequent pregnancies from the greater relaxa- tion of the integuments and the abdominal mufcles, it is allowed to fall more forward; about the fourth month of pregnancy, the womb may be felt in the abdomen, and ridng out of the pelvis; in the fifth month the fundus is about half-way betwixt the pubes and navel; in the feventh, it is about half-way betwixt the navel and fcrobiculus cordis; in the eighth, it is at its highed, and towards the end of the ninth month, it rather fubfides. Finally, immediately before labour it de- feends remarkably, and fhifts into the middle of the pelvis, fo as fairly to prefent the orifice of the womb. The mufcularity of the uterus is increafing from the fird moment of pregnancy. As the uterus increafes in thicknefs and is didended, the mufcular fibres become more didindi, and their power of contraction greater ; but what is very particular is the great mufcular efforts made by the womb during labour by thefe fibres, which have not till that time felt the dimulus to action, or been allowed to contract.

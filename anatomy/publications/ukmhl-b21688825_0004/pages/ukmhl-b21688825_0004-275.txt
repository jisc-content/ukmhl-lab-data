A, the cavity of the ute- rus ; B, the continued cavity, where it is very narrow towards the cervex. C, the canal of the cervex, where it has an enlargement like a finus. The Falopean. tubes going off from the cavity of the uterus. Thefe angles of the cavity admit no more than a hogâ€™s bridle. The third angle, towards the neck, is, of courfe, confxderably larger. The proper triangular cavity of the uterus is lined with a peculiar foft and delicate membrane ; it is very vafcular, and the veffels either open on the furface naturally, or burding out from time to time, pour out the mendrual blood. The canal of the cervex fhows a very different furface. We obferve a prominent longitudinal line on the fore and back part of it, from which oblique and tranfverfe rugae go out. The furface is firmer and callous, and lefs vafcular. Betwixt the rugae there are lacunae, which throw out a mucilaginous fluid ; and towards the orifice we'fee thefe larger, and fometimes didindt glan- dular bodies. This peculiar fhape of the cavity of the womb, and the hardnefs and fmall degree of vafcularity of the lower part, is of the mod effehtial importance. The upper part, the proper cavity of the womb, is prepared for the reception and immediate adhefion of the ovum, when it fliall have defcended through the Falopean tube; but the long callous cervex is provided, that there may be no adhefion to the lower part of the womb, and that the placenta may not form over the orifice of the womb, for if it fhould, the mod danger- ous

OF THE LIVER. The- transverse fissure is that which partes above the lobulus fpigelii, and lobulus quadratus; the proceffus caudatus, and the lobulus lobi fmiftri. It is in this fiflure that the great tranfverfe divifion of the vena ports lies. The posterior, fissure* gives lodgment to the duttus venofus. It is a divifion in the pofterior mar- gin of the liver betwixt the left lobe, and the lobulus fpigelii, and great lobe on the right. Sometimes, in- ftead of the fiflure or fulcus, there is a canal, as it were, in the fubftance of the liver. The fourth great fiflure, is that for the lodgment of the vena cava. It fometimes is called, in contra- diftindtion to the laft, the right fiflure, or the fissura ven/e cavas. It is a large deep divifion betwixt the lobulus fpigelii and the back part of the right lobe, for receiving the vena cava as it partes up upon the fpine. The gall-bladder being funk in the fubftance of the liver, the pit or excavation which receives it has been confidered improperly as a fiflure or foffa f. There likeways occur irregular fiffures in the fubftance of the liver, which are like the curs of the knife, and hold no regular place.

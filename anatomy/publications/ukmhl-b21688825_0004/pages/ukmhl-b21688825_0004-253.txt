TUE external parts OF GENERATION. 211 relaxed (late, they are deprived of this covering : they project from under the labiae, and are apt to become inflamed-, and even t0 ulcerate. The original difeafe, or tumor, is augmented, or they become perhaps hard and callous. In children they bear a very great pro- portion to the other parts-, and are more confpicuous and prominent than in the adult. Their difeafed en- largement fometimes requires to be extirpated, in which operation, as they are very vafcular, and as v/ith their growth, their blood-veffels enlarge, confi- derable hasmorrhagy may be expe&ed. A furgeon of this city, in extirpating a tumor of this kind from a young lady, thought his duty fulfilled when he had applied a piece of lint upon the furface after the opera- tion, fo that he even negle&ed to appoint an attendant. The hsemorrhagy returned, and continued fo profufe that before the furgeon arrived the lady had fainted. The clitoris is fimilar to the male penis. Like the penis, it confifls of cells for receiving blood, and in a fimilar manner, it arifes from, or takes hold of the rami of the os pubis by two crura ; â€” thefe unite at the fymphyfis pubis, to form the body of the clitoris, which is fufpended from the os pubis, like the penis, by a kind of ligament. The clitoris has all'o a kind of glans, over which the integuments make a fold like a preputium. In fhort, it has the fame fenfibilities, the fame power of erection with the membrum virile ; on- ly it has no urethra nor fpongy body, like that of the urethra of man. The dories of the increafe of this inftrument, even to its preeminence in fize over the male penis, are very idle, but there feems to be a peculiar predilection for P 4 them.

CHAP. I. OF THE LYMPHATIC AND LACTEAL SYSTEMS OF VESSELS. INTRODUCTORY VIEWS. We have underflood that the red blood circulates in the body, through veffels (the arteries and veins) which have a diredt communication at their extremities by inofculation ; that although thefe veffels lie parallel to each other, and extend from the heart to the re- moteft part of the body, yet the blood is faid to pafs through the circulation, becaufe it is tranfmltted from the veins into the arteries through the medium of the heart; and from the extremities of the arteries diredtly into the veins, returning again to the centre. In this tranfmiffion of the blood through continuous tubes, there is in the coats of the veffels an alternation of con- traction and relaxation which impels it forward* But befides thefe arteries and veins carrying the red blood through the body, there are other veffels more remote in their connedlion with what is generally called the circulating fyftem of veffels. SECTION I. OF THE CAPILLARY VESSELS. The capillary veffels are thofe extreme branches which are as minute as hairs; but this, though the U 3 literal.

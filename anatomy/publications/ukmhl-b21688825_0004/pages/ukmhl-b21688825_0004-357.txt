OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 315 the tendon of the tibialis anticus mufcle, and before the head of the tibia, following the principal branch of the great faphena vein; and then continues its courfe in company with the faphena to the infide of the knee. 2. There is at the fame time a confiderable number of lymphatics, taking their origin from nearly the fame place, viz. the infide of the foot, and before the inner ancle ; but they take a different courfe on the leg from the laft clafs ; for they pafs behind the lower head of the tibia : they now attach themfelves to fome branch of the faphena vein? and join the former fet on the infide of the knee. From this they afcend fuperficially above the fafcia to the glands of the groin. 3. From the out- fide of the foot there afcend feveral lymphatics; a di- vifion of which paffes before the outer ancle and acrofs the tibia to join the lymphatics, parafites of the great faphena vein, and here they fometimes form plexus and contortions; others turn in behind the outer ancle, and join the branches accompanying the leffer faphena. The lymphatics which turn round behind the outer ancle pafs on the outfide of the tendo achillis; and ac- companying the leffer faphena vein, fink into the popli- teal hollow. Here they unite with the lymphatics which have accompanied the feveral arteries of the leg and foot, and particularly the poflerior tibial artery. Popliteal glands. The glands of the ham-firing cavity are generally three in number, and very finall. They receive the lymphatics, which pafs with the in- ternal tibial artery and with the leffer faphena, and they of courfe fvvell and become inflamed in confe- quence of fores on the calf of the leg, outfide of the foot, and foie of the foot.

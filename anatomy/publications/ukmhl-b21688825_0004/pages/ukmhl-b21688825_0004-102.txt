OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 7o knowledge of difeafes has been drawn from an acquaint- ance with anatomy, from the frequent infpe&ion of dead bodies, and the obfervation of the fymptoms du- ring life, that the ftudy of the difeafes connected with the duodenum is the mofl important which can occupy the attention of the medical enquirer. OF THE SMALL INTESTINES IN GENERAL. The fmall inteftines, under the name of jejunum and ileon, occupy- the fpace in the middle and lower part of the abdomen, the great mafs forming convolu- tions in the umbilical region. The cylindrical canal of the fmall inteftines is gradually and imperceptibly diminifhed in diameter as it is removed from the lower orifice of the ftomach ; fo that the termination of the ilion in the caput coli is confiderably fmaller than the duodenum. This tract of the fmall inteftines performs the moft important function of the chylipoetic vifcera (if any can be faid to be peculiarly important where the whole is fo ftridtly connected); for here the food is moved flowly onward through a length of inteftine more than four times the length of the body *, and ex- pofed to a furface amazingly extended by the pendu- lous and loofe duplicatures of the inner coat. Here the faeces are gradually feparated from the chyle, and the chyle adhering to the villi is abforbed and carried into the fyftem of veffels. * The whole length of the inteftinal canal is generally eftimated at from fix to feven times the length of the whole body.

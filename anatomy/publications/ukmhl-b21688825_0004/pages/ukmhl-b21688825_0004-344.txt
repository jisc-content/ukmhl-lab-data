302 ORIGIN OF THE LYMPHATICS, fluids diredly into the cellular membrane, and injeded the lymphatics. Thus by an error, by an accidental effed of their injedion, the minds of Dr. Hunter and Monro were opened to a freer difcuflion of the re- ceived opinions and approved authorities. Soon, however, it was underflood by thofe converfant with anatomy, that thefe accidental injedions of the lym- phatics did not prove the lymphatics to take their origin either from the cells or from the extreme arteries; but already this good effect, at leaft, was produced, that menâ€™s minds were excited to inquire after new fads and trains of obfervation. It was now recolleded, that a Arid; analogy and correfpondence fubfifted betwixt the lymphatics and ladeals; the proofs of the ladeals being abforbents, were recalled to memory ; new proofs of their being the foie abforbents of the inteftines were brought forward ; the nature of the fluids effufed into the various cavities and cells of the body was attended to ; and the conviction followed, that the moft eflfen- tial ufe of the lymphatic veflels was to ferve as a fyftera of abforbents, to take up the extravafated fluids. They refleded that to diftend the inteflines with injec- tion would never fill the ladeals; and were convinced that the injedion of the lymphatics could not be fup- pofed to be through the proper abforbing mouths of thefe veflels opening upon the cells; but rather that the injedion had entered the veflels by the rupture of their extreme branches. Thus the theory of the lym- phatics being a fyflem of abforbents, came to reft on analogy, and the obfervation of the phenomena of the living body. The

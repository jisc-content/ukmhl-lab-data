OF THE STOMACH. 4* fcribed *. For an example of this apparent irregularity* there comes down upon the flat fide of the flomach an irregular fafciculus of fibres, apparently from the longi- tudinal fibres of the cardiac orifice, and continued from thofe of the oefophagus, which yet take a courfe fairly encircling the flomach. They cannot be flri&ly faid to belong to either the circular or longitudinal feries, and in many places thofe which run longitudinally on the flomach feem to fink and lofe themfelves amongfl the lower fibres, or are reflected into tranfverfe fibres. Thefe mufcular fibres of the flomach do not run in an uninterrupted courfe, but fplit, rejoin, and form a kind of retiform texture through which the coats be- neath are at intervals difcernible. This flruflure would appear to bellow a greater power of contraction on the flomach. The flrong longitudinal fibres which are feen upon the oefophagus form the outer flratum of the mufcular coat of the flomach, and they extend from the oefophagus and cardiac orifice in a flellated form alongfl the upper curvature, and downward upon the great end or facculus ventriculi. Then we have to obferve a fet of circular fibres, which forming rings upon the great end, extend over all the flomach, like the circular fibres of the arteries. Thefe fibres do not each encircle the flomach entirely, but while their ge- neral dire&ion is circular, they are fo interwoven that * The moil general opinion is, that there are three layers of fibres in the flomach. Some defcfibe an external longitudinal feries ; a middle tranfverfe ftratum ; and again the internal fibres running longitudinally. See Galeati Acad, de Bologne. no

Though of various forms they are generally of an oval fhape, and they vary in fize from the twentieth part of an inch to a full inch in diameter. Sometimes they are fegregated,â€”fometimes accumulated and cluftered to- gether. The colour of thofe bodies is various in the feveral parts of the body : in young animals they are redder, and become pale only with age. They are redder and ftronger in the outer parts of the body, as in the thigh, axilla, &c. lefs fo within the abdomen and thorax. 2. The latter will not bear fo high a column of mercury as the former. The mefenteric glands are faid totally to difappear in old age*. It would appear that the glands of this fyftem are of more importance to young animals than to adults. In the foetus and in children the la&eal and lymphatic glands are exceedingly numerous; but they fhrink or difappear with old age. In the foetus, indeed, they can be of no very efiential ufe; they are then rather in a date of preparation for the aflions necefiary in infancy and youth. It is then alfo that they are mod liable to difeafe, and feem more irritable and ready to inflame, efpecially in fuperficial fituations. About the age of fourteen or fifteen this difpofition is changed, which is commonly faid to proceed from the increafed vigour of the conftu tution, and the change which then takes place on the organs of generation. It is rather to be attributed, however, to the diminution of irritability and a&ivity of their veflels in verging to the adult ftate, which is marked by their comparatively lefs fize, and finaller de- * By Buyfch, Morgagni, Haller, Sheldon. gree

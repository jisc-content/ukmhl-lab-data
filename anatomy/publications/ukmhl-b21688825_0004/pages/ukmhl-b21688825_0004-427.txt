The gum is firm, and in clofe adhefion, when the teeth are healthy; loofe, fpongy, or fhrunk, when they are difeafed. The only means of operating upon the general date of the teeth is through the gums; and by keeping them in a date of healthy action by the brufh and tinctures, the dentid fixes the teeth, and preferves them healthy ; but when they are allowed to be ioofe and fpongy, and fubjedt to frequent bleeding, (which is improperly called a fcor? butic date,) the teeth become loofe, and the gums painful. If a healthy tooth be implanted in the jaw, the gum grows up around it, and adheres to it; but if it be dead or difeafed, the gum ulcerates, loofens, and fhrinks from it; and this fhrinking of the gums is foon followed by the ubforption of the alveoli. From the diforder of the teeth, the gums are fubjedt to many difeafes; fome of them troublefome, fome dangerous, or at lead giving rife to dangerous difeafes. They fwell from tooth-ach and inflammation of the centre of the tooth (parulis), or form tumors from the fide of the tooth (epulis). Often fuppuration follows thefe fwellings; and the matter making its way by the fide of the jaw, and dedroying the alveoli, troublefome fiftulae are the confequence. The accumulation of tartar on the teeth is the caufe of an ulceration and wading of the gums, in the end very injurious to the teeth. The foft, fpongy, and bleeding tumors which arife from the gums, are in fact difeafes of the bone, * See Heriffant. Cc 3 OS'

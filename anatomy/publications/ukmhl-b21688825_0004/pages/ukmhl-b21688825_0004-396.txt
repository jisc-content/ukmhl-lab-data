354 APPENDIX, back of the arm is left without any remarkable veins > taking their courfe there. The veins on the back of the hand have nerves in- termingling with them, viz. branches of the ulnar nerve, and the extreme branches of the mufcular fpi- ral nerve: fo that it is a great mi hake to fuppofe that bleeding in the back of the hand might be fubftituted with advantage for the common operation in the bend of the arm. Vena cephaliga.â€”The vein of the back of the thumb running into a trunk, which takes a courfe over the outfi.de of the wrift, is called cephaliga polli- cis. From this vein and the divilion of the plexus of the back of the hand, a confiderable trunk is generally formed-, which takes its courfe on the radial edge of the arm, and is called cephalica minor, or radia- :lis externa. This vein in its tract over the extern- for radialis, and the fupinator longus, has many la- teral communications, particularly with the median vein. This vein, now joined by the median cephalic, and rifing upon the outfide of the humerus, is the great cephalic vein ; and it pafles, firlt betwixt the biceps and triceps brachii, and then betwixt the deltoides and pec- toralis major mufcles. Several fmall cutaneous veins play over the belly of the biceps mufcle, and commu- nicate with the bafilic vein ; a little below the external condyle of the os humeri, the cephalic vein detaches a branch which afcends betwixt the brachialis internum and fupinator longus, and which afterwards forms inofculations with the bafilic vein, on the back of the arm.

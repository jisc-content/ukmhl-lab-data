I afterwards opened the body, where the womb being enlarged by difeafe, had produced much the fame effect as if it had been enlarged by pregnancy, viz. obftrudion of the urethra ; for the body of the womb had fallen into the hollow of the facrum, and had formed adhefions there with the redum, while the orifice of the womb preffed forward upon the os pubis, fo as to produce an obftrudion of urine.

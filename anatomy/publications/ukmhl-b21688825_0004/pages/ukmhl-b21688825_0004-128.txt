OF THE LIVER. 96 of its fun&ion. The ancients made it the fupreme diredtor of the animal fyftem. They fuppofed that they could trace the nutritious fluids of the inteftines through the meferaic veins into the porta and into the liver, and that it was there concodted into blood. From the liver to the right fide of the heart they found the cava hepatica, carrying this blood formed in the , liver to the centre of the fyftem : and through the veins they fuppofed the blood to be carried to the re- mote part of the body. The liver is the largeft glandular body of the whole fyftem. Its ufe is to fecrete the bile, which is carried into the inteftines, and performs there an eflential adtion on the food while pafling in the tract of the in- teflines. Seat of the liver.â€”The liver is feated in the upper part of the abdomen, under the margin of the ribs, and towards the right fide, or in the right hypo- chondrium. In the fcetus it occupies more of the left fide than it does in the adult. Indeed it is nearly equally balanced in the foetus, but the older the animal (or at lead for the five firft years) the greater will be the proportion of it found lodged in the right fide. Without going into the more minute fubdivifions of this vifcus, we may obferve, that it is more uniform, and fmooth, and convex on the upper furface; on the lower, more irregularly concave. Its upper furface is applied in dofe contact to the concavity of the diaphragm, and in the fcetus its margin is in contact with the abdominal jnufcles, becaufe it falls lower than the margin of the ribs. Its lower and concave furface receives the con- vexity of the ftomach, duodenum, and colon. In a healthy

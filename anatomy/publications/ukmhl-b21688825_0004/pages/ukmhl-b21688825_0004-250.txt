2o8 the external parts of generation* C H A P. I. THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF GENERATION. The external parts of generation are the mons ve- neris, labiae, clitoris, nymphae, urethra, hymen, or carur.culas myrtiformes. Upon thefe fubjeds we have no want of books and information ; for accoucheurs of the old fchool dwelt upon the defcription with par- ticular accuracy. Thefe parts were within their ken, which we cannot fay of the vifcera of the pelvis: and^ therefore, upon t^e former we (hall be more brief. In very young children thefe external parts bear a large proportion to the body, ^greater than at any fub- fequent period before the age of puberty. At puberty they are fuddenly and completely evolved, and acquire an increafeâ€™of fize ; while, from the age of two years to twelve or thirteen, there has been little increafe. Immediately before menflruation, commences the con- nedion which occaficns, or accompanies that flux. It begins to effed the evolution of the uterine fyftem, and to fit it for its peculiar fundion. The parts become turgid and yafcular ; the fat is depofited in the furrounding cellular membrane. About the fortieth year, when the menfes difappear, this fullnefs of the private parts alfo ceafes, and the fat is reabforbed. The mons veneris, is that prominence on the fymphyus pubis, which confifts of the fkin rai^Cgd and cufhioned up by the fat inclofed in the cellular mem- brant.

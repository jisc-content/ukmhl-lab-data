220 OF THE LIVER. or the vafa vaforum in the great vefiels. The pulmonic artery carries venous blood into the lungs, which hav- ing returned from the circulation of the body cannot fend off fmaller branches to fuppiy the membranes and vefiels of the lungs, it is neceflary that for this purpofe branches of the aortic fyftem (hall enter the lungs. Again, in the heart the blood contained in its ventri- cles is incapable of fupplying its fubllance, or the blood coming through the calibre of the great vefiels cannot be the means of miniftering to their a&ive powers, but for this purpofe the vafa vaforum are diftributed through the coats of the vefiels. Thefe vefiels there- fore bear an analogy to the arteria hepatica in the liver. We mud not however fuppofe that this fcheme of the a&ion of the vafcular fyftem of the liver, however rational and fimple, will be univerfally allowed. Indeed there are circumftances which feem to (land in oppofi- tion to it. Of thefe, the molt interefting is the cafe of unufual diftribution of the vefiels of the liver com- municated by Mr. Abernethy of St. Bartholomewâ€™s hofpital. The fubjeft was a female infant which was fuppofed to be about ten months old. Among other varieties it was obferved, that the branch of the cceliac artery diftributed to the liver was larger than common, and exceeded by more than one third the ufual fize of the fplenic artery. This was the only veffel which fupplied the liver with blood for the purpofe of either nutrition or fecretion. The vena portarum was formed in the ufual manner, but terminated in the inferior cava nearly on a line with the renal veins. The liver was 14 of

INTRODUCTION. 8 lyfis of dnimal matter, leaves its devotees in a perplexity of knowledge and difcoveries which have no end, and which point to no conclufion. There are produced from the blood a variety of fluids by organs which are called glands, and the form- ation or feparation of thefe fluids is fecretion. But the folid parts of the body ought to be confidered as fecretions equally with the matter which flows from the duds of glands. For there is formed and depo- fited from the blood, during the round of its circula- tion, bone to fupport the incumbent weight of the body â€¢, mufcular fibre, to give it motion ; as well as all the other variety of folid3 and fluids. The only difference betwixt thefe folid depofitions from the blood and the glandular fecretions is, that the former are ftill within the influence of the vafcular fyftem, and that they are decompofed and re-abforbed, conveyed again into the mafs of circulating fluids before they can be finally expelled from the body. The chemifts have obferved the divilion of animal bodies into folids and fluids, but the fubdivifions of thefe are very inaccurate. The fluids they have dif- tinguilhed into three clafles; iff, Recrementitious hu- mours, which go to nourilh and fupport the body; 2dly, The excrementitious fluids, which are carried out of the body by certain emunftuaries; and the 3d are of a compound nature, being partly recremen- titious and partly excrementitious. We muff obferve, however, that the fluids enumerated under thefe heads fliew it to be a very incorrect arrangement. Thefitjl divifion comprehends the fat, the marrow, the matter of internal perfpiration, and the ofleous juice. The

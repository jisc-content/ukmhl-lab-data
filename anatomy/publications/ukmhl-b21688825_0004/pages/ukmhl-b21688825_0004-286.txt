244 OF THE WOMB. plilhing. To explain this, I may be allowed to take a fhort preliminary view : each particular organ or vif- cus, whilft it has its connections with the general fyf- tem, is, in truth, a fyftem within itfelf, having its pe- culiar functions, fympathies, and even vafcular ac- tion, in a certain degree, independently. \Yere not this, in fome meafure the cafe, we fliould fee no local difeafe or topical aCtion ; and no vafcular aCtion could be for a moment ftationary and confined to one, part. Ihe body would, indeed, be then only one great hy- draulic machine. But while the feveral parts have the property of being excited feparately to an accelerated action, they are actuated by remote fympathies, and by thefe fympathies and relations, is the whole fyftem in a great meafure fupported. Before menftruation commences, there is a preced- ing indifpofition, and fymptoms indicating a conftitu- tional affeftion. And thefe complaints are ufually more fevere in the firfl, than in the fubfequent periods. The general revolution in the fyftem begins to accu- mulate its aCtion towards the womb, and thofe fymp- toms ufually accompanying uterine irritation, fiiow how far it is affeCted, and in a little time the menfes flow. Now, I conceive, the flow of the menftrual blood, to be not the end which nature is here labour- ing to accomplilh, but the means of allaying the ex- cited ftate of the uterine fyftem after the object is ac- complilhed. It is not the difcharge of a few ounces of blood which relieves the fyftem ; for drawing blood limply will not do it; but it is the excited aCtion of the uterine fyftem which relieves the general diftrefs, and that topical aCtion has full relief in the menftruail difcharge*

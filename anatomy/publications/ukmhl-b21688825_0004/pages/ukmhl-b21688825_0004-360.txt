318 OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. like other abcefles in the track of thefe veflels, would fall down upon the thigh. The fad, however, is curious; that when the lymphatics difeafed enter one fet of glands, there will be no buboe ; when they take a courfe to the other, they inflame and fuppurate. This 1 believe may be explained, from confidering the po- fiton of the inguinal glands, as being immediately under the (kin : for experience fhows that a part near the furface will inflame and proceed to fuppuration much more readily than a part deep feated, though fuffering from the fame degree of excitement. In the external parts of woman (by Mr. Cruick- lhanksâ€™s obfervation) there are alfo two fets of lympha- tics. Thofe near the clitoris pafs up in a diredtfon to the ring; and thofe from the lower part of the vulva and perineum to the glands of the groin. Lymphatics and glands within the liga- ment of the thigh. The vafa efterentia of the inguinal glands are in number from two to fix. The deep lymphatics which accompany the femoral vein and artery, lying under the cellular membrane, pafs under the ligament, and foon form a large net-work of veflels accompanying the iliac veflels, in which they are joined by the branches of lymphatics from the fuperflcial glands ; fometimes the trunks accompanying the great veflels of the thigh pafs into a gland, imme- diately within the ligament; fometimes one or two of them only enter into the glands high in the loins; nay, fometimes a large veflel pafles on diredly to the thoracic dud. From fix to eight or ten glands are feated in the trad of the external iliac veflels, under the name of external iliac glands. And upon the infide of 1 the

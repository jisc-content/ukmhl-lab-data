It depends on the ftate of the fecretions which bedew thefe parts, and arifes either from a defi- ciency of fecretion or from an unufually acrid ftate of it. It would appear to be placed as a monitor calling for the dilution of the fluids by drink, when they have been exhaufted by the fatigue of the body and by per- fpiration, or when the contents of the ftomach require a more fluid ftate,—the more eafily to fuffer the necef- fary changes of digeftion. The cardiac orifice is the chief feat of all fenfations of the ftomach both natural and unufual, as it is the molt fenflble part of the ftomach. Indeed we might prefume this much by turning to the defcription and plates of the nerves; for we {hall find that this upper part of the ftomach is provided in a peculiar manner with nerves, the branches of the par vagum.

3 SO APPENDIX. monly there are two branches high in the neck, froni the anterior and pofterior facial veins, which unite about the middle of it. When they are double they have this courfe ; the anterior and £tfter/to/jugular vein, may be faid to begin from the anterior facial vein; it then receives the fubmental vein, which comes in un- ifier the bafe of the lower jaw—the ranine veins alfo, and veins from the glands under th? jaw join it here: where it is before the maftoid mufcle, it forms free communications with the internal jugular veins; and here alfo, it receives veins from the fide of the throat *. Almofi: all the ramifications of veins, which in one fubjedt unite to the external jugular vein, and which come from the face and throat, do in others fink down into the internal jugular vein. Sometimes the anterior and external jugular veins join the internal jugular vein ; fometimes the fub- clavean vein. The pofierior external jugular vein is formed chiefly by the temporal vein, or, poflerior facial vein, which comes down from under the parotid gland ; it is then joined by the occipital veins f, a little lower by the cer- vical veins, and laftly on the lower part of the neck it receives the mufcular branches from the ffefh of the fhoulder ; it then finks into the fubclavean veins. Of the thyroid veins.—The thyroid gland has two fets of veins, as it has of arteries ; the fuperior thy- * Viz. The fuperior thyroid veins, and the deep laryngeal reins. f Thefe communicate with the vertebral veins, and through the pOitcrior maftoid foramen with the lateral iinus - raid

THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF GENERATION. 2JJ From the length and hidden turns of the male ure- thra, from the double function It performs, and from its being embraced by the proftate gland, the obftruc- tions of the urine are more frequent, and the catheter lefs eafily palled, than in woman. The catheter too requires to be of a very peculiar form. The fliort and wide urethra of woman requires only a fimple and al~ molt ftreight tube: and although, accurately to adapt it to the courfe of the urethra, a confiderable curve might be given to it, yet that is not necelfary in com- mon cafes; and circumftances will occur to the accou- cheur which will preclude the poffibility of ufing fuch an inftrument. We lhall only mention here fuch cafes of obftruc- lion of urine as are in a particular manner illuflrated by the anatomy and connection of the parts. Thefe are tumors of the ovarium, tumors of the womb, polypi, diftenfion of the vagina, difplacement of the womb, as procedentia, prolapfus, retroverfio, &c.; and laftly, the childâ€™s head in labour. The ovarium being enlarged, and failing down into the pelvis, either prefies upon the neck of the bladder* caufing obftructions, or preffing and weighing on the fundus of the bladder, itoccafionsa ftillicidium urines. Tumors of the womb, efpecially of the neck or ori- fice, as it is in contact with the urethra, very foon af- fect this organ. Thus, I have feen a cancer of the orifice of the womb, by exciting inflammation in all the furrounding parts, and by mailing them together into a tumor filling the pelvis, occafion obfiinare ob~ firu&ion of urine. Polypi attached to the orifice of the womb, and filling the vagina, produce the fame effect. In all fuch 12

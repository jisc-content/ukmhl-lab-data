When a wound or puncture, fuch as that which the ftudent of anatomy may receive in the directing room, has been made on the little or ring finger, the red lines which often appear in confequence of it, have taken the courfe of the ulnar edge of the fore arm, and termi- nated in the infide of the arm, near the condyle ; in fome inftances they have been continued even into the axilla. If venereal matter is abforbed at any point of the hand, near the little or ring finger, or by thofe fingers, the gland on the inner condyle of the humerus, or fome one in the courfe of the brachial artery, will mofi: probably inflame and form a bubo, and the furgeon will be aware of this abforption; but if the venereal matter be abforbed on the thumb or fore finger, it is poflible that it may not pafs into the glands until it comes into the infide of the clavicle. Thefe glands being out of our fight and feeling, the patient may be infedted without the furgeon fufpedl- ing.it *. LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK.

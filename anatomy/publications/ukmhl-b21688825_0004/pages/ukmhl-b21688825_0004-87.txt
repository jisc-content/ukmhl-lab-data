OF THE STOMACH. 55 Buverney, and of M. Chirac in Hifl. de l’Acad. des Sciences, 1700. M. Littre oppofed this notion, and contended before the Academy, that the contraction of the diaphragm was the principal caufe of vomiting. M. Lieutaud in 1752 fupported the idea that vomiting is the effect of the action of the ftomach. He found, upon diffeCtion, in a patient whofe ftomach had refilled every kind of emetic, that it was greatly diftended and become infenfible ; and concluded that the want of ac- tion in the ftomach, and confequent lofs of the power of vomiting, was a ftrong proof of the action being the effect of the contraction of the ftomach only. There are other more curious inftances of difeafe of the fto- mach preventing the mufcular contraction in any vio- lent degree, and confequently the abfence of the ufual fymptom of vomiting :—an inftance of this kind will be feen in Dr. Stark’s work. In my Mufeum, Surgeons’ Square, there is a preparation of a ftomach, in which the walls had become fo thick that they could no longer fuffer contraction by the mufcular fibres; the confe- quence of which was that, although the inner coat of the ftomach was in a raw and ulcerated flate, there was no aCtive vomiting, The fingultus feems the partial exertion of the fyin- pathy betwixt the upper orifice of the ftomach and the diaphragm, by which a kind of weak fpafmodic action is excited in it, but without a concomitant inverted ac- tion in the ftomach and cefophagus. It is a convuliive and fonorous infpiration, owing to an irritation of the upper orifice of the ftomach and cefophagus, but not exaCtly of that kind which caufes inverfion of the natu- E 4 ral

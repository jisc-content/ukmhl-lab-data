49 OF THE STOMACH. iio one fafciculus can be followed to a great extent. Thefe are called the transverse fibres or stratum ; while the deeped dratum confids of the continued cir- cular fibres of the cefophagus. Thefe lad fibres are drong upon the cardiac orifice, and may be prefumed to form a kind, of fphinfter ; but they diminifh as they are'remote from the fuperior orifice. The lower or pyloric orifice of the domach, howevc,is more carefully guarded by mufcular fibres; having in the duplicature of the inner coats a didinct circular ring of mufcular fibres. The cellular tiiTue, being intermingled with the mufcular fibres, conne&s and drengthens them, and gives the appearance of little white lines interwoven with the mufcular fibres, and which fome have de- fcribed as fmall tendons *. There is alfo to be obferved a broad ligamentous band on the two flat furfaces of the domach towards the pylorus. They are like the bands of the colony but not nearly fo drong or evi- dent. They are formed by the denfer nature.of the cellular tiffue, and more intimate union betwixt the fird and fecond coats. OF THE ACTION OF THE MUSCULAR COAT. Upon confidering the weakaefs of the mufcular fibres of the domach, and the membranous nature of the whole coats, it appears that the general adtion of the domach is flow, regular, and by no means a for- cible contradion 5 not an apparatus for triturating the food, but merely giving motion to its contents.

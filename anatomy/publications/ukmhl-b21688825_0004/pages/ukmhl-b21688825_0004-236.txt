OF THE TESTES. 200 nexed plans, the tedicle of the left fide is reprefented, which we know from the points c, being dire&ed backward, while the epididimis is laid along the left fide of the infertion of the chord. OF THE VESICULJE SEMINALES. Behind the prodate gland, and attached to the lowed part of the urinary bladder, lie two foft bodies, which are the veficulae feminales. They appear like fimple bags when feen from without, but difle&ions fhow them to confid of a cellular drudture ; each of thefe bodies is about three fingers-breadth in length ; their backmod point is large and round, and, at the fame time, that they diverge from each other, their narrow points unite, or are contiguous to each other forwards, and enter at the back part of the bafe of the prodate gland. As we have feen, the peritoneum does not defcend far enough betwixt the bladder and return to co- ver or inved thefe veficulse; they are therefore involved in the cellular texture, and covered with drong fibres, befides being fubjeft to the compreflion of the levator ani mufcle. When the veficulae are cut into, and efpecially when they are didended, dried, and cut, they prefent a cellular appearance; but if they are carefully differed, they prefent the appear- ance of a fmall blind intedine convoluted. This cellular appearance is given by the duplication of their inner membrane, together with the didortions and curves of the canal. Their outer furface is co- 5 vered

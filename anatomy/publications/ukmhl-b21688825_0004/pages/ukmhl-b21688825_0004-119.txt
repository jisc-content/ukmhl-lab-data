37 OF THE GREAT INTESTINES. into the ileon. In the oblong opening of the ileon, and in the broadnefs of the valvular membranes, there is confiderable variety. The fuperior valve is tranf- verfe, fmaller and narrower than the lower one; the lower one is longer, and takes a more extenfive curve: and fometimes the lower one is fo remarkably larger than the upper valve, that it gives a great degree of obliquity to the infertion of the ileon into the colon, fo as to approach to that ftruffure which we fee in the entrance of duffs, as the biliary duff into the inteftine, or the ureter into the bladder. At the extremities of thefe valves they coalefce and run into the common tranfverfe folds of the colon: and this is what Mor- gagni has called the frsena. At this place of union of the ilion and colon the longitudinal mufcular fibres of the ilion are mingled and confounded with the circular fibres of the colon *. The circular mufcular fibres certainly enter fo far into the compofition of the valve, that they embrace the margin, and, by contracting during life, muft make the experiments on the affion of this valve in the dead body lefs decifive than they would be were we certain that this valve affs on principles ftriffly mechanical. The difcovery of the valve of the colon, and which, from its affion in guarding the ileon, might rather be called the valve of the ileon, has been claimed or attributed to many anatomifts, chiefly to Varolius, Bauhin, and Tulpius ; and it fometimes receives the name of the two later anatomifts. * Winflow. g4 CCSCUM.

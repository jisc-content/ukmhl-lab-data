By this means -the matter of the lower portion of the inteftinal canal is carried into the upper part, and there aCting as an unufual ftimulus it aggravates and perpetuates the un- natural aCtion. Nay, from experiments it appears that a permanent irritation will caufe an accelerated motion in both directions, that from the point ftimulated there will proceed downward the regular feries of contrac- tions and dilatations, while the motion is fent upwards and retrograde from the fame point of the inteftine toward the ftomach *. And this obfervation, the exhi- bition of medicine and the difeafes of the inteftines confirm. But farther we may obferve, that the food is not uniformly moved downward; it is fhifted and agitated by an occafional retrograde motion thus: The portion of the inteftine included under A con- tracts and fends its contents into B. B contracting fends its fluid contents in part backward into A, but * Haller, Ioc. cit., Expsr. 424. in

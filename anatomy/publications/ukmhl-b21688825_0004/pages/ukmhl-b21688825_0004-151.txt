ii 9 OF THE LIVER. OF THE SECRETION OF THE BILE. Upon reviewing the whole fyftem of the liver the peculiarities in the vena portae ftrike us the mod. It occurs to us that the palling of this profufion of blood retrograde into the liver, with the flow motion peculiar to venous blood, and after having gone the circulation through the intellines, and confequently loft thofe pro- perties which conftituted it arterial blood, is a provifion for the fecretion of the bile. It is almoft univerfally concluded, that the fecretion of bile is made from the blood of the vena portae. But as we fee that this blood diftributed by the branches of the vena portae in the liver muft be fo far exhaufted as to become incapable of all the ufes ac- complilhed by the arterial blood in other glands, that although the vena portae be peculiarly adapted to fe- crete the bile, it is not capable of fupplying the nutrition and the energy to the fubftance and veflels of the liver, there is a neceflity for arterial blood being fent to this gland through a branch of the arterial fyftem. We have had occafion to remark, that no part retains its funftion in vigour, nor the living properties which are inherent in it, while the whole oeconotny is entire and correct, unlefs the blood be circulated through it. Therefore it would appear neceflary that the arteria hepatica, a branch of the aortic fyftem, ftiould alfo be bellowed upon this vifcus. Thefe arteries perform the fame office here in the liver that the bronchial arteries do in the lungs, or the coronary arteries in the heart, I 4 or

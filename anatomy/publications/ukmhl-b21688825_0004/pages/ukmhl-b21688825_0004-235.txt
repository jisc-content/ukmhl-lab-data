I99 OF THE TESTES. In this 8th plan, fig. 1. we fee the tefticle as in its natural fituation, covered with its membranes, and appearing like one body ; while, in the fecond figure, it being reprefented freed from its outer coat, we fee the epididimis as laid upon the tefticle, and confiding of the convoluted tube. Firft, we obferve A, the body of the tefticle ; B, the beginning of the epididimis, or the large head of the epididimis *. Then we fee it laid alongft the back of the tefticle, and obferve C to be the fmall head of the epididimis 7, where the tube is refle&ed to reafcend upon the tefticle, and to form D, the vas deferens. Now, we have to obferve, that the point C, fig. 2. or fmall head of the epididimis, hangs over the tefti- cle, and points backwards to the perineum, and can be felt through the whole coats; and that the body of the tefticle A, is towards us when we examine a pa- tient.â€”Further, as the letters in figure 1 and 2. refer to the fame points, we have only to notice the fainter indication of the parts in fig. 1. it being inverted with the coats; and to obferve the general relation of the tefticle to the fcrotum and penis. There is one other circumftance to be obferved, viz. that the epididimis is always laid on the outer fide of the infertion of the chord into the tefticle ; from which we diftinguilh, with eafe, in a preparation, to which fide the tefticle belongs. Thus, in the an- t * Globus major, or head. f Globus minor canda. This part we often diftingulh retain- ing its hardnefs after the fubfiding of the general fwelling of hernea femoralis. From this point we can trace all the connec- tions of the other parts, nexed

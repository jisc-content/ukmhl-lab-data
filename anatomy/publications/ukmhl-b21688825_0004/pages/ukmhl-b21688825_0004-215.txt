0F THE TESTES. 183 that which controuls and directs the growth of parts ? When the parts in a foetus before the defcent of the tefticle are differed, there is found a ligamentous, or cellular cord, mingled with the fibres of the cre- rnafter mufcle, and which takes its origin from the groin, is reflected into the abdominal ring, and ftretches up to the body of the tefticle. This body is called ligament or gubernaculum, and to the agency of this bundle of fibres, is the defcent of the tefticle attributed. There are, however, objections to this. If we fuppofe that the cremafler mufcle, by its exertion, brings down the tefticle to the ring. How does it pafs the ring ? for furely we cannot fuppofe that this muifcle, which takes its origin from the internal oblique mufcle, con- fequently within, can contract, not only fo as to bring the tefticle to the very point of its origin, but to pro- trude it pad that point, and through the tendon of the external oblique mufcle. Again, animals have the cremafler mufcle, whofe tefticles never defcend out of the belly ;â€”again, the veflels of the cord, before the tefticle has fully defcended, (how no marks of being: dragged down, for they are elegantly tortuous. As the tefticle paffes very flowly from the loins to the ring; fo, after it has efcaped from the belly, it paffes flowly from the ring to the bottom of the fcrotum. It commonly remains fome time by the fide of the penis, and only by degrees defcends to the bottom cf the fcrotum *. In * Mr. Hunter has fhewn, that the detention of the tefticle in the belly is in confequence of fome defect and want of adtion in N4. tl-e

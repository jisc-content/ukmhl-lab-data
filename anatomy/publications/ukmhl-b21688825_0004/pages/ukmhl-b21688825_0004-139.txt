OF THE LIVER. I07 the diaphragm, it is joined by two large veins from the liver, which, from their fize and form, being the re- turning veins of the liver, are termed in general the venae cavae hepaticse. Thefe veins fometimes pierce the diaphragm alongft with the cavae abdominaiis, fo that there is to be obferved one large perforation in the diaphragm, but generally they pafs the diaphragm clofe to the great vein, but fo that there are three openings in the diaphragm. When thefe hepatic veins are traced into the fubftance of the liver, they are feen to be gathered together from all parts of the liver in two, or fometimes three great branches. The communication betwixt the vena ports and the vens cavs hepaticse are fo free, that feveral anato- mifts have imagined a peculiar and more immediate communication of their branches than holds in other parts of the body betwixt the arteries and veins ; a circuinftance which appeared to them the more ne- ceflary, confidering the lefier impetus with which the blood flows in the vena ports than in .the arterial fyftem.

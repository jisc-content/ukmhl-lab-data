INTRODUCTION. 4 decline to feeblenefs and infirmities: and the more ra- pidly that animals advance in the firfl: ftage of their progrefs, fo is the proportion of their decline. But it is not in obferving the changes of the animal body from youth to age that the operations of the ceconomy are the mod interefiing. It is when we find the living body to confifl: of parts performing a variety of functions, and thefe conne&ed and mutually de- pendant ; when we fee the circulating fluid throwing put fluid and folid fecretions to build up and fupport the body, which is in inceflant and daily decay. Again, our admiration is ftrongly excited when we obferve the fyftem to confifl: of fluids and folids, and the exigence of the animal to depend upon the balance of their power; the fluids feparating and combining in new affinities, and forming the various fecretions; and the folids having a&ion, and that a&ion controlling the affinities and new combinations of the circulating fluids. We find that life fubfifts by the due a&ion of folids and fluids; or that an incomprehenfible influ- ence in a living body is exerted on the latter, and that the chemift can never fo combine the fluids out of the body as to imitate the changes produced in a living fyftem of fluids and vefiels. Forgetting that animation is the efiential character of living bodies, phyfiologifts have too much endeavoured in every age to explain the phenomena of animated nature by iftuftrations drawn from mechanics, chemiftry, pr hydraulics. In a body in which there is life there is a perpetual \vafte ; firft by fecretions, which for particular purpofes are thrown into the cavities, and afterwards carried opt of the body entirely by the excretions of the kidney, • th§

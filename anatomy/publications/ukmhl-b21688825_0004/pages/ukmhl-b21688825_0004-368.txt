Some- times it fplits, and again unites on the vertebrae of the back. Having pafled the arch of the aorta, it erodes to the left fide of the fpine, and we look for it under the pleura on the left fide of the cefophagus. The thoracic dud now emerges from the thorax, and lies deep in the lower part of the neck, behind the lower thyroid artery, and on the longus colli mufcle. It gets above the level of the fubclavean vein of the left fide, and here it receives the abforbents of the head and neck (of the left fide), and defeends again with a curve, and terminates in the angle of the union of the fubclavean vein and jugular vein of the left fide. Sometimes there are two thoracic duCts; but this is very rare. Sometimes the dud fplits near its termi- nation, and the two branches enter the veins feparately ; but, in general, when it fplits in this manner, it again unites before it terminates in the vein. There isconflantly a trunk in the anterior mediaflinum under the fternurn, as large as the thoracic duCl itfelf, which is fometimes inferted into the termination of the thoracic duCl; fometimes into the trunk of the abforb- ents of the left fide, to be immediately deferibed *. THE TRUNK OF THE ABSORBENTS OF THE RIGHT SIDE. The abforbents, from the right fide of the head and neck, and from the right arm, do not run acrofs the neck3 * Cruickfhanks.

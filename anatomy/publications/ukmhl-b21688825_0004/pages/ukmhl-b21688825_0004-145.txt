GP THE tIVER. dated Intervals, there feems to be a provifion for a quantity of bile being evacuated from the receptacle and duds proportioned to the food, and while it is palling the duodenum. Whether we fhould conceive that this is a neceffary confequence of the retention of the bile in the gall-bladder, or a wife provifion of nature, I am uncertain ; but it appears, that the longer the bile is retained, or the longer the fall and the de- ficiency of food in the duodenum, the more acrid and mfpiffated is the bile, and the greater alfo in quantity. This infpifiation of the bile takes place in confequence of the activity of the lymphatics, which ramifying on the coats abforb the thinner part of the bile. Further ; I cannot look upon the rugae and cellular firudure of the inner coat of the gall-bladder in any other light than as the means of increafing the furface, and expofing the bile to a further abforption of its watery parts than otherwife would take place. The gall-bladder is fuppofed by fome to be emptied by the general prefiure of the abdomen; an opinion founded on a miftake, which a very little confideration might corred. Others think that the ftomach, or duodenum, or colon, being diftended by the food, comprefs and empty the gall-bladder; while others with more apparent corrednefs allege, that it is emptied in confequence of a confent of parts. With the latter I would confidently affirm, that as the aliment paifes the duodenum, the bile follows apace, either from the alternate contradion and relaxation of the duodenum Â©ccafioning a relaxation of the orifice of the duds, or more probably from the duds being excited, as the falivary glands are excited by the prefence of fapid Vol. IV.

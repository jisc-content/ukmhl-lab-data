I70 STRUCTURE OF THE FENlS* OF THE URETHRA. The urethra is all that length of the canal from the neck of the bladder to the extremity of the penis. It is formed of the continuation of the inner and third coat of the bladder, which laft forms a reticular mem- brane, uniting the inner membrane to the fpongy body. It is, however, fupported through all its length, near the bladder, by palling through the proftate gland and fphindter fibres} further forward than this, where it partes from the proftate to the beginning of the fpongy body of the urethra, it is inverted and fup- ported by firm cellular and ligamentous membranes; and in the length of the penis it is included in the fpongy body, which extends from the bulb to the glans. It cannot be aefcribed as a cylindrical canal, for it ad- mits of very unequal diftention. It begins large at the neck of the bladder, where, immerfed in the proftate gland, it forms a little fmus; it is contra&ed again in a remarkable degree behind the bulb; it dilates into the sinus of the urethra within the bulbous en- largement of the fpongy body; it is gradually dimi* nifhed forward ; and it may be confidered as cylindri- cal forward to the point of the glans, where it is much contracted *, and where we often find calculi detained, which have parted the whole length of the canal. The canal of the urethra is bedewed with mucus. The fources of this mucus are here particularly appa- rent ; for, befides the general furface, there are large * Haller Com. lib. xxvib fe&- i. $ xxx.

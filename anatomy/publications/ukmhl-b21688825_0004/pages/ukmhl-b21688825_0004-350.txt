308 OF THE ABSORPTION OF SOI.IDS. laboured^ he ohferves, to explain abforption on th<? principle of capillary attraction, becaufe it was familiar ; but as they were dill under the neceffity of fuppofing aCtion in the veflels after the mattef was abforbed, they might as well have carried this aCtion to the mouths of thefe veflels. One never could have ventured to fuppofe the extra- vagant conclufion to which this idea, once entertained, has led Mr.Hunter.—He proceeds to confider the many kinds of folids the lymphatics have to carry away, and the variety of mouths in different animals, fuited to the great variety of fubflances they have to work upon, and then draws the conclufion, or leaves his reader to do fo; that not only are the mouths of the lymphatics calculated to abforb fluids ; not only do they carry away the folids, but each veflel, according to the hard- nefs and toughnefs of the material upon which it has to operate, has a mouth adapted for the work. Here we do not fee the genius of Hunter, but a poverty of imagination. Mr. Hunter takes the merit of a new doClrine relating to abforption.—He admits that oil, fat, and earth of bones had always been confldered as fubjeft to abforption ; and that forne other parts of the body liable to wafte had been fuppofed to fuffer by abforp- tion ; but that any folid part fhould be abforbed, he fuppofes to be entirely a new doftrine.—Now, I think we may venture to affirm, that not only was it known that folid parts of the body were taken away during life; but that phyflologifts knew each and every part of the living body to be undergoing a perpetual decay and renovation. Nay, we may venture further to fay, that Mr. Hunter did not comprehend, in its full extent, the

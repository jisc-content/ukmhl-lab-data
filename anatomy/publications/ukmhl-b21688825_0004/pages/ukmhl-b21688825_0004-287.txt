General and topical plethora are terms which have been of great fervice in explaining this periodical change in the female fyftem, but the ftate of mere fullnefs, has little effeft either on the conftitu- tionai or topical change. Even in the exhaufled and debilated ftate of che fyftem, when menftruation ceafes from the want of energy and power in the vafcular fyftem, ftill there remain the fame laws governing the fympathies, and relations of the feveral parts; and although they are feebly and imperfe&ly excited, they give rife to accumulated diftrefs at the period in which the menfes fhould flow.

With regard to vicarious haemorrhagy from remote parts of the body, fome, whofe opinion I greatly value, do not confider them as deviations of the menfes. At all events, from what I have feen of fuch haemorr- bagies (tumors, for example, difeharging blood at the menftrual periods), I would obferve, that there is an excitement, throbing, and diftenfion, previous to the difeharge of blood, which confirms me in the notion of the neceflity of a counter excitement and aftion, as well as the difeharge of blood, being necef- fary to make a derivation from the uterine vefiels.

In the firft place it is found, that the

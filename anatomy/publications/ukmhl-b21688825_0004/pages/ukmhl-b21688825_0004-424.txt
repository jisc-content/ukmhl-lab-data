I think I recollect a fimilar cafe occurring to Dr. Blake. In thofe tumors which arife from the alveoli and gums, filling the mouth with a cancerous mafs, and foftening the upper part of the jaw, there is no eradicating the difeafe but by taking away the whole adventitious part of the jaw which belongs to the teeth, and leaving only the firmer bafe* But even this operation will be too often unfuccefsful. When a tooth is loft, it appears as if the fpace it occupied were partly filled up by an increafed thicknefs of the adjacent teeth, and partly by the lengthening of that which is oppofite: indeed, this appearance has been brought as a proof of the continual growth of teeth. But there is a fallacy in the obfervation; for when the fpace appears to have become narrow by the approximation of the two adjacent teeth, it is not owing to any-increafe of their breadth, but to their moving from that fide where they are well fupported to the other fide where they are not. For this reafon they get an inclined dire&ion; and this inclination may be obferved in feveral of the adjoining teeth *. The tranfplanting of teeth prefents another very interefting phenomenon. A tooth recently drawn, and placed accurately into a focket from which one has been taken, will adhere there : nay, it will even adhere to any living part, as in the comb of a cock.

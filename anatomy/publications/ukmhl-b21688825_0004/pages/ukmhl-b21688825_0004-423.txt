381 07 THE TEETH. It is no proof of the firft fet being pufhed out by the fecond fet of teeth, that if the permanent teeth do not rife, the firft will remain, their roots unwafted and firm even to old age ; for ftill I contend that there is an agreement and coincidence betwixt the teeth in their changes, and alfo in the alveoli, by which they are furrounded; but this is not produced by the pref- fure of the rifing teeth. When a dentift fees a tooth feated out of the proper line, and draws it, and finds that he has made the miftake of extracting the adult tooth, letting the milk tooth remain, he mud not ex~ peÂ£t that the milk tooth will keep its place, for the contrary will happen, it will in general fall out. The old and the new teeth are lodged in diftin<5t compartments of the jaw-bone, and what is more curious, their alveoli are diftinCt, for as the roots of the firft teeth decay, their alveolar proceffes are ab- forbed, while again, as the new teeth rife from their deep feat in the jaw bone, they are accompanied with new alveoli*; yet thefe alveoli are not Sufficient to Support the teeth, for we find that the teeth will remain long perfeCl while they uniformly retain their relative pofition and number, but when one falls, the reft more quickly decay; and the chief art of the dentift in fhifring the feat of the teeth, is gradually to puffi them along the jaw notwithftanding thefe bony partitions and proceffes, fo as to bring them into equal and Seemly lines. No circumftance can better illuftrate how perfect the dependence of the alveoli is upon the teeth, than, that of their being thrown off with them in extenfive * Mr. Hunter. C c Vol. IV. exfolia-

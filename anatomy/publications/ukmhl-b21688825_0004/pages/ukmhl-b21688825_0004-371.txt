OF THE COURSE OF THE LYMPHATICS. 329 viz. that the mefenteric veins abforbed the chyle from the inteflines, and conveyed it to the liver, ftill prevailed. Even after the difcovery of the laCteals was known and received, a part of the old fyftem was ftill retained, and it was fuppofed that thofe veffels carried the fluids abforbed from the inteflines into the liver ; and that the fluids were there converted into blood. About twenty years after the difcovery of Afellius, Rudbeck, a Swede, and Bartholin, a Danifh anatornift, faw Afelliusâ€™s veffels in many other parts of the body ; difcovered the trunk of the fyftem, and fhowed that the lacleals did not pafs to the liver, but that they were branches of a great and diftincl fyftem ; they alfo de- monftrated the unity of this fyftem. We have feen from this fketch that the ancients fup- pofed the veins of the inteflines to be abforbents; and even after the difcovery of the la&eals, this idea has been detained bv foine of the belt modern anatomifts, and principally by Haller, and profdfor Mickel of Berlin. If the veins abforb from the furface of the inteflines, their doctrine would imply that they are alfo abforbents in general throughout the body. Although Bartholin, in his epiftle to Harvey, had afferted and given fufflcient proof that the mefenteric veins were not abforbents, yet the controverfy was left in fo un- decided a ftate, as to give occafion to the feries of experiments in the fchooi of the Hunters, which feems ' to have put the queftion to reft, in as far as it is con- nected with the lymphatic fyftem *. We have already mentioned that Afellius was em- ployed in opening the belly of a living dog, when he * See the veins in this volume. ^

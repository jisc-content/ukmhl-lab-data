t®I OF THE LIVER. Great right and left lobes of the liver.— The firft great divifion of the liver is marked on the convex furface by the broad ligament; which running ba k from the foffa umbilicalis divides it into the two great lobes, the right and left. When the concave furface of the liver is turned up, we fee the fame divi- fion into the right and left lobes by a fnTure which runs backwards. It is on this lower furface of the liver that we have to mark the greater variety of divifions in this vifcus. Farther, it is on the right lobe that thofe eminences are to be obferved, which, with the indentations and fulci, give fome intricacy to this fubjeff. Lobulus sfigelii *.—The lobulus fpigellii is be- twixt the two greater lobes, but rather belonging to the right great lobe. From its fituation deep behind, and from its having a particular papilla-like projeflion, it is called lobulus pofterior, or papillatus. To the left fide it has the fuTure for the lodgment of the duflus venofus; on the right, the fiffure for the vena cava ; and above, it has the great tranfverfe fiflure of the liver for the lodgment of the cylinder of the porta : obliquely to the right, and upwards, it has a connec- tion with the lower concave furface of the great lobe by the proceflus caudatus, which Window calls one of the roots of the lobulus fpigellii. It is received into the bofom of the leffer curve of the ftomach. Lobulus caudatus f.—This really deferves the name of proceffus caudatus, for it is like a procefs of • Lobulus pojlerior—-pojl'icus—papcllfltus. *f Procdlus caudatus. H] the

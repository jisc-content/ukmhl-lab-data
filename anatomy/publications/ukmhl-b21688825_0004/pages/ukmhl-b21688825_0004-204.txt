-172 STRUCTURE OF THE PENIS. rounded with ftrong fibres and a fpongy body, which conjointly feem calculated for every purpofe of the ceconomy, and likely to account for every fymptom which might be miftaken for fpafmodic aCtion in the canal itfelf. The idea of mufcularity is derived from the fymptoms of ftriCture and irritability of the canal. I fhall therefore, in the firft place, fhew how I con- ceive ftriCture is produced. The urethra is very elaftic; not only allowing a very large bougie to be paffed, and clofing upon a thread, but it ftill more remarkably admits of elongation than of diftention in the width of the canal. It is fur- rounded, as we have feen, with a fpongy body and the cellular coat which is betwixt the delicate lining mem- brane of the urethra, and the fpongy body partakes of the ftruCture of both, and is very elaftic. But when an inflammation attacks the canal, this cellular membrane is its principal feat. The point affeCted lofes its elafticity ; no longer ftretches with the penis and urethra, but confolidates, and throws the inner membrane into a fold in a di- rection acrofs the canal. Thus the membrane at A has con- tracted and condenfed in copfequence of inflammation, or rather, when contracted, by the fhrinkipg of the urethra in length and its fpongy body has formed an adhefton, and. In confluence of inflamma- tion^ has loft its elafticity and no longer dilates in the pro- portion

AND OF THE DOCTRINE OF ABSORPTION. 303 The chief proof of the lymphatic abforption has been derived from the manner in which the venereal virus is received into the fyftem. Venereal matter being allowed to lodge upon the-delicate fkin of the glans penis or preputium, caufes an ulcer there. The mat- ter of this ulcer is abforbed by the lymphatic of the part; an inflamed line is fometimes to be traced into the groin ; and the lymphatic gland of the groin receiving this abforbed matter, inflames and forms the bubo. Here, then, is a proof that the red veins do not abforb, and that lymphatics do: elfe why are they inflamed,—and why are the lymphatic glands inflamed to fuppuration. We mull obferve, however, that this is by no means an abfolute proof of abforption ; nor is there here unequivocal evidence of venereal matter having been abforbed. Although, therefore, we believe in the gene- ral fyltem, we may hazard thefe queries :—If this matter is abforbed, why is there no infection without ulcer (chancre) of the glands? If this ulcer be produced by abforption, how comes it that the conftitution is not infedted by the firfl abforption of the matter, and before it has formed an ulcer ? Is it not probable that the irri- tation of the venereal matter, lodging on this vafcular furface, and without being abforbed, caufcs a peculiar inflammation, the tendency of which is to form a puftule, and to produce matter fimilar to that which originally infedted the part with the fpecific and peculiar adlion ? Again it will be faid, however the venereal puflule was originally produced, it appears evident that the abforption of this matter, the conveying of it along the lymphatic, inflames the veflfel, and the next X 2 lymphatic

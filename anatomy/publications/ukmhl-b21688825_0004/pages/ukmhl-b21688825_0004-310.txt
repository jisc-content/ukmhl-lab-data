268 O? THE VfOMB. formed by the uterus. On the furface attached to the womb, the placenta exhibits deep and irregular fiffiires which divide it into lobes; but on the inner furface is fmooth from the inverting membranes, but raifed into irregularities by the numerous and tortuous ramifications of the umbilical veflels. When rudely torn or cut into, it appears to be a fpongy fubftance, formed in a great part of an irregular tiflue of veflels. In the human fubjett we find, that the maternal part of the placenta is thrown off with the other fecun- dines, and does not feparate from the foetal part of it. While, in other viviparous animals, the monkey ex- cepted, the filamentous extremities of the foetal veflels feparate from the glandular mafs formed by the mater- nal veflels of the uterus. * The placentary veflels of the foetus never touch the furface of the womb, but communicate with the ma- ternal fyftem through the veflels of the womb, which pierce the deciduous membrane. Still the queftion of the precife manner in which the veflels of the foetus communicate with thofe of the mother remains unde- termined. I conceive that in the early ftage the deci- duous membrane being thrown out by the a&ion of the uterine veflels, thofe of the chorion ftretch into it, and abforb the nourilhment. The decidua is avafcular mem- brane, but it has, at the fame time, a peculiar fpongy texture. This fpongy, or reticulated ftrudture of la- mina of the decidua ceafes where the placenta is af- fixed. When we carefully difleQ: up the decidua to the margin of the placenta, it is found to be be more 9 rigid

OF THE ABDOMEN. 39 pelvis) have mufcular coats, and the power of con- tracing their cavities; while the liver, fpleen, pancreas, and kidnies, have no mufcularity but in their veffels and excretory duds. This divifion of the vifcera may lead to important diftindions in pathology. During inflammation, it is obferved, that though the. parrs poffeffing a power of; contradion may fometimes lie inadive without pain, yet in thofe parts when roufed to adion there is excru- ciating pain. On the other hand, it often happens that the glandular and folid vifcera are the feat of long con- tinued difeafe, which is attended only with a dull or low degree of pain ; while the anatomifl is often {truck upon examining the body after death with the wide, ravages of the difeafe. We divide the inteftinal canal into three parts; the ilomach, the fmall inteftines, the great inteftines. The fmall inteftines are fubdivided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileon. The great inteftines are fubdi- vided into the caecum, colon, and rectum. The fto- mach is the feat of the digeftive procefs : in the duo- denum the food receives the addition of the fecretions from the liver and pancreas, and is ftill further adapted to animalization ; in the long trad of the jejunum and ileon the nutricious part is abforbed ; and in the great inteftines the effete matters are carried {lowly forward, and at the fame time fuller a further abforption of their fluid contents, until as fceces they lodge in the redutn or laft divtfton of the canal. From this view it is apparent that as each divifion of the inteftinal canal is marked by feme peculiarity in its ufe or fundiop, we mud carefully examine their D 4 minute

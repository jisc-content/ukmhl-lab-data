The incifores of the upper jaw are larger and ftronger; thofe of the lower jaw are final ler, neater, and for the mod part evenly fet, while the teeth of the upper jaw are more frequently irregular from being crowded together. The cufpidatif are four in number, one lateral to the incifores of each jaw. They are flronger than the lad in their form; thicker at their bafe: in the gum more convex forward, and terminate with a notched central point. In general, and particularly in the lower jaw, they project further than the other teeth ; their roots are fingle and long; they (land betwixt the inci- fores and grinders in form as in place, for they feeni neither perfeftly adapted to cut like the incifores, nor for grinding. “ We may trace in thefe teeth,” fays Mr. Hunter, <c a fimilarity in fhape, fituation, and ufes from the mod imperfect carnivorous animal which we believe to be the human fpecies, to the mod perfect carnivorous animal, the lion.” Next in order from thefymphyfis of the jaw rife the bicufpides, the fourth and fifth teeth. Thefe are eight in number, and accurately refemble each other. Taking one, we may obferve that it is flattened laterally, anfwering to the flat fide of the root, and that it ter- minates in two acute points: the internal of thefe points, even when not worn down, is the lead. The fecond bicufpes is often wanting. The bicufpides are very often called the anterior grinders. Their roots are Angle, or appear like two fangs united j or the fird bicufpes has in general two fmall fangs, or is rather * Dentes canini, the eye teeth, from their place of original lodgement in the upper jaw. forked}

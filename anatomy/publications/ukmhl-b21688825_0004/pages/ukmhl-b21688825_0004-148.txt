OF THE LIVER. i 16 with a delicate membrane, the continued peritoneum. It retains the character of peritoneum, in being a fimple membrane, whitifh, and a little pellucid. In this mem- brane minute arteries and veins ramify, which are un- connedted with the internal fyflem of veflels, and in the clofe cellular membrane beneath it the lymphatic veflels take their courfe. When a fedtion is made of the liver, the veflels may be thus diftinguifhed: the dudts by the thicknefs of their coats, and their yellow colour; the arteries by a lefs degree of thicknefs, and a more refilling elaflicity ; the branches of the vena portae and the cava hepaticae by the thinnefs of their coats, of which thofe of the latter are conflderably the weaker. With the invefliture of the peritoneal coat of the liver even the vafcular tiffue of the body of the liver has no communication by veflels *. It is therefore con- fidered as an organ of a peculiarly diflindt organization. By the proofs from anatomical injedtions we are in- formed, that there is a free intercourfe through the extreme branches of all the five fyltems of veflels in the liver. From minute injections, and the trying and making of fedtions in the liver, there feems no likelihood of gaining information of the ftrudture and connedtions of thefe veflels. Walther, who feems to have examined more methodically and minutely than any other anato- milt in any age, could make no diftindtion of parts. In whatever way he made his fedtions, whatever fyflem of veflels he filled, whether the whole veflels or each feparately, he could not afcertain the diredtion and * Soemmering.

OF THE TESTES. 1§4 In this change the tefticles do not fall loofe into the elongation of the peritoneum like a piece of gut or omentum in a rupture;—but, carrying the perito- neum with them, they continue to adhere to the parts behind them, as they did to the pfoas mufcle while in the loins: a point of importance to be recolle&ed by the young furgeon. The communication betwixt the belly and the fac of the vaginalis is very foon obliterated by the adhefion of the upper part, and then the whole extent of the paflage (viz. from E to D, in plan 3d of this feries,) is fhut. When this procefs is prevented in the firft inftance, when nature is baulked in the humour of do* * ing her work, as Mr. Hunter obferves, Ihe can not fo eafily do it afterwards. It has alfo occurred that, this communication re- maining after birth, a hydrocele has been produced by the diftention of the tunica vaginalis, by fluids de- scending from the belly. The charadler of fuch a tu- mour will be, that the fluid will be eafily forced into the belly. It may, however, be miltaken for a con- genital hernia *, It will already be underftood, that in the common hernia of the groin or fcrotum, the gut does not pafs by the communication from the belly into the vaginal the tefticle, and that thofe who have the tefticle remaining in the belly have it imperfett or {mall. This is contrary to an old authority :—The tefticles are feated externally, “ for chaftity’s “ fake, for fuch live-wights as have their (tones hid within their body, are very lecherous, do often couple, and get “ many young ones.” * Such is the remark of Mr. Hunter. 6 coat ;

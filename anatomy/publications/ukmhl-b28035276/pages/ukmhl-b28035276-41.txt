All readers of Hunter will recollect the account of the seizure in which he noticed that his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing had stopped, and in which he resorted to voluntary motions of respiration, since “ it struck him ” that if he did not “ he should have died”—though on reflecting afterwards on the matter, he thinks he might not have died after all.* Few can think, without admiring wonder, on the courage and devotion of a man who could thus coolly watch his own mortal agonies and use them for the benefit of the science which he loved. A much lighter affliction befell Hunter when he rup- tured his tendo Achillis in dancing. The confine- ment necessitated by this accident he used for the study of the process of union in tendons, and for * This seizure is twice described: once in the ‘ Treatise on the Blood, &c., vol. iii, p. 193, and again more fully in the ‘ Lectures on Surgery,’ vol. i, p. 244.

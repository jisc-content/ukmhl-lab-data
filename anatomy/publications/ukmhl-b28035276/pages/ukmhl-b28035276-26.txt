But all his money went into his museum, to the extent, Mr. Marshall tells us, of £70,000; and even after his death it continued to absorb all his available re- sources, so that his library, his country house, his collections of works of art, all had to be sold in order to keep the museum in saleable condition, while Mrs. Hunter and her two children were sup- ported by “the King’s Bounty,” a fund analogous to the civil list of the present day, but only available for two years. Another point from which we must view the life of Hunter on this occasion is as a member of this School.

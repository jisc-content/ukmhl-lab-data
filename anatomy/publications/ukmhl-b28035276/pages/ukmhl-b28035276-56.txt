50 INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. to resolve itself into a mere metaphor, as the stimulus of imperfection.* The strange expression, “ the stimulus of death,” is due to the error of regarding the rigor mortis as a vital not a lethal change.! And yet, when he uses the term in its natural and true signification, what vivacity and picturesqueness it gives to his exposition, and how plainly it brings out the point to which his reasoning is intended to conduce ! And so with sympathies. Much that Hunter says about sympathy is metaphorical merely, much is a re-statement of facts under the guise of ex- planation. Yet some of the most valuable sections on general pathology are those which deal with sympathy — notably the most interesting tenth chapter of the 4 Surgical Lectures,’ the perusal of which I should be disposed to recommend to one who had not the time “ to steep himself ” in Hunter, as the best sample of Hunter’s style as a writer on surgery. But, after all, with Hunter, as with every great author, “to steep yourself in him” is the only way really to appreciate him. In these days of “ abstracts ” and “ extracts ” we have but too * He is speaking (cbap. v of the ‘Lectures on Surgery’) of the absorption of useless parts, and he says, “ When the part to be absorbed is alive it must feel its own inefficacy and admit of absorp- tion. The vessels must have the stimulus of imperfection of this part, as if they were sensible that this part were unfit, therefore take it up.” f Green (‘Hunterian Oration,’ 1840, p. 84) has tried to defend Hunter’s use of these terms, but to my apprehension not very successfully.

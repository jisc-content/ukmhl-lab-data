46 INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. those who deny all force in the argument from design, and who remain quite unaffected by Paley’s celebrated illustration of the watch. In fact it has now become almost a requisite of tlie highest cul- ture to adopt and put into more elaborate phrase- ology Topsy’s simple theory of her origin, “ I ’spect I grow’d. Don’t think nobody never made me.” Yet somehow, in spite of science “ entangling itself in overwiseness,” in spite of the difficulty of assign- ing uses to parts which have all the appearance of survivals from disused types, and in spite of the still more startling thought that all these elaborate machines are wound up only that they may run down, most people are as firmly teleological as Hunter was, and think that these exquisite arrange- ments were made in order to fulfil the designs for which they are so indubitably fitted. It is a tendency which is inevitable, because it is natural, and natural, I believe, because it is true. Anyhow, Hunter is entirely teleological.* He died too for instance, is started in Diderot’s ‘ Letter on the Blind for the use of those who can see,’ where it is put in the mouth of the blind Sanderson. The relation in which the hypothesis stands to that of Darwin may be thus expressed: the old philosopher insists on the survival of the fit, Darwin on the survival of the fittest. What a vast diffei’ence underlies the apparent similarity in the introduction of a single short syllable scarcely needs to be pointed out.” The whole of this Introduction, where it treats on necessity and teleology, will well repay the reader’s perusal and best attention. The great founder of natural science, though admitting the force of the necessitarian argument to some extent, was for all practical purposes a teleologist. * Abernethy takes the same view in his comments on Hunter’s physiology (see his ‘ Phys. Lect.,’ pp. 70, 151, 153, &c.).

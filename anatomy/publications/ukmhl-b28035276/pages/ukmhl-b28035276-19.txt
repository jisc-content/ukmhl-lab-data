INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 13 Then lie saw his patients or pursued his researches till he had to go his rounds to the hospital, or to his office of Surgeon General, or his patients in the city, and after his frugal dinner at four o’clock and an hour’s sleep he resumed his labours or went to some scientific meeting till midnight brought the day to an end. This constant work and want of sleep probably shortened his days, and was, in Dr. Ridge’s opinion,* the exciting cause of the angina which carried him off. But I have no doubt that this method of life was for him the happiest,! for it kept him always thinking, and thinking was the great joy of his life. He had other joys too. As I said, in his younger days he seems to have been fond of company, he had some taste for the fine arts,:}: and so on; but as life wore on, and as he saw plainly enough by repeated warnings that it could not be a long one, with endless unsolved questions ever rising in his mind, with his museum ever growing and opening out into new vistas of research as every fresh addition was made to it, and with even his one great book—that on the Blood * Ridge, J., ' Observations on the Life, Disease, and Death of John Hunter,’ 1855. t “ His whole life was a series of incessant labour, or rather of delightful occupation; for it was spent in pursuits to which he was devoted, heart and soul. The only relaxation was that afforded by change of employment.”—Lawrence, ‘ Hunterian Oration.’ x “ Mr. Hunter was particularly fond of drawings and paintings. There was no poor artist of talent in this town that he did not befriend to the utmost of his powers.”—Abernetby, ‘ Phys. Lect.,’ p. 192.

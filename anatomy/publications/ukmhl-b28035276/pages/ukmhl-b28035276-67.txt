61 INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. provide. We must recollect also that the value of the collection was so far from obvious to statesmen that even so distinguished a naturalist and so warm a friend of Hunter as Banks thought of it as not “ an object of importance to the general study of natural history, or indeed to any branch of science except that of medicine.” * Had it not been for Lord Auckland’s powerful advocacy there is no doubt that the transaction would have fallen through—and that advocacy was based of course on personal friendship, not on any knowledge of the treasure thus secured to the nation. How differ- ently do we now view the Hunterian museum. It is, indeed, thanks to the liberal and wise manage- ment of it by the College, in a very different condi- tion from that in which its great author left it. And this is one of Hunter’s great glories. Rich as are the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which he himself gave to men, they are poor in comparison with the method which he initiated, and by following which his successors have endowed the world with # Ottley’s * Life,’ p. 141. So again, Abernethy says that Cuvier “ declared that he knew not that there was such a collection as the Hunterian museum.” It was perhaps better known to Hunter’s own professional friends, for we are told by Sir R. Owen that in 1787, “ when he had brought his museum to an approximate degree of perfection, he then set apart certain days in which he exhibited and explained to some chosen minds, which could respond to the concep. tionB of his own, his great scheme, embracing the demonstration of all the leading modifications of every organ of the animal body, and of the different stages which each organ undergoes in its deve- lopment to fulfil the functions it is required to perform in the highest organisms.”—(Preface, p. xxxviii.)

But I willingly avoid any reference to “ the vivisection controversy,” and turn to the last of my topics. We come now to the greatest of Hunter’s works, the great museum, which was the chief occupation of his last thirty years to collect, at which he worked every day and every night, to which he sacrificed every guinea, as well as every moment that he could spare; which was intended to embody, to be the visible pre- sentment of, the theory of the action of life in health and disease, that he had formed with such infinite labour and such indomitable perseverance. Well, indeed, does Abernethy (‘ Phys. Lect.,’ p 27) call it “ the great labour of his life—the principal record * “ To be still more certain of the nature of what these vesiculae contain than was possible from the examination of bodies which had been dead some time I took an opportunity of opening a man immediately after his death who had been killed by a cannon-ball.” —(‘ On the Glands called Vesicul® seminales,’ vol. iv, p. 21.) f He inferred the passage of air through animal membranes partly from some experiments performed by him when house surgeon at St. George’s.—(‘ Treatise on the Blood,’ &c., vol. iii, p. 84.) J I have often devised experiments by the fireside or in my carriage, and have also conceived the result; but when I tried the experiment the result was different, or I found that the experiment could not be attended with all the circumstances that were sug- gested.”—‘ Observations on Bees,’ vol. iv, p. 424.

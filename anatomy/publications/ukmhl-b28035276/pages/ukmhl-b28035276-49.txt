He was conscious of this himself, and writes to a friend, while the second edition of the ‘ Treatise on the Venereal Disease ’ was in prepara- tion, “ In order to render the language intelligible, I meet a committee of three gentlemen,* to whose correction every page is submitted.” Whether it would have been good or bad for Hunter himself had he spent more time in school learning may be doubtful, but that it would have been a good thing for his readers if he had been able to express him- self plainly no one can question.! But even though Hunter had to struggle with a literary incapacity which prevented him from making clear to others the meaning of his thoughts, and though we are justified in believing along with some of his most sincere and most ardent admirers and scholars that those thoughts were often not perfectly clear to his own mind, yet in many cases the further progress of science has cleared up dark places in Hunter’s * Babington tells us that the three were Sir G. Blanc, Dr. Fordyce, and Dr. Pitcairn, to whom a Mr. Marshall was afterwards joined. He also says that their efforts did not produce much result. t Of the many discussions of this matter, none, I think, is more lucid or more satisfactory than Sir W. Savory’s in his Hunterian Oration, p. 26, “ I confess that to me it seems the education, of whatever kind, must indeed be a bad one, which is not better than none at all. My conviction is that if Hunter had received a good general education in early years he would have been all the better for it. He would have lost nothing. His mental powers could have been no way impaired, but, on the contrary, enhanced. He would have recorded the results of his labours in better order, with more light and greater effect; and we should have had the advantage of a clearer revelation of his thoughts.”

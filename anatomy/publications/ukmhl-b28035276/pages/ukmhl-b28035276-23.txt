17 INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. songs she wrote, “ My Mother bids me bind my Hair,” was set to Haydn’s music, and is still a favourite; and at his country house at Earl’s Court (of which our friend Mr. Roberts has pre- served for us so faithful a picture) Hunter seems to have had all that he wanted to make life pleasant. There he could take what repose he chose to afford himself from the constant distractions of London practice, and that repose consisted largely in fol- lowing out his observations in natural history, among the numerous inhabitants of the menagerie he kept in his house and garden; studying the habits of bees and the functions of plants or making series of experiments on eggs, both for embryo- logical purposes and to illustrate his theory of life. Partly also he enjoyed family life and a little quiet society, and the rupture of his tendo Achillis shows that at the age of forty he had not outlived the Scottish taste for dancing. All that we know of Hunter’s personal habits seems to me to show him as a kindly, humorous man, rough, it may be, in his language (but that was far from peculiar in those days), rough also in his temper, and very eager (as his brother was also) in the defence of his rights in his discoveries, which he prized above all other things ; but a fast friend, sympathetic and helpful to his friends in trouble,* * A pleasant anecdote is recorded how Hunter offered his friend Lynn a loan of £'200 when he was labouring under a long illness from syphilitic infection contracted in a post-mortem examination.

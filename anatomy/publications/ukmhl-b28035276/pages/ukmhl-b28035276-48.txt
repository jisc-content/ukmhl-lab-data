INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 42 man of what is commonly called little education, i.e. he had not much school learning. Hardly a letter of his is preserved in which there are not gross errors in spelling, and often they are so negligently ex- pressed as to be quite unintelligible. I shall not stay to consider whether this want of education was a good or a bad thing for him—it was a necessity. He did not choose to study when he was young, and afterwards he had other things to do. But I would say, with Le Grros Clark (£ Hunterian Oration,’ p. 27), “I cannot persuade myself that he did not really and deeply regret the wasted time and unemployed talents which marked his career till manhood overtook him.” It would seem as if, at one time, he or his friends contemplated his entering the profession as a physician, since in 1753 his name was entered as a gentleman com- moner at St. Mary’s Hall, Oxford; but Hunter hated the notion of “ stuffing Latin and Greek at the University,” as he expressed it, and he never resided after his first term of six weeks. The result of this defective education was that he had not enough command of language to be certain of ex- pressing his meaning. There are passages of much force and beauty in his writings, his general style has distinction and power of its own, but he is often hopelessly obscure, and sometimes when his period when he little suspected their ultimate fate, that we owe our additional knowledge of the philosophical views which Hunter entertained of the application of anatomical facts, and of the general principles which he had deduced from them.”—(Pref., p. xxxix.)

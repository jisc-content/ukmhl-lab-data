INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 1G knew him thoroughly, like Clift and William Bell* and Jonner, remained tenderly attached to him, and he had those sterling qualities which win and keep the affections of such men. He was indifferent to money, and far too deeply penetrated with the love of higher things to care for places and titles. So he lived poor, though he earned a large income, and died so poor that his widow could not pay the expense of a monument to him in Westminster Abbey. It was left for the enthusiasm of our generation, under the guidance of a good and loyal St. George’s man—our lamented friend Frank Buckland—to supply the omission. And had it not been that the Government, which had shortly before refused with contempt the offer of the gift of William Hunter’s Museum, was persuaded to pur- chase that of John Hunter, his family would have been penniless; for amongst Hunter’s virtues that of making provision for those dependent on him was wanting. The purchase, however, was made, and so the long widowhoodf of Anne Hunter was not passed in penury. Hunter’s family life seems to have been happy and even gay. His wife was a woman of grace and accomplishments. One of the # Bell, who was engaged to stay in Hunter’s house for ten years, remained fourteen, apparently out of pure love for the work and for its master. f It is mentioned in Chevalier’s ‘ Hunterian Oration,’ 1821, that Mrs. Hunter had died on January 7 of that year in the seventy- ninth year of her age, having survived her husband more than twenty-seven years.

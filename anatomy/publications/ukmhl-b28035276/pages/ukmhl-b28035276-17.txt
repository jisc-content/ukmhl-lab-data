INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 11 brother’s anatomical labours and continued to do so after his House Surgeoncy; but in 1759 he was attacked with pulmonary symptoms, of which an elder brother had died; so he was recommended a change of climate. He applied for a post in the Army, was made Staff Surgeon, and went in 1761 to the Siege of Belle Isle and afterwards to the Peninsula, returning in 1763, when he settled in London. He was elected F.R.S. in 1767 and Surgeon to St. George’s in 1768, and in 1772 married Anne, the sister of Sir E. Home. He rose rapidly in public estimation, was made Deputy- Surgeon General to the Army in 1786, and Surgeon General in 1789 ; but is said by his biographers to have been long in obtaining a lucrative practice. The later part of his life, from 1773, was tormented by illness, and be had many severe fits of angina pectoris before the one which carried him off. This was in a dispute at the hospital about the terms on which pupils were to be received. Something said to him by one of his colleagues produced a fit of violent anger, in which he expired on October 16th, 1793. We have ample information about Hunter’s life from the early Hunterian orators who were his friends and pupils, from the sympathetic bio- graphies of Home, Ottley, and others, and from can read Mr. Holden’s ‘Hunterian Oration’ without admitting the high probability that Hunter may have had some anatomical instruction before joining his brother’s dissecting-room, but there is no proof of the fact.

It is, however, difficult to fix Hunter’s exact place in surgery, for his claims depend as much on what he suggested and originated as on what he actually accomplished. “ It may be said that nearly all the advances that have been made in surgery since the time of John Hunter may be found fore- shadowed, or suggested, or actually adopted in his writings, experiments, and practice.”* I must now speak as well as I can in the time at my disposal of Hunter’s writings on natural philo- sophy. These are contained in the fourth volume of Palmer’s edition, as edited by Sir R. Owen. I need not enumerate them. They are of the most varied nature, and one at least of them ought to be classed among the surgical. I mean the tract ‘ On the Recovery of Drowned Persons,’ which has the great merit, so common in Hunter’s writings, of seizing the essential truth of the matter, which in this in- stance is that “ in recovering persons drowned, the principal effect depends upon air being thrown into the lungs.” Most of these papers have been collected and published by their author in a book entitled ‘ Animal (Economy.’ Many persons regard this work as the most valuable of Hunter’s writings, and the one time of Hunter our profession has no longer been confined within the narrow limits of a practical art; assisted by his labours it has acquired a new character, has assumed a more elevated form, and has expanded itself to a science.” * Power, ‘ Hunterian Oration,’ p. 4.

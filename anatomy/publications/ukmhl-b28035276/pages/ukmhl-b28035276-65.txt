Owen tells us that Hunter left original records of the dissection of 315 different species of animals, and preparations of nearly 200 others, so that he had dissected animals of over 500 different species, besides his preparations in human anatomy and pathology, those which illustrate health and disease in plants,* and his geological and palaeontological specimens. We may safely say that no man since the world began has ever left so splendid a monument of well-directed and skilful labour. For Hunter was no bungler and no dilettante. He was a most accomplished dis- sector,! and as a natural philosopher he knew, as fewr men have ever known, the aim, the central point of his theories, and therefore, to what end his labour should be directed, and from that he never swerved. That point wras to show' how life worked in all ani- mated nature, how it had worked in times past in building up this universe, how it wras affected by cosmical conditions, by injury, and by disease. It almost makes one shudder to think how easily the great result of all this genius and labour might have perished.

Lect..’ pp. t>2 et seq. f Mr. Power says in his ‘Hunterian Oration,’ “The museum proves that he possessed dexterity of manipulation in perfection, and such specimens as those I now show might be pitted for delicacy of dissection against those of any other anatomist.”

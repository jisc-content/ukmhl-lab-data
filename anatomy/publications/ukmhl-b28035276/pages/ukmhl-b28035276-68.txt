INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 62 so much wider a biology, and so much truer and more progressive an art of medicine. So with the museum. It now contains far more than the number of preparations left by Hunter; it is ar- ranged on a plan which he himself indicated,* and which would have rejoiced his heart—it is the most magnificent instrument for the study of nature which exists in the world, and is one of the glories of the nation and of the city which possesses it. But though the greater part of the Hunterian Museum is in one sense not the handiwork of Hunter, the whole is so in a far higher sense—for it is by merely following his initiative that men, far inferior to him in genius, have built up this grand national monument. Many of the largest depart- ments are merely expansions or continuations of the series which Hunter began.f Thus the ethno- logical collection of crania, which has taken such * “ The simplicity of his object,” says Abernethy (‘ Phys. Lect.,’ p. 10), “ induced an almost equal simplicity of arrangement. The facts are displayed in his museum according to the order of the vital processes.” f Holden (‘ Hunterian Oration,’ 1881, p. 31) says as to the Hun- terian Museum: “ If he could enter it, after an absence from the earth of eighty-seven years, I do not know whether he would be more pleased at finding it so little altered, or at its having been so much enlarged. It is true that one section—that of stuffed birds—has disappeared altogether. It is true that some sections have been so much enlarged that he would hardly recognise them. There are 3000 specimens of skulls in the place of his 50, and his pathological specimens have been more than doubled. But in the series of comparative physiology, on which he bestowed the most pains, he would see the very materials which he gathered with his own hands to lay the bi*oad foundations of his new science still in the same order in which he placed them; he would see his own arrangement

INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 21 part in the fray. Those who did so were Bromfield, Gunning, Walker, and T. Keate.* They seem to have regarded Hunter as more of a physiologist and philosopher than a surgeon, and had no great re- spect for him in those provinces. In fact, I think it was one of them who profanely said of the Hun- terian Museum that it was “ of no more use than so many pigs’ pettitoes.” On the other hand, Hunter regarded them—and unfortunately did not hesitate to speak of them in no measured terms—as routine practitioners, hardly fit to teach surgery, because they had never learnt it; useless and lazy in the school, and envious of those whom they could not appreciate. One fact comes out, I think, clearly from the accounts we have received of this fatal quarrel, viz. that Hunter was a zealous and successful clinical teacher, while his opponents were the reverse. He is reported to have been a dull and ineffective lec- turer, and his formal lectures were never largely * Thomas Keate, uncle to the distinguished surgeon Robert Keate. who was the senior member of the staff in my early student days, is said in the ‘ Dictionary of Biography ’ to have been “ un- punctual and negligent in bis hospital duties.” But he seems to have followed Hunter’s practice in aneurism, as he was the first, according to Guthrie, to tie the subclavian for aneurism. Bromfield also, though he wrote in depreciation of Hunter’s operation, was present at a similar operation successfully performed by his own son. Mem.—Keate’s case is described summarily, and without date, by Guthrie (‘ Wounds and Injuries of Arteries,’ 1846, p. 40). It was a ligature of what we should call the first part of the axillary. Ramsden, in 1809, was the first to tie the subclavian above the clavicle.

INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 52 the first who tried to carry it out into practice, and who not only tried, but succeeded as far as any one man could succeed in his short working life of little more than forty years. This is a service to the whole human race, a revolution in thought such as it is given to only a very few men of the highest genius to originate, and in comparison with which errors in detail or failures in logical method appear as unimportant as are the minute perturbations which interfere with the perfect regularity of a planet’s orbit. But beside his great achievement, that of start- ing the world on a course of ever-increasing know- ledge and improvement, Hunter made enormous advances by his own unassisted labour.* If you look in Buckle’s great work, you will find a long list of the discoveries which are ascribed to him as original. Sir J. Paget more prudently abstains from pronouncing on Hunter’s claim to each of these discoveries, for some are contested, and probably some were made about the same time by Hunter and some contemporary (as that of the air-cells in birds’ bones by Hunter and Camper), and therefore, as Sir J. Paget says, “it would re- quire a careful study of the literature of the period in an effort to destroy morbific material in order to save the sick man.” * “Bacon, we know, has been compared to Moses on Pisgah surveying the promised land, and Newton to Joshua, who began to take possession of it. But Hunter saw the Canaan of surgery and took possession of it too.”—(Savory, ‘ Hunterian Oration.’)

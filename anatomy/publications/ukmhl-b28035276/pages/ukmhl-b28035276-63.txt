He was a great anatomist, but he has told us in his own simple way how good it was for him that he never devoted himself to anatomical teaching, “ as the necessity I should have been under to read might have occu- pied me too much and prevented ray forming habits or established modes of thinking.”* He was a great pathologist, but pathology was, after all, only one of the departments, and that one of the smaller, of the great science of life which it was his grand aim to found; and hence the pathological specimens, though numerous and important, are but a small minority of the contents of the museum.f Again, Hunter was a great zoologist, and the bulk of his * ‘Lectures on Surgery,’ p. 210. He used anatomy as anatomy ought to be used, as the handmuid of physiology. “ When,” says Abernethy (‘ Phys. Lect.,’ p. 58), “ he met with an animal he had never dissected he cared little by what name it was called, to what family it belonged, with what others it was associated, either by natural or artificial ties.

49 INTRODUCTORY" ADDRESS. Absorption, again,* he typifies as “ the natural surgeon ” to whom he attributes intention and a definite and even artistic mode of working; and so on, in a thousand instances. Closely connected with this tendency to personi- fication is the use which Hunter makes of “ stimuli ” and “ sympathies.” Looked at philosophically, per- haps these terms might be said to have little mean- ing—to stand merely as more or less metaphorical re-statements of the facts they are alleged to explain. Yet they serve the attentive reader well. They introduce so many pathological facts, so many practical observations, that we could ill afford to dispense with them. Stimulus is defined by Hunter f as “ the immediate cause of action in an animal a perfect definition, yet one which might justify his hatred of definitions, J for it certainly does not fit into his own use of the term. Sometimes that term figures as a veil for our ignorance of the whole matter, as when he says that this or that is produced by the stimulus of necessity, or of nature. Some- times it applies more to the mind than the body, as the stimulus of want or hunger—sometimes it seems other is thinned for the relief of the part.”—{* On the Blood, &c.,’ vol. iii, p. 478.) * See the ‘ Treatise on the Blood, &c.,’ part ii, chap, vi, §§ 7, 8, pp. 481, 482. t ‘ Croonian Lectures,’ p. 197. t “ 01 all things on the face of the earth definitions are the most cursed, for if you make a definition you may bring together under it a thousand things that have not the least oonnexion with it.”— (‘ Principles of Surgery,’ p. 217.) 4

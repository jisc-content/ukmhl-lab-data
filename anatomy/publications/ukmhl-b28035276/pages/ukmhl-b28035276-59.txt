53 INTIlODUCTORY ADDRESS. to enable one to form a definite opinion on each question.” Sir R. Owen speaks with similar wise caution on this subject in his preface to Hunter’s ‘ Animal (Economy ’ (p. iv), and in his notes to each paper in that work. He truly says that many of Hunter’s so-called “ discoveries ” were so in the sense that “ he doubtless did discover (the matter in question) so far as an independent and original research constitutes a claim to that honour,” though similar results might, without his know- ledge, have been arrived at independently. But there are many which are incontestable, and they prove that Hunter was by far the greatest physiolo- gist of his time. Then he was much more, for his far-reaching method dealt with life, not only in the present, but in the past; and his researches in geo- logy and paleontology carried him far along a road then untrodden, but which since his time has been opened out as one of the main avenues to a know- ledge of the genesis of heaven and earth.* His * Travers says, in his 4 Hunterian Oration,’ “ Even of that sub- lime science of these our days, which connects the history of our planet with that of its extinct races, which has based their classifi- cation on the anatomical correspondence and uniformity of design manifest in the organic remains of periods remotely antecedent to the creation of man and the existing types of mortality, it is indis- putable that Hunter had a prophetic vision. For proof of this I may refer not only to his rich fossil collection, including at his decease about 1050 specimens, but to his interesting posthumous paper in the 4 Phil. Trans.,’ 1794, on the fossil bones found in the caverns of the principality of Bayreuth. In this paper he compares these specimens with their recent analogues . . . alludes to the dif- ferent climates and localities of the globe to which animals are more or less confined, or their geographical distribution, which, con-

Why, I have not money enough to purchase gunpowder ! ” We must recollect the circumstances of that critical period in the history of Great Britain. Hunter died on October 16th, 1793, the very day of the judicial murder of Marie Antoinette. A few months earlier the violence and aggression of the French revolutionary leaders had driven them to de- clare war against Great Britain, and thus Pitt, sorely against his will, was forced into a war, the magni- tude and duration of which became more evident as the months rolled on, and which, in fact, never came to any final conclusion till the battle of Waterloo, more than twenty years afterwards.

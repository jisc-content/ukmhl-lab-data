INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 47 soon to have read Paley’s e Natural Theology ’ and would have been highly unlikely to read it had he lived ; but if he had read it he would have agreed heartily with its reasoning. Hunter’s philosophy is throughout entirely natural. He treats of every part of the system of nature, but about things supernatural he neither theorises nor even speaks. His works contain nothing to show whether the biographer is right or wrong who says that he had no feeling of religion. At any rate he wisely saw that the provinces of religion and natural philosophy are perfectly distinct, and that although the works of nature have furnished the wisest of men with cogent evidence of the existence of something higher, yet the operations of nature may be studied and described thoroughly without any theories of the supernatural.* The philosophers of the present day are much exercised about heredity. To judge from what some of them say about it one would think that the old commandment had been reversed—for now, instead of visiting the sins of the fathers on the children, we immediately proceed to lay all the faults and failings of the children on their parents * “ Hunter might with the same breath have consoled the veriest materialist and the most anxious theologian, and have told both that the field of nature is common ground, in which they may dig, and dig fearlessly, together, and that it will yield according to the seed with which it is sown.”—(Sir G. Humphry, * Hunterian Oration ’ p. 15.)

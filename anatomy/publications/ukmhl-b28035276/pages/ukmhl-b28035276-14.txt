INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. 8 by tliom to be the speaker, though when I think how unequal I am to the task I must, indeed, call for the indulgence of my colleagues and friends. Not only is the subject so immense that it can only be just touched on in the allotted time, but it has been treated at the College of Surgeons now fifty-seven times by the greatest surgeons and best orators of their day, from the first Hunterian Oration in 1814, by Sir E. Home, to Mr. Bryant’s in the present year,* so that anything like originality is impossible ; and yet I do not quite despair of holding your attention. In the lives and characters of these great men there is something of the endless variety and freshness of the nature whose interpreters they were. Their story, therefore, however poorly told, cannot alto- gether lack interest.! And to surgeons it can hardly be otherwise than useful to meditate for a while on the works of him who laid the foundation and erected so much of the edifice of scientific surgery. Would that that meditation might lead some of you to a deeper study of works so interesting, so profound, so suggestive! For my younger hearers especially— the students of Hunter’s school—what better em- ployment for the opening of their session than to contemplate the great example, how success and * The Hunterian Oration was founded by Sir E. Home and Dr. Baillie, and was at first annual, from 1814 to 1834 inclusive; it was omitted in 1835 and 1836, resumed in 1837, and continued annually till 1853, since which date it has been delivered every other year.— See ‘ Ottley’s Life,’ p. 146. f “ His fame is fixed too high for us ever to grow careless or weary of our theme.”—Holden, ‘ Hunterian Oration.’

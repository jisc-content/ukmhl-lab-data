THE LIVER away from the liver a fluid called the bile, which is prepared from The° first hvo convey their contents to the organ, and the last ^'"^Thrportal vein (Lat. vena price, or vein of the gate-the gate being the depression between the lobules of the hver) conveys fo the liver a large volume of blood which it collects from the veins of the sto?nach, intestines, pancreas, and spleen This blood has already circulated through the capillary systems of these organs, and is therefore of a dark purple colour, and at the same time is very rich in nutritious matter. The hepatic artery (Gr. hepar, the liver) brings to the liver a supply of bright arterial blood direct from the descending branch of Lhe aorta. The office of this blood is to nourish the structures of the liver. The blood of both these vessels, after it has circu- lated through the capillaries of the liver, is collected by the branches of the hepatic vein, which vessel con- veys it directly into the ascending or inferior vena cava (see fig. 128). The hepatic duct con- veys the bile into the gall- bladder or into the duo- denum—to the former if digestion is not going on, and to the latter if the di- gestive organs are active. The branches of the portal vein, the hepatic artery, and the hepatic duct all run together, side portal canals. ■ The substance of the liver is made up of small lobules, each about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, and therefore distinctly visible to the naked eye. Each lobule is formed of a peculiar Fig. 141. -The Portal Vein and its Branches.

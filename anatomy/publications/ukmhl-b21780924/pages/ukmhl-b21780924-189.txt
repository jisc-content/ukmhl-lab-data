THE BRAIN l8l the left, separated by a very deep fissure. It is composed of a thick layer of grey matter surrounding white fibrous nerve-sub- stance. The grey matter is drawn up into a number of folds or convolutions, by which its surface is greatly increased; and as the pia mater (which, it will be remembered, is the source from which the substance of the brain is supplied vith blood) dips into all the fissures between these folds, we tiave reason to believe that the use of this arrangement is to provide the brain with a plentiful Fig. 166.—Tlie Upper Surface of tlie Cerebrum, showing its division into two Hemispkeres, and also the Convolutions. supply of blood. The other coats of the brain—the a?-achnoid and the dura mater—do not dip into the fissures of the grey matter, but pass straight across them. The functions of the cerebrum.—The cerebrum is the chief seat of sensation, intelligence, the tvill, and the emotions. When we examine the brains of various animals, we notice that the size of the cerebral hemispheres and the complexity of the convolutions are proportional to the intelligence of the animal. Thus, in the

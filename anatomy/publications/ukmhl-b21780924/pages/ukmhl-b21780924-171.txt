163 THE SKIN The dermis, true skin {cutis vera), or corium consists of fibres of connective and elastic tissues, interwoven with minute blood- vessels and nerve fibres. Its surface is drawn up into finger-like projections called papillae, the largest of which are about of an inch in length. The outer portion is extremely well supplied with blood-vessels. Every papilla has its loop of capillaries. The deeper portion of the dermis is looser in texture, and contains an amount of fatty tissue. Beneath this again is a loose Fig. 151.—Vertical Section of the Skin and tlie Sub-cutaneous Tissue.

The use of this latter tissue is to fill up all the irregularities of surface in the underlying parts, and to give the rounded form and plumpness to the surface of the body. The fatty tissue also, being a bad conductor of heat, serves to keep the body warm by preventing the outward passage of heat. The sensibility of the skin as the organ of touch is due to the distribution of nerve fibres which terminate in the papillje of the M 2

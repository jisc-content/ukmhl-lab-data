170 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY These vessels of the kidney are (i) the renal artery (Lat. rencs^ the kidneys), which conveys bright arterial blood direct from the descending branch of the aorta ; (2) the renal vein, which collects the blood that has circulated in the capillaries of the kidney, and carries it direct to the ascending or inferior vena cava ; and (3) the ureter, v/hich carries away the fluid secreted from the blood, and conveys it to the bladder. We must now study a longitudinal section of the kidney. A clean cut should be made from the outer convex surface straight through to the hilus. It will be noticed that the ureter opens into a cavity with a number of short wide prolongations. The cavity is called the pelvis of the kidney, and its branches, calices (Lat. calyx, a cup). AVe also observe that the solid por- tion of the kidney consists of an inner medullary substance which has a fibrous appearance, and an outer cortical sub- stance of a darker colour. The medullary sub- Fie 157.-The Kidneys, Bladder, and their stance is not really fibrous, Vessels.

The apex or point of each pyramid is tfirned toward the pelvis of the kidney, into which it projects, presenting a number of minute openings which are the terminations of the little tubes of the pyramid. By squeezing the cut kidney, a little watery fluid may be made to drain from these litde tubes into the pelvis. From this cursory examination of the kidney it would appear that the blood from the renal artery is abundantly supplied to the cortical portion of the organ (hence the dark colour), where a

HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY LESSON L THE GENERAL BUILD OF THE LIUMAN BODY. The word physiology is derived from the two Greek wordsphnsis, nature ; and logos, a discourse. Literally speaking, therefore, the subject embraces all the various branches of natural science. But the term physiology is now generally applied only to the study of the functions of hving beings. Animal physiology deals with the functions of animals, but the term is now usually restricted to the study of man ; and accordingly the object of this work is to give a brief and simple outline of the life-processes of the human body. Of course it is impossible to understand the functions or uses of the various parts of the body without a knowledge of their struc- ture ; hence that branch of science which is called anatomy (Gr. ana, up, and tenmo, I cut) must go hand .in hand with physiology. The most obvious division of the human body is into head, trunk, and li/nbs or extremities. The head includes the face, and a bony box called the cranium which encloses the brain. The trunk encloses a large cavity which contains the parts that are engaged in the circulation of the blood, respiration, digestion, etc. The upper portion of the trunk is called the thorax or chest, and the lower portion the abdomen or belly.

223 THE VOICE thyroid and cricoid cartilages have already been described (see p. 140). The highest (posterior) portion of the cricoid is surmounted by two pyramidal cartilages called the arytenoid cartilag^es. These form movable joints with the cricoid, to which they are held by ligaments. They must also necessarily accompany the cricoid cartilage in all its movements. The arytenoid cartilages are connected with the interior surface of the front part of the thyroid cartilage by means of two bands of Fig. 214.—Back view of the Larynx. , thyroid ; 2, cricoid; 3, arytenoid cartilages; 4, upper ring of the trachea ; 5, ligaments; 6, epi- glottis.

These fibres form the so-called vocal cords. They are both at- tached to the thyroid cartilage close to the middle line, and con- sequently, when they are stretched, their edges are brought nearly parallel, so that only a thin slit is left for the air to pass between them. The epiglottis has nothing to do with the production of sound. It IS a cartilaginous lid, the lower and narrower portion of which is fastened by elastic bands to the front part of the thyroid carti-

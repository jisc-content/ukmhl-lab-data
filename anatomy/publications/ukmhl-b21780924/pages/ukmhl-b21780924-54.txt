ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 46 If we steep a piece of beef for a very long time in cold water, a large proportion of the blood oozes out and tinges the water, leaving the ilesh or muscle of o pale whitish colour. We notice also that it is composed of fibres. A large number of these mus- cular fibres, arranged side by side, and bound together by a skin or membrane, form a muscle ; and the various muscles of the body make up the muscular system. 'J"here are two kinds of muscles, voluntary and in- voluntary. The former, being under the control of the will, are those which give us the power of volun- tary motion and of loco- motion ; and these form the great bulk of the muscular system. The latter kind are to be found distributed in the substance of various in- ternal organs, and in the walls of blood-vessels; and are concerned in producing those movements over which the will has no control, such the beating of the heart. as and the motions of the sto- mach and intestines. Both voluntary and involuntary muscles are composed of fibres, but there is a distinct difference in the form of the fibres, as will be shown pre- sently. Most of the voluntary muscles are connected with bones at one or both ends, and every fibre composing them has the power, under the mfluence of the will, of contracting in length. One end of such a muscle is generally fas- tened by means of a tendon to a fixed bone, and the other end to the bone to be moved; so that when the muscular fibres contract, the whole muscle shortens, becoming consequently thicker in the middle, and causing one of the bones to be moved.

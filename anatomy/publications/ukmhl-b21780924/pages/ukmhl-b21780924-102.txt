94 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY and again, it often enlarges still more, till its outline consists of a number ot little pouches, all communicating with one common cavity. This last form of gland is generally known as the lobulated gland. Some glands develop to such an extent that they consist of a number of bodies resembling the simple glands just described, but all communicat- ing with one common duct. These are called compound glands. If they consist of a number of branching tubes they are called compound tubu- lar glands ; l)ut if composed of a group of sacs or lobules with one common outlet they are termed race- mose or compound lobulated glands. But although the glands vary so con- Compound Tubular Gland, siderably in form, yet they are all constructed on one general principle —all consist of a secreting membrane which is closely surrounded by a net- work of minute blood-vessels. The whole interior of the alimentary canal, from the mouth to the rectum, is Hned with a soft kind of skin called the mucous membrane. At the margins of the lips this membrane is con- tinuous with the skin which covers the exterior surface of the body. The mucous membrane is richly supplied with minute simple or compound glands called the mucous glands. These separate from the blood a watery fluid called mucus which serves to keep the membrane moist. In addition to the mucous glands the structures surrounding the cavity of the mouth are provided with numerous others called the salivary glands. These are all compound lobulated glands, Fig. 94.—Compound Lobulated Glands. A, a complete gland with its duct, ; b, a single lobule enlarged, with d, its duct. and secrete a fluid called the saliva which aids considerably in the process of digestion, as will be presently shown. The most important of the salivary glands are the three pairs known as the parotid, the submaxillary, and the sublingual. The parotid glands (Gr para, near : and ous, the ear) are

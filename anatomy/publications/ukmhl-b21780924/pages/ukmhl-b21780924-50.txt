ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 42 that the bone consists of two distinct kinds of substance. Its outer portion is composed of a very hard and compact substance, somewhat resembUng ivory. This is called the compact or dense tissue. It is thickest along the shaft, and is very thin around the heads. The heads of the bone are filled with a less compact mass, which is so porous and light that it is called the spongy or cancellous (Lat. cancelli, a grating) tissue. In addition to these two kinds of tissue, the central cavity of the bone contains a soft pulpy substance, called the marrow ; the cavity itself is called the medullary cavity. The marrow consists of fat cells and blood- vessels supported by a very delicate connecting membrane. The Fig. 47.â€”Transverse Section of the Compact Tissue of Bone. Magnified 150 diameters.

There is also a kind of marrow in the pores of the cancel- lous tissue, but it differs from that of the medullary cavity, m that it is reddish in colour, more fluid, and contains much less fat. The short and the irregular bones have no medullary cavity, but consist of a thin outer layer of compact tissue, filled in with cancellous tissue. The flat bones consist of a layer of cancellous tissue between two layers of the compact tissue. _ That part of a bone which assists in formmg a joint is covered with a smooth layer of articular cartilage.

The stomach. The intestines. The liver. The pancreas. The spleen. The kidneys. The bladder. The oesophagus passes through the diaphragm, and imme- diately widens out into the stomach. The stomach is a membranous and muscular bag, about ten inches in length from right to left, situated in part against the front wall of the abdomen, just beneath the diaphragm. It lies in part under the left portion of the liver. The stomach is somewhat pear-shaped, its larger end, called the cardiac extremity, being on the left, and the narrower end, called the pyloric ex- tremity, on the right. The oesophagus enters the stomach at about two or three inches from the cardiac end, the opening being called the cardiac orifice ; and the narrow end of the stomach communicates with the intestines by an opening which is called the pylorus (Gr. pulouros, a gate-keeper). The upper surface of the stomach is short and concave, while the lower is long and convex. The former is called the lesser curvature, and the latter the greater curvature. The right upper surface of the stomach is covered by the liver, which lies between it and the diaphragm. Food-substances enter the stomach by means of the cardiac orifice, and, after being thoroughly mixed with the digestive fluid of the stomach, pass through the pylorus into the intestmes. The intestines consist of two distinct portions, the small intestine, and the large intestine, both together occupying a large

17 THE SKELETON rartila-e next above it, so that they are united to each other before they reach the sternum. The eleventh and Iwelftli pairs are not connected at all with the breast-bone. The last five pairs are called false ribs ; and of these the eleventh and twelfth pairs are termed free or floating ribs. The collar-bone, which is attached to the sternum, and the shoulder-blade, which lies behind the upper ribs, will be best described with the bones of the arm. SUMMARY.

ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 162 skin' If we thrust a needle through the epidermis without pene- trating the dermis beneath, we feel no pain and shed no blood, but, as soon as the dermis or true skin is injured, we feel a sharp sensation of pain, and more or less blood flows. The internal cavities of the lx)dy are all lined with a soft, pinkish membrane called the mucous membrane; and this is continuous with the skin at the margins of the lips, the nostrils, the eyelids, &c, , ^ . The deeper portion of the epidermis, which connects the outer, horny layer with the true skin, is softer and less transparent. It is made up of minute cells, some of which contain granules of pigment or colouring matter. Healthy skin is always more or less pinkish in colour. This is not due to the pig- ment cells, but to the presence of blood capillaries in the der7nis, the colour of the blood being seen through the transparent epi- dermis. We sometimes describe the skin as 'dark' or 'fair,' 'tawny' or 'blonde'; and in these in- stances the differences in the tint are due to the amount of pigment in the cells of thepigmejit layer. In the European this amount is generally small; it is _^ ^.^^-^^^v^.-^^ crreatest in the skin of the negro. Fig. xsor-Vertical section through The pigiiaent ^ ^4*^^^^^^^^ fhe Skin of a Negro.

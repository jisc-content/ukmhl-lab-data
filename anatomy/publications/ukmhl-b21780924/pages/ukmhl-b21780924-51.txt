THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF BONE 43 surface is covered with a tough and fibrous membrane, called periosteum (Gr. peri, around, and osteo?i, a bone). Blood is supplied to the bone by small vessels from this periosteum, which pierce the bone underneath it. Other small vessels pierce the articular extremities, and pass to the cancellous tissue. The circulation of blood within the substance of the bone is brought about by means of a number of minute canals, which are to be found in all parts of the bone.

In order to study the minute structure of bone it will be necessary to cut a very thin slice from the compact tissue, and grind this down till it is semi- transparent. If the cutting be made transversely, it will show, under the microscope, cross sections of minute canals, called Haversian canals from Havers, who first discovered them. These canals vary in size, the average diameter being about ^ of an inch. The Haversian canals are surrounded by small, irregular spaces called lacunae (Lat. cavities), arranged in con- centric circles, and so giving the bone a laminated appear.ancc. Thp lacuna?

54 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY LESSON IX. THE LEVERS OF THE BODY. A lever is a rigid bar which is capable of turning freely about a fixed point called the fulcrum. In fig. 60, the bar WP is free to swing or turn on the fulcrum F. If we apply a downward pulling force at the point, P, that end of the lever will move downward ; Fig. 60.—Illustrating the Lever (First Order). \v, a weight suspended at one end ; f, the fulcrum ; p, the point at which the power is applied. but this pulling force may be resisted by suspending a weight at the other end of the lever. Thus we have two forces acting on the bar—one applied at the point P, and the other, the downward tendency of the weight suspended, acting at the point W. Levers are classified under three orders according to the relative positions of the fulcrum, the point at which a power is applied, and the point at which this power is counteracted by a Fig. 61.—A Crowbar, used as a Lever of the First Order. weight or any resisting body. The three orders are known as the first., second., and third. Levers of the first order are those in which the fulcrum is between the poiver and the iveight. The following are a few familiar examples :—

THE EAR 221 f Outer P4 Middle Internal Finna Canal Bones the endolymph, and thence to the otoliths, hair-hke processes, and the terminations of the auditory nerve. This nerve conveys the disturbance to the brain, giving rise to the sensation of hearing. Sound vibrations may also be transmitted to the auditory nerve through the bones of the skull, without penetrating the structures of the ear. It is probable that the cochlea enables us to determine \he pitch of a note, and also to distinguish between the qualities of different sounds ; while the semicircular canals aid us in distinguishing sounds according to their intensity or loudness, and also in determining the directions from which the sounds proceed.

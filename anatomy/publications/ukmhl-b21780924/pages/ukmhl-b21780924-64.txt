ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 56 applied at a point between the fulcrum and the weight. As an ex- ample we may mention— The treadle of a machine. We may now proceed to notice examples of levers which are to he found in the human skeleton. Levers of the first order :— (i) The head rocking on the atlas. The fulcrum is formed by those parts of the atlas that support the condyles of the occipital bone (see page 19). When the muscles of the back of the neck contract, the face is raised. When the antagonistic Pig. 66.—The Head rocking on the Atlas, illustrating the First Order of Levers. Fig. 67.—Tapping the Toe on the Ground. muscles in the front of the neck contract, the back of the head is raised. So that the face and the back of the head alternately represent the power and the weight. (2) Lift one foot, and then, by tapping the toe on the ground, we use the foot as a lever of the first order. In this case the power is applied behind by the contraction of the muscles of the calf, the fulcrum is at the ankle, and the ground offers the resist- ^^^Ja) The motion of the body on the hip is another illustration. The hip-ioints form the fulcrum ; and the contraction of the muscles connecting the pelvis with the bones of the leg provide Ihe powe° In this case the power (and the weight) may be alternately in front and behind.

HOW WE BREATHE Chest enlarged INSPIRATION EXPIRATION i SUMMARY. External intercostals contract. Raise the ribs. Make the chest wider. Diaphragm depressed. . Chest made deeper. Lungs expand with the chest. Air rushes in through the trachea, filling the larged lungs. Elastic walls of the thorax recoil Elastic lungs recoil. Internal intercostals con-- tract. Ribs depressed. Chest becomes nar- rower. Diaphragm raised. Chest made shallower. Abdotninal muscles con- tract. Abdominal organs press on under side of dia- phragm. \ Air forced out through the trachea. en- Chest made smaller Forced â€¢expira- tion. QUESTIONS ON LESSON XXVI. 1.

If you were shown a sheep's heart, how could you tell which was the right side and which was the left ? 12. How do the semilunar valves differ from the other valves on the same side of the heart ? LESSON XXIII. THE BLOOD-VESSELS AND CIRCULATION. The system of blood-vessels through which the blood circulates consists of arteries, capillaries, and veins. The arteries, as we have al- ready learnt, have strong, tough, and elastic zvalls, and convey the blood stream fro}?i the heart. These vessels have three dis- tinct coats :— 1. The outer strong and tough layer of areolar tissue, containing elastic fibres. 2. The middle muscular and elastic coat. This layer is so thick in the large arteries that it forms the greater part of the wall. The muscular fibres encircle the vessels. 3. The internal coat formed of layers of elastic tissue, lined with a delicate layer of epithelitim. The large arteries divide into branches as they proceed from the heart, and these branches again divide and subdivide into smaller and smaller arteries, till at last they give rise to the smallest vessels — the capillaries. The capillaries (Lat. capillus, a hair) are very minute vessels, having an average diameter of about ^Vo of an inch. They are pj„ 121. — Transverse Section through a small Artery and Vein.

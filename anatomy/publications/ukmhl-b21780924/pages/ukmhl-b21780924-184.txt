176 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY sympathetic system are chiefly suppUed to these organs and the blood-vessels, thus controllhig the involuntary movements, and regulating the supply of blood to the various parts of the body. Nerve substance or nerve tissue is eitlier cellular or fibrous. I'he cellular tissue is composed of branched cells together with interlacing fibres, and, on account of its colour, is called grey substance. It is found in the brain, the spinal cord, and iri all the other tierve centres. Fibrous nerve tissue is composed of fibres only, and is of two kinds—and white. The white fibrous tissue is an essential constituent of the cerebro-spinal nerves: it also enters largely into the structure of the brain and cord. The grey fibres are found principally in the nerves of the sympathetic system. Fig. 162.—Nerve-cells from the Grey Matter of the Brain. Each white nerve fibre is a minute semitransparent filament when fresh. But a few hours after death it undergoes changes and is then seen to consist of an outer membrane, in the middle of which is a coagulated central thread (the axis-cylinder), surrounded by a white sheath. The grey fibres closely resemble the white, but the white sheath enclosing the axis-cylinder is wanting. Each 7ierve is a bundle of such fibres, passing to or from a nerve centre, generally bound together by a delicate sheath of connective tissue called the neurilemma (Gr. neuroti, a nerve ; and le7nt?ia, rind). It may be easily distinguished in the body of an animal as" having the appearance of white or cream-coloured threads. We may pass on at once to notice the essential difference between nerves and nerve centimes. A nerve, composed of ner\'e fibres, has no power to generate what we may call a nerve impulse, but it can conduct an impulse already produced, along its fibres, either to or from the nerve centre with which it is connected. On the other hand, a nerve centre, which consists partly of the

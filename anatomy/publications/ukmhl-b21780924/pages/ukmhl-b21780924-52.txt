44 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY comnninicate with each other, and with the Haversian canals, by means oi very mimite canaliculi which radiate from them in all directions. If the section of bone be made longitudinally instead of transversely, then the Haversian canals will be opened along their length, as they run in the direction of the long axis of the bone. They will then be seen to branch and communicate with one another. The Haversian canals are well supplied with blood-vessels. The canali- culi and lacuna? take up the nutrient matter from the blood, and distribute it throughout the bone. SUMMARY. Bone. COMPOSITION . -{ Animal Matter STEUCTURE.

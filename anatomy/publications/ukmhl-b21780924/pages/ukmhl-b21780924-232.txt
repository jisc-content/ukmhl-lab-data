ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 224 lage. Its use is to close the upper opening of the larynx (the space between the vocal cords) during the act of swallowing, thus Fig. 216.—Posterior Muscles of the Larynx. I, posterior crico-arytenoid ; 2, arytenoid ; 3, 4, oblique fibres passing round the edge of the arytenoid cartilages to form 5, the muscles which connect these cartilages with the epiglottis. preventing particles of food or drink from passing into the trachea. During quiet breathing the vocal cords are relaxed, the glottis Is wide, and the air passes through freely. When we wish to speak or sing, we cause certain muscles to stretch the cords and bring them near each other. Under these conditions the out-rushing air sets them in vibration, thus B Fig. 217.—Three Views of the Larynx during Life, as seen by looking down the throat with the aid of the Laryngo- scope. A, during the sing- ing of a high note; B, during quiet breathing; C, while taking a very deep breath. base of the tongue; e, upper free part of the epiglottis ; e', lower por- tion of the epiglottis ; ^/i, front wall of the pharynx behind the laiynx ; a, tip of the arj'tenoid cartilage ; cv, vocal cords ; c7>s, superior or false vocal cords, which do not aid in the production of the voice; ir, front wall of the trachea; i, commence- ment of the two bronchi. producing sound. The contraction of muscles connecting the thyroid with the arytenoid cartilages (the thyro-arytenoid muscles) causes them to approach each other,

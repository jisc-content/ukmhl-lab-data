ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 58 Levers of the third order :— (i) Raising the forearm.—Here the elbow-joint forms the fulcrum, the forearm and hand the weight to be raised, and the power, which is supplied by the contraction of the biceps muscle, is applied at the radius. Fig- 71- —Raising the Forearm. (2) The extension of the leg after bending.—The knee-joint is the fulcrum, the lower leg and the foot the weight to be moved, Fig. 72.—Extension of the Leg. and the power is applied at the tibia in front of the leg, by means of muscles passing from it, over the knee-cap, to the hip.

To this end he may with advantage consider the motions of the lower jaw, the ribs, and other motions of the limbs.

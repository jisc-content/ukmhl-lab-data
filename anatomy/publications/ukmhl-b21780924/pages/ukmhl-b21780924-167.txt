1S9 THE LIVER bile is continuous, but is retarded during fasting, and in(||eased on talcing food. The quantity secreted daily is from thirty to forty ounces (about a pint and three-quarters). Sometimes some of this is reabsorbed into the blood, owing to an obstruction in the hepatic duct; and the result of this is a disease called Jaundice, charac- terised by the yellow colour of the skin.

The liver prepares another substance called glycogen, which resembles starch and sugar in composition. During digestion the portal vein conveys to the liver much more saccharine matter than is required for immediate use in the system, A portion only of this leaves the organ through the hepatic vein, while the excess is converted into granules of glycogen in thfe cells of the lobules. When digestion is over, and the liver is no longer receiving abundance of absorbed nourishment from the alimentary canal, the store of glycogen I'ecently laid by is gradually reconverted into sugar, and conveyed into the venous system through the hepatic vein. It thus appears that the liver performs the im- portant function of regulating the supply of sugar to the system by detaining a portion while it is being rapidly absorbed, and giving this off slowly during fasting. The sugar thus regularly supplied to the system is probably oxidised in the tissues, thus helping to maintain the high temperature of the body. The liver also seems to have the power of arresting various poisonous substances which have found their way into the blood. Thus, if any metallic poisons have been taken into the stomach, they reach the liver by the portal vein, and are there detained.

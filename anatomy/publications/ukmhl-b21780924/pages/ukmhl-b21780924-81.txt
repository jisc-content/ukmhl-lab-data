THE ORGANS OF THE ABDOMEN 73 four inches long and two and a-half broad, and weighing about four ounces each. They are situated at the back of the abdomen, one on each side of the vertebral column, deeply seated in the flesh of the ^oins on a level with the upper lumbar ^^rtebrse. These are the organs which we find imbfedded in the flesh'and fat of the ' loin of mutton.' The use of the " kidneys is to separate cer- tain poisonous substances Avhich have accumulated in the blood during its circu- lation throughout the body. These impurities are con- veyed away from the kidneys by two tubes called ureters, which communicate with, the bladder. The bladder is a very strong membranous and muscular bag which lies in'' the cavity of the pelvis. This organ serves to con-^ tain the fluid (the urine) which is being constantly excreted by the kidneys, thus enabling it to be dis- charged at intervals. Most of the organs of the abdomen are surrounded and supported by a mem- brane called the perito- neum (Gr. peri, about ; and teino, I stretch). This is a double membrane forming a shut sac, resembling the corresponding membranes (the pleurae and pericar- dium) of the thorax. Its outer layer lines the inner surface of the abdomen, and the other layer is reflected round the various organs, forming their exterior coverings. Some of the folds of the peritoneum connect portions of the intestines with the posterior walls of the abdomen. These are called the mesenteries (Gr. imsos, middle ; |and entcrojt, the intestine).

THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM 51 9. Describe the action of the muscles concerned during zualkuiir, nmnins and jumping. ^ 10.

THE STRUCTURE OF MUSCLE. There is a distinct difference between the structure of voluntary muscles and that of involuntary muscles. But the two kinds resemble each other in that— (1) They are both composed of fibres. (2) The fibres of both have the power of contraction. (3) -Both produce motion by this contraction We will first study the structure of voluntary muscles. As already stated, we include under this term all those muscles which may be set in motion by an effort of the will. If we remov^e the skin from the leg of a rabbit, we at once expose several of these voluntary muscles, each of which is connected with two separate bones. Then if we trace one of these muscles to one of Its ends —its origin or its inser- tion—we notice that it is con- nected with the bone by means of a tendon. Again, we may see that each of the muscles of the „ 55.—A small Portion of Muscle, consisting of larger and smaller Fasciculi. A, natural size ; b, magnified five diameters.

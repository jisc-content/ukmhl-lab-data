110 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY branc, while the undigested and indigestible portions pass onward towards the rectum. As soon as the chyme is subjected to the influence of the bile and pancreatic fluid, its appearance is changed, the emulsified fats giving it the appearance of milk. The term chyle is applied to the emulsified contents of the small intestine. After the chyle has passed through the whole length of the small intestine, it enters the large intestine through an opening which is guarded by two folds of the mucous membrane, 'i'hese folds project into the large tube, and so prevent the reflux of the contents into the small intestine. Thus they form a valve between the ileum and the cccciim, which is known as the ileo-caecal valve. Digestion continues in the large intestine ; the dissolved por- tions are gradually absorbed, leaving a residue which becomes more and more solid. The time occupied by the food in passing through the intes- tines varies considerably. Perhaps the average for the small intes- tine is twelve hours ; and, for the large, from twenty-four to thirty- six hours. Coats SMALL , INTESTINE \ Digestion.

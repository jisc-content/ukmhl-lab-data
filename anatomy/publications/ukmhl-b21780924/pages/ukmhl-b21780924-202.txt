ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 194 \vc arc made aware of certain conditions of various parts of the body. The following example will help to make this distinction clear:—The point of a needle is pressed against the skin. A sensation is at once experienced. This sensation is that of touch, and is at once referred to an external object. But if the needle is made to penetrate beneath the epidermis, a sensation of ])ain is produced, which continues after the needle has been withdrawn. The pain is no longer referred to an external object, but reveals to us a changed condition in a particular part of the body.

The sense of touch may be regarded as a modification of com- mon sensation; and all parts of the body which are supplied with sensory nerves are to a certain extent organs of touch; but this sense is perfected only in the skm, tongue, and lips. The sensibility of the skin is due to the presence of nerve fibres distributed through the dermis. Some of these nerve fila- ments subdivide in the skin, and possibly terminate in individual cells ; but many of them, especially in the more sensitive parts ot the skin, end in minute bodies of various forms.

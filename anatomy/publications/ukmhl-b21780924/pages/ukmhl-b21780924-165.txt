The spaces between the blood-vessels of the liver are filled with minute cells, about one-thousandth of an inch in diameter, called hepatic cells or liver cells. The blood capillaries run between these, and all changes which occur in the blood as it circulates through the liver are brought about by the action of the cells, which are separated from the blood only by the exceedingly thin walls of the capillaries. The materials which are separated from the blood in the blood ca- pillaries appear to pass through the liver cells to another set of capillaries which are called the bile capillaries. These unite Fig. 145.—Diagrammatic Representation of a Lobule in section. Tbe section takes the course of the intralobular vein. interlobular branches of the portal vein ; h, intra- lobular branches of the hepatic vein ; s, sublobular vein.

25 LESSON IV. THE SKELETON {continued^. The Bones of the Limbs. Each of the upper extremities consists of the shoulder, the upfie/ arm, the forearm, the wrist, and the hand. The bones of these Hmbs may be classified as follows : — } Togetherfo™i„g,he..WW/.. Humerus or bone of the upper arm. Radius ]- In Carpal or wrist-bones. Metacarpal bones, in the palm of the ha?id. Phalanges ox finger-hones. The clavicle (Lat. clavis, a key) is so called from its fancied resemblance to an ancient key. It is commonly known as the collar-bone. One end of it articulates with the top of the sternum, and the other extremity forms a joint with the scapula near its junction with the bone of the upper arm. The clavicle tends to keep the shoulders back. It is short and imperfectly formed in the rounded shoulders of the cat and the dog ; and in the horse and the sheep it is wanting. It forms, however, an essential part of the skeleton of the monkey, the squirrel, and other climbing animals. The scapula or shoulder-blade is triangular in form ; it con- sists of a broad flat portion, and a prominent ridge or spine at the back of this. The front surface is smooth and concave, and glides over the back convex surface of the chest. The outer end of the clavicle articulates with one of the two processes which project from the top of the scapula, and is attached to the other process by means of strong ligaments. At the upper and inner part of the scapula there is a shallow concave surface—the glenoid cavity (Gr. glen", the pupil ; ^wAeidos, form)—which receives the rounded head of the bone of the upper arm. It will thus be seen that the scapula is united to other bones only at or near the shoulder-joint. It has, therefore, great freedom of motion. The humerus or bone of the upper arm is very strong. It consists of a long portion called the shaft, and two enlaro-ed ex- tremities called the heads. As already mentioned, the upper head

ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY The internal intercostal muscles depress the ribs, thus making the chest narrower and assisting expiration. The student may construct for himself the simple apparatus illustrated in figs. 137, 138, and 139, which will at once make clear the action of the intercostal muscles. A B is an upright liar of wood which represents the spine. With this are jointed two parallel bars, C D and E V, which represent two of the rilis. Another bar, ]J F, represents the slcriuan. The joints at C, D, E, and F are all movable. An elastic band is now stretched obliquely between these parallel bars thus representing the intercostal muscles. If the band passes downwards and backwards {i.e. towards the spine) as in fig. 138, Fig. 136.—Intercostal Muscles. iv', v',and vi', 4th, 5th, and 6th dorsal vertebrae ; v, vi, and vii, 5th, 6th, and 7th ribs ; 5, 6, and 7, 5th, 6th, and 7th costal cartilages ; i, sternum; 2, external intercostal muscles; 3, internal intercostal muscles, the external layer having been removed. it represents the internal intercostals. As it contracts it tends to bring its two ends as near together as possible, and in doing this it pulls down the bars representing the ribs. By stretching the band downwards and foi-iuards, as in fig. 139, we illustrate the action of the external intercostals, which by their contraction raise the ribs. We are now better able to understand the respiratory move- ments, which may be briefly described as follows :— During inspiration the diaphragm descends, making the chest deeper ; and the external intercostals contract, thus raising the ribs and making the chest ivider. The capacity of the chest being thus enlarged, the lungs are inflated as before described.

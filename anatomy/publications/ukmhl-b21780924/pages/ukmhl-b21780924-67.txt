What is a lever ? Illustrate your answer by an example. Give common examples of the three orders of levers. Give an example of each of the three orders of levers as exemplified in the human body. Show how the three orders of levers may be illustrated by the foot. LESSON X. THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN. The student will remember that the body of a vertebrate animal contains two distinct tubes or cavities. One of these is sur- rounded by bony walls, and includes the cavity of the skull and the spinal canal, which communicates with it. The other is the great cavity which contains the organs of digestion, circulation, &c. We will now proceed to notice the form of the great body cavity ; and here we strongly recommend the dissection of a small animal. In this in- stance an animal no larger than a rat will answer the purpose. Lay the dead animal on its back, stretch out its limbs, and pin them firmly to a flat board. Now take a sharp-pointed knife, and cut the skin from the throat in a straight line down to the tail, taking care that the knife does not e iter htto the Hesh at anypoi7U._ Now loosen the skin from the flesh, and pin it also to the board, spreading It out, right and left, to the greatest possible extent. The arrrange- ment of the ribs may now be seen, with the thin walls of muscle or flesh

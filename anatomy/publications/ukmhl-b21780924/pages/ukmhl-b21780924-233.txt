THE VOICE 22^ and so relaxes the vocal cords. When the crico-thyroid muscles contract, they cause the cricoid cartilage to rotate in such a manner as to tilt the arytenoid cartilages backward, and so to put the cords on the stretch. Other muscles are so arranged that they pull asunder the edges of the arytenoid cartilages to which the cords are attached and thus open the glottis; while others, acting in the opposite direction, tend to bring the cords close to and parallel with each other. The pitch of a note depends on the number of vibrations per second : the more rapid the rate of vibration, the higher the pitch. For example, 128 vibrations per second will produce the bass C ; 256, the tenor C ; 512, the treble C; and 1,024, the octave above ; and so on. If we stretch a wire or string, we can make it vibrate by pluck- ing it; and by either shortening the string or by increasing the stretching force, we in- crease the rate of vibration, and so heighten the pitch of the note produced. The rate of vibration also depends on the thickness of the string ; the thicker the string, the less the rate of vibration. The more the vocal cords are stretched, the higher the pitch of the note given out. We may imitate the production of sound by the larynx as follows :—Take a glass tube, about | of an inch in diameter, and grind one end down to an angle of 45° on two opposite sides (see fig. 218). Now stretch over these ground edges two thin strips of elastic band, leaving only a narrow space between, and secure by tying round with thread. By blowing a current of air between these stretched bands they are made to vibrate, thus producing a sound ; and by altering the length of the tube, and changing the stretching force of the elastic bands, we can vary the pitch of the note. The quality of the note depends on various conditions, among which may be mentioned the shape of the mouth, the position of the tongue, the communica- Fig. 218.—Illustrating the manner of pro- ducing a Musical Sound by sending a current of air between two stretched Elastic Bands. tion or non-communication between the pharynx and the nasal cavities, the position of the larynx, &c. th/firr^i^!'''""' the larynx of the male is constructed exactly like that of nrr2r= • ' • T ''^•''^'"S ^ ^^''^^'^ ^^^y"-^ of *e male rapidly increases m size becommg more prominent in the front of the throat.

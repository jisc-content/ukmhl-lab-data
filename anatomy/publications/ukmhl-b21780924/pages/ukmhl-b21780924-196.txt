The nerve trunks are thus formed by the union of anterior and pos- terior roots ; and after division and subdivision they supply fibres to the skin and the voluntary muscles. Each of the posterior roots has a ganglion, the use of which is unknown. The functions of the roots of the spinal nerves have been ascertained by llic following observations:—i. If the anterior r Yig. 173.—Hoots of a Spinal Nerve issuing from the Cord. A, from before ; B, from the side; C, from above; D, tbe roots separated.

In A one anterior root is divided and turned upwards. roots of the spinal nerves supplying a certain limb are injured, the power of voluntary movement in that limb will be more or less destroyed, and the limb will hang in a flaccid condition, but sensation will remain unimpaired. If one of the roots is divided, any irritation applied to that portion which remains m contact with the cord will cause no sensation, nor will there be any movement of the limb in question. But if the other portion of the divided root be irritated, the muscles of the limb will contract.

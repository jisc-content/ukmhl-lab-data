■103 THE CESOPHAGUS AND STOMACH in a dissolved form by thoroughly washing the mucous membrane of the stomach of any animal with water ; or it may be procured an the solid form from the chemist. The power of pepsm as .a digestive fluid may be illustrated by the followmg experi- ment :— Cut up a little lean meat into very small pieces, thus imitating mastication. Put ihem into a vessel with some water, a little pepsin, and a drop or two of hydrochloric acid. Heat this mixture up to a temperature of 100° F. (the temperature of the body), and keep it at this for a few hours, stirring fre- quently with a glass rod to imitate the motions in the stomach. The meat thus treated will be reduced to a pulp as in the stomach. The gastric fluid has no action on starchy foods, neither does it act on fats. The former, however, are dissolved in the stomach by the swallowed saliva, but the acidity of the gastric juice somewhat retards this action. Fatty tissue .consists of fat cells united together by areo- lar tissue, and each cell consists of a particle of fat surrounded by a cell-wall of albuminous (nitrogenous) substance. Con- sequently, when fatty tissue passes into the stomach, the areolar tissue and the albumi- nous cell-walls are dissolved, and the fat itself is set free in the form of minute globules, giving the whole contents of the sto- mach a milky appearance. This milky fluid is called chyme (Gr. cheo, I pour) because it \s> poured into the intestine. It consists of— {ci) Saliva and partially dissolved starchy foods. lb) Gastric fluid and partially dissolved nitrogenous foods, (c) Undigested fat in the form of minute globules. . \d) Mucus from the mucous glands. (e) Indigestible substances. The character of the chyme varies considerably according to Fig. loi.—Peptic Gland from the Mucous Memhrane of the Sto- mach.. Highly magnified.

THE BLOOD-VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 139 Auricular Contraction ACTION OF THE HEART Ventricular Contraction \ CIRCULA- TION Beating Sounds In arteries In capillaries In veins Simultaneous. Blood forced into ventricles. Force not sufficient to cause regurgitation into the veins. Valves between the auricles and ventricles closed. Chorda tendinea tightly stretched. Semihmars forced open. Blood forced into the great arteries. Apex of heart tilted forward against the front wall of the chest. From 60 (old age) to 120 (young child) per minute. Dtill sound—closure, of Iricuspid ^nA mitral valves, and contraction of ventricles (?). Sharp sotind—?,ViM&n closure of semilunars. Followed by a pause. In jerks [pulsations). Very rapid. Elastic recoil tends to produce a continuous stream in the smaller arteries. Very slow and uniform. Great resistance offered by the capillary walls. Much faster than in capillaries. Not so rapid as in arteries. Steady flow. Valves prevent backward flow.

Where are they found? WTiat is the size of a capillary ? 3. What is the use of valves in veins ? How are these valves constructed ? 4. Name arteries that have valves, and veins that have no valves. 5. Plow would you determine the positions of the valves in the veins of your own arm? 6. Describe fully the action of the heart and its valves.

Ii8 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY found abundantly in stagnant water, called the amaba. 'J'hey also, like the amoeba, are constantly shooting out irregular processes, and are therefore said to be capable of amoiboid movements. The colourless corpuscles are not nearly so numerous as the red, the proportion being about one to five hundred. The proportion, however, varies considerably, being dependent on the kind and amount of food taken, age, &c. When freshly-drawn blood is allowed to remain at rest for a few minutes it becomes semi-solid and jelly-like by the formation of what is called a clot. At first the clot thus formed constitutes the whole mass of the blood, and is of the same uniform colour. But after a short time a very pale yellowish, liquid begins to ooze out and collect on the surface. The clot becomes gradually smaller as this liquid exudes, till, at the end of a few hours, it "is much firmer, and floats in the yellowish fluid. The clot is due to the formation of fibrin—a sub- stance which is not present in living blood, but is formed spontaneously, after the blo6d has been drawn, from mate- rials in solution. This change in the blood is termed coagu- lation ; and the liquid which separates from the clot is called serum {zvhey). The serum is almost entirely free from corpuscles, these being entangled with the fibrin. The following tables will assist in making this change clear Fig. .

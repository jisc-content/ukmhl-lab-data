WASTE AND REPAIR—FOODS 8$ nitrpgen. This not only implies a waste of food substance, but also that a great deal of extra work is thrown on certain organs. Next, let us suppose that he feeds on lean meat only. Then, in order to obtain the necessary quantity of carbon, he must eat no less than 6^ lbs. daily, as this weight of lean meat contains Carbon 4,500 grs. Nitrogen . . . . 1,35° gi's- In this case we notice a similar waste of nitrogen, the removal of which would also give an undue amount of work to the organs concerned. But it is possible to take such a mixed diet of bread and meat as will supply all the requirements of the system, and at the same time yield but little waste material. In doing this we also reduce the total amount of food taken. Thus : 2 lbs. of bread contain . . carbon 4,500 grs., and nitrogen 150 grs. f lb. of lean meat contains . carbon 500 grs., and nitrogen 150 grs. Total .... 5,000 grs. 300 grs. So that by eating no more than 2| lbs. of solid food daily we should be enabled to repair all the waste of the body, taking an excess of 500 grains of carbon only. This clearly shows the ad- vantage that may be gained by a mixed diet which is selected with due regard to the requirements of the body. A model food is one which contains nitrogenous, non-nitro- genous, and mineral food substances in the proportions in which they are required to make good the waste of the body. Among such foods may be mentioned (i) milk, on which young animals entirely subsist ; and (2) eggs, which provide all the nourishment to young birds till they are hatcned.

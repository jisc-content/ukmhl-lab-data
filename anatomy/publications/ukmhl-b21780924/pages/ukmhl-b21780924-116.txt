io8 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY respectively. The former is i)repared by the liver, and the latter by the pancreas. Both these Uuids enter the duodenum at or near the same point, one being conveyed from the liver by means of the bile-duct and the other from the pancreas by the pancreatic duct. The pancreas is a lobulated gland, situated within the curve of the duodenum, as already described in Lesson XIII. In structure it closely resembles the salivary glands. The liver will be fully described in Lesson XXVII. Fig. 104.—The Stomach, Duodenum, Liver, Spleen, and Pancreas. I, stomach ; 2, pylorus ; 3, duodenum ; 4, liver (under surface); 5, gall-bladder ; 6. pan- creas ; 7, bile duct; 8, pancreatic duct; 9, spleen; 10, aorta; 11, portal vein; 12, splenic ariery ; 13, splenic vein. The pancreatic juice is a colourless and transparent fluid ; which is slightly alkaline and viscid, and of which twelve to sixteen ounces are secreted daily. It contains— Water „ , ( Pancreatin I Inorganic salts, &c. . 1000'O ts The function of this fluid resembles that of the saliva, but is more varied in its action. Thus, it converts starchy foods into soluble grape-sugar; but like the gastric fluid it dissolves albumin- ous and gelatinous foods, converting them into peptones ; it also emulsifies fats, rendering them U for absorption.

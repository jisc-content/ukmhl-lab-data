9 GENERAL BUILD OF THE HUMAN BODY There are other organs, called the excretory organs, which perform the office of removing certain impurities from the blood as it circulates through them. The chief of these organs are the liver, the kidnevs, and the skin ; to which may also be added the lungs: for, in ^addition to being aerated, the blood, while in the lungs, is caused to give up a gas called carbonic-acid gas, which it has collected in its passage through the various parts of the body. The liver is a very large reddish-brown organ, which prepares a substance called bile from the blood. Although the separa- tion of bile may be re garded as a process of blood - purification, yet the bile itself is utilised in the digestion of food. The liver, therefore, is not simply an excre- tory organ, but may also be said to belong to the digestive system. The kidneys, two in number, are im- portant blood-purifiers. They separate a poison- ous substance called urea from the blood. The skin, which en- tirely covers the exterior surface of the body, is more than a mere pro- tective covering, for its deeper layer contains numerous small bodies, in which a process of blood - purification is carried on, the impu- rities separated being conducted by minute tubes to the pores or openings which may be seen with a lens on the surface of the skin. The nervous system consists of two parts. One of these is called the cerebrospinal system, and the other the sympathetic or ganglionic system. The cerebro-spinal system consists of the brain and the spinal cord, together with the numerous nerves which proceed from these organs to almost all parts of the body. The sympathetic system (see fig. i6i) consists of a large number of small masses of nerve substance (ganglia), and the nerves connect- Fig. 7.â€”Front View of the Larynx, Trachea, and Lungs.

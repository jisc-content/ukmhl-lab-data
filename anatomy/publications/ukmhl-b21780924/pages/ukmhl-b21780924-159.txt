HOW WE BREATHE 10 c •> In tranquil breathing the inspiration of air is effected chiefly by the diaphragm in men, while in forced inspiration the inter- costals play a very important part. In women the diaphragm does not play so important a part as the ribs. As the ribs are raised during inspi- ration, the sternum will of course rise with them. This movement may be noticed by laying the hand on the front of the chest while taking a deep inspiration. Again, when the dia- phragm moves, the organs of the abdo- men must follow its movements, and this causes a visible motion of the walls of the abdomen. Hence respi- ration which is effected chiefly by the diaphragm is often termed abdo- minal respiration, while that pro- duced chiefly by movements of the side walls of the chest is called costal respiration. After the lungs have been inflated by the inspired air they are stretched considerably, and their elasticity is sufficient in Fig. 137.

SENSATIONS—TOUCH The largest of these are oval bodies having a diameter of from to — of an inch. Tliey are called Pacinian bodies, after Pacini, their discoverer, and are abundantly distributed in the skin of the hands and feci. Other smaller bodies, called touch corpuscles or tactile corpuscles, are abundant in highly sensitive parts of the skin. In the most sensitive parts of the skin papillae are very abun- dant, and the epidermis lying over them is thin. Many of the papillce are also supplied with touch corpuscles. In other parts, as in the heel, the outer skin is so thick that the sense of touch is dulled. The degree of sensitiveness of the skin may be measured by the power of distinguishing between two or more sensations pro- Fig. 178.—Papillse of the Skin from the Palm of the Hand.

Apply the.se points to the palm of the hand, and two distinct sensations are produced. Now apply the points to the skin of the arm, and the sensation is such as would be produced by the application of a single point. Hence we say that the hand is more sensitive to touch than the arm.

'.I _ As a further illustration of the varying sensitiveness of the skin, move the compass points over the skin, from the cheek to the hps, and the distance between the points appears to be gradually increasing. This power of distinguishing between sensations is not due to the thinness of the epidermis, but to the abundant distribution of the nerve filaments. o ?

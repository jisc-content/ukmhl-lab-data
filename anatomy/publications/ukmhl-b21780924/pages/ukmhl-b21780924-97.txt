THE TEETH AND MASTICATION 89 but is penetrated by a multitude of very delicate tubes which communicate with the cavity of the tooth. This cavity is called the pulp-cavity. It contains a very soft substance—the pulp. This consists of a mass of minute blood- vessels and nerves which enter through an opening at the point of each fang. The dentine which forms the crown of the tooth is covered with a substance called the enamel. It is the hardest substance in the body, and contains only two or three per cent, of animal Fig. 87.—longitudinal Section of a Molar Tooth. k, crown ; n, neck \ f, fangs ; e, enamel; d, dentine ; c, cement; p, pulp cavity. matter. When examined under a high magnifying power, the enamel is seen to consist of exceedingly fine hexagonal fibres. The root of each tooth is surrounded by a substance called the cement. This substance is softer than the dentine, and in structure resembles bone—it contains la&utm and canaliculi, but no Haversian canals. The use of the teeth is to masticate the food, that is, to reduce it to such a finely divided state that it may be readily acted on by the various digestive fluids. It has already been noticed that the different kinds of teeth are adapted for different modes of action;

123 THE HEART AND ITS DISSECTION The student, having provided himself with a sharp knife with a pointed blade, a few wood skewers, and a jug of water, may now proceed with the examination and dissection of the heart as follows :— Place the point of the knife just underneath the surface of the heart, so as to raise a portion of the very thin membrane or skin which closely invests it. This membrane is the inner layer of the pericardium, the outer layer of which, it will be remembered, surrounds the heart loosely, and is cut or torn away in removing the organ from the chest. A few remaining portions of this outer Fig. 114.—The Sheep's Heart, viewed from before. I, right ventricle ; 2, left ventricle ; 3, right auricle; 4, left auricle; 5, the aorta; 6, a cut branch of the .lorta ; 7, pulmonary artery. To open the right ventricle, cut as shown by the thick unbroken line. To open the left ventricle, cut along the thick dotted line. Between these two -n-. mv« tt.,~ tt.„„(. _„j i*- lines is a groove containing a blood- Fig. 115. —The Human Heart and Its vess -1, marking the position of the Vessels, viewed from before, septum which separates the ventri- ^-^-^^^ ventricle; 2, left ventricle; 3, root of the pulmonary artery cut short; 4, 4', and 4", the aorta; 5, right auricle ; 6, left auri- cle ; 7, veins which unite to form the vena cava superior; 8, inferior vena cava ; 9, he- patic vein; +, coronary arteries. layer may still be seen attached to the great blood-vessels at the base of the heart, for it is here that the inner adherent layer is reflected back to form the outer and loose layer. Now notice the two thin fleshy flaps which lie over the base of the heart like ears, one on each side. These are the auricles (Lat. anrimla, a little ear). They are hollow, and, of course, when distended with blood, do not lie so flat. Notice also the general conical shape of the heart.

THE KIDNEYS i Much water. 2. The skin ] Little carbonic acid gas. i Little urea. Much water. 3. The kidneys] Much urea. I Little uric acid. The blood which leaves the kidneys by the renal veins is often said to be the purest blood in the body. It has lost much nitrogenous waste matter. Of course a certain proportion of the blood which enters the kidneys goes to nourish the walls of the vessels of which the organs are almost entirely composed. Hence this blood would tend to become venous by its loss of oxygen and its gain of carbonic acid gas. But this is counterbalanced by the excretion of the urine, which contains relatively more carbonic acid gas and less oxygen than the blood from which it was formed. As a result of this, the blood of the renal vein, which has lost so much nitrogenous matter, is still arterial in character. ^ Weight Position Covering Vessels KIDNEY . Eenal artery Beual vein.

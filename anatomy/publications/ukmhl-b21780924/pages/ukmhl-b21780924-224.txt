LESSON XXXVI. THE EAR. The ear consists of three parts :â€”the external ear, the middle ear or tympanuin, and the internal ear or labyrinth. The last of these divisions is the essential part of the organ of hearing, the other two being concerned merely in the collection and transmission of sound vibrations. The outer ear consists of the pimia (Lat. a wing), that part which projects from the side of the head, and the auditory ca7tal. The pinna, being concave, is especially adapted for the collection of sound waves which are reflected by it into the canal. It consists of a cartilaginous framework, surrounded by a certain amount of fatty tissue and a few small muscles, the whole being covered with integument. The pinna is thrown into several elevations and depressions, the names of which may be learnt from the accompanying illustration.

The oesophagus is the narrowest portion of the ahmentary canal, and, although generally described as muscular, it consists of three distinct coats.^â€”The outer coat is thick and muscular, and con- sists of two distinct sets of muscular fibres, some running longi- tudinally, i.e. lengthwise down the tube, and the others passing in a circular direction round it. The inner coat is a mucous mevi- bmne, which, as its name implies, contains mucous glands ; it is drawn up into longitudinal folds, thus increasing the amount of secreting surface. The middle coat consists of a loose filamentous membrane called connective, areolar, or fibrous tissue, which imites the outer and inner coats of the tube. After the food has been masticated and thoroughly mixed with the saliva, it is collected into a bolus by the tongue and the muscles of the cheeks, and then passed between the tongue and the palate till it reaches, the back of the mouth. This muscular action may be voluntary, but is usually performed uncon- sciously. The food must now pass into the pharynx without touching the posterior nares or entering the glottis. This is accomplished as follows The larytix and pharynx are both raised together and carried forward under the tongue. The glottis is closed by the epiglottis ; and the posterior narcs are shut off by the sides of the soft palate. The contraction of the muscles at the back of the mouth forces the food over the epiglottis into the pharynx. The pharynx now contracts above it, and the bolus is forced into the

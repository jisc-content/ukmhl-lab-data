ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY the circumvallate papillae (T.at. circuin, around ; and valhm, a rami)art) because they arc each surrounded l)y a kind of wall or rampart. All the papilla are richly supplied with blood-vessels and nerves. The nerve fibres are obtained from two sources—the glossopharyngeal and the ffik pairs of cranial nerves. The former nerves supply the back of the tongue and of the palate, while the latter send their fibres to the middle and tip of the tongue. It is probable that both these nerves are nerves of taste, although they appear to be dissimilar in their functions. It is easy to prove, for instance, that different portions of the mucous membrane of the tongue and palate possess different powers. Sweet and salt tastes are perceived more readily at the tip than at the back of the tongue. Sugar may be brought into contact with the back of the tongue or palate without any taste being detected, at least until the tongue and the palate have been pressed together. Bitter tastes are perceived best when applied to the lack part of the tongue, and acids at the edge.

It appears that, in order to produce the sensation we call taste the particles of the substance tasted must come m actual contact with the nerve-terminations of the mucous membrane ; that is, they must penetrate the outer layer of the membrane which covers he nerve-endings. Hence the substance to be tasted must either e in solution, or must be capable of being dissolved in the saliva or the mucus of the mouth, so that it may be easily absorbed We must also remember that there is no sensation without he brain-that we do not taste a substance till the irritation of the sensory fibres has been transmitted through these fibres to the brain.

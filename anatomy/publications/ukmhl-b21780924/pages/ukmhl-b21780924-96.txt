KLEMF.NTARY PHYSIOLOGY 88 the age of about seven years these milk teeth begin to be cast off, their places being taken by the permanent teeth which grow be- neath them ; and, at about the age of twelve, all have in this way given place to the permanent set. The permanent teeth of the adult number thirty-two. They consist, in each jaw, of four incisors, two canines, four bicuspid, and 3 4 Fig. 86.—Section of the Jaws of a Child of Z\ Years, showing the Milk or Deciduous Teeth, Fig. 85. — Showing the also the Permanent Teeth in Process of four kinds of Human Formation.

The last of the molars are called the wisdom teeth; they do not appear till between the seventeenth and twenty-fifth years. The mass of a tooth consists chiefly of a hard substance called dentine or ivory (Lat. de7is, a tooth). It resembles in composition the compact tissue of bone, but contains a much larger proportion of mineral matter (seventy-two per cent.), and is consequently harder. The mineral matter, like that in bone, consists chiefly of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate ; and the animal matter may also be made to yield gelatine by boiling. In structure dentine differs from bone, as it contains no Haversian canals, lacunas, &c..

ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 158 to ft)rm smnll biliary ducts, which by their further union form the two larger ducts. One of these conveys the bile from the left lobe, and the other from the right, while both unite to form the hepatic duct. The gall-bladder is connected with this tube by a duct of its own, called the cystic duct (Gr. kustis, a bladder), and these two unite into the common duct, which leads direct to the duodenum. The gall-bladder is a pear-shaped bag, situated on the under surface of the liver. It is supported by the peritoneum, which passes below it; and its broader end projects be- yond the front margin of the liver. The cystic duct is connected with the narrow end. The most important function of the liver is the secretion of the bile. And this single function serves a twofold purpose : for, not only is the bile turned to account as a powerful digestive fluid, but its separation from the blood is a means of the removal of an excess of carbon and hydrogen which has accumulated in that fluid; these ele- , ,. „ , ments being found largely —Stomacil, Liver.

THE SKELETON 3I The femur or thigh-bone corresponds with the humerus of the 'irm In general form it resembles that bone, but is much larger ^ and stronger, having to bear the weight of the body. Its upper extremity is provided with a rounded head which articulates with the acetabulum of the hip-bone, forming a ball-and-socket joint, somewhat similar to that of the upper arm, but differing in one important respect. The rounded head of the femur is much more prominent than that of the humerus, and the acetabulum is much deeper than the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Thus the thigh has not the freedom of motion of the humerus, but is less easily dislocated. The calf-bones, like those of the fore.- arm, are two in number—the tibia or shin-bone, and the fibula (Lat. a clasp or buckle) or splint-bone. These bones cor- respond with the ulna and the radius, but the fibula does not rotate round the Fig. 34.—Right foot, viewed from above. a, b, cd, c, /, g; and h, the tarsal Dones ; I to V, meta- tarsal bones ; i and 3, pha- langes of great toe ; i, 2, and 3, phalanges of second toe.

TONGUE AND TASTE—NOSE AND SMELL 199 stance frequently suggests the taste, and the taste sonietinies suggests the odour. When the sense of smell is temporarily destroyed during a severe cold, taste is often partially or entirely lost until the sense of smell returns. This explains also the common practice of holding the nose while taking a dose of nauseous physic. The organ of smell is the mucous membrane which lines the surfaces of the ethmoid bone, this portion only of the nasal cavities being supplied by filaments of the olfactory nerves. Fig. 182.—Nerves of the Outer Wall of the Left Nasal Cavity. During ordinary breathing through the nose, the air passes gently through the lower and wider portions of the nasal cavities, without disturbing to any great extent the air which is enclosed by the scroll-like folds of the turbinated bones. Consequently, even though the air may contain particles of odorous matter, few or none of them come into contact with the terminations of the olfactory nerve, and little or no sensation of smell is experienced. When we wish to perceive an odour more distinctly, we 'sniff' the air. In doing this we dose the mouth so as to direct the whole of the mspired air through the nose ; and then draw in the air by repeated short and sudden inspirations. This causes up- ward and abrupt rushes into the nasal cavities, the effect of which IS to disturb the comparatively still air of the olfactory part of the nose, and to exchange some of it for the air containing the odorous substance. As soon as the particles of this substance touch the

LIGAMENTS. CARTILAGE. JOINTS !5 skeleton of a very young animal consists entirely of cartilage, and as the animal develops into maturity, the bones become gradu- ally harder by the slow absorption of mineral matter derived from its food substances, till at last the skeleton consists almost entirely of bone. Cartilage is not supplied with blood, hence it is white or semi- transparent. When boiled for some time with water, it yields a substance called ehon- drine (Gr. choiidros, cartilage), which closely resembles gelatine, be- ing soluble in hot water and forming a ' jelly' on cooling. Those cartilages which are converted into bone during growth are called temporary cartilag-es; whilst those which remain un- changed are termed permanent cartilages. The uses of carti- lage are various. It is tough, fiexible, and elastic; and will be found in all parts of the body where these properties are essenrial. Sometimes it helps to form a flexible frame- work, as in the costal cartilages of the walls of the chest.

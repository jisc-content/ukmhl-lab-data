197 LESSON XXXIV. THE TONGUE AND TASTE. —THE NOSE AND SMELL. The tongue is a muscular organ covered with mucous membrane. It is attached by means of muscles to the lower jaw, and is also connected behind with the hyoid bone. The organ of taste is the mucous membrane of the tongue, especially that at the upper and back surface, and also the mucous membrane of the posterior portion of the palate. On the under surface of the tongue the mucous mem- brane is smooth and thin, like that of the walls of the mouth generally ; but its upper surface is rendered rough and sensitive to taste by a number of papillae which are richly supplied with nerve terminations. The papillae of the tongue are large compared with those of the dermis ; they are also quite distinct from each other. The smallest and most nu- merous of these are conical or cylindrical in shape, and are called filiform (Lat./Z/w/, a thread). Mixed with these are a number of larger papillce called fungiform fungus, a mushroom) on account of their resemblance in form to certain of the fungi. They each consist of a round and broad extremity supported on a narrower stalk, and are Fig. 179-—The Upper Surface of the Human Tongue, At L v^'^f'^;^ ^'^^^ their deep red colour. b i mnnS 'r-^"" '^^'^ ^^^^^ to twelve very etferT-^^.h t^'^'^- '^'^ 'i^T ^^^^^"^^y' ^« ^o form the letter V with the pomt turned backwards.

LIGAMENTS. CARTILAGE. JOINTS 37 which glide over each other. In such cases the cartilaginous surfaces are smooth, thus making the motion easier. The cartilage which serves this purpose is called articular cartilage. Joints are distinguished as immovable and movable. Immovable joints are those in which the bones are in actual contact, i.e. without any intervening cartilage ; and are incapable of motion on each other. In some such joints, as in the skull, Fig. 41.—The Joints of the Pelvis. I, ligament of t_he_vertebrae ; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, other ligaments ; 9 and 10, ball and socket joint of the hip in part dissected, to show the synovial cavity ; and also the ligament {liga- 77tenUim teres) which connects the ball of the femur with the interior of the acetabulum. each bone has a very irregular sawlike edge, and the teeth or pro- jections of the opposite edges are firmly dovetailed together. Immovable joints are often called sutures (Lat. sutura, a seam). Movable joints are those in which the bones forming them are capable of motion against each other. These joints are sub- divided into pei-fed or complete^ and imperfect or incomplete. The perfect joints are of four kinds, viz :—(i) gliding-joints, consisting of bones which slide over each other, as those of the ankle and wrist; (2) ball and socket joints, consisting of a rounded head which rotates in a hollow socket, as the hip-joint and shoulder-joint; (3) hinge joints, like those of the elbow and the

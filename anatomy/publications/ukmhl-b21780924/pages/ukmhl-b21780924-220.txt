ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 212 photographer's camera. If we look at an object at a certain distance, we see that object distinctly because its image is distinct on the retina ; but other objects in the same direction which are either nearer or more remote are more or less indistinct. If we now direct the attention to another object nearer than the first, the image of this object becomes sharp on the retina. And, since the retina has not moved, the refractive power of the eye must have increased in order to 'focus' this nearer object. This change has been brought about by the ciliary muscles acting in- directly on the crystalline lens (see p. 208). When we turn from near to distant objects, the opposite change takes place. The ciliary muscle relaxes, the suspensory ligament is pulled towards the edge of the choroid, and the lens becomes less convex. Thus Fig. 201.â€”The Photographer's Camera. A, a brass tube containing the lens'and the diaphragm ; b, the screen on which the image falls. the adjustment of the eye depends on the ciliary muscle and its consequent action on the crystalline lens. In some persons the cornea is more convex than usual, and in others the refractive power of the crystalline lens is above the average. In these cases the retina is too far back for the image to be sharply defined, and consequently the vision is ir. dTstfnct. Such persons are said to be short-sighted; and they may remedy their defective vision by wearing concave glasses, which cause rays of light to diverge. , As old age advances the cornea frequently becomes less con- vex and the refractive power being as a consequence decreased ?hereUna is not far enough back to receive the sharply-defined maFe of near objects. In such cases the persons are long-sighted,

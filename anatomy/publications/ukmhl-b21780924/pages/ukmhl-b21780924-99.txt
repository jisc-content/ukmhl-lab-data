THE TEETH AND MASTICATION 91 molars which thoroughly crush and grind it. Now this grinding could not be carried on effectually if the lower jaw were capable of a vertical motion only. But if we observe the motion of the jaw during the grinding of the food, we shall find that it moves a little to the right and left, and also forward and backward. The broad and rough surfaces of the molar teeth are consequently caused to slide over each other, thus thoroughly grinding the food which may be between them. The carnivorous animals have not broad molars like ours. They bite and tear the flesh on which they feed, generally giving the jaw an up and down motion only. The herbivorous animals, on the other hand, have very large and perfect molars, and they give to the lower jaw a much greater variety of motion than we do. This may be readily observed in the cow, sheep, goat, and horse. During mastication the food must be continually moved about so that every portion of it may be brought between the molar teeth. This is effected by the muscles of the tongue, cheeks, and lips. Fig. 90.â€”Enamel Fibres. Magnified 350 diameters. A, the sides, and d, the ends of the fibres. The action of the muscles concerned in mastication would generally be regarded as a voluntary action; but it is often partly or wholly an involuntary act, since it not unfrequently continues for some time while we give no thought whatever to it, as for example, when we are eating and engaged in reading at the same time. In this case the reading may absorb the attention to such an extent that we become unconscious of the continued action of the lower jaw.

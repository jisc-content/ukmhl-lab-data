11 GENERAL EUILD OF THE HUMAN BODY hearing. The sympathetic or ganglionic system supplies the involuntary muscles. The two parts of the nervous system are not entirely separate, being connected by numerous nerve filaments. By means of the nervous system we receive impressions from the external world through the organs of the senses. The nervous system also, by its connection with the muscles, causes and controls the motions of the body. THE SYSTEMS OF ORGANS. SUMMAEY. The osseous system . . The muscular system .

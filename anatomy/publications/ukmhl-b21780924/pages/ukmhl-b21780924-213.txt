THE EYE AND VISION 20$ the choroid membrane and the iris ; the inner is termed the ^^^^^Tlie sclerotic coat (Gr. skleros, hard) or tunic of the eye is a strong opaque fibrous membrane which extends over the whole of the ball with the exception of about one-sixth of its surface in front. This coat is the thickest, and by far the strongest, and is the one on which the maintenance of the form of the eye depends. The cornea (Lat. corjm, a horn—a transparent horny coat) is continuous with the sclerotic coat, and covers the front of the eye- Fig. 189.—The Choroid Membrane and Iris, exposed hy the removal of the Sclerotic and Cornea. c, part of the sclerotic thrown back ; b, ciliary muscle; c, iris ; e, one of the ciliary nerves ; /, blood-vessel. ball. It forms the prominent spherical surface before mentioned, and is clear and transparent. It is not supplied with blood- vessels. The choroid coat is a dark-brown membrane lying within and against the sclerotic. It consists of a thickly set network of blood- vessels, supported by connective tissue, and loaded with cells con- taining a dark pigment or colouring matter. One use of this coat, as we shall presently learn, is to darken the chamber of the eye, and thus prevent the reflection of light. Just before the choroid coat reaches the edge of the cornea, it becomes modified, being

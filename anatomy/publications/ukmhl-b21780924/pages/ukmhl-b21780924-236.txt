228 ELEMENTARY I'lIYSIOLOGY The raucous membrane of the stomach and the intestine, and the ducts of the glands which lie embedded in it, are lined by a layer of elongated cylindrical or prismatic cells, arranged with their long axes at right angles to the free surface. Such cells . ]■ i (elf ' Fig. 221. —Columnar Epithelium from the Intestinal Villus of a Eabbit. form what is called columnar epithelium, and may exist in a single regular layer, or in several layers more or less irregularly arranged. The free surfaces of the epithelial cells of certain parts are clothed with minute hair-like processes called cilia, there being Fig. 222.—CUiated Epithelial Cells from the Trachea of a Cat. from ten to thirty attached to each individual cell. These cilia are perpetually in motion, lashing to and fro m such a manner that all those of the same surface tend to propel any particles which come into contact with them in one direction. Thus, if the ciliated epithelium in question happens to Ime a cavity, all foreign matter resting on the surface is urged on towards the orifice of the cavity.

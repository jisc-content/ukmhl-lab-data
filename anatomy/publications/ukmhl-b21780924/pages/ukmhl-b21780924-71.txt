THE ANATOMY OF THE FACE AND NECK 63 The lower part of the pharynx is continuous with a fleshy tube tvhich leads downward from it, passing completely through the thorax and the diaphragm, and then entering the stomach. This tube is called the oesophagus, gullet, or food-passage. Thus, after food or drink has passed througli the mouth, between the tongue and the palate, it enters the pharynx, and is then con- veyed to the stomach by means of the oesophagus.

There is another tube that leads downward from the pharynx. It is situated just in front of the oesophagus, and is that hard tube which may be felt in the front part of the throat. This is called the trachea (Gr. iradius, rough) or windpipe. The upper part of the trachea is larger than the rest, and forms that promin-

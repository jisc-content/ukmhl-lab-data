144 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY From the above statements we learn that the lungs contain about 230 cubic mches after an ordinary inspiration; that is the 200 inches of stationary air, together with the 30 inches of tidal air. By taking a very deep inspiration we can add al)out 100 mches to this, bringing tlie total up to 330 cubic inches, thus inflating the lungs to their full capacity. The term complemental air has been applied to the 100 inches added by the deep in- spiratory effort. An adult person at rest breathes about fifteen times a minute ; and, knowing this, we can easily calculate the total quantity of air inspired and expired in a given time. For example, in twenty-four hours this would amount to 30 X 15 X 60 X 24 = 648,000 c. ins., or 375 c. ft. This quantity, however, is largely increased, and may be more than doubled, by physical exertion. Children breathe much more rapidly than adults- about thirty times a minute. ■ SUMMARY.

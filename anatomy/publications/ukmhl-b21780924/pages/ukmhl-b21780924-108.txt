The outer of these, which, of course, lies next the peritoneal coat, is muscular; the next is composed of areolar tis- sue, and the inner coat is a mucous membrane. 'I"he muscular coat of the stomach consists of three sets of involuntary muscular fibres. The outer set run longitudinally from the cardiac orifice to the pylorus, and are continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus. The middle set of fibres encircle all parts of the stomach, and are especially numer- ous at the pyloric end. The inner set consist of oblique fibres. They are continuous with the circu- lar fibres of the oesophagus, and exist chiefly at the car- diac end of the stomach. By means of these mus- cles the contents of the stomach are kept in a continuous circular motion, passing from the cardiac end to the pylorus along the greater curvature, and back to the cardiac end along the lesser curvature : and, as with the oesophagus, these motions are best maintain- ed when the stomach is moderately distended with food - substances, so that the muscles can grasp them on all sides. The walls of the sto- mach are capable of great distension ; consequently it can adapt itself to the quantity of food it contains, Fig. 96.—A Section through the "Walls of the Stomach.

THE EYE AND VISION corresponding motion. From this experiment we learn that, a convex lens will form an inverted image of a luminous object; and that, tlie nearer the object is to the lens, the greater is the distance between the lens and the image. Next, substitute for the lens just used another one with more convex surfaces, and notice that the distance at which the distinct image is formed is less than in the preceding experiment. And by repeating the experiment with a variety of lenses we shall learn that, the more convex the lens, the shorter the distance at which the sharp image is produced ; and vice versd. Fig. 195. We will now turn our attention to a piece of apparatus by which we can illustrate the uses of the various parts of the eye : In fig. 196 A is a water-tight box, the back, B, of which consists of a square of glass, the rest being made of wood or metal blackened on the inside In the centre of the front, F, is a circular hole, over which is fitted a watch-glass with its convex surface turned outward. G is a sheet of ground glass which may be moved forward and backward in the box so as to receive images formed at various distances from the watch-glass. D represents two 'diaphragms ' with different apertures, which, being placed behind the watch-glass, mly be used to limit the amount of light admitted ; and L is a convex lens attached

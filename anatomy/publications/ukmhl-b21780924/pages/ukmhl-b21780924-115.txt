THE INTESTINES AND INTESTINAL DIGESTION 107 The mucous coat of both large and small intestines also resembles that of the stomach in that it consists chiefly of glands. But the glands are of various kinds; some are tubular, and arranged parallel with each other. Others {Peyer's glands) are somewhat globular or ovoid in form, and are distributed singly {solitary) or in groups {Feyer's patches). Others, again, are minutely lobulated {Brunner's glands), and are so large as to be* visible to the naked eye. The ducts of all these glands (excepting the Beyer's glands, which have no ducts) open on the internal surface of the intestines and thus pour their secretions into the alimentary canal.

The nature of the secretions of these glands is not well under- stood. Some of them probably secrete mucus only ; others are sup- posed to resemble the salivary glands and the pancreas in function. The interior surface of the small intestine is covered also with a multitude of minute projections called villi (Lat. shaggy hair) which give the surface a fine velvety appearance. These, however, will be described in our next lesson, as they are engaged in the absorption of nutritious matter rather than in the digestion of food. When the partially digested food passes from the stomach, through the pylorus, it almost immediately mingles with two very important digestive fluids, called the bile and the pancreatic fluid

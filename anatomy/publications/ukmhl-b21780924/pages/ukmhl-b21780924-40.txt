32 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY tibia forms, witli the femur, the hinge knee-joint wliich corre- sponds with the similar ioint of the elbow. The knee-joint is protected by a small bone, the patella (Lat. a little plate), called also the knee-cap and the knee-pan. The bones of t\\e foot consist of the /arsal or ank/e-l?ones, the metatarsal or instep-bones, and the phalanges of the toes. The tarsal bones are seven in number. One of them is much larger than the others, and, projecting backward, forms the heel. 1 he metatarsal bones are similar to the metacarpal bones of the hand. They are five in number, and are connected with the phalanges of the toes The number of bones in the toes is the same as in the fingers and thumb, the great toe representing the thumb. The foot is arched in form, and is prevented from falling flat by powerful ligaments. This arched form gives great strengtli combined with elasticity.

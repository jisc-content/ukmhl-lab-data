ET.EMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 30 The phalanges {(ir. pJialanx^ a line of soldiers ; a rank) of the fingers are united to the metacarpal bones. There are three of these in each finger and two in the thumb, making a total of fourteen for each hand. The bones of the lower extremities are :— Pelvic or hip bones. Femur or thigh-bone. Patella or knee-cap. Tibia or shin-bone. Fibula or splint-bone. Tarsal or afikle-loJies. Metatarsal or instep-bones. Phalanges or toe-bones. The bones of the calf. The pelvic or hip-bones are also called the ossa innominata or innominate bones (Lat. in, not : and nomen, a name). If we Fig. 33-—Pelvis and Sacrum, seen from before. I, sacrum ; 2, ilium; 3, ischium ; 4, Pubis ; 5, acetabulum. examine these in the skeleton of a young child, we find that each OS innominatum is composed of three distinct parts which meet at a deep cup-lik6 depression called the acetabulum (Lat^, a cup for holding vinegar). The broad upper portiori is called the ilinm (Gr eUeo, I twist); the lower part, the ischium (Gr. uchton, the hip); and that portion which is joined to the other innominate ^"""ThtlcSulum receives the rounded head of the thigh bone. The bones of the pelvis are supported like a bridge on the legs as pillars, and serve in turn as a support.for the internal organs of the abdomen or lower part of the trunk.

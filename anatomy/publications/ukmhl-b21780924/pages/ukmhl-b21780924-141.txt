THE BLOOD-VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 133 auricles respectively, and thence into the ventricles. But as the auricles receive more than passes at once into the ventricles, their walls become fully distended. They then contract simultaneously, each one forcing its contents into the ventricle below it, the force of this contraction not being sufficient to send the blood back into the great veins, where it would be resisted by the pressure of the fluid they already contain. As the ventricles fill, the cusps of the tricuspid and mitral valves float up on the surface of the blood. Now follows the simultaneous contraction of the ventricles, the effect of which is to close the valves between them and the auricles, and also to open the semilunars at the entrances of the Fig. 126.—Diagram showing the Fig. 127.—Diagram showing the position of the Valves of the position of the Valves of the Heart while the walls are re- Heart during the contraction of laxed. the ventricles. great arteries. The cusps of the tricuspid and mitral valves are raised with such force that the chordae tendinese are tightly stretched, and the regurgitation of blood into the auricles is rendered im- possible by the meeting of the edges of the cusps. The chief use of the tendinous cords is to prevent the valves from going too far into the auricles. It will thus be seen that when the ventricles contract there is but one course on each side open to the blood, namely, that furnished by the great arteries—the pulmonary arteries and the aorta, on the right and left respectively. These vessels are not only filled with blood, and that almost suddenly, but their walls are distended, since the blood is forced into them

ELEMENTARY rilYSIOLOGY 132 finger along one of these in a direction opposite to the course of the blood we cause the blood to flow backward on the valves, thus filling them out, stopping the vein, causing it to swell out and present a knotted appearance. If we thus prevent the blood from passing through one of the veins of the arm, we do not interfere with the general circulation, as the veins are connected with each other by numerous branches, and thus the blood can readily take another course ; and, the total capacity of the veins being much greater than that of the Fig. 124.- -Vein with Valves open.

Some veins have no valves. Among these may be mentioned the vence cavce, the pulmonary veins, xhe portal vein which supplies the liver, the hepatic vein (Gr. hepar, the liver) which takes blood from the liver, and the renal veins (Lat. renes, kidneys) which lead from the kidneys to the vena cava inferior. , ,, j Having noticed the chief characters of the different blood- vessels, we now turn our attention to the action of the heart, commencing for convenience at that period immediately follovv-ing the contraction of the ventricles, and during which the heart is passive The cavities now dilate, and the blood flows freely from the vence cava; and the pulmonary veins into the right and kit

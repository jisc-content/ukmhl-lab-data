207 THE EYE AND VISION dilated. By these means the diameter of the pupil is made to vaiy from ird to o'^th of an inch, and the quantity of light admitted into the eyeball is regulated. The outer rim of the iris is firmly connected with the external coat of the eye, at the junction of the cornea with the sclerotic coat, by the ciliary ligament. The retina is a delicate membrane which lies within the choroid coat. It is only from ry^o^th to gLth of an inch thick, and covers the whole of the cho- roid with the exception of the ciliary processes. It consists of an --r^^^aa^— expansion ofthe fibres of the optic Fig. 191.—Ciliary Processes and nerve, supported by an extremely Eetina as seen from behind, delicate connective tissue.

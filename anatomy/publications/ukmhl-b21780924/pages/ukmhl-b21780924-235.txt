EPITHELIUM 227 sometimes in several superimposed layers (laminated epithelium). Each cell has within it a portion of denser substance called the nucleus. The different varieties of epithelia are classified according to the form and arrangement of their cells, or according to the functions which these" cells perform. Thoee epithelial structures which consist of flat scale-like cells are known as squamous, or tesselated epithelia. In these the cells are either cemented together by some kind of intercellular substance, or they are united by partial fusion, or by the inter- fJ9--Squamous Epithelium Fig. 220.-Overlapping Squamous of the Peritoneum.

The epidermis (fig. 150) is of this character; and it will be remembered that, in this instance, there are numerous superimposed layers of cells The epithelial lining of the heart, blood-vessels, lymphatics, and all serous cavities, consists of very flat squamous cells, often arranged m a single layer, and to this the special term endothelium is more commonly applied. In the linings of the ducts and cavities of glands we meet with spheroidal cells, which have often become polygonal bv riiutual pressure; and as these cells are the active agents by which the various secretions are prepared from the blood that circulates- in the neighbouring capillaries, the epithelial tissue which they torm is often spoken of as secreting or glandular epithelium Examples of this variety may be seen in the peptic glands of the stomach (fig loi), in the tubules of the kidney, and in the salivary glands.

THE INTESTINES AND INTESTINAL DIGESTION. The general form and arrangement of the mtestines have been described in Lesson XIII. . Both large and small intestines, hke the stomach, consist ot four coats. These coats also correspond with those of the stomach, being arranged as follows ;â€” 1. Outer serous coat, formed by the peritoneum, 2. Muscular coat, composed of (a) External longitudinal fibres and ib) Literrial circular fibres. 3. Areolar layer. 4 Mucous membrane, forming the mterior surface. The mucous membrane of the small intestine is m part drawn up into folds, like that of the stomach, but to such .-n extent that thev do not disappear when the tube is distenaed. These lolds are called the valvulse conniventes. They serve to increase the area of the secreting surface, to prevent the food from passing too rapidly through the intestine, and to assist the mmng of the food with the digestive fluids which are poured into the mtestines.

ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 214 White light is composed of a multitude of colours, the colours of the rainbow—as may be proved by allowing a beam of such light to pass through a prism of glass. If we look steadily for some time on a bright red spot on a sheet of white paper, and then turn the eyes aside to a clear portion of the paper, or to the ceiling, we see a green spot. The sensibility of that portion of the retina on v/hich the red rays fell has been exhausted .so far as those rays are concerned, and it remains sensitive only to the other colours which compose white light. Consequently, when the white light from the paper falls on the exhausted ])ortion of the retina, the red rays produce no effect, and we see the comple- mentary colour to red ; that is, the colour produced by the com- bined effect of all the other rays of the white light. Conversely, if we exhaust a portion of the retina with green rays, we produce the complementary red image. Some persons are colour-blind, that is, they cannot dis- tinguish between two or more colours, different rays affecting the retina in exactly the same manner. This is probably due to a defect in the retina. SUMMARY. Eyeball. Muscles. Blood-vessels. Nerves. Fatty tissue. Lachrymal or tear apparatus. Consist of folds of the skin.

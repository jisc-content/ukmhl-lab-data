229 EPITHELIUM The cells of ciliated epithelium are generally cylindrical or columnar in form, but are sometimes squamous or spheroidal. This kind of epithelium lines all the air-passages of the lungs, and the respira- tory tracks of the nostrils; also the cavities of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. from what has been said it will be seen that the function of epithelium may be the protection of other tissues, the production of motion, or the preparation of a secretion; or two of these functions may be performed by one and the same epithelial lining. Some epithelial cells have also a sensory function, such as those which line the olfactory region of the nose, and those which form the sensory surface (retina) of the eyeball. SUMMAEY.

Consists of cells of various shapes. Simple—a single layer of cells. Laminated — cells arranged in layers. Squamous—flat scale-like cells. heart, blood-vessels, lymphatics, serous cavities {Endothelium). Spheroidal—globular or polygonal cells. Found largely in glands, and hence called glandular epithelium. Columnar — elongated cells. Lines stomach, intestines, and the ducts of glands. Ciliated—free surfaces clothed with vibra- tile cilia. Cilia perpetually in motion. Air-passages and cavities of the brain. Protection. Secretion. Sensation. Motion (ciliated). QUESTIONS ON LESSON XXXVIIL 1. What is epithelium ?

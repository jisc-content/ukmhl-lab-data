6o ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY (intercostal muscles) which unite iheni. These, together with the back-bone iDchind, and the l)reast-l)one in front, form the walls of the upper portion of the great cavity. The lower portion has no such firm framework. It is supported by the vertebral column behind ; but, round the sides and front, the walls consist of flesh and fibrous connective tissue only. The flesh consti- tutes the muscles of iho abdomen, abdomen being the name of the lower portion of the great body cavity. ;pig. —The Cavities of the Human Body. I, bodies of the vertebrae ; 2, spinous processes of the vertebrae ; 3, spinal canal ; 4, breast-bone ; 5, diathraprm ; 6, thora.\ ; 7, abdomen. Fig. 74.—The Diaphragm, &c. a, sixth dorsal vertebra ; b, fourth lumbar vertebra : c lower cartilaginous extremity of the breast-bone (ensiform cartilage) ; d ({, a great blood-vessel (aoria) passing through the diaphragm; e, oesophagus; /, opening through which a great vem (mferior vena cava) passes; i, 2, and 3, tendinous portion of the diaphragm ; 4 and 5, muscular portion of the dia- phragm ; 6 and 7, the pillars of the diaphragm. These are povierful muscles which connect the ten- dinous portion of the diaphragm with the spinal column. 8, g, and 10, intercostal muscles. Now insert the point of a knife just at the lower extremity of the sternum, and cut through that bone toward the throat, thrusting the knife no deeper than is absolutely necessary. The front walls of the cavity, consisting of the ribs and the intercostal muscles, may now be carefully cut away, so as to_ ex- pose the interior. If we now carefully remove the organs which are contained in this portion of the body cavity (the heart and the lungs) we shall find tha.

ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 68 diaphragm. It is somewhat conical in form, and is placed Nvith Its broad portion or base uppermost, and with its apex or pointed end turned downward and toward the left. Its size is about equal to that of the closed fist, and in the adult it weighs about nine ounces. The heart contains four cavities through which the blood circulates ; and by its powerful contraction it forces this fluid through all the blood-vessels of the body. The thorax contains the great blood-vessels which are con- nected with the heart. These all enter or leave at the base, and are called arteries if they convey blood from the heart, and veins if they convey it to the heart. Fig. 78. â€”Transverse Section through the Thorax. The section is carried above the heart, but below the division of the trachea. I, sternum ; 2, body of dqrsal vertebra ; 3, spinous process ; 4, spinal cavity; 5, rib; 6, inner layer of pleura ; 7, outer layer of pleura; 8, pericardium; 9, right bronchus ; 10 left bronchus; 11, oesophagus ; 12, heart; 13, aorta, ascending; 14, aorta, descending; 15, left lung; 16, right lung ; 17, pulmonary arteries. The oesophagus passes down the neck close behind the trachea, then between the lungs behind the heart, and through the diaphragm to the stomach beneath. The organs just mentioned completely fill the thorax during life; but, when the chest of a dead animal is cut open, the lungs collapse, even if they are uninjured. If, however, a suitable tube be inserted in the trachea, the lungs may again be inflated by blowing into them. Both heart and lungs are invested by double membranes.

13 THE SKELETON kind of curved wedge, formed by the next five vertebra fused together into one firm mass of bone. This wedge is called the sacrum (Lat. sacred), and to its lowest and narrowest end is attached the coccyx (Lat. a cuckoo), which consists of four very im- perfectly formed vertebras, corresponding with the tail in other animals. The sides of the sa- crum are united with the two large hip-bones, and form a basin-like cavity called the pelvis (Lat. a basin). These will be more conveniently described with the bones of the limbs. In order to understand clearly the construction and uses of the vertebral column it will be neces- sary to notice the form of a single vertebra ; and though the vertebras diffei from each other in detail, yet all are constructed on the same plan, and a gene- ral description of one Avill answer for all. A vertebra consists of a bony body from which spring two arches^ the latter uniting in such a manner as to form a kind of ring which encloses the spinal cavity. From the outer circumference of this bony ring are given off three projections, which are called processes. The body is the front portion of the vertebra, and the process which projects from the arch, exactly opposite the Fig. 9.—The Verte- bral Column, viewed from the left side. C 1, first cervical vertebra ; D i, first dorsal vertebra ; 1, I, first lumbar vertebra ; S i, first sacral vertebra,' Co I, first coccygeal vertebra.

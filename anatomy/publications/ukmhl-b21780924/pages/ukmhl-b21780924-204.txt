Tasie ,, ,, the tongue. Hearing „ ,, the ear. ^ Sig/it ,, the eye. 1. The irritation of sensory fibres. 2. The transmission of this irritation to the brain. 3. The translation of the irritation into a state of consciousness. Objective—Caused by irritation produced by outside objects. Subjective —Caused by a disturbed condition of the cerebrum. Terminal filaments—probably ending in the cells of the skin. . , 1 • Pacinian bodies—visible to naked eye-mtheskm of the hands and feet. Touch corpuscles—smaller—abundant in highly sen- sitive parts of skin. SENSITIVENESS OF SKIN | Thinness of the epidermis. -depends on The number of nerve endings in a given area.

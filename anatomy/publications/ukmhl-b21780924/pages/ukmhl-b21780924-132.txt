ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 124 We may now examine the blood-vessels at the Ijase of the heart. If some of them appear to be small, portions may be cut down till we arrive at the pomt where the smaller vessels unite to form a large one. In this way we may readily reduce the number of blood-vessels to about seven. .Some of these have very thick, firm, and clastic walls, which retain their circular form although the vessels are quite empty. These are the arteries, which convey the blood from the heart. The other vessels have thinner walls, which are comparatively inelastic and limp. These are the veins, which bring the blood to the heart. It is now necessary to learn which is the right and which the left side of the heart. On the surface will be seen two grooves, on opposite sides, one Fig. 116.—The Human Heart from behind. I, right ventricle ; 2, left ventricle ; 3, 3', and 3", the pulmonary arteries and their branches 1 4 and 4", the aorta ; 5, right auricle ; 6 is placed on the division between the right and left auricles ; 7, superior vena cava ; 8, inferior vena cava ; 9, hepatic vein ; 10, 11, and 12, right pulmonary veins ; 13 and 14, left pulmonary veins ; +, the coronary arteries. situated in front and the other behind. Inside the heart, extending between these grooves, is a fleshy partition which separates two cavities called the ventricles (Lat. ventriculus, a little belly)—the right and the left. These ventricles constitute the greater part of the heart, and are much stronger and more muscular (fleshy) than the auricles. We may now readily distinguish between the right and the left ventricles by pressing their walls between the finger and thumb, the walls of the left ventricle being much thicker than those of the right. Now hold the heart before you in the position it would occupy (see fig. 115), supposing it to be the heart of a person facing you : that is, with its base uppermost and its apex inclined to the left (your right), the left ventricle being

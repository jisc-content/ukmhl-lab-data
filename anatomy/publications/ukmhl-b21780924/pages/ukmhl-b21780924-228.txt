220 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY called the perilymph (Gr. peri, around ; and lyniplia, clear water). The membranous lahyrinlh is itself filled with a liquid called the endolymph ((jr. endo, within ; and lynipha). A number of minute crystals of cari>onale of lime, called otoliths ((Jr. ous, the ear; and lithos, stone) are suspended in the endolymph of the membranous labyrinth. Fig. 211.—Plan of the Right Membranous Labyrinth. Branches of the auditory nerve supply fibres to the membra- nous labyrinth. The terminations of these fibres end in cells which are provided with delicate hair-like processes projecting into the endolymph, some of them lying in close proximity to the otoliths. We may now trace the path along which the sound vibrations travel. The waves collected by the pinna are reflected into the auditory canal, at the extremity of which they impinge against the • Fig. 212.—Diagram illustrating the relative positions of the various parts of the Ear. 1, auditory canal : 2, tympanic membrane ; malleus ; 4, incus ; 5, stapes ; 6, fenestra ovalis; 7, fenestra rotunda; 8, Eustachian tube ; 9, membranous labyrinth; 10, semi- circular canal; 11, vestibule ; 12, cochlea. ■um. The vibrating membrane then communicates its motion the chain of small bones, by which it is transmitted to the peri- 'j mph of the inner ear. This fluid comrimnicates the vibration to

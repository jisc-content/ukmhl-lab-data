80 ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY Calciam carbonate (carbonate of lime) is composed of the metal calcium together with carbon and oxygen. It exists largely in the Iwnes and teeth. Clialk is a variety of this compound Calcium phosphate (phosphate of lime) consists of calcium, phosphorus, and oxygen. It forms more than fifty per cent, of the weight of bone. Bone ash (see page 40) consists chiefly of this compound and calcium carbonate. Sodium chloride or common salt consists of the metal sodium and a yellowish-green gas called chlorine. It is present in small ^Md^nWiies in \-i&^x\y all parts of the body. , , , ,1,^ Many other inorganic substances exist in the body ; and the most important of these will be mentioned in connection with the special functions in which they are concerned.

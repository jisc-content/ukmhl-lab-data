The heart is a hollow muscular organ which, by its contraction, forces the blood through the whole system of blood-vessels. A general description of this organ has already been given in Lesson XII., and we shall now pro- ceed to study its structure and action. The student is strongly recom- mended to procure a sheep's heart from the butcher, and dissect it with the help of the simple instructions here given. Many of the sheep's hearts sold have a deep cut on the front. This is made on opening the carcase of the animal, while Fig. 113.-The Sheep's Heart, carelessly chopping through the br^^^^^^^^^^ viewed from behind.

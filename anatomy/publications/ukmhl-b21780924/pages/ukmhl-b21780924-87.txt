THE CHEMISTRY OK THE BODY 79 The fats and oils are sometimes called hydro-carbons. They consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but the proportion \i oxygen is small. ^ . , , •. ,, ..^ The amyloids (Gr. aniulon{ starch, and eidos, form) include those compounds which resemble starch in chemical composition. They contain the same three elements that form fats and oils, but the proportion of oxygen is larger. In these compounds hydrogen and oxygen are present in the same proportion in which they com- bine to form water. The chief amyloids in the body are glycogen glucose or grape-sugar, and lactose or milk-sugar. The nitrogenous compounds are generally classified into proteids or albuminoids and gelatinoids. The albuminoids include all those compounds which resemble albumen or white of egg in composition. They are found in all the hvmg tissues of the body, and consist of carbon, hydrogen oxygen, and mtroge^t, together with a small proportion of sulphur ox phosphorus. The chief albuminoids of the body are- Albumen, found in the blood and 77tost tissues. Globulin, found in the blood and many of the tissues. Myosin, found principally in muscles. Fibrin, formed in blood as it coagulates or clots. Casein, found in the milk. The gelatinoids are those compounds which resemble eela- tme. The chief are :— ° Gelatine, formed by boiling bone. Chondrin, found in cartilage. The inorganic or mineral compounds found in the body are derived from our food and drink. Many of these pass through the body without undergoing any change, but others form a necessary part of the structure of certain tissues.

77 BODY THE CHEMISTRV OF ft THE gas will burn with a pale blue flame, and form a deposit of water on the sides of the bottle. Hydrogen combines with oxygen {from the air) when it kirns hence water is a compound consisting- of hydrogen and oxygen. ' {c). Fill another jar with hydrogen, and pass into it a lighted taper. The taper is extinguished as soon as it enters the gas, but the gas itself burns. Thus we learn that hydrogen is not a supporter of combustion. (Fig. 83.) If water contains oxygen, how is it that water will not support combustion ? We answer this by saying that the oxygen in the water is not free, but is in combination with hydrogen. Air supports combustion because the oxygen it contains is free, the air being a simple mixture of two gases, and not a chemical compound. Fig. 82. — Showing how to prepare and collect Hydrogen gas.

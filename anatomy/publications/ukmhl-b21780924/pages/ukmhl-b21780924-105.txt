97 THE SALIVARY GLANDS also assists in forming the food into a soft mass previous to swal- lowing. The rate of the secretion of the saliva is from one to two pounds daily. The secretion is probably continuous, but is always increased by the introduction of a substance into the mouth. This substance need not necessarily be digestible or even tasty, for the saliva may be readily produced by the sucking of a glass bead or a pebble ; and even the odour of a savoury dish will ' make the mouth water.' The salivary glands of children do not act till about the fourth or the sixth month. It would seem, therefore, that children should not be fed with foods containing much starch before that age. We shall, however, learn that the saliva is not the only fluid which is capable of digesting starch. GLANDS (Function) GLANDS (Forms) SALIVARY GLANDS SALIVA SUMMARY. Secreting. Excreting Ductless .

THE TRACHEA AND LUNGS form capillary networks which surround and he on the vvalls of thc air-ceUs. These walls of the air-cells are extreniely thm as are also the walls of the capillary vessels, and thus the blood is brousrht almost in contact with the inspired air nis in these capillaries that the venous blood becomes con- verted into bright arterial blood, by exchanging carbonic acid gas collected in the tissues of all parts of the body for oxygen gas absorbed from the air contained in the air-cells. ^, . . , The blood thus changed is collected by small veins, formed bv the union of the capillaries ; and these veins unite, forming lar-er veins, ultimately giving rise to the pulmonary veins, which pour their contents direcdy into the left auricle of the heart. Although we are continually expiring and inspiring air, yet the Fig. 133.—The Pulmonary Circulation.

Ihe arrows indicate the direction of the blood-stream. The shading represents venous blood. lungs are never empty—in fact, the amount of air which enters and leaves the lungs during ordinary breathing is small compared with that which remains after each expiration. The air which passes in and out of the lungs in ordinary quiet breathing is called the tidal air, and amounts to from 20 to 30 cubic inches in an adult person. After each expiration, however, about 200 cubic inches still remain in the lungs, this being termed the stationary air. By making a very deep expiration we can expel about a half of this (the supplemental air), and the lungs then contain about 100 inches of residual air which cannot be expelled.

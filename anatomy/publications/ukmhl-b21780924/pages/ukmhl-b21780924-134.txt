To these/fl/Z/fo arc attached very fine tendinous threads (chordae tendinese), which are again connected at their other and upper ends with thin membranous Jlaps or cusps. The cusps are three in number, and lie loosely against the walls of the ventricle, but it will be readily understood that a Fig. 118. -The Human Heart.

Under these circumstances the tendmous cords are stretched, and the edges of the cusps meet so as to stop the commumca-

After the food leaves the stomach, it passes through about twenty-six feet of tubing called the intestines, which consist of the small intestine (about twenty feet in length), and the large intestine (about six feet). The circulatory or blood system consists of the heart and blood-vessels. The heart is a hollow, muscular organ, provided with valves. It serves as a kind of force-pump to distribute the blood to all parts of the body. The blood-vessels consist of arteries, veins and capillaries. The arteries convey blood from the heart; and they divide and subdivide into smaller and smaller branches, till at last they form very mi- nute vessels called capillaries. These capillaries unite, forming small veins ; and by the junction of these, larger and larger vessels are formed, which at length discharge their contents into the heart. Veins, therefore, are vessels which bring blood to the heart : and capillaries are the minute blood-vessels which connect the small arteries and veins together. The absorptive system consists chiefly of vessels which collect dis- solved nutritious matter from various parts of the body, and convey it into the blood system. The nourishing material is thus distributed throughout the system to repair waste and to further growth. The respiratory system consists principally of the larynx, trachea or wind-pipe, and the lun^s. The larynx, sometimes called the voice-box, be- cause it contains the '■cords' or mem- branes by means of which the voice is produced, is the enlarged, upper part of the passage leading from the mouth Muscles and the Forearro, their

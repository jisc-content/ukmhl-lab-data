THE HEART AND ITS DISSECTION 12'/ tion between the ventricle and the auricle above it. The three cusps thus form a valve called the tricuspid valve ; and, from the arrangement we have just observed, it is clear that this valve will allow a free passage of blood from auricle to ventricle, but not in the opposite direction. If we now prolong the cut towards the origin of the pulmonary arteries until we lay open the trunk which gives rise to these vessels, we shall find another set of valves called .the semilunar valves (Lat. semi, half; and hina. n Fig. 119.—Interior of the Riglit Side of tlie Human Heart.

' ' the moon). These are three semi-circular membranous pouches, with their convex surfaces turned toward the ventricle. They therefore offer no obstruc- tion to the blood as it passe?, from the ventricle, but a backward tendency of the blood would fill the pou.hes, causing their edges to meet, and thus closine the passage into the ventricle. ^ Now remove the left auricle completely, with its pulmonary veins, and

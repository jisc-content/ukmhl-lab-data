17^ ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY Some nerves are purely sensory, that is, consist of sensory fibres only. Other nerves consist of sensory and motor fibres, and can consequently convey nerve impulses in both directions, only, of course, not by the same fibres. Such nerves are termed mixed nerves. The nerves which enable us to see, hear, and smell are purely sensory ; but most of the nerves in the body are composed of mixed fibres.

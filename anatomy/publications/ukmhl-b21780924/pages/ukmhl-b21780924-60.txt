ELEMENTARY PHYSIOLOGY 52 composed of bundles of fibres, but that each l?undk is made up of still smaUer bundles, eaeh of which is distmcdy visible to the naked eye. These smallei- bundles are called fasciculi (T.at. fasciculus, a htde bundle) ; and the fineness or coarseness of a muscle depends on the relative sizes of these small bundles of fibres. Thus, in the powerful muscles of the leg, the fascicuU are much larger than in the softer muscles of the cheeks. If it is desired to study the structure more minutely, it will be necessary to take pjg, 56.—A few Muscular Fibres, being part of a smaller Fasci- culus, more liigMy magnified, a, end view of fibres ; 5, side view of fibres ; c. a fibre split into fibrils.

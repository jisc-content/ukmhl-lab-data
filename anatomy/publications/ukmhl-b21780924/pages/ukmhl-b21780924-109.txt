THE CESOPHAGUS AND STOMACH lOI The circular muscular fibres at the intestinal end of the stomach form a strong band which serves to keep the pylorus closed. Such circular muscles are called sphincters {Gr. a tight band). This sphincter remains at first firmly closed during digestion; but, as the process continues, it slowly relaxes, thus allcJwing the digested portions to pass through into the intestines; and, towards the termina- tion, it allows all the con- tents of the stomach to pass. The time during which substances remain in the stomach varies consider- ably with the nature of the food and the method of cooking. Usually it is not less than one hour.

The mucous membrane of the stomach is smooth, level, and soft, when the organ is moderately distended ; but is drawn up into longitudinal folds when the stomach is empty. It consists almost entirely of minute glands, which secrete mucus to keep the surface moist, and, during digestion, a powerful fluid known as the gastric juice or gastric fluid. These glands are called gastric glands or peptic glands (Gr. pepto, I cook, or digest). They are tubu- lar glands, the openings of which may be seen on the surface of the mucous membrane by the aid of a lens.

335 the abdomen either along with the aorta or separated from it by a fasciculus of the diaphragm ; each nerve then expands into the semilunar ganglion. The lesser Splanch- nic nerve arises by two roots from the tenth and eleventh ganglions ; these unite on the side of the last dorsal ver- tebra ; this small nen’e then enters the abdomen through the crus of the diaphragm, communicates with the pre- ceding, and ends in the renal plexus. In the abdomen we find the semilunar and the lumbar ganglions of each side ; the semilunar ganglion of each side is situated on the diaphragm, and partly on the aorta on either side of the coeliac axis, and above and behind the supra-renal capsule ; these are the largest ganglions on the sympa- thetic ; they communicate with each other by several hlaments on which small ganglions are placed ; this com- munication surrounds the coeliac a.xis, and is termed the solar plexus; this plexus is situated behind the stomach, in front of the aorta and above the pancreas ; from it numerous nen^es pass off in various directions; these nerves accompany the blood vessels, and form plexuses around each, which are named according to their desti- nation, hepatic, splenic, and gastric ; these plexuses communicate with the eighth pair ; from the solar plexus branches descend in front of the aorta ; these subdivide at the renal and mesenteric arteries, accompany these vessels, form plexuses around each, w^hich are named accordingly’ the renal, superiorj and inferior mesenteric plexuses; into each of these, branches from the lumbar ganglions enter. The lesser splanchnic nen’e enters the renal plexus ; from each renal plexus descends the sper- matic plexus, which in the male descends in the sperma- tic cord and supplies the testicle ; in the female it enters the pelvis and supplies the ovarium and uterus. From the inferior mesenteric plexus branches descend to the edge of the pelvis, unite with others from the lumbar ganglions, and form a plexus around the internal iliac artery and its pelvic branches; this is termed the hj'po- gastric plexus ; it is joined by numerous filaments from the lumbar and sacral ganglions of the sympathetic, and it communicates with the pelvic branches of the sacral plexus.

7 ou the side of the nose ; it arises from the canine fossa in the superior maxilla; the fibres pass for^vards, ex- panding' over the ala nasi, and are inserted by a thin aponeurosis into the dorsum of the nose, joining some fibres from the opposite side; use, to press the ala to- ward the septem, or to draw it from it, so that it may alternately enlarge or diminish the anterior nares. The insertion of this muscle is connected with the occipito- frontalis, and its origin with the following muscle. Levator Labii Superioris Alajolte Nasi, is long and thin, placed on the side of the nose, between the orbit and the upper lip; it arises by two origins, I. from the upper extremity of the nasal process of the superior maxilla; 2. broad, from the edge of the orbit, above the infra orbital hole; the fibres descend and converge a little, and are inserted into the ala nasi, and into the upper lip and orbicularis oris muscle : its name denotes its ^^se. The external or orbital origin of this muscle is covered by the orbicularis palpebrarum; the angular vein and artery separate its origins; the orbital head covers the infra-orbital nerve and vessels and the levator anguli oris muscle. Zygomaticus Minor is very small, and sometimes wanting; it arises from the upper part of the malar bone, passes doi\Tiwards and forwards, and is inserted into the upper lip near the commissure, uniting with the other muscles which are inserted there; use, to draw the angle of the mouth upwards and outwards, as in smiling. Zygomaticus Major, is long and narrow, and in- ferior to the last; arises tendinous and fleshy from the lower part of the malar bone, near the zygomatic su- ture : it descends obliquely forward, and is inserted into the angle of the mouth.â€” Use, to draw the corner of the mouth upwards and backwards. The zygomatic mus- cles are partly concealed at their origin by the orbicu- laris palpebrarum ; their insertion intermingles with the levator, depressor anguli, and orbicularis oris muscles; they lie on the malar bone, and cross the masseter and buccinator muscles; they are imbedded in much soft adipose substance. Levator Anguli Oris, is situated about the mid-

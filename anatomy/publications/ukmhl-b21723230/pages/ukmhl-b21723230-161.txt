143 importance in cases of wounds penetrating this cavity, or in making an examination during life to detect any sus- pected organic disease. Dissect the abdominal muscles off the peritonaeum; these can be easily separated lateral- ly and inferiorly; but anteriorly, particularly near the umbilicus, it will be found very difficult to detach the sheath of the rectus from this membrane ; the external surface of the peritonaeum, which is thus exposed, ap- pears rough and cellular, from its connexion to the super- incumbent muscles; three ligamentous cords are seen extending along it anteriorly and inferiorly, from the summit and sides of the urinary bladder towards the um- bilicus ; the central one of these is the remains of the urachus, and that on each side is the obliterated umbilical or hypogastric artery ; anteriorly and superiorly we per- ceive another ligamentous substance, ascending from the umbilicus obliquely backwards, and to the right side ; this is the remains of the umbilical vein ; it is at first placed between the peritonaeum and the muscles, but it soon sinks deep towards the liver, carrying around it a fold of peri- tonaeum, named the suspensory ligament of the liver, which will be seen when the peritonaeum is opened ; the epigastric vessels also may be observed ascending from each inguinal region, and branches of the internal mam- mary arteries descending on the surface of this mem- brane. Next open the peritonaeum by an incision from the ensiform cartilage to the umbilicus, and from this point carry another on each side obliquely downwards, to the spine of the ilium: on throwing down the inferior flap thus formed, we remark on its internal surface the projections of the three ligamentous cords which were before noticed as ascending from the bladder to the umbilicus ; we may also remark how the external of these cords, or the obliterated umbilical artery on each side, throws the lower part of the peritonaeum into pouches, two on each side, the external and internal inguinal pouches; the former lies between the ilium and the obliterated hypogastric vessel, the latter be- tween this cord and the fundus of the bladder. The external pouch is large and very concave internally, and appears to protrude towards the inguinal canal:

296 The anterior and external portion of each crue, which is in continuation with the corpus pyramidale, in like man- ner ascends and expands into fasciculi, which may be traced into the inferior, anterior, and external convolu- tions of each hemisphere. The uneven surface known by the name of convolutions appears to depend on the unequal length of these diverging fibres ; if they were all of equal extent the surface of the cerebrum would be smooth, but as some fall short of others, and all are co- vered by' the grey substance, an uneven or convoluted surface is the result. From this grey substance, which covers the surface of each convolution, the converging or descending fibres are described as arising, and thence passing towards the mesial line to unite with those from the opposite side ; the corpus callosum and the anterior and posterior commissures are supposed to be thus formed; in addition to these transverse processes there are se- veral other parts which may serve as media of communi- cation between different parts in each hemisphere of the brain, viz. the fornix, the taenia semicircularis, the pineal gland and its pedunculi, the infundibulum, the septum lucidum, &c. &c. VESSELS OF THE BRAIN. The brain is supplied with blood by the two vertebral and the two internal carotid arteries. The vertebral ar- teries are the first branches of the subclavian arteries ; each ascends through the series of foramina in the trans- verse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and passing through the foramen magnum into the cranium, they pro- ceed obliquely forwards and inwards and end in a common trunk called tbe basilar artery ; each vertebral first sends off two long and delicate branches, one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface of the spinal cord; these ex- tend the whole length of this organ, supplying it with blood, and sending out small branches along the several spinal nerves ; next to these branches each vertebral gives off the inferior artery of the cerebellum; this turns back- wards between the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory

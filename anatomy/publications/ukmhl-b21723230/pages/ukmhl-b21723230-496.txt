478 base articulates with the second phalanx, and presents a pulley-like surface, having two small cavities and a mid- dle ridge, such as the base of the second phalanx ; their posterior surface, convex, supports the nail, their anterior rough and irregularly concave, for the attachment of the flexor tendon and ligaments ; its anterior extremity or apex is irregularly tuberculated to support the extremity of the finger. The phalanges in structure resemble me- tacarpal bones ; the last are more cellular, and have no medullary canal; they are developed each from two points of ossification, one for the shaft, and one for the anterior extremity ; the posterior end is continued from the shaft. On the articulation between the metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the thumb there are generally two sesamoid bones, and sometimes one in the corresponding joint of the index finger; these bones like those in the foot, as well as in other situations, where they are occasionally found, as behind the condyles of the femur, in the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles, do not properly belong to the osseous system, they are rather accessories to the tendons of muscles ; they are found in the limbs only, and gene- rally in the direction of flexion ; they are developed from cartilage, which is deposited in tendinous or ligamentous structure, and are very slow to ossify; the patella has some resemblance to bones of this class, it is however more perfect, and is placed on the aspect of extension ? the sesamoid bones serve to strengthen the articulations to w'hich they are attached; they also increase the power of the muscles, by altering the direction of their tendons, and removing them further from the axis of the bone which they are intended to move.

327 fourth sacral, passes through the great sciatic notch in- ternal to the preceding ; it then re-enters the pelvis by the lesser sciatic notch, and passing upwards and for- wards along the internal surface of the tuber ischii to- waiâ€™ds the pubis, it divides into two branches, an inferior and superior ; the inferior ascends obliquely forwards and inwards along the ramus of the ischium to the peri- naeum, and is distributed to the muscles and integuments in that region, also to the scrotum ; the superior branch continues its course along the ramus of the pubis near- ly to the symphysis, it then passes forwards along the dorsum of the penis, increases in size as it approaches the glans penis, in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of which it terminates ; in the female the inferior branch of the pudic nerve supplies the labium, the superior, the clitoris. The great sciatic or posterior crural nerve is the principal branch of the sacral plexus, and the largest nerve in the body; it proceeds from the four superior sa- cral nerves, escapes from the pelvis below the pyriform muscle, sometimes through it, it then descends along the back of the thigh over the gemini/ quadratus, and ^ adductor raagnus as far as the ham, where it divides into the external and internal popliteal nerves; in this course this nerve is covered superiorly by the giutaeus maximus and the hamstrings, inferiorly by the fascia lata and the integuments ; the sciatic nerve sends off several cutane- ous and muscular branches, the latter supply the ham- strings, the gracilis, and the adductor magnus. The ex- ternal popliteal or the peronceal nerve descends obliquely out^vards along with the biceps tendon to the external condyle of the femur, it then turns forwards through the peronaeus longus, round the neck of the fibula, and di- vides into two branches, the musculo-cutaneous and an- terior tibial; the peronseal nerve, before it arrives at the head of the fibula, sends off two or three long branches, termed the external cutaneous nerves of the leg ; these descend along the outer and back part of the leg, and communicate with the external saphenus nerve a branch of the posterior tibial. The musculo-cutaneous nerve descends between the peronaeus longus and extensor digi-

509 gulus and os calcis. The fibula is broken usually at its lower third, and the broken end of this bone is situated on the astragalus. The synovial membrane is ruptured with laceration of the deltoid and anterior ligaments of the tibia, and of the posterior transverse band from the tibia, to the fibula. After the accident has taken place, contrac- tion of the gastrocnemii, solei and peronei muscles, by rotating the foot out and drawing it upwards, will offer resistance to reduction. If the tibia be dislocated out- wards, the malleolus internus must be broken offâ€™: the deltoid ligament is not ruptured ; but if the fibula be not broken, the external lateral, anterior, and posterior liga- ments of this bone are lacerated. In the forward dislo- cation, the fibula and usually the malleolus internus are broken. The tibia rests on the os naviculare and inter- nal cuneiform bone. The posterior part of the deltoid li- gament, and the transverse band from the tibia to the fibula are ruptured. Dislocation forwards is an accident of rare occurrence. It cannot happen when the foot is flexed on the tibia, for then the tibia sinks down on the back part of the astragnlus, and nothing but considerable force could raise it over the upper portion of the bone, which, in this position, extends like a bridge before it. Luxation backwards is even still more rare. Were such an accident to take place all the tibial ligaments would be broken, and the fibula most probably frac- tured. The astragulus, the os cuneiform internum, and the range of tarsal bones articulated with the os calcis and as- tragidus, are sometimes dislocated simply, but the acci- dent is of very rare occurrence. Dislocations of the phalanges of the toes are similar to those already describ- ed as taking place in the fingers, and do not deserve par- ticular notice. z 2

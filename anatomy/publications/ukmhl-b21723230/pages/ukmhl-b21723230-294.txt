276 callosum is divided transversely, and the anterior partion raised forwards, the laminae of the septum separate, and this cavity becomes distinct; it is larger in the child, but is very irregular in size, and even in existence, in dif- ferent subjects ; the septum lucidum appears to be formed by a lamina descending from each side of the raphe of the corpus callosum to the fornix, some grey matter su- peradded. Divide transversely the septum lucidum and corpus callosum, raise forwards the anterior portion of the latter, and backwards its posterior part; it will now be seen that this substance is united to the fornix poste- riorly, but is nearly an inch above it anteriorly; the sep- tum lucidum is generally so soft that in this stage of the dissection it wifi have nearly broke down into the sur- rounding fluid. The lateral ventricles extend from the middle of the brain into the anterior and posterior lobes, also to the inferior part of the middle lobe, hence they are named tricorne ; the anterior cornu of each passes forwâ€™ards and outwards, and are about an inch distant from each other; the middle portion, or the body of each passes horizon- tally backwards, and are separated from each other by the septum lucidum; near the posterior part of the corpus callosum the posterior and inferior cornua pass off in dif- ferent directions ; the posterior cornu proceeds into the posterior lobe at first outwards, afterwards it turns in- wards in a curved direction, the concavity tow'ards the median line ; the inferior cornu descends obliquely for- wards and outwards, and is then also curved a little in- wards ; it terminates behind the fissure of Sylvius and beneath the anterior cornu. The anterior cornu is bound- ed superiorly and laterally by the corpus callosum, and inferiorly by the large extremity of the corpus striatum ; the middle, or body of each, is bounded superiorly and externally by the corpus callosum ; internally by the sep- tum lucidum, aud inferiorly by the posterior extremity of the corpus striatum, the taenia semicircularis, the optic thalamus, the choroid plexus and the fornix. The posterior cornu is bounded superiorly and laterally by the medullary substance, and inferiorly by the hippocampus minor. The inferior cornu is bounded superiorly by the optic tha-

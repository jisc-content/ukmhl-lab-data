105 great divisions may be arranged into a superficial and deep layer. The pronators and flexors arising from the inner side of the forearm, are eight in number: five in the super- ficial layer, three in the deep ; the five superficial are, the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum sublimis, and flexor carpi ulnaris: the three deep muscles are the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus. In the following description of these muscles, the hand is sup- posed to be turned forwards, the radius externally, and the ulna internally. The muscles, which arise from the internal condyle of the humerus, are covered by the fascia of the biceps ; they cannot be separated from each other above, but have a common origin from the con- dyle, the fascia, and its septa, also from the ulna. Proxator Radii Teres, arises tendinous and fleshy from the anterior part of the internal condyle, from the fascia of the forearm and its intermuscular septa; also by a small tendon from the coronoid process of the ulna; the median nerve separates these origins; the fibres pass obliquely outwards over the radius, and are inserted, chiefly tendinous, into the outer and back part of the radius, about its centre. Use, to pronate the hand, by rolling the radius forwards and inwards over the ulna; it is also a flexor of the forearm ; this is the most exter- nal of the muscles, arising from the inner condyle : it is superficial, except at its insertion, which is covered by the supinator longus, and by the radial vessels, and lies inferior to the supinator brevis: it forms the internal boundary of the triangular hollow at the bend of the elbow, which contains the tendon of the biceps, the bra- chial nerve and vessels. Fle.xor Carpi Radialis, arises narrow and tendi- nous from the inner condyle, and fleshy from the inter- muscular septa; it forms a thick belly, whjch lies very superficial, and ends in a prominent flat tendon ; this de- scends obliquely outwards, passes beneath the annular li- gament, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. Use, to bend the hand, and assist in pronating it; this muscle is overlapped above by the pronator teres, and covered below by the annular li- I 3

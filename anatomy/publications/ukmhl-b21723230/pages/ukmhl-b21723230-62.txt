4)4} the left lobe of the thyroid gland, the recurrent nerve, and the inferior thyroid vessels, lie on it in this situa- tion. The course and connexions of the cesophagus in the chest will be seen hereafter.* SECTION VI. DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. The larynx is composed of several cartilages and muscles: it is placed at the anterior part of the neck, between the tongue and the trachea, and in front of the pharynx and cesophagus, it is suspended by mus- cles and ligaments from the os liyaides; this bone is connected to the chin by several muscles, and to the styloid process of the temporal bone on each side by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscle and ligament: it consists of five parts, the middle portion, or body, is very rough and convex anteriorly for the attachment of muscles, concave posteriorly where it covers the epi- glottidean gland ; from the body the cornua pass oflF, one to either side, giving attachment to muscles above and below, lined by mucous membrane, and serving to ex- * The student should practise the passing of a probe or canula armed with a ligature, along the nares into the pharynx, and endea- vour to enclose the uvula in the noose, thus imitating the operation of tying polypi when situated in the pharynx, on the velum, or in the posterior nares; he may also pass a flexible tube into the pharynx, and thence direct it to the stomach or into the larynx ; any practi- tioner may be suddenly called on to use the stomach pump in case of poison having been swallowed, or to inflate the lungs in asphyxia ; in the first case, when the tube has been passed into the pharynx, from the mouth or nares, the tongue should be pressed back, so as to close the glottis, and the end of the instrument should be kept close to the vertebrre to avoid irritating or pressing on the epiglottis: in the second case, the tube should be passed through either naris into the pharynx, the forceps or the linger of the surgeon introduced into the mouth, can then guide it downwards and forwards to the glottis; at this time, however, the tongue should be drawn for- wards ; thus the epiglottis will be raised and the glottis opened op- posite the edge of the velum ; the tube may then be urged into the larynx, and artificial respiration commenced : in conducting this process it is advisable to press the upper p.art of the trachea gently against the vertebrse, so as to fix the larynx and the tube, as well as to guard against the admission of air into the oesophagus, and the consequent inflation of the stomach.

of a fine mucous membrane, which is continued from the ureter along the pelvis of the kidney, lines all the calyces, and is reflected in the form of a very fine mem- brane over each papilla, and most probably is continued into the tubuli uriniferi. The calyces in each extremity, as also those in the centre, unite into three small tubes, which being of a funnel shape, are called infundibula ; these have but a short course, and soon terminate in the pelvis of the kidney. The pelvis is a membranous reservoir formed by the union of the calyces or the in- fundibula of a flattened oval figure, placed behind the blood-vessels of the kidney, and terminating in the ure- ter, which it resembles in structure. Each kidney re- ceives a very large artery (the renal or eraulgent) from the aorta : this divides into six or eight branches, which enter the notch in the gland, subdivide into numerous fine vessels, which proceed between the tubular por- tions to the cortex, in which they terminate in minute branches, some of which are continuous with corres- ponding veins, others with the commencements of the tubular fasciculi; these last separate the urine from the blood, and pour it into the tubuli uriniferi, which convey it to the papillae, through the small pores of which it gradually flows into the calyces, and from these into the pelvis, and so into the ureter. The ureter is the excre- tory duct of the kidney, and extends from it to the uri- nary bladder ; each ureter is about eighteen inches long, and about the size of a goose quill; its coats are very pale and always appear collapsed. These vessels take an oblique course downwards and inw;ards to the pelvis ; each then inclines a little forwards, continuing still to run downwards and inwards to the inferior and posterior part of the bladder, passes obliquely between the mus- cular and mucous coats of this viscus, and perforates the latter at the posterior angle of the trigone. Each ureter passes anterior to the psoas magnus, and to the iliac^essels, is covered by the peritonaeum, and crossed by llie spermatic vessels, and near its termination in the male subject by the vas deferens ; and in the female by the fallopian tubes, and broad ligaments of the uterus. In the male each ureter attaches itself to the bladder at the posterior extremity of each vcsicula semi-

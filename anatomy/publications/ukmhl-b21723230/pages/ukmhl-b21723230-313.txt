295 broad lamina which is thin in the centre, (the valve of Vieussens,) and thick at each side (processus a cerebel- lo ad testes ;) thus the superior converging fibres con- nect the cerebellum to the quadrigeminal bodies. The inferior converging fibres are more distinct, they pro- ceed from the cineritious substance in either hemisphere, forwards and inwards, and form the principal portion of each crus cerebelli ; they then pass transversely across the pons Varolii and unite with those from the opposite side ; thus the superficial lamina or the transverse fibres of the pons form a commissure betw’een the hemispheres of the cerebellum. STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. Remove the pia mater from the anterior pyramids of the medulla oblongata and separate these from each other, the decussating fibres will be seen, through these the py- ramid on one side may be said to arise from the spinal cord of the opposite side ; as the pyramids approach the pons they are somewhat contracted ; on entering this sub- stance they separate into fasciculi, which intermix with cineritious substance ; they are considerably increased in size and number in passing through the pons, and they then form the anterior and external two-thirds of the crura cerebri. The olivary body and a few fibres from the restiform of each side also ascend through the pons be- hind the fasciculi of the pyramids ; these also increase in size in passing through the pons, and then enter the crura cerebri, the posterior and internal part of which they form. Each crus cerebri contains a mass of cine- ritious substance of a peculiarly dark colour, in passing through which the white fibres appear increased in quan- tity. The posterior and internal fasciculi of each crus ascend and pass into those masses of grey substance called the optic thalami, and the corpora striata; in passing through these their fibres are increased in num- i)€r, and thence extend in a radiated manner into the posterior and superior convolutions of each hemisphere, where they are covered by a layer of grey substance.

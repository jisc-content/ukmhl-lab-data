340 pression between these is the fossa navicularis ; in front of the meatus is an eminence, the tragus, directed back- wards over the meatus ; opposite to tliis is a slight pro- jection, the anti-tragus; within these several eminences is a deep conical cavity, the concha, which leads to the meatus externus, below this, is the pendulous fold of the integuments, or the lobe of the ear ; these several emi- nences are supposed to be of use in protecting the inter- nal parts, also in collecting and directing the sound to- wards the meatus ; in some subjects pale; muscular fibres may be found on these eminences, they have been named according to their situation, as distinct muscles, tragicus, anti-tragicus, major and minor helicis, and transversalis auris; these fibres may have some power in approximat- ing these cartilages, and thus deepening the concha; they are seldom marked in the human subject, but in the lower classes of animals they are strong and distinct. The meatus auditorius externus extends from the concha to the membrana tympani, first forwards, upwards, and in- wards, then downwards and inwards ; it is therefore curved, or concave downwards, about an inch in length, one half cartilaginous, the other osseous ; it is lined by skin, beneath which are a number of ceruminous glands; the cuticle is continued over the membrana tympani, from which it readily separates, and is furnished with a number of fine hairs, which are longer and more obvious externally. The middle ear consists of the tympanum and its appendages. The membrana hjmpani separates this cavity from the meatus externus, the latter must be cut vertically to expose this membrane ; it is placed obliquely, its lower edge being more internal than the upper, or nearer the median line, it therefore looks downwards, outwards, and forwards; it is concave to- wards the meatus, convex towards the tjunpanum, be- ing drawn in the latter direction by its connexion to the handle of the malleus ; it consists of three layers, an external or cuticular, an intei'nal or mucous, and a mid- dle or fibrous, which is dry and elastic. The cavity of the tympanum may be seen either by dividing the mem- brane just described, or, without injuring the latter, the

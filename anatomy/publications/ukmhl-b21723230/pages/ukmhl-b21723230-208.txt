190 Let the student next replace the triangular ligament, &c. and then re-consider the several parts before him, in reference to the operation of lithotomy; he has already examined the triangular space between the erector penis and accelerator urinse muscles, into which the knife of the operator is to sink in order to reach the groove in the staff; this space has been fully opened, and the staff can be plainly felt or seen passing alxrve the bulb through the membranous part of the urethra into the bladder: behind and below the bulb is the rec- tum ; and close to the rami of the pubis and ischium are the internal pudic vessels: the large artery from the pudic, called the deep transverse .artery, or the artery of the bulb, may also be observed passing in the sub- stance of the triangular ligament, about an inch below the symphysis pubis. Hence then, in order to lay bare the staff .without injury to the more important parts which surround it, we should endeavour to open the urethra as near to the base of the triangular ligament as possible, as we shall thus be most likely to avoid the arter)^ of the bulb. When the knife of the operator is lodged in the groove of the staff, and shall then be pushed along it into the bladder, the student will now perceive that the posterior layer of the triangular liga- - ment, the anterior fibres of the levator ani, and the left lateral lobe of the prostate gland, must be divided; and from this view may also learn that the rectum will be protected from injury if the staff be well raised into the arch of the pubes, its groove turned a little to the left side, and the wrist of the operator depressed, so as to elevate the point of the knife, and thus direct it on into the bladder; as to withdrawing the knife the stu- dent may now learn in what direction this can be done with safety and effect, and what parts require to be di- vided ; it is to be withdrawn slowly and steadily in a direction backwards and outwards nearly parallel to the line of the cutaneous incision, the edge so lateralized as to avoid cutting the rectum posteriorly, or the pudic arteiy externally: in this part of the operation the middle fibres of the levator ani must be divided, also - the adipose substance on its perinteal .surface. The student may now withdraw the staffâ€™ from the bladder.

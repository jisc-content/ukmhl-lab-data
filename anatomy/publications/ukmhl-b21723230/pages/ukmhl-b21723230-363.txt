345 Q 3 the eye forwards and inwards, also to rotate it, so as to direct the cornea downwards and inwards towards the tip of the nose. Some authors consider it a rotator out- wards. Obliquus Inferior is situated at the inferior and anterior part of the orbit ; it arises tendinous from the orbital edge of the superior maxillary bone above the infra-orbital foramen, and external to the lachrymal sac ; it ascends obliquely outwards and backwards below the inferior rectus, and is inserted by a tendinous expansion into the sclerotic coat behind the transverse axis of the eye, and between the sclerotic coat and the external rec- tus. Use, to draw the globe forwards and inwards, and to rotate it upwards and outwards. Recti muscles are four in number, the superior is called attollens oculi, the inferior depressor oculi, the internal adductor, and the external abductor oculi; they all arise around the optic foramen ; the external has an additional attachment to the foramen lacerum ; they all pass for- wards around the optic nerve, separated from it by the ciliary vessels and nerves, and by a great quantity of fat; a little beyond the middle of the eye they become ten- dinous, and are each inserted about a quarter of an inch behind the cornea; the four tendons are connected toge- ther by an aponeurosis which is attached to the conjunc- tiva ; the use of these muscles is, collectively, to retract the eye into the orbit, and individually to move it, as their names imply. Under the head of lachrymal apparatus we may con- sider the lachrymal gland, membrana conjunctiva, pal- pebrae, and lachrymal passages. The lachnjmal gland is placed in the upper part of the orbit, behind the external angular process of the os frontis, above the external rectus and the conjunctiva ; of a flattened oval figure, and a pale colour, separable into two or more lobes, which, like other conglomerate glands, can be .separated into numerous granules ; these are united by a loose capsule ; from these, five or six small ducts pro- ceed and open behind the upper eyelid along the line of reflection of the conjunctiva from the palpebra to the sclerotic.

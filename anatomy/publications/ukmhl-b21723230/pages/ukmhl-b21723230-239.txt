221 passes behind the condyle of the femur: it then turns forwards and outwards towards the inner side of the upper end of the tibia, into which it is inserted below the tubercle, by a long flat tendon, the anterior edge of which is attached to the fascia lata, covering the knee joint, and the posterior edge sends off an aponeurosis to tlie fascia of the leg. Use, to flex the leg upon the thigh, also the latter on the pelvis ; to adduct the thigh and leg obliquely, so as to cross the lower extremities ; when the thigh and leg are extended, it assists in rais- ing and advancing forwards the whole limb, also in turning the knee outwards : wdien the knee is bent, it may turn the leg and toes inwards; in standing, it also supports the pelvis and prevents it bending backwards on the thigh. This muscle, through its whole extent, is co^'ered only by the fascia lata and the integuments ; its superior extremity lies between the tensor vaginre and the iliacus intemus muscles ; its inferior extremity* expands into a strong aponeurosis, which covers and adheres to the tendons of the semi-tendinosiis and gra- cilis muscles ; in its course along the thigh it first passes over the psoas, iliacus, and rectus muscles, next over the abductor muscles and the femoral vessels, from which it is separated by a strong aponeurosis; infe- riorly it passes over the internal lateral ligament of the knee, between the tendons of the adductor magnus and the gracilis. The superior third of this muscle extends in an oblique direction from the ilium downwards and inwards, forms the external boundary of the inguinal region, and lies to the outer side of the femoral vessels; the middle third is more vertical in its course, and is here about two inches broad, and' completely covers the femoral vessels, also a part of the adductor and vastus intemus muscles. Rectus Femoris, long and flat, rather round in the centre, placed vertically on the fore-part of the thigh, arises by two tendons, one short, strong, anterior and internal, from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, the other longer, broader, and more curved from the superior and external border of the acetabu- lum, and from the capsular ligament; these tendons

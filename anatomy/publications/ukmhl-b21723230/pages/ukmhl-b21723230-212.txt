194> and are four in number, two anterior and two lateral. Wc shall first consider the false liyaments, or the folds of the peritongeum, which serve to connect the bladder to the pelvic viscera. The posterior ligaments of the bladder are two in number, one on each side; they lead from the fore-part of the rectum to the back part of the bladder ; each is of a semilunar form, its concavity looking forwards and upwards ; in this fold are con- tained the ureter posteriorly, and the obliterated hy- pogastric artery anteriorly ; between the posterior liga- ments the cul de sac of the peritonaeum descends. This membrane will be also found thrown into one or two semilunar folds on the posterior surface of the bladder, provided this viscus be in a state of contraction; these disappear, however, when it becomes distended : hence it may be inferred, that these folds are designed to admit of the more easy distention of this organ. The lateral ligaments extend, one on each side, from the la- teral regions of the bladder to the iliac fossae; each contains in its duplicature the vas deferens in the male subject, and the ligamentum teres of the uterus in the female. The superior ligament extends from the sum- mit of the bladder to the recti muscles ; this portion of the peritonaeum is partially reflected over the remains of the urachus and of the hypogastric vessels. Detach the peritonaeum from the right iliac fossa, and gently draw the bladder and rectum from the pelvis, w^e shall then observe, that the neck and side of the former are retained in their situation by the reflection of a strong fascia (the pelvic fascia) from the parietes of the pelvis upon this viscus ; these reflections are the true liga- ments of the bladder. The pelvic faseia may be con- sidered as a continuation of the iliac fascia ; it de- scejids from behind the iliac vessels and from the brim of the pelvis, to which it adheres, and lines the pari- etes of the cavity as low down as the upper edge, or the origin of the levator ani muscle ; here the pelvic fascia divides into two laminae, between which this mus- cle is enclosed ; the external lamina is named the ob- turator fascia, the internal the vesical fascia. The ob- turator fascia descends between the obturator internus and levator ani muscles, adhering very closely to the

78 the left. On the left side of this tube, the thoracic duct is seen ascending from the thorax into the heck, between the left carotid and subclavian arteries. As the oeso- phagus enters the chest, we observe on either side of it the recurrent nerve ; that of the left side passes out of this cavity, that of the right arises on a level with this opening: external to this nerve, on each side, we perceive the sympathetic entering the chest; it lies posterior to the phrenic and the vagus, but between both; this nerve having formed its inferior cervical ganglion, divides into several branches which descend into the thorax, a few pass anterior to the subclavian artery, the principal pass behind it; they all unite in its first thoracic ganglion, which is situated on the neck of the first rib ; the sympathetic then descends along the side of the spine, passing over the heads of the ribs, and opposite each intercostal space forms a small trian- gular ganglion, from each of which two or three small branches proceed to join the dorsal spinal nervâ€™es, and from the five or six inferior the great and small splanch- nic nerves arise ; the sympathetic is so small, inferiorly, that it is often difficult to trace it, it escapes from the thorax into the abdomen, beneath the true ligamentum arcuatum. Posterior to the oesophagus, the longi colli muscles ascend through the upper opening of the tho- rax ; on each side of these lie the superior intercostal artery, and the anterior branch of the 1st dorsal nerve, ascending to join the last cervdcal in the brachial plexus.

Place the subject on the forepart, raise the chest by blocks, let the head and arms hang, thus, the muscles in this region will be made tense: divide the integu-

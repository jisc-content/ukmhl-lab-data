to the thymus gland. The use of this organ is not fully ascertained. Next dissect the muscles at the upper part of the neck. Digastric us, placed at the lateral and interior part of the neck, thick and fleshy at each extremity, ^round and tendinous in the centre, arises from a groove in the temporal bone, internal to the mastoid process, descends obliquely forwards and inwards, ends in a round ten- don which perforates the stylo-hyoid muscle, and i.s connected to the cornu of the os hyoides by a dense fascia, sometimes by a tendinous ring like a pully : the tendon is then reflected upwards and forwards, and soon ends in the anterior fleshy belly, which continu- ing forwards and inwards, is inserted into a rough de- pression on the inner side of the base of the jaw, close to the symphysis. ?7se, to depress the lower jaw, and when the mouth is closed, to elevate the os hyoides, tongue and larynx ; the posterior belly can also draw these backwards and upw'ards, and the anterior up- w'ards and forwards, so that this muscle can exert great nfluence in deglutition; it can also draw' the head backwards, if the chin be fixed. The digastric is covered posteriorly by the sterno-mastoid and splenius, and by a portion of the parotid, more anteriorly by a few' fibres of the stylo-hyoideiis and a small part of the .submaxillary gland, by the ceirical fascia, platysma and .skin: it passes across the styloid muscles, the external and internal carotid arteries, the 8th, 9th and sympa- thetic nerves; also the origin of the hyo-glossus and insertion of the mylo-hyoid. In the position in which the subject is placed during this dissection, this muscle forms the inferior or convex border of a semicircular .space, the superior straight edge of whiph is marked by the side of the maxilla, and by a line continued from its angle to the mastoid process; this digastric- space is divided by the stylo-maxillary ligament into a posterior and anterior part. The posterior smaller one contains the parotid gland, the carotid artery, and 7th pair of neives ; and deeper than these, the styloid process and origin of the styloid muscles, also the internal-caro- tid, jugular vein, and 8th, 9th, and sympathetic nen-es. The anterior division of the digastric space contains

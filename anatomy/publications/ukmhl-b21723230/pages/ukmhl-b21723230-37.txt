19 partially so; in the middle line of the neck a chain of projections may be observed, which can also be felt during life, viz. a little below, but at some distance be- hind the chin, is the body of the os hyoides; inferior to this is the angle of the thyroid cartilage; next is the cricoid, below which the commencement of the trachea may be felt, on the fore part of which the soft swelling of the thyroid gland can be discerned; and lastly, the continuation of the trachea descending into the chest. Platysma-jiyoides, or latissimus colli, is a thin cutaneous muscle, in many subjects weak, and even indistinct; its figure is somewhat square, being a little longer than it is broad; it arises by many fine fleshy fibres from the cellular membrane, covering the upper part of the deltoid and pectoral muscles ; a few also ad- here to the clavicle; the fibres ascend obliquely in- wards, at first loosely, afterwards closely connected to each other, and form a broad thin muscle, covering the side of the neck, inserted, 1st, into the chin, de- cussating there with fibres from the opposite side: 2d, into the fascia along the side of the lower jaw, a few only into the bone; some fibres may be traced high on the face, and seen to join the depressor anguli oris, the zygomatic and orbicularis palpebrarum muscles; and 3d, into the fascia, which covers the parotid, and which adheres to the meatus auditorius. Use, to depress the angle of the lips and the lower jaw, but if the mouth be closed it may elevate the integuments of the neck; it also serves to compre.ss and support the several muscles, glands, and vessels in this region. The pla- tysma is covered only by the skin : it partly conceals the clavicle, the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, and thyroid mus- cles ; also the digastric and stylo-hyoid, the sub-maxil- lary gland,, and lower part of the parotid ; also, in part, the external jugular vein: this vein commences in the parotid gland, descends obliquely outwards over the stemo-mastoid muscle, where it lies very superficial, and then sinks behind the clavicle, and joins the sub- clavian vein or some of its branches. The upper por- tion of the external jugular vein is accompanied by a large nerve, superjicialis colli, a branch of the cervical

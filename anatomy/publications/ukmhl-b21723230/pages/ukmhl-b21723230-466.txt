44-8 lar plate, at the lower and outer angle of which is, 3rd, the pterygoid process ; and 4th, at the upper extremity of the nasal is the orbital portion ; the palate process or plate is nearly square, flat, and rough below', smooth above, and concave from side to side to form part of the floor of the nose, posteriorly it has a thin edge to which the velum palati is attached ; its anterior border is ser- rated to join the palate plate of the maxillary bone, its in- ner edge rises into a spine or crest to support the vomer, and is continued posteriorly into the posterior nasal spine ; its centre is thinner than its edges. The nasal process or vertical plate is broad and thin, rests partly on the maxillary bone, its inner or nasal surface forms part of the nasal fossa, and is marked by two depressions which assist in forming the low'er and middle meatus of the nose, the ridge between these supports the lower spongy bone, externally it is uneven and grooved for the poste- rior palatine vessels and nerves; the anterior edge of this plate is thin and brittle, and prolonged for some way over the antrum, the posterior edge joins the pterygoid pro- cesses. The tuberosity or the pterygoid process arises from the lower and outer angle, is thick and wedge-shaped, it inclines backwards and outw'ards, and presents three fos- sae, one at each side for each pterj'goid plate, and one in the middle w'hich assists in forming the pterygoid fossa; the innermost of these fossae is the deepest: this process is perforated by one or two small holes which lead from the palatine canal : at the upper extremity of the nasal plate are the orbital and sphenoidal processes, separated from each other by a deep notch ; the orbital is the larger and anterior of the two, it is triangular and bent a little outwards, it appears in the most remote part of the floor of the orbit, where it is joined to the maxil- lary bone by one edge, to the os planum by the second, while the third enters into the spheno maxillary fissure; the sphenoidal or posterior orbital process is smaller, and is articulated to the body and spongy plate of the sphenoid bone ; both these processes are cellular, the cells communicate with those of the aethmoid and sphe- noid bones ; the notch betw'een these two processes forms the spheno palatine hole ; the palate bone is

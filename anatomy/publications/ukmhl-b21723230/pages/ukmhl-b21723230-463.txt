445 The Malar or Cheek Bone is placed at the outer, and under part of the orbit, and forms the prominence of the cheek ; it is of an irregular square form, convex externally, and covered by the skin and orbicularis palpebrarum ; it presents one or two small holes for vessels and nerves ; its upper and outer edge is named external orbitar process, and joins the frontal bone ; its inner end is cut off oblique- ly and serrated, is attached to and overlaps the maxillary bone, this is the maxillarrj process ; the upper edge is round, smooth, and concave, forms jifert of the base of the orbit and ends internally in a long angle, named the in- ternal orbital process ; the lower is thick and uneven, and gives attachment to the masseter muscle, it ends pos- teriorly in the zygomatic process, w’hich passes back- wards, and terminates in a serrated edge which supports the zj'gomatic process of the temporal hone ; behind this the malar bone is smooth, and forms part of the temporal fossa; from the posterior surface a thin plate extends into the orbit, and is named the internal orbital process; the posterior edge of this is notched to close the spheno- maxillar}’ fissure anteriorly. The malar bone is thick, strong, and cellular ; it is well developed in the foetus. It is joined to four bones, the frontal, sphenoid, temporal, and superior maxillarj'; the processes are five, the supe- rior, inferior, and internal orbital, the malar, and z}'go- matic ; the foramina are two or three proper and one common. The Superior Maxillary Bone is of a very irregailar figure and attached to all the bones of the face ; it forms part of the front of the face, a portion of the orbit, nose, and palate ; it may be divided into the body and pro- cesses. The bochj is concave anteriorly, to form the infra-orbital or canine fossa, in the upper part of which is the infra-orbital hole ; it is bounded externally and above by a rough serrated surface, the malar process, which is smooth and hollowed out behind for the temporal muscle ; .springing from the inner and upper part of the hotly, is the nasal process of a pyramidal form, perfo- rated by one or two small holes for vessels, serrated above to join the os frontis, prominent below, slightly grooved anteriorly to receive the nasal bone and the alar cartilage, and deeply grooved behind to form jrart of the lachrymal

terior extremity is slightly convex, smooth above and covered by a bursa, and rough below for the insertion of the tendon achillis ; the anterior extremity is smaller, and presents an articular surface for the cuboid bone, which is concave from above downwards and convex -from side to side ; externally it is rather flat, being marked w-ith two shallow grooves, for the peronaeal ten- dons, a spine separates these, into this the external lateral ligament of the ankle joint is inserted, internally it is broad and hollowed out into an arch, under which the flexor tendons, the tibialis posticus, and the plantar ves- sels and nerves pass, the tendon of the flexor pollicis runs in a distinct groove; the os calcis is attached above to the astragalus and before to the cuboid. The Navicular or Scaphoid Bone is situated about the middle of the tarsus and at its upper and internal part; of an oval form, its posterior surface is smooth and concave, to form a sort of superficial or glenoid cavity for the head of the astragalus, the latter however is much larger and projects inferiorly, in which direction it is supported by the strong calceo-scaphoid ligament, and by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which here generally contains a sesamoid bone; the anterior surface is convex, and divided by two vertical ridges into three surfaces for the three cuneiform bones; the circumfer- ence is irregular for the attachment of ligaments, inter- nally it is rather smooth, but inferiorly it presents a tu- bercle into which the tibialis posticus is inserted ; on its external side there is in general a small flat articular surface for the cuboid bone ; the scaphoid is connected to the astragalus, to the three cuneiform and to the cu- boid bones. The Cuboid Bone is situated at the outer and anterior part of the tarsus external to the navicular, and anterior to the calcaneum ; although of a cubical form, it is yet thicker and longer internally than externally, its upper surface is flat and rough for the attachment of ligaments and muscles, the lower surface is irregular, rough and tubercular behind for the calceo-cuboid ligametit, and grooved before for the tendon of the peronaeus longus, its posterior surface is smooth, concave transversely, and convex from above downwards: it articulates with

389 contents partly into the right ventricle, but principally through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. From the right ventricle the blood is propelled into the pulmo- nary artery ; this vessel in the foetus divides into three branches, one for either lung small, and one in the cen- tre very large, the ductus arteriosus, this is about half iUi inch in length, passes backwards and downwards, and joins the aorta a little below its arch; but little blood passes through the lateral branches, the principal portion passing through the ductus arteriosus into the aorta. That portion of blood which was transmitted directly from the right auricle, through the foramen ovale into the left auricle, descends into the left ventricle, from which it is also propelled into the aorta, the superior branches of w'hich circulate the blood through the uppe' parts of the body, whence it is returned to the heart b} the veins that form the superior vena cava. The de- scending aorta conveys the blood to the abdominal vis- cera, and at the fourth lumbar vertebra this vessel divides into the external and internal iliac arteries, the former is small in the child, the latter is very large, and is named the umbilical or hj-pogastric artery, this passes fonvards and upwards along the side of the bladder, approaches its fellow, and ascends to the umbilicus ; these arteries then twine around the umbilical vein in the cord, and arriving at the placenta divide into numerous branches, which ramify through this organ; these two arteries thus serve the office of veins. The external iliac arteries descend as in the adult, and the blood which they circulate is re- turned by the corresponding veins. The iliac veins unite at the fourth lumbar vertebra, and commence the inferior vena cava, which ascends, and, as in the adult, passes through the liver, is joined by the hepatic veins, and then terminates in the right auricle of the heart. In connexion with the foetal heart, the student may remark the thymus gland; this body fills the upper part of the anterior mediastinum, ascending as high as the thyroid gland, and descending in front of the pericardium, and the great vessels, nearly as low as the diaphragm ; it consists of two lobes of an oval figure, close in the centre, but separated at either end. It lies on the trachea, the

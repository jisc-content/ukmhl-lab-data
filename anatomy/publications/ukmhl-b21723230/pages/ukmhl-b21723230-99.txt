81 wards and to one side. This muscle is covered by the skin only, its origin in many points is continuous with that of its fellow ; it covers the splenii, complex!, serra- tus superior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles ; its anterior fibres are parallel to the sterno-mastoid, in con- Uict with it above, but separated below by fat, vessels and nerves; in some subjects a band of fleshy fibres unites these muscles above the clavicle. L.vtissimus Dorsi is very broad, and also triangu- lar ; it covers the greater part of the lumbar and dorsal regions, and extends from these to the inner side of the arm ; arises from the six inferior dorsal spines, and by the lumbar fascia from all the lumbar spines, also from the back of the sacrum, from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, and by distinct fleshy slips from the three or four last ribs near their anterior extremity ; the iliac and lumbar fibres ascend obliquely outwards; the dorsal, which are much wâ€™eaker, pass transversely; and the costal are nearly vertical; all converge towards the inferior angle of the scapula, over which they glide, and from which they often derive an additional fasci- culus of fleshy fibres ; thence the muscle continues to ascend obliquely outwards over the teres major, and near the inside of the arm it twists beneath this muscle to its fore part, ends in aflat broad tendon, which is closely connected to that of the teres, and is inserted into the inner or posterior edge of the bicipital groove, anterior and superior to that tendon; a small bursa is usually found between these tendons in this situation. Use, to depress the shoulder and arm, to draw the arm back- wards and inwards, to rotate the humerus inwards so as to turn the palm of the hand backwards, also to depress the ribs as in expiration; but if the upper extremity be raised and fixed, this muscle may elevate the ribs, and so assist in inspiration, as well as in raising the whole body, 33 in climbing. The dorsal portion of the latissimus dorsi is covered by the trapezius; the remainder of this muscle is su- perficial, its origin is superior to the glutaeus maximus, its anterior edge is connected to the abdominal mus- cles, the inferior fasciculi of the external oblique indi- gitate with its costal origins; it covers the serratus in-

171 glions. At the last lumbar vertebra these nerves pass outwards and backwards, and then descend into the pelvis. The commencement of the vena azygos may be ob- sen'ed on the I'ight side of the aorta ; it is formed by the first or second lumbar veins which communicate with the renal and inferior lumbar veins, and sometimes with the inferior vena cava. The vena azygos enters the thorax between the aorta and tlie right crus of the diaphragm, and then ascends along the posterior medias- tinum. The thoracic duct also may he seen to com- mence in the abdomen by the union of several absorbent vessels on the body of the third lumbar vertebra ; this vessel, being larger here than it is above, has received the name of receptaculum chyli; this, however, does not alw'ays exist. The thoracic duct is covered at first by the aorta, it then ascends obliquely to the right side, and entei-s the thorax betw’een the aorta and vena azy- gos. Let the student next examine the urinary organs ; these consist—1st, of the kidneys, which secrete the urine ; 2d, of the ureters, which convey this fluid to 3d, the urinary bladder, w'hicb retains it for a longer or shorter time ; and 4th, the urethra, which discharges it externally. DISSECTION OF THE KIDNEYS AND URETERS. Each kidney is situated in the posterior part of each lumbar region, behind the peritonaeum, between the last rib and the crest of the ilium ; and corresponds to the two last dorsal and two first lumbar vertebrae; the right kidney is often a little low'er than the left, particularly if the liver be larger than usual; they are each imbedded in a quantity of soft adipose substance, and lie on the diaphragm, psoas, and quadratus lumborum muscles; the ascending colon and duodenum lie anterior to the right, and the descending colon to the left kidney ; the right is in contact with the liver above, and with the emeum below ; and the left with the spleen above, and the sigmoid flexure of the colon below.

34<8 The Lachrymal sac is a small oval pouch of mucous membrane, closed above and leading below into the nasal duct, it is situated in a fossa formed by the max- illary and unguis bones, covered by the integuments, the tendon and some fleshy fibres of the orbicularis muscle, also by a strong fascia which is derived from that tendon and connected to the surrounding bony mai^in. A small muscle has been described by Mr. Horner as arising from the edge of the os unguis, and inserted into the lachrymal sac and ducts ; he conceives it to have the power of compressing the sac, and direct- ing the ducts and their contents towards it ; it is not, however, in all subjects to be distinguished from the or- bicular, which last can effect the purpose ascribed to this small muscle. The Nasal Duct (about three-fourths of an inch in length in the recent state) descends from the sac obliquely backwards and a little outwards, surrounded by the max- illary, unguis, and inferior spongy bones ; beneath the latter it opens by a small slit-like orifice, which is sur- rounded by a circular fold of mucous membrane, into the lower meatus, about an inch from the anterior part of the naris ; this duct is formed of mucous membrane only, it is connected to the periosteum. The nerves and vessels of the orbit have been already examined. The nerves of the palpebrae are derived from the portio dura of the seventh, from the lachrymal, frontal, and nasal branches of the ophthalmic, and from the infra-orbital branches of the fifth pair of nerves ; the vessels are branches of the ophthalmic, temporal, and facial. DISSECTION OF THE GLOBE OF THE EYE. It will facilitate the student in learning the anatomy of the eye, to dissect this organ in some of the inferior animals ; almost every part of importance may be exa- mined with equal advantage in the eye of the sheep, ox, or pig, as in that of the human subject; many of the minute parts are even on a larger scale, and can be dissected with gveater ease : w'e also have it in our

197 and in either sex occasionally to the convolutions of the small intestines ; all this region is covered by peritonfeum. fith, The inferior region, in the female, lies on the ure- ters and on the vagina ; in the male, on the vesiculae se- minales, the intervening cul de sac of peritonseum, the rectum and the prostate gland ; the superior and posterior part of this region is covered by the peritonaeum ; but an- terior to the line of the reflection of this membrane, f)-ora the bladder to the rectum, is the triangular portion of this ^region, in which the peritonaeum is deficient, and Avhich has been already attended to, as the situation in which the operation of tapping the bladder from the rectum may be performed. The coats of the bladder are four, viz., 1st, the serous, or peritonaeal ; 2d, the muscular ; 3d, the cellular ; 4th, the mucous : the serous is but a partial coat, it covers all the posterior surface, the posterior part of the upper and lower fundus ; also the posterior part of each side. All the anterior region, the fore-part of the sides, and of the upper and lower regions, are therefore uncovered by peritonaeum ; when the bladder is dis- tended there is more of this organ in proportion co- vered by this membrane than in its contracted state. The peritonaeal covering of the bladder is very dense, it may be easily dissected off the following. 2d, the ■muscular coat consists of fibres which are stronger and redder' than the muscular fibres on any of the other hollow viscera ; they take different directions ; those of the superficial layer run chiefly in a longitudinal direc- tion, are connected anteriorly and inferiorly to the an- terior ligaments of the bladder, and superiorly to the urachus, posteriorly and inferiorly to the base of the prostate gland ; these fibres are stronger on the ante- rior and posterior surfaces than on the sides of the blad- der : on the latter regions they run obliquely. The an- terior fibres, from having a fi.xed attachment, are called by some the detrusor urince muscle ; the deep fibres mostly take a circular direction, are w’eak superiorly, but strong near the cer\dx, where they are supposed to act as a sphincter muscle; these circular fibres which have received this name, may be more distinctly seen

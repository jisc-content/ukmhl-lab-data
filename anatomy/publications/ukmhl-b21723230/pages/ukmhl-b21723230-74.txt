56 lies on a plane anterior to the next or middle division^ which is very thin, consisting of but few fleshy fibres, connected together by an aponeurosis. This portion is of a triangular form, the apex attached to the 3d and 4th ribs, the base to the basis of the scapula, not ex- actly to the bone, hut to a strong tendinous cord, which extends along this line from the superior to the inferior angle. The third, or inferior division of the serratus is the strongest and most extensive; it is ra- diated or triangular: the apex thick and fleshy, at- tached to the inferior angle of the scapula; the base thin and expanded on the ribs. The serratus may be again examined when dissecting the muscles on the back of the trunk. Intercostales, are 22 in number on each side, 11 external and 11 internal:â€”the external commence at the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, arise from the inferior edge of each rib, descend in fasciculi obliquely forwards, and are inserted into the external lip of the superior edge of the rib beneath, and termi- nate a little behind the costal extremity of the carti- lages : an aponeurosis, the fibres of w'hich run in the same direction, supply their place as far as the ster- num. The internal intercostal muscles take an oppo- site direction, and decussate the former; they com- mence at the sternum, and are discontinued at the an- gles of the ribs; they arise from the inner lip of the lower edge of each cartilage and rib, the fibres, paler and shorter than those of the external, descend ob- liquely backwards, and are inserted into the inner lip of the superior edge of the cartilage and rib beneath. Use, both laminae co-operate to raise the ribs, the first rib being fixed by the scaleni. The intercostal mus- cles, in elevating the ribs, also evert their lower edges, and twist them at their vertebral and sternal ends, and thus assist in inspiration, by enlarging the chest trans- versely, and from before backwards. The internal layer lies on the pleura, and is separated from the external by the intercostal vessels and nerves: the external layer is connected to the pleura only in the space be- tween the angles of the ribs and the vertebrae. At the posterior extremity of the external intercostal muscles

154 bar and in the umbilical regions; it takes a semicircular course around the head of the pancreas: this course may be divided into three parts : the 1st, or superior trans- verse ; the 2d, or peiâ€™pendicular, and the 3d, or inferior transverse. The superior transverse portion ascends from the pylorus obliquely backwards and to the right side, beneath the edge of the liver, so as to touch the ^1 bladder; here the intestine makes a sudden turn, the superior angle, and the middle or perpendicular portion of it commences ; this descends in front of the right kid- ney, as low as the third lumbar vertebra, where it makes a second turn (the inferior angle) from which the inferior transverse portion extends obliquely upwards, and to the left side, and at the first lumbar vertebra ends in the jejunum. The duodenum differs from the remainder of the small intestine, in being fixed in its situation, and be- ing only partially covered by the peritonaeum, and being of much larger caliber, particularly near the inferior an- gle : its muscular coat is very strong, and the valvulae con- niventes very numerous. The superior transverse portion is more contracted than any other part of it; it is covered on both surfaces by peritonaeum like the stomach, and is, therefore, more moveable than the rest of the intestine. The perpendicular portion is concealed by the omentum, and by the colon, and is covered by the ascending layer of the meso-colon ; this portion lies on the right kidney, and on the vena cava, and has no peritonaeum posterior to it; it is therefore fixed, and is dilatable; the biliaiy and pancreatic ducts perforate the inner side of this division of the duodenum : these pass through its coats very obliquely, and open into the intestine, sometimes distinctly, and at other times conjointly, on a small papilla, opposite the inferior angle. The inferior trans- verse part of the duodenum passes across the aorta and the right renal vessels ; like the middle portion, it is only partially covered by the peritonaeum, being placed between the layers of the meso-colon ; its lower border may be seen without dissection, projecting through the inferior layer of the meso-colon ; the superior mesenteric vessels pass in front of the termination of this part of the duodenum, and appear to compress it against the aorta, BO as to retard the passage of its contents into the jeju-

17S laughing, speaking; also in the expulsion of urine and faeces, and in the various exertions of the body. The student may now re-consider the different muscles which assist, and which oppose the diaphragm in respiration; â€¢by this term we mean the act of taking into the lungs a certain quantity of air, and the subsequent expulsion of it from these organs ; the former is termed inspiration, the latter expiration. Inspiration requires greater mus- cular efforts than expiration, which is chiefly effected by the relaxation of the muscles of inspiration, and by the elasticity of the parietes of the thorax. Inspiration may be performed with two different degrees of force ; the first, in which there is little muscular effort, is called or- dinary inspiration; the second in which there is great exertion, is called full inspiration. In the first, the dia- phragm and the intercostal muscles are employed, but chiefly the former; and in the second, several additional muscles assist, viz. the scaleni, the subclavian, the serrati postici; also by fixing the superior extremities, the pec- toral, serrati magni and latissimi dorsi muscles exert con- siderable power in elevating the ribs and drawing them outwards, so as to enlarge the chest transversely, and from before backwards. Expiration also may be performed in the same different degrees of intensity ; in the first or ordinary degree, the elasticity and slight contraction of the abdominal muscles press the viscera against the diaphragm, which is already receding in consequence of its own relaxation, and the elasticity of the parts attached to its thoracic surface: when expiration is performed in the second, or forced degree, the elasticity of the ribs and of their cartilages opposes the intercostal muscles ; the triangulares sterni also depress the cartilages, and the abdominal muscles and levatores ani, by increasing their contracting force, push the abdominal viscera against the diaphragm, and draw down the ribs ; the serrati postici inferiores and quadrati lumborum muscles assist, also the latissimi dorsi muscles, by acting towards the ilium; and should the last rib be fixed, it is possible for the intercostal muscles to depress the superior ribs, and so to become muscles of expiration.

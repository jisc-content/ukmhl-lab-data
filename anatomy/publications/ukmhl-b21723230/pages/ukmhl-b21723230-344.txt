32G The Sacual Nerves are five pair, they divide with- in the spinal canal into their anterior and posterior branches, the latter, very small, pass through the poste- rior sacral holes and supply the muscles and integuments; the anterior branches are very large, particularly the three superior, the two last are much smaller ; these five nerves, with the branch from the last lumbar, form the sacral plexus, large and flat, placed on the sacrum and pyramidal muscle behind the rectum, and the other pel- vic viscera, it sends off the following branches both in- ternal and external; the internal or pelvic are the hae- morrhoidal and vesical, and in the female the uterine and the vaginal; the external branches are the inferior glu- taeal, the inferior or lesser sciatic, posterior cutaneous, pudic, and great sciatic or posterior crural. The hce- morrhoidal, vesical, uterine and vaginal branches are all small nerves which arise from the upper part of the plexus, are entangled with accompanying vessels, and interlace wdth each other ; they are distributed to the different pelvic viscera, as their names imply. The les- ser sciatic nerve escapes from the pelvis w'ith the former and with the sciatic artery, it then passes downwards to the space between the tuber ischii and trochanter major, but nearer to the former, round which it twines, and at its lower part divides into two sets of branches, a super- ficial and a deep ; the former pass over the hamstring muscles with the posterior cutaneous nerve, and are lost in these muscles ; and the latter pass under the muscles and are distributed to the quadratus femoris, upper part of the adductor magnus muscles, &c. and some go to the hip joint. The inferior glutceal nerve leaves the pelvis below the pyriform muscle, and divides at once into seve- ral branches, which are principally distributed to the glutseus maximus, some also pass to the perinaeum and to the inner side of the thigh. The posterior cutaneous nerve arises in common with the preceding from the se- cond and third sacral nerves, escapes from the pehds below the pyriform muscle, becomes cutaneous, and descends along the back part of the thigh and leg, and communicates with the cutaneous nerves in the latter region. The pudic nerve arises from the third and

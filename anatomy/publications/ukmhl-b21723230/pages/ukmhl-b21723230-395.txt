377 liibia, and to the corpus cavernosum and dorsum of the clitoris, analogous to, but smaller than those in the male. The external iliac artery proceeds from the common iliac downwards and outwards to Poupart’s ligament, beneath which it passes and receives the name of femoral; it lies along the inner side of the psoas, the vein is inter- nal and posterior to it, it gives off near the groin two branches ; 1st, circumfiexa ilii arises from its outer side, ascends obliquely outwards as far as the crest of the ilium, where it divides into several branches, some pass to the abdominal muscles, others to the iliacus internus and qua- drates lumborum, and communicate with the ilio-lumbar arterj" ; 2nd, the epigastric artery arises from its fore- part, a little above Poupart’s ligament, it at first descends, then turns forw’ards and ascends between the abdominal muscles and the peritonaeum, crosses behind the sperma- tic cord, a little internal to the internal inguinal ring ; about three or four inches above the pubis it enters the sheath of the rectus, divides into branches which ascend in this muscle to the umbilicus, and inosculate with the mammary artery. The femoral artery, or the continuation of the ex- ternal iliac, descends obliquely inwards from the middle of the crural arch, along the anterior and internal part of the thigh, covered superiorly by the skin, superficial fascia, inguinal glands and fascia lata ; in the middle of the thigh it is also covered by the sartorius, and be- neath this by a strong aponeurosis connecting the vastus internus to the tendons of the adductor longus and magnus, at the inferior part of the middle third of the thigh, it passes obliquely backwards through a tendi- nous opening, bounded externally by the vastus inter- nus, internally by the adductor magnus, superiorly by the adductors magnus and longus, and inferiorly by the adductor magnus and vastus internus ; the femoral artery first passes over the psoas and iliacus, next over the pectinseus and short adductor, from which it is se- parated by a quantity of cellular membrane and by small vessels, it ne.\t passes over the tendon of the ad- ductor longus ; the femoral vein descends along with it,

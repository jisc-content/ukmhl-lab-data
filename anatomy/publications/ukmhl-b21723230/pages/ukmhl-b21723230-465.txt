447 anterior sethmoid cells, and opening into the middle mea- tus ; the body of this bone is bounded below by a strong horizontal plate, the palatine process, the upper surface of which is smooth and concave, and forms the floor of the nose, the lower is rough, and forms the roof of the mouth ; it is thick before, thin and serrated behind to join the palate bone, internally it is thick and rough, and joins the opposite bone, by a suture, in the anterior part of which is the anterior palatine canal, which opens inferiorly on the palate by the foramen incisivum, and superiorly by two^distinct holes, one in each nostril; this internal edge is raised so as to form the nasal spine or crest to receive the vomer, anteriorly this projects so as to form the ante- rior nasal spine, to which the cartilaginous septum of the nose is attached; between this and the nasal process the bone is very concave and forms the anterior opening of the nares. The palate plate is bounded anteriorly and externally by the curved alveolar edge or process ; this is very thick particularly behind, and is divided into se- veral, generally eight, conical cavities for the teeth ; the partitions between these are formed of dense cellular tex- ture which is less compact posteriorly. The superior maxillary bone is connected to two bones of the cranium, the frontal and aethmoid, and to seven bones of the face, the nasal, lachrymal, malar, palate, inferior, spongy, vo- mer, and to its fellow of the opposite side, also to the teeth ; it is sometimes connected to the pterygoid pro- cesses of the sphenoid. Tlte processes are eight, the nasal, orbital, malar, tuberosity, alveolar, palatine, nasal crest, and nasal spine; the foramina are three proper and four common ; the proper are the infra-orbital, the fora- men antri, and foramen incisivum ; the common are the spheno-max illary fissure, the posterior palatine hole or canal, the anterior nares, and the nasal or lachrymal duct; this bone is well developed in the foetus with the excep- tion of the alveoli and sinus, which do not appear for a few years. The Palate Bone is situated at the outer and back part of the nose, between the pterygoid processes and the superior maxillary bone, it is of a very irregular figure and may be divided into four parts ; 1st, the ho- rizontal or palate plate, 2nd the nasal or perpendicu-

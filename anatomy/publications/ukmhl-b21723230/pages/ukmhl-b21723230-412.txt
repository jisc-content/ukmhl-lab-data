The bodies of the vertebrae are united by an anterior, a posterior, and inter-vertebral ligaments. The Anterior Vertebral Ligament is a strong band of fibres extending from the axis to the sacrum, and adher- ing to the bones and inter-vertebral substances: beneath this band other fibres are seen crossing obliquely between the bodies of the vertebrae. This ligament is narrow in the cervical and lumbar regions, broader and more dis- tinct in the dorsal ; it consists of three planes of fibres, viz, the superficial extend over four or five vertebrae; the middle over two or three, and the third only cover a sin- gle vertebra. The Posterior Vertebral Ligament extends down the back part of the bodies of the vertebrae, along the front of the spinal canal; it consists of smooth glistening fibres; it is narrow in the dorsal, and broad in the lumbar and cervical regions. The Inter-vertebral Ligaments or fibro-cartilages are placed between the bodies of all the vertebrae, except between the atlas and dentata. They are united very firmly above and below to the flat surfaces of the verte- brae. In the neck and loins they are thicker in front than behind, the contrary in the back ; they are formed of con- centric layers of fibrous matter decussating each other, and having inteivals between them, which are more consider- able towards the centre. These intervals are filled by a soft elastic pulpy tissue, which is gradually increased in quantity towards the centre. The articulating processes of the vertebrae are connected by synovial membranes, and by ligamentous fibres ex- tended irregularly between them. Between the back part of the plates of the verte- brae, are the ligamenta sub-fiava. These ligaments close the intervals between the vertebrae, and thus complete the back part of the spinal canal.

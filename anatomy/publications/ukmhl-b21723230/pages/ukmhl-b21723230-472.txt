454< pressions for the lachrymal gland and for the trochlea anteriorly; the floor is nearly plane and looks outwards and downwards, it is formed of the malar, maxillarj’, and palate hones, the infraorbital canal extends along it: the external wall is formed by the sphenoid and malar bones, and the internal, which is smooth and plane, is formed by the lachrymal, sethmoid, and sphenoid bones. The bones which form the base of the orbit are the fron- tal, malar, and maxillary, the foramina in the base of the orbit are foui', viz. the supraorbital, the infraorbital, the malar, and the nasal duct; within the orbit are five, viz. the optic, w'hich is in the upper, inner, and posterior part, the foramen lacerum superius, which leads from the apex upwards and outwards, the two internal orbi- tal holes which are found in or close to the suture along the internal wall and the spheno-maxillary fissure, or the inferior lacerated hole which leads from the back of the orbit forwards and outwards along the floor; this slit-like opening is bounded by the sphenoid, palate, maxillary, and malar bones. The axis of the two orbits are oblique lines, which, if produced posteriorly, would decussate about the sella turcica, while anteriorly they would di- verge. The Palatine Region is composed of the palate plates of the superior maxillary and of the palate bones, and is bounded by the alveolar arch, by the pterygoid processes of the palate bones, and by the hamular processes of the sphenoid ; to its posterior edge the soft palate and uvula are attached; anteriorly it presents the foramen incisi- vum or the anterior palatine canal, and posteriorly the two posterior palatine canals. The Temporal Fossa is placed on the side of the cra- nium and face; it is bounded internally by the frontal, sphenoid, parietal and temporal bones ; its extent supe- riorly is defined by the semilunar ridge on the sid§ of the cranium, anteriorly by the malar bone, posteriorly by the pulley-like root of the zygomatic process, and in- feriorly and externally by the zygomatic arch which is formed by the processes of that name from the temporal and malar bones ; this arch is concave above and inter- nally, convex below and externally. The Zygomatic Fossa is continuous with the lower part of the last described region, from which it is dis-

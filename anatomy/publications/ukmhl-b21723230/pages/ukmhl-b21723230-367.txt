S49 power in general to dissect the eyes of the inferior ani- mals in a perfectly fresh state. The eye is situated at the anterior and internal part of the orbit, behind the conjunctiva, surrounded by muscles and fat, and connected posteriojly by the optic nerve; the axes of the eyes are parallel to each other, therefore not so to those of the orbits; each eye is nearly spherical; the antero-posterior axis, which is nearly an inch, being about one or two lines greater than the transverse or vertical axis; the cornea, which is a segnment of a smaller sphere, and which forms about the anterior fifth of the globe, being superadded to the larger sphere, formed by the sclerotic; this spherical form favours the motion of the eye-ball. The eye is composed of fluids or humours enclosed in difl’er- ent tunics; the latter are the sclerotic, choroid and retina ; the first is a fibrous, the second a vascular, and the third a nervous coat; the humours are the aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous; these are also enclosed in dis- tinct capsules. Tunica Sclerotica is a dense, opaque, fibrous membrane, extending from the optic neiwe to the cor- nea ; the nerve perforates it about a line internal to its centre by a small conical aperture, which appears tra- versed by fibres, so as to present a cribriform appear- ance ; it is doubtful however, whether this indistinct appearance may not partly depend on the central vein and artery of the retina which accompany the nerve through this opening; the sheath of the optic nerve is continuous with the fibres of this membrane ; the exter- nal surface of the sclerotic is rough, and perforated by several holes; anteriorly it receives the cornea, and is so intimately connected to it, that maceration alone can separate them ; both are sloped off obliquely as well as slightly grooved; the sclerotic overlaps the cornea; their connexion is still further secured by the conjunctiva externally, and by the membrane of the aqueous humour internally; a vertical section of this tunic from behind forw’ards w'ill shew its great thick, ness near the optic nerve, and its thinness in the centre; anteriorly it is again strengthened by tbe tendinous expansion of the recti muscles ; this expansion has been

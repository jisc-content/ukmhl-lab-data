The Ciliary Processes are sixty or seventy small triangular folds of the choroid coat, which are ar- ranged in a radiated manner around the lens on the fore-part of the vitreous humour, each extends in- wards and backwards from the ciliary ligament as far as the border of the lens; each of these processes, as well as the interstices betw^een them, are covered by the pigmentum nigrum, the term corona ciliaris is applied to this part; the anterior edge of each process is connected to the ciliarj’^ ligament and iris, the pos-

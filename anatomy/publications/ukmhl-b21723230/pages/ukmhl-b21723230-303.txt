285 The corpora pyramidalia are about an inch long, they arise gradually from the fore-part of the spinal cord above the atlas, ascend parallel to each other, increase in size, enter the pons, and they may be traced through this substance for some extent; the median fissure, which extends along the spinal cord, separates them; near the pons this fissure enlarges into a small hole (foramen caecum.) Dissect off the pia mater from these emi- nences, endeavour to separate them from each other, and about three quarters of an inch below the pons five or six white bands may be observed ascending ob- liquely from one corpus pyramidale to the other, the fasciculi of opposite sides perfectly indigitating with each other; these are the decussating fibres of the py- ramids. The corpora olivaria are oval, large in the centre, white on the surface, and containing within a corpus dentatum of grey substance; they are separated by a superficial groove from the former eminences; their up- per extremity is continued into the pons Varolii. The corpora restiformia are rather larger than the last, behind which they are placed ; they are separated from each other by a fissure which is continued from the calamus scriptorius along the posterior median line of the spinal cord; the restiform bodies are continued superiorly into the crura cerebelli, hence they are some- times named the processus a medulla spinali ad cere- bellum. ORIGIN OP THE CEREBRAL NERVES. There are nine pair of cerebral nerves; their con- nexion to the brain is named their origin ; they are dis- tinguished by the terms first, second, third, &c. &c. in every respect, those of opposite sides are symme- trical. " The FIRST PAIR or olfactory are situated beneath the anterior lobes of the brain; each arises by three fila- ments, the external very long and white from the fis- sure of Sylvius, below the corpus striatum; the inter- nal, also white, from the grey substance at the extre-

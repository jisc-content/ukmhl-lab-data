329 it is subcutaneous ; it communicates superiorly with fila- ments from the cutaneous branch of the sciatic plexus and %\-ith the external cutaneous branches of the peronseal nerve; about the middle of the leg it is increased in size, and accompanies the external saphena vein to the exter- nal malleolus, behind w'hich it passes ; it then curves for- wards along the outer edge of the foot, communicating with the external dorsal nerves of the foot and supplying the integuments and muscles on the outer side of this region. In the ham, the posterior tibial nerve gives off several very large muscular branches to the gastrocne- mius, solseus, and plantaris ; and in its course down the leg several smaller branches to the deep-seated muscles; it also sends numerous filaments around the artery ; some very small twigs pass through the interosseous space along with the anterior tihial artery, and join the anterior tibial nerve. The internal plantar nerve is larger than the external; it passes forwards along the inner side of the tarsus above the abductor pollicis, sends many branches to the plantar muscles and to the integuments, and ar- riving near the base of the great toe, divides into four digital branches; the first runs along the tibial side of the first toe; the second subdivides and supplies the opposed sides of the first and second toes ; the third, in like man- ner, the second and third toes; and the fourth the op- posed sides of the third and fourth toes : these digital nen’es also supply the lumbricales, and communicate with the dorsal nerv'es of the foot. The external plantar nerve passes forwards and outwards above the flexor brevis to the fifth metatarsal bone, and divides into two branches; one, the superficial, supplies the little toe and the outer side of the fourth ; the deep branch passes ob- liquely inwards across the metatarsus, and supplies th® interossei and the other deep plantar muscles.

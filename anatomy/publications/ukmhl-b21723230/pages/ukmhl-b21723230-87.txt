69 round its apex, covers the posterior surface, and ascend- ing on it as high as the upper edge of the left auricle, it is thence reflected on the fibrous layer in front of the posterior mediastinum; from the left auricle also it ex- tends to the left pulmonarj' veins, from which it is con- tinued to the fibrous layer, and on this we can trace it in an uninterrupted course to that point, at which we com- menced its description. The pericardium, by its fibrous lamina, is of use in fixing the heart in its situation, and strengthening its parietes so as to resist over distention ; this tunic also, by its elasticity, may assist in the subsequent contrac- tion of its cavities, while the serous layer being always lubricated by a fine fluid, facilitates the motion of the heart. When the pericardium is fully opened, the right auricle, the two cavae, the appendix of the left auricle, the right or anterior ventricle, that small portion of the left which forms the apex of the heart, the aorta and pulmonary artery, also branches of the coronary vessels, ramifying on the anterior surface of the heart, all come into view. The heart is placed obliquely between the lungs, the base of it is superior, posterior, to the right side, and near to the spine, while the apex points towards the costal end of the cartilage of the 6th rib on the left side, and during life can be felt pulsating a little above and below this rib ; the heart is retained in situ by the pericardium, and by the great vessels ; it is sub- ject, however, to a slight change of position, accord- ing as that of the body is altered, as well as from the different states of inspiration and expiration. The heart consists of four cavities, two ventricles, and two auri- cles ; these the student may examine in that order or course which the blood pursues in passing through this organ. Suppose the two venae cavae pour their blo^ into the right auricle so as to distend it, the parietes of this cavity then contract, and empty its con- tents into the right ventric)e; this next propels the blood into the pulmonary artery, the branches of which convey it through the lungs ; from these organs it is re- turned by the four pulmonary veins, two on each side, into the left auricle; from this cavity it is forced into

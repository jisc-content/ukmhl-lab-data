83 muscles are covered by the trapezius, latisslmus, and integuments, and conceal part of the serrati postici muscles. Levator Anguli Scapula;, long, and somewhat round, placed at the upper and posterior part of the side of the neck, arises by four or five tendons from the pos- terior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four or five superior cervical vertebrae; these soon terminate in a fleshy belly, which descends obliquely outwards and backwards, and is inserted into the base of the scapula, between the spine and superior angle; its use is to elevate the whole scapula, if assisted by the trapezius, or to elevate the superior angle alone, and to rotate the scapula so as to depress the acromion, thus co-operating with the lesser pectoral muscle ; it is covered by the tra- pezius ; a small portion may be seen superiorly between this and the stemo-mastoid muscle : the tendinous origins have those of the splenius colli behind them, and of the scaleni and rectus capitis anticus major before them. Divide and reflect the rhomboid muscles ; beneath these a quantity of loose cellular membrane is placed, between them and the serratus magnus, to the posterior view of which muscle the student should now attend; he may therefore again peruse the account given of that muscle, (see page 55.) Serratus Posticus Superior, arises by a thin aponeurosis from the ligamentum nuchae, and from two or three dorsal spines, forms a thin fleshy belly, which ends in three fleshy slips, which are inserted into the 2d, 3d, and 4th ribs external to their angles. Use, to expand the thorax by elevating the ribs and drawing them outwards. This muscle is covered by the trapezius and rhomboid; it lies on the splenius and the deep layer of muscles ; an aponeurosis is continued from it to the inferior serratus. Serratus Posticus Inferior, arises by a thin tendinous expansion, which is connected through â€˜the lumbar fasjiia to the two last dorsal and two upper lum- bar spines; it forms a thin fleshy expansion, which divides into three or four fasciculi, which are inserted into the lower edge of the four inferior ribs anterior to their angles. Use, by depressing the ribs it assists

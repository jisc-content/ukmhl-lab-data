421 found more convenient to describe each of these sepa- rately, in preference to considering the os innominatuni as a single bone, which however it really becomes after puberty. The Os Ilium is situated at the upper and outer part of the pelvis, and forms that projection com- monly called the hip; it is broad, flat, and triangular, the base above, and semicircular, the apex below form- ing the upper and outer part of the acetabulum; it may be divided into the body, alse, and processes. The body is the inferior constricted portion which presents three surfaces, one external, smooth, and concave, forms the upper and outer side of the acetabulum ; the second is anterior, small, triangular, and united to the pubis ; the third is posterior, and joined to the ischium. The ala is the broad fan-like portion wdiich ascends, inclines out- wards and a little forwards ; its external surface or dor- sum is irregularly convex, rough, and marked by two curved lines from which the glutaeus medius and mini- mus arise; above and behind the upper line the bone is rough for the origin of the glutaeus maximus ; the inter- nal surface of the ala is divided into three parts; one superior' and anterior, is the iliac fossa, which gives origin to the internal iliac muscle; the second is pos- terior, rough, and united to the sacrum, and the third is smooth and small, and is the only portion of the ilium that enters into the side of the true pelvis; this pelvic portion of the ilium is above the sciatic notch, and is se- parated from the fossa by an obtuse ridge which is con- tinuous behind with the promontory of the sacrum, and Irefore with a similar ridge of the pubis ; this line is named ilio-pectinea, and into the iliac portion of it the tendon of the psoas pan'us and the iliac fascia are in- serted. The processes are, first the crest, which in the young subject is an epiphysis, it forms the upper border of the ala, it is curved inwards before and outwards be- hind, and gives attachment to the three layers of abdo- minal muscles. Second, anterior superior spine, is that prominent projection at the upper and fore-part of the crest and ala, it gives attachment to the muscles and to Poupartâ€™s ligament; between this and the next pro- cess is a notch ; third, inferior spine is above the outer

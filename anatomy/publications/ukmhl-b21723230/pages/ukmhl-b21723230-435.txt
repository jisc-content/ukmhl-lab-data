4-17 terior costo-transverse ligament. External to the tuber- cle is a rough line, which marks the turn or awjf^e of the rib ; this ridge gives insertion to the tendon of the sacro- lumbalis muscle ; it descends obliquely forwards ; it is close to the tubercle on the first, but the distance between these increases in the succeeding ribs to the eleventh ; the angle is not distinct on the twelfth. The anterior or sternal end is thin, broad, and hollowed into an oval pit for the insertion of the costal cartilage. The first rib is short, broad, nearer the axis of the chest than the others^ has no angle, and therefore is not twisted, but represents nearly a horizontal semicircle ; its external surface is directed upwards, and is marked by two grooves for the subclavian vein and artery, into the intervening ridge the anterior scalenus muscle is inserted ; the head of this rib is undivided, there is no groove, the sternal end is very strong ; the eleventh rib has no groove or tubercle, its head is also undivided ; the twelfth has neither angle, tubercle, nor groove, and is very short. The ribs are formed of a cellular structure covered by compact and strong laminae, which often present a scaly appearance ; they are hard and elastic. In the foetus each rib presents three points of ossification, one for the head, another for the tubercle, and the third for the body or shaft. The Costal Cartilages are tw'elve in number ; the first is very broad but short, the length increases in the suc- ceeding to the seventh, and then decreases to the last; the first descends a little, the second is nearly horizontal, the succeeding ascend more and more; the costal end of each is convex, and implanted in the rib ; the sternal end of the seven superior in the sternum, those of the three su- perior false, are blended together, and those of the two last are pointed and unattached. The costal cartilages are the strongest and longest in the body; they are flex- ible and elastic, and have a great tendency, particularly the four or five superior, to ossification ; they then become opaque and very compact; in their natural state they ap- pear destitute of vessels, nerves, or any organic texture, but are enveloped by a vascular membrane. The Thorax, composed of the foregoing bones and cartilages, resembles a truncated cone, the base below, T 3

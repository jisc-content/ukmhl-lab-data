the second layer are the long flexor tendons, the acces- sory muscle and the lumbricales ; the third layer con- sists of the flexor pollicis brevis, adductor pollicis, trans- versalis pedis, and flexor minimi digiti; in the fourth layer are the interossei muscles, and the tendon of the peronaeus longus. / ApDucTOii Pollicis, arises tendinous and fleshy /u^from' the lower and inner part of the os calcis, from the internal annular ligament, the plantar aponeurosis, and internal intermuscular septum ; the fibres pass forwards and inwards, and are inserted tendinous into the inter- nal sesamoid bone, and into the internal side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Use, to sepa- rate the great toe from the others ; this muscle is by some writers called the adductor pollicis, its action being then referred to the mesial line of the body; it is the most in- ternal of the plantar muscles and is superficial, the fascia covering it is thin. Flexor lyiGiTORUM Brevis Perforatus, arises from the inferior alls rather from the internal part of the os calcis, from the internal annular ligament, the plantar aponeurosis and intermuscular septa ; it forms a fleshy mass, which passing forwards divides about the middle of the foot into four delicate tendons, which ac- company the flexor longus communis into the tendinous and synovial sheaths, beneath the phalanges of the four outer toes ; each tendon is slit opposite the base of the second phalanx, and having transmitted the long flexor tendon, this short tendon is then folded out on the in- ferior surface of the second phalanx, and is inserted into it, above the long flexor tendon. Use, to assist the long flexor, to strengthen the plantar fascia, and to preserve the arch of the foot; this muscle is imme- diately above the strong central portion of the plantar fascia, from which a considerable portion of it arises, it therefore always presents a rough surface, when dis- sected ; it is beneath the long flexor tendons, the acces- sory muscle, and the lumbricales ; it is joined to the ab- ductor pollicis posteriorly, but anteriorly is separated from it by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus ; the fourth or the external of its tendons, or that for tlie little toe, is sometimes wanting.

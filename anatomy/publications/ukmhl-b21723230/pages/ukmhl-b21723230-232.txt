214 is slightly curved beneath the symphysis pubis. The vagina, is directly below the urethra ; in the child it is partially closed in front by a crescentic fold of membrane, termed the hymen: in the adult several reddish emi- nences surround this opening; the course and connexions of this canal will be better seen when the pelvis shall have been divided for the purpo.se of examining the in- ternal organs of generation. Dissect off the integuments and fascia from the perinseum and labia, and the follow- ing muscles may be seen; the sphincter ani, levator ani, and coccygaeus ; these are similar to the muscles of the same name in the male perinasum, also the transversalis perinsei : the erector clitoridis is analogous to the com- pressor penis ; and the sphincter vaginae corresponds to the acceleratores urinae ; it extends from the clitoris su- periorly around each side of the vagina to the central point of the perinaeum in front of the anus. To examine the internal organs of generation make a lateral section of the pelvis in the same manner as Avas directed in the dissection of the male pelvis. The peritonaeum may be first examined ; this will be seen to descend along the fore-part of the rectum, to Avithin three or four inches of the anus ; it is thence reflected forAvards on the posterior part of the vagina, the superior third of which it coA'ers; from the vagina it ascends on the posterior surface and sides of the uterus, continues round the superior fundus of this organ to its anterior part, on which it descends as low as the commencement of the vagina; it is thence re- flected to the bladder, and is continued oA'er this organ, as in the male subject, to the abdominal muscles ; thus in the female pelvis, the peritoneum forms one cul de sac between the rectum and vagina, and another be- tAveen the uterus and bladder. From each side of the uterus a broad fold of peritoneum is extended trans- Aersely toAvards each iliac fossa ; these folds are the broad ligaments of the uterus; enclosed between the lamine of each of these are the Fallopian tube, the round ligament of the uterus, and the ovarium with its ligament and vessels. Dissect off the peritonaeura from one side of the rectum and A'agina, and the pelvic viscera Avill be more distinctly seen ; the rectum takes

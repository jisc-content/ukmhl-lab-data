93 Supra-Spinatus, fills the fossa of that name, and arises from all that portion of the scapula above its spine, which is engaged in forming this fossa, also from a strong fascia which covers the muscle ; the fibres pass forwards beneath the acromion process and triangular ligament, end in a tendon which glides over the neck of the scapula, (a bursa intervenes); inserted into the upper and fore part of the great tuberosity of the humerus, into the most anterior of the three depressions which are marked on that surface. Use, to assist the deltoid in raising and abducting the arm, it also strengthens the capsular ligament, and draws it out of the angle, which is formed by the elevation of the arm, between the hu- merus and the glenoid cavity; it also presses the head of the humerus and glenoid cavity towards each other, pre- vents the head of the former from descending out of the latter, and thus it becomes the antagonist to the pectoral, deltoid, and those other long muscles, which have a ten- dency to dislocate the head of the bone into the axilla. This muscle is covered by the trapezius, much cellular membrane, and fat, and by a strong aponeurosis; its in- sertion is concealed by the deltoid, and the large bursa beneath that muscle, also by the acromion process and triangular ligament; the tendon is inseparably connected to the capsular ligament. Infua-Spinatus, is inferior to the last, flat and tri- angular ; arises fleshy from the inferior surface of the spine of the scapula, and from the dorsum of this bone, below this process, as low down as the posterior ridge on the inferior costa, also from the aponeurosis which covers it; the inferior fibres ascend obliquely forwards, the su- perior run horizontally ; all converge, and are inserted by a strong tendon, which covers and adheres to the outer part of the capsular ligament, into the middle of the ex- ternal tuberosity of the humerus, below the supra-spinatus. Use, to assist the superior part of tlie deltoid in raising the ann, and drawing it bachwards, also in rotating it outwards ; when the arm has been raised, its lower fibres can depress it; it will also draw the capsular ligament out of the .joint, and strengthen the articulation ; it is covered by the trapezius and deltoid; but between these and the

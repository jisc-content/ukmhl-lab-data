301 both it and the frontal being; immediately beneath the periosteum; previous to entering the oblique muscle its size is somewhat increased. The Trigemini, or the. fifth pair, having formed the semilunar or gasserian ganglion, divides into three branches, the ophthalmic, the superior and inferior max- illary nerves. The Ophthalmic Nerve passes along the outer side of the cavernous sinus below the third and fourth, and above the sixth ; in this situation it receives some filaments from the sympathetic nerve ; as it approaches the foramen lacerum orbitale, it divides into three branches, the lachrv'mal, frontal, and nasal, which are situated with respect to the other nerves as above de- scribed. The lachrymal nerve, the smallest of the three, passes forwards and outwards to the lachrymal gland above the external rectus muscle and beneath the periosteum, but gives no branches to this muscle; it is surrounded by fat and accompanied by the lachrymal artery ; it sends off, in this course, two small branches, one through the spheno-maxillary fissure to communicate with the su- perior maxillary nerve, and the other through the malar bone, to communicate with the facial nerve ; near the gland the lachrymal nerve enlarges and sends four or five branches to its inferior surface, and it then terminates in several fine soft filaments on the conjunctiva, lining the superior palbebra and cellular membrane between the gland and malar bone. The frontal nerve enters the orbit, between the su- perior rectus and the periosteum, along with the fourth, but inferior and external to it; it passes forwards in a kind of groove on the upper surface of the levator pal- pebrae muscle ; and near the superciliary arch it divides into two branches, an internal and extenial; the inter- nal or supra-trochleator nerve, the smaller branch, runs forwards and inwards above the trochlea of the supe- rior oblique muscle, and is distributed to the corruga- tor supercilii, orbicularis palbebrarum, and occipito- frontalis muscles, also to the integuments ^of the fore- head and superior eyelid; it communicates with the nasal nerve, and sends one or two small filaments into

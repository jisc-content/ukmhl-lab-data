273 size and shape, and are somewhat convoluted like the intestines ; their round edges are separated by fissures which are closed by the arachnoid membrane ; these fissures are nearly an inch deep ; they take different di- rections, serpentine, longitudinal, and oblique ; if a sec- tion of the cerebrum be made, these fissures wall be found to be only involutions of the cineritious substance cover- ing the brain ; each fissure therefore is only a continua- tion of the surface, and is covered throughout by the pia mater. The cerebrum, on its inferior surface, is also divided into the tw’o hemispheres by the great median fissure at each extremity, and in the centre by a depression contain- ing several substances ; each hemisphere inferiorly is di- vided into three lobes, the anterior, small, triangular, flat, or a little concave, rests on the roof of the orbit, presents a deep groove which lodges the olfactory nerve ; the mid- dle lobe is prominent, round, and deep, fills up the mid- dle fossa in the base of the cranium, and is separated from the anterior lobe by a deep fissure, (Jissura Sylvii) which ascends obliquely outwards and backw^ards ; this fissure corresponds to the sphenoidal fold of the dura mater, and to the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone ; the brain above it is perforated by a number of small holes for the en- trance of vessels (pars perforee externe ;) this fissure contains the middle artery of the brain, and one origin of the olfactory nerve. The posterior lobe rests on the tentorium, and is separated from the middle only by a slight excaA'ation ; between the hemispheres w’e observe, immediately behind the anterior extremity of the median, fissure, the lower end of the corpus callosum ; posterior to this, and connected to it, is the commissure of the optic nerves ; behind this is a soft grey substance, the tuber cinereutn ; this is connected anteriorly to these nen’es, and posteriorly to two small w'hite bodies termed the corpora mamillaria or albicantia : these are about the size of small peas, situated behind the t^ber cinereum, and attached by it to each other; they are grey internally, although white externally, the anterior pillars of the formax terminate in these. From the centre of the tuber cinereum a thin conical tube of a N 3

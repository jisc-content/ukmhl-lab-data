m which are the anterior clinoid processes, two thick tubercles to which the extremity of the coucave edge of the tentorium is attached, each of these is perforated by the optic foramen, which is transversely oval and transmits the ophthalmic artery and the optic nerve; sometimes the anterior is united to the posterior clinoid process by bone, and sometimes to the olivary process, from each there extends forwards and outwards a thin plate of bone, the transverse spine or lesser wing, or wing of Ingrassius, this is united anteriorly to the fron- tal bone, and forms part of the orbit, it ends in a point; its posterior edge is thick and rounded, the sphenoidal fold of the dura mater is attached to it, and both occupy the fissure of Sylvius on the base of the cerebrum between its anterior and middle lobes ; each side of the sella turcica is grooved by the carotid arteiy; from its fore-part extends a small plate to join the sethmoid bone, (athmoidal process ;) from each side of the body the ala is continued outwards, forwards, and upwards; it presents three surfaces, one anterior, smooth and square forms part of the outer wall of the orbit, and is named orbital process, another is elongated and concave, and together with the temporal bone supports the middle lobe of the cerebrum; the third or external surface is named the temporal process, this is divided into two by a crest, the upper part forms a portion of the temporal fossa, and the lower of the zygomatic fossa, some fibres of the temporal and externd pterygoid muscles are at- tached to the crest itself; from the posterior part of each wing the spinous process extends backw^ards, and curves a little dowmwards and outwards, and occupies the angle between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, it terminates in a spine, the sty- loid process, on the inner side of the articulation of the lower jaw', near this process is a small foramen (spino- sum) which transmits the middle or spinous artery of the dura mater, anterior to this is the foramen ovale opening directly downwards for the passage of the infe- rior maxillary nerve ; still more anterior is the foramen rotundum, which leads forwards and transmits the su- perior maxillary nerve; between the lesser and great

467 its circumference is rougfli for the attachment of liga- ments ; the clavicle serves to support the scapula and to prevent it from falling too much forwards or inwards, it thereby allows it a greater freedom of motion, it also serves as a fixed point for certain muscles, and it pro- tects the vessels and nerves of the upper extremity; it is very perfect in the foetus, and is developed from a single point of ossification ; it has no perfect epiphysis, although in the young subject there is an osseous crust at each extremity, which is at first separable from the rest of the bone. The Scapula is situated at the upper, lateral, and pos- terior part of the chest, and extends from the second to the seventh rib, it is irregularly flat and triangular, it presents an internal and an external surface, three edges and three angles ; the internal or anterior surface or subscapular fossa looks towards the ribs, is slightly con- cave and divided by three or four prominent lines which run obliquely from above downwards, and from without inwards into several broad grooves, which are filled by the fasciculi of the subscapular muscle, the aponeurosis of which is attached to those ridges ; above and below these is a smooth flat surface to which the serratus mag- nus is attached ; the external or posterior surface or the dorsum is divided transversely into two unequal parts by a ridge or spine which commences at the posterior border of the scapula, from a smooth polished flat trian- gular surface, it proceeds forwards and becomes more elevated, flattened above and below, and bounded by a long irregular undulated margin, which is rough above for the attachment of the trapezius, and below for that of the deltoid muscle; a vascular hole is observed on its upper and under surface ; this spine is a little con- tracted anteriorly and externally, and terminates in an eminence named the acromion process; this surmounts the shoulder joint, about an inch above it, is flattened in a direction contrary to that of the spine, its external surface looks a little upwards and backwards, is convex, rather rough, and covered by the integuments, its infe- rior or internal surface is smooth and concave, its upper edge is directed backwards, gives attachment to the trapezius, and presents near its termination a small oval

IIG Lumbkicales, arise from the outer side of the ten- dons of the flexor profundus, near the carpus, a little be- yond the annular ligament; they each form a small fleshy belly, which ends in a tendon; this runs along the radial side of the finger, joins the tendon of the corresponding i.iterosseous muscle, and is inserted about the middle of the first phalanx into the tendinous expansion which covers the back part of each finger. Use, to assist in bending the first joint of the finger; they cannot act un- less the flexors are tense ; they can also adduct and ab- duct the fingers, and when the common extensor muscle is in action, they may assist in extending them ; these small muscles are covered by the superficial flexor ten- dons, palmar vessels and nerves ; the first is the largest, the fourth the smallest; the two middle run nearly parallel, but the internal and external diverge : the tendons of the lumbricales frequently divide into two portions ; one of these will be inserted into the first phalanx, the other into the posterior tendinous expansion. On the inner side of the palm of the hand are the three following muscles, which belong to the little finger. Abductor Minimi Digiti, arises fleshy from tlie annular ligament and from the pisiform bone ; its fibres run along the ulnar side of the metacarpal bone, and are inserted tendinous into the ulnar side of the first phalanx; its name implies its use ; it is superficial; a few fibres of the palmaris only cover it; its origin is partly continuous with the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti, arises from the annular ligament and unciform bone, inserted by a round tendon into the base of the first phalanx of the little fin- ger. Use, to flex and adduct the little finger ; it lies to the radial side of the last muscle, along with which it is inserted. Adductor, or Opponens Minimi Digiti, arises internal to the last, and overlapped by it, and is inserted into all the metacarpal bone of this finger : its name de- notes its use. When all the flexor and extensor tendons have been, removed, we observe the intervals between the meta- carpal bones to be filled by muscular fibres, which are called the interosseous muscles; they are divided into

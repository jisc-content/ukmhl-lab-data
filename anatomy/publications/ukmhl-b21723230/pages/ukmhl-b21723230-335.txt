317 perficial and deep, the latter of internal and external; the ascending superficial branches are two or three in number, they ascend obliquely forwards over the sterno- mastoid muscle, supply the platysma and integuments over the parotid gland, also on the ear and on the side and back part of the head, and communicate freely with the portio dura of the seventh pair of nerves; one of these is much larger than the others, is named super- Jicialis or ascendens colli, it may be traced chiefly from the third cervical, and is lost near the ear and in the parotid gland; this nerve accompanies the external jugular vein. The deep ascending branches of the plexus, are small nerves which supply the sterno mas- toid, digastric, splenius and adjacent muscles, and com- municate with the neighbouring nerves. The descend- ing branches are internal and external, the internal are two, a superficial and a deep; the superficial internal descending branch joins the descendens noni, and assists it in supplying the superficial muscles on the fore-part of the neck. The deep internal descending branch is the phrenic nerve: this arises from the lower part of the plexus, chiefly from the fourfli cervical, it has also in general a filament or two from the brachial plexus ; the phrenic nerve, or, as it is also named, the internal res- pirator)' nerve, descends obliquely inwards, on the an- terior scalenus muscle, at the lower part of the neck it communicates w'ith the lower cervical ganglion, and often with the vagus or its recurrent, it then enters the thorax between the subclavian vein and artery, and de- scends to the diaphragm on the side of the pericardium, between it and the pleura; the right phrenic is nearly perpendicular, the left takes an oblique course round the apex of the heart, it is therefore longer, and lies more posterior than the right. On the diaphragm these nerves divide into several branches, some of which ra- mify on the superior surface of that muscle, others on its inferior accompanying the phrenic vessels. These branches on the right side send some filaments to the inferior vena cava and to the liver, and unite with the nerves of this organ and with those of the stomach ; on the left side the phrenic nerve sends some filaments

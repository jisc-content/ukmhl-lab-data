289 of the face ; the auditory nerve descends obliquely for- wards, and is distributed to the cochlea and semicircular canals. . > The EIGHTH PAIR, or the Par Vagum, consists of ^ three portions,- the Glosso-piiaryngeal, the PNEu-y,.^ MO-GASTRIC, arid the Spixal Accessory : the glosso-/^^•■^vv ■ pharyngeal arises by four or five delicate filaments be-* J ^ tween the corpus olivare and restiforme ; these unite into '' ' one small nerve; the pneumo-gastric or the vagus, arises by ten or twelve filaments below the last, but in the same’ groove ; these also unite into one nerve, which, with the glosso-pharj’ngeal, passes forwards and outwards to the •foramen lacerum" posterius or jugular, where they are joined by the spinal accessor}', which arises about tbe middle of the neck from the side of the medulla spinalis by several small roots ; this nerve ascends behind the ligamentum denticulatum, and very near the posterior roots of the spinal nerves ; it frequently receives filaments from the roots of these nerves : having passed through the foramen magnum it joins the other divisions of the eighth pair, the inferior artery of the cerebellum having previously passed between them. The eighth pair of nerves passes through the jugular foramen anterior to the vein and immediately separates into its three portions, the course of which shall be considered afterwards. The spinal accessor}' is distributed to the muscles on the side of the neck ; the glosso-pharyugeal to the pharynx and the tongue, and the pneumo-gastric to the lungs and sto- mach. The N iNTii or Lingual nerve arises by six or eight ^■ fine filaments between the corpus olivare and pyramidale, ^ ’ • and behind the vertebral artery ; these unite and pass ft through the lingual or anterior condyloid hole in the oc- cipital bone. The ninth pair of nerves are distributed to the muscles of the tongue. Before the student dissects the cerebral nerves to their termination, he may examine the spinal marrow, also dis- sect tbe brain from below upwards. f>

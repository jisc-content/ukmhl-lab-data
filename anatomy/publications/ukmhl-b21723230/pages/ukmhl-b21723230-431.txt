41S bent downwards, and are not bifid ; the hole is directed obliquely upwards and outwards. This vertebra in the foetus has au additional point of ossification in the odon- toid process. It is articulated directly with the atlas and the third vertebra, and indirectly with the occipital bone. The seventh cervical vertebra is large, its spine is very promineut, and not bifid ; its transverse process is seldom perforated, as in the other cervical vertebrae; when there is a foramen in it, it transmits the vertebral vein and not the artery ; in this vertebra an additional point of ossifi- cation is found in the pedicle which connects the pro- cesses to the body; this sometimes increases beyond the transverse process, so as to resemble a supernumerary or a cenfical rib. The length of the vertebral column is generally about a third of that of the whole body ; the lumbar and cervi- cal regions are nearly equal, and each about half the length of the dorsal, the latter commonly measures twelve inches, and each of the former about six. Its general form is that of a pyramid, the base below; but when ac- curately examined it will be found to represent three pyra- mids ; the first has its apex in the third cervical vertebra, surmounted by the axis and atlas, and its base is in the first dorsal, which is also the base of the second pyramid whose ape.x is in the fifth dorsal, where also is the apex of the third pyramid, whose base is at the sacrum; the ver- tebrae diminishing in size about the fourth and fifth dor- sal. The column is convex anteriorly in the neck, con- cave in the back, and convex in the loins ; these curvatures are caused by the different thickness of the bodies of the vertebrae before and behind ; and of the intervertebral li- gaments in these three situations. A perpendicular line passed through the centre of the apex and base of the co- lumn will be found anterior to the dorsal, and posterior to the cervical and lumbar vertebrae. In the dorsal region there is generally a lateral curvature also, which is usually concave to the left side ; this direction of this curve has been by some ascribed to the pressure of the aorta on the left side, by others, and with more probability, to the ef- fect of muscular action, for as the muscles of the right arm

44.1 ral intervene; the processes enumerated are 27, viz., 5 clinoid, 1 aethmoidal, 2 lesser wings, 1 vomer, 2 spongy or triangular, 2 great wings, 2 temporal, 2 orbital, 2 spinous, 2 styloid, 4 pterygoid, and 2 hamular: the fo- ramina are 14 proper and 8 common ; the proper are, 2 optic, 2 lacerated orbital, 2 round, 2 oval, 2 spinal, 2 vidian and the 2 sinuses : the common are, 2 foramina lacera aniica basis cranii, 2 spheno-maxillary fissures, one in each orbit bounded by the orbital plates of the sphenoid, malar, maxillary and palate bones, 2 spheno- palatine, and 2 posterior palatine canals between the pterj'goid processes and the superior maxillary tuberosi- ties. The bones of the cranium are connected to each other by suture, that is, the edge of each is serrated or cut into irregular teeth-like processes, these indigitate or lock into each other, so as to unite the two edges in a very strong and motionless manner, the indentations are irregular and oblique in very thick bones, but where the edges are thin, the suture is more straight and regular, they are more distinct in the young than in the old, and on the outer than the inner surface of the cranium; there are seven sutures noticed by most anatomists, some however unnecessarily enumerate a greater num- ber, the sphenoidal, aethmoidal, coronal, sagittal, lamb- doid and two squamous. The sphenoidal suture is very extensive, it follows the irregular edge of the sphenoid Ijone, and connects it to the occipital, the temporal, inferior angle of the parietal, the frontal, and the aethmoid. The aethmoidal suture in like manner en- circles the aethmoid bone and connects it to the fron- tal. The frontal or coronal suture proceeds from the upper extremity of the sphenoidal about an inch behind the external angle of the os fronds, ascends vertically inclining a little backwards, and then de- scends to the same point on the opposite side, it con- nects the frontal and parietal bones in the manner be- fore explained. The sagittal suture leads from the superior angle of the occipital bone directly forwards between the two parietal to the centre of the coronal suture, and is sometimes continued along the median u 3

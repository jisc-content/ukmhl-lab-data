350 improperly called the tunica albuginea; the sclerotic consists of fibres which run in every direction, but which do not form distinct laminae : its internal surface is smooth and glistening ; the ciliary vessels and nervâ€™es run between it and the choroid ; from this surface a fine serous-like lamina may be raised; this is reflected on the choroid coat. The Cornea forms the anterior fifth of the eye ; it is nearly circular; its transverse diameter being a little greater than its vertical; it is very smooth and trans- parent, of a laminated, not a fibrous texture ; some fine cellular tissue connects the laminae to each other; the cornea is more thick and pulpy in the child than in the adult; it is covered anteriorly by a fine and closely adhering membrane, which though generally consi- dered a continuation of the conjunctiva, is very different from it in its structure and properties ; the concave surface of the cornea is lined by a fine elastic mem- brane, wdiich is described by some as a part of the membrane of the aqueous humour; it is, however, a membrane sui generis; it is best seen in the eye of a horse, which has been macerated for some days; the ex- ternal laminae, which are now opaque, can be peeled off, leaving behind it this elastic cornea, which preserves its proper curve and transparency; if it be cut it will curl upon itself, thus exhibiting true elastic cartilagi- nous properties. Fix the eye in a small shallow vessel, which can be immersed occasionally under water, carefully raise a small portion of the sclerotic, pass in some air between it and the choroid, these mem- branes can thus be easily separated; then dissect off the sclerotic; this tunic can be readily detached as far as the cornea, here it adheres to the ciliary li- gament: this connexion may be separated with the handle of the knife, the cornea, or one-half of it, may also be removed with the sclerotic and the next tunic of the eye will be exposed, the choroid, with its ap- pendages, the ciliary ligament, ciliary processes, and iris. The Choroid coat extends from the optic nerve all round the eye, between the sclerotic and retina, as far as -the ciliary ligament, where it appears on the exter- ,?

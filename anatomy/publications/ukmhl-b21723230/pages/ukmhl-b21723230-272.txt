254 phalanx ; each of the last named tendoas is slit for the transmission of the long flexor tendon, which continues to run forwards to be inserted into the last phalanx of each of the four lesser toes. Use, to flex the toes and the metatarsus, to extend the ankle, and to steady the leg on the foot as when standing. This muscle in the leg is covered by the superficial muscles, the deep fascia and the tibial vessels ; it overlaps the tibialis pos- ticus and is on the inner or tibial side of the flexor pollicis ; a little above the inner ankle, the tendon of the tibialis posticus crosses above that of the flexor communis, that is, becomes nearer to the tibia; in the sole of the foot its direction is horizontal, it is there supe- rior to the flexor brevis, inferior to the transversalis p^is and peronaeus longus tendon ; the lumbricales muscles arise from its tendons. Tibialis Posticus, larger above than below, arises from the posterior and internal part of the fibula, from the upper part of the tibia, and from almost the entire length of the interosseous ligament; the fibres descend, and end in a strong tendon which passes along with that of the last muscle behind the internal ankle, crosses above that tendon, and then proceeds obliquely" forwards and inwards, and is inserted into a tuberosity on the inferior and internal part of the os navicnlare, and into the internal cuneiform bone ; it also sends some fibres to the cuboid and to the second and third metatarsal bones ; a small bony or cartilaginous tuber- cle is often found in this tendon, near to its insertion, beneath the head of the astragalus ; it also glides over a small bursa in this situation. Use, to extend the ankle, and to raise the inner edge of the foot from the ground ; the upper end of this muscle is notched by the anterior tibial vessels, a few of its fibres accompany these vessels through the interosseous space, and are attached to the anterior surface of the ligament; in its course down the leg it is covered by the soleeus, and overlapped bj- the flexor communis and flexor pollicis, it covers the tibia, fibula and interosseous ligament; it passes beneath the head of the astragalus, and supports that strong fibro-cartilage, which extends from the os calcis to the os naviculare, beneath the head of the

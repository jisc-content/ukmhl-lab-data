259 tlescribed muscle. Use, to approximate the toes, and to contract the transverse arch of the foot: behind this mus- cle the strong calcaneo-cuboid ligament is observed, also the tendon of the tibialis posticus dividing into several slips, which are inserted into the adjacent bones and liga- ments. Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti, arises tendinous and fleshy from the cuboid and fifth metatarsal bone, and from the sheath of the peronaeus longus tendon; it passes forwards and outwards, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe. Use, to flex and adduct this toe. This muscle is connected to the abductor minimi digiti ; it fills up the concavity of the fifth metatarsal bone. Detach these four muscles in this layer from the tarsus, and the fourth layer will come into view, namely, the tendon of the peronaeus longus and the interossei mu.scles ; the former crosses the foot ob- liquely forwards and inwards from a deep groove in the CMboid, beneath the cuneiform and metatarsal bones, to be inserted into the internal cilneiform, and into the base of the first and secontl metatarsal bojies ; in this coume this strong round tendon is enclosed in a tendinous sheath, which is lined by synovial membrane, and is at- tached to the several projections of the adjoining bones. Use, to sen'e as a strong transverse ligament in strength- ening the tarsus and metatarsus in that direction ; this course and connexion of the tendon explains the action of the peronaeus longus muscle, namely, to extend the ankle joint, to elevate the external side of the foot, to de- press its internal side, and to turn the point of the foot outwards. Interossei Muscles are seven in number; three are seen in the sole of the foot, and four on the dorsum ; they fill up the interstices betw'een the metatarsal bones : the three inferior are named interossei interni or infe- riores; they arise tendinous and fleshy from between the metatarsal bones of the four external toes, and are inserted tendinous into the inner side of the base of tlie first phalanx of the three lesser toes. Use, to adduct the toes. The Jirst of the inferior interossei is situated between

362 cous membrane, and to inosculate with branches of the labial artery; between the pterygoid muscles it sends off, 3rd, the deep temporal branches, one pos- terior, the other anterior ; these supply the muscle and ascend close to the bone ; 4th, masseteric; 5th, ptery- goid; 6th, buccal, to the buccinator muscle, the fat and integuments of the cheek; 7th, superior dental, which winds round the maxillary tuberosity and sends branches into the alveoli and to the gums; in the spheno-maxillary fossa it gives off, 8th, infra-orbital, which passes along the canal of that name, is distributed to the muscles of the face, and communicates with the arteries of that region; 9th, nasal passes inwards through the spheno-palatine hole, and is distributed to the mucous membrane on the spongy bones and on the septum; 10th, the superior palatine descends along the posterior palatine canal, and is distributed to the muscles and to the mucous membrane of the palate, principally to the hard palate; 11th, ihe vidian; this is a small branch which passes backwards, and takes the course of the first part of the vidian nerve; these terminating branches of the internal maxillary artery are entangled with the divisions of the superior maxillary nerve. The internal carotid artery ascends along the verte- bral column and the side of the pharynx from the com- mon carotid, posterior and external to the external ca- rotid, behind the digastric and styloid muscles, internal to the jugular vein and anterior to the vagus and sym- pathetic nerves, to the foramen caroticum in the pe- trous bone ; it then bends tortuously forwards, upwards, and inwards, through the carotid canal, accompanied by the superior branches of the sympathetic, enters the cavernous sinus, through which it makes two remarkable turns internal to the sixth pair of nerves, and arriving at the anterior clinoid process, it bends upwards and backwards, and a little outwards, and opposite the in- ternal extremity of the fissure of Syhfius it divides into its three terminating branches, it first gives off the oph- thalmic artery: in the neck, and in the carotid canal, it sends small and unimportant branches to the surround- ing parts.

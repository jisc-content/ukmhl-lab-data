300 these should unite in the optic foramen; the inter- nal is to be carried forward to the superciliary arch about half an inch external to the internal angular process ; the external incision is to be carried deep- ly through the malar bone ; a slight blow with the hammer will then throw forwards the roof of the or- bit, and the bone will separate easily from the peri- osteum. The THIRD PAIR, or motores oculorum, in passing through the foramen lacerum orbitale, divide into two branches, a superior and inferior ; the superior, or the smaller, passes between the heads of the external rectus muscle and over the optic and nasal nerves, and divides into two branches, the smaller and shorter one of which supplies the superior rectus, the other the levator pal- pebrae muscle. The inferior or the larger branch passes below' and to the outside of the optic ner\’e and divides into three branches, an internal, middle, and ex- ternal ; the internal is the largest, it passes obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, beneath the optic nerve, and getting to its internal side is distributed to the internal rectus, the middle to the inferior rectus; and the external, which is the longest, passes downwards and forwards on the surface of the inferior rectus, betw’een it and the globe of the eye, (it gives no filaments to this muscle, and is lost in the inferior oblique muscle; this last branch gives off from its root a small short filament to the ophthalmic ganglion. All the branches of the third pair are distributed to the ocular surface of the muscles. The Trochleator, or fourth nerve, having entered the orbit by the foramen lacerum, ascends obliquely forwards and inwards above the levator palpebrse and the superior rectus, and is distributed by four or five fine branches to the upper sui face of the superior ob- lique muscle ; as this delicate nerve is passing along the outer side of the cavernous sinus, it lies betw’een the third pair and the ophthalmic branch of the fifth, below the former and above the latter and the sixth; as it enters the orbit it mounts above the third and fifth, and is therefore the highest nerve in the orbit,

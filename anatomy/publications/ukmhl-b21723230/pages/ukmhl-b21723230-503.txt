4S5 these adhesions are the most common morbid appear- ances found in the dead body. Parts of tlie pleura are occasionally found converted, into bony plates, varying in thickness, and covering a considerable portion of the membrane; no inflammation surrounds these bony de- positions, and as no spiculae are formed on their surface which might create irritation, little inconvenience at- tends their growth. Lungs. Inflammation of the lungs is almost always attended with a corresponding affection of the pleura ; the inflamed portion has a darker and more florid colour than natural, with an e.xtravasation of coagulable lymph, alnd sometimes of blood, into the substance of the lungs; the weight of the part is increased, owing to the extra- vasation of these fluids, and therefore it commonly sinks in water ; this state, however, is to be distinguished from the accumulation of blood in the more depending parts after death, in consequence of gravitation; blood ac- cumulated from gravitation is always of a darker coloiir, and liable to change its position; whereas blood ac- cumulated in an inflamed part is more florid in its ap- pearance, and remains stationary in every position of the body. Abscess of the Lung. There are two kinds of abscesses found in the lungs, one small, generally arising from the suppuration of one or more tubercles, the other, which is the common scrofulous abscess, engaging nearly the whole of the substance of tlie lung, they dis- charge themselves by ulcerated openings, generally into the trachea, or opening into the cavity of the thorax, they pour out their contents; and this is one of the causes of empyema. Tubercles of the lungs. There is no morbid appear- ance more common in the lungs than that of tubercles ; they consist of round firm bodies, formed in the cellular .substance, connecting the air cells of the lungs together; they are at first very small, not being larger than the heads of pins, though the ordinary size is that of a pea; when many of the smaller ones are clustered together, they probably grow into one another, and form large tubercles; they have no evident capsules, and possess little or no vascularity ; when cut into, they present a white firm texture, and they often- in part contain a

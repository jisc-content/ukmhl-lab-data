319 number and divide into anterior and posterior; tlie former descend behind the clavicle in front of the axil- lary artery, subdivide into branches which accompany the thoracic arteries, supply the pectoral muscles, and communicate with cutaneous branches from the intercos- tal nerves ; the posterior thoracic nerves descend behind the vessels to the serratuS magnus, posterior scalenus and rhomboid muscles. The suprascapular nerve arises from the upper division of the plexus, descends obliquely backwards, parallel to the omo-hyoid mus- cle, to the superior costa of the scapula, passes beneath the posterior ligament which converts the notch in this part of the bone into a foramen, it then gives off a con- siderable branch to the supra-spinatus muscle and pro- ceeds beneath the acromion process and behind the neck of the scapula to the infra-spinous fossa, where it is distributed to the infra-spinatus and teres muscles. The subscapulat nerves are three or four in number, they arise from different parts, but chiefly from the upper division of the plexus, they descend behind the vessels and ramify in the sub-scapular, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles. Internal cutaneous nerve, is a long but delicate nerve, it arises out of the lower divi- sion of the plexus, descends nearly perpendicularly along the inner side of the arm, at first covered by the brachial aponeurosis, near the elbow it becomes cuta- neous, and runs parallel to the basilic vein, and divides into two branches, an external and internal; the exter- nal passes along the border of the biceps over the bend of the elbow to the fore-arm, where it divides into seve- ral filaments, some of which descend in the integuments as low as the wrist, and communicate with the other cutaneous nerves; this branch generally crosses the median basilic vein, in some it lies superficial to it, in others behind it; the internal branch descends towards the internal condyle, and divides into several filaments, some of which descend along the inner, and others along the posterior part of the fore-arm; they all ter- minate in the integuments. External cutaneous nerve, or musculo-cutaneous or perforans casserii, is larger than the last, and arises from the upper division of the plexus, it descends obliquely outwards, through

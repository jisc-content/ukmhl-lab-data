STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBELLUM. Trace the restiform body upwards into the crus ce- rebelli; divide this substance vertically, and the former may be seen continued into the mass of grey substance in the crus known by the name of corpus dentatum, or the ganglion of the cerebellum ; from the inner edge of this a narrow white fasciculus may be traced inwards towards the median line ; it there unites with a similar process from the opposite side, and both divide into several fine bands, which diverge and form the vermiform process, (or the primary portion of the cerebellum;) the periphe- ral extremities of these fibres are covered by cineritious substance, and present, when cut vertically, an arborescent appearance ; the remainder, or the principal portion of the restiform body, passes upwards and outwards through the coipus dentatum, and then dindes into several pro- cesses or stalks which diverge through each hemisphere and subdivide into finer branches, each of which is co- vered by the grey substance on the surface ; a vertical section of either hemisphere presents also that arbores- cent appearance known by the name of arbor vitae. The converging fibres of the cerebellum are inferior and supe- rior ; the latter are very delicate and rather indistinct in their course ; they consist of several fibres which issue from the vermiform process and unite in one

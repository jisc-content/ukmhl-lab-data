82 ferior, the lumbar muscles, and the angle of the scapula; its humeral end forms the posterior fold of the axilla; a fasciculus of fleshy fibres sometimes passes across the floor of this region, and connects the latissimus to the great pectoral muscle ; between the angle of the scapula and the humerus this muscle has a twisted appearance, the lumbar and costal fibres being inserted into the upper part of the tendon, und the superior or dorsal portion into its inferior edge ; the axillary vessels and nen^es lie on this tendon at its insertion, and the bici- pital groove is lined by aponeurotic fibres derived from it, and from the tendon of the great pectoral, which are thus united to each other, although previous to this they are separated by the brachial vessels and nerves, and by the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles. Divide the trapezius and latissimus longitudinally be- tween the spine and the scapula, reflect one portion to- wards the vertebrae, the other towards the side, and the second layer of the dorsal muscles will be exposed. (In dissecting off the latissimus take care not to injure the serratus inferior, which is very thin, and adheres closely to it.) The second layer of muscles consists of the rhom- boid, levator anguli scapulae, serratus inferior and supe- rior, and the splenii; a considerable portion of each of these is now seen, although they partly conceal each other. Rhomboideus is broad, thin, and the most super- ficial of this la3"er ; it is divided into a superior or minor portion, and an inferior or major ; the minor arises from the lower part of the ligamentum nuchae, and from the last cervical spinous process; the fibres run parallel outwards, and a little do^^^lwards, and are inserted into the base of the scapula, opposite to and above the spine. The major arises from Ihe faur or five superior dorsal spines ; the fibres pass outwards and downwards, parallel to the former, and are inserted into the base of the scapula, extending fi;pm the spine to the inferior angle. Use, to draw the shoulder i backwards and upwards; the inferior fibres also can, by pulling.back the inferior angle, rotate the scapula,! so as to depress the acromion process. The rhomboid j

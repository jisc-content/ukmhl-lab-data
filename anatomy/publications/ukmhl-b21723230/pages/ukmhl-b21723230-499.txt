481 examination is completed, and a view sufficiently ex- tensive for common purposes, be obtained of its con- tents. The practice of making a crucial incision for the purpose of examining the contents of the abdomen, should always be condemned, and .should never super- sede the longitudinal, as a view sufficiently extensive for every purpose is obtained by the latter; while the escape of fluids, and the unsightly appearances of the seams produced by the former method, are entirely pre- vented. THE MOST COMMON MORBID APPEARANCES FOUND IN THE BRAIN. Dura mater. The dura mater is sometimes found in a state of inflammation ; to an inexperienced eye this appearance is difficult of detection, as in the inflamed state, very few vessels more appear carrying florid blood, than in the natural state ; still, however, a person well acquainted with the natural appearance of the mem- brane, would be as much struck with the differences of its appearance when inflamed, as he would be with that of any other part of the body; in injuries from exteimal violence, where inflammation follows, suppuration some- times occurs, and the arachnoid coat lining the dura mater is found covered with pus, which immediately settles the question of inflammation having existed. Scrofulous and spongy tumours growing from the dura mater, producing absorption of the bone, or pressure on the brain, are occasionally found ; another diseased ap- pearance, although not very common, is a deposition of bony lamina in some part of the dura mater, more par- ticularly in the falciform process or near the superior longitudinal sinus. Tunica arachnoides. The most common and almost the only diseased structure observed in the tunica arach- noides, is an opaque or in some instances a thickened state of the membrane, which gives it a tolerably firm consistence; serous fluid sometimes of a gelatinous nature, is found between it and the pia mater; and although these appearances are said to depend on in- Y

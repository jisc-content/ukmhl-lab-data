180 pelvis, or the body on the thigh; it also rotates the thigh outwards ; in standing it supports the spine, and prevents it bending backwards, and in walking it is particularly engaged ; it then raises, throws forwards and outwards the lower extremity. This muscle is situated between the psoas panms and the quadratus lumborum above, and between the former muscle and the iliacus below ; and in the groin, between the sartorius and the pecti- naeus : its insertion is between the vastus internus and the pectinaeus ; it is covered in the lumbar region by the diaphragm, the kidney, and its vessels ; also on the right side by the vena cava, and on the left by the aor- ta ; in the middle or pelvic division of its course it lies between the external iliac vessels and the iliac muscle and the anterior crural nerve; in its lower or inguinal division it is partly covered by the femoral artery and neiwe, and by some of their branches, also by the in- guinal glands, and by a considerable quantity of cellular membrane. The psoas lies anterior to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, to the quadratus lumborum, the lumbar nerves, the inner edge of the iliacus internus, and the capsular ligament of the hip; the lumbar nerves or the lumbar plexus in general r\m through the psoas, perforating its posterior portion ; a large bursa separates its tendon from the pubes and from the capsular ligament ; this bursa sometimes com- municates with the sjTiovial membrane of the hip joint. A smaller bursa lies between the point of the lesser trochanter and this tendon. The tendon of the psoas is formed in the outer or iliac side of the muscle, and receives the insertion of the fibres of the iliacus inter- nus. ItriACUS Inteunus, flat, or concave, radiated or tri- angular, arises fleshy from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, from the inner margin of three anterior fourths of the crest of the ilium, from the two anterior spinous processes, and from the inteia-ening notch, from the brim of the acetabulum, and from the capsular ligament, also from the iliac fossa, and from the strong aponeurosis, the iliac fascia, which covers it. The iliac fascia is attached to the crest of the

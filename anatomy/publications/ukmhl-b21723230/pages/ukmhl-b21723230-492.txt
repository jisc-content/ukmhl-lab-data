474 leading downwards and forwards, and divided into two for the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pol- licis; the border between these two last grooves is pro- longed down into the styloid process, from which the external lateral ligament of the wrist arises ; on the in- ternal border is an oblong smooth cavity, to receive the lower end of the ulna ; inferiorly the radius presents an articular surface, divided by a line from before back- wards, into two unequal portions ; the external is large and triangular, and meets the scaphoid bone ; the inter- nal is smaller, somewhat square, and meets the lunar bone. The radius, like other long bones, is of a cellular structure at each extremity, and compact in the centre, Avhere it also contains a medullary canal, which is larger above than below ; it is developed from three points of ossification, one for the shaft and one for each extremity. The Hand consists of the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers. The carpus is composed of eight bones, arranged in two rows ; the first row consists of the scaphoid, lunar, cuneiform, and pisiform ; the second of the trapezium, trapezoid, magnum, and unciform, enumerating them from the radial to the ulnar side, or from without in- wards. The scaphoid is the largest in the upper row, at the upper and outer side of which it is situated ; it presents four articular surfaces ; it is elongated and convex on the upper or radial surface, adapted to the external depression on the end of the radius ; the inferior surface directed a little outwards and backwards, is triangular, smooth, and convex, to articulate with the trapezium and trapezoides; into the posterior narrow surface ligaments are inserted; to the external or radial side, the external lateral liga- ment is attached ; the inner or ulnar side presents two smooth articulating surfaces ; one superior, nhrrowq to ar- ticulate with the lunar bone; the other inferior, large and concave, to articulate w'ith the magnum. The semicircular or lunar bone is smaller than the scaphoid ; it presents four articulating surfaces ; smooth and convex above to meet the radius, concave belowr to articulate with the magnum and unciform ; its ulnar

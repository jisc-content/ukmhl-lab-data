504 The close connexion of the bones of the carpus, and the numerous ligaments, spread in all directions over the back and front of the hand, present powerful ob- stacles to complete dislocations of any of these bones: in fact, surgeons of the greatest experience have never met with such an accident. The only part of the arti- culation at ■which it is likely to occur, is w'here the head of the os magnum is received into the depression of the semilunar and scaphoid bones, because here the quan- tity of motion is greatest; how’ever it is almost invaria- bly incomplete. OF DISLOCATIONS OF THE THUMB. The first metacarpal bone may be dislocated from its articulation with the trapezium forwards or backwards ; in the backward luxation the carpal extremity of the bone is driven through the posterior part of the capsular liga- ment. It does not appear necessary that the lateral ligaments should be ruptured. The flexor ossis meta- carpi, and flexor brevis and longus, wdth the adductor, offer great resistance to reduction when delayed for any time. In dislocation forwards the metacarpal bone is thrown between the trapezium and the root of the second me- tacarpal bone. The thumb is bent back, and cannot be flexed. The external lateral ligament is in this case more likely to be torn than in the former. The exten- sors of the thumb are the muscles ■which offer resistance to reduction of this dislocation. OF DISLOCATION OF THE FIRST PH.VLANX OF THE THUMB. The first phalanx of the thumb is frequently dislo- cated backwards, from the head of the metacarpal bone. The lateral ligaments remain uninjured. This disloca- tion is interesting from the great difficulty of reducing it ■when neglected even for a short time. The pha- langes of the other fingers may be dislocated either backwards or forwards, but present nothing ■worthy of attention.

452 the alveoli, with each of which it communicates ; it con- tains the dental nerve and vessels; below the incisors this canal turns back a little and ends at the mental hole ; this canal is nearer the inner surface of the jaw behind, and the outer surface before; the ramus ends above in a notch and two processes, the anterior or coro- noid, the posterior or condyloid ; the notch is traversed by the masseter nerve and vessels. The coronoid pro- cess is triangular, the apex is inclined a little outwards, it is embraced by the insertion of the temporal muscle. The condyle is an oblong convex process supported by a neck which is most depressed anteriorly, for the inser- tion of the external pterygoid muscle; the condyle is curved forwards and most convex in that direction ; it is directed obliquely backwards and inwards, so that its in- ternal extremity is posterior, it is also higher than the external; its posterior surface is nearly straight and al- most free from cartilage. By these processes the lower maxilla is articulated with the temporal bones; on the external edge of each is a tubercle for the insertion of the external lateral ligament. The lower jaw in the young subject always consists of two symmetrical pieces. The Teeth are small, hard bones, thirty-two in num- ber, sixteen in each jaw; their form is generally coni- cal the apex in the alveoli; in each tooth|we distinguish the crown, neck, and root; the crown is external to the alveolus, it has no periosteum, but is covered b} a firm white vitreous substance, named enamel: the neck is surrounded by the gum, and the root is firmly held in the alveolus by a mode of connexion called gomphosis. The teeth are divided into three classes, the incisores, the canini, and the molares: the incisores are four in each jaw, the crown of these is sharp, and wedge- shaped, convex before and thickly covered with enamel; those in the upper are stronger than those in the lower jaw; the former are broader, their edge is like a chisel, cut off posteriorly, the latter are more vertical, their an- terior surface is bevelled off, but they are not so sharp as those in the upper jaw, their roots are larger: the canine teeth or cuspidati are two in each jaw, the crown is conical, a little blunt, convex before, their root is sin-

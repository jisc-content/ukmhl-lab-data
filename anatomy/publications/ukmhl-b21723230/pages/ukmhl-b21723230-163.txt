145 testines, according as they are contracted or distended. The student may next examine the anatomy of the peritonceum; this is the largest serous sac or mem- brane in the body ; it lines the abdominal muscles^ and covers almost ^1 the abdominal viscera; that por- tion which adheres to the parietes is called the pa- â– fietal, and that covering the viscera the visceral layer. The peritonaeum is a shut sac, and therefore when opened presents one continued surface, which may be traced throughout the whole extent without any inter- ruption ; it covers the viscera in such a manner as that they lie external or posterior to it; the familiar example of the double night-cap on the head has been, not unaptly, adduced, to explain how the vis- cera may be covered by the peritonaeum, and yet really lie beneath it or behind it. Let us now trace this membrane through its entire extent, commencing' at the umbilicus ; from the transverse incision that was made into it in this situation, we may perceive it to ascend on the internal surface of the transverse and recti muscles, as high as the margin of the tho- rax ; then bending back, it adheres to the inferior surface of the diaphragm, and continues very far back on this muscle, particularly in the left hypochon- drium; from the diaphragm it is reflected on the spleen on the left side, on the stomach in the centre, and on the liver on the right side ; it is also reflected on this last named viscus by a distinct fold, the falci- form or suspensory ligament, from the umbilicus, and from the abdominal muscles on the right side of the linea alba ; as the peritonaeum is reflected from the diaphragm on each side of these organs in the epi- gastric and hypochondriac regions, it forms folds, which to a certain extent serve as ligaments ; these will be noticed more particularly in the exami- nation of the individual viscera. Having covered the organs in the upper division of the abdomen, it is continued downwards in the following manner: having invested both surfaces of the liver as far as its trans- verse fissure; it is conducted along and around the vessels of this gland towards the lesser curvature of the stomach; this fold, which thus surrounds the he- II

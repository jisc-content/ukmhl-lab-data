112 and fleshy from the posterior and inferior part of the external condyle, forms a thick triangular mass, which adheres to the synovial membrane and descends ob- liquely inwards, to be inserted into the external surface of the olecranon, and about tlie superior fifth of the posterior surface of the ulna. Use, to extend the fore- arm on the arm, and to raise the synovial membrane out of the articulation : this muscle is partly covered by the tendon and aponeurosis of the triceps ; the re- mainder of it is superficial; it is situated between the olecranon and the extensor carpi ulnaris; it often ap- pears as a continuation of the triceps; it covers the ar- ticulation of the elbow and a portion of the supinator brevis. Extensor Minimi Digiti, arises in common with the last, and descends between it and the extensor carpi ulnaris; it forms a small fleshy belly, which descends very obliquely inwards, and ends in a slender tendon ; this passes through a separate groove in the radius, and and also through a distinct division of the annular liga- ment, in Avhich situation it is frequently found divided into two, which continue in contact, and afterwards unite; this tendon becomes attached to the fourth ten- don of the extensor communis, and is inserted along with it into the posterior part of the phalanges of the little finger. Use, to assist the extensor communis. The deep muscles in this situation will be exposed, by removing the superficial layer; they consist of the supinator radii brevis, three extensors of the thumb, and the indicator. Supinator Radii Brevis, short and flat, surrounds the upper part of the radius, arises from the external condyle, external lateral and coronary ligaments, and from a ridge on the outer side of the ulna, which com- mences below its lesser sigmoid cavity; the fibres ad- here to the capsular ligament, and descend obliquely outwards and forwards, round the upper part of the ra- dius, and are inserted into the upper third of the exter- nal and anterior surface of this bone, from above its tubercle down to: the insertion of the pronator teres. Use, to turn the radius outwards, so as to make the hand look supine. This muscle is covered by the supi.

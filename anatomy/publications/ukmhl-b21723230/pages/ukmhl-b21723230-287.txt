969 in the inferior angle of the parietal; it then descends in- wards along the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and again indenting the occipital, it turns forwards, and passing through the foramen lacerum posterius, ends in the internal jugular vein ; each lateral sinus receives several small veins from the posterior lobes of the cere- brum and from the cerebellum ; these enter the sinus from without inwards, contraiy to the current in the sinus ; through each of these sinuses all the blood is re- turned from the cranium to the general system ; there are seldom any transverse bands or glandulae Pacchioni in these sinuses. The following sinuses are situated on the base of the cranium. The cavernous sinus on each side extends from the anterior clinoid process to tlm point of the petrous bone along the side of the body of the sphenoid ; the dura mater in this region divides into two layers, one very thin adheres to the irregular bony surface which bounds this cavity, the other much more dense is reflected over this space, and contains between its laminae the third and fourth nerve, and the first part of the fifth; the ophthalmic vein opens into the fore- part of this sinus, and the two petrosal sinuses lead from it posteriorly to the lateral sinus ; this sinus is in- tersected by tendinous bands, and presents rather a cel- lular or spongy appearance like the corpus cavernosum penis ; the internal carotid artery and the sixth or ab- ducens nerve pass through the cavity of this sinus, also several small branches from the sympathetic; the venous membrane, however, is reflected around each, so as to separate them from the blood ; the cavernous sinuses com- municate through the following ; the circular sinus con- sists of two small veins, which lead from one cavernous sinus to the other, the anterior is beneath the optic com- missure, and before the pituitary gland; the posterior is behind and rather below that body. The petrosal simises are four in number, two on each side, the superior and inferior; they each lead from the cavernous sinuses back- wards, the former along the upper edge of the petrous bone, to the lateral sinuses opposite the inferior angle ot the parietal bone ; the inferior petrous sinus leads down- wards and backwards, over the suture between the petrous

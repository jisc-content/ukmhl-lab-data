318 to the oesophagus and stomach, these communicate with the vagus and solar plexus. The phrenic nerve can be traced into the spinal canal, and be seen to arise distinctly from the side of the spinal marrow. The external descending branches of the cervical plexus are numerous, some are superficial, others deep, the superficial descend to the clavicle and acromion pro- cess, supply the superficial muscles in their course, and terminate in the pectoral and deltoid muscles and in the integuments ; the deep branches descend behind the clavicle, supply the deep muscles on the side of the neck and those connected to the scapula; one of these branches is remarkable for its length, it is of the same size as the phrenic, and is named the external respiratory nerve of the trunk ; this nerv^e proceeds from the back part of the plexus, chiefly from the fourth cer- vical, it has also filaments connecting it to the third and second, and to the phrenic, it descends behind the sca- leni muscles and beneath the trapezius and levator anguli scapulae, and is almost exclusively distributed to the ser- ratus magnus muscle. The Brachial Plexus is formed by the junction of the anterior branches of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical, and of the first dorsal; this plexus is broad and flat, the nerves forming it are very large, par- ticularly the inferior; it is situated at the inferior and lateral part of the neck, between the scaleni muscles and above the subclavian artery, it then descends obliquely outwards beneath the clavicle and subclavian muscle and over the first rib, into the axilla, where it rests on the serratus magnus behind the axillary artery and vein. The fifth and sixth cervical unite first, the seventh cervical runs alone for some distance, the eighth cervi- cal and first dorsal unite immediately, so that, at first this plexus consists of three roots, these however soon unite, and in the axilla again separate and subdivide into several branches: the branches of this plexus are the thoracic, supra and sub-scapular, the internal and exter- nal cutaneous, the median, ulnar, musculo-spiral, and circumflex. The thoracic branches arise principally from the upper part of the plexus, are four or five in

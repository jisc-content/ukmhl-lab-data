284 this great fissure separates the superior from the infe- rior surface. The central portion of the cerebelhim is narrow, and raised superiorly into a small conical pro- cess, the superior vermiform process; this overlaps the valve of Vieussens, the tubercula quadrigemina, and the processus a cerebello ad testes; inferiorly there is a deep depression, which contains, anteriorly, the com- mencement of the spinal cord, and posteriorly a large process, the inferior vermiforifi, which is marked by numerous transverse lines or fissures, which divide it into several laminae or lobules. Divide either hemis- phere parallel to, and about an inch from the median line, a thick mass of white substance is seen in the centre, branching out into fine fibres, which extend into the lobes, and again subdivide into fine filaments, which pass to every lamina or lobule on the surface, and are there covered by a thin layer of grey sub- stance : nearly in the centre of this white mass, which is continuous superiorly with the processus ad testem, and inferiorly with the crus cerebelli, is a small oval mass of grey substance, its. edges convoluted or ser- rated; this is the corpus dentatum or rhomboideum; the white substance which is continued from the me- dulla oblongata to the crus cerebelli, appears to run through this, and thus to be increased in quantity: hence it is named by some the ganglion of the cere- bellum. DISSECTION OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata is that conical portion of white substance which extends from the lower margin of the pons Varolii to the spinal cord, about an inch in length, large above, narrow below, where it passes through the foramen magnum, divided by longitudinal lines into six oval eminences placed parallel to each other; the median line anteriorly separates the two cor- pora pyramidalia; next to each of these is a slight groove, external to which is the corpus olivare, behind which is a groove and another eminence, the corpus res- tiforme or the posterior pyramid.

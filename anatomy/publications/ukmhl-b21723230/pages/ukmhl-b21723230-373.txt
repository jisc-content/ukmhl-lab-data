355 being enclosed in a fine membrane, it has a gelatinous consistence; this membrane is called hyaloid, it en- closes the fluid, and sends processes into it, so as to divide the whole mass into numerous cells, which com- municate so freely that air injected will rapidly distend them; or if one or two openings be made in this cap- sule, the whole of the fluid will gradually escape ; an- teriorly the crystalline lens is connected to this humour by the hyaloid membrane separating into two laminae; external to the lens, the ciliary processes and the in- tervening pigment mark it in a striated manner, like the disk of a flower; this appearance, therefore, has been called the ciliary disk, or corona ciliaris ; the vitreous humour serves to support and expand the retina, and the other tunics of the eye, also, in transmitting the rays of light from the lens, it prevents their too rapid converg- ence, and thus causes an image of larger size to be painted on the retina. SECTION V. OF THE SKIN. TiiE integument of the body is composed of one con- tinued membrane, which is very dense, at the same time very extensible ; at the several orifices, it is continuous wnth the mucous membranes, a vascular line alone marks the distinction betw'een them : by maceration or putre- faction the skin may be divided into three laminae, the cuticle, rete mucosum, and cutis vera. The cuticle or epidermis is the external layer of the skin, it is dry, thin, and transparent, and destitute of nerves and ves- sels, it is most intimately connected to the cutis by nu- merous fine hairs which pass through it, also by the se- veral exhalant and absorbent vessels that open on its sur- face by very minute pores ; in some situations it is very dense and opaque, as in the hands and feet; it is conti- nued as a very fine pellicle into the different orifices, and can be traced for a considerable distance on the mucous membranes, thus, from the lips it e.xtends over the.

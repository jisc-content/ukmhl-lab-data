120 the outer side of the radial artery, and supplying the adjacent muscles ; near the elbow it gives off the poste- rior interosseous nerve and a little below the middle of the forearm it passes beneath the tendon of the supina- tor, and becomes cutaneous, being distributed to the integuments of the thumb and back of the hand.

OF THE MUSCLES ON THE ANTERIOR AND LATERAL PARTS OF THE ABDOMEN, Divide the integuments from the sternum to the pelvis, from the crest of the ilium on each side to the umbilicus, also from this point upwards and outwards on each side over the cartilages of the ninth and tenth ribs, as high as midway between the axilla and the border of the thorax; dissect off the flaps; the sub- cutaneous cellular membrane will be found dense and strong, so as to have received the name of superficial fascia; this may be removed along with the integuments from the superior and lateral parts of the abdomen, but inferiorly and anteriorly it may be suffered to remain for further examination, a knowledge of its structure and connexions being of practical importance in the disease of hernia. The superficial fascia is continued from the surface of the thorax, over the abdominal muscles; weak and thin above, it increases in density as it descends; from the abdomen it extends on either side over Poupart’s ligament to the thigh, which it in- vests, and in the centre over the organs of generation : in the male a process of it passes round the spermatic cord on each side, descends into the scrotum, and is continuous with the ff^scia of the perinaeum, and from

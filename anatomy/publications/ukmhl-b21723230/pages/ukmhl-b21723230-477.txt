459 X 2 the fibula, on the anterior part of the head is a convex triangular surface looking forwards and downwards, . pierced with many vascular holes, and terminating in a tubercle, to the upper part of which a bursa adheres, and into the lowâ€™er the ligamentum patellae is inserted. The upper or femoral surface of the tibia presents two concave or articulating surfaces or condyles covered with cartilage, for articulating with the femur, the in- ternal is oval and the deeper of the two, it is also larger from before backwards ; the external is nearly circular, very superficial, and looks obliquely downwards and out- wards ; these are separated by a spine, which is of a py- ramidal form, inclines upwards and inwards and is sur- mounted by two tubercles ; it is nearer the back than the fore-part of the bone; a large flat depressed surface lies anterior to it and a smaller depression behind it; the semilunar cartilages and the crucial ligaments are inserted into these; the body of the tibia is triangular, its size diminishes from its head for about two-thirds dowTi, it then increases somewhat towards its lower end; its inner side is convex above and a little concave below, it is directed obliquely forwards, is covered su- periorly by the tendinous expansions of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus, but the remainder of it is subcutaneous ; the external side appears a little twisted, it is concave above to support the tibialis anticus mus- cle, but convex below to support the tendon of that muscle as also those of the extensors ; its posterior sur- face, which is also broader above than below, is slightly convex; it presents superiorly a prominent line passing obliquely downwards and outwards for the insertion of the poplitseus and the origin of the solaeus and the deep flexors; near this line is the opening of the large canal that leads the vessels to the medullary membrane, it slants obliquely dowmvards and forwards. The tibia presents three edges, one is anterior and very promi- nent about the middle, but less so above and rounded below, this line is subcutaneous, it is twisted like the tibia itself and is commonly called the crest or the shin, the inner edge is thick and round and more distinct below than above, the outer edge is thin and gives attachment to the interosseous ligament; it is less dis-

465 X 3 cuneiform bones, and is articulated to each of them; the outer side of its base is also joined to the third me^ tatarsal bone, its anterior extremity or head is round, and supports the second toe, it is marked internally and externally by the depressions for the lateral ligaments, a groov e separates the head from the body of the bone ; the 3rd metatarsal bone is a little shorter than the se- cond, but of the same form ; its base rests on the third cuneiform bone ; the 4th metatarsal bone is a little shorter, it rests on the cuboid bone, and the inner side of its base also rests against the third cuneiform bone; the 5th is the shortest except the first, it rests on the cuboid bone; the heads of all the metatarsal bones are round, the bases flat to articulate with the tarsus, the sides of their bases are also flat to join one another; all these bones possess a similar structure, and resemble the class of long bones. The Toes are five in number, the first or the great toe has only two phalanges, all the others have three ; there are therefore fourteen phalanges in all; the first pha- langes are longest, they are convex above, concave be- low ; their posterior end is larger, and presents a round concavity, for the head of the metatarsal bone, the an- terior end is convex from above dow'nwards and concave from side to side, so as to form a ginglymoid joint with the second phalanx. The second phalanges are very short, the great toe has none, the posterior end of each is concave from above dow'nwards, but convex trans- versely, being divided by a vertical ridge; the anterior extremity is similar to that of the first phalanx, its con- dyles are less prominent. The third phalanges are all very small except that of the great toe, they are of a pyramidal form, and support the nails, their posterior ex- tremity being ver)'large and similar to that of the middle phalanges, their anterior end is tubercular and attached to the cellule-vascular texture at the extremity of each; at the base of the first phalanx of the great toe there are in general two sesamoid bones into which the small muscles of this toe are inserted, frequently also there is another at the base of the second phalanx, sometimes one is found at the first joint of the second toe, and ano- ther at that of the fifth.

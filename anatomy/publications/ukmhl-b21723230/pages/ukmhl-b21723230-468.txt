450 The Nasal Bones are situated beneath the nasal pro- cess of the frontal and between the nasal processes of the superior maxillary bones, they are small, narrow, and thick above, thin and expanded below ; they form the bridge of the nose; the external surface of each is slightly concave from above downwards, convex from side to side and perforated with one or two small holes; the internal surface is concave and grooved for the nasal nerves; the superior margin is thick and deeply denticulated to join the nasal process and spine of the frontal and the nasal plate of the sethmoid bones; its external edge is grooved and received into the nasal process of the superior max- illaiy, its inner edge is flat to join with its fellow, and its lower edge is. thin and irregular, and joins the alar carti- lages of the nose, and is notched for the passage of the nasal branches of the ophthalmic nerve. The Vomer ; this azygos bone resembles a plough- share ; it stands in the median line, although it often bends a little to one side, is thin and flat and covered by the pituitary membrane, it presents four edges ; the upper or sphenoidal is hollowed to receive the azygos process ; the anterior is slightly grooved to receive the aethmoidal lamina and the nasal cartilage ; the posterior or pharyngeal is round and smooth and unattached ; the inferior or palatal edge is the longest, and is received between the laminae of the nasal crest of the maxillary and palate bones : it is attached to the maxillary, palate, aethmoid, and sphenoid bones, also to the turbinated bones of the latter; its structure is compact, but thin and transparent. The Inferior Maxillary Bone, or the lower jaw, is the largest of the' facial bones, it is of a semicircular figure situated at the lower part of the face, and extend- ing along its sides and back-part to the base of the skull; it is divided into the body or chin, the sides, the rami, and the processes ; the body is the anterior prominent portion with a vertical ridge in the centre, the symphi- sis, or the line of union of the two symmetrical pieces of which this bone in infancy consisted ; inferiorly the body projects into the mental process or chin, above this on each side is a depression for the muscles of the lower

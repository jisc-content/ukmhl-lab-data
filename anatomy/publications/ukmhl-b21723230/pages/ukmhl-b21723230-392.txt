371' at the intestine; near the latter each branch divides into two, which proceed in a direct course, one on the ante- rior, the other on the posterior surface of the intestine, and are distributed principally to the mucous mem- brane. The inferior mesenteric artery arises about two inches below the preceding; it descends towards the left iliac fossa and divides into three branches, left colic, sig- moid, and superior hsemorrhoidal; the left colic as- cends in the left mesocolon, anastomoses w'ith the mid- dle colic branch of the superior mesenteric, and sup- plies the left part of the colon ; the sigmoid artery is distributed to the sigmoid flexure of the colon ; the su- perior hcemorrhoidal descends along the back part of the rectum, supplies the coats of this intestine, and inos- \ culates with the middle and inferior hsemorhoidal ar- teries. The renal arteries arise from the sides of the aorta, between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries; the right is longer than the left; it passes across the spine behind the vena cava ; both pass behind their corres- ponding vein and divide near the kidney into five or six branches, which ramify through the substance of this gland. The capsular arteries are two or three in number; they arise either from the renal arteries or from the aorta; they supply the renal capsules. The spermatic arteries arise from the fore-part of the aorta ; the left frequently arises from the renal artery ; they are long and tortuous, descend obliquely outwards, crossing in front of the psoas muscle and the ureter ; in the male they accompany the vas deferens through the inguinal canal, and supply the testicle and epididymis ; in the female they pass to the ovarium, and also send branches to the fallopian tubes, and to the sides of the uterus. The lumbar arteries are four or five pair ; they arise from the back part of the aorta, pass obliquely outwards through the psoas, send branches between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, to the muscles of the back and loins, and terminate in the abdominal muscles.

332 external join the superior cervical nerves, and the ante- rior unite with branches of the vagus and the facial, and form a plexus around the carotid artery ; from this seve- ral branches extend along the external carotid, and form plexuses around each of its principal branches, which are named accordingly. The middle cervical ganglion is sometimes wanting; it is smaller than the superior, of a triangular, often of an irregular form; is situated be- hind the - carotid near the curt^e of the inferior thjToid artery, opposite the fifth vertebra, and upon the longus colli muscle ; it sends off branches in different directions which communicate with the cervical nerves and with the vagus : it also sends some filaments to join the cardiac nerves. The inferior cervical ganglion is of an irregu- lar figure ; it frequently appears to consist of several .small ganglions connected to each other by reddish fila- ments ; it is situated between the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib, behind and on either side of the vertebral arteiy% and be- tween the scalenus and longus colli muscles ; filaments from it communicate with the phrenic nerve and with the brachial plexus ; several also encircle the subclavian ar- tery and extend along that trunk and its several branches, particularly along the vertebral artery ; from it also the inferior cardiac nerves proceed. The student may next examine the cardiac nerves ; there are three on each side, they are named superior, middle, and inferior; the superior cardiac nerv^e, though very small, takes a long course ; it arises by two or three filaments from the su- perior cervical ganglion, descends along the side of the trachea behind the carotid artery to the chest; in this course it communicates with the laryngeal nerves, with the vagus, and with the inferior and middle ganglions of the sympathetic; there is sometimes a small ganglion upon it near the inferior thyroid artery; at the lower part of the neck it passes behind the subclavian vein and over the arteria innominata ; it here divides into several fila- ments ; some pass along the coats of that vessel to the aorta, others join the recurrent nerve and the middle and inferior cardiac nerves ; the superior cardiac nerv'e on the left side has a similar origin and course in the

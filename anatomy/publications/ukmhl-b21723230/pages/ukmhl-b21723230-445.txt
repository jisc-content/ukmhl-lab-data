427 THE HEAD. The Head stands at the upper extremity of the ver- tebral column, is of a spheroid figure, compressed on the sides; it contains the brain and the principal organs of sense, and is divided into the cranium and the face. The cranium or skull is of an oval figure, the narrow extremity before; it contains the brain, and is formed of eight bones, the frontal, two parietal, two temporal, the occipital, sphenoid and ethmoid; these bones are all closely united by sutures, in some of these are small bones called ossa triquetra or Wormii; the frontal is considered as common .the cranium and face, but the temporal, ethmoid, and sphenoid, are equally entitled to this distinction. The anterior region of the skull is named synciput or forehead; the posterior, occiput; the lateral, the temples; the upper part the vertex or bregma; and the lower, the base. The frontal, occi- pital, ethmoid and sphenoid bones occupy the median line, the others are lateral, and symmetrical, even the single bones are composed of parts perfectly similar on each side of the median line. The Frontal Bone at the upper and anterior part of the skull, forms the forehead, part of the temples, of the orbits and nose; it is of a semicircular form, con- vex and smooth anteriorly, concave posteriorly, and irregular below, it may be divided into the superior or frontal portion, and the inferior or orbital; the exter- nal surface of the frontal part presents in the median line, a longitudinal depression, in some not veiy dis- tinct, in others there is an elevation; this corresponds to the line of union, of the two pieces of which the bone when yoimg consisted, it is parallel to the longitudinal sinus internally, a suture frequently exists in it, parti- cularly below; at the lower part of this line is the nasal prominence longer in the old than in the young; the bone here is frequently very porous, it terminates in a rough edge for articulation with the nasal and superior maxillary bones; from the centre of it projects the nasal spine or process, which supports the nasal bones before, and the ethmoid bone behind, on each side of this is a groove which forms part of the superior nasal fossa?.

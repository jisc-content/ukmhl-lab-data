299 Optic Nerves : each optic nerve, on passing through the optic foramen, becomes surrounded by a strong sheath derived from the dura mater; the four recti muscles next surround it, from the fleshy portions of which it is sepa- rated by a considerable quantity of soft fat, in which se- veral nen'es and vessels are lodged; from the optic fora- men this nerve proceeds forwards and a little inwards, so as to be slightly curved, the convexity outwards ; at the back part of the eye it is very much constricted ; it then pierces the Sclerotic and choroid membranes and termi- nates in the retina.—(See Anatomy of the Eye.) The ophthalmic artery accompanies this nerve; in the optic foramen it lies beneath it, it afterwards twines around it to its internal side. In addition to the dura mater, this nerve possesses a very dense neurilema, which sends in numerous processes to form small canals or tubes in which the ner\’0U8 substance is contained, so that this nerve is not composed like other nerves, of several filaments placed parallel to each other; if the white substance be removed by maceration in an alkali, its cellular structure will be- come obvious. At the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, the fol- lowing four neires of the orbit lie according to their nu- merical order, viz. most superiorly the third pair, then the fourth, next the ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair, and most inferiorly the sixth or abducens nerve ; they are here closely united to each other, forming what may be termed the orbital plexus, until they arrive at the anterior clinoid process, where they separate, and as they are entering the foramen lacerum orbitale they lie thus : most superior is the fourth, then the frontal branch of ophthalmic, next the superior division of the third, external to which, and near to the outer wall of the orbit, is lachrymal nerve of the ophthalmic, after these the nasal nerve, below which is the inferior division of the third, and lastly lying inferior to them all, holding the same relation to them as at the cavernous sinus, is the sixth nerve. To expose these four nerves the orbit should be opened, which is to be done by dividing the orbital plate of the os frontis by two cuts with the saw,*

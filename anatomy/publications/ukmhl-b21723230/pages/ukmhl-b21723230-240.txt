222 soon uniting form a strong fleshy belly, which descends almost vertically, with a slight inclination inwards ; this muscle has a peculiar penniform appearance, it is also tendinous anteriorly in the upper half, so that the sar- torius can glide over it, and tendinous posteriorly in the lower half, whereby it can move on the surface of the crurseus. This muscle ends in a flat tendon, w'hich is inserted along with the vasti and cruraeus into the upper edge of the patella; a few fibres pass anterior to this bone, and are continued into the ligamentum patellae, which descends obliquely outwards to the tubercle of the tibia. Use, to extend the leg on the thigh, and to flex the thigh on the pelvis; it also supports and draws forwards the pelvis on the thigh, and strengthens the capsular ligament of the hip joint. The anterior ten- dinous origin of this muscle is covered by the sartorius, tensor vaginae and iliacus internus muscles, the poste- rior by the glutaeus medius and minimus muscles; the remainder of the muscle is only covered by the integu- ments and fascia; superiorly, this muscle lies on the capsular ligament of the hip joint and the external cir- cumflex vessels : in the rest of its course on the cru- raeus and vasti muscles, to which it is united below, so that some describe these four as one muscle, under the name of quadriceps extensor cruris. Beneath the rec- tus we find this large mass of muscular substance cover- ing the front and sides of the femur; it may be divided superiorly into three portions, but inferiorly these are inseparably united; the external portion is named vas- tus externus, the internal, vastus internus, and the mid- dle, cruraeus. Vastus Externus, much larger than the other portions, and larger above than below, arises from the root and anterior part of the great trochanter, anterior to the tendon of the glutaeus maximus. From the outer edge of the linea aspera, and from the oblique ridge which leads to the external condyle, anterior to the short head of the biceps; from all the external surface of the bone, and from the fascia lata, the fibres descend obliquely forwards ; the superior are very long, the in- ferior are shorter and more transverse, inserted into the external surface of the tendon of the rectus, also into

43 low, along the median line of the velum, and is inserted into the cellular tissue of the uvula. Use, to raise and shorten the uvula: this pair of muscles are so close that they appear but as one, hence they have sometimes re- ceived the name of azygos iivulce. Palato-Glossus vel constrictor isthmi faucium, or the anterior arch or pillar of the palate, arises from the inferior surface of the velum, descends forwards and outwards, enclosed in a fold of mucous membrane an- terior to the tonsil. Inserted into the side of the tongue. Use, to elevate the tongue or to depress the velum, this pair of muscles may close the fauces. Palato-Piiaryngeus, or posterior arch of the pa- late, arises broad from the inferior surface of the palate, arches downwards and backwards behind the tonsil, and is inserted into the side and back of the pharynx, and into the comu of the thyroid cartilage, its fibres mixing with those of the stylo-pharyngeus. Use, to elevate the pharynx, like the stylo-pharyngei in the commencement of deglutition ; but afterwards to depress the velum. The tonsil or amygdala is a congeries of mucous glands, of an irregular figure, somewhat oval, the larger extremity above, placed in a triangular recess between the pillars of the palate, above the side of the base of the tongue, covered internally by the mucous mem- brane, externally by the superior constrictor; small holes are remarked on its surface; these lead into cells from which the mucus can be expressed; the amygdalae are very vascular and secrete a viscid fluid, which being pressed out in the moment of deglutition by the contrac- tion of the surrounding muscles, serves to lubricate the alimentarj' bolus in its passage. The cesophagus appears as the continuation of the pharA'nx, it differs from it however in structure; the mucous membrane is paler ; the muscular fibres are ar- ranged in two laminae, the external are longitudinal, strong and red, attached superiorly and anteriorly to the cricoid cartilage, and below are lost on the sto- niach ; the internal circular fibres are pale, and cease abruptly at the cardiac orifice of the stomach. In the neck the oesophagus descends posterior to the trachea, ^ 1 middle line; it inclines a little to the left side below, so as to be uncovered by that tube;

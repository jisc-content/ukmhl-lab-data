46 to the epiglottis by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, which folds form the sides of the glottis, and inferiorly to the angle of the thyroid by two ligaments on each side, called thyro-arytenoid, or chorda: vocales; these arise from a sharp projection on the fore part of the base of each arj'tenoid, pass forwards converging, and are inserted into the angle of the thyroid; the inferior is tendinous and horizontal, the superior membranous and semilunar; the narrow pas- sage between these ligaments of opposite sides is called the rima glottidis; between the superior and inferior ligament of each side is a semilunar fossa called the sinus or ventricle of the larynx. The epi- glottis, or fibro-cartilage, is anterior to the glottis; it is somewhat of an oval form, connected inferiorly by a stalk-like process to the angle of the thyroid ; anteriorly by cellular membrane and by the epiglottidean gland to the os hyoides, also to the tongue by three folds of mu- cous membrane, the central one of which is called the fraennm epiglottidis; posteriorly to the arytenoid car- tilages by the folds of mucous membrane, which form the sides of the glottis. The epiglottis stands nearly vertical; it is a little curved forwards at its upper bor- der and along its sides, so that its anterior surface is concave from above downwards, and convex trans- versely ; and its posterior surface is concave from side to side, and convex from above downwards; it is verj- elastic, and never found ossified, a change which the cartilages of the larynx are prone to undergo: in de- glutition the epiglottis is of much use; it covers the larynx, and so prevents any foreign substance entering it: during this act the tongue is turned backwards, and the larynx raised forwards; thus the glottis is closed, and the contents of the mouth pass over the epiglottis into the pharynx. The larynx is lined by mucous membrane, which passing from the tongue and pharynx, covers the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages, forms their connecting folds, descends into the laiynx, covers the chordae vocales, lines the ventricles of the lar)mx. and is continued down through the trachea and the branches of that tube; it is but loosely connected to the cartilages above at the glottis, but more closely below; several mucous glands are connected to it, thus in the

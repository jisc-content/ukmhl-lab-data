379 thigh it gives several branches to the gemelli, quadratus, glutaeiis maximus, and the hamstrings, and inosculates with the external circumflex and sciatic arteries ; the first or superior perforating artery passes backwards beneath the lesser trochanter, between the pectinaeus and adductor brevis, and through the adductor magnus, its branches are distributed to the latter and to the ham- strings ; the second or middle perforating artery, larger than the first, passes through the adductor brevis and magnus, and spreads its branches among the muscles on the back of the thigh ; the third ov inferior perforating artery descends behind the adductor longus, and through the magnus to the hamstrings ; on the back part of the thigh the profunda ends in two branches, one passes to the biceps, the other to the semi-membranosus. After the origin of the profunda, the femoral gives off several small muscular and cutaneous twigs, and near the opening in the triceps, through which it passes, it gives off, 3rd, the anastomotica magna ; this descends in front of the adtjuctor tendon to the knee, sends several branches to the integuments, vastus internus, and to the patella ; these inosculate with the long branches of the external circumflex artery above, and with the articular arteries below. The poplitceal artery descends from the inner side of the femur, obliquely outwards to the inferior and central part of the popliteal space ; it is covered by the skin and fascia, and overlapped superiorly by the semi-membra- nosus, and inferiorly by the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles ; the popliteal vein lies superficial and external to it ; the sciatic neiwe is still more superficial and ex- ternal ; its branches are, 1st, several muscular branches to the hamstrings and to the gastrocnemius ; 2nd, supe- rior articular, encircle the lower extremity of the femur, turn round the sides, to the fore-part of the joint, and communicate with the anastomotica and with branches of the external circumflex ; 3rd, azygos-articular, passes forwards through the posterior ligament of the joint, and supplies the synovial membrane and the adipose substance in its cavity ; 4th, inferior articular arteries, encircle the lower part of the joint; the internal passes round the

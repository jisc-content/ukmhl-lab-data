384 vertebroe and of the aorta, receiping the intercostal veins from each side, also the oesophageal and bronchial; at the fourth vertebra it curves forwards round the root of the right lung, an'd opens into the back part of the vena cava. The veins of the lower extremity are superficial and deep ; the former, the internal and external saphena; the external passes from the dorsum of the foot behind the external malleolus, ascends along the back of the leg to the ham, and joins the popliteal vein ; the internal saphena commences on the upper and inner part of the foot, ascends in front of the inner ankle along the inner side of the leg, and behind the internal condyle of the knee ; it then inclines to the internal and anterior part of the thigh, and ascends to within about two inches of Poupartâ€™s ligament, it then passes through the saphenic opening in the fascia lata and joins the femoral vein; the deep veins of the leg accompany the arteries, two with each, they terminate in the popliteal vein, which ascends superficial and external to the artery ; this vein then receives the name of femoral, and is closely con- nected to the artery, lying posterior to it below, and on its inner side above ; this then passes behind the crural arch and becomes the external iliac, which lies internal and rather posterior to the accompanying artery ; op- posite the ilio-sacral symphysis this- is joined by the internal iliac vein, which arises from the union of the several veins that accompanied the branches of the internal iliac artery ; the union of the external and internal iliac veins constitute the common iliac which ascends on each side towards the right side of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and unite to form the inferior vena cava ; the left common iliac vein is longer than the right, and runs obliquely across the spine ; both are posterior to the corresponding arteries. The inferior vena cdva ascends along the right side of the lumbar vertebrae, on the psoas and left crus of the diaphragm, to the liver, passes through a groove in this organ be- tween the right and middle lobes, and then through the large quadrangular opening in the tendon of the diaphragm, perforates the pericardium, and opens into

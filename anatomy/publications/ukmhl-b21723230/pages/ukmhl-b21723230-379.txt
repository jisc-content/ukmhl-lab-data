S61 branch that pasaes through the foramen lacerum pos- terius, and supplies the dura mater at the base of the cranium. i The transverse artery of the face arises from the carotid in the parotid gland, accompanies the duct of Steno, and is distributed to the muscles and integu- ments of the face, and joins the branches of the facial arterj'. The temporal artery ascends through the parotid gland between the meatus auditorius and the articu- lation of the maxilla, behind the zygoma, and divides on the temporal fascia into an anterior and posterior branch; it gives off, 1st, branches to the gland: 2nd, anterior auricular; 3rd, ihe'middle temporal; this pierces the fascia and is distributed to the tem- poral muscle; 4th, the anterior or frontal supplies the skin and muscles of the forehead, and joins the ascending branches of the ophthalmic artery; 5th, posterior temporal bends backwards and upwards in the scalp and inosculates with the occipital and auricular ar- teries. The internal maxillary artery ascends obliquely fonvards behind the neck of the maxilla, between the pterjâ€™goid muscles, then between the external pter)'- goid and the temporal muscle, it then bends down into the pterygo-maxillary fossa; it gives off" the fol- lowing branches, 1st, while internal to the neck of the maxilla, the middle artery of the dura mater ; this ascends to the base of the cranium, passes through the spinous hole of the sphenoid bone, then runs outwards and forwards, and again ascends along the great wing of the sphenoid bone to the inferior angle of the parietal, which bone it grooves very deeply; it then ascends between this bone and the dura mater, divides into several branches, which ascend obliquely backwards, and are lost in the bone and the dura mster; 2nd, the inferior dental arises opposite the last, de- scends obliquely forwards between the bone and the internal lateral ligament, enters the dental foramen, and proceeds beneath the teeth, to the roots of w'hich it sends very small arteries, and through the mental hole it sends a small branch to the muscles and mu- R

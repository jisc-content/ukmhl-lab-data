280 where they enter into the lateral ventricles, touching each other internally, where they are soft and grey ; this connexion is termed the commissura mollis, it is a broad, soft, and cineritious union between the internal surfaces of the thalami, and anterior to their centre, this must be broken through before the third ventricle can be seen; a sort of fissure separates the thalami; this fissure anteriorly leads to the foramen commune anteriua, and posteriorly to foramen communeposte- rius: this last hole is behind the soft commissure, and between the peduncles of the pineal gland; it is, how- ever, so closed by the velum and the fornix, that no communication can occur through it betw'een the third and the two lateral ventricles, as through the anterior common opening; the optic thalami externally and inferiorly are continuous with the corpora striata and the medullary substance of the hemispheres; inferiorly they present two tubercles {corpus geniculatam inter- num and externum ;) their anterior extremity is in the foramen commune anterius, their posterior is in contact with the corpus fimbriatum ; the upper surface of each is in the body of the lateral ventricle, the inferior sur- face is in the inferior cornu; through the substance of the thalami some portions of the crura cerebri pass in their course to the convolutions of the hemispheres, hence they are named by some the inferior ganglions of the brain. Separate the optic thalami, and the third or middle ventricle will be opened. The third ventricle is a narrow cavity placed in the median line, bounded on each side by the optic thalami, above by the velum and the fornix, below by the locus perforatus and tuber cinereum, before by the descending pillars of the for- nix and the anterior commissure, behind by the pos- terior commissure and pineal gland, its pedimculi and the tubercula quadrigemina. The foramen commune anterius opens into the upper and anterior part of this cavity; the infundibulum leads from the lower and an- terior part downwards and forwards, between the pillars of the fornix and below the anterior commissure, to the pituitary gland; this canal is large above, but it is ge- nerally impervious below.

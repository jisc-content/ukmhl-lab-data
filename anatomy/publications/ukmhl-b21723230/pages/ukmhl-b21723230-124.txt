106 gament; it arises and descends at first between the pro- nator teres and palmaris longus, afterwards between this latter and the supinator longus, from which it is sepa- rated by the radial nerve and vessels : the radial edge of this tendon may serve as a guide, in cutting down on the radial artery in the living subject. Palmaris Longus arises by a slender tendon from the inner condyle, and from the fascia of the forearm ; forms a short belly, which ends in a flat tendon; in- serted near the root of the thumb into the annular liga- ment and palmar aponeurosis. Use, to bend the hand and make tense the palmar fascia; it descends between the flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris, and lies on the flexor sublimis : it is sometimes wanting. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, arwes tendinous from the internal condyle, tendinous and fleshy from the inner side of the olecranon process; the ulnar nerve separates these origins; it also arises by a tendinous expansiojj from the inner edge of the ulna nearly its whole length, and from the fascia of the forearm, the fibres pass ob- liquely forwards to a tendon which descends in front of the ulna, and which overlaps the ulnar nerve and vessels, and is inserted into the pisiform bone, and by a few liga- mentous fibres into the base of the fifth metacarpal bone; this insertion is also connected to the muscles of the little finger. Use, to flex the hand, and adduct it, particularly when assisted by the extensor carpi ulnaris: adduction of the hand, is not so limited as abduction, inconse- quence of thjp ulna being shorter below than the radius. This muscle is superficial, and lies internal and rather posterior to the preceding muscles; it descends between the flexor sublimis and* extensor carpi ulnaris, and lies upon the flexor profundus; the tendon passes over the annular ligament, and is connected to it by a tendi- nous slip, which also passes over the ulnar artery and nerve. Flexor Digitorum Sublimis Perforatus, arises tendinous and fleshy from the internal condyle and internal lateral ligament; tendinous from the coro- noid process, and fleshy from the radius below its tuber- cle, internal to the pronator teres, and between the su- pinator brevis and flexor pollicis longus; it forms a large

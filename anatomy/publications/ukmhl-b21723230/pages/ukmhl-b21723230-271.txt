253 nous fibres ; becomes broad and fleshy, and is inserted into a flat triangular surface, â– which occupies the su- perior.fifth of the posterior surface of the tibia. Use, to bend the knee, and when bent, to twist the foot and toes inwards; it may also assist when the limb is extended in rotating the knee outwards ; it supports the external semilunar cartilage, and moves it slightly, so as to adapt its situation to the external condyle of the femnr, in the rotatory motions of the joint ; the poplitaeus is covered by the gastrocnemius and plantaris, also by the external lateral ligament, the popliteal nerve and vessels : it is superior to the solaeus, and passes over the tibia-fibular articulation and the back part of the tibia ; it is nearly parallel to the upper part of the plan- taris ; the tendon is nearly surrounded by the synovial membrane of the knee; it lies, however, external to the cavity of the joint. Flexor Digitorum Perforans, broader in the centre than at either end, arises fleshy from the poste- rior flat surface of the tibia, commencing belorv the poplitaeus, and extending to within two or three inches of the ankle, also from the fascia and intermuscular septa ; the fibres descend obliquely inwards to a tendon which passes behind the internal malleolus, in a groove in the tibia which is lubricated by a bursa, and in which it is confined along with the tendon of the tibialis pos- ticus by the internal annular ligament, separated, how- ever, from that tendon by a ligamentous septum; each tendon also has a distinct synovial sac : this tendon then turns forwards and a little outwards into the sole of the foot, still confined in a bony groove, first in the astragalus and then in the os calcis ; in the sole of the foot it lies beneath the tendon of the flexor pollicis, and is connected to it by a tendinous slip ; about the centre of this region it expands and receives the insertion of the accessory muscle, it then divides into four tendons, which pass to the four outer toes, and opposite the first phalan.x, each tendon enters a strong fibrous sheath which is lined by synovial membrane ; this sheath con- tinues as far as the extremity of the second phalanx, and contains also*.the corresponding tendon of the flexor digitorum brfevis ; opposite the base of the second

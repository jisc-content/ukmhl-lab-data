267 rates the hemispheres of the. cerebellum ; this process serves to retain the tentorium and falx cerebri in a state of tension. Attached to the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone on each side, is a slight fold of dura mater, termed the sphenoidal fold ; these serve to increase the surface of the anterior fossae of the base of the cranium, and cor- respond to the fissures of Sylvius at the base of the brain. The uses of the dura mater are, first to serve as a perios- teum ; second, to cover the brain; third, by its processes to separate and support the different parts of this organ; fourth, to form sheaths for several of the nerves as they leave the cranium ; and fifth, to form the sinuses which may be next examined. The sinuses correspond to the veins, or in fact they are veins enclosed between the laminae of the dura mater, which thus retain them in their situation, and enable them to resist distention ; the sinuses are, the' superior and inferior longitudinal, the straight, the right and left lateral, the superior and inferior petrous, the right and left cavernous, the circular, the transverse, the occipital and the torcular Herophili. The superior longitudinal sinus commences at the crista galli, either in a small cul de sac, or by a small vein from the nose ; it extends up- wards and backwards along the median line, increasing- in size, and opposite the tubercle of the os occipitis it di- vides into the right and left lateral sinuses, the right brahch being in general the larger; with the scissors lay open this sinus through its whole length; it appears somewhat triangular, lined by a smooth fine membrane, which is continuous with that lining the venous system ; in general it is usually dilated near the vertex; small white fibrous bands cross it in many places ; these have an imperfect resemblance to the valves of veins, and may serve to resist distention of the sinus ; they have been named cotcUb Willisii; about the middle of this sinus there are in general a number of small whitish bodies, sometimes lying singly, but more frequently in clusters, near the openings of some of the veins in the sinus, these are termed glandulce Pacchioni ; their size, number and appearance, differ considerably in different subjects ; in the very young there are few, if any ; in the old, they n2

3S9 SECTION II. ORGAN OF TASTE. The organ of taste resides in the mucous membrane Â©f the tongue; this membrane is spread over the muscu- lar substance of the tongue, adheres closely to it, and presents a number of projections or papillae ; the tongue is verj' vascular and is supplied with six nerves ; the gus- tatory is distributed anteriorly and chiefly to the papillae, the lingual to the inferior surface and to its muscular substance, the glosso-pharyngeal to the muscular sub- stance and mucous membrane at its base ; experiments have proved that the fifth nerve endows this organ with its peculiar sense, that of taste ; and that the lingual or ninth is its motor nerve ; the glosso-pharyngeal is pro- bably for the purpose of connecting the tongue in sym- pathy with the stomach and the respiratory organs : the form of the tongue has been already described, (see page 36.) SECTION III. ANATOMY OF THE EAR. The parts composing this complicated organ may be divided into three classesthe 1st concludes the exter- nal ear, or the cartilages and meatus extemus ; the 2d the tympanum with the Eustachian tube, ossicula au- ditus and mastoid cells ; the 3d the labyrinth or inter- nal ear, which includes the vestibule, semi-circular canals, cochlea, and meatus internus with the portio mollis. The external ear consists of the pinna or auricle and the meatus extemus ; the pinna is composed of a thin fibro-cartilaginous plate, curved in different directions, so as to present different eminences and depressions ; the convex edge which forms the outline of it is the helix, below this is a short semicircular fold, the anti- helix, this divides superiorly into two crura ; the de- Q 2

20G is continued from that covering the prostate gland. Each vesicula consists of two tunics, viz. mucous membrane internally, and peculiar grey substance externally, some- what similar to, but softer than the outer coat of the vas deferens. The vas deferens communicates more freely with the corresponding vesicula than the latter does with the former, hence air or fluid injected into the vas defe- rens will generally distend the vesicula seminales of the same side before it escapes into the urethra. These or- gans are generally believed to contribute some additional secretion to the seminal fluid, rather than to ser\'e as reser- voirs for the latter ; their exact use, however, is not well known.; they are wanting in many animals. The Pros- tate gland is situated at the anterior and inferior part of the pelvis behind the triangular ligament, in front of the rectum, to which it is connected by cellular membrane; it surrounds the neck of the bladder, and is attached by the anterior ligaments of this organ to the lower edge of the symphysis pubis, from which it is about three-fourths of an inch distant. The prostate gland is somewhat heart-shaped, or triangular ; it is also compared to a chesnut; the base or larger extremity is posterior, and connected to the vesiculae seminales ; the apex is ante- rior, and extends within a short distance of the trian- gular ligament; the neck of the bladder, and about an inch of the urethra, run through its substance, but a small portion of it lies superior to the neck of the blad- der and urethra ; this part is convex, and is covered by the dorsal veins of the penis, and by the anterior liga- ments,of the bladder; the inferior or posterior surface of the gland is almost flat, a slight groove is generally observable on it, extending along the mesial line; this surface is attached to the fore-part of the rectum, and may be felt distinctly either in the living or in the dead subject by the finger introduced into the intestine about two inches and a half above the anus ; the sides of the ffland are smooth and round, and are covered bv a strong fascia, by several veins, and by the levatores aui muscles. In the base or posterior end is a notch for the entrance of the common ejaculatory ducts ; this notch,, together with the groove on the posterior sm-

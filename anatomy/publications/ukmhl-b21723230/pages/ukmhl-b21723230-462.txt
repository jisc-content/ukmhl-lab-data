the sides by the squamous portions of the temporal, and behind by the superior angles of the petrous portions of the same bone, and by the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid; in the middle is the sella turcica, on each side of which, but below it, is a groove for the carotid artery, and for the cavernous sinus, and below this is a shallow groove for the superior maxillary nerve ; further out on each side, are the cavities to lodge the middle lobes of the brain; and on the anterior surface of the petrous bones are sdfen the juttings of the vertical semi- ' circular canals. The foramina in this division are, the foramina lacera orbitaria superiora, rotunda, ovalia, ca- rotica, spinosa, lacera basis cranii anteriora, and inno- minata or hiatus Fallopii. The 3rd or occipital portion is bounded before by the basilar process,, and by the pos- terior surface of the petrous bones, and behind by the occipital, it presents the basilar process, the foramen magnum, the perpendicular ridge of the occipital crossed by the transverse, by which this bone is divided into four fossae, the superior angles of the petrous bones having a shallow groove for the superior petrosal sinuses, the transverse occipital ridge, with a deep one for the lateral sinuses, which last are continued over the infe- rior angles of the parietal bones, and thence descend in- wards along the mastoid portions of the temporal bone, and then again groove the occipital bone, and pass for- Avards on it to the posterior foramina lacera ; the perpen- dicular ridge is grooved above for the longitudinal sinus, which terminates sometimes in the left, and at other times in the right lateral sinus; the same ridge below the tentorium gives attachment to the falx minor, and is slightly grooved for the occipital sinuses. The foramina in this division are the foramina audith^a, aqueductus vestibulorum, foramina lacera postica, foramen magnum, foramina condyloidea antica and postica. THE BONES OF THE F.\CE. These consist of six pair and two single bones; the six pair are the malar, superior ma.xillar}', lachrymal, nasal, palatine, and inferior spongy: the two single bones are the vomer and the inferior ma.xillary.

464< the calcaneum, anteriorly it presents two articular sur- faces, the internal is square and supports the fourth me- tatarsal bone, the external is triangular and supports the fifth ; the external side is narrow, the internal is rough posteriorly, but presents anteriorly two articulating sur- faces, the posterior for the scaphoid, and the anterior for the external cuneiform bone; the cuboid is articu- lated with the calcaneum, the scaphoid, the external cu- neiform, and the two external metatarsal bones. The Cuneiform Bones; these three wedge-shaped bones are situated at tire anterior part of the tarsus, be- tween the scaphoid and the three internal metatarsal bones ; the first or the internal is the largest of the three, its base is below and its long axis is from above down- wards, it is articulated posteriorly to the scaphoid bone, anteriorly to the first, and externally to the second meta- tarsal bone, and to the middle cuneiform, inferiorly it presents a tubercle for the insertion of the tibialis anti- cus, and for a portion of the tendon of the tibialis posti- cus ; the middle cuneiform is the smallest, and is wedged in between the two others; it is also articulated behind to the scaphoid and before to the second meta- tarsal bone ; the 3rd or external cuneiform bone is si- tuated between the last and the cuboid bone, it is articu- lated anteriorly with the third metatarsal bone ; poste- riorly w'ith the scaphoid, internally with the middle cuneiform and with the second metatarsal bone, and ex- ternally W'ith the cuboid, and with the fourth metatarsal bone. All the bones of the tarsus are composed of a soft spongy vascular tissue covered by a compact, but thin lamina ; they are each developed from one point of ossi- fication, except the calcaneum and the astragalus, which commeftce each in tw'o points. The Metatarsal Bones are five in number, the 1st or internal is the shortest and thickest, convex above, concave and sharp below, its posterior end is oval, con- cave, and rests on the internal cuneiform bone, the an- terior end round and smooth, supports the first or great toe, this extremity is grooved below, and lodges the sesamoid bones, the peronaeus longus is also in- serted into it; the 2nd is the longest of the metatarsal bones, its tarsal end is wedged in between the three

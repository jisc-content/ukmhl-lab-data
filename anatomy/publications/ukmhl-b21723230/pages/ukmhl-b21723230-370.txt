352 teiior to the vitreous humour, and the internal is loose, and forms the circumference of the posterior chamber of the eye. The Iris is a delicate circular membrane, floating in the aqueous humour and suspended vertically be- hind the cornea, so as to divide the space between this and the lens into two chambers, an anterior and a posterior, the former is the larger of the two; these chambers communicate through the central aperture in the iris, the Pupil: this aperture is a little nearer its nasal than its temporal side; the external border of the iris is fixed to the ciliaiy ligament, its posterior surface is also in part attached to the same and to the ciliar}' processes; this surface is covered by pigment, and is named uvea; the anterior surface is covered by the fine membrane of the aqueous humour, and streaked with diftâ€™erent coloured lines, some of which take a ra- diated course from the circumference towards the pu- pil, near which they cross, dmde, and unite again, and appear to form or to end in a fasciculus of'circular fibres, which bound the pupil, and w'hich are of a darker tint. The iris, w'hen examined with a magnify- ing glass, has a villous appearance ; w'hen the pigment is washed off the posterior surface, the fibrous structure is evident there also, and bristles may even be passed beneath some of the fasciculi; the iris is supplied with numerous arteries and nerves; the former are branches of the long and anterior ciliary, the latter are derived from the lenticular ganglion, and from the nasal nerve ; it is not generally agreed on w'hether the fibrous ap- pearance of the iris depends on the peculiar arrange- ment of its vessels and nerves, or whether it possesses a true muscular structure ; its functions may lead one to incline to the latter opinion, as the pupil has the power of contracting rapidly when a strong light approaches the eye, and of again dilating Avhen the light is w^eak ; the use, therefore, of the his is to regulate the quantity of light which is to enter the eye. The pupil is closed in the foetus by a delicate but vascular membrane, the mcmbrdna pupillaris; this membrane is ruptured either at, or a short time previous to birth.

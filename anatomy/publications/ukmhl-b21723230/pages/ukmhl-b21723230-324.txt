306 branch also passes through the malar bone into the temporal fossa, pierces the temporal fascia, becomes cutaneous, and joining some branches of the facial nerve, it accompanies the temporal artery, and is lost in the integuments of the temple and head.V The su- perior maxillary nerve next gives off the posterior dental nerves; these are two or three branches which wind round the tuberosity of the maxillary bone, enter small foramina, which lead to the posterior alveoli in this bone, and supply the molar teeth; some branches also supply the gums and the buccinator muscle. As the infra-orbital nerve, which is the last branch of the su- perior maxillary, proceeds along the floor of the orbit, it sends off some small filaments to the fat and muscles in this region, also the anterior dental; this descends along the fore-part of the antrum, to the lining mem- brane, of which it gives some fine filaments, and is then lost in several branches which supply the canine and incisor teeth: the infra-orbital nerve then escapes through the foramen of the same name beneath the orbi- cularis palpebrarum and levator labii superioris alseque nasi muscles; it here divides into several branches Avhich are distributed to the face, some of these ascend to the palbebrse, others pass outwards to the cheek, and the largest branches descend to the ala nasi and to the upper lip ; these different branches have frequent com- munications on the side of the face wdth the portio dura, on the nose with the nasal nerves, and on the buccina- tor muscle they form a plexus with each other, and with the buccal and facial nerves. The Inferior Maxillary Nerve; this, which is the third and largest branch of the fifth pair, im- mediately passes from the ganglion through the fora- men ovale into the zygomatic fossa behind the exter- nal pteiy^goid muscle, where it divides into two large branches, a superior or external, and an inferior or internal. The inferior maxillary neiwe consists of two portions, one is plexiform, and proceeds from the gas- serian ganglion, the other is concealed by this, and consists of white parallel fibres which do not pass through the ganglion; in the zygomatic fossa this small deep portion winds round the other, becomes

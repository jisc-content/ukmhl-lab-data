87 dorsi, multifidus spinfe, inter-spinalis, inter-transversales, and immediately below the occiput, of the recti postici, major and minor, and obliqui capitis, superior and infe- rior. Spinalis Colli, arises from the extremity of the transverse processes of five or six superior dorsal verte- brae, ascends obliquely inwards, and is inserted by four heads into the spinous process of the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th cervical vertebrae. Use, to extend the neck and incline it a little to its own side: this thick muscle fills up the space between the spinous and transverse pro- cesses of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae; it lies ex- ternal to the semi-spinalis dorsi, is overlapped by the longissimus dorsi interiorly, the complexus superiorly, and the serratus posticus superior in the middle. Semi-Spinali3 Dorsi is similar to the last muscle in form and attachment; indeed they appear as one long muscle, which has been thus rather unnecessarily divided into two, each named from the situation of its principal portion ; it arises by five or six tendons from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, from the 5th to the 11th; its fibres ascend obliquely in- wards, and are inserted by five or six tendons into the extremity of two inferior cervical, and three or four superior dorsal vertebrae. Use, co-operates with the last described muscle, in extending the neck, support- ing the trunk, and inclining the spine backwards, and to one side : it is situated close to the spine above, and internal to the last muscle: but below, it lies on the outer side of the spinalis dorsi. Multifidus Spin;Â® is close to the vertebrae, be- tween the spinous and transverse processes, and is covered by the two last described muscles; it consists of a series of small tendinous and fleshy fasciculi; the first arises from the spine of the dentatus, or 2d ver- tebra, and descending obliquely outwards, is inserted into the transverse process of the 3d : thus the succeed- ing muscles are attached, running obliquely from ver- tebra to vertebra between their spinous and transverse processes; some fasciculi extend over two or three vertebrae; the last arises from the spine of the last lumbar vertebra, and is inserted into the false transverse

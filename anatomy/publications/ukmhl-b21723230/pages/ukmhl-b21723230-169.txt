151 The viscera of the abdomen are the digestive and uri- nary organs; the former we shall examine first; they may be divided into the membranous and glandular. The membranous viscera are the stomach and intestinal tube ; the latter is divided into the small and large intestine ; the small intestine is subdivided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum ; the large intestine into the caecum, colon, and rectum. Tlie glandular viscera are the liver, spleen, and pancreas. We shall consider the membranous viscera first, and commence with the description of the stomach, which is the most important part of the digestive appa- ratus, the principal change in the food being accomplished in this organ. The stomach is placed between the oesophagus and the duodenum, and communicates with both ; it is situated in the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions, and a small portion of it extends into the right hypochondrium : from the left side it passes across the epigastric region, ob- liquely downwards and forw^ards, and near its right or pyloric extremity it bends a little upwards and backwards. The stomach is connected to the diaphragm by the oeso- phagus and by the peritonaeum; to the spleen by the sple- nic omentum ; to the liver by the lesser omentum, and to the arch of the colon by the great omentum. If the sto- mach be moderately distended with air or fluid, its form and connexions can be better understood; it will then ap- pear somewhat of a conical figure, the base to the left side, the apex to the right, the intermediate part being somewhat curved ; it will present two extremities, the left and right; two orifices, the cardiac and pyloric ; two sur- faces, an anterior or superior, a posterior or inferior ; and two curvatures or edges, the lesser or concave, the greater or convex. The left or splenic extremity is very large, swells into the left hypochondrium beneath the ribs, so as nearly to conceal the spleen ; the right or pyloric ex- tremity is much smaller, is cylindrical and slightly con- voluted like an intestine; it lies anterior and inferior to the left or splenic end, and e.xtends to the fundus of the gall bladder or to the edge of the lobulus quadratus of the liver; it sometimes descends into the umbilical region. The cardiac orifice is the highest point of the stomach ;

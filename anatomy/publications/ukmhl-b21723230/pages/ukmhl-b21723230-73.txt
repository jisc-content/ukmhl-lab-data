55 and subclavian muscle, from which it passes downwards and outwards to the coracoid process, arching across the great vessels, and is then connected to that process, and to the tendon of the lesser pectoral: this fascia is called by some the coraco-clavicular ligament; it is sometimes very strong, and from the manner in which it is extended over the vessels, it renders it difficult to feel the pulsation of the axillary artery below the cla- vicle. Serratus Magnus, thin and broad, particularly anteriorly, placed behind the pectoral muscles and the ^ axillary vessels, and between the scapula and the ribs, arises by eight or nine fleshy slips, from the eight or nine superior ribs; the fibres ascend obliquely back- wards, and are inserted between the subscapular, the rhomboid and levator anguli muscles into the base of the scapula, but particularly into the superior and inferior angles. Use, to draw the scapula forwards, particu- larly the inferior angle, and thus, by rotating this bone on its axis, to raise the acromion process and the shoulder joint; when the upper extremity is fixed, this muscle can raise and draw outwards the ribs, so as to assist in inspiration.â€”^The serratus magnus lies on the ribs and intercostal muscles; also on a portion of the serratus posticus; external to it are the axillary ves- sels, the scapula and subscapular muscle; the trapezius, latissimus dorsi and rhomboid muscles lie behind it, and the pectoral muscles are anterior to it; an abundance of loose cellular membrane connected to its surface al- lows it to glide on the ribs, and also facilitates the movements of the scapula upon it. The four superior digitations lie behind those of the lesser pectoral, and the four inferior, which are only covered by the skin, indigitate with the origins of the external oblique. If the clavicle be separated from the sternum, and the sca- pula pulled from the side, this muscle will then become tense, and in this state it appears to consist of three portions, which differ in structure and in form ; the su- perior is a thick, short and strong fasciculus, somewhat ^uare, passing from the two first ribs beneath the ax- illary vessels and brachial plexus, to the superior angle of the scapula; its flat surface is directed upwards, and

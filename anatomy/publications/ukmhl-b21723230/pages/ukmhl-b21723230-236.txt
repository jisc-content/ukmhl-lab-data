218 three or four in number; the deep-seated absorljents of the limb pass through these. The integuments and superficial fascia having been removed, the fascia lata may be next examined. This aponeurosis surrounds the thigh; it is very strong and tendinous external!)', but so thin and weak internally, that without caution it is apt to be removed along with the integuments; it is attached superiorly and externally to the crest of the ilium; posteriorly to the sacrum and coccyx: on the glutaeus maximus it is very weak and thin, but at the anterior border of this muscle it becomes verj' strong, receiving an addition of fibres, both from the tendon of that muscle, and from the tensor vaginas femoris; an- teriorly the fascia lata is attached to Poupart’s li- gament, and internally to the rami of the ischium and pubis; as this aponeurosis extends down the thigh, it confines the different muscles in their situation, so as to preseiwe the figure of the limb; several pro- cesses also pass in from its internal surface to form sheaths for some muscles, and to bind down others in their place ; to many of these processes the muscles ad- here, so that when in action they serve to make the fascia more tense and resisting; these processes also servo to increase the surface of origin or attachment of several muscles. Along the posterior part of the thigh the fascia lata is connected to the whole length of the linea aspera, also to the insertion of the glutaeus maxi- mus, and to the origin of the short head of the biceps ; inferiorly it adheres to the condyles of the femur, sur- rounds the knee-joint, and receives an addition of fibres from the different tendons in this region; below the knee it is continued over the heads of the tibia and fibula into the fascia of the leg. Numerous foramina are observable in the fascia lata, particularly at the upper and anterior part of the thigh ; they transmit cutaneous nerves and vessels : the most remarkable of these holes is that for the saphena vein; it is situated about an inch and a half below Poupart’s ligament, and may be most distinctly seen by dividing the vein on the fore-part of the thigh, and raising it towards the abdomen; this opening is semilunar, the concavity directed upwards; from its apparently sharp edge the fascia is reflected

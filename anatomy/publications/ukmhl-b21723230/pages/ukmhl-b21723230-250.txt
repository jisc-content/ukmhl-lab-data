232 surface of this fascia, from the three anterior fourths of the crest of the ilium, from the superior semicircular line or ridge which leads from the anterior spinous process of the ilium to the upper part of the sciatic notch, and from the surface of the ilium, above and below that ridge â€¢ fibres descend in different directions, the middle perpen- dicularly, the anterior, which are very short, and the pos- terior, which are long, obliquely ; they all converge into a strong and broad tendon, which is inserted into the upper and outer part of the great trochanter, and is at- tached anteriorly to the tendon of the glutaeus minimus. Use, to abduct the thigh; its posterior fibres can ex- tend and rotate it outwards, its anterior fibres can flex and rotate it inwards ; it also senses to maintain the pelvis in equilibrio on the femur, as when standing on one leg. This muscle is covered in part by the glutaeus maximus ; the anterior and larger portion is covered only by the integuments and fascia lata ; it lies on the glutaeus minimus, its posterior edge is parallel to the pyriform muscle, and separated fiom it by the glu- taeal vessels and nerves ; the anterior edge is nearly pa- rallel to the tensor vaginae muscle, is united to it above, but separated from it below by a quantity of fat, and by several branches of the external circumflex vessels and nen^es. GLUXiEUS Minimus, is exposed by detaching from its origin the glutaeus medius ; small, semicircidar, more tendinous than the last, it arises from the inferior semi- circular ridge on the dorsum of the ilium, and from the rough surface between it and the edge of the acetabu- lum ; the fibres converge as they descend, and end in a strong round twisted tendon, which is inserted into the upper and anterior part of the great trochanter, first passing over a small bursa. Use, similar to the last, it also strengthens the ilio-femoral articulation, and as it adheres to the capsular ligament, it can draw this out of the joint in abduction of the thigh. This muscle is covered by the glutaeus medius, and a little overlapped by the tendon of the pyrifonnis, it covers the capsular ligament and the external tendon of the rectus. Pyrii'ormis, is of a flattened triangular form, the base at the sacrum within the pelvis, the apex at the

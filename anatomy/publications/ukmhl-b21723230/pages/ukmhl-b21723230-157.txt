139 % to different portions of one extensive aponeurosis; as the iliac and transverse fasciae are continued one into the other, external to the iliac artery, a white line may be observed; this is the circumflex ilii artery enclosed in a sort of ca- nal between these fasciae and Poupart’s ligament, to which these aponeuroses are united. The student should next consider how the space, com- monly called the crural arch, is naturally filled ; that por- tion of it between the spine of the ilium and the iliac or femoral arteiy is occupied by the psoas and iliac muscles ; imbedded between these muscles is the anterior crural nerve ; on the pubic side of these muscles is the femoral arter}’, next to which is the femoral vein, and at a little distance to the pubal side of this vessel is Gimbernaut’s ligament, which closes the internal part of this space ; thus almost all the crural arch is filled, except a small portion between the femoral vein and the third insertion of Poupart’s ligament; this space is the femoral or cru- ral ring ; this is somewhat of a triangular form, the base, externally, is the femoral vein, the apex internally is Gimbemaut’s ligament; it is bounded anteriorly by Pou- part’s ligament, and by the superior fibres of the falciform process of the fascia lata, and posteriorly by the pubis, covered by the pectinaeal muscle, and by the pectinaeal portion of the fascia lata. Gimbernaut’s ligament pre- vents femoral hernia occurring internal to this space, which is the only part in the crural arch where a hernia can descend, and even here this accident is in a great de- gree guarded against, as a lymphatic gland generally oc- cupies this situation, and a layer of condensed cellular membrane extends across the opening; this layer is named fascia propria ; this fascia, though weak and indis- tinct in the natural and healthy state, becomes very thick and strong in cases of old femoral hernia ; the fascia pro- pria may be described as arising thin and delicate from the fascia iliaca on the external side of the iliac vessels ; pa.ssing over these vessels it descends internally into the pelvis; inferiorly it is continued along these vessels to Poupart’s ligament, covers the femoral ring, and then as- cending is lost on the inner surface of the fascia transver- salis. Crural hernia cannot occur external to the ring, as

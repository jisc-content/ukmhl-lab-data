369 the coraco-bracliialis, descends on the surface of tlie tri- ceps, along with the ulnar nerve, to the inner condyle, and communicates with the ulnar recurrent. The anastomotica arises about two inches above the joint, passes inwards, supplying the adjacent muscles, and inosculating with the preceding and with the ulnar recurrent arteries. In the triangular hollow at the bond of the elbow, the brachial artery divides into the radial and ulnar. The ttlnar artery is the larger of the two, it de- scends along the idnar side of the fore-arm to the palm of the hand, covered superiorly by the superficial flexors and pronators, and by the median nerve ; inferiorly by the skin and fascia, overlapped, however, by the ten- dons of the flexor digitorum sublimis and flexor cai-pi ulnaris, between which it descends to the wrist; it passes over the brachiaeus anticus, flexor profundus, pronator quadratus, the annular ligament of the caiâ€™pus and the flexor tendons in the palm of the hand ; it is ac- companied by two veins, and by the ulnar nerve, the latter descends along its ulnar side ; it gives off, 1st, the anterior ulnar recurrent, which ascends in front of the inner condyle, on the brachiaeus anticus, and inos- culates with the anastomotica; 2d, the posterior uhiar recurrent, large and tortuous, ascends behind the inner condyle, along the ulnar nerve, and anastomoses with the anastomotica aud inferior profunda arteries ; 3d, in- terosseal artery, passes backwards and divides into an anterior and posterior branch; the anterior interosseal artery descends along the fore-part of the interosseal membrane, beneath the deep flexors, pierces that mem- brane, near the pronator quadratus, and descends on ' the back part of the carpus, and is distributed to the carpal bones, and to the sheaths of the extensor ten- dons ; the posterior interosseal artery passes back- wards beneath the anconseus, and descends along the back of the fore-arm, sending its branches to the ex- tensor muscles; this artery superiorly sends a very large recurrent branch in the anconaeus muscle to the olecranon, to communicate with the superior profunda ; 4th, muscular branches to the two |ayers of flexor 11 3

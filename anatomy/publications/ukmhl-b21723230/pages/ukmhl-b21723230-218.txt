200 The Scrotum is a process of common integument continued from the inner side of each thigh, and from the perinseum and penis ; it is generally of a dark brown colour, thinly covered with hair, and very rugged, being thrown into numerous rugae, it is so thin that the small sub-cutaneous veins and sebaceous follicles can be seen through it; the prominent hard ridge or raphe is continued from the perinaeum along its middle line as far as the penis. The Dartos is the cellular tissue im- mediately subjacent to the skin, it usually presents a red- dish appearance, a number of small vessels being di.stri- buted through it; its texture is very loose, and is readily distended in emphysema or in anasarca ; it never contain.9 any fat; it is somewhat more dense in the mesial line than at either side. The dartos is connected to the rami of the pubis and ischium of each side, and to the raphe in the middle, thence it ascends between the testes to the urethra, and thus assists in forming the septum scroti. The dartos manifests during life a degree of contracti- lity above that which the cellular tissue enjoys in any other situation ; it has therefore been considered by some as a cutaneous muscle ; this idea is probably in- correct, although it certainly possesses the power of corrugating the skin, distinct from that rolling motion of the testicle produced by the cremaster muscle ; pos- teriorly the dartos frequently appears to derive a few muscular fibres from the sphincter ani. The superficial fascia of the scrotum is continued from that of the ab- domen around each spermatic cord and testicle ; it is thin and loose, and becomes continuous wâ€™ith the fascia of the perinaeum : as this fascia envelopes the cord and testis on each side, it assists the dartos in forming the septum scroti, and so retains each testicle at its own side. The tunica conmiunis is composed of the expanded fibres of the cremaster muscle and of fine connecting cellular membrane ; this tunic surrounds the cord and testis : the fibres of the cremaster are expanded chiefly on the fore-part and sides of the testis. The tunica vaginalis was originally a process of the peritonaeum, having been prolonged along the cord and around the testicle as the latter was descending from the abdomen to the scrotum ; at this early age, the tunica vaginalis

3Q5 about half an inch external to the femoral artery ; it in then covered by the fascia lata, becomes flat and broad, and divides into two fascicidi, a superficial and a deep; the superficial separates into four or five long branches which pierce the fascia lata and descend along the inner and fore-part of the thigh to the knee, some of these ac- company the saphena vein. The deep fasciculus is larger, it immediately divides into numei'ous muscular branches which supply the muscles on the outer and fore-part of the thigh ; they are divided into the external and inter- nal branches, the former supply the vastus externus, rectus, iliacus internus, and tensor vaginae muscles ; the internal supply the sartorius, vastus internus, and cru- raeus ; three or four accompany the femoral artery near to the knee ; two or three of these pass into the adjoin- ing muscles, and one, the internal saphenus nerve, con- tinues to descend to the inner side of the knee between the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius ; it then be- comes attached to the saphena vein, and twines round this vessel as far as the inner side of the foot ; in this course it gives numerous filaments to the integuments of the leg. The obturator nerve is smaller than the preced- ing, it arises chiefly from the third lumbar, it perforates the psoas, and descends obliquely inwards along the inner side of that muscle to the obturator foramen, through the upper part of which it escapes into the groin, where it is covered by the pectinaeus, and where it divides into its two branches, an anterior and posterior, having previously sent some twigs to the obturator internus ; the anterior branch is lost in the adductor brevis, pectinaeus, and vas- tus internus, and communicates with the anterior crural; the posterior branch supplies the gracilis, the adductor raagnus, and longus. The lumbosacral nerve proceeds from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves into the pelvis, and soon divides into two branches, the superior glutaeal and the communicating; the glutceal escapes through the upper part of the sciatic notch, and is distributed to the glutaeus medius and minimus muscles along with the branches of the glutaeal artery ; the communicating branch joins the first of the following nerves in the sacral or sciatic plexus.

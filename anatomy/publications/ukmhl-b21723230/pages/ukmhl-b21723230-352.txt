334< several small ganglidns are enclosed, and to the -aggre- gate of these the term cardiac ganglion is applied ; supe- riorly it receives the middle cardiac nerves from each side, also some filaments from the superior cardiac, par- ticularly on the left side, and also some from the inferior cardiac, particularly on the right side ; the greater portion of the right superior cardiac joins the middle cardiac before the latter arrives at the plexus, and the inferior is chiefly distributed on the fore-part of the aorta to the anterior cardiac plexus ; from the great cardiac plexus branches proceed in various directions, some pass backwards en- circling the posterior coronary artery, and forming a plexus around it, and accompanying its branches into the substance of the heart, others pass forwards round the aorta, form the anterior cardiac plexus on it and on the right pulmonary artery, and vena cava ; from this plexus branches descend over the right auricle, accom- pany the anterior coronary artery, and form plexuses around it and its several branches ; from this ganglion also numerous nerves descend on either side along the pulmonary; vessels, and communicate with the pulmonary plexus ; on the left side these branches encircle the duc- tus anteriosus. The sympathetic nerves in the thorax have twelve ganglions on each side, sometimes only eleven, the last cei-vical and first dorsal being then united ; each of the thoracic ganglions is small and triangular, the base towards the spine, the apex externally ; covered by the pleura and placed on the heads of the ribs, the first ganglion is the largest; they all communicate by one or two branches, which ascend obliquely outwards, with the anterior or intercostal branch of the spinal nenâ€™es ; from the base or anterior edge of each ganglion small branches pass forwards to the mediastinum, ramify on the aorta and adjacent vessels, and communicate with the pulmonary plexus. From the six inferior ganglions the splanchnic nerves arise ; these are two in number on each side, the greater and lesser or superior and infe- rior. The great Splanchnic nerve arises by distinct roots from the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ganglions; these descend obliquely forwards and unite on the tenth dorsal vertebra into one cord, which enters

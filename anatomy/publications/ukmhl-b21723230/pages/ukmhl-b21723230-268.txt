2.50 rior and inferior branch; the former supplies the inte- guments of the great toe; the latter passes deep to- wards the sole of the foot, and joins the external plan- tar artery; the anterior tibial artery is accompanied by two veins, Avhich end in the popliteal vein. The pero- nceal nerve winds around the head of the fibula, perfo- rates the peronaeus longus, and divides into several branches; some of these supply the peronaeal muscles, others the integuments on the outer and lore-part of the leg and foot; and the continuation of the peronaeal nerve passes obliquely forwards and downwards, and accompa- nies the anterior tibial artery, lying in general superfi- cial, and to its fibular side. DISSECTIO:^â€™ OF THE MUSCLES OJT THE BACK OF THE LEG. These muscles may be divided into a superficial and a deep layer; the former consists of the gastrocnemius, solaeus, and plantaris ; the latter of the tibialis posticus, flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum communis and poplitaeus. The cutaneous nerves and veins, and the fascia, have been already noticed. Gastrocnemius, large and thick, tendinous below, fleshy and aponeurotic above, and divided into two heads, both of which are somewhat oval, convex be- hind, flat before; the internal, longer and larger than the external; arises from the upper and back part of the internal condyle of the femur, and fleshy from the oblique ridge above it; the external head arises in the same manner, from above the external condyle, but is not so long or large; the fibres of each descend con- verging, and form two fleshy bellies, which unite a lit- tle below the knee in a middle tendinous line; about the middle of the leg the muscle ends in a broad and flat tendon, which gradually unites with that of the solaeus, and both form that strong tendon which is com- monly called the tendo Achillis, and which is inserted into the low'er and back part of the os calcis.

283 tlulla oblongata to its lower extremity, from which it is distinguished by a deep groove : the pons is of a more firm structure than any part of the brain, its surface is white and fibrous; the superficial layer of fibres run transversely from one crus cerebelli to the other, hence the pons has been named the commissure of the cerebel- lum ; beneath this lamina of transverse fibres a quantity of cineritious substance exists, through w'hich while fibrous substance may be seen to ascend obliquely out- wards, in the direction of the crura cerebri. The pons Varolii is described by some authors as a portion of the medulla oblongata; it is, however, so connected with it, as well as with the cerebrum and cerebellum, that it may be considered as equally common to all. DISSECTION OF THE CEREBELLUM. Remove the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, divide the tentorium, and the cerebellum will be exposed; transversely oval, raised in the centre, divided into right and left hemispheres by a deep groove posteriorly and inferiorly, which receives the falx cerebelli, and by a broad notch anteriorly, which is behind the fourth ven- tricle ; the upper surface of each hemisphere is nearly flat, and is marked by a great number of narrow lines which run semicircularly, convex posteriorly; these are fissures into which the pia mater descends, the arach- noid membrane passing over them; these fissures are analogous to those in the cerebrum; they are involu- tions of the grey substance, the superficial extent of which is thus considerably augmented : the same ap- pearance is also observable inferiorly; the lines, how- ever, are not so numerous or regular as above; some lines pass in very deep into the cerebellum, and divide it into lobes, others are only superficial, and divide it into lobules ; the inferior surface of each hemisphere is very convex, and fills the inferior occipital fossm. Along the circumference of each hemisphere a deep fissure extends, at the bottom of which a white cord is observed ; this is the crus cerebelli which ascends ob- liquely forwards and inwards to join tho pons Varolii;

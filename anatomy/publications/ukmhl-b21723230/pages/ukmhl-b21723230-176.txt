158 and the prostate gland; in the female to the uterus and vagina: along the sides of the rectum is a consider- able quantity of cellular tissue, and several vessels, par- ticularly, tortuous veins; inferiorly the levatores ani muscles cover the sides of this intestine, and its lower extremity is surrounded by the orbicular and cutaneous sphincters. The rectum is separated from the bladder in the male, and from the uterus in the female by the cul de sac of the peritonaeum, which may or may not contain some of the small intestines according to the state of the pelvic viscera: the rectum, therefore, is only partially covered by peritonaeum; in the superior third this membrane covers the intestine all around, forming the meso-rectum behind it; in the middle third the peritonaeum is only connected to the forepart, and somewhat to its sides; and its inferior third is wholly unattached to this membrane. The rectum is not saccu- lated like the colon; it is found in general much dilated about an inch above the anus. In order to examine the structure of the intestinal ca- nal, let the student remove the following portions of intestine, including each part between ligatures, having first distended them with air; a portion of duodenum, of jejunum near its commencement, of ileum near its termination, of the arch of the colon, and of the upper part of the rectum ;â€”1st, the duodenum possesses three coats connected to each other by cellular membrane; the peritonseal or serous, the muscular and the mucous ; the first has been already mentioned as giving but a par- tial covering to this intestine ; the muscular coat of the duodenum is formed of strong red fibres, which take a circular direction; there are very few longitudinal fibres to be observed along it, except on the superior trans- verse portion; lay open a part of this intestine, and the internal mucous coat will be found like that of the stomach, thrown into soft folds which lie nearly parallel to each other in a circular direction; these are named valvulse conniventes. 2d, The jejunum and ileum also possess three tunics and intermediate cellular tissue; the serous or peritonmal coat almost perfectly surrounds it, except the small triangular space along the concave side where the vessels and nerves divide,

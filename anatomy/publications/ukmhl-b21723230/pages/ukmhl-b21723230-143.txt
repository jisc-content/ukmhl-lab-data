125 in others. External and superior to the pubis on each side we may always remark the opening called the exter- nal inguinal, or abdominal ring, transmitting in the male subject the spermatic vessels and cremaster muscle, and in the female the round ligament of the uterus. This opening is of a triangular form, the base at the pubis, the apex is superior and external; the sides are called the pillars of the ring, one of which is superior, internal, and anterior; the other, or Poupart’s ligament, is infe- rior, external, and posterior; the first, or superior pillar, is broad, and inserted into the symphysis and into the opposite pubis ; some fibres are continuous with the fascia lata of the opposite thigh ; this pillar decussates with that of the opposite side, on the forepart of the pubis, and both send fibres to the dorsum of the penis ; the inferior pillar is the internal or pubic portion of Poupart’s ligament: the apex of this opening is rounded by a series of fibres, which serve to connect the pillars to each other. These fibres arise from Poupart’s liga- ment at a little distance from the spine of the ilium, pass in curved lines upwards and inwards across the upper part of the ring, and are lost on the surface of the ten- don ; they serve, by preventing the separation of the sides of the ring, to protect this part of the abdomen against a protrusion of its contents. These fibres are in some cases so closely connected, as to merit the name of a fascia (the intercolumnal fascia); this, in old cases of hernia, has been found of great strength, and prolonged for some distance on the hernial sac, and intimately con- nected with the cremaster muscle; it is this fascia, or these intercolumnal bands, that obscure this opening in many cases, and deprive it of that defined figure usually mentioned by writers, or delineated in plates ; the ten- don of the external oblique is alone concerned in the formation of the external abdominal ring, there being no corresponding deficiency in the internal oblique or trans- verse muscle ; the spermatic cord, or round ligament, must therefore take an oblique course to arrive at this opening; this will be seen in the next stage of the dis- section. Poupart's or Fallopius' ligament or the crural arch, is the inferior thickened edge of the tendon of the exter-

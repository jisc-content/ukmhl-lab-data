3U and form there a small plexus termed the anterior -pul- monary ple-xus; this plexus communicates with the phrenic nerve and sends its fine filaments along the pul- monary vessels to the lungs and pericardium ; the greater number of these pulmonic branches pass behind the bronchial tubes to the posterior pulmonic plexus ; near the root of the lung each vagus increases in size, its fibres divide, subdivide, and unite in an areolar or plexiform manner, forming the ^jos^erfor pulmonic- plexus ; this plexus is very large, lymphatic glands and vessels are entangled in it, and several branches from the sympathetic join it; its numerous filaments ac- company the bronchial tubes closely through the sub- stance of the lungs. Below the root of each lung the fibres of each vagus again approximate, and these nerves now become attached to the oesophagus, along which they descend to the stomach, the left on its anterior, the right on its posterior surface; they frequently communicate with each other so as to encircle the oeso- phagus with a sort of plexus, which is named the ceso- phageal plexus, or plexus gulce. On the stomach the right vagus, w'hich is the largest, passes behind the car- diac orifice, to which it sends several small branches which unite with some from the left or anterior nerve ; these form the cardiac plexus which encircles this part of the stomach; it then sends many long filaments to the muscular and mucous coats of the stomach, these communicate with the solar plexus, also with the splenic and hepatic. Tlie left or anterior vagus spreads its branches along the anterior surface of the stomach and the lesser curvature; several of these pass along the lesser omentum to the liver. ^ The Nervus Accessorius, or the third branch of the eighth pair; this nerve, in passing through the fora- men lacerum, is closely connected to the vagus; be- low the base of the cranium it communicates with the eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nen'es, passes behind the internal jugular vein, perforates the upper third of the sterno-mastoid muscle, to which it sends some filaments, it then communicates freely with the cervical plexus, is increased in size, and terminates in the trapezius mus- cle and the integuments.

188 will be seen ; we thus also expose more fully the levator ani muscle. Levator Ani, flat, thin and broad, situated at the inferior part of the pelvis, broader above at its origin than below at its insertion; arises fleshy from the pos- terior part of the symphysis pubis below the true liga- ments of the bladder; thin and tendinous from the ob- turator fascia, and from the ilium above the thyroid hole; thick, tendinous, and fleshy from the inner sur- face of the ischium, and from its spinous process; the fibres descend obliquely inwards, by the side of the neck of the bladder and rectum; the anterior passing more backwards than the others, while the posterior are more transverse or horizontal, inserted, the anterior or pubic fibres into the central point of the perinaeum, and into the fore-part of the rectum, uniting with the fibres from the opposite side. These anterior fibres de- .scend along the side of the prostate gland and the membranous part of the urethra ; the middle fibres into the side of the rectum, passing internal to the sphinc- ters, and united to the outer surface of the longitudinal fibres of the intestine; the posterior fibres into the back part of the rectum, and into a tendinous raphe, extend- ing from it to the os coccygis, in which raphe the muscles from opposite sides unite, also into the two last bones of the coccyx. Use, to raise the rectum when this intestine has been protruded by the efforts of the abdominal muscles to expel its contents; it also assists in closing this intestine, it compresses the vesiculae seminales and prostate gland; the anterior portion supports the perinaeum by raising the com- mon central point, and may also compress and close, like a sphincter, the membranous portion of the ure- thra ; the levator ani completes the inferior boundary of the pelvis and abdomen, and is opposed to the dia- phragm in respiration, being a muscle of expiration. The two levatores ani muscles resemble a funnel, with two openings in it inferiorly: the concavity directed towards the pelvis, the convexity to the perinaeum; through the anterior aperture the urethra passes, through the posterior the rectum. On the perinaeal surface of this muscle are placed the muscles, the trian-

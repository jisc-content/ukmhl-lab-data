418 the apex above, flattened before and behind ; in some, from the effect of dress, it is of an ovoid form, being con- tracted at the lower part and wide in the middle ; the an- terior wall leads obliquely downwards and forwards, and is shorter than the posterior, which is more vertical, and rendered very irregular by the vertebral grooves, and the angles of the ribs; the sides are convex, particularly be- hind ; the intercostal spaces are short, but wide above, long and narrow in the middle, and ag-ain short below ; they are broader before than behind. The apex is small, transversely oval, and very oblique from behind forwards and downwards ; it is bounded by the first ribs, sternum and vertebral column ; the trachea, oesophagus, and the cervical vessels and neiwes pass through it; the base is very large, also transversely oval, and very oblique from before backwards and downwards, it is bounded by the xiphoid cartilage, the conjoined cartilages of the false ribs, and the vertebral column ; it presents a great notch anteriorly, in which the xiphoid cartilage is, and pos- teriorly a small notch on each side for the vertebral co- lumn. The axis of the chest is oblique from above downwards and forwards, in consequence of the oblique direction of the sternum, hence if a line be made to ascend perpendicularly from the base, it will pierce the upper part of the sternum ; and not pass through the apex of the cavity. The dimensions, and even the form of the chest, vary in different individuals and at dif- ferent ages. THE PELVIS. The Pelvis is the deep circular cavity at the lower end of the trunk, bounded by the sacrum, coccyx, and two ossa innominata; the latter in the young subject can be separated each into three, the ilium, ischium, and pubis. The Sacrum, in the erect position of the body, is placed at the upper and back part of the pelvis between the last lumbar vertebra above, the coccyx below, and the ossa innominata on either side ; of a triangular form, the base resembles a vertebra, looks upwards and for-

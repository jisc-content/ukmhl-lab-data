66 heart. The right lung is broader but shorter than the left, the former consists most commonly of three lobes, the latter has only two. The great fissure of each lung descends obliquely forwards; it commences behind the apex, and ends in front of the base ; it divides the sub- stance of the lung, to a great depth, in two lobes; one is anterior and superior, and the other posterior and in- ferior ; the latter is somewhat larger; on the right side a small fissure leads from about the middle of the great one, forwards to the edge of the lung, and cuts off the middle lobe from the superior; this fissure does not pene- trate to the same depth as the great one does; it is some- times absent, and in some subjects it exists on the left as well as on the right side. The root of each lung is situated a little above the centre of the internal surface, and about two-thirds from the anterior edge ; the phre- nic nerve and a few filaments of the pneumogastric lie anterior to it, and the pulmonary plexus is posterior to it; the fold called ligamentum-latum is below it; it con- sists of several vessels and nerves connected together by cellular tissue, and all enclosed between the laminae of pleura; dissect off this membrane from the fere part of the root, and we shall observe the two pulmonary veins inferior, but anterior to the pulmonary artery, which is immediately above and behind them ; posterior and su- perior to the artery is the bronchial tube ; a quantity of cellular tissue connects these vessels, and contains the bronchial arteries and veins, also several nerves, w'hich are derived from the pulmonary plexus. In the root of the left lung the bronchial tube is rather inferior to the artery, but still posterior to it, as on the right side. The lungs have a peculiar soft, emphysematous feel, and are so light as to float in water ; their colour is grey, inter- spersed wdth spots of dark blue or blackish tint: the younger the subject the redder the lungs will be found ; in the adult they are generally grey, and slightly rtreaked with dark lines ; in the old they are usually mottled with blue or black spots, which exist, not merely on the sur- face, but through their substance. The lungs are com- posed of the ramifications of the pulmonary arteries and veins, of the bronchial arteries and veins, of the pulmo- nary nerves, of lymphatic vessels and glands, and of the

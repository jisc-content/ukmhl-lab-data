437 deep channel, which forms the roof of each naris, on each side of this we observe an irregular long struc- ture which consists of three parts, an internal curved lamina (the superior turbinated bone,) a middle range of cells, and externally towards the orbit a smooth square plate, the os planum : the turbinated or spongij bone is a very thin plate descending at first vertically, and then bending outwards, and rolled upon itself for nearly half a turn ; in this is a depression or sort of cleft, which is called the superior meatus of the nose, this channel or meatus extends along the posterior half of the eethmoid, it is closed before except in a small aperture which leads into the posterior sethmoid cells ; the portion of the turbinated plate which extends be- low this fossa is named the middle spongy bone, it is larger than the upper portion, more curved and very concave outwardly, beneath this is a deep fossa named the middle meatus of the nose; the cethmoid cells are external to the turbinated plates, bounded above by the cribriform plate, and externally by the os planum, the cells are about twelve or fourteen in number, and are divided by a bony septum into an anterior and poste- rior set, the posterior are small, and open info the mid- dle meatus, and sometimes one of the uppermost com- municate with the sphenoid sinus or open into the fossa of its turbinated plate ; the anterior cells are larger and more numerous, they open into the middle meatus, one of the most anterior is curved into a sort of tube, the infundibulum, into this the frontal sinus opens above, and it terminates before the orifice of the great maxil- lary sinus or antrum ; all these cells are lined by the pituitory membrane, which, however, is less vascular and thick than that on the nasal lamella or turbinated bones; on this membrane, particularly that covering the supe- rior spongy bone, and the square surface before it, the external olfactory canals chiefly end ; from the lower surface of the aethmoidal cells thin plates of bone often descend very irregularly to join the superior max- illary ; external to the cells on each side is the os planum or orbital plate, very smooth and polished, articulated above to the frontal, before to the lachry- mal, behind to the sphenoid, and below to the maxil-

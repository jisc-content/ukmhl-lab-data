183 .Sphincter Internus, vel Orbicularis, consists of a thick, but pale fasciculus of muscular fibres, which encircles the lower extremity of the rectum, having no attachment to the coccyx behind, and but a slight one to the central point before : it is in close contact with the mucous membrane of the intestine ; its use is simi- lar to that of the last described muscle. Its surfaces are internal and external, its edges superior and infe- rior. Anterior to, and on each side of the anus, we find beneath the integuments a condensed cellular tex- ture, covering the other muscles in the perinaeum ; this is the superficial fascia; it is continued from the inner side of one thigh across the perinaeum to the opposite, adhering to the rami of the ischium and pubis on each side, by tendinous fibres ; this fascia is very dense about the middle of the perinaeum ; posteriorly, on either side of the anus it is loaded with soft large grained adipose substance: anteriorly it extends over the scrotum, and becomes thin and fine, like reticular membrane, and continuous with the superficial fascia from the abdo- men. This fascia covers the vessels, and all the muscles of the perinaeum, except the two sphincters of the anus. Separate this fascia from one side of the perinaeum, and reflect it towards the opposite; its density and close connexion to the lateral boundaries of this region, will then become obvious; a number of veins and nerves, and a quantity of fat also will be observed ; when the latter is dissected away, those muscles of the perinaeum, which are attached to the penis and urethra, will ap- pear, covered, however, by a fine but dense aponeuro- sis, which may be next dissected off: these muscles are six in number, three on each side, viz. the erector penis, transversalis perinaei, and accelerator urinae.* If the perinaeum be divided by a transverse line drawn from one tuberosity of the ischium to the other, into an an- terior and posterior part, we shall find that the anterior triangular space contains the six muscles just named, also the crura penis and the corpus spongiosum urethrae: * A knowledge of these fascia; will explain the resistance which this structure presents to collections of urine or of pus from coming to the surface.

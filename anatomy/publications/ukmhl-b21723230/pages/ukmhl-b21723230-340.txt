322 three branches, which supply the muscles and both sides of the little finger, also the ulnar side of the ring finger; the deep palmar branch passes beneath the flexor tendons, runs across the metacarpus, and assists in forming a deep palmar arch, the branches of which are lost in the interossei muscles. Musculo-spiral nerve, is a very large nerve, it proceeds from the middle and lower divisions of the plexus, descends ob- liquely backwards and outwards between the three por- tions of the triceps, round the humerus to its external side, it then turns obliquely forwards and downwards towards the elbow, between the supinator longus and the brachiaeus anticus, and there divides into two branches, an anterior or radial branch, a posterior or interosseal branch. In its course down the arm this nerve sends several branches to the triceps, a little above the outer condyle it gives off a large cutaneous branch, which branch descends along the radial side of the fore-arm to the thumb; at the bend of the elbow this nerve sends several branches to the long and short supinators, also to the extensors of the carpus; on the surface of the supinator brevis it expands and divides into its terminating branches; the anterior or the radial nerve descends along the inner side of the supi- nator longus, which it supplies, and external to the ra- dial artery; about the middle of the fore-arm or a little low^er, this nerve passes behind the tendon of the supi- nator longus, and becoming cutaneous descends behind the radius to the back of the hand, where it divides into two considerable branches, one for the integuments of the thumb, the other expands on the dorsum of the hand and supplies the index and middle finger, and communicates with the dorsalis ulnaris nerve. The deep branch of the musculo-spiral nerve or the pos- terior interosseal nerve, winds backwards round the upper part of the radius and the supinator brevis, it then descends along the back part of the fore-arm, with the posterior interosseal artery, and divides into several branches superficial and deep, which supply the two layers of extensor muscles. Circumflex or articular nerve, arises from the lowâ€™er part of the plexus, descends round the lower edge of the sub-scapular muscle, and

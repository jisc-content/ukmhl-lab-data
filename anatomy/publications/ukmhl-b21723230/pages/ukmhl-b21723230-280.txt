262 forwards and inwards, towards the first metatarsal bone, above the second layer of the plantar mascles, and be- tween the first and second metatarsal bones it joins the deep branch of the anterior tibial artery, and thus forms the great plantar arch of arteries, from the convexity of which proceed the digital arteries, to supply the toes, (see Anatomy of the Vascular System.) The posterior tibial artery and its several branches are accompanied by cor- responding veins, all of which end in the popliteal vein. The posterior tibial nerve is the principal branch of the sciatic, it accompanies the posterior tibial arterjâ€™, at first lying to its tibial, afterwards to its fibular side ; in this course it sends off several small branches to the deep and superficial muscles of the leg, and between the heel and ankle it divides into the two plantar nerves, which take the course of the corresponding arteries. In this internal malleolar region, when the integuments, fascia, and internal annular ligament are removed, we find the three tendons, the posterior tibial nerves and vessels to have the following relation to each other, the tibialis pos- ticus and flexor communis tendons are bound close to the ankle ; about half an inch behind these is the. posterior tibial artery accompanied by two veins, the nerve is a little nearer to the heel, and the tendon of the flexor pollicis lies about half an inch nearer to the latter.

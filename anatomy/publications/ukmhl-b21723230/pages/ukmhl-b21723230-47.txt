29 joined together as to resemble one irreg-ular glandular mass, the parotid being united to the submaxillary behind the angle of the jaw, and the latter being- connected to the sublingual around the mylo-hyoid muscle. Hyo-glossus is fla.t and thin, arises from the cornu and part of the body of the os hyoides, ascends a little outwai-ds, mserted into the side of the tongue. Use, to render the dorsum of the tongue convex by depressing its side; it may also elevate the os hyoides and base of the tongue. This muscle is covered % the mylo-hyoid in part, and by the sublingual gland and lingual nerve; it lies on the middle constrictor of the pharynx, the lin- gual artery, and the substance of the tongue. Gexio-hyo-glossus is triang-ular, arises by a small tendon from an eminence inside the chin, beneath the frasnum linguae; thence the fibres radiate, the superior ascend and turn forvvards towards the tip of the tongue, the middle also ascend, some inclining forwards, others backwards; the inferior and posterior pass backwards and downwards to the base of the os hyoides.â€”Inserted into the mesial line of the tongue from the apex to the base, and into the body and lesser cornu of the os hy- oides. Use, the posterior fibres can draw the os hy- oides towards the chin and push the tongue forwards, the anterior can draw back the tongue, and bend its tip down towards the frsenum, the middle portion can de- press the middle of the tongue and make it concaTO from side to side ; it can also draw it forwards so as to enlarge the opening of the fauces. This muscle is there- fore used in mastication and deglutition, also in the arti- culation of several letters. The several muscles last described cover this muscle externally ; internally it is in contact with its fellow. Lingua LIS is a fasciculus of fibres taking a longitu- dinal course on the inferior surface of the tongue from I the base to the apex, and intermixing with the mus- cles on either side, so that it appears as being derived from these rather than as a distinct muscle; the fibres are attached through their whole length, and are mixed with a soft fatty substance; anteriorly they are broader and more distinct; they are situated between tho

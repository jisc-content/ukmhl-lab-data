216 wards and backwards ; each terminates in a soft fringed extremity, called Corpus Jimbriatum ; these canals are nanow where they join the uterus, but each increases in size near the corpus fimbriatum. The ovaria are two small, white, flattened, oval bodies, one at each side, enclosed in the posterior fold of the broad ligament, and behind the Fallopian tube. Each ovary is con- nected to the side of the uterus by the broad ligament of the latter, also by a round fibrous cord, the proper ligament of the ovary ; this is about two inches long, and is enclosed between the laminae of the broad liga- ment of the uterus. Each ovary is covered by the peri- tonaeum, which adheres very closely to it; beneath this is a strong white fibrous capsule, within which a number of small vesicles will be found connected together by cel- lular membrane and vessels. CHAP. VIII. DISSECTION OF THE INFERIOE EXTREMITIES. Each inferior extremity is connected to the trunk by the strong ligaments of the hip joint, and by several muscles which pass from the pelvis to the thigh and leg. This dissectionâ€™ may be performed while the pelvis remains attached to the spine, or the former may be separated from the Inmbar vertebrae, and divided into tW'O. The muscles of the lower extremity are classed into those of the thigh, leg, and foot. SECTION I. DISSECTIOX OF THE MUSCLES OF THE THIGH.

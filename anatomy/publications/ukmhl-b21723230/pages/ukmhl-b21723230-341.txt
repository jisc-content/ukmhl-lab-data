3Q3 passing backwards and outwards, leaves the axilla by a large opening between the humerus and the long head, of the triceps, above the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles, and below the capsular liga- ment of the shoulder joint, it then winds round the neck of the humerus, attached to the internal surface of the deltoid; in this course this nerve sends some small branches to the sub-scapular and the adjacent muscles, it then divides into two branches, a superior and infe- rior, both of which encircle the neck of the humerus, and send their numerous subdivisions into the deltoid muscle. The Dorsal Nerves are twelve in number, the first pair passes between the two first dorsal vertebrae, and the last pair below the last dorsal vertebra, they also all divide into a posterior and an anterior or intercostal branch ; the posterior branches are small, pass backwards between the transverse processes, and supply the mus- cles and integuments of the back and loins ; of the an- terior branches that of the first dorsal is the largest, it rises above the neck of the first rib, and joins the last cervical nerve in the brachial plexus; the anterior branches of the second and third are smaller, they pro- ceed backwards and outwards between the corresponding- ribs, and covered internally by the pleura ; at the angle of each rib they pass between the intercostal muscles, run along the groove in the lower edge of each rib, supply the surrounding muscles, and opposite the axilla each sends a filament across this cavity to the integu- ments on the inner and back part of the arm; these filaments are named the nerves of Wrisberg, or the cutaneous nerves of the arm; these two intercostal or spinal nerves then continue on in their course below the first and second ribs, and ultimately end in small cutaneous and muscular branches, which are lost on the lateral and fore-part of the thorax; the anterior or in- tercostal branches of the remaining nine dorsal nerves all pass in a similar manner between the ribs, and sup- ply not only the intercostal but also the adjacent mus- cles ; the two last are chiefly distributed to the ab- dominal muscles and to the diaphragm; the twelfth dorsal sends a branch close to the vertebrae to join the

77 minata is most anterior, and the left subclavian the most posterior of the three. The trachea is next seen enter- ing the thorax, behind these vessels, and inclining a lit- tle to the right side ; this tube commences opposite the 5th or 6th cervical vertebra, descends at first in the middle line, but as it approaches the chest, it inclines to the right, the aorta pressing on its left side: in the neck it rests on the oesophagus, and lies between the great vessels; it is covered by the thyroid gland and its â€¢reins, the sternal muscles, the arteria and left vena inno- minata: in the thorax, the trachea descends obliquely backwards, and opposite the 3d dorsal vertebra it di- vides into the right and left bronchial tubes ; a number of dark lymphatic glands (the bronchial glands) lie in the angle of the division, and adhere closely to the branches. The trachea is composed of 18 or 20 fibro cartilages, connected together by an elastic substance, and lined by mucous membrane ; each cartilage forms about three-fourths of a circle, the deficiency posteriorly being filled by a fibrous membrane, which also encloses the cartilages, and by some transverse muscular fibres and mucous glands; the right bronchial tube is the larger branch ; it runs transversely into the root of the lung, and divides into three branches ; the vena azygos bends over this vessel; the left bronchial tube is longer, and takes a course slightly curved downwards and to the left side, through the arch of the aorta to the root of the left lung, and then divides into two branches; the further subdivisions of these two tubes gradually lose the cartilaginous structure, divide into numerous fine membranous vessels, which terminate in small cells; these communicate with each other, and on these the pulmonary vessels minutely ramify: the bronchi are composed of the same structures as the trachea, the car- tilages, however, soon lose their annular form, and be- come irregular; in their minute subdivisions they no longer exist; the air serves to retain these as well as the cells in a permanently distended condition. Behind the trachea, the oesophagus is seen entering the thorax, lying close to the spine ; at first a little to the left of the mesial line, afterwards to the right of that line, and as it descends through the posterior mediastinum, it again inclines to

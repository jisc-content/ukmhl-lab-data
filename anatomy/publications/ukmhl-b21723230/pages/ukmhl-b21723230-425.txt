PART V. DESCRIPTION OF THE BONES. -I IIE osseous structure is the hardest in the body ; it is composed chiefly of phosphate of lime, with a little car- bonate deposited in a cartilaginous substance which is perfectly organized and w'ell supplied with vessels for its nourishment and growth. The bones present great va- riety of figure ; they are commonly classed into the flat, long, and irregular. They support and protect the soft parts, give the general form to the whole body as well as to its different parts, they also serve as the passive or- gans of locomotion, affording a series of levers by means of which the muscles effect the various motions and ac- tions of the body. When all the bones are connected by their ligaments the collection is called a natural skeleton; when united by art, an artiflcml skeleton. The skeleton is divided into the trunk and extremities. The trunk consists of the middle part and two extre- mities ; the middle of the trunk is formed by the verte- bral column and the chest; the upper extremity of the trunk is the head, the lower the pelvis. The vertebral column consists of twenty-four verte- i brae, which are divided into three classes according to i the three regions, viz. seven cervical, twelve dorsal, i and five lumbar. The chest or thorax is formed before by the sternum, < which consists of two or three pieces,, on either side by i the twelve ribs, and behind by the dorsal vertebrae, j The head comprises the cranium and the face : the i cranium %T skull, is composed of the frontal, the two li |i I

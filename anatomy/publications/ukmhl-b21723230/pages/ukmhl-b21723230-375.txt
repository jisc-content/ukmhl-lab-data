PART III. CHAPTER I. ANATOMY OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. UNDER THIS HEAD WE MAY CONSIDER THE ANA- TOJIY OF THE ARTERIES, VEINS, AND LYMPHA- TICS, SECTION I. ANATOMY OF THE ARTERIES. IIE principal blood-vessels have been already described in the anatomy of the different regions ; in the present section the arteries shall be considered in a systematic manner, commencing with the aorta, and tracing its branches through all parts of the body. Aorta arises from the upper part of the left ven- tricle, opposite the fourth or fifth dorsal vertebra, (see page 72,) ascends obliquely forwards and to the right side, then turns backwards and to the left, and then de- scends along the dorsal vertebrae ; it thus forms the arch which terminates on the left side of the fourth vertebra; the thoracic aorta descends along the left side of the re- maining dorsal vertebrae, inclining a little to their fore- part inferiorly, and passes between the crura of the diaphragm: the abdominal aorta descends on the lum- bar vertebrae, as far as the fourth or fifth, -where it di- vides into the two common iliac arteries. The aorta is at first covered by the pericardium and the pulmonary artery ; as it ascends it lies between this vessel and the vena cava; the arch lies on the trachea a little above its division, and on the bodies of the second and third ver-

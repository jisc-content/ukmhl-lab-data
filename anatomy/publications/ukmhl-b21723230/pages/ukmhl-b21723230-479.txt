461 neck; the body then becomes triangular, is twisted a little and curN'ed outwards, its inner surface looks a lit- tle backwards above but is twisted forwards below ; this is divided into two portions by the internal edge into which the interosseous ligament is inserted, the anterior portion gives attachment to the extensors, and the pos- terior is grooved for the tibialis posticus, its external surface is covered by the peronaei muscles, the posterior surface gives attachment to the solaeus above and to the tiexor pollicis below; in this surface we perceive the orifice of the vascular canal leading downwards ; the in- ternal edge gives attachment to muscles above and to the interosseous ligament belowâ€™, the external edge is turned backwards and gives attachment to the solaeus, flexor pollicis, and peronaei muscles; and the anterior edge to the extensor digitorum and to the peronaei; inferiorly this edge turns outwards, and bifurcates, enclosing a triangular surface, which is subcutaneous ; the lower or tarsal end is larger than the head; it is elongated into a long oval process, the external malleolus or ankle, this is larger, more prominent and posterior to the inner ankle, it is convex and subcutaneous exter- nally, internally it is smooth and triangular, a little con- cave from behind forwards and convex in the perpendi- cular direction, it articulates with the astragalus, above this is a triangular rough surface to articulate with the tibia, anteriorly this process is rough but tbin for the origin of ligaments, its posterior edge is broader and grooved for the peronaeal tendons, internal to which is a depression for the origin of the posterior lateral, or the transverse ligament of the ankle joint; from the point of this process the external laterd ligament arises; the fibula is articulated at both ends to the tibia and below to tbe astragalus. The Foot is divided into the tarsus, metatarsus, and toes. The bones of the tarsus are seven, astragalus, calcaneum, navicular, cuboid, and three cuneiform. The Astragalus is next to the calcaneum in point of size, it is of an irre^lar twisted shape, larger above and to the outside than internally or posteriorly ; it is situated at the upper and middle part of the tarsus, where it is tt'edged between the two malleoli, its superior surface

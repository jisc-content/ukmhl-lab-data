192 gular space or portion of the bladder, just aljove and behind the prostrate gland, which is bounded on either side by the vasa deferentia and vesiculae seminales, pos- teriorly by the cul de sac of the peritonaeum, and an- teriorly by the prostrate gland which forms the apex of this triangle ; within this space the muscular coat of the bladder is in contact with the rectum, and from the cavity of the latter the former organ may be perforated during life without injuring any important part; this space is about three inches and a half, or four inches from the anus, and is selected by some surgeons as the best situation for tapping the bladder in case of reten- tion of urine, when a catheter cannot be passed through the urethra. The student may now proceed to exa- mine the pelvic viscera ; for this purpose, separate the left crus penis from the bone, also the left border of the triangular ligament (if not already done), and detach the levator ani muscle of the left side from the bone; with the hand separate the cellular and aponeurotic bands which lie superior to this muscle ; then divide the symphysis pubis, or saw the left os pubis about half an inch external to the symphysis, divide the left ilio- sacral articulation, cut through the psoas muscle and iliac vessels, and then remove the os innominatum and lower extremity of the left side ; the pelvic viscera will remain in the concavity of the sacrum and of the oppo- site os innominatum. These viscera will be rendered more distinct by a little dissection ; first, moderately in- flating the bladder through the ureter, a ligature having been tied around the penis, the rectum also may be moderately distended with curled hair or a sponge, and attached to the spine by a ligature. The -pelvic portion of the peritonceum should be first attended to ; this mem- brane may be now seen to descend along the sides and fore-part of the rectum to within about four inches of the anus, whence it is reflected on the lower and back part of the bladder : the line of this reflection is, in the recumbent position of the subject, opposite the lower margin of the third piece of the sacrum; in the erect posture it will be found on a level with the junction of the sacrum and coccyx ; the peritonaeum is reflected on the bladder between the middle of the vesicula.' semi-

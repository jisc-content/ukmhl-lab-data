GO forwards and downwards; hence the perpendicular di- ameter of the thorax is much greater posteriorly than it is behind the sternum. The apex of the thorax is somewhat truncated, and presents an oval opening longer transversely than from before backwards; this, the superior orifice of the thorax, is bounded anteriorly by the upper edge of the sternum and interclavicular li- gament, posteriorly by the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, and laterally by the first rib; the several im- portant parts which pass through this opening shall be noticed afterwards. The inferior circumference of the thorax is five or six times more extensive than the supe- rior ; it is bounded by the xiphoid, the last true and all the false costal cartilages, and by the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae; its longer diameter is also trans- verse. Open the cavity by dividing the cartilages of the ribs on each side of the sternum, and raising the latter from below upwards; if we look under the ster- num as we thus slowly raise it, we perceive that space called anterior mediastinum to be gradually developed, from the right and left pleurae separating from each other as we tear the loose cellular membrane which na- turally connects the pleurae and pericardium to the pos- terior surface of the bone; when the sternum is re- moved this region is fully exposed; it is described as being of a triangular form, the base, the sternum ; the sides, the pleurae, converging behind so as nearly to touch each other; the apex, the small portion of peri- cardium left uncovered by the pleurae; naturally, how- ever, all the parts within the thorax are so closely ap- plied to the parietes, that no space or cavity of a de- fined form, like that assigned to the anterior mediasti- num, can truly be said to exist. Tlie dissector, how- ever, may cause this space to appear more distinct by tlie following precaution: before you divide the carti- lages, push your fingers from the abdomen behind the sternum, and break down the cellular connexions be- tween it and the pleurae, then cut the cartilages very near the sternum, and raise the latter; without this pre- caution before dividing the cartilages, the pleura, par- ticularly the right, will be in almost every instance laid open, and so the appearance of the anterior mediastinum

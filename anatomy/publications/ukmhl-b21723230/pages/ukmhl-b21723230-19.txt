THE DUBLIN DISSECTOR. CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD AND FACE. SECTION I. EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. T-he integuments covering the cranium are firm and dense, although when felt they give the sensation of being thin: the cuticle is delicate, but the cutis is very thick:, the subjacent cellular membrane contains granulated fat, and the bulbs of the hairs, which after- wards perforate the skin in an oblique direction. The cellular tissue here has partly a ligamentous structure, and adheres so intimately to the subjacent muscular and tendinous expansion, that the inexperienced stu- dent may find some difficulty in exposing the surface of the latter. Make an incision through the integuments along the median line, from the tuberosity of the occi- pital bone, as far forwards as the lower part of the fore- head : from each extremity of this, make a transverse incision about three inches long; let the posterior one be parallel to the superior transverse ridge of the occi- pital bone, and the anterior one parallel, and about half an inch superior to the eyebrow ; cautiously dissect off the integuments from the subjacent muscular and tendinous expansion, wfiich is thq occipito-frontalis.

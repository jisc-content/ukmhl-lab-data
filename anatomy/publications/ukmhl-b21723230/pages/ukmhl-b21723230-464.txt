UG fossa and duct; its internal surface forms part of the na- sal fossa and is connected to the ethmoid bone above, be- low this is a channel that leads to the middle meatus, and inferior to this is a crest for the spongy bone ; between the nasal and malar processes is the orbital plate, of a triangular form, the base joined to the ethmoid, lachrj-- mal and palate bones ; this process looks downwards and forwards ; its outer and posterior edge bounds the spheno- maxillary fissure ; the infra-orbital canal, which runs along it in a direction forwards and inwards, lodges the vessels and nerves of that name ; this canal divides ante- riorly into two, the smaller is the anterior dental, w'hich descends in the anterior wall of the antrum, where it ter- minates by communicating with the anterior alveoli, the other, or the proper infra-orbital canal is wdder, and ends in the infra-orbital hole ; the edge of the bone above this hole is round to form part of the contour of the orbit, behind which the inferior oblique muscle of the eye arises; behind and below this plate is the tuberosity, this is more prominent in the young, as it contains the last molar tooth, after the protrusion of which it diminishes, near this are three or four small holes, the posterior dental canals which lead to the posterior alveoli; beneath the orbital plate, the body of the bone is excavated into a large ca- vity, the antrum highmorianum, of somewhat a triangu- lar figure, the base towards the nose, the apex towards the malar process; this is the largest sinus connected with the nose, it is sometimes divided by septa as well as by the anterior dental canal into two or more cells ; the infra- orbital canal runs along its roof, through the floor, one or two of the molar alveoli project and sometimes open, the canine fossa is in front of it, and the tuber bounds it behind, this cavity is lined by the membrane of the nose; in the skeleton the opening in its base is very large and irregular, but in the natural state it is contracted by the ethmoid bone above, by the palate bone behind, and by the inferior spongy bone below, also by the lining membrane of the nose; it opens by one or two small oblique openings into the middle meatus of the nose, anterior to which is the infundibulum, a deep groove leading do^vnwards, backwards, and inwards, from the frontal sinus and the

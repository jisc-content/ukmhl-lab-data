41^0 wing is a long slit, the foramen lacerum orbitale, wide internally, narrow externally where the frontal bone sometimes assists in closing it, it transmits the third, fourth, first branch of the fifth and the sixth pair of nerves from the cranium to the orbit: from the angle between the body and ala, the pterygoid plate descends perpendicularly, internally it bounds the posterior naris, externally the external pterygoid muscle is attached to it, anteriorly the palate bone is connected to it, poste- riorly it is hollowâ€™ed into the pterygoid fossa, which lodges the internal pterygoid muscle, and in a small de- pression internal to this the tensor palati muscle; this fossa thus divides this process into two plates, the exter- nal is broad and rough, the internal is longer and nar- rower, and ends in the liamiilar process, a small deli- cate hook, convex inwards, concave outwards, and co- vered by a bursa, round this the tendon of the tensor palati muscle turns ; in the inferior notch between these plates the palate bone is received; above the internal pterygoid plate is the vidian hole or canal, this opens anteriorly on the inner side of the foramen rotundum, into the spheno-maxillaiy fossa, and posteriorly into the foramen lacerum anterius, it transmits the vidian nerve and vessels. The structure of the sphenoid bone is very compact, except the body which is cellular; the latter about ten years of age undergoes the process of absorp- tion, whereby the cavities called the sphenoid sinuses are formed ; these open into the upper and back part of the nose ; in front of them in the adult is a small cuired plate of bone, the sphenoidal turbinated bone, it is of a pyramidal form, the base anteriorly connected to the posterior aethmoid cells, the apex posteriorly, and joined to the fore-part of the sinus, it lies above the spheno- palatine foramen, a hole which is below the body of the sphenoid, and between the orbital processes of the palate bone; this hole leads from the nose to the spheno-max- illary space; these superior spongy bones are wanting in the child and sometimes in the adult. The sphenoid is articulated to the seven bones of the cranium and to five of the face, viz., the two malar, twx) palate, and the vomer, and in some cases to the superior maxillary by the pterygoid plates, the palate bones how'ever in gene-

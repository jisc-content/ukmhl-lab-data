220 of adipose substance, and by a few deep-seated Ijth- phatic glands ; when these are removed, we alwaj's find i,he vein internal to the artery, and about an inch and a half from the spine of the pubis ; immediately external to the vein is the artery resting on the psoas, and about a quarter of an inch external to the artery is the ante- rior crural neiwe, imbedded between the psoas and ilia- cus, and covered by the fascia iliaca, it does not there- fore lie in the sheath of the vessels. Clean the several muscles which now partially appear on the fore-part of the thigh: external to the vessels, the sartorius and . tensor vaginae are first seen; internal to the vessels are the pectinaeus,! gracilis, and the three adductors, and ini- mediately covering the anterior and lateral parts of the femur are the rectus, cruraeus, vastus internus, and ex- ternus. MUSCLES ON THE FORE-PART AND SIDES OF THE THIGH. Tensor, vaginae femoris, at the upper and outer part of the thigh, narrow above, broad and thin below, arises tendinous and fleshy from the external part of the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; it forms a fleshy belly, which descends obliquely back- wards, and is inserted, broad and thin, into a duplica- tiire of the fascia lata on the outside of the thigh, about three inches below the great trochanter; use, to make tense the fascia, to rotate the thigh inwards; also, to assist in flexing and abducting it. The origin of this muscle is between the sartorius and glutasus medius; bettveen these muscles it descends, covered by the fascia lata; its insertio'n is anterior to that of the glutaeus niaxiinus muscle. Sartorius is the longest muscle in the body, thin and flat like a riband, broader in the middle than at the extremities, situated obliquely along the anterior and inner side of the thigh, arises by short tendinous fibres from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and from the notch below that process, it soon becomes broad and fleshy, extends obliquely across the thigh to its in- ner side, and descending perpendicularly to the knee

196 each is continuous with the anterior ligament, and is formed by the reflection of the pelvic fascia from the in- ner surface of the levator ani to the side of the prostate gland and of the bladder. The superior and anterior extremity of the bladder is sometimes named the superior fundus ; the posterior extremity, which presses against the rectum, the infe- rior fundus ; the inten'ening portion is called the body, and that part which is connected to the pubes the cer- vix ; the latter is surrounded by the prostate gland, very little, however, of this gland being above it. The cendx presents somewhat a conical figure ; and in the adult lies nearly horizontal, below and behind the pubes ; in the child it is more vertical. If the bladder be moderately distended it wall be found to present six regions, on each of which some important object may be noticed. 1st, The superior region, is in contact pos- teriorly with the convolutions of the small intestines, and anteriorly with the recti abdominis muscles ; to it are attached the urachus and obliterated umbilical ar- teries ; posterior to these this region is covered by pe-r ritonacuin, whereas anterior to them this membrane is deficient. If the bladder be much distended, this re- gion is sometimes found to incline to the left side. 2d, and 3d ; The lateral regions are continuous to the sides of the pelvis, to tlie vesical fascia, and to the levatores ani muscles : descending obliquely backwards along this region on each side, we find the vas deferens cross- ing over the obliterated umbilical artery above, and over the ureter below, thus passing internal to both, or nearer to the mesial line ; the peritonaeum adheres to so much of each lateral region of the bladder as lies posterior to the vas deferens while that portion anterior to it is de- ficient of this serous covering. 4th, The anterior re- gion is behind the recti muscles, the pubes, the pubic ligament, and the triangular ligament of the urethra; all this region wants the peritonaeal covering ; tow'ards its inferior part w'e observe the anterior ligaments of the bladder, between them the dorsal veins of the penis, and below them the neck of the bladder surrounded by the prostate gland. 5th, The posterior region is continuous to the rectum in the male, to the uterus in the female.

46^ presents in its two posterior thirds a large pulley-like articular surface, which is convex from behind forw'ards, and concave transversely, it is inclined a little back- wards, is broader before than behind, and more promi- nent externally than internally; anterior to this is a rough depression, on the neck of the bone, for the in- sertion of ligaments ; inferiorly, it presents two articular surfaces for the os calcis, one is posterior and external, broad and concave, the other is anterior and internal and convex; these surfaces are separated by a deep groove, which is narrow behind, broad before, and directed for- wards and outwards ; strong ligaments pass from this groove to the os calcis ; the posterior surface of the as- tragalus is narrow and slightly grooved in an oblique di- rection, downw'ards and inwards for the tendon of the flexor pollicis ; it presents externally a pointed eminence to which the external lateral ligament of the ankle joint is attached; the anterior extremity is a smooth round head supported by a sort of neck, it is directed forwards, inw'ards, and downwards, and is articulated with the na- vicular bone; the external side presents a triangular, smooth surface, concave from above downwards, and a little convex from before backwards, it is articulated with the fibula; the inner side is rough for ligaments, except a cartilaginous surface near the upper part, which is smaller than that on the outer side, and broader before than behind, this is articulated wuth the internal mal- leolus. The Calcaneum or os calcis is the largest bone in the tarsus, at the lower and posterior part of which it is placed, it is elongated posteriorly into a process called the heel, its upper surface presents two articulating surfaces to support the astragalus; the posterior is convex, broad, and directed forwards and outwards, the anterior is internal, narrow, and concave ; these are separated by a deep rough transverse groove into which strongâ€™ ligaments are inserted ; internal to this the bene is uneven, and projects into a sort of process, into which the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint is inserted; the inferior surface is smaller than the superior and is nearly flat, it presents small tubercles for the attachment of muscles and ligaments; the pos-

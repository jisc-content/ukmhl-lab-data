â€œeddish colour descends, the infundibulum ; this passes behind and rather beneath the commissure of the optic nerves ; it terminates on the surface of the pituitary gland ; it is surrounded by arachnoid membrane ; it is not pervious inferiorly ; above it communicates with the third ventricle. The pituitary body is placed in the sella tur- cica between the dura mater and arachnoid membrane ; transversely oval, composed anteriorly of a yellowish sub- stance, which is notched before, and convex behind like a kidney, and posteriorly of a whitish semi-fluid or pulpy substance. Behind the corpora albicantia, we next ob- serve a small triangular depression, closed above by a thin plate which forms the posterior part of the floor of the third ventricle ; this is the middle perforated plate of the brain ; on either side of this is the crus cerebri, con- necting the cerebrum to the pons Varolii, which last is situated in the median line behind the last described sub- stances ; behind the pons is the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, and between these eminences is the great transverse fissure which transmits the pia mater into the ventricles, and which also contains the arachnoid canal and the pineal gland; behind this we observe, last- ly, the posterior extremity of the median fissure separat- ing the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. Cut off the upper part of one hemisphere nearly on a level with the corpus callosum, the appearance now presented is termed the centrum ovale minus, a mass of white substance surrounded by the irregularly undulat- ing line of grey substance ; a small cavity or fissure may noAV also be observed between the corpus callosum and the lower and internal margin of each hemisphere : next slice off both hemispheres on a level with the cor- pus callosum, and the centrum magnum ovale is pre- sented, that is, a line of grey substance surrounding the central mass of white substance. The grey or cor- tical or cineritious substance of the brain is soft and pulpy, and more vascular than the white; on the sur- face of the cerebrum it is about the eighth of an inch in thickness ; in other situations it is placed in consi- derable masses, and covered by the white substance; the shade of its colour differs in different parts of the

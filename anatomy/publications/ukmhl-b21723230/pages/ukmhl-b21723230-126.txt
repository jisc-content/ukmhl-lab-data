108 these tendons to this canal: this slieath is weak oppo- site each articulation, but is very strong on the phalan- ges ; its anterior extremity is continuous with the inser- tion of the deep flexor tendon. Divide the flexor sub- limis and carpi radialis, and the three deep muscles will be partially exposed,â€”namely, the flexor digitorum pro- fundus, flexor pollicis longus, and nearly concealed by these, the pronator quadratus. Flexor Dioitorum . Profundus Perforaxs, arises fleshy from three superior fourths of the ante-, rior surface of the ulna, and from the internal half of the interosseous ligament; it sometimes receives a small Elip from the radius below ils tubercle ; it forms a thick muscle which descends along the middle and ulnar side of the forearm, and ends in four flat tendons; these pass beneath the annular ligament, enter the ligamentous sheaths on the fingers, pass through the slits in the su- perficial flexor tendons, and are inserted into the last phalanx of each finger. Use, to bend the last phalanx, and to co-operate with the superficial flexor muscle; this muscle is covered by those of the superficial layer, which have been described; the ulnar vessels, the me- dian and ulnar nerves also descend along it; and it (^vers the ulna, the interosseous ligament and vessels., .the pronator quadratus and the carpus, and on each fin- ger its tendon is superficial to that of the flexor sub- limis. Flexor Pollicis Longus, arises from the forepart of the radius, commencing narrow just below its tuber- cle, and ending within about two inches of the carpus, and also very frequently by a long and narrow tendinous and fleshy slip from the coronoid process; this at first looks like a distinct muscle; all the fibres descend ob- liquely forwards to a tendon, which passes beneath the annular ligament, then runs outwards between the two portions of the short flexor, and the two sesamoid tuber- cles at the extremity of the metacarpal bone; it then enters a strong ligamentous sheath, and is bound dowu by it as far as the last phalanx of the thumb, into the middle of which it is inserted. Use, to flex and adduct the different joints of the thumb upon the hand, and the latter upon (he forearm. This muscle is covered by the

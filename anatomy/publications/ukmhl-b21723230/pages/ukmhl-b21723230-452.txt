434 digastric muscle, above and behind it is a hole through which a vein and small artery pass ; this process is hol- lowed out into cells which communicate with the' tym- panum, it gives attachment to the sterno-mastoid muscle; the cerebral surface is deeply grooved for the lateral sinus. The petrous portion passes from the junction of the mastoid and squamous forwards and inwards into the base of the skull, it is of' a triangular form, the base behind and vei-y irregular, with a deep notch which assists the occipital bone in forming the foramen lace- rum poster! us; the apex is anterior, contiguous to the body of the sphenoid bone, and completing ■ndth it the foramen laceriim anterius, which in the recent state is filled up witli, cartilage; this bone is peculiarly ■ hard and rugged; on its inferior surface we remark in front of the foramen lacerum posterius a minute hole which leads to the cochlea, and is named the aqueduct of the cochlea; moie anteriorly is the styloid process which descends obliquely inwards and forwards, and gives at- tachment to three muscles ; it is surrounded at its base or root by a plate of bone most prominent anteriorl)' and externally, this is named the vaginal process, it sepa- rates the glenoid fossa from the carotid foramen; behind and outside the styloid process, betw^een it and the mas- toid, is the stylo-mastoid hole or the low-er end of the aqueduct of Fallopius; this transmits the portio dura or the facial nerve ; in front of the styloid process is the carotid hole w'hich leads into a canal that winds forwards, upwards, and inwards, and wFich opens within the cranium above the foramen lacerum anterius by the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, it transmits the carotid artery and branches of the sympathetic nerve; in front of the carotid hole is a flat rough surface to which the muscles of the palate are attached ; the apex of the petrous bone is very irreg’ular, it lies in the fora- men lacerum anterius, the internal opening of the ca- rotid canal is in it; into the angle between the petrous and squamous portions the spinous part of the sphenoid bone is wedged ; in this angle there are two holes se- parated by a thin lamina of bone, the upper transmits the tensor tympani muscle, the lower is the extremity of the bony part of the Eustachian tube.

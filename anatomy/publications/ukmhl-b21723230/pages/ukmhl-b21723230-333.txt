315 p 2 â– ' The Lingual Nerve, or the ninth pair, on es- caping from the condyloid foramen communicates with the eighth pair, the sympathetic, and the nervous arch or loop of the atlas; it is at first posterior to the vessels and nerves in this situation, it then descends along their outer side, soon turns forwards, and becomes super- ficial to them; it then takes the arched course of the digastric muscle across the neck, parallel but superficial to the lingual artery, and arriving at the side of the base of the tongue above the os hyoides, it passes above the mylo-hyoid muscle and lies on the middle constrictor and on the hyo-glossus, at the anterior edge of which it divides into several filaments; some of these plunge into the lingualis and genio-glossus mus- cles, others continue on to the point of the tongue, communicating with each other and supplying the muscular substance of this organ. As the lingual nerve is bending across the neck below the digastric tendon it sends off a considerable branch, the descendens colli, or noni; this nerve frequently receives a filament from the pneumo-gastric; it descends along the fore-part of the sheath of the carotid artery; about the middle of the neck it is joined by the internal descending branches of the cervical plexus, with which it forms a small tri- angular plexus, the branches of which pass to the omo and sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles; on the latter some filaments descend into the chest. Near the os hy- oides the lingual nerve sends some filaments to the con- strictors of the pharynx and stylo pharyngeus, also one to the thyro-hyoid muscle; on the surface of the hyo- glossus it gives off several branches to the surrounding muscles, some also communicate with the gustatory branch of the fifth pair; the lingual nerve then termi- nates chiefly in the genio-hyo-glossus muscle. SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL NERVES. There are eight cervical nerves, the first passes out above the atlas, and is named the sub-occipital, the

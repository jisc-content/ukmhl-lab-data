and the gracilis, and above the adductor brevis; its in- sertion is behind the vastus internus, and in front of the adductor magnus; this adductor is covered by the inte- guments and fascia superiorly, and by the sartorius and the femoral vessels inferiorly; it lies anterior to the two following muscles. Abductor Brevis, short, flat, and triangular, is situated posterior to the adductor longus and pectinaeus, and internal to the psoas; arises flat and tendinous from the anterior inferior surface of the pubis, between the symphysis and the thyroid hole; it soon ends in a fleshy belly, which passes outwards, backwards, and a little downwards, inserted by tendinous slips into the superior third of the internal root of the linea aspera, extending for about three inches below the lesser trochanter. The origin of this muscle is external to the gracilis, and concealed by the adductor longus and the pectinaeus; as it descends it is covered by these muscles, except a small portion near its insertion, which appears between them; this portion is posterior to the femoral and profunda vessels; its insertion is anterior to that of the adductor magnus; in the tendon of this ad- ductor one or two large openings frequently exist for the passage of some of the perforating arteries. Adductor Magnus, the longest and largest of the adductors, triangular, the base attached to the femur, the apex to the pelvis; arises chiefly fleshy ffom the anterior surface of the descending ramus of the pubis, external to the gracilis, also from the ramus of the ischium, and tendinous from the external border of the tuberosity of the latter ; the fibres pass outwards with difierent degrees of obliquity; those -which arise from the pubis ascend obliquely outwards, those from the ramus of the ischium pass outwards and do-wnwards, and those from the tuber ischii more directly down- Avards; inserted fleshy into the rough ridge which leads from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, tendinous and fleshy into the linea aspera, and by a long round tendon into the internal condyle of the femur. The superior edge of this muscle has a twisted appearance, it is nearly parallel to the quadratus femoris; several branches of the internal circumflex A'essels pass between

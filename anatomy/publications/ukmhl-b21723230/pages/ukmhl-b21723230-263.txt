2-1-5 sure; it also gives attachment to several muscular fibres. The muscles of the leg may be divided into those on the anterior, external, and posterior part. SECTION IV. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES ON THE ANTEKIOE, AND EXTERNAL PART ON THE LEG. The muscles on the fi3re-part of the leg are the ti- bialis anticus, extensor pollicis, extensor communis, and peronaeus tertius; the muscles on the outer side of the leg are the peronseus longus and brevis : almost all these muscles are connected to each other superiorly, so that they cannot he perfectly separated from each other ; they all adhere to and partly arise from the fascia of the leg, therefore, when exposed, they present a rough surface superiorly. Tibialis Anticus, is next the tibia, somewhat triangular, large and fleshy ajiove, tendinous below, arises tendinous and fleshy from the outer part of the two superior thirds of the tibia, from the head of the fibula, from the inner half of the interosseous liga- ment, from the fascia of the leg, and from the inter- muscular septa; the fibres descend obliquely inwards, end in a strong and flat tendon which crosses from the outer to the fore-part of the tibia, runs through a dis- tinct ring in the annular ligament, near the internal malleolus, passes forwards and inwards above the as- tragalus and naviculare, increases in breadth, and is in- serted into the inner side of the great cuneiform hone, also, by a tendinous slip, into the base of the first meta- tarsal bone. Use, to flex the ankle, to adduct the foot, and to raise its inner edge from the ground; to turn the toes inwards, also to support the leg when stand- ing, and prevent it bending backw-ards. This muscle is superficial through its whole length; the tendon, at its insertion, is partly concealed by the abductor and flexor pollicis brevis ; superiorly this muscle is external to the tibia; inferiorly it is anterior to it; the extensor communb, and extensor pollicis, the anterior tibial

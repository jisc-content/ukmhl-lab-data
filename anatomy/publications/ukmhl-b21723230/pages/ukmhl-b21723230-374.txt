3.5G pharynx and along the oesophagus as far as the cardiac orifice of the stomach, where it terminates in a fimbri- ated margin; from the external ear it extends along the meatus externus, and covers the raembrana-tym- pani; inferiorly also it is continued along the mucous lining of the urethra, vagina, and rectum; the cuticle serves to defend certain parts of the body from pressure, to protect its surface from contact, and to prevent evapo- ration. The rate mucosum is a thin vascular lamina, adhering to the cutis, connected to it by vessels, it has a. villous appearance, and is tinged with a mucous fluid, which presents different shades of colour in different situations and in different individuals; the peculiar complexion or colour of the body depends upon this secretion; in the negi o, it is very thick and black, wdiile the cuticle is transparent and the cutis vascular and red ; some anatomists divide the rete mucosum into two, and some even into three or four laminae. The cutis vera, dermis or chorion, is much more dense than either of the preceding laminae; it is very tough and strong, in some situations more so than in others; its internal surface is cellular, its external is smooth and very vascular, it is also highly sensible, particularly in some situations, as in the fingers and toes, where nu- merous nerves are distributed to it in the form of small conical or oval papillae; these are very distinct at the end of each finger, they are very vascular, and into each a nervous filament can be traced ; in these papillae the .sense of touch more particularly resides. The subcu- taneous cellular tissue is connected to the deep surface of the cutis, which is itself cellular; the cellular mem- brane is considered by some as a part of the integu- ments; in some parts of the body, particularly if ex- posed to pressure, the cells are filled with adeps, in other situations, where the parts are subject to motion, the cells are very loose, and only contain a fine serous exha- lation ; the former species of cellulai* membrane has been named adipose membrane, the latter reticular membrane.

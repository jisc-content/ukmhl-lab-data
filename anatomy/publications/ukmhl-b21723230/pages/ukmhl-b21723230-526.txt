508 so well supported by ligaments as that of the knee ; on the sides we have the lateral ligaments ; in front the ligament of the patella and the tendinous insertion of the extensor muscles ; behind the posterior ligament of Winslow; and more particularly the strong crucial li- gaments. Additional ligamentous bands are also oc- casionally seen. When the tibia is completely dislo- cated backwards into the ham, the ligamentous attach- ments of the patella either above or below must give way. The crucial and posterior ligaments are also torn. The flexor muscles of the leg, Avhich are attached to the tibia, will contribute to keep the bone in the luxated po- sition. (!!omplete forward dislocations of the tibia have occurred, but they are very rare. In such case all the ligaments of the joint must give way, and the heads of the gastrocnemii and popliteus muscles would also pro- bably suffer. OF DISLOCATION OF THE UPPER HEAD OF THE FIBULA. Luxation of the upper head of the fibula is usually the consequence of disease ; for the application of a force sufiicient to dislocate the bone is much more likely to break it. The action of the biceps flexor, the only mus- cle inserted into the fibula, could not alone produce this accident. When the head of the fibula is thrown back, the anterior ligament and the accessory fibres from the tendon of the biceps, with the synovial capsule, are rup- tured. Boyer mentions a case in which the whole fibula was driven directly upwards in consequence of a disloca- tion outwards of the ankle. OF dislocation of the tarsal extremity of THE TIBIA. The tibia may be dislocated at its tarsal extremity, backwards, forwards, or to either side. Luxation inwards is the most common. These accidents can be produced by external violence alone. When the tibia is luxated in- wards it is found resting on the inner side of the astra-

IGl nary; these connect it to the diaphrag'm and abdominal muscles, and the lesser omentum attaches it to the sto- mach and duodenum. The siispensory or falciform ligament is a fold of pe- ritonaeum attached anteriorly by its convex border to the linea alba, to the rectus muscle of the right side, and to the diaphragm ; it passes obliquely backwards, and to the right side, and is attached by its posterior or con- cave edge to the upper or convex surface of the liver, on which its laminae separate, and expand over each side of this organ; enclosed in the inferior edge of this fold is the obliterated umbilical vein, which substance in the adult is named the ligamenturn teres : this, which is enumerated as the second ligament of the liver, ascends from the umbilicus, obliquely backwards, and to the right side, and is inserted into a notch in the thin or anterior edge of the liver, which notch is the com- mencement of the umbilical or horizontal fissure of the liver. The right and left lateral ligaments are triangu- lar folds, connecting; the rig;ht and left lobes of the liver to the diaphragm: the left lateral ligament lies anterior to the cardiac orifice of the stomach ; the right lateral ligament is directly above the right kidney. The coro- nary ligament is situated at the upper extremity of the falciform process, and consists of two laminae of peri- tonaeum, which separate from each other, and connect the superior thick edge of the liver to the diaphragm; between the laminae of this process the liver is deprived of a serous covering, and is in contact with the diaphragm ; this space lies anterior to the inferior vena cava. The liver is of an irregular form; it is longer transversely than from before backwards; its posterior edge is very thick, and in contact with the diaphragm ; its anterior edge is thin, convex, and on a level with the edge of the right hypochondrium, and with the lower part of the epigastric region; two notches may be obseired in this edge; one below the falciform ligament, into which the round ligament or obliterated umbilical vein enters; the other corresponds to the gall bladder. The superior or anterior surface is smooth and con- vex, and divided by the suspensoryâ€™ ligament into a

170 Hglit and left iliac arteries. The abdominal aorta sends off the following branches: 1st, the two phrenic arte- ries ; 2d, the coeliac axis; 3d, the superior mesenteric ar- tery; 4th, the two renal arteries; 5th, the spermatic ar- teries ; 6th, the inferior mesenteric artery ; also four of five pair of lumbar arteries from its posterior part ; and lastly, from the angle of its division the middle sacral ar- tery descends. The right and left iliac arteries descend obliquely outwards and backwards; that of the right side is the longer of the two ; opposite each ilio-sacral articu- lation each common iliac artery divides into the internal and external iliac. external proceeds along the in- ner side of the psoas magmus, and passing beneath Pou- part’s ligament, becomes the femoral artery ; just above this ligament it sends off two branches, the epigastric and the circumflex ilii. The internal iliac artefy descends into the pehds, and gives off" several branches, which shall be noticed afterwards in the dissection of that ca- vity. The veins in the abdomen correspond to the arte- ries ; each external ilitic vein ascends along the inner side of the artery of the same name, and near the sa- crum is joined by the internal iliac vein, which ascends from the pelvis ; the union 6f these on each side form the common iliac veins ; each of these ascends behind its accompanying artery, and opposite the right side of the fourth or fifth lumbar vertebra these veins unite and form the inferior or as'cending A'ena cava ; the left com- mon iliac vein is longer than the right, and passes be- hind the right iliac artery. The vena cava ascends along the right side of the aorta, and receives the spermatic, renal, and lumbar veins ; it lies, inferiorly, on the right psoas muscle, and on the right crus of the diaphragm; superiorly, it inclines forw’ards and to the right side, and enters the fissure in the liver; here it receives the venm cavaa hepaticae ; it then passes through the opening in the tendon of the diaphragm, and arrives at the right auricle of the heart. On eaOh side of the abdominal aorta the $y??ipathetic nerves ma)" be seen ; they pass from the thorax into the abdomen, beneath the true ligamentum arcuatum, and then descend between the crus of the diaphragm and the psoas magnus on each side ; in this course they form three or four oval gan-

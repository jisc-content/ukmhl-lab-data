39 artery -nith its accompanying- nerves. The muscular fibres which cover the back and sides of the phai-ynx, aj-e named constrictor muscles; they are symmetri- cal, and overlap each other; the inferior being most superficial, the middle next, and the superior the deepest; the constrictor muscles of opposite sides have one common insertion into the middle tendinous line or raphe on the back part of the phai-jmx, which line is very strong and distinct superiorly, being inserted into the cuneiform process, but inferiorly it is weak and often indistinct. CoxsTiucTOR PiiARYNGis INFERIOR is somewhat square, arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage, from the inferior cornu and posterior part of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, external to the crico-thyroid and thyro-hyoid; the superior fibres ascend obliquely, and overlap the middle constrictor ; the inferior fibres run circularly and overlap the oesophagus ; inserted along with that of the opposite side into the middle line on the back of the pharynx; its origin is covered by the sterno-thyroid muscle and the thyroid gland : this mus- cle lies on the mucous membrane, except its superior fibres, which are separated from it by the middle constric- tor. The inferior lai-)-ngeal nerve passes beneath its lower edge, and the superior laiyrngeal beneath its upper. Constrictor Pharyngis Medius is of a trian- gular form, arises from the cornu and appendix of the os hyoides, also from the stylo-hyoid and thyro-hyoid ligaments; its fibres expand on the back of the pharynx, the superior ascend to the occipital bone, the middle run transversely, and the inferior descend beneath the lower constrictor, inserted into the mesial tendinous line or raphe, and into the cuneiform process. The lin- gual artery and hyo-glossus muscle are connected to the origin of this muscle, which part is separated from the inferior constrictor by the superior laryngeal nerve and cornu of the thyroid cartilage, and from the supe- rior constrictor by the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso-pharyngeal nerve; on dividing the edge of this muscle, the Styeo-piiaryngeus appears; it arises from the root of the styloid process, descends to the side of the pharj-nx, where it expands between the su-

429 is the nasal spine and the orifices of the frontal sinuses, its edges are cellular to unite to and communicate with the cells of the ethmoid bone ; along its margins are two foramina, the anterior and posterior orbital, they are common to this and to the ethmoid bone, the anterior transmits the nasal twig of the ophthalmic nerve and an- terior ethmoidal artery, the posterior, the posterior eth- moidal artery; on either side are the orbital processes smooth, concave, and triangular, the apex behind, pre- senting near the external angular process a deep pit for the lachrymal gland, and near the internal a slight de- pression for the cartilaginous pulley of the superior ob- lique muscle of the eye, instead of a depression there is sometimes a small spine: the cerebral surface of these processes is convex, but very uneven, marked by the brain and vessels; their posterior margins are thin, and cut obliquely to support the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. The processes of this bone, enumerated by ana- tomists, are 11, viz., 2 orbital, 4 angular, 2 superciliary, 2 temporal, and 1 nasal; the foramina are 9, viz., 1, the foramen coecum, 2 and 3, the frontal sinuses, between the nasal and internal angular processes, 4 and 5, the supraorbital, 6 and 7, the anterior, and 8 and 9 the posterior orbital; these last, as well as the foramen coecum, are often common to this and the ethmoid bone. The os frontis is joined to 4 bones of the cranium, viz., the two parietal, the sphenoid and ethmoid, and to 8 bones of the face, viz., the nasal, superior maxillary, la- chrymal, and malar. The stnrcture is thick towards the nasal protuberance and superciliary ridges, but very thin in the orbital plates ; it is composed of two com- pact laminae and an intervening diplo’e, by the absorp- tion of the latter and the greater separation of the plates, the cavities called the frontal sinuses are form- ed ; these do not exist in childhood, and in the adult their extent is very variable; they generally extend from the ethmoid notch upwards and outwnrds for one third of the superciliary arch, sometimes much further; they are generally separated‘by a septum; their use is not fully ascertained. This bone is deve- loped from two points of ossification, one in each fron- tal prominence from this the bone extends in rays

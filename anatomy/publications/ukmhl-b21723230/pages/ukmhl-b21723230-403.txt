385 the lower and back part of the right auricle ; it recei ves the middle sacral, the spermatic, the renal, and capsular, and lastly the hepatic and the phrenic veins. The vena porlcB receives the blood from all the abdominal viscera except the kidneys, bladder, and uterus ; a large vein commences on the back of the rectum, (hcemorrhoidal) ascends towards the mesocolon and becomes the inferior mesenteric vein which accompanies the artery of the same name ; about the second lumbar vertebra this unites with the superior mesenteric vein, which accompanies the artery of that name also ; behind the pancreas this trunk is joined by a very large vein, the splenic, which returns the blood from the spleen, and also receives the veins from the great and lesser curvatures of the stomach, from the duodenum and pancreas; this large vein passes transversely behind the pancreas and below the splenic artery; the vena portae is formed by the union of the splenic and mesenteric veins, in front of the aorta, and behind the pancreas ; it then ascends to the right side, enclosed in the lesser omentum and behind the hepatic artery and ductus choledochus ; in this course it receives small veins from the omentum, pancreas, and gall-blad- der ; at the transverse fissure it divides at right angles into a right and left branch, which pass horizontally for a short distance, and form what is termed the sinus o f the porta ; this rests on the lobulus caudatus ; these branches then enter the liver, and ramify through its substance along with the branches of the hepatic artery and duct, and surrounded by the capsule of Glisson. The vena portae has no valves, whereas all the veins of the extremities are furnished with these, also the super- ficial veins of the neck ; the deep veins of the neck, the vena azygos, and the pelvic veins, are deprived of valves ; the coats of the vena portae are more dense and fibrous than those of most other veins ; the femoral vein also possesses such a very dense structure, that when divided it will often remain open like an artery. s

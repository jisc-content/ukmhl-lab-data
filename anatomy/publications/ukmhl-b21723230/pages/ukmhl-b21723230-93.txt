anterior or large division of the mitral valve ; the ventri- cle is smooth in the vicinity of this opening. The ante- rior division of the mitral, and the left of the tricuspidal valves are supposed to be larger than the other portions, for the purpose of preventing any blood flowing from the auricle or ventricle into the aorta or pulmonary artery, until the ventricle is fully distended. The aorta arises from the left ventricle in the same manner as the pulmo- nary arter}' from the right; three semilunar valves also proceed from this orifice into the aorta, stronger, but similar in structure and in function to those in the pul- monary artery; the corpora arantii in particular are larger and firmer in the aortic valves; external to each semilunar valve, the aorta is dilated into a small sinus; these three are named the sinuses of Morgagni, or lesser sinuses of the aorta. The aorta at its origin is covered by the pulmonary artery ; it ascends obliquely forwards and to the right, as high as on a level with the cartilages of the 2d rib of each side; it then passes backwards, and to the left side ; and lastly descending as low as the 4th dorsal vertebra, it becomes closely attached to the spine : this portion of the aorta is called the arch, at the termination of which this vessel receives the name of thoracic or descending aorta, which descends through the posterior mediastinum, as was already stated; the arch of the aorta is divided into the ascending, the trans- verse, and the descending; the fiirst is the longest portion, and in general is so much dilated at the upper part as to have received the name of the great sinus; this ascend- ing portion is within the pericardium, covered at first by the pulmonarj' artery; it afterwards lies between this ves- 1 sel and the vena cava ; from the commencement of this, 1 the two coronary arteries arise; the middle or transverse * portion of the arch lies above the pericardium, and in front of the trachea; from it arise the innominate, left ca- I rotid and left subclavian ; the descending portion bends behind the root of the left lung, and is connected to the pulmonary artery by the remains of the ductus arterio- sus ; through the arch of the aorta, the right pulmonary I artery, left bronchus and left recurrent nerve pa.ss.

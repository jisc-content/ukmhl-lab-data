stricter and external carotid, and it lies on the superior constrictor, internal carotid, sympathetic and par vagum; the glosso-pharyngeal nen-e winds round it. SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE NECK. The arteries which are met with in dissecting the neck are the caiotid and subclavian of each side, and their several branches; the veins are the external and internal jugular and subclavian; the nerves are the gustatory branchâ€™of the 5th, the 8th, and the 9th pair, the sympathetic and the anterior branches of the eight cervical and first dorsal spinal nerves. The right caro- tid artery arises from the arteria innominata, behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation ; the left carotid arises from the upper part of the arch of the aorta; in other respects these arteries are similar; both as- cend by the side of the trachea and larynx, surrounded by a sheath of cellular membrane, on the fore part of which are seen the branches of the descendens noni nerve; behind the sheath lies the sympathetic, and within it are the jugular veins, lying to the outside of the artery and the par vagum neiv^e, between, and ra- ther behind both these vessels; opposite the os hyoides each carotid divides into two branches, viz. the internal and external; the internal carotid artery is the larger branch, lies deeper in the neck, and more external; it ascends along the fore part of the transverse processes of the vertebrae to the base of the cranium, enters this cardty, through the foramen caroticum in the temporal bone, and is distributed to the brain. The external carotid artery ascends towards the parotid gland, being crossed by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and by the lingual and portio dura nerves; in this course it gives off several branches, viz. the superior thyroid, lin-

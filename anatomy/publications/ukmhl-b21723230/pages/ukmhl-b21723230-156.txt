138 deep fasciae of the abdomen ; divide the fascia transver- salis from the spine of the ilium towards the rectus muscle; dissect it carefully down from the peritonaeum, then push up this membrane, together wdth the caecum or sigmoid flexure of the colon, out of the iliac fossa, to which they are connected by very loose cellular mem- brane ; we thus obtain a view of the internal surface of Poupart’s ligament, and of the parts which pass beneath it, and which naturally fill the space or cavity of the crural arch : first observe the fascia transversalis attached to the inner lip of the ilium and to Poupart’s ligament from the spine of that bone, as far as the pubis, into the linea innominata of which it is inserted; here also it is inseparably joined to the conjoined tendons of the internal oblique and transverse muscles : as this fascia is passing anterior to the iliac or femoral vessels, a portion of it extends beneath Poupart’s ligament, in front of these vessels, so as to form the anterior part of their sheath; this process of the fascia transversalis soon be- comes thin and indistinct, and is lost in the cribriform part of the fascia lata. The fascia iliaca is a tolerably strong aponeurosis; it covers the iliac and psoas mus- cles, passes behind the iliac vessels, and adheres to the upper margin of the pelvis; externally it is connected to the inner edge of the ilium, and inferiorly it is attached to Poupart’s ligament, and to the fascia transversalis, from the spine of the ilium as far inwards as the iliac artery; here it presents a semilunar edge, separates from Poupart’s ligament, and from the fascia transversalis, passes behind the femoral vessels, forms the posterior part of the sheath, adheres to the pubis, and to the capsule of the hip joint, and is connected to the pubic or pectinaeal portion of the fascia lata. The fascia transversalis and iliaca may be compared to a funnel, containing in the superior wide portion the peritonmum and its contents, and enclosing in the inferior narrow part, or pipe, thd femoral vessels, and one or two hnn- phatic glands; of this funnel the fascia transversalis forms the anterior, and the fascia iliaca the posterior wall; these fasciae may be now seen to be perfectly con- tinuous with each other, between the vessels and the spine of the ilium; different names only being applied

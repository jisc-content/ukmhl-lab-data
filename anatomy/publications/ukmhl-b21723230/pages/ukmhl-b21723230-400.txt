382 ture ; some veins are said to commence from cells, as in the spleen and corpora cavernosa penis ; we shall describe the veins then as proceeding from the extreme parts of the body towards the centre or towards the heart; and 1st, The veins of the head and neck ; the small arteries w'hich ramify on the side and fore-part of the scalp are accompanied each by two veins ; these all terminate in the temporal veins which sink into the parotid gland anil there join the internal maxillary vein, which is formed by the confluence of the several small veins which accom- pany the branches of the internal maxillary artery ; the union of these two veins is the commencement of the ex- ternal jugular vein, which descends a little backwards nearly parallel to the fibres of the platysma, across the sterno-mastoid muscle, and at a little distance above the clavicle enters the subclavian vein, or some of its branches; near the angle of the jaw this vein receives a branch from the facial vein, and in its course dowm the neck it is joined by several cutaneous branches ; it also not unfrequently communicates with the internal jugular vein by one or two small branches near the os hyoides. The internal jugular vein commences in the foramen lacerum posterius basis cranii, from the termination of the lateral sinus, it descends along the outer side of the carotid artery, receives the facial, laryngeal, and several muscular veins, and opposite the sternal end of the cla- vicle joins the subclavian vein. The veins of the upper extremity are superficial and deep, the superficial are the cephalic, basilic, and median. The cephalic vein commences on the outer and back part of the carpus from the junction of the several dorsal veins of the hand, it ascends along the radial side of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, is there joined by the median cephalic, it then continues to ascend along the outer side of the biceps ; near the shoulder it turns for- wards and passes towards the clavicle between the pec- toral and deltoid muscles, and then sinks deep to join the axillary vein. The basilic vein commences near the lower end of

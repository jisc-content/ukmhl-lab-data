282 along the aqueduct of Sylvius, divide the valve of Vieus- sens and the cavity of the fourth ventricle will be ex- posed ; this is directed obliquely downwards and back- wards, between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata; it is bounded anteriorly by the pons Va- rolii, in the median line of which is a narrow fissure, the calamus scriptorius, from each side of which a few white lines pass off to join the auditory ners'e; laterally by the processes fron> the testes and by the crura cere- belli; superiorly by the valve of Vieussens; posteriorly by the cerebellum, and inferiorly by the reflection of the arachnoid membrane, and of the pia mater from the inferior surface of the cerebellum to the back of the spinal cord; the pia mater is here peculiarly dense, and it sends a small process into the lower part of this cavity, (the choroid plexus of ilie fourth ventricle,) which is loaded with tortuous vessels, and frequently presents a small number of reddish granular bodies. Raise either hemisphere of the cerebrum; from its inferior surface, just below the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus, a thick, white fasciculus may be observed descending obliquely backwards and inwards; this is the crus cerebri; fibrous and white on the sur- face, each crus internally contains cineritious substance of a very dark colour (locus niger;) the crura cerebri converge as they descend, and end in the upper extre- mity of the pons Varolii; the third ventricle is between them, and the tractus opticus of each side surrounds them. The crura cerebri and the following substance can be better examined when the brain is removed from the subject, and the base placed uppermost. The pons Varolii is somewhat square, it is placed obliquely on the cuneiform process, between the cerebrum' and cerebellum ; the fourth ventricle, the aqueduct of Syl-'^ vius and the tubercula quadrigemina, are on its supe- rior and posterior surface ; its inferior and anterior sur- face rests on the bone, and is grooved longitudinally by the basilar artery: its superior extremity receives the crura cerebri, w'hich it surrounds like a ring, hence it is sometimes called the annular protuberance; the crura cerebelli are attached to its sides, and the me-

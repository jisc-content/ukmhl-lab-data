359 The external carotid artery ascends obliquely back- wards to the fore-part of the meatus auditorius, covered by the skin, platysma, and fascia, also, by the lingual nen’e, digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, the parotid gland and portio dura nerve; it lies superficial to the in- ternal carotid, stylo-pharyngeus, and stylo-glossus mus- cles, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland ; it gives off the following arteries, anteriorly, the superior thyroid, lingual, and labial; posteriorly the mus- cular, auricular, and occipital; superiorly, the pharyngeal, transverse facial, temporal, and internal maxillary. The superior thyroid artery arises opposite the cornu of the thyroid cartilage, descends obliquely forwards and inwards beneath the sterno-thyroid, and onio-hyoid mus- cles, and sends off the following branches:—1st, the superficial, distributed to the integuments and superficial muscles ; 2d, the laryngeal, accompanying the superior laryngeal nerv'e between the os hyoides and thyroid car- tilage, and distributed to the muscles and mucous mem- brane of the larynx ; 3d, hyoidean, small and irregular, to the lower border of the os hyoides and adjacent mus- cles ; and 4th, superior thyroid, is distributed to the thy- roid gland. The lingual artery arises immediately above the preceding ; it ascends tortuously and obliquely forwards and inwards, above the os hyoides to the base of the tongue, between the hyo and the genio-hyo-glossi mus- cles, and then runs horizontally forwards towards the tip of the tongue; it gives off the following branches, 1st, hyoidean, small and irregular ; 2d, dorsalis lingiue, which ascends to the dorsum of the tongue, and is lost on the mucous membrane, near its base, also on the velum and fauces ; 3d, sublingual, passes forwards and outwards to the sublingual gland, mylo-hyoid muscle, and mucous membrane of the mouth ; and 4th, ranine, which continues along the lirigualis muscle to the tip of the tonsme. The labial or external maxillary artery arises op- posite the qs-hyoides, ascends obliquely forwards be- hind the digastric and between the sub-maxillary gland and the base of the jaw, turns round the latter ante-

147 ing a verj' important and remarkably folded or plaited prc* cess named the mesentery. From the inferior surface of the mesentery the peritonaeum extends into either iliac region, and descends into the pelvis in the middle; it serves to connect the caecum in the right, and the sigmoid curve of the colon in the left iliac fossa ; in the pelvis the peritonaeum descends around the rectum, forming the process named the meso-rectum ; opposite the lower third of the sacrum, it is reflected to the lower and back part of the bladder, and in the female to the upper and back part of the . vagina, from which it ascends on the uterus, and forms on each side of this organ the broad ligament which supports the Fallopian tube and the ovary ; the peritonaeum is then reflected from the fore- part of the uterus to the back of the bladder, ascends, both in Uie male and female, along the posterior sur- face and sides of this viscus to its superior fundus, from /which, and from the iliac fossa, it is continued to the abdominal muscles; forms the inguinal pouches, and may then be traced on the inner surface of the recti and transverse muscles up to the umbilicus, where the sac was opened. The different folds which the peritonaeum forms in this course are termed proces- ses, the principal of which, in addition to the ligaments of the several organs, which shall be noticed in the de- scription of the latter, are, the lesser omentum, the great omentum, the splenic omentum, the colic omentum, the appendices epiploicae, the transverse, and the right and left lumbar meso-colons, the mesentery, meso-caecum, and meso-rectum. The lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum consists of two laminae, which extend from the transverse fissure of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and to the upper part of the duodenum ; it contains between its layers the vessels of the liver, viz. the hepatic artery to the left side, the ductus choledochus to the right, and the vena porta behind and between both ; at its con- nexion to the stomach, it encloses the coronary vessels of this organ ; the lesser omentum lies anterior to the foramen of Winslow ; this omentum seldom contains much fat. The great ox gastro-colic omentum also consists of two II2

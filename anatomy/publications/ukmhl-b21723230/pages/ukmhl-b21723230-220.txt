202 oval form, flattened on each side, also a little on the back part beneath the epididymis ; it is suspended rather ob- liquely, the superior extremity being; directed forwards and outwards, the inferior backwards and inwards. Bent like an arch, along the posterior surface of each testicle, is the epididymis, long and narrow, large above (globus major), narrow in the middle (body), and again enlarged below (globus minor), attached to the testicle above by vessels, and in the rest of its extent by the reflected layer of the tunica vaginalis, closely on the internal, but very loosely on the external or femoral side ; from its in- ferior extremity the vas deferens proceeds, and thence ascends along its internal side. Divide the tunica albu- ginea anteriorly and we obsen'e the testicle to be com- posed of a soft greyish pulpy substance, which, when opened out a little, and floated in water, is found to con- sist of numerous fine tortuous shreds or vessels of deli- cate texture, loosely connected to each other ; some are of considerable length, and with a little care may be drawn out of the gland to the extent of two or three feet ; they are placed" in packets or fasciculi, wâ€™hich are separated from each other by fibrous bands or septa, which are derived from the tunica albuginea, and which may now be seen to pass in considerable numbers through the gland towards the back part, where they join the corpus highmorianum : this name is applied to a long fold or process of the tunica al- buginea, w'hich projects into the back part of the gland ; it consists of two laminae, between which the vessels and nerves of the testicle are enclosed ; this process is broader above than below, is perforated in the former situation by the excretory ducts of the testicle ; to its anterior border and sides are attached the sepimenta or processes of the tunica albuginea be- fore mentioned. From the several collections of small tubes, -which are disposed between these bands or septa, about twelve or twenty larger vessels may be seen to proceed nearly in parallel lines towards the back part of the gland ; these are the tubuli recti; they pierce the corpus highmorianum, and if one lamina of this process be raised off they -will be seen entangled

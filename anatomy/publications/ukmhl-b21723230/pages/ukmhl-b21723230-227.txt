209 the apex of each being attached to the ischium and pu- bis, the base supporting the glans ; they are round ex- ternally, flattened towards each other ; a wide and deep groove exists between them inferiorly, which contains the urethra, and a more superficial one superiorly, in which the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis run. The erection of the penis during life is caused by a greater quantity of blood than usually circulates through this organ being propelled by an increased action of the arteries into the small vessels of the corpora caver- nosa penis : anatomists are not agreed as to the exact structure of the corpora cavernosa, or as to the proxi- mate cause of their erection during life, or how the blood is circumstanced during that condition ; some con- sider that the arteries pour their blood into the cells of the cellular tissue which surrounds them, so as to cause their distension, and that from these the blood is slowly and gradually absorbed by the veins ; others conceive that the arteries directly communicate with the veins, and that these latter vessels are tortuous and coiled to such a de- gree as to retard the course of the return of the blood, and so cause the distention and consequent erection o-f the whole organ. The Urethra extends from the neck of the bladder to the extremity of the penis ; it is lined by a fine mucous membrane, which is continuous posteriorly with the mu- cous membrane of the bladder, and anteriorly with the thin integument, which is reflected from the inside of the prepuce, over the glans penis, as far as, and even within, the orifice of the urethra. This membrane is covered at first by the prostate gland, and this portion of the canal is called the prostatic portion of the urethra ; the next succeeding portion is covered by the compressores ure- thrae muscles, by the triangular ligament, and by a pecu- liar reddish or spongj' looking cellular tissue, which con- tains several small blood-vessels, chiefly veins ; this part of the urethra is called the membranous portion; the remainder of the canal is covered by a cellular and vas- cular substance of a dark red or purple colour, named the corpus spongiosum urethrae, which commences in the bulb, and ends in the glans penis ; this portion of the

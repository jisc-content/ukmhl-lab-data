184 the posterior triangular division contains the lower ex- tremity of the rectum, surrounded by the cutaneous and deep sphincters, also on each side of this intestine a considerable quantity of fat filling up the space between the side of the rectum and the obturator internus muscle and fascia, which space is bounded superiorly, that is, separated from the pelvis by the levator ani muscle, and inferiorly is closed by the fascia and integuments ; the fat is from two to three inches in depth ; when this mass is dissected out of the space which it fills, the le- vator ani muscle will be seen extended from the inter- nal surface of the pelvis to either side c.f the rectum, and to the coccyx, so as to form a partition between the pelvis and the perinaeum.â€”First examine the mus- cles in the anterior part of the perinaeum; the erector or compressor penis is most external, and lies on the eras penis; the accelerator urinae extends along the middle of the perinaeum, attached to its_ fellow' along the raphe, and covering the urethra; the transversalis perinaei connects the posterior extremities of these mus- cles. Immediately in front of the rectum, in the mid- dle line, and behind, but connected to the bulb of the urethra, is a small, white, tendinous spot, composed of condensed cellular tendinous substance; into this many of the perinaeal muscles are inserted; it is therefore called the central point of the perinaaum, or the common point of insertion to the muscles of the perinaeum. Erector, or Compressor Penis, long and flat, narrow at each extremity, broader in the middle, arises tendinous and fleshy from the inner surface of the tuber ischii, and from the insertion of the great or inferior sacro-sciatic ligament, the fibres proceed fonvards, up- wards, and inwards,.adhering to the edges of the rami of the pubis and ischium, and covering the crus penis. The fleshy fibres terminate in a tendinous expansion, which inclines forwards, upivards, and outwards, and is inserted into the fibrous membrane of the corpus ca- vernosum or crus penis. Use ; to draw' down the penis; it also contributes to the erection or distension of this organ by propelling the blood into it, and by tbe com- pression of the veins against the bone preventing tbe free return of this fluid through these vessels.

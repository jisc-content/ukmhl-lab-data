159 and which space admits of the more easy distension of the intestine; the muscular coat is not so strong as on the duodenum, but more evidently consists of two sets of fibres : the longitudinal are the most superficial, they are very pale and indistinct, except along the anterior or convex side of the intestine; the circular fibres lie be- neath these; they are more distinct, but also very pale : no fibre passes perfectly round the tube. The mucous coat is paler than in the stomach, and is thrown into numerous folds, particularly in the jejunum; these folds are smaller and less numerous in the ileum: the muscular coat in the latter intestine also is paler and weaker than in the former. The folds of mucous mem- brane, called valvulaj conniventes, are larger in the je- junum than in the duodenum or ileum ; in the first they will be found to be a quarter of an inch deep in some situations; in others, however, much less; they form arches which encircle about three-fourths of the intes- tine, and end, some in a point, others are forked or pass off obliquely into adjacent folds: these valves are of use in delaying the food in its passage along the canal, thus affording to the absorbents a better opportunity to imbibe all the nutritious matter or the chyle it may con- tain; in proportion also as the intestine becomes dis- tended, these valves become more tense, and project into the canal, so as to separate the food into smaller portions, and thus expose the entire mass to the action of the absorbents: on each of these valves are a number of small conical projections called villi: when these are examined through a magnifying glass, small pores are obsenâ€™able; these are the mouths of the lacteal or ab- sorbent vessels. Very small mucous glands are attached to the external surface of the mucous membrane of the intestine throughout its whole length: larger glands may be noticed in different situations, some scattered singly, others collected into clusters; the former, or the glandulte solitariae, or Brunneri, are most distinct in the duodenum; the latter, or the grandulae aggregate or Peyeri, are most obvious in the ileum, particularly near its termination. 3d, The large intestine in some situa- tions, as has been already observed, is but partially co- vered by peritonaeum; this membrane is more loosely

115 Flexor Pollicis Brevis, consists of two portions, between which is the tendon of the flexor longue ; one head, the external or anterior arises from the inside of the annular ligament, and from the trapezium and scap- hoid bones, passes outwards, and is inserted into the ex- ternal sesamoid bone and base of the first phalanx of the thumb ; the 2d, or internal or posterior arises from the os magnum, and the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger; it also passes outwards, distinct from the other at first, but afterwards united to it, and is inserted into the internal sesamoid bone, and base of the first pha- lanx. Use, to flex the first phalanx and metacarpal bone on the carpus : this muscle is concealed by the two for- mer, and by the first lumbricalis; it covers the two first interossei muscles, and the tendon of the flexor carpi ra- dialis ; its outer edge is connected to the opponens pollicis, and the internal to the adductor. Adductor Pollicis, triangular and broad, arises fleshy from three-fourths of the anterior surface of the third metacarpal bone, the fibres pass outwards over the second metacarpal, and converging are inserted into the inner side of the root of the first phalanx of the thumb, along with part of the last muscle ; its name denotes its use. This muscle at its origin is covered anteriorly by the deep flexor tendons and by the lumbricales; its inser- tion is covered by the following muscle, which may be best seen from behind. Abductor Indicis, also triangular, arises tendinous and fleshy from the metacarpal bone of the forefinger, and from one half of that of the thumb; its fibres extend obliquely inwards and fonvards, end in a tendon which passes by the outer side of the first joint of the fore- finger, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of its first phalanx. Use, to separate the forefinger from the others, or to adduct the thumb. This muscle is super- ficial posteriorly; anteriorly it is covered by that last described ; the radial artery passes between its two heads or origins : this muscle is similar to, and may be regarded as one of the posterior interossei, like these also its insertion joins that of the common extensor tendon. In the middle of the palm of the hand are seen four small muscles.

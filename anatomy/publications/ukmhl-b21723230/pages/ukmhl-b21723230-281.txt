PART II. CHAPTER I. ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM MAY BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR PRINCI- PAL PARTS, THE BRAIN, THE SPINAL CORD, THE NERVES, AND THE GANGLIONS. SECTION I. - DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. The braia is subdivided into three portions, cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata ; these are, however, so intimately connected, that it is difficult to mark the exact limits of each. Dinde the scalp from one ear across the vertex to the other ; reflect one flap over the face, the other over the back of the neck ; make a circular cut ivith the saw through the cranium on a level with the cartilage of the ear on each side, anteriorly about an inch above the superciliary arches, and posteriorly a little below the tubercle of the os occipitis. It is only necessary to saw through the outer table of the bones, the eleva- tor, or a few smart strokes with the claw of the ham- mer will then suffice to crack the internal table, (indeed the cranium may be opened by the hammer alone: this plan, however, injures the bones so much as to

ligament and a quantity of adipose membrane are con- nected ; this cotyloid cavity looks outwards, downwards, and forwards, the upper and outer portion, by which the weight is transmitted to the thigh, is the deepest, it is shallow at the lower and internal part. The Pelvis, which is thus made up of the ossa inno- minata, the sacrum, and coccyx, may next be examined on its external and internal surface ; anteriorly and ex- ternally it presents the symphisis and crests of the pubes ; the ileo-pectinaeal eminences ; and beneath these the acetabula and the thyroid holes, more laterally is the dorsum of the ilium, marked by its cun'ed lines, posteriorly the sacral spines occupy the median line; external to these are the sacral foramina, beyond which is a rough surface for the attachment of ligaments and muscles ; and lastly the great sacro-sciatic notch, which is bounded by the sacrum, ilium, and ischium. The superior circumference or base of the pelvis, is inclined upwards and forwards, is formed on each side by the crest of the ilium, posteriorly by the promontory of the sacrum, on each side of which is a deep notch, which is filled by muscles, anteriorly by the iliac spines, ilio pubal eminences, the intervening grooves, and by the ossa pubis; the lower or perinceal circumference or strait of the pelvis, is directed downwards and back- wmds, and bounded by the rami of the pubes, the rami and tubera ischii, and by the sacrum and coccyx, this strait presents three great notches : 1st, the arch of the pubis, triangular, and placed beneath the symphysis, the 2d and 3d are placed between the sacrum and os innominatum, very large in the dried bones, but in the recent state they are divided by the sciatic lig-aments, each into two, the great.or superior, the lesser or infe- rior sacro-sciatic notch ; the former transmits the pyri- form muscle, the glutaeal, sciatic, and pudic vessels and nerves, the latter the tendon of the obturator mus- cle, and the pudic vessels and neiwes. The internal surface of the pelvis is divided into two by the promi- nent line before mentioned, the linea ilio pectinma, which leads from the spine of the pubis to the promon- tory of the sacrum, helow this line is the true pelvis, above it is the false pelvis, which is rather a portion of

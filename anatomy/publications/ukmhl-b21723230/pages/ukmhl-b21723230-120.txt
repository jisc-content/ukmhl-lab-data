102 distributed to the muscles of the forearm and hand; 5tli, the musculospiral, or radial nerve, descends between the second and third heads of the triceps, and winds round the hack part of the humerus, supplying' the tri- ceps in its course ; it next runs spirally forwards to the forepart of the bone, between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus : it then descends over the forepart of the elbow joint to the muscles of the forearm, where we shall trace it afterwards; 6th, the circumflex, or arti- cular nerve, accompanied by the posterior circumflex artery, passes out of the axilla betwelen the long head of the triceps and the neck of the humerus, winds round the latter beneath the deltoid muscle to which its branches are distributed.—See Anatomy of Nen’ous System. SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE FOREARM AND HAND, Remove the integuments from the front and back of the forearm and hand, and the investing fascia will be exposed, together with the cutaneous nerves and veins : the latter may be noticed first. The basilic vein is seen to arise by small branches from the sides of the little finger, one of which is named salvatella; it then ascends along the ulnar side of the foreann, receiving in this course small branches from the front and back of the arm and passing anterior to the internal condyle, it is joined by the median basilic; it then ascends dong the inner side of the arm, passes beneath tfie fascia, and joins one of the deep brachid veins; sometimes it con- tinues in a superficid course to the axilla, and joins the axillary vein. The cephalic vein commences by several smdl branches about the thumb and back of the hand; it ascends along the radial side of the forearm, passes over the bend of the elbow, is joined by the median / cephdic, and then ascends along the outside of the arm t to the claviclte. The median vein arises by small branches a

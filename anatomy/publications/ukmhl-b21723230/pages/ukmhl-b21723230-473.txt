455 tinguislied by a transverse ridge or crest near the root of the great wing of the sphenoid bone, from this it extends to the tuberosity of the maxillarj' bone, and is bounded externally by the ramus of the lower jaw. The Pterygo-Maxillary Fossa is a very narrow space, it is enclosed between the pterygoid processes behind and the tuberosity of the maxillary bone before, it is bounded internally by the nasal lamella of the palate bone, which separates it from the nose ; it is immediately below and behind the orbit, with which it communicates by the spheno maxillary fissure, it also communicates with the palate by the posterior palatine canals, and with the nose by the spheno palatine hole, it also leads into the tempo- ral and zygomatic fossae. The Extremities are two superior, and two inferior. The inferior extremity is divided into three parts, the thigh, leg, and foot; the thigh contains but one bone, the femur. The Femur is the longest bone in the system, it con- sists of the body or shaft and two extremities ; the body is slightly twisted, thick above, very broad below, con- tracted and nearly cylindrical in the centre, arched and smooth before and concave behind, with a sharp rough ridge down the centre, named the linea aspera, this ex- tends along the middle third of the bone, parallel to its axis and divides above and below into two ridges, these pass superiorly one to each trochanter, that to the inner being the shorter ; and inferiorly one to either condyle ; these inferior divisions separate further and enclose a flat triangular space, the popliteal; this line is very prominent about the centre and presents two lips and an interstice, for the attachment of different muscles ; the anterior con- vex surface of the femur is broader towards either end than in the centre, it is a little concave superiorly, the sides are slightly flattened, and the external is somewhat broader than the internal, particularly above ; above the middle of the linea aspera one or two holes may be seen to enter obliquely upwards, these transmit the nutritious or the medullar)' vessels of the bone ; to the linea aspera in the middle of the thigh, the vastus extern us, the adductor tendons, and the vastus intenius are attached, to the su-

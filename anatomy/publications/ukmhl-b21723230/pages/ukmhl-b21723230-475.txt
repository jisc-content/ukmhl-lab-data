457 rotators of the limb, namely, the pyriform, gemelli and obturators ; the summit of the trochanter is thick and rough, the glutaeus medius is inserted into it, the an- terior edge is broad, and gives attachment to the gluteeus minimus, into the posterior, which is round and thick, the quadratus femoris is inserted. The lesser trochanter is a conical projection at the posterior and inner side of the shaft, and considerably below the great trochanter; it looks backwards and inwards, the tendons of the psoas and iliac muscles are inserted into it behind its apex, a bursa is connected to it anteriorly. The inferior or tibial end of the femur is very large and broad, and di- vide into two eminences or condyles which are separated posteriorly by a deep notch; the condyles articulate with the tibia; the external is larger, and projects more for- ward than the internal, its articulating surface is also broader, and ascends higher, externally it is rough, and presents a tuberosity which gives attachment to the ex- ternal lateral ligament of the knee joint; this is less prominent than the internal tubercle, beneath this tu- bercle is a groove which receives the tendon of the pop- litaeus muscle in the flexed position of the joint; inter- nally this condyle presents a rough surface, towards the posterior part of which the anterior crucial ligament is inserted, it is verj' convex behind, flat before, and broad below. The internal condyle is narrower, less promi- nent before but prolonged more behind ; it is also longer than the external, and therefore descends lower when the femur is vertical, but both are nearly on a level when the bone is in its ordinary oblique direction ; on its inner side is the tubercle for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the knee and for the ad- ductor tendon; to its outer side, which is rough, the anterior crucial ligament adheres; both condyles are more convex behind than before, they are separated posteriorly by a deep uneven notch, which lodges the crucial ligaments and is deprived of articular cartilage ; anteriorly they are continued into each other, and unite in a pulley-like surface which is convex from above downwards, and concave from side to side, higher exter- nally than internally; this trochlea is chiefly formed on the external condyle, it supports the patella: the femur X

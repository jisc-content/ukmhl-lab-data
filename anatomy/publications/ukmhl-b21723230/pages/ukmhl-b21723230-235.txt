217 thigh, and from the upper part of the leg; several cu- taneous nerves, veins, and lymphatic vessels are met with in this dissection; the nerves are branches of the lumbar plexus, and of the anterior crural nerve; they pierce the fascia lata near Poupart’s ligament, and de- scend chiefly along the anterior and outer side of the thigh. The cutaneous veins are branches of the in- ternal saphena vein; this vessel will he found, in dis- secting the leg and foot, to commence at the inner side of the latter, and to ascend along the internal part of the leg and knee to the inner and fore-part of the thigh, along which it continues its course towards the groin; and about an inch and a half below Poupart’s ligament it pierces the fascia lata, and joins the femoral vein. In this course the saphena vein receives several cuta- neous branches, and, in general, just before it ends in the femoral it is joined by one or two large veins from the outer and fore-part of the thigh, and by some small- er branches from the abdominal parietes; some cuta- neous branches from the anterior crural, and lumbar nerves accompany this vein in its course along the thigh. Beneath the integuments the thigh is invested by the superficial fascia, which is prolonged around it from the parietes of the abdomen; in the groin this fascia is thick and laminated, and closely connected to the fascia lata ; but inferiorly and posteriorly it is thin and loose, and difl’ers but little from the ordinary sub-cu- taneous cellular tissue. This fascia may be easily de- tached from the fascia lata of the thigh, except in the groin ; in attempting to raise it in this region we ex- pose the superficial inguinal glands ; these are eight or ten in number; five or six of them are placed parallel to Poupart’s ligament, some above, others below it; two or three are situated lower down in the srroin than O these, near the termination of the saphena vein; these last glands lie on the fascia lata; they are larger than the former, and are parallel to the saphena vein. Through these conglobate inguinal glands the superfi- cial absorbents of the lower extremities pass ; also those from the external parts of generation. Beneath the fascia lata, and close to the femoral vessels, are the deep-seated inguinal glands; they are small, and only JL

297 nerves, and is distributed to the inferior surface of the cerebellum. The basilar artery ascends along the me- dian groove in the pons, and at its superior edge divides into four branches, two for each side, viz. the superior cerebellar artery and the posterior cerebral ; these are distributed as their names imply : the posterior cerebral artery of each side is joined by the posterior branch of each internal carotid; this communication completes the circle of Willis. Each internal carotid artery winds obliquely forwards, upwards, and inwards, through the tortuous canal in the temporal bone, and through the cavernous sinus ; beneath the anterior clinoid process it perforates the dura mater, and rises perpendicularly to the base of the brain between the second and third nerves, and then divides into three branches, the anterior, mid- dle, and posterior; before it thus divides it gives off, first, small branches to the cavernous sinus and to the dura mater, and next the ophthalmic artery, which entere the orbit through the optic hole and is distributed to the eye and its appendages. The anterior branch of the carotid is also named the anterior cerebral artery, or the artery of the corpus callosum; this passes forwards and inwards, and is joined to the corresponding artery of the opposite side by a short branch, (the anterior communicating ar- tery,) it then ascends and runs along the upper surface of the corpus callosum, distributing its branches to the inner surface of each hemisphere ; the middle branch of the carotid is very large, it passes upwards and outwards deep in the fissure of Sylvius, and is distributed to the anterior and middle lobes of the cerebrum ; the posterior branch of the carotid is named the posterior communi- cating artery ; it is small, passes backwards, and joins the jxwterior cerebral artery ; this forms the side of the cir- cle of Willis.â€”(See Anatomy of Vascular System.) The vessels of the brain are accompanied by numerous fine filaments of the sympathetic nerve, these pass into its sub.stance and supply its intimate structure. The veins of the brain empty themselves into the sinuses which have been already described ; the principal veins are on the superior surface of the brain, whereas the large ar- teries are below. 0 3

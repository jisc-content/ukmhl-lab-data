2Gi leave them of little use to the student.) The calvarium being now forcibly torn away, the dura mater is ex- posed ; the latter, in some subjects, adheres so closely to the bone as to be torn along with it; this accident will injure the brain, and may be avoided by introdu- cing the handle of the knife or any blunt instrument between the membrane and the bone as you gradually raise off the latter. If the student can procure two subjects it will facilitate his study to examine the brain of both at the same time ; in one dissect the parts in situ, and from the other remove the brain in the follow- ing manner ; commencing anteriorly, gently raise it from the base of the skull, divide each nen'e and vessel in succession from before backwards close to the bone, dislocate the pituitary gland from the sella turcica, and cut through the tentorium ; next divide the spinal cord as low down in the neck as you can pass the knife through the foramen magnum; then place the brain, its base up- wards, in a shallow basin; thus the different surfaces and structures of the braiu, as also the several processes and sinuses of the dura mater, can be examined in continua- tion with each other. The MEMBRANES covering the brain are three, the dura mater, arachnoid membrane, and pia mater; the first may be termed the fibrous, the second the serous, and the third the vascular coat ; these three tunics also extend through the spinal canal and cover the spinal cord. The dura viater is a fibro-serous membrane, of considerable strength, and of a whitish colour, some- times it has a bluish tint; the external surface adheres intimately to the bones ; it now presents a rough sur- face, and several red spots, particularly in the course of the sutures ; these are owing to the ruptured vessels which passed from the dura mater to the bone, the former being the internal periosteum to the latter ; in the young subject the connexion between the two is so close and vascular, that it is very difficult to separate them in the recent state, and when this is effected, nu- merous bloody dots are observable on each ; tliis mem- brane is more intimately attached to the bones at the base of the cranium-than in any otlier situation, it there sends small processes through the several foramina.

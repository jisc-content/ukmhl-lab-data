19S by everting the bladder, and dissecting off the mucons membrane near the orifice of the urethra behind the uvula. At the anterior part of the inferior region there is a compact layer of white dense fibrous substance, into t\'hich the muscular fibres of the bladder are inserted, but which itself does not appear to be muscular except near the cervix ; this structiire will be found to corres- pond with a particular region, which will be noticed pre- sently in the interior of the bladder, and which is called the trigone, or the velum. Beneath the muscular is the 3d, or the cellular coat ; it invests the whole organ, is very elastic, and seldpm contains any adipose substance. Open the bladder by a pei-pendicular incision through its anterior part; and the 4th, or the mucous coat, will be observed ; this is pale, and thrown into many folds, par- ticularly if the bladder had been empty, for this mem- brane has no contractile power; through it the muscular fibres project, presenting a reticulated appearance, and very frequently the mucous membrane forms pouches, or small sacks, between these : inferiorly is seen the orifice of the urethra ; it is somewhat of a crescentic figure, a small tubercle (the uvula) projecting into it from below : posterior to this the mucous membrane presents a smooth and dense appearance throughout a small triangular space called the velum or trigc()ie; at the posterior angles of this space the orifice of each ureter may be observed, the line extending between these forms the base of this tri- angle ; this line is somewhat semilunar ; the sides of the trigone are defined by lines drawm from each ureter to the uvula ; each is from an inch to an inch and a half in length ; beneath the membrane covering each of these lines pale muscular fibres may in general be found ; these have been named by Mr. Bell, the mus- cles of the ureters, who describes each as arising from the vesical extremity of the ureter, and thence descend- ing obliquely forwards and inwards, to be inserted by a tendon common to its fellow into the uvula. The use which he assigns to them is, to restrain the termination of the ureters, and preserve the obliquity of the passage of these tubes through the coats of the bladder when it is contracted ; for, says he, without this provision the

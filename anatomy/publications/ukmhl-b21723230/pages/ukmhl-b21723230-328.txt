The temporo-facial nerve ascends obliquely fonpards across the neck of the lower jaw ; it first communicates with the auricular branch of the inferior maxillary nerp^e, and then divides into three fasciculi, the temporal, malar, and buccal ; these nenâ€™es take that course which their name implies ; they are all remarkable for the plexiform arrangement of their branches, and for their frequent communications with each other, and with the three divisions of the fifth pair which are distributed to the face. The cervico-facial nerve descends obliquely forwards through the parotid gland towards the angle of the jaw, where it is only covered by the skin and platysma; this nen'e also divides into many branches, which may be arranged in three fasciculi, the maxillary, the sub-maxillary, and the cendcal; the first, or the maxillary, cross the ramus of the jaw and the masseter muscle, and communicate in the muscles of the lower lip with the mental nerve, and with the superior division of the seventh ; the second, or sub-maxillary, course along the base of the jaw, sending filaments to the integuments and superficial muscles, these also commu- nicate at the chin with the mental nerve ; the third, or cervical branches, are very long and numerous ; they are distributed to the platysma and to the superficial muscles of the neck, and communicate with several filaments of the cervical plexus. The portio dura nerve has been in- geniously supposed by Mr. Bell to be the nerve that ex- cites the muscles of the face in particular conditions of respiration and in the expression of passion, &c., hence he has named it the respiratory nerve of the face ; others consider the portio dura as the exclusive motor nerve of the face. . The Auditory Nerve or Portio Mollis of the seventh pair ; this nerve separates from the portio dura at the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus, and then divides into two branches, an anterior and pos- terior ; the anterior passes forwairds to the cochlea, penetrates through many small openings, and is dis- tributed to the membrane covering its spinal lamina, and to that lining the canal on its axis: the posterior branch passes outwards, forms a grey swelling, from

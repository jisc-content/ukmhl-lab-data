367 the first rib, obliquely outwards to the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle; it is covered by the integu- ments, and at first by the external border of the great pectoral muscle, lower down by the gieat and lesser pectoral, and still lower down by the tendon of the great pectoral only; it passes over the first intercostal, and serratus magnus muscles, the brachial plexus, the sub-scapÂ»ilar and the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles; the axillary vein descends along its inner and anterior part, and the brachial plexus lies pos- terior and external to it; it sends off the following arte- ries, the thoracica acromialis, the superior and long- thoracic, the sub-scapular, the posterior and anterior cir- cumflex. The acromial thoracic artery arises from the front of the axillary below the subclavian muscle, above the lesser pectoral, and opposite the fissure between the great pec- toral and deltoid muscles; it divides into several branches, which pass some to the pectoral muscles, others to the acromion process, deltoid muscle, and integuments of the shoulder and arm, one long branch accompanies the cephalic vein. The superior thoracic artery arises a little below the preceding, sometimes in common with it, it passes forwards and inwards, and divides into branches which supply the cellular membrane and glands in the ax- illa, the pectoral muscles, the breast, and the integu- ments. The long thoracic artery arises below the lesser pec- toral, descends obliquely forwards along the side of the chest, parallel to the low-er edge of the great pectoral, to which it sends some branches; it terminates in the intercostal muscles and integuments, and inosculates with the internal mammary and the intercostal arte- ries. The sub-scapular artery arises opposite to and de- scends along the lower edge of the sub-scapular muscle, and soon divides into an anterior and posterior branch ; the former continues to descend along the back part of the axilla, and supplies the sub-scapular, serratus mag- nus, and latissimus dorsi muscles; the latter passes back-

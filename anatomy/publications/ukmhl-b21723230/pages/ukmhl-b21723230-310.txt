292 two fissures by transverse bands or commissures ; if either «ide be divided by a transverse section, it will be found to consist of g-rey and white substance, the latter placed externally, the former internally, and of a lunated appear- ance, the concavity looking outwards ; some grey sub- stance is also placed transversely, and connects the con- vexities of these lateral masses. The younger the sub- ject the more distinct is the cineritious substance in the spinal cord. The medullary substance on each side ap- pears to be arranged in three columns, separated by super- ficial grooves ; from these the spinal nerves proceed, and it has been partly ascertained by Majendie and Bell that the posterior roots of these nerves are endowed with sen- sation only, that the anterior are connected with vo- luntary motion, and the middle, or those which arise from the sides of the cord, with respiration. In addition to the spinal accessory nerves, w’hich may be now' seen to arise from each side of the medulla spinalis in the upper half of the neck by tw’elve or four- teen small filaments, and to ascend behind the liga- menta denticulata, the spinal cord gives origin to thirty pair of nerves. ORIGIN OF THE SPINAL NERVES. The spinal nerves are symmetrical; there are thirty pair, which are divided into eight cervical, twelve dor- sal, five lumbar, and five sacral : all these nerves arise and terminate nearly in a similar manner ; each spinal nerve is at first composed of tw’o roots, an anterior and posterior, each of w'hich consists of several filaments, which arise from the anterior and posterior surface of the spinal cord on either side of the median fissures; these filaments unite into fasciculi; those composing the posterior root are larger than those in the anterior ; these two fasciculi or roots are separated from each other by the side of the spinal cord, and by the liga- mentum dentatum ; they then converge and proceed ob- liquely outwards and downwards to the dura mater, W'hich they perforate distinctly by two small openings.

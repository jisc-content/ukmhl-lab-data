432 often entangled in the notches. The internal or cere- bral surface is concave, and marked by two lines which cross about the centre, or opposite the tuberosity, these bound four fossae, the two superior receive the posterior lobes of the cerebram, and are marked by their convo- lutions, the inferior are smooth, and lodge the hemis- pheres of the cerebellum, to the vertical ridge is at- tached the falx cerebri above and falx cerebelli below; the lower extremity of the latter is bifurcated, the upper half is grooved for the longitudinal sinus ; to the trans- verse ridge the tentorium is attached, it is grooved for the lateral sinus; the basilar process is concave from side to side, to support the pons Varolii and the basilar artery; on either margin of it is a slight groove for the inferior petrosal sinus; on each side of the foramen magnum above the jugular processes is a groove for the lower extremity of the lateral sinus. This bone is joined to six bones, viz. the two parietal, two temporal, the sphenoid and the atlas. Its processes are six, namely, two condyles, two jugidar, the basilar, and the tuberosity. Its foramina are five proper and two com- mon ; the proper are, the magnum, the two anterior and two posterior condyloid ; the common are, the fora- mina lacera postica basis cranii, these foramina are com- pleted by the petrous bone, each is imperfectly* divided into two, a small anterior portion which transmits the eighth pair of nenâ€™es, and a larger posterior which lodges the termination of the lateral sinus in the com- mencement of the internal jugular vein. This is a very hard bone, although thin throughout except at the ridges and processes; it is developed from four points, one for the basilar process, one for each condyle, and one for the upper and back part. The Temporal Bones are situated at the lateral, mid- dle, and inferior parts of the skull, of a very irregular shape, thin above and before, and thick behind and be- low ; each may be divided into three portions, the squa- mous, the mastoid, and the petrous. The J5ars squajnosa is the superior division, it is flat, thin, and scaly, forms part of the temporal fossa, is bounded above by a semicir- cular edge, and below by the zygomatic process, which is

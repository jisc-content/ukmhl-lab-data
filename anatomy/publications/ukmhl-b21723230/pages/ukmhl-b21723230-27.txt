it lies on the mucous membrane, and on the following, B 3 muscle. Le VATOR LABii Infeuioris, is exposed by turning down the lower lip, and raising the mucous membrane by the side of the fnenum ; arises from the alveoli of ihe incisor teeth of the lower ma.xilla, by the side of the symphisis; the fibres diverge as they descend ob- liquely forwards between the mucous membrane and the depressor labii inferioris; inserted into the integu- ments of the chin; use, to elevate the chin and lower lip: this muscle is analogous to the depressor of the upper Ifp. Orbicularis Oris, surrounds the opening of the mouth ; consists of two fleshy fasciculi, one for either lip, placed between the skin and mucous membrane, and constituting the chief thickness of the lip; these fasciculi decussate each other at the commissures, and intermix with all the muscles inserted there; use, to ap- proximate the lips and regulate their motions in the act of speaking, also to close the mouth, and to oppose the action of the several muscles which are inserted into the commissures. This muscle has no bony attach- ment; its fibres are blended with fat, particularly on their cutaneous surface; internally they are more smooth and distinct. Buccinator, is broad, thin, and somewhat square ; arises posteriorly from the two last alveoli of the su- jierior maxilla, as far back as the pterygoid process, from the external surface of the posterior alveoli of the lower maxilla, as far back as the coronoid process, and form a strong aponeurosis, named the intermaxillary ligament, which extends from the pterygoid plate to the root of the coronoid process, and which aflbrds at- tachment to the superior constrictor of the pharyn.x, posteriorly, and to the buccinator anteriorly. From these three origins the fibres pass horizontally for- wards, converging a little, and are inserted into the commissure of the lips, where they intermix with those of the orbicularis and the other muscles at the angle of the mouth. Use, to press the cheek against the teeth, so as to push the food between them, and dimi- nish the cavity of the mouth ; also to retract the com-

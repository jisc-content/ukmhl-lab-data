148 laminae, which descend from the lower end of the spleen, and from the anterior and posterior surface of the stomach ; between these laminae are several long and tortuous vessels, descending from the vessels of the sto- mach, and some adipose substance, the quantity of which varies very much in different subjects; the great omen- tum descends in front of the large and small intestines to the lower part of the abdomen, in general lower on the left than on the right side ; (this explains the reason why omentum is more frequently found in a herniary sac on the left than on the right side ;) it then turns upwards and backwards until it reaches the transverse arch of the colon; that portion of omentum, therefore, which is inferior to the colon, consists of four laminae, two de- scending and tw^o ascending; these, in the young subject, can be separated from each other, and a distinct cavity can be seen between them ; this is part of the cavity or bag of the omentum which communicates with the gene- ral cavity of the peritonaeum by tbe opening of Winslow, and which will be more particularly described presently; at the arch of the colon the two ascending laminae of the great omentum separate to enclose this intestine, and again uniting form the commencement of the following process. The transverse meso-colon extends from the concave border of the arch of the colon backwards to the spine ; this process is very strong and dense, it encloses the ves- sels of the colon and forms a sort of division or partition in t^e abdomen between the epigastric and umbilical re- gions ; when the transverse meso-colon has arrived at the spine, its two laminae separate, one descends, the other ascends; the descending layer is very strong, expands laterally into the right and left lumbar regions, in each of which it is reflected either partially or perfectly around the ascending and descending colon, and thus forms a short fold or process very irregular in difierent subjects, termed the right and left lumbar 7neso-colons; the inferior or descending layer of the transverse meso- colon is continued obliquely downwards in the middle line to form the mesenteiy, a process which we shall trace tvhen we have pursued the superior or ascending layer of the meso-colon to its termination.

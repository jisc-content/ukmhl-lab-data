74^ next examined. The left auricle is situated at the up- per and back part of the heart, in front of the mediasti- num ; it may be exposed, either by raising the apex of the heart, or removing this organ from the body, and placing it on its anterior surface ; it is somewhat square, smaller than the right, but its parietes are thicker and stronger: from its upper and left extremity its appendix, which is very small, passes forwards, and overlaps the origin of the pulmonary artery; lay open this cavity by a perpen- dicular incision along its middle line; internally we per- ceive it smooth, except in the appendix, where a few fleshy fasciculi appear, as in the right side ; on the sep- tum auricularum, a slight depression, not so distinct as that in the right auricle, marks the former situation of the foramen ovale; the four pulmonary veins are seen opening into the angles of this cavity, two on each side; those of the left open very near each other, and some- times in common, beneath the opening of the appendix; at its inferior part w'e perceive the opening into the left ventricle, circular, smooth, and marked by a white line, as in the right auricula-ventricular opening, than which this of the left side is somewhat smaller. The left ven- tricle is conical; its apex forms the apex of the heart; flattened anteriorly; longer but smaller than the right ventricle; its parietes are much thicker, and to it the septum cordis appears to belong : continue the incision that had been made in the left auricle downwards along the back of the left ventricle to its apex: the great thick- ness of its walls, and the roughness of its internal sur- face from the strong and projecting carneae columnse, may now be remarked ; at the superior part of this ca- vity we find the auricular and aortic openings; these lie very near each other, the arterial being immediately in front of the auricular; from the circumference of the latter there descends a fold of membrane, which divides into two portions, called the mitral valves; these are stronger, but in every other respect are similar to the tricuspid valves in the right ventricle; these also an- swer a similar office, that of preventing the blood return- ing from the left auricle. The aortic opening is situated at the upper and anterior part of the left ventricle, in front of the auricular, from which it is separated by the

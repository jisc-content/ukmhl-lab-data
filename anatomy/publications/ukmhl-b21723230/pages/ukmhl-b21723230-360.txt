84^2 which rests on the membrane of the fenestra ovalis, be- tween which and the membrana tympani these four Iwnes form a connecting chain, for the purpose of conveying the impressions of sound from the membrana tympani to the internal ear. The malleus is immediately behind the membrana tympani, it presents a head, neck, handle, a long and short process ; the head is smooth and articu- lated behind with the incus, the neck is small, and gives origin anteriorly to the processus gracilis, which is about half an inch long, traverses the glenoid fissure, and gives attachment to the tendon of the laxator tympani muscle; the handle descends from the neck, adheres to the mem- brana tympani, and has a short process superiorly for the insertion of the tensor tympani muscle. The incus is internal and posterior to the malleus, presents a body, and a long and short crus; the body is directed forwards and upwards, and receives the head of the malleus, the- su- perior crus is short, and lies in the foramen of the mas- toid cells, the inferior long, and perpendicular, is articu- lated with the following :—^The os orbiculare, extremely small, is between the incus and the following :—The stapes is placed horizontally, the base is on the fenestra ovalis, the head is articulated to the orbicular bone, the neck gives attachment to the stapedius muscle, the crura of the stirrup are separated by a space filled by mem- brane. There are three muscles in the tympanum, viz. stape-* dius, tensor, and laxator tympani. Stapedius arises within the pyramid; its tendon is inserted into the neck of the stapes ; its use is to raise the stapes, and to press its base against the fenestra ovalis. Tensor tympani arises in the canal in the petrous bone above the Eusta- chian tube, passes backwards into the tympanum, and is inserted into the short process below the neck of the mal- leus ; use, to draw the malleus into the tympanum, and thus to increase the concavity of the membrana tympani. Laxator tympani arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and from the Eustachian tube, ends in a delicate tendon which passes through the glenoid fissure along with the corda tympani, and is mserted into the processus gracilis of the malleus or the process of Raw.

246 vessels and nerve are to its outer or fibular side, a small bursa separates its tendon from the upper part of the in- ternal cuneiform bone; another bursa in general sur- rounds it, as it is passing over the synovial membrane of the ankle joint. Extensor Digitorum Longus, arises tendinous and fleshy from the external part of the head of the tibia, from the head of the fibula, and from about three-fourths of this bone, from part of the interosse- ous ligament, from the fascia of the leg, and its inter- muscular septa; the fibres descend obliquely inwards; a little below the middle of the leg they end in three flat tendons, which pass under the annular ligament through a ring common to these and to the peronaeus longus, and extend forwards over the dorsum of the foot, the internal of the three tendons here divides into two; the four tendons now extend along- the dor- sum of each of the four external toes; the great toe does not receive any, and are inserted into the last pha- lanx of each. Use, to extend the toes and flex the ankle. This muscle is superficial; superiorly, it lies between the tibialis anficus and peronaeus longus, and is connected to both; in the middle of the leg it> is be- tw'een the extensor pollicis and peronaeus brevis: along each of the toes these â€¢ tendons subdivide at-the joints between the first and second phalanges, into fasciculi, which pass over the sides of these articulations as the extensor tendons do on the fingers; on the dorsum of the toes also they form a sort of aponeurosis as on the fingers, the tendons of the lumbricales and interossei as also the tendons of the extensor brevis assisting in its formation. Extensor Pollicis Proprius, arises tendinous and fleshy from the inner edge of the middle third of the fibula, and from the interosseous ligament nearly as low down as the ankle; a few fibres also proceed from the lower part of the tibia; the fibres descend obliquely forwards to a tendon, which passes beneath the annular ligament, then runs forwards over the as- tragalus, naviculare, and cuneiformc internum; the tendon next passes over the first metatarsal bone, and is inserted by two tendinous fasciculi, one into the base of the first phalanx, and the other into the base

358 tebrae. In the posterior mediastinum the aorta de- scends on the left of the thoracic duct and vena azygos, and rather behind the oesophagus. In the abdomen it lies between the crura of the diaphragm and the psoaj muscles, on the left side of the vena cava and behind the vena porta, the pancreas and the peritonaeum. From the,arch of the aorta five arteries arise, the right and left coronary, the innominata, the left carotid, and left subclavian. The right and left Coronary Arteries arise above two of the sigmoid valves; the right proceeds along the base towards the right side of the heart, divides into se- veral long branches, which supply the parietes of the right auricle and ventricle, and communicate with the left coronary: the left descends obliquely along the left side of the heart supplying the parietes of the left auri- cle and ventricle, and communicating with the former around the base and apex of the heart. The arteria innominata arises from the upper part of the arch, ascends obliquely to the right side, in front of the trachea, and behind the sterno thyroid muscle, and the left vena innominata; opposite the sternal end of the clavicle it divides into the right subclavian and right ca- rotid arteries. Tlie right and left carotid arteries; the right arises from the arteria innominata, the left from the arch of the aorta; these vessels ascend obliquely outwards as high as the os hyoides, opposite which each divides into the internal and external; in this course they are covered inferiorly by the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, and thyroid,'and omo-hyoid' muscles ; and superiorly, only by the skin, platysma, and fascia; the left is also cover- ed inferiorly by the sternum and the vena innominata, and at its origin differs from the right in lying on the trachea, thoracic duct and, oe.sophagus, but after this both ascend in front of the longus colli and rectus capitis muscles, the inferior thyroid artery, and the recurrent and sympathetic nerves, and are enclosed in a sheath of cellular membrane, along with and to the tra- cheal side of the vagus nerve and the internal jugular vein.

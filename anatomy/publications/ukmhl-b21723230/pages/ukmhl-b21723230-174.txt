156 fossa loosely by a process, named the meso-caecum ; the coecum is covered anteriorly by the abdominal muscles, and sometimes by the convolutions of the ileum ; it lies beneath the rig-ht kidney, and is continuous with the ileum and the colon ; the caecum is somewhat trian- gular, the apex below% the base above at the colon: on its external surface are three irregular protuber- ances, one anteriorly, and two posteriorly ; from the lower and posterior part of the caecum a small process, named appendix vermiformis, about the size of a goose quill, hangs into the pelvis ; it is attached to and com- municates w'ith the caecum just below the ileum : a sort of mesentery connects it in its situation : its use is not ascertained. The ileum joins the left or inner side of the caecum at a very acute angle; it appears to perfo- rate the caecum, the peritonaeum and external muscu- lar fibres of the ileum being continued into the corres- ponding parietes of the caecum, w'hile the circular fibres and mucous coat of the ileum protrude into the caecum, as may be seen by opening the latter in a perpendicular direction, on the opposite,- that is, on the right side, and washing out its contents ; we then perceive the open- ing of the ileum, narrow, like a transverse slit, looking obliquely downwards and outw'ards, towards the right ileum, and protected by two semilunar folds of mucous membrane, which enclose a few muscular fibres. The inferior fold, or ilio^'CCEcal valve, is the larger, is placed somewhat vertical, and secures the ileum against any matter re-entering it from the caecum, the superior fold, or ilio-colic valve is smaller, and placed rather ho- rizontal ; it secures the ileum against regurgitation from the colon ; these semilunar folds are united to each other at their extremities, (commissures) and from each commissure a prominent fold is continued round on the inner side of tJie caecum : these folds are called the frae- na or retinacula of these valves, in consequence of which, and of the commissures, the distension of the cfecum doses the ilio-caecal foramen ; the cmcum is provided with the same longitudinal bands as the colon; it has no valvulae conniventes. The colon extends from the cmcum to the rectum; it is divided into four portions, the right or ascending, the middle or transverse arch.

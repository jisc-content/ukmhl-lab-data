97 long head, which arises by a long tendon, from the up- per part of the glenoid ligament of the scapula : this ten- don passes outwards to the joint and over the head of the humerus ; it then descends into the groove, between the two tuberosities of this bone, in which groove it is bound down: by tendinous fibres, continued from the capsular ligament, and from the adjacent tendons; the synovial membrane of the joint is reflected on this ten- don at its origin, and is again reflected from it inferiorly on the parietes of the groove, between the tendons of the great pectoral, latissimus dorsi and teres major mus- cles ; thus, although the tendon passes through the cavity of the joint, it is strictly speaking, external to the syno- vial membrane. A little below the middle of the hu- merus, these two portions of the biceps unite in a large fleshy belly, which descending to within about an inch and a half of the elbow joint, ends in a flat tendon ; this sends off a process called the semilunar fascia, to join the general aponeurosis of the forearm, and then sinks below the joint into a triangular hollow between the su- pinator longus and pronator teres, and is inserted into the back part of the tubercle of the radius: a bursa intervenes between this tendon and the anterior part of the tubercle, which is covered by cartilage, â€™the semilu- nar fascia, which arises narrow from the fore part of this tendon, opposite the bend of the elbow, passes upward and inwards, expanding towards the internal condyle, to which, and to the muscles proceeding from it, some of its fibres are attached; the remaining become continuous with the aponeurosis of the forearm. Use, to flex the forearm, and make tense its fascia ; also to abduct and raise the arm. When the hand is prone, the first effect of the contraction of the biceps is to roll the radius out- wards, and turn the hand supine ; the long tendon of the biceps, by passing over the head of the humerus, prevents this bone being dislocated upwards and outwards, as otherwise might occur, in consequence of a fall, or of a sudden muscular contraction ; the biceps may also a ssist the coraco-brachialis, in rotating the scapula on the hu- merus, 80 as to depress the point of the shoulder. The long head of the biceps is concealed by the deltoid, su- pra-spinatus and capsular ligament; the short head, by r *

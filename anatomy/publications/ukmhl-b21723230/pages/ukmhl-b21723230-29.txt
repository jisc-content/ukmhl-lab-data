11 terlor part of the glenoid cavity in the temporal bone, and adheres to the capsular ligament of the maxilla, and inferiorly it is wedged in between the internal pterygoid, digastric, and styloid muscles. The external carotid artery and several of its branches, with their accompanying veins and branches of the inferior max- illary and cervical nerves, pass through this gland ; the plexus of the portio dura, or facial nerve, also tra- verses it from behind forwards, and gives off numerous branches in its substance: this plexus is superficial to the artery, and in some cases between it and the veins. Several absorbent glands are connected to it, particu- larly to its inferior part; frequently one or two, very sra^l, may be found imbedded in its substance in front of the meatus auditorius. From the anterior and supe- rior part of the gland there passes forwards a small white tube, called Stemâ€™s duct, or the parotid duct; this duct arises from the xmion of numerous small tubes, which issue, each, from one of the granulations of the gland; it passes forwards over the masseter muscle about an inch below the zygoma, parallel to a line drawn from the tube of the ear towards the tip of the nose; it winds round the anterior edge of the masseter, beneath the zygomatic muscles and through a quantity of soft adeps, pierces the buccinator, and opens through the mucous membrane of the mouth by a very small hole opposite the 2d or 3d superior molar tooth, about half an inch from the junction of the cheek with the gum. Between the duct and the zygoma, a small glan- dular mass is frequently found; it appears like p de- tached lobe of the parotid, it is named the socia paroti- dis; from the lower and anterior part of this process a small duct proceeds, which after a short course unites with the duct of Steno; in some this duct opens dis- tinctly into the mouth. The transverse artery of the face, and several branches of the facial nerve, accom- pany this vessel, and in general the artery is superior to it, while the nerves wind around it. The parotid gland is composed of numerous small granulations, united together by cellular tissue, and by branches of blood-vessels and nerves, and by the small roots of its excretory duct. This duct appears much

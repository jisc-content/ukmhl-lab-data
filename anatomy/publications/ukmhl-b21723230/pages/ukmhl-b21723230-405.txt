387 s 2 glands; the lymphatics from the inferior extremities and from the pelvis ascend towards the spine, form a plexus round the iliac arteries, and pass behind the aorta close to the vertebrae, and terminate in the receptaculum chyli, or the commencement of the thoracic duct, into which nu- merous lymphatic or lacteal vessels open from the intes- tinal canal. The lacteal or chiliferous vessels commence from open mouths on the surface of the intestine, and thence pass through the mesenteric glands, increasing- in size and diminishing in number, towards the spine. The lymphatics of the stomach take the course of the arteries of that viscus, also towards the spine, and join tire thoracic duct. The lymphatics of the liver are superficial and deep, the former are very distinct, some pass back towards the spine, others ascend along the fal- ciform ligament, enter the thorax, and proceed through the anterior mediastinum to the thoracic duct near its termination ; the deep lymphatics pass, some out of the transverse fissure, others from the posterior edge of the liver on the diaphragm, all then pass back tOAvards the spine. The thoracic canal commences on the body of the second or third lumbar vertebra by a large dilatation, named the receptaculum chyli; it then ascends between the crura of the diaphragm into the posterior mediasti- num, and is situated on the right of the aorta, on the left of the vena azygos, and behind the oesophagus ; with these relations, it rises to about the fifth dorsal vertebra, and then crosses the spine obliquely to the left side, passing behind the oesophagus and the arch of the aorta ; it then again ascends, and is placed beneath the left pleura, between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and along the left side of the oesophagus, it rises into the neck, as high as the sixth vertebra, behind the carotid and thyroid arteries, and jugular vein; it then curves outwards and downwards, and opens into the left subclaAdan vein, close to the jugular. Two valves internally protect this opening, these are situated one at either side. The thoracic duct receives in its course along the thorax several branches from the lungs, the heart, and the parietes of the chest ; in

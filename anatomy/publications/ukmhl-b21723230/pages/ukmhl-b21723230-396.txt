378 at first internal, afterwards posterior to it; the anterior crural nerve is external to it, two or three of its branches are very near it, above the middle of the thigh, one small nerve crosses the artery, and the saphenus nerve descends in its sheath along the fore-part of the vessel ; it sends off, 1st, three or four superficial branches, viz.;—ingui- nal branches io the inguinal glands, &c.; the superficial pudic, one or two in number, which pass towards the pubis and are lost in the integuments ; the superficial epigastric, the longest and largest of these branches, as- cends obliquely inwards towards the umbilicus, parallel to the internal epigastric, and is lost in the integuments; the external circumfiex ilii extends along Poupart’s liga- ment to the crest of the ilium, where it terminates in the skin ; 2nd, the profunda is the largest branch of the fe- moral, it arises about tw'o inches below the crural arch, from the outer and back part of the femoral artery, bends a little outwards at first, then descends obliquely inwards and backw-ards behind the femoral artery, and the tendon of the adductor longus, passing over the psoas, crurseus, and adductor brevis; at the back part of the thigh it ter- minates in two branches for the hamstring muscles ; in this course it gives off the two circumflex, and the three ’ perforating branches ; the external circumfiex artery arises from the outer part of the profunda, passes trans- versely beneath the sartorius and rectus muscles, and divides into three fasciculi of branches, superior, middle, and inferior; the first ascend along the tensor vagin® and glutmus medius muscles, and inosculate with the glutmal artery; the second pass round the bone to its back part and inosculate wuth the glutmal, sciatic, and internal circumflex arteries ; the third are the longest and largest branches, they descend towards the knee and supply the extensor muscles. The internal circumflex artery arises sometimes below, sometimes above the preceding, it often proceeds from the femoral itself, it passes backwards between the psoas and pectin®us, along the obturator externus tendon, to the back part of the thigh, first sending off several branches to the surrounding muscles, and to the hip joint, also some to inosculate with the obturator artery ; at the back of the

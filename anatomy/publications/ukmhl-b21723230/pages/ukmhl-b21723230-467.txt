449 joined to the maxillary, inferior spongy, vomer, sphe- noid, and fethmoid, and to the opposite palate bone ; it is composed of thin compact substance, and is well formed in the foetus ; its processes are seven, palate, nasal, pterjâ€™goid, orbital, sphenoidal posterior nasal spirae and crest ; its foramina are one proper and two common. The proper is the posterior palatine hole or holes; the common are the posterior palatine or pterygo-maxillary canal and the spheno-palatine hole ; the latter is above the nasal plate, below the body of the sphenoid and be- tween the orbital processes of the palate bone, it trans- mits the nasal nerve and artery from the spheno-maxillary fossa into the nose. The Inferior Spongy or Turbinated Bone, placed on the lower part of the outer side of the nose, elongated from before backwards, it presents a wrinkled or a rug- ged surface, convex towards the nose, concave outwards, its lower edge is loose, spongy, and curled outwards ; the upper edge is uneven, thin, and joined to the unguis, and to the maxillary and palate bones ; it is connected to the unguis by a thin pyramidal process which completes the nasal duct; it is also in general united to the descend- ing oblique process of the aethmoid, it is composed of very thin brittle substance marked with pores and little spines. The Os Unguis or Lachry?nal Bone is placed at the inner and forepart of the orbit; below the os frontis, be- hind the nasal process of the superior maxillary and be- fore the aethmoid bone, it is of an oblong square shape, and very thin, it covers the anterior ethmoidal cells ; ex- ternally it is divided by a perpendicular ridge, which ter- minates below in a little hook-like process, into two unequal plates, the posterior or orbital plate is short and broad, the anterior lachrymal plate is concave, long and narrow, and forms part of the lachrymal or nasal fossa and duct. The os unguis is joined above to the internal an- gular and orbitar processes of the os frontis ; behind to the os planum of the sethmoid, below to the orbitar plate of the maxillary, before to the nasal process of the same, and before and below to the inferior spongy bone ; its structure is very thin but compact.

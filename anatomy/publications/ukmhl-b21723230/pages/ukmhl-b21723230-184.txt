1G6 somewhat purple or livid ; it is covered by peritonseum, and beneath this by a fibrous capsulae, which invests its entire surface, and also passes into its substance along with the blood vessels, and assists in forming the cells of which this organ is composed; these cells are found to contain a quantity of blood, partly coagulated; also a number of small grains, which may be separated by maceration, but the nature of which is not well under- stood ; the spleen has no excretory duct. The exact use or function of this viscus is not yet ascertained; some- times two or more small bodies, of the same colour and structure as the spleen, are found in its vicinity, between the laminae of the omentum. The Pancreas lies behind the stomach, and may be exposed by dividing the great omentum below the sto- mach, and raising the latter organ towards the thorax. This conglomerate gland is of gveat length, about seven inches long, and about an inch and a half broad ; it ex- tends from the lower part of the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions, obliquely downwards and forwards into the umbilical region, where it is surrounded by the duodenum ; it is covered by the stomach and the ascend- ing layer of the meso-colon; it lies anterior to the left crus of the diaphragm, the vena porta, and the aorta, and overlaps the concave border of the duodenum, to which it adheres very closely. The splenic or left extremity (its tail) is small, compared with the right, which is broad and flat, and is named the head; the anteripr surface looks a little upwards, the inferior edge being raised fbr- w'ards by the superior mesenteric artery and vein, which pass behind it; a groove may be remarked on the pos- terior and upper part of the pancreas ; this contains the splenic artery and vein. The pancreatic duct may be seen by scraping off a little of the posterior surface of the gland about its centre. Tliis duct is remarkably white and thin; it commences in the small extremity of the gland, and extends to the large end, receiving in its course numerous branches on each side : it usually joins the ductus choledochus; it sometimes, however, opens into the duodenum distinctly; attached to the head of the pancreas there is sometimes a glandular mass of the same structure as the pancreas, and opening by a small

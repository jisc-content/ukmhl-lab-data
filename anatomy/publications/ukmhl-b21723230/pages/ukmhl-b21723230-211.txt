193 nales, it then ascends on the back part and sides of this organ to its superior fundus, whence it is continued to the abdominal muscles; below the line of its reflection on the bladder, or below the cul de sac, we may again take notice of the triangular space on the inferior fundus of the bladder, before alluded to as the situation in which that viscus can be punctured from the rectum, in case of retention of urine. The reflections of the peritonaeum from each side of the rectum to the back part of the bladder, are called the posterior ligaments, and the fold which this membrane forms on each side between the bladder and the iliac fossa are named the lateral ligaments of the bladder ; these shall be more particularly noticed presently. Remark, the cuiwed course of the rectum, its dilatation near the anus, also the connexion of the peritonaeum to its upper and middle thirds, and observe that the lower third of this intestine is completely below and unattached to this membrane. Next study the con- nexions of the urinary bladder. Vesica Urinaria, when contracted, is situated in the anterior and inferior part of the pelvis behind and be- low the pubis ; when distended it occupies more or less of the hypogastric region; when contracted, it appears of a flattened triangular form, the base towards the rec- tum, the apex behind the lower edge of the symphysis pubis ; when distended, it presents an oval figure, the larger end towards the rectum, the smaller and anterior end towards the recti abdominis muscles, between the pubis and the peritonaeum: the axis of the bladder is a line directed through its cavity from one extremity to the other; the posterior end of this line, if produced, would touch the extremity of the coccyx, and if conti- nued anteriorly it would reach the linea alba, midway between the pubes and the umbilicus. In the very young subject, the bladder is of a pyriform figure, and is principally lodged in the hypogastric region. The bladder is connected to the parietes and to the viscera of the pelvis by folds of the peritonaeum, and by the re- flections of the pelvic fascia. The folds of the perito- I naeum are termed false ligaments, and are five in num- I ber, viz. two posterior, two lateral, and one superior: j the true ligaments are reflections of the pelvic fascia, K

1G7 vessel in the pancreatic duct; this is named the lesser pancreas. The pancreatic fluid is supposed to he of use in diluting the bile, and rendering it and the con- tents of the duodenum more miscible with each other. The structure of the pancreas is similar to that of the salivary glands, and is thence called by some, the abdo- minal salivary gland. OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE ABDOMEN. The abdominal aorta gives off three large branches to supply the organs of digestion, viz. the coeliac axis, the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries. The coeliac axis may be seen by tearing through the les- ser omentum above the lesser cun'ature of the stomach, to arise from the forepart of the aorta, at the upper edge of the pancreas; it is about half an inch long, and divides into three branches, viz, the gastric, hepatic and splenic; the gastric artery and its branches run between the la- minae of the lesser omentum, along the concave edge of the stomach, and supply both surfaces of this organ. The hepatic artery accompanies the vena porta and the bUiary duct to the transverse fissure of ihe liver, first sending off a small branch to the pylorus (pylo- rica superior,) next a large branch (gastro-duode- nalis,) which descends behind the pylorus and subdi- vides into, two branches, the pancreatico-duodenalis and gastro-epiploica dextra; the former supplies the pancreas and duodenum ; the latter runs along the con- vex edge of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum ; the hepatic artery then divides into the right and left hepatic arteries, which supply the right and left lobes of the liver; the right hepatic is the larger, and gives off a small branch, arteria cystica, to the gall bladder. The splenic artery is the longest and largest branch of the coeliac axis; it passes along the upper and posterior part of the pancreas, to which it gives many branches; near the spleen it sends oft the gastro-epiploica sinistra, which runs along the convex edge of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum; the splenic artery then divides into five or

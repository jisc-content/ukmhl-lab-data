152 it is situated between the left or great end and the lesser curvature, about three inches distant from the former; it is surrounded by vessels and nerves. The ptjloric orifice is between the stomach and the duodenum ; it lies to the right side of the spine ; it is, in general, in contact with the liver and gall bladder, and anterior to the pancreas ; it lies inferior, anterior, and to the right side of the cardiac orifice; it has a peculiar firm, hard feel. The anterior surface looks upwards and fonvards, and is in contact with the diaphragm, the ribs, and the left lobe of the liver. The posterior surface looks backwards and downwards, and rests on the meso-colon. The lesser, or concave edge of the stomach, looks backwards and upwards towards the spine and lobulus spigelii of the liver; this edge, near the pylorus, is convex, the great edge being concave opposite to this; the lesser omentum is attached to it, and the co- ronary vessels run along it. The great or convex edge looks forwards and downwards towards the colon; to it the great omentum and the epiploic vessels are attached : in the empty or contracted state of the stomach, these edges are thin and directed almost vertically, but when the stomach is distended, they become enlarged and round, and continuous with the surfaces. The stomach is com- posed of three tunics, a serous, a muscular, and a mu- cous ; these are connected to each other by two laminae of cellular membrane ; the serous or peritonceal coat is de- rived, as was before explained, from the laminae of the lesser omentum, separating at the lesser curvature, ex- panding over its surfaces, and uniting along the convex edge, to form the great omentum: the serous coat is loosely united to the edges, but almost inseparably so to the middle of each surface and to the pyloric extremity; a layer of very fine cellular tissue connects this to the following tunic, the muscular ; this consists of fibres, which run in three different directions ; the 1st or super- ficial are longitudinal; they are continued from the oeso- phagus, and are very strong along the curvatures, parti- cularly on the lesser; the middle layer of fibres run cir- cularly ; they commence at the left extremity, or cid de sac, and are arranged in nearly parallel rings ; they are very strong about the centre, where they often cause a con-

311 which proceed several filaments to supply the membrane lining the vestibule and semi-circular canals.â€”(See Ana- tomy of the Ear.) Glosso-ph.\ryngeal Nerve, or the first branch of the eighth pair ; this small nerve passes through the foramen lacerum posterius by a distinct canal, it then passes downwards and forwards anterior and internal to the jugular vein and carotid artery, and behind the stylo- pharjTigcus muscle ; it then wunds round this muscle to its fore-part and descends obliquely inwards between it and the stylo-glossus to the posterior and lateral parts of the tongue ; in this course this nerve forms an arch near- ly parallel to that which the gustatory and lingual nerves describe; the glosso-pharyngeal is smaller than either of these nerves ; it is situated betw'een them, but deeper than either, and has very little, if any, communication with them. As this nerve leaves the cranium it sends one or two small twigs into the temporal bone, these communicate with the carotid plexus in the cavernous sinus ; it is next attached to the facial, pneumo-gastric, and sympathetic nerves by small filaments, which are connected together by loose reddish cellular membrane, and entangled with several small vessels. This nerve next gives oflF some branches to the pharyngeal plexus, some of these descend along the neck, and unite with the sympathetic and cardiac nerves, others ascend to the amygdala, and assist in forming the tonsillitic plex- us ; as it approaches the pharynx, this nerve gives se- veral branches to the stylo-pharyngeus and hyo-glossus muscles, also to the superior and middle constrictors of the pharynx ; several filaments pass between these to the mucous membrane of the pharynx and fauces, also to the folds or arches of the palate and to the epiglottis ; the remaining branches of the glosso-pha- ryngeal nerve are distributed to the muscular sub- stance, papillae, and mucous membrane at the root of the tongue. Pneumo-gastric Nerve, or nervus vagus ; this large nerve passes through the foramen lacerum in a fibrous canal distinct from the last described nerve, and anterior to the jugular vein ; it then communicates with

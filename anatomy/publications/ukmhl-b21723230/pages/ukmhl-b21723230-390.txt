S72 The Abdominal Aorta sends o£F the following branches; the phrenic, coeliac axis, superior mesente- ric, inferior mesenteric, renal, supra-renal, spermatic, lumbar, and middle sacral. The phrenic arteries arise in common, or near each other, from the fore-part of the aorta; they both send branches to the supra-renal capsules and to the crura of the diaphragm; the right ascends behind the vena cava; the left behind the oesophagus ; on the diaphragm each divides into an external and internal branch ; the former passes towards the circumference of the muscle, and inosculates with the internal mammary and the in- ferior intercostals ; the latter encircles the central ten- don, communicates with its fellow and with the phrenic branches of the mammary. The coeliac axis arises from the fore-part of the aorta opposite the last dorsal vertebra; it soon divides into three branches, 1st, the gastric artery ascends ob- liquely to the left side, to the cardiac orifice, to which and to the cesophagus it sends several branches ; it then bends along the lesser curvature tow'ards the right side betw^een the laminae of the lesser omentum and inos- culates with the superior pyloric artery; it sends its branches to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach; 2nd, hepatic artery ascends obliquely to- wards the right side, in front and to the left side of the vena porta and ductus choledochus, and in the transverse fissure of the liver, divides into right and left hepatic arteries; in this course it gives off the superior pyloric, which passes along the upper surface of the pylorus and joins the gastric artery; and the gastro-duodenalis w'hich descends between the pylo- ]’us and the duodenum; this gives off inferior pyloric branches, and divides into the pancreatico-duodena- tis and gastro-epiploica dextra: the former takes a carved course between the duodenum and the pancreas, sending branches to each, and inosculates with the superior mesenteric artery; the latter turns forwards, and (o the left side along the great curvature of the stomach, between it and the laminae of the great omen- tum, to which, as well as the gtomach, it sends nu-

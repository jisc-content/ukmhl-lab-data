500 simple dislocations. A primary dislocation, either di- rectly backwards or directly forwards, is not likely to happen, as the strong attachments of the teres minor, supra and infra-spinati muscles to the greater tubercle of the humerus, and that of the sub-scapular to the lesser tubercle, respectively offer powerful resistance in either of these directions. It is plain then from the con- struction of this joint, that a dislocation downwards, where the head of the bone rests on the sternal costa of the scapula, between the subscapularis and long bead of the triceps, is the most likely to occur; for the lower part of the capsular ligament being unsupported by muscles, is most weak ; and the action of the levator muscles of the shoulder, by rotating the head of the hu- merus from above down, will bring the head of the bone near the infei-ior edge of the glenoid cavity, and thus place it in a situation most favourable for displacement, when violence is applied to the extended arm. There is but one circumstance in the construction of the joint which has a tendency to counteract the accident, which is, that the glenoid cavity is of greater extent from above <lown than across. DISLOC.\TION DOWNWARDS. When the humerus is dislocated dowmwards, the head of the bone is found resting on the sternal costa of the scapula, between the long head of the triceps and sub-scapularis. The lower portion of the cap.su- lar ligament is ruptured, and sometimes the tendon of the sub-scapularis ; the tendons of the supra and infra- spinati muscles and of the teres minor are also sometimes lacerated. The anatomy of the sound joint w'ould lead us to conclude that these latter muscles should be in- jured much more frequently than -the former, but dis- sections of dislocated shoulder-joints have proved the contrary. Some of the fibres of the deltoid, pectoralis major, and coraco-brachialis are occasionally torn ; the long tendon of the biceps usually remains unbroken. Independent of external violence, the elevating muscles of the humerus, and of the wdiole arm, (if the elbow joint be fixed,) w'ith the pectoralis major, latissimus

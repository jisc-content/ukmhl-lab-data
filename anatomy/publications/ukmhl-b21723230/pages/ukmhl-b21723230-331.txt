313 f.ro brandies, external and internal; the external is distributed to the stemo and hyo-thyroid, and to the other superficial muscles, also to the thyroid gland and to the cartilages of the larynx; the internal perforates the thyro-hyoid membrane and divides into numerous branches, many of these go to the anterior surface of the epiglottis, to the glands and mucous membrane connected with it, also to the arytenoid glands and muscles ; one long filament descends obliquely forwards along the side of the larynx beneath the thyroid carti- lage and supplies the crico-thyroid muscle. As the vagus descends it frequently gives off fine filaments to the carotid artery, and to unite with the sympathetic and with the cervical nerves; a little above the arteria innominata the right vagus gives off its cardiac branches, these join the cardiac nerves from the sym- pathetic ; the nerve of the left side does not send off so many or such large branches as that on the right side; on the left side they accompany the carotid ar- tery' to the arch of the aorta, expand over it, and then join the cardiac plexus. Inferior laryngeal nerve, or recurrent; that on the right side cuiwes round the sub- clavian artery, ascends obliquely inwards behind the carotid along the side of the trachea to the larynx ; at its origin it gives off some cardiac filaments, afterwards some branches to the fore-part of the trachea and the thyroid gland ; it then supplies the lower part of the pharynx and ends in the posterior and lateral crico- aryâ€™tenoid and in the thyro-arytenoid muscles, also in the mucous membrane of the larynx, on which it com- municates with the superior laryngeal nerve. The re- current nerve on the left side is much longer, it cun'es round the arch of the aorta behind the ligamentous re- mains of the ductus arteriosus; it gives off several car- diac and pulmonary branches, and then ascends along the oesophagus and terminates in a similar manner to that on the right side. The pneumo-gastric nerves in their course through the thorax send off the pulmonary and oesopha- geal nerves. The pulmonary branches arise from each vagus a little above the roots of each lung; a few of these branches pass to the fore-part of the bronchial tubes p

SECTION II. ANATOMY OF THE VEINS. In addition to the veins which accompany the arteries, the relative situation of which has been already consi- dered, there are also several veins which run independent of these, and take a superficial or subcutaneous course. It is impossible to fix the exact point at which a vein commences ; it is generally considered that the arteries having terminated in minute ramifications or capilla- ries, the veins commence from these, so that in rea- lity each vein is a returning artery only altered in struc-

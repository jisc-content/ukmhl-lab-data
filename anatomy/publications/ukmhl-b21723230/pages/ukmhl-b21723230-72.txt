54. a bursa may be found between these two insertions of tlie pectoral muscle. From the lower edge of the cos- tal portion a fleshy slip sometimes descends and joins either the rectus or external oblique muscle of the abdo- men ; and in some a strong muscular band connects it to the inferior margin of the latissimus dorsi. Make a per- pendicular division of this muscle, reflect the edges, one tow'ards the sternum, the other towards the shoulder, and the lesser pectoral and subclavian muscles come into view. Pectoralis Minor, flat and triangular, arises from the external surface and upper edge of the 3d, 4th and .5th ribs, sometimes from the 2d, external to their car- tilages ; the fibres ascend obliquely outwards and back- wards, and converging, end in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the inner and upper surface of the coracoid process, near its anterior extremity, being here con- nected with the coraco-brachialis, and short-head of the biceps; a band of this tendon frequently passes over this process through the triangular ligament, and is connected to it, or to the tendon of the supra-spina- tus, or to the capsular ligament of the shoulder, f/se, to draw the shoulder forwards, downw'ards and inwards, also to assist the great pectoral, in elevating the ribs in inspiration. This muscle is covered by the great pec- tor^, a few of its inferior fibres are covered only by the skin; it lies anterior to the serratus magnus, axillary v'essels and nerves. SuBCLAVius, small and round, arises by a flat ten- don, from the cartilage of the 1st rib, external to the rhomboid ligament, soon becomes fleshy, and ascend- ing outwards and backwards, is inserted into the exter- nal half of the inferior surface of the clavicle, extending as far outwards as the space between the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. Use, to draw the clavicle and shoidder forwards and dowmwards, also to elevate the 1st rib in inspiration, if the shoulder and clancle be raised and fixed. This muscle is covered by the cla- vicle and great pectoral; it lies anterior to the axillary vessels and nerves, w'hich separate it from the first rib ; it is covered by a thin but strong aponeurosis, which is attached to the cartilage of the rib, and to the clavicle

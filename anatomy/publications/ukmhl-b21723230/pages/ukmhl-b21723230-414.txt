396 the hollows in the edge of the sternum ; these hollows are covered by cartilage and by synovial membranes ; each joint is strengthened by ligamentous bands, which pro- ceed from the cartilage before and behind the articulation, and are expanded upon the sternum. There is no distinct joint between the first rib and the sternum, the cartilage and bone appear to be continuous. ARTICULATIONS OP THE PELVIS. The last lumbar vertebra is joined to the sacrum in the same manner as the other vertebrae are to each other. The last lumbar vertebra is connected to the ilium by the ilio-lumbar ligament; this is sometimes divided into two, it arises from the transverse processes of the fifth and fourth lumbar vertebrae, and from the back part of the sacrum, proceeds horizontally outwards, and is in- serted into the posterior superior spinous' process and crest of the ilium. The ilium and sacrum are firmly united by a cartilage which consists of two layers, one adhering to each bone ; behind this they are connected by short ligamentous fibres, also by the sacro-sciatic li- gaments, w'hich are two in number on each side. 1st, the posterior or great sacro-sciatic ligament, arises from the lower and back part of the posterior inferior spine of the ilium, and from the back part of the sacrum and coccyx ; descends obliquely outwards, becomes nar- row and thick, and is inserted into the low'er edge of the tuber ischii; 2d, the anterior or lesser sacro-sciatic liga- ment, triangular, arises from the side of the sacrum and coccyx, passes outwards, and is inserted into the spine of the ischium. The coccyx is united to the sacram by a substance resembling the inter-vertebral, also by li- gamentous bands before and behind. The ossa pubis are closely attached by several laminae of fibro-carti- lage ; posteriorly a little fluid separates these bones which are each covered by cartilage ; this connexion is strengthened inferiorly by the pubic ligament, which is very dense, and passes from the ramus of one bone to the opposite. The obturator ligament is a thin fascia adhering to the margin of the obturator hole, except

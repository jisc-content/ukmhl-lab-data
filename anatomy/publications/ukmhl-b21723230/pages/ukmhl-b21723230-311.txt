293 which, however, are so close as to appear but one ; each fasciculus receives a sheath from the dura mater, they then pass through the inter-vertebral foramen, and in this situation a small oval ganglion is formed upon the pos- terior root of each ; to the surface of this ganglion the an- terior root is only connected ; immediately on the outer side of this ganglion the two roots unite and form a sin- gle cord ; this is the proper spinal nerve ; after a short course outwards, this divides into two branches, a poste- rior and an anterior ; the former is almost universally the smaller, and is distributed to the muscles and integu- ments posterior to the vertebral column ; the anterior branches of the spinal nerves are much larger; they enter into several plexuses, and supply the muscles anterior to the spinal column, as also the extremities. The superior cervical nerves take nearly a transverse course from their origin to the inter-vertehral foramina ; the succeed- ing nerves are more oblique, and the lumbar and sacral take a longitudinal course, and form their ganglions and subsequent divisions w’ithin the spinal canal. The course and distribution of the spinal nerves shall be examined individually afterw’ards ; the student may next dissect the brain from below. DISSECTION OF THE BR-VIN FROM BELOW. The brain, medulla oblongata, and the upper part of the spinal cord, should be carefully removed from the subject; the brain, with the base uppermost, should then be placed in a shallow basin ; the cerebellum and medulla oblongata will now fall a little backwards, and all the parts of the base of the brain will be exposed. Raise the pia mater from the fore-part and sides of the medulla oblongata ; the several eminences on this organ may be traced upwards to the cerebrum, or to the ce- rebellum ; to follow these, the dissector should rather scrape the surrounding substance with the handle or with the hack of the knife, than cut it with the edge. In the description of the biain already given, certain differences between the cineritious and the white sub-

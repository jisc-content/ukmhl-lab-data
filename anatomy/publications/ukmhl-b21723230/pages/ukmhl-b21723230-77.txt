59 median nerve, with the external cutaneous to its outer or humeral side, and with the ulnar and internal cuta- neous to its inner or thoracic side, while posterior to it are the musculo-spiral and articular nerves. The lym- phatic glands are connected to the axillary vessels by the small branches which supply them : several lie pos- terior to the edge of the pectoral muscle : from these a chain continues up to the coracoid process, and are con- tinued beneath the clavicle and the glands in the neck ; several also lie on the subscapular muscle, and some are scattered indifferently through this space. SECTION III. DISSECTION OF THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX. The thorax is situated at the upper and anterior part of the trunk; it contains the lungs, the organs of res- piration, the heart, the chief agent in the circulation of the blood, also several nerves and vessels passing to and from the heart, and through the cavity; this region is bounded anteriorly by the sternum and costal carti- lages, laterally by the ribs and intercostal muscles, pos- teriorly by the vertebrae and angles of the ribs, inieri- orly by the diaphragm, superiorly by the several mus- cles connected to the clavicle, first rib and sternum, and by the different parts passing into or out of the cavity, 'fhe thorax, viewed externally, presents a very different form before and after the upper extremities are de- tached from it; in the former state it appears of great transverse width above, and narrow below; whereas in the latter condition, it is seen to be very contracted above and expanded below. The thorax may be com- pared to a section of a cone, the posterior fourth being removed, the three anterior parts retained and united to each other. The axis of the cavity is oblique from above downwards and forwards: the base of the thorax is also oblique from before, backw'ards and downwards, and the apex, on the contrary, is oblique from behind,

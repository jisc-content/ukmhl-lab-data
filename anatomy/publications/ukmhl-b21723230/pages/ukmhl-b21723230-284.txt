m the tentorium ; the convex edge of this process corres- ponds to the middle ridge or groove of the os fronds, to the sagittal edge of the two parietal bones, and to the perpendicular ridge of the occipital; the great longitudi- nal sinus is enclosed between the layers of this process, the whole extent of this edge ; the concave or inferior border of the falx corresponds to the middle line of the corpus callosum, from â– which it is but a very short dis- tance ; the inferior or lesser longitudinal sinus is enclosed in this ridge ; the falx divides the cavity of the cranium in the median line, it separates the hemispheres of the cerebrum, and in different positions of the body supports the weight of each ; in old subjects it is often cribriform, and in some it is partly converted into bone. The tento- rium cerebelli extends in somewhat a horizontal direc- tion across the posterior part of the cranium ; it may be seen by gently raising the back part of either hemisphere of the brain ; the convex edge of this fold is attached to the transverse ridge of the occipital bone, to the inferior angle of the parietal bones, to the superior angle of the petrous bones, and to the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid ; over this last attachment, the concave edge of the tentorium glides and is inserted into the anterior clinoid processes ; the tentorium is raised and held in a state of tension along the median line by the falx, its in- ferior surface is concave ; anteriorly it presents a large oval opening, which is on a plane anterior to the foramen magnum, this is filled by the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, the crura cerebri and the pons varolii; along the convex edge of the tentorium, between its layers are tw'o sinuses on each side, the great lateral and the superior petrous, in the median Ime also is another called the straight sinus, which extends along the base of the falx; the tentorium serves to support the weight of the cere- brum off the cerebellum. TheyJiZa; cerebelli is seen when the brain is removed; it is a small but thick process of little importance, the base is superiorly attached to the tentorium, the apex inferiorly, at the foramen mag'num ; its convex edge adheres to the occipital spine, and contains between its layers the occipital sinuses ; its concave edge sepa-

146 patic vessels, is called the lesser or the gastro-hepatic omentum; it is also sometimes named the capsule of Glisson : at the lesser arch of the stomach the two la- minae of this process separate to enclose the stomach, the posterior layer giving a serous covering to the back part of this organ, and in like manner the anterior layer covering its anterior surface, on which it is continuous with that portion of peritonaeum which has descended from the diaphragm, and with that which is also con- tinued from the spleen to the stomach. The perito- naeum having thus enclosed the stomach and its vessels between the two layers of the lesser omentum, we next observe that these laminae having passed the great cur- vature of the stomach touch each other, and being joined by the peritonaeum from the lower end of the spleen, de- scend under the name of the gastro-colic or the great omentum, to the lower part of the abdomen : in general it descends lower on the left side than on the right; it then turns on itself, and ascends obliquely backwards to the arch of the colon, along the convex edge of w'hich its laminae separate to enclose this intestine and its ves- sels ; along the concave edge of the colon these laminae again unite, and increasing in density form that process which is called the transverse meso-colon, w'hich passes backwards to the spine : opposite the duodenum this process separates into an ascending and descending layer ; the inferior division of the duodenum lies be- tween these; the ascending layer proceeds in front of the lower and middle divisions of the duodenum, up to the back part of the right lobe of the liver, where it be- comes continuous with the peritonaeal tunic of that vis- cus and with the posterior layer of the lesser omentum which is descending along the back part of the hepatic vessels. The descending layer of the transverse meso- colon expands into each lumbar region, in which it at- taches the lumbar portions of the colon by a duplica- ture called the right and left lumbar meso-colon ; in the centre the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon adheres to the vertebral column, and to the great ves- sels which lie upon it, and is thence reflected forwards and downwards over the small intestines and their ves- sels, and returns around these to the spine, thus form-

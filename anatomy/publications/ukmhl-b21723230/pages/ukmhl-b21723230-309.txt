291 is a narrow membranous and ligamentous band extend- ing along each side of the whole spinal cord, its superior extremity is attached to tlie dura mater at the foramen magnum ; its internal edge is straight, and is connected to the pia mater along the side of the spinal cord in the space between the anterior and posterior roots of the spi- nal nerves ; its external edge is serrated and attached by several pointed processes to the inner surface of the dura mater, near the foramina for the passage of the nerves ; each of these processes lies between the anterior and pos- terior fasciculi of the nerves ; its inferior extremity is in- serted into the ligamentous substance on the body of the fourth or fifth lumbar vertebra. The ligamentum denti- culatum serves to separate the roots of the spinal nerves, also to connect or fix the spinal cord laterally. The pia mater in the spinal canal is more dense than in the cranium, it adheres so closely to the spinal cord as to appear to c.ompress it, wâ€™hich is evident when the cord is cut across ; it is not so uniformly vascular as it is on the brain, very large and tortuous vessels, however, ex- tend along its whole length. The Medulla Spinalis extends from the foramen magnum, where it is continuous with the medulla ob- longata as far as the second lumbar vertebra, where it ends in a lash of nerves called cauda equina ; this or- gan is almost cylindrical; its transverse diameter ex- ceeds the antero-posterior; a deep narrow fissure ex- tends along the median line posteriorly, and a broad superficial groove anteriorly ; at first the medulla spina- lis is rather contracted or smaller than the medulla ob- longata ; but from the fifth cervical to the first dorsal vertebra it is smaller than in any other situation ; it then again swells out into an oval bulbous expansion which terminates at the second lumbar vertebra in a point, from which the remains of the ligamenta dentata ex- tend ; this lower extremity of the spinal cord is some- times round, sometimes bifid : the two enlargements of the spinal cord correspond to the origins of the largest nerves, viz. those to supply the upper and the lower extremity. The medulla spinalis appears to consist of two symmetrical portions united at the bottom of the 0 2

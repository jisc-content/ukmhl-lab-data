426 phisis pubis is not so deep, the sciatic tuberosities are directed more outwards, and the acetabula are more dis- tant from each other; the male pelvis is deeper, nar- rower, and stronger. The dimensions of the male and female pelvis are given by Meckel as follows, tom. 1. p. 473. In the Female. Inches. Lines. In the Male. Inches. Lines.

In the foetus each os innominatum is developed from three points of ossification, one in the iliac fossa, one in the sciatic tubercle, and one near the spine of the pubis; these three soon unite in the cotyloid cavity. Some years after birth the iliac crest is developed as a distinct epiphysis, the sciatic tubercle and anterior inferior spine of the ilium are also covered by distinct plates of bone, and in some the angle of the pubis; in some females also, a plate of bone or epiphysis constitutes the spine of the pubis and occasionally grows so large and remains so moveable, as to resemble the rudiments of a marsupial bone. In the foetus, the pelvis is very small and deep, and narrow transversely; the true and false are nearly in the same line, the acetabula are nearer the middle line and look more outwards, they are not beneath the pelvis as in the adult, hence the thigh bones in the in- fant cannot support or balance the weight of the trunk.

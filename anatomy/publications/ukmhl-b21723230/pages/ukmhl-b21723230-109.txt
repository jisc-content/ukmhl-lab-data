91 cularly along the inner side of the arm, so as to overlap the brachial vessels and nerves: as it descends it ad- heres to the lateral ridges of the humerus, which lead to the condyles ; these connexions are named inter-mus- cular ligaments; the internal is augmented by a pro- longation of the coraco-brachialis tendon, and the ex- ternal by fibres from the deltoid : the fascia of the fore- arm we shall examine afterwards. Between the inte- guments and fascia of the arm we notice two cutaneous veins, the cephalic on the outer, and the basilic on the inner side; the cephalic w’ill be found hereafter to com- mence about the thumb, and to ascend along the ra- dial side of the forearm, and having passed the elbow joint, it is now seen continuing its course up the arm, at first on the outer side of the biceps, and afterwards between the deltoid and great pectoral muscles to the clavicle, beneath which it sinks to join the axillary vein; the cephalic vein is unaccompanied by nerves in its course up the arm, but in the dissection of the forearm the external cutaneous nerve will be seen closely con- nected with it. The basilic vein will be found to com- mence about the little finger, to ascend along the ulnar side of the forearm, and to pass over the elbow joint; it is now seen continuing its course on the inner side of the biceps, between the skin and fascia, and about the middle of the arm it perforates the latter, to join one of the deep brachial veins; in some it continues superficial as high 'as the axilla, where it joins the axillary vein; the basilic vein in the arm is accompa- nied by the cutaneous nerves of Wrisberg, which having escaped from the intercostal branches of the 2d and 3d dorsal nerves, and passed across the axilla, are then distributed to the integuments on the inner side of the arm; inferiorly the internal cutaneous branch of the brachial plexus accompanies this vein, and con- tinues with it along the forearm; dissect off the fascia and cellular membrane from the muscles of the shoulder and arm. The muscles of the shoulder are the deltoid, supra and infra spinatus, teres minor and major, and 8ub-8capularis; those of the arm are the biceps, coraco- brachialis, brachialis anticus and triceps;—first examine the muscles of the shoulder.

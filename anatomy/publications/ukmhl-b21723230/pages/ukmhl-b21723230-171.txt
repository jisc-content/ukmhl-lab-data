stricted appetirance around ihe stomach, as if dividing it into two portions ; the circular fibres again increase in thickness as they approach the pylorus ; these fibres do iiot form perfect circles ; the extremities of each fasci- culus turn obliquely to one side ; the third set of fibres take a very irregular or oblique direction ; they are most distinct on the great end, or cul de sac, and appear as a continuation of the circular fibres of the oesophagus. Beneath the muscular tunic is the second lamina of cel- lular tissue, which contains the minute divisions of the nerves and vessels of the stomach, and has been, by .some, called the nervous coat of the stomach. The in- ternal, or mucous or villous coat is very soft, and of a pale red or rose colour, sometimes interspersed with such very vascular patches as might lead the inexperienced to mistake them for the effects of inflammation : in order to examine this tunic of the stomach, this organ should be removed from the subject, everted and washed. This membrane will be found covered with a viscid fluid, and thrown into numerous rugae, and will appear very different from that lining the oesophagus ; at the pylorus it forms n circular fold, which is thin and floating; external to this is a circular fasciculus of muscular fibres, wdiich have a peculiar dense feel: this fold of mucous membrane nar- rows the opening into the duodenum, and wâ€™hen assisted by the surrounding muscular fibres, can perfectly inter- cept the passage from the stomach into the intestine ; in the cellular tunic, external to this membrane, particularly along the curvatures, are many small mucous glands, which open on the mucous surface ; these are the glan- dulcB Brunnerii: the mucous coat of the stomach secretes the fluid called the gastric juice, wdiich is generally be- lieved to have the remarkable properties of being power- fully solvent and anti-putrescent. In the stomach the food undergoes the first important change in digestion, being here converted into a soft homogeneous pulpy mass, called chyme. The duodenum is the next portion of the alimentary canal; this is the first and shortest division of the small intestines ; it e.xtends from the pylorus to the root of the mesentery, where the jejunum commences ; it lies partly in the right hypochondriac, and partly in tlie right him-

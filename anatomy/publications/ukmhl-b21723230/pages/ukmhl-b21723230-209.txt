191 and pass it again and again along the urethra into that cavity: he will soon perceive how apt the point of the instrument is to descend into the sinus of the bulb, and the necessity of depressing r.he handle of the staff, in order to raise the point into the membranous part of the urethra; at the same time he should observe, that the latter is about an inch below the arch of the pubes, and that, therefore, the point of the instrument is not to be too much elevated, otherwise it may lacerate the upper part of the urethra, and injure some large veins that may be found in this situation. The student ma)*^ now also examine what occupies the space between the urethra and the pubes ; immediately above that canal is the upper portion of the triangular ligament, attached 'to the crura penis; behind this ligament are one or two large veins from the dorsum of the penis, these enter the pelvis along the upper surface of the prostate gland ; above these is a smooth dense ligament, the pubic liga- ment, w'hich is attached to the lower edge of the sym- physis pubis, and rounds off the angle between the op- posite rami. Posterior to the levator ani, and overlapped by the glutaeus maximus, is the following small muscle : CocCYGEUS, triangular, at the inferior and posterior part of the pehds, behind and above the levator ani, arises narrow from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium, the fibres expand along the inner or lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, and are inserted, fleshy and ten- dinous, into the extremity of the sacrum and side of the coccyx; Use, to support the os coccygis and to assist in closing the inferior and posterior part of the pelvis ; this muscle is between the levator ani and the glutaeus maximus; it is more distinctly seen within the pelvis. Next let the student divide the central point of the perineeum, separate the rectum from the bulb, and draw the former a little downwards from the bladder and prostate gland ; he will thus expose the inferior or pos- terior surface of the neck of the bladder, the flat pos- I terior surface of the prostate gland, also the vesicuhe I seminales, the terminations of the vasa deferentia, and 1 the commencement of the urethra, but the most im- portant part to direct the attention to, is a small trian- A

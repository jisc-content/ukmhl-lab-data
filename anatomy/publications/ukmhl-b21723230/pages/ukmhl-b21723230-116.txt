98 the great pectoral aad deltoid; not unfrequently thi* muscle has another origin from the humerus below its head; in some a fasciculus unites it to the coraco-bra- chialis, and in others to the brachiaeus anticus muscle, which lies behind it. The belly of the biceps is super- ficial, and lies on the brachialis anticus: the brachial artery descends along its internal border, and somewhat overlapped by it, in the middle and lower part of the arm. This muscle or its tendon will serve as a guide in the living subject, in case we are required to tie this vessel, but superiorly the eoraco-brachialis inten'enes: the semilunar fascia is extended over the trunk of this artery and nerve, and affords them some, but not a con- stant protection, in the operation of venaesection in the median basilic vein which vein is supei-ficial to this fascia, but parallel, and often so close to the artery as to expose the latter to some degree of danger in that operation. Brachialis Anticus or Externus, improperly called by some Internus, arises from the centre of the humerus by two fleshy slips, one on either side of the in- sertion of the deltoid, from the forepart of the bone down to the condyles, and on each side as far as the intermus- cular ligaments ; the fibres descend converging, pass an- terior to the elbow joint, adhere to the synovial membrane, and are inserted % a strong tendon into the coronoid pro- cess of the ulna, and into a rough surface on this bone beneath that process. Use, to flex the forearm, and in doing so it draws the synovial membrane out of the angle of the joint; it also strengthens this articulation in its extended state, by pressing the ulna against the hume- lus, and supporting the joint in front: this muscle is covered by the biceps and by the brachial vessels and neives; external to the biceps it is superficial; its e.Ktemal head is the longer, and lies between the deltoid and se- cond head of the triceps ; the internal separates the del- toid from the coraco-brachialis; the tendon passes deep into the hollow at the elbow, behind the tendon of the biceps, and is inserted on its internal side : a fleshy fasci- culus often unites this muscle and the biceps about the middle of the arm.

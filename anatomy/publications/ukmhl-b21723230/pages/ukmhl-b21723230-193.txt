DISSECTION OF THE DEEP MUSCLES OF TUB ABDOMEN. Diaphragm fe exposed by dissecting; off the peri- tonaeum ; it separates the abdomen from the thorax, be- ing concave towards the former cavity, convex towards the latter ; it may be divided into two portions, a supe- rior broad portion (the true diaphragm) and the infe- rior lesser portion, or the appendices or crura of the diaphragm. The superior true diaphragm is broad, thiir, and nearly circular; it arises by distinct fleshy fasciculi, from the posterior surface of the xiphoid cartilage, and from the internal surface of the cartilages of the last true, and of all the false ribs; these fasciculi indigitate with those of the transversalis muscle ; between the extremity of the last rib and the side of the spine, it arises from the upper part of a strong aponeurosis, which covers the quadrates lumborum muscle ; this is the anterior lamina of the tendon of the transversalis ; the upper edge of this fascia being very tense, particu- larly when the twelfth rib is everted, and appearing to be extended as a distinct ligament between this bone and the first lumbar vertebra, has received the name of the ligamentum arcuatum; it is not a distinct ligament ; it may, however, be named the external oxyh/se ligamentum arcuatum, to distinguish it from a true and distinct liga- ment, which extends from the transverse process of the first to the body of the second lumbar vertebra: this may lie named the true ox internal ligamentum arcuatum ; its concavity looks downwards, and extends across the upper extremity of the psoas magnus and the sympathetic nerve ; from the convex edge of this ligament the diaphragm next arises ; from this extensive origin the fibres pass in different directions, the anterior backwai'ds and upwards to the edge of the cordiform tendon, the middle upwards and inwards, and then a little downwards, to the lateriJ borders of the central tendon, and the posterior fibres pass forwards and upwards to the posterior edge of the tendon ; the anterior fibres are the shortest, the lateral

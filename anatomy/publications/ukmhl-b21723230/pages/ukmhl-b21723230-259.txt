241 and fore-part of the leg;, as will be described in the dis- section of that region. The posterior tibial nerve ac- companies the popliteal vessels through the space of that name, which space the student should next exa- mine. The popliteal space is situated behind the knee-joint, extending upwards for about one-fourth of the thigh, and downwards for about one-sixth of the leg: it is somewhat oval, is bounded internally by the inner ham- string, and the internal head of the gastrocnemius; externally by the biceps, external head of the gastrocne- mius, and the plantaris; it is covered by the integu- ments and by a strong fascia, which, derived from the fascia lata, is strengthened by adhering to the condyles of the femur, and to the adjoining tendons ; this fascia serves to approximate the sides of this region, and thus to give to it a considerable depth. The popliteal space is bounded before by the flat surface of the femur, by the back part of the joint covered by the ligament of Winslow, by the head of the tibia, and by the popli- taeus muscle; in this region are contained the termi- nating branches of the sciatic nerve, the popliteal ar- ter)' and vein with their branches; also some lymphatic glands and much adipose substance. The nerves are superficial and external to the vessels, that is, nearer to the biceps; the vessels are close to the bone, and near to the semi-membranosus muscle, the vein being superficial and a little to the outer side of the artery; two or three lymphatic glands are connected to the latter; and a quantity of fat, which is of a peculiar soft consistence, intervenes between the nerve and vessels. The course of the peronaeal nerve has been already noticed; the posterior tibial nerve descends nearly ver- tically between the heads of the gastrocnemius, runs be- neath the solseus, and over the poplitaeus, and then ac- companies the posterior tibial vessels down the leg, and along the inner side of the heel to the sole of the foot, in which course it shall be examined afterwards; in the ham this nerve sends off muscular branches, also the posterior or external saphenus nerve, which accompa- nies the posterior saphena vein along the back of the leg, M

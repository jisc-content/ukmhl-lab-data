Under this head we shall examine not only the globe of the eye but its appendages ; these are the eyelids, the lachrymal apparatus, and the muscles of the orbit. The muscles of the orbit are seven in number, viz. the levator palpebrae superioris, the obliquiis superior and inferior, and the four recti; to obtain a satisfactory view of these muscles, the roof and a considerable portion of the external side of the orbit must be removed ; then the periosteum having been divided, the first muscle ap- pears. Levator Palpebral Superioris is the highest muscle in the orbit; it arises narrow and tendinous from ^ the upper edge of the foramen opticum, passes forwards and outw'ards beneath the frontal nerve, and becoming broader, bends down in front of tbe eye ; it then ends in a dense cellular expansion which is inserted into the su- perior border of the tarsal cartilage and into the superior palpebral sinus of the conjunctiva behind the palpebral ligament. Use, to elevate and retract into the orbit the upper eye-lid. Obliquus Superior, at the upper and inner part of the orbit, arises on the inner side of the preceding, passes forwards along the os planum, ends in a round tendon which plays through the fibre cartilaginous pul- ley w'hich is attached to the inner angle of the os fron- tis; this tendon is then reflected backwards, outwards, and dow'nwards, between the superior rectus and the eye, and then becoming broad and thin, is inserted into the sclerotic coat between the superior and external recti, about midw’ay betiveen the entrance of the nerve and the insertion of the superior rectus. Use, to draw’

cular fibre adheres; the crurseus descends close to the femur to its inferior third, the 'fibres then incline for- wards, become tendinous posteriorly, and are separated from the bone by a large bursa, and by a considerable quantity of fat; inserted into the upper and outer edge of the patella, also into the synovial membrane of the knee behind the vasti, particularly the external, to which it is here intimately united. Use, to assist the vasti and the rectus in extending the leg. This muscle is covered by the rectus and the vasti; from the latter it can only be separated superiorly by tearing a few mus- cular fibres, and tracing some large nerves and vessels, that pass between them. The large bursa, which is situated behind the lower part of this muscle, is at- tached to and frequently communicates with the syno- vial membrane of the joint; a few muscular fibres are generally attached to this membrane, and have been described as a distinct muscle, the Sub-crur.^l or Capsular ; this arises from the anterior surface of the^ femur, about its inferior fourth, passes forwards and*, downwards, and is inserted into the synovial membrane. Use, to raise the synovial membrane in extension of the leg, so as to prevent its being contused by the patella. Gracilis, flat, long, and thin, broad and fleshy- above, round and tendinous below, situated at the inner side of the thigh, immediately beneath the inte- guments and fascia; arises by a thin short tendon from the lower half of the symphysis, and from the inner edge of the descending ramus of the pubis; it soon be- comes fleshy, and descends vertically, one edge directed forwards, the other backwards, and its surfaces looking one inwards, the other outwards; about the inferior fifth of the thigh it ends in a round tendon which passes behind the inner condyle, and then turns forwards along with the tendon of the sartorius, behind and beneath which it lies ; inserted into the superior part of the in- ternal surface of the tibia, uniting with the sartorius and semi-tendinosus. Use, to adduct the leg and thigh, to bend the knee, and turn the leg and foot inwards. The origin of the gracilis is between* the triceps and the crus penis; its whole course is superficial, except

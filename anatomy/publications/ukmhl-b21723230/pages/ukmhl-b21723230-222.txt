204^ cremaster muscle; as it passes through the internal ring it hooks round the epigastric artery, being separated from it by the spermatic artery alone ; the vas deferens next passes over the psoas and iliac muscles, the external iliae artery and vein ; it then bends over the obliterated hypo- gastric artery and descends internal to it; and in the same manner it next crosses over the ureter, so as to lie at first anterior to that tube, or between it and the blad- der, and then to descend along its internal side ; the vas deferens then runs between the bladder and rectum, near to its fellow, and internal to the vesicula seminalis, as far as the prostate gland, which it perforates in the direction before mentioned. This vessel has a peculiar hard wiry feel like whip-cord : its caliber is small; its coats are two in number, an internal mucous, and an ex- ternal, very thick, firm and white, like cartilage. Be- tween the vesiculse each vas deferens is flattened, en- larged, and often convoluted; when it enters the prostate it again contracts, and its firm external tunic ceases. In some a second duct will be found to leave the testis and to run for some distance parallel to the vas deferens, which in some cases it will join, while in others it will he found to end in a cul de sac. The spermatic cord extends from the epididymis to the internal abdominal ling; it consists of the vas deferens, spermatic artery, veins, and nerves ; this fasciculus of vessels is covered by loose cellular membrane, and by the cremaster mus- cle : beneath the latter the vessels of the cord will be found joined together by a fine but tolerably dense mem- brane, named the Tunica Vaginalis of the cord; this membrane is the remains of that portion of peritonaeum which in the foetus accompanied the spermatic vessels of the scrotum, and which after birth lost its serous charac- ters, and became converted into condensed cellular mem- brane ; this covering is strengthened by that prolonga- tion of the fascia transversalis which is continued from the internal abdominal ring along the spermatic ves- gels.â€”The spermatic artery arises from the abdominal aorta below the renal artery, and not unfrequently from the latter ; it descends along the psoas muscle, passes through the internal abdominal ring on tlie outer side

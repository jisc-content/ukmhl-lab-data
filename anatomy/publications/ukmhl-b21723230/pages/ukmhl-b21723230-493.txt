475 side is flat to meet the cuneiform, and its external to meet the scaphoid ; its anterior surface is larger than its posterior, and it projects a little into the palmar arch. The cuneiform or pyramidal bone. The base of this wedge-shaped bone looks outwards, and articulates with the lunar, the apex inwards ; it is convex and smooth above to meet the carpal fibro cartilage ; concave and smooth below' to articulate with the unciform bone ; rough posteriorly and internally for ligaments ; anteriorly it presents a flat circular cartilaginous surface for the pisiform bone. The pisiform bone. This small pea-shaped bone is the smallest in the carpus, at the upper and inner part of which it is placed ; it is also on a plane anterior to the first row; it is articulated to the cuneiform bone by a small circular surface ; its circumference is rough for the attachment of ligaments ; the flexor carpi ulnaris is inserted into it above, and the abductor minimi digiti below'. The trapezium is the most external of the second row of the carpus ; it is concave above to meet the scaphoid, below it is convex from behind forw'ards, aud concave transversely, to support the metacarpal bone of the thumb; anteriorly it is marked w'ith a groove for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis ; internally it is articulated to the tra- pezoid, and beneath this by a small surface to the second metacarpal bone. The trapezoid is of a very irregular shape, and smaller than the trapezium ; above it is smooth and concave to meet the scaphoid, externally it articulates with the tra- pezium, internally w'ith the magnum, and inferiorly with the second metacarpal bone. The os magnum is the largest of the carpal bones ; it presents superiorly a round and hemispherical head, w'hich is received into the socket formed by the scaphoid and lunar bones ; this head is supported by a contracted neck, its greatest convexity is turned backwards and out- wards ; the inferior surface of the magnum is divided into three articulating surfaces ; these support the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones ; that for the third is the largest ; its posterior surface is broad and convex below, and a little concave above ; externally it joins

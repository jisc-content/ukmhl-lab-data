466 THE SUPEIIIOH EXTREMITIES. Each superior or thoracic extremity consists of the shoulder and forearm, wrist and hand ; the shoulder is composed of the clavicle and scapula, the arm of the humerus, the forearm of the radius and ulna, the wrist of the eight small carpal bones, the hand of the five metacarpal and fourteen phalangal bones. The Clavicle extends from the summit of the sternum obliquely across the first rib, upwards, backwards, and outwards to the acromion process of the scapula, it is curved somewhat like an italic S, particularly in the male, in the female it is straighter and longer, it consists, like all long bones, of two extremities and a body or shaft; the internal or sternal end is thick, it presents a triangular articulating surface, inclined forwards and downwards, convex from above downwards, concave from before backwards, large above and before, small and pointed below and behind, the circumference is rough for the attachment of ligaments; the body is nearly cylindrical towards the sternal, but flat and ex- panded towards the acromial end, smooth above and mostly subcutaneous, inferiorly it is rough, and presents about an inch from the sternal end, a ridge or proces.s for the rhomboid ligament, external to this is a groove for the subclavian muscle, in which is a foramen for the nutritious vessels, and near the scapular end is a rough ridge leading backwards and outwards for the attach- ment of the coraco-clavicular ligaments ; its anterior edge is convex in the inner half, and gives attachment to the great pectoral muscle ; the outer half is concave, the deltoid is attached to it; the posterior is smooth and concave in the inner half towards the great vessels, and rough and convex externally for the attachment of the trapezius muscle; the acromial end of the clavicle passes over the coracoid process upw’ards and. back- wards, is flat and broad, rough above and below, and perforated by vessels ; it presents at its termination a small articulating surface for the acromion scapul®; this surface is oval from before backwards, and cut ob- liquely from above and from without doumwards and inwards, its aspect is outwards, forwards, and downwards.

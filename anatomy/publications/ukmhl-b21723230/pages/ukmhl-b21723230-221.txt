203 wth each other, and with the vessels and nerves of the ^land : this structure receives the name oi Rete Testis, which IS therefore placed near the posterior part of the S^and, and enclosed between the laminm of the cornus highmorianum ; from the upper part of this tissue five or SIX tortuous vessels ascend obliquely backwards, pierce the tunica albuginea, and arrive at the head of the epidi- dymis ; here they increase in size, and become coiled or involuted ; these are the vasa efferentia or coni vascu- tosi: they all terminate in the head or globus major of the epididymis, and unite into one small duct (the vas deferens), which is twisted and coiled over and over ao ain in a most extraordinary and peculiar manner. The body and _globus minor of the epididymis are solely composed of this convoluted vessel, which by care may be unra- velled to a great extent: the convolutions of this tube, of wh^ich the epididymis thus consists, are connected to each othei by fine cellular tissue and by the reflected tunica aginalis ; the epididymis has no fibrous capsule like the f!n fJ extremity the vas deferens at ength escapes, and increasing in size and density, this duct bends upwards along the inner side of the epididy- mis, and a litde above the head of the latter it becomi connected to the spermatic vessels and cremaster mus- cle with these It continues its course obliquely upwards Md outwards along the ing-uinal channel, and through the internal abdominal ring: it here separates from the sper- Se towards the spine, while the vas deferens passes backwards, inwards, and um peritonm- f T T the side and infenor fundus of which it runs internal to the ve- converging to its fellow; at (he thTn t f deferens joins of thT/f corresponding vesicula, and the union of these forms the ductus ejaculatorius communis, obliquely forwards and urethra ’ ’“to the prostatic portion of the ®’de of the verumontanum. While the e erens IS contained in the spermatic cord, it lies posterior to the spermatic arteries and veins, and to the

412 spine for the attachment of the recti muscles ; the spinal hole is very large and divided into two by the transverse ligament, which arises from two tubercles placed on the inner side of the superior articulating processes ; the an- terior portion, small, receives the tooth-like process of the second vertebra, the posterior forms the spinal canal, the lamince are thick and round behind, but, near the arti- culating processes, are grooved above for the vertebral artery, and below for the second spinal nerve; before these notches ai'e the articular processes, the superior horizon- tal, concave, oval from before backwards, look upwards and inwards, and receive the occipital condyles ; the in- ferior are nearly flat, circular, and inclined a little inwards; the transverse processes are long, and end in an obtuse point, the anterior root is slender, the posterior is long and large, the hole between these is larger than in the other vertebrae, and is directed upwards and backwards ; from this a groove for the vertebral artery winds backwards round the superior articular process. In the adult the atlas is very .compact ; in the foetus its ossification takes place from five points, one for the anterior arch, two for the posterior, and one for each lateral part. The axis or second vertebra is remarkable for the length of its body, which has anteriorly a central ridge between two depressions for muscles, and from its upper part there rises by a sort of a neck, a large, round, dentiform {odon- toid) process, the forepart of which is received into the small articulating cavity on the anterior arch of the atlas, while posteriorly it presents a small, smooth convexity, which moves against the smooth surface of the transverse ligament of the atlas; the apex is rather pointed, to it and to the sides of this process the lateral or check ligaments are attached ; the lamince are very strong ; the superior notches are behind, the inferior before the articular pro- cesses ; the spinal hole is large and heart-shaped ; the spinous process is forked and very strong, its under sur- face is channelled ; the superior oblique processes are slightly convex, nearly horizontal, and look a little out- wards ; the inferior are smaller, flat, and look downwards and forwards ; the transverse processes are short, arise from the outside of the superior articular processes, are

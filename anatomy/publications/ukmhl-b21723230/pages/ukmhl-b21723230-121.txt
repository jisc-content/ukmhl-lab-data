103 from the forepart of the wrist, it ascends along the fore- arm beUveen the cephalic and basilic veins, and near the elbow divides into two or three branches: 1st, the median basilic, which ascends obliquely over the fascia of the biceps to join the basilic: 2d, t\\Q median cej)halic, which passes obliquely upwards and outAvards, and joins the cephalic vein; the third branch of the median, when present, sinks deep, and joins one of the deep veins. The internal cutaneous nen'e and its branches accompany the basilic vein, some passing anterior, others posterior to it; the external cutaneous, or musculo-cutaneous, in general lies behind the cephalic vein at the bend of the elbow, its branches afterwards twine around that vessel. The relation betAveen the cutaneous nert'es and veins is liable to great variety. The fascia of the forearm is very strong, particularly on the posterior part ; it consists of tendinous fibres, AA'hich run in every direction, connected on either side to the condyles, and to the muscles which are attached to these ; it receives an addition from the biceps before, and from the triceps behind; as it descends, it invests the limb so closely as to give it a certain form; it sends septa betAveen the different muscles, which give attach- ment to several fibres, and it adheres very closely to the ulna its whole length; inferiorly it is connected to the annular ligaments of the carpus. The anmilar liga- ments of the wrist appear formed in part by this fascia, strengthened by proper transverse fibres ; the posterior is attached to the styloid process of the ulna internally, and to that of the radius externally ; it binds doAvn the extensor tendons. The anterior annular ligament is much stronger ; it is attached to the unciform and pisi- form bones internally, to the scaphoid and trapezium ex- ternally ; its upper edge is connected to the fascia of the forearm, its loAver to that of the hand: this liga- ment, together with the carpus, forms a canal or ring for the passage of the flexor tendons. The integu- ments of the hand are thin posteriorly, and cover seve- ral cutaneous veins ; anteriorly they are dense, and the subjacent cellular tissue granulated and firm ; on the back of the hand a very thin aponeurosis exists, but anteriorly, there is a remarkable strong fascia, the

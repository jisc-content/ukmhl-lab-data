58 SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE AXILLA. The Axilla is a conical cavity, the apex superiorly at the coracoid process and clavicle, the base below, formed by skin and a thick fascia; it is bounded anteri- orly by the great and lesser pectoral muscles, internally by the serratus magnus and the ribs, externally by the scapula and subscapular muscle, and posteriorly by the serratus and latissimus dorsi. This region con- tains several lymphatic glands, vessels and nerves, and a quantity of loose cellular and adipose tissue, which is continued from the neck beneath the clavicle, and often presents a watery reddish appearance. When the pectoral muscles have been divided, and some cel- lular membrane removed, the axillary vein first ap- pears ; at tlie upper part of the axilla this vessel is in- ternal and anterior to the artery; inferiorly it is directly over this vessel, and more closely connected to it than above : this vein receives the cephalic vein, and several branches from the parietes of the thorax, and from the shoulder. The axillary artery may be next seen, taking an oblique course downwards and outwards through this space, and giving off thoracic branches from its internal side; and from its external, the sub- scapular and circumflex arteries ; behind the artery, at the upper part of the axilla, the brachial plexus of nerves is seen; as this descends it becomes more and lAore closely connected to it, and at the lower part of this cavity the branches of the plexus h'ave almost surroimded the artery. This plexus may be seen dividing into several branches; superiorly, it gives off the thoracic, supra and subscapular; and lower down it divides into the external and internal cutaneous, the median, ulnar, radial or spiral, and articular or circumflex. The gene- ral distribution of these branches will be noticed in the dissection of the upper extremity, and for their parti- cular description see Anatomy of the Nenâ€™ous System. At the lower part of the axilla the artery may be ob- served in general to lie between the two roots of the

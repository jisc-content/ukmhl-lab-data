398 per part of the coracoid process; these ligaments are united posteriorly and externally, anteriorly they are distinct. LIGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA. These are two in number, an anterior and posterior. The anterior or the deltoid, or coraco-acromial, arises broad from the coracoid process, passes upwards and outwards, and is inserted narrow into the point of the acromion process. The posterior or coracoid liga- ment arises from the costa of the scapula behind the notch, passes forwards, and is inserted into the base of the coracoid process ; it converts the notch into a foramen; this ligament is sometimes wanting, then the notch is completed into a hole by bone: the supra-sca- pular nerve usually passes below this ligament, while the vessels of this name run above it. HUMERO-SCAPULAB. ARTICULATION. The head of the humerus is retained in the glenoid cavity by tlie capsular and coraco-humeral ligaments, and by a synovial membrane; the glenoid cavity is deepened by a fibrous border, which is partly derived from the tendon of the biceps. The capsular ligament arises around the neck of the scapula, increases in size, encircles the head of the hu- merus, and is inserted into its neck ; it is dense above and below, thin internally and externally; this capsule is very loose and long, the tendons of the capsular mus- cles are identified with it. The coraco-humeral ligament extends from the cora- coid^yjirocess to the anterior part of the great tube- rosity, where it becomes confounded with the capsule and with the tendon of the supra-spinatus. The syno- pial membrane is reflected over the glenoid surface around the glenoid ligament, lines the capsule, and covers the head of the humerus, and also lines the bici- pital groove.

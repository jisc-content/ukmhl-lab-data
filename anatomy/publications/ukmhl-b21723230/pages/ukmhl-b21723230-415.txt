397 superiorly, where the thyroid nen'e and vessels pass through. STERXO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. The clavicle is connected to the sternum by an an- terior, posterior, inferior, and inter-clavicular ligament, also by an inter-articular cartilage and two synovial mem- branes ; the anterior ligament arises from the end of the clavicle, descends inwards, and is inserted into the fore-part of the sternum; the posterior ligament takes a course parallel to the preceding, behind the joint; the inferior or the costo-clavicular or rhomboid ligament, passes from the lower surface of the sternal end of the clavicle, and is inserted into the cartilage of the first rib; the inter-clavicular extends from the posterior surface of one clavicle to the other, the cervical fascia is attached to the upper edge of this ligament; the in- ter-articular cartilage is thin below, and attached to the sternum, thick above and attached to the clavicle; a synovial membrane is connected to each surface of this cartilage. SCAPULO-CLA VICULAR ARTICULATION. The oval end of the clavicle is connected to the end of the acromion process by a superior and inferior liga- ment, which are attached to th? surfaces of each bone, there is also a synovial membrane between both ; some- times there is an inter-articular cartilage in this articula- tion ; about an inch internal to this joint the clavicle is connected to the coracoid process by two fasciculi of li- gamentous fibres, which do not properly belong to this articulation, they are the conoid and trapezoid liga- ments. The conoid is the smaller of the two, its base is at- tached to a tubercle on the lower surface of the clavi- cle, its apex to the broad part of the coracoid process. 'Fhe trapezoid is more anterior and external, it is also broader and stronger than the conoid, it is about an inch distant from the articulation, it is attached above to an oblique line on the clavicle, and below to the up-

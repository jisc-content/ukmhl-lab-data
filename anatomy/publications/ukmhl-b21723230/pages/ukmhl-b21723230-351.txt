S3S neck, but it enters the chest in a deeper situation than the nen'e of the right side ; it descends between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and arriving at the arch of the aorta, divides into branches, some of which pass behind that vessel and join the cardiac ganglion ; others unite with the cardiac nerves from the sympathetic, or from the vagus and recurrent. The middle cardiac nerve on the right side is generally the largest of the cardiac nerves ; on the left side it is sometimes wanting, the in- ferior in such a case will be of a greater size ; it arises by several filaments from the middle cervical ganglion or from the sympathetic nerve about the middle of the neck; it descends either a single cord, or divided into several parallel filaments behind and internal to the carotid, and enters the thorax anterior to the subclavian artery ; it here is joined by large branches from the vagus and re- current nerves, it then descends obliquely inwards along the side of the arteria innominata, glides between the arch of the aorta and the division of the trachea, and ter- minates in the cardiac ganglion or plexus. On the left side the middle cardiac nerve sometimes arises from the inferior cervical ganglion ; it enters the chest along the subclavian arterj', and either joins the inferior cardiac nerve or enters the cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac neive or nerves proceed from the inferior cendcal gan- glion, and on the right side descend along the arteria in- nominata to the arch of the aorta, round which they pass to its fore-part, and terminate principally in the anterior cardiac plexus ; some branches pass between the aorta and pulmonary artery to the cardiac ganglion ; these in- ferior cardiac nerves communicate with the preceding, and with the vagus and its recurrent; they form an irre- gular network or plexus in their course to the aorta ; on the left side these nerves accompany the subclavian arte- ry and partly join the middle cardiac nerve, and partly the cardiac plexus. The cardiac plexus or cardiac gati- glion is situated behind the ascending aorta near its origin, and in front of the trachea and of the right pul- monary artery ; of a greyish colour and irregular form, it consists of a plexus of nerves formed by the cardiac nerves irom opposite sides, also by branches of the eighth pair and the recurrent nenâ€™es ; in the meshes of this plexus

231 by a considerable depth of fat, and by a thin fascia; as the latter approaches the upper edge of the muscle, it becomes more strong and adherent, and is thence extended over the anterior part of the glutseus medius, to which it adheres very closely, and is then inserted into the crest and anterior spine of the ilium. The glu- taeus maximus covers all the muscles on the posterior part of the pelvis, except the anterior portion of the glutaeus medius, which is covered by the fascia just now men- tioned ; its insertion into the linea aspera is above the short head of the biceps, and between the vastus exter- nus and adductor magnus ; a very large bursa lines its tendon, and is expanded over the trochanter and a por- tion of the vastus externus ; it is very thin; it usually con- tains much synovial fluid, and it is frequently intersected by tendinous bands ; a smaller bursa is often situated be- low it, between the tendons of the glutaeus maximus and vastus externus. Divide this muscle by a perpendicular incision, and separate the edges ; several muscles, vessels, &c. may be noticed, having the following relation to each other: com- mencing above, we see the glutaeus medius muscle, be- neath this, the pyriformis, and between these, the glu- taeal vessels and the superior glutaeal nerve ; below the pyriform muscle we remark the great sciatic and some smaller nerves, also the sciatic and pudic vessels, all es- caping from the pelvis by the lower part of the sciatic notch ; next in order are the gemini muscles surrounding the tendon of the obturator internus; below these is the quadratus femoris, parallel to the superior fibres of the adductor magnus ; the great sciatic ligament, the tuber ischii, and the superior attachment of the hamstring mus- cles are seen in this dissection, also several small arteries and veins, and a considerable quantity of loose watery cellular tissue, which surrounds the sciatic nerve in its course through the depression Between the trochanter and tuber ischii. Glut/T.us Medius, triangular, flat, thinner than tho last described muscle, is exposed by dividing the glu- ,r. tseus maximus and dissecting off the strong fascia which extends from its anterior edge to the crest of the ilium, arises by fleshy and aponeurotic fibres from the deep

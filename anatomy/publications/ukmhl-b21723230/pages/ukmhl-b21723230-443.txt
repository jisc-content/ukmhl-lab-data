425 the abdomen ; this line is more distinct posteriorly than anteriorly ; this abdominal or upper strait of the pelvis is somewhat elliptical, the greatest diameter being trans- verse ; it is measured by four lines or diameters; 1st, the antero-posterior or sacro-pubic is smallest on account of the projection of the sacrum; 2nd, the transverse or iliac which crosses the first at right angles and is the greatest; 3d and 4th, the oblique which lead from one ilio sacral articulation to the opposite ilio pubal emi- nence, or the cotyloid wall. Above this strait the great or false pelvis expands and is deficient in bone ante- riorly, being only closed by the abdominal muscles. Beneath this strait is the true pelvis, w'hich is a sort of curved canal longer than the false pelvis and w'ider about the centre than at either strait, with smooth walls, concave posteriorly from above downwards, concave an- teriorly in the transverse direction, and on eithel side nearly plane ; the sacrum and coccyx bound it poste- riorly, the pubes and thyroid foramina anteriorly, and on either side a portion of the ilium and ischium, the sciatic notches and ligaments. The pelvis is placed in an oblique direction, its upper orifice looking forwards, so that if a line be passed horizontally from the upper border of the symphysis pubis backwards, it will meet the middle of the sacrum. The lower orifice looks back- wards and downw'ards, the axis of the tw'o orifices there- fore is not the same, that of the superior if produced would pass anterioily through the abdominal muscles, between the pubis and umbilicus, and posteriorly it would rest against the lower third of the sacrum; the axis of the lower strait if produced from below upwards would touch the promontory of the sacrum, these lines therefore will decussate near the centre of the pelvis and form an oblique angle forwards. The axis of the false pelvis is nearly vertical, while that of the true ca- vity is oblique from above and from before downwards and backwards. The female pelvis differs from the male in several circumstances, it is wider and larger, â€¢ but not so deep, the alae of the ilium are more expanded, the prominence of the sacrum is less, the upper strait is rounder and wider, the sacrum is broad and more concave, the pubic arch more round and open, the sym- I

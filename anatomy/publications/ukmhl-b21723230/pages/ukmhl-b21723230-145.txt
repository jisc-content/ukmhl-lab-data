127 observed to pass upwards arid inwards behind the supe- rior pillar of the ring towards the linea alba; these as- sume, in general, a triangular shape, and have received the name of the triangular ligament or fascia; the base is inferiorly at the linea ileo-pectinea; the apex is supe- rior and internal towards the linea alba, and is continuous with the external oblique tendon of the opposite side : this fascia senses to protect the abdomen in this region. Raise the external oblique, by dissecting off its serrated origins from tbe ribs, detach also its insertion from the crest of the ilium, and from the internal oblique muscle, cleaning, at the same time, the surface of the latter; thrOw the external oblique towards the opposite side, separating it as far forwards as its connexions will permit, that is, about half an inch internal to the linea semilunaris; divide its tendon transversely from the spine of the ilium, towards the lower third of the rectus, about an inch above the external ring, thus preserving Pou- part’s ligament and the external ring for further exami- nation, in relation to the anatomy of hernia. When the external oblique is raised, we see the inferior ribs, the inferior intercostal muscles, the internal oblique, and the cremaster. Obliquus Inteuxus, or Ascendens, is also situated at the anterior and lateral part of the abdomen, broader before than behind, and more fleshy below than above; it arises tendinous, but soon becomes fleshy, from the fascia lumborum, from all the crest of the ilium, and from the external third or fourth of Poupart’s ligament, the fibres diverge in a radiated manner; those from the lumbar fascia and posterior part of the ilium ascend ob- liquely forwards; those from the anterior part of the ilium pass transversely, and those from Poupart’s liga- ment descend obliquely inwards; the fibres continue fleshy further forw’ard than those of the external oblique; at the linea semilunaris they end in a flat tendon, which at the edge of the rectus divides into two layers to en- close this muscle; the anterior is united to the tendon of the external oblique, the posterior and thinner layer is joined to the tendon of the transversalis; about midway between the umbilicus and the pubis, the tendon of tbe internal oblique does not divide, but the whole passes in

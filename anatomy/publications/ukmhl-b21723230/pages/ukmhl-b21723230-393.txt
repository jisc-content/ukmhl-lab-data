375 The middle sacral artery arises from the back part of tlie aorta a little above the bifurcation ; it descends nearly in the median line close to the sacrum, sends its branches to this bone, and communicates with the lateral sacral arteries. ^Jhe common iliac arteries descend obliquely outwards as far as the ilio-sacral articulations, opposite which each divides into the internal and external iliac; the right iliac is longer than the left, and passes over the commence- ment of the vena cava. The internal iliac or hypogastric artery passes down- wards and forwards into the pelvis to the side and back part of the bladder, where it ends in a ligamentous sub- stance, which ascends first along the side of the bladder, and then behind the recti muscles as far as the umbilicus; the internal iliac artery gives off the following branches, ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, haemorrhoidal, vesical, uterine and vaginal, the glutaeal, sciatic, obturator, and pudic. 1st, The ilio-lumbar arises from the back part of the in- ternal iliac, passes outwards behind the external iliac ves- sels and the psoas muscle, into the substance of the iliacus intemus, in which it divides into ascending and descend- ing branches. 2nd, The lateral sacral descends ob- liquely inwards in front of the sacral holes, through which it sends branches to the spinal nerves, also to the pyriform muscle, and to communicate with the middle sacral. 3rd, The hcemorrhoidal are two or three branches of uncertain origin, they pass to the sides of the rectum and communicate with the superior and inferior hremor- rhoidal arteries. 4th, The vesical arteries arise from the iliac, or from some of its branches ; they ramify on the coats of the bladder ; the inferior also supply the parts about the neck of this organ. 5th, The uterine and va- yinal arteries either arise from the internal iliac or from some of its branches, and are distributed as their names imply. 6th, The glutceal artery passes backwards and outwards from the pelvis by the upper part of the sciatic notch, above the pyriform muscle, and divides into seve- ral branches, some of which supply the glutaeus maxi- mus, others pass forwards in a semicircular course towards the spine of the ilium, and supply the glutseus medius

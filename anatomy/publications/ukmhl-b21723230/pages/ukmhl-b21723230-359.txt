341 roof of the cavity may be broken or cut tlirough at the lovser and internal part of tlie squamous plate ; this ca- vity is placed between the meatus externus and the laby- rinth ; it is of au irregular figure, rather circular ; it presents on its internal side a tubercular eminence, named the promontory, and two foramina, one above, the other below that eminence ; the superior foramen, ox fenestra ovalis, is closed by a membrane, to which the base of the stapes bone is attached; this opening communicates with the vestibule ; the inferior or the foramen rotuvdum is also closed by a membrane, it communicates with the internal part of the cochlea or the scala tympani ; the posterior wall of the tympanum presents superiorly the opening of a short canal, which leads to the mastoid cells, these are of irregular form, and difler in different sub- jects ; beneath this is tho jyyramid, a small bony projec- tion, hollow, containing the muscle of the stapes ; be- neath the pyramid is the small foramen leading from the aqueduct of Fallopius, and transmitting the corda tym- pani. The tympanum presents anteriorly the openings of two canals, one superior containing the tensor tym- pani muscle, the other, the inferior, is the Eustachian tube; this descends obliquely forwards and inwards, and terminates by a trumpet-shaped mouth, behind the pos- terior nares, on a level with the inferior spongy bone ; this canal is small, and osseous posteriorly, anteriorly it is large and formed of membrane externally, and of a cuned fibro-cartilage internally ; it is lined by mucous membrane, which is prolonged from the pharynx into the tympanum ; through this tube the atmosphere can pass from the fauces into the tympanum, to support the latter on its internal surface. In the superior boundary of the tympanum are some small foramina for the passage of blood-vessels ; its inferior boundary presents the gle- noid fi.ssure, through which pass the corda tympani, the tendon of the laxator tympani, and the processus graci- lis of the malleus. Within the cavity of the tympanum are four small bones, first the malleus, attached to the membrana tympani, and resting on the second, the in- cus, one leg of which is connected to the thud, the or- bicular, which is articulated to the fourth, the stapes.

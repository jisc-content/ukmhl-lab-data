493 septa ; this sort of polypus varies very much in its size, some not being larger than a walnut, and others being larger than a childâ€™s head. Another sort of poh'pus forms in the uterus, which consists of an irregular bloody substance, with tattered processes hanging from it; when cut into it appears to be a spongy mass, holding large cells. Tlie most common part to which polypi adhere, is the fundus uteri, and sometimes they are found attached to the os tincse. Ovaria, The membrane covering or the substance of the ovary, are very rarely found inflamed, except when they are included in general peritonitis; when the inflammation proceeds from the uterus, it sometimes goes on to the formation of pus in the ovary. Dropsy. The most common disease in the ovary is dropsy, the whole substance of the ovarium is sometimes converted into a capsule containing fluid. When the ovaria have become dropsical, their natural structure has disappeared, and they are found converted into cells, communicating with one another by considerable open- ings, and very much enlarged : the ovaria are sometimes converted into a series of cysts, which have no commu- nication with each other; these cysts have been con- founded with hydatids, to which they bear some resem- blance ; they" are however very different; they have much firmer and less pulpy coats than hydatids, they contain a different kind of fluid, and they are differently connected among themselves. Hydatids either lie unconnected, or one large one encloses a number of small ones ; while ovarian cysts adhere to each other by broad surfaces, and do not enclose each other. The ovaria are sometimes found converted into cysts, holding large masses of fat, hair, and some teeth ; these substances appear to be ge- nerated by the internal membrane of the cyst; the hairs are most of them loose in the fatty substance, but many of them adhere to the inside of the capsule ; the teeth, which are not always perfect, are sometimes attached to the cyst, and at others, to an irregular mass of bone.

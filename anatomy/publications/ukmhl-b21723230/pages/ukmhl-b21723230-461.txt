liary ridges of the os-frontis to the roots of the pte- rygoid processes of the os-sphenoides; it presents the nasal spine and process of the os-frontis, the aethmoid fwne, the orbital plates of the os-frontis, hounded by its angular processes before, and by the orbital plates of the sphenoid behind; in this division are the su- pra-orbitd, the anterior and posterior orbital holes, the openings of the frontal and »thmoid cells, the optic and lacerated holes of the orbits, the vidian canals and the foramina rotunda. The middle division extends from the roots of the pterygoid to the styloid processes of the temporal bones, it presents the azygos process, the basilar process of the os-occipitis, the anterior points of the petrous portions of the temporal bones ; the spi- nous processes of the sphenoid, and the glenoid cavities of the temporal bones. The holes in this division are the oval, spinous, carotid, external, auditory glenoidal, and the Eustachian lubes. The posterior division ex- tends from the styloid processes of the temporal to the tuberosity of the occipital bone ; it presents the foramen magnum, the tn'o condyles, the jugular ridge, the sty- loid processes of the temporal bones, surrounded by their vaginal processes, the mamillary processes, the digastric pits, the inferior and superior transverse arches, the spine, protuberance and pits of the occipital bone: the foramina in this division are the stylo-mastoid, mas- toid, magnum, lacera postica, anterior and posterior condyloid. The skull is divided internally into the arch or vault and the base ; on the vault is to be observed the sulcus for the longitudinal sinus, the frontal crest, the grooves for the middle arteries of the dura mater, the depres- •sions for the convolutions of the brain, and for the gra- nulations or glandulae pacchionae ; the base of the skull is very uneven, and presents three portions on different planes, the anterior o^ frontal, the middle or spheno- temporal, and the posterior or occipital; the 1st is formed of the orbital plates of the frontal bone, the cribri- form plate of the ethmoid, and the lesser wings of the sphenoid ; the foramina in this division are the caecum, olfactory, and optic. The 2nd division is bounded before by the transverse spinous processes of the sphenoid, on

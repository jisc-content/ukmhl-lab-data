230 DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES OP THE IIIP. These are, the three glutsei, the pyriformis, the gemini, the two obturator, and the quadratus femoris. Glutxus Maximus covers the greater part of the pelvis, also the upper part of the thigh ; it is somewhat square, one edge being attached to the sacrum, the op- posite edge to the femur, and to the fascia lata, the other edges are directed one upwards and forwards, the other downwards and backwards. The inferior edge is thick and round, and covered by a great quantity of fat; this forms the fold of the nates. It is difficult to clean the surface of the glutaeus maximus, its fasciculi are so coarse and rough, this may be facilitated by dis- secting parallel to the fibres, that is, in a line drawn from the sacrum towards the great trochanter. This muscle arises by flestiy and short aponeurotic fibres, from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, from the rough surface between the crest and the superior semicircular ridge on this bone, from the posterior ilio-sacral ligaments and lumbar fascia, from the tuber- cles on the posterior surface of the sacrum, the side of the coccyx, and from the great sciatic ligament, which last it covers ; the fibres are collected into distinct fas- ciculi, which descend obliqiiely outwards and forwards, nearly parallel to each other, converging a little to- wards -the thigh ; the lower fibres are the longest, they all form a strong and dense mass, particularly below, and end in a flat and thick tendon, whose external surface is rough and course, but the internal smooth, and lined by a bursa which separates it from and allows it to glide over the great trochanter ; this tendon is inserted into a rough edge which leads from the trochanter to the linea aspera, also into the upper third of that line, and by a tendinous expansion into the fascia lata, co- vering the vastus externus muscle. Use, to extend the thigh, also to abduct and rotate it outwards, to support the pelvis and the trunk on the lower extremity, also to make tense the fascia lumborum and the fascia lata. The glutaeus maximus is covered by the integuments,

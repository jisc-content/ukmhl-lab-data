135 time, the spermatic canal will be found altered in many respects from its natural condition ; it rvill have become dilated and shortened, and the abdominal rings expanded and approximated so as to render it difficult to distin- guish the oblique from the direct inguinal hernia. In connexion with inguinal hernia, the student may next study the anatomy of the groin in reference to cru- ral hernia, or he may postpone this dissection until the contents of the abdomen have been examined and re- moved : we shall however here subjoin the description of the parts concerned in this disease : remove the integu- ments from the anterior part of the upper third of the thigh, the superficial fascia will be seen descending over Poupart’s ligament to invest the lower extremity; in the groin this fascia is very thick, and may be divided into several layers, which are separated by lymphatic glands and the superficial inguinal vessels; this fascia may be easily raised from the fascia lata on the outer and inner sides of the thigh, but in the middle of the groin and about an inch below Poupart’s ligament, these fasciae are almost inseparably joined ; when the superficial fascia shall have been dissected off the forepart of the thigh, %ve shall see several lymphatic glands, the saphena vein and some small blood-vessels lying on the fascia; in structure the latter more resembles the supe^ial, than the fascia lata; the form and boundaries of tpe inguinal region also may then be more distinctly seen; this space is triangular, the base is Poupart’s ligament; the apex is inferiorly, formed by the meeting of the Sartorius and adductor muscles ; the external side is very prominent, and consists of the sartorius, iliacus, rectus and other muscles, all covered by the fascia lata; the internal or pubic side is flat and on a plane posterior to the iliac; it is formed by the pectinseus and adductor muscles, also covered by the fascia lata. The inguinal lymphatic glands are irregular in number and size; they are in ge- neral about twelve in number, and may be divided into a superficial and a deep set; the former are the more nu- merous, and may be arranged from their situation into the superior and inferior; the superior are small, four or five in number, lie parallel to Poupart’s ligament, some- above, others below it; the inferior are two or three in

4<16 true costal cartilages, and at its superior angle by half a notch, which joined to a similar notch in the first piece, formed the cavity for the second cartilage : the five lower notches approximate, and the last is frequently completed hy the xiphoid cartilage. This bone consists of a very spongy, cellular, and vascular tissue, covered on each sur- face by a compact layer. The Ribs are twelve on each side ; they extend in an arched manner from the vertebrae towards the sternum, to which the seven superior are attached by separate car- tilages ; these are the true or the sternal ribs ; the five inferior do not form complete circles, and are connected anteriorly to each other, and to the cartilage of the last true rib, and are named false ; the two last of these are sometimes called the floating ribs ; the length of the ribs gradually increase from the first to the eighth, and then diminishes to the last; the breadth gradually diminishes from the first to the twelfth, but in each rib it is greatest near the sternum ; the first is nearly horizontal, the suc- ceeding gradually incline doAvnwards, so as to be lower be- fore than behind ; the external surface of each is conve.x and smooth, and gives attachment to different muscles ; the internal is concave, and lined by the pleura; the up- per border is round and smooth, and gives attachment to the intercostal muscles ; the inferior is thin, and marked with a groove, which is deep posteriorly for the intercos- tal vessels ; this also gives attachment to the intercostal muscles. The posterior end of the rib presents a head, neck, and tuberosity; the head is round, and divided by a ridge into two articular surfaces, which are received into the depressions in the dorsal vertebrae ; an inter- vertebral ligament is attached to the middle ridge. The head is supported by the neck, which is narrow and round, and lies in front of the transverse process, to which it is connected posteriorly by the middle costo-transverse ligament. Beyond the neck is the tubercle, which looks backwards and downwards, and is divided into two por- tions ; the internal of these is smooth for articulation, with the transverse process of the inferior of the two vertebrm, to whose bodies the head of the rib is connected ; the outer portion is rough for the insertion of the external or pos-

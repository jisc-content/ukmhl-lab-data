451 lip, external to which and looking backwards is the oval oblique opening of the dental canal, called the mental hole, through which a vessel and nerve of the same name pass ; posteriorly the body of the bone is concave, and lined above by the mucous membrane, in the middle it presents in the line of the symphisis, a chain of emi- nences, to the superior of which the fraenum linguae ad- heres, to the middle the genio-hyo-glossi, and to the in- ferior the genio-hyoidaei muscles; above and on each side of these are depressions for the sublingual glands and at the lower border are two depressions for the di- gastric muscles. The sides of the maxilla have a direc- tion backwards and outwards, on their outer surface is an oblique line which passes backwards and upwards to the anterior edge of the coronoid process, it gives at- tachment before to the platysma and depressor anguli oris, and behind to the buccinator muscles; internally also is an oblique line, parallel to, but more prominent than the external, to this is attached the mylo-hyoid muscle anteriorly, and the superior constrictor of the pharynx posteriorly; beneath this line is a slight groove which contains the mylo hyoid nerve, and below this an oblong depression for the submaxillary gland ; the lower edge or base of the jaw is rounded, thick before, thin behind, and gi'ooved opposite the second molar tooth for the facial artery; the upper or alveolar edge is broad posteriorly and bent a little inwards ; it has usually six- teen alveoli, which, as in the upper jaw, vary in form ac- cording to that of the teeth. The angle of the jaw is more or less obtuse, and often bent a little outwards; the masseter adheres to it externally, the internal ptery- goid internally, and the stylo-maxillary ligament to the ^rder of it. The ramus ascends a little backwards, is thick and round posteriorly and is enveloped by the pa- rotid gland, externally it is covered by the masseter, in- ternally it presents a deep groove which leads to a large hole, the inferior dental or maxillary ; this is situated near the centre of the ramus, and is protected inter- nally by a prominent spine into which the internal late- ral ligament is inserted, a slight groove leads from this hole to the mylo-hyoid muscle ; the dental hole leads into a canal which traverses the side of the bone beneath

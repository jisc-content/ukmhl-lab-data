182 tnaximus overhangs this ligament; the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium can be felt through the integu- ments, also (unless the subject be very fat) the ramus of the pubis leading obliquely upwards on each side to the symphysis: the integuments of the perinaeum and scrotum are generally of a dark brownish colour in the adult, and of a reddish hue in the child; very thin around the anus, and covering the scrotum, but dense in the intermediate space; along the mesial line, a pro- minent hard ridge is observable, the raphe of the peri- naeum ; this line commences in front of the anus, and extends along the perinaeum, scrotum and penis, as far as the prepuce of the latter. Dissect off the integu- ments from this region, and we expose posteriorly a cutaneous muscle (the sphincter ani) surrounding the anus, and anteriorly a strong fascia covering the mus- cles of the perinaeum, the crura penis, and the corpus spongiosum urethrae. Sphincter Ani is flat, thin, oval, pale, and open in the middle; it arises from a ligamentous substance, which extends from the os coccygis to the rectum; the fibres descend obliquely forwards, expanding on either side nearly as far outwards as the tuberosity of the is- chium ; at the posterior part of the anus this muscle divides into two fasciculi, which pass, one at each side of this opening, and unite at its anterior part, thus en- circling this orifice ; inserted into the raphe in the inte- guments, and into the superficial fascia; a fasciculus of it also perforates the latter, and is inserted into the common central point of the perinaeum; a point which will be more fully seen when the fascia shall have been raised: Use; to close the anus; it may also draw downward the bulb of the urethra; this muscle is almost constantly in a state of contraction, and, like all the sphincter muscles, belongs to the class of mixed mus- cles. One of its surfaces looks upwards, the other downwards; one edge is internal, the other external. It is superficial; its lateral extent is much greater in some subjects than in others; a few of its external fibres are divided in the first incision in the lateral operation of lithotomy;â€”beneath and internal to this muscle we may expose the following, witli very little dissection.

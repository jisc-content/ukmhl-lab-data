363 The Ophthalmic Artery arises close to the anterior clinoid process, passes forwards through the optic fora- men, below the optic nerve and external to it; in the orbit it rises above this nerve and twines round it to the inner side of this cavity, along which it passes to the inner canthus, where it terminates ; while on the outer side of the optic nerve it sends off, 1st, centralis re- tince, very small, pierces the sheath of the optic nerve, passes along the centre of the latter, into the eye, w’here it divides into delicate ramifications ; these spread along the internal layer of the retina, and one or two pierce the vitreous humour, and extend to the capsule of the lens; 2nd, the lachrymal passes along the external rec- tus muscle, and supplies the lachrymal gland, and the external part of the palpebrae; while above the optic nerve it gives off, 3rd, the supra-orbital, which passes forw'ards along the levator palpebrae, and throug’h the superciliary notch, supplies the muscles and integu- ments of the eye-brow, and ascending on the forehead, divides into several branches, which are distributed to the scalp, and communicate w’ith the temporal and occi- pital arteries; 4th, the posterior ciliary, ten or twelve in number, very small, surround the optic nerve, and pierce the back part of the sclerotic; pass between it and the choroid, and are distributed to the latter; some of their branches continue as far as the ciliary processes and the iris ; 5th, long ciliary, one on each side ; they pass horizontally forwards, between the sclerotic and choroid membranes, as far as the ciliaiy circle; here they divide, and form a circular inosculation round the circumference of the iris; from this several branches radiate inwards, and again unite in a circle near the pu- pil ; 6th, muscular arteries, to the different muscles in the orbit; 7th, ethmoidal, passes through the poste- rior orbital foramen to the mucous membrane in the ethmoid cells; 8th, superior and inferior palpebral, to the palpebrae, caruncula, conjunctiva, and lachrymal sac; 9th, nasal, passes beneath the trochlea, along the side of the nose, and inosculates with the labial artery; \Qt\i, frontal, ascends to the eye-brow and fore- head. n 2

350 SECTION III. DISSECTION OF THE GANGLIONS. In addition to the small ganglions already noticed in the description of the cerebral nerves, viz. the lenti- cular or ophthalmic, the spheno-palatine, or Meckel’s, and the sub-max,illary, also the several ganglions on the spinal nerves, we find one continued chain of these bodies placed anterior to the vertebral column on either side of the median line ; these ganglions, on each side, are all connected to each other, and resemble a knotted cord ; this cord receives the name of the sympathetic nerve. The Sympathetic Nerves, therefore, are two in number; they descend from the base of the cranium per- pendicularly along the neck, placed on the rectus capitis and longus colli muscles, and behind the great vessels and nen’es ; at the upper part of the chest each of these nerves is divided by the subclavian artery into several branches, which encircle that vessel and unite below it in the thorax ; through this cavity they descend at first ob- liquely backwards and outwards along the heads of the ribs and covered by the pleura; they then incline a little for- wards, and pass behind the true ligamentum arcuatum into the abdomen ; through this region they descend obliquely outwards on the fore-part of the lumbar vertebrae and be- tween the psoas and the crus of the diaphragm ; they then sink into the pelvis, keeping close to the sacrum, and descend along the anterior surface of this bone ob- liquely inwards; near its inferior extremity, or on the first part of the coccyx, these nerves unite and terminate in a small ganglion named ganglion impar. The supe- rior extremity of each sympathetic nerve is connected by several filaments to several of the cerebral nerves ; some of these connexions have been improperly termed the origin of the sympathetic ; in their course along the spi- nal column each nerve regularly communicates with every pair of the spinal nerves, with each of the cervical

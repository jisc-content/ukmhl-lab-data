The fosterior communicating artery arises from the carotid, opposite the ophthalmic; passes backwards and inwards, external to the corpora mamillaria, and joins the posterior cerebral artery ; this artery forms the late- ral part of the circle of Willis ; it sends several branches to the surrounding pia mater. The anterior cerebral artery, or arteria callosa, passes forwards and inw^ards above the optic nerve ; anas- tomoses with the opposite, by a short transverse branch, (the anterior communicating artery,) it then bends up- wards and backwards round the corpus callosum, on which it terminates by dividing into branches for the cor- responding hemisphere of the cerebrum. â€¢ The middle cerebral artery, very large, passes out- wards in the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into two tortuous branches, which supply the anterior and middle lobes of the cerebrum. (See page 296.) The subclavian arteries: the right arises from the arteria innominata, and proceeds nearly transversely outwards, between the sc^eni muscles, then obliquely dowmw'ards and outwards behind the clavicle; it is co- vered at first by the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, and thj^roid muscles; by the internal jugular vein, the vagus, and branches of the sjunpathetic nerve ; next, by the phre- nic nerr'^e and anterior scalenus muscle, and externally only by the skin, platysma, and fascia; it first passes over the recurrent nerve, the longus colli muscle, and sympathetic nerve; next, the pleura and middle scale- nus muscle, and lastly, the first rib. The left subcla- vian arises from the posterior part of the arch of the aorta, ascends nearly vertically out of the chest; then turns outwards and downwards between the scaleni mus- cles, and over the first rib; in the chest this artery lies very deep, and is covered by the pleura and the lung, also by the vena innominata, the vagus, the sternum, and the muscles attached to it; it lies near the vertebrae, along the side of the oesophagus and thoracic duct; in the rest of its course, its relations are similar to those of the right; each sends off the follorving branches,, verte- bral, thyroid axis, internal mammary, superior inter- costal and deep cervical.

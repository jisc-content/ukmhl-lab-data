107 muscle, which ends in four tendons; these descend, two anterior, for the middle and ring linger ; and two poste- rior, for the index and little finger; they all pass beneath the annular ligament, and proceed along the palm of the hand, superficial to the deep flexor tendons, and beneath the palmar fascia; and at the first phalanx of each fin- ger, or opposite the head of each metacai-pal bone, each of these tendons becomes enclosed in a strong sheath, with one of the deep flexors ; this sheath is continued to the anterior extremity of the second phalanx. Near the end of the first phalanx, each of the superficial flexor ten- dons is split for the passage of the tendon of the deep flex- or, which is continued on to the last, or ungual phalanx; while the divisions of each of the superficial tendons be- come everted or folded out, beneath the deep flexor, so as to lie nearer to the bone, and are inserted into the anterior part of the second phalanx. Use, to flex the second joint of each finger on the hand, the hand on the forearm, and the latter on the arm. The origin of this muscle is partly concealed by the three first de- scribed muscles, which arise from the internal condyle, and to which it is connected by the intermuscular septa; inferiorly a portion of it is superficial between the flexor carpi ulnaris and palmaris longus. The tendons of this muscle are enveloped in a large bursa behind the annular ligament: this carpal bursa is connected anteriorly to the annular ligament, posteriorly to the carpus, is expanded around the superficial and deep flexor tendons, the me- dian nerve, and the tendon of the flejtor^pollicis longus, and ends above and below in a cul de sac, each end of which extends beyond the edg?^ pf the annular ligament. In the palm of the hand the tendons of the flexor subli- mis are covered by the integuments, palmar fascia, and the superficial palmar arch of vessels and nerves ; along the fingers each tendon is enclosed in a strong fibrous sheath, which is continued to the end of the second phalanx of each finger; this sheath, together with the anterior surface of the phalanges, forms a complete ca- nal, or tube, which, half fibrous and half osseous, is lined by a synovial membrane, which forms a cul de sac at either extremity; being reflected over the tendons it en- closes, and forming several folds or frmna to connect

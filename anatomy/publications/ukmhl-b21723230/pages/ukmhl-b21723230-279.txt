261 the first phalanx of the fourth toe. Use, to separate the fourth toe from the three internal. All the interossei muscles serve to strengthen the meta- tarsus, to press the metatarsal bones together ; they also serve to flex the first joint of the four outer toes, and may assist in extending their last phalanges ; these muscles can exert no influence on the great toe ; there is only one muscle between the two first metatarsal bones : between the others there are two, therefore there are four supe- rior or dorsal interossei muscles, but three inferior ; the latter are situated more in the concavity of each meta- tarsal bone than between these bones ; the superior are stronger and more tendinous than the inferior, and are only partially covered by the long and short extensor tendons. In dissecting the muscles on the back of the leg, and those in the sole of the foot, we meet the posterior tibial artery and nenâ€™e, and their principal branches. The posterior tibial artery is the larger branch of the popli- teal ; it descends obliquely inw'ards beneath the deep fas- cia and the superficial muscles, and over the tibialis pos- ticus and flexor communis to the fossa betw'een the heel and inner ankle, it here ends in the two plantar arteries; in this course it gives off many muscular branches, also the peronceal artery ; the latter arises from the tibial, about an inch below' the poplitaeus ; it descends obliquely outwards along the back part of the fibula beneath the flexor pollicis longus; behind and a little above the outer ankle, it divides into the anterior and posterior peronseal arteries ; the former perforates the interosseous space and joins the external malleolar arteiy; the latter de- scends between the external ankle and the heel, and is distributed to the ligaments and adipose substance in that region. The two plantar branches of the posterior tibial artery are distributed to the muscles and integuments of the foot and toes ; the internal plantar is the smaller of the two, it supplies the muscles along the inner side of the tarsus ; the external plantar, the larger branch, runs across the foot obliquely outwards, towards the fifth me- tatarsal bone, between the first and second layers of plan- tar muscles; from the little toe it next runs obliquely

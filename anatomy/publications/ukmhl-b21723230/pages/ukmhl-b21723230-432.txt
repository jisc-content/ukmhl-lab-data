414 are the most used, the points of the spine to which these are attached will be drawn towards that side ; in the se- veral violent exertions also, such as pulling forcibly, the body is usually bent to the left side. The column is co- vered anteriorly by the anterior common ligament, and in the neck by the recti and longi muscles, in the back by the vena azygos and aorta, and in the loins by the crura of the diaphragm, the aorta, vena cava, and sympathetic neiwes ; posteriorly the column presents in the median line, the spinous processes short, horizontal, and separate in the cervical and lumbar, but close and bent over one another in the dorsal region ; on each side of these are the vertebral grooves, which are wide in the neck, but deep and narrow in the back and loins ; these are filled by the extensor muscles : the apertures between the la- minae are closed by the yellow ligaments, and covered by these muscles; outside these grooves in the nieck and loins lie the oblique or articular processes, but in the back the transverse processes, which in this region are on a plane posterior to those in the neck and loins : the inteiv^erte- bral oi; the holes of conjunction in the dorsal and lumbar regions are before the transverse processes, but in the neck between them ; in the back they are behind the ca- vities for the heads of the ribs. The spine supports the head and chest, and combines strength with lightness and flexibility ; it serves as the centre of all the motions of the trunk, and transmits the weight it bears to the sacrum and pelvi? ; it gives insertion to numerous muscles, and lodges and protects the medulla spinalis in the spinal ca- nal ; this canal is large and triangular in the neck and loins, round and contracted in the back. The spinal column is nearly straight or perpendicular in the child ; in the foetus the pyramidal figure is reversed, the base being in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, the apex in the lumbar and sacral. THE THOUAX OR CHEST Is formed by the twelve dorsal vertebrae, already de scribed, by the sternum and twelve pair of ribs.

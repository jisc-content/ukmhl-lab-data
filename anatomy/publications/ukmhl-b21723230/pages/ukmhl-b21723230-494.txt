4-76 the trapezoid, and internally the unciform ; both ante- riorly and posteriorly it gives attachment to the liga- ments. The unciform bone is next in size to the os magnum; it is situated at the lower and inner part of the carpus, is rather wedge-shaped, the base below, articulated with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones ; its upper surface is narrow, and meets the sernilunar bone ; its external side joins the magnum, its internal the cuneiform ; its posterior surface is rough for ligaments ; from its ante- rior projects a small hooked process, cun'ed outwards for the attachment of the annular ligament and some of the muscles of the little finger. All the bones of the carpus, like those of the tarsus, are composed of a loose, spongy vascular tissue, invested by a thin compact lamina; they are developed each from a single point of ossification, ex- cept the unciform, which has two ; the pisiform is the latest to ossify. The metacarpal bones belong to the class of long bones ; they are five in number, are placed nearly parallel to each other, except the first, which is on a plane ante- rior to the others ; the first is thick and short, the third is the longest. They are all concave on the palmar sur- face, convex on the dorsal, and large at each extremity; the posterior end is of an irregular figure ; the anterior presents a round head ; the palmar surface of each is narrow, and presents a median prominent line ; the pos- terior surface of the first is convex, but on the second, third and fourth, it presents a prominent longitudinal line, which bifurcates and forms the sides of a flat triangular surface, extending for near two-thirds of their length; into their edges the interossaei muscles are inserted ; the dorsal surface of the fifth is divided by an oblique line diagonally, the outer portion is concave, and lodges the fourth interosseous muscle, the inner convex and broad, and covered by the extensor tendon of the little finger. The carpal end or base of the first is concave from be- fore backwards, and convex transversely, to articulate with the trapezium ; the base of the second is concave, and articulates with the trapezoides, and presents exter- nally a small smooth surface for the trapezium, and inter- nally two smooth surfaces, one for the magnum, the other

150 surface or cavity for the stomach to move or to distend into posteriorly during the process of digestion. The splenic omentum extends from the fissure in the spleen to the great end of the stomach, and is continu- ous inferiorly with the great omentum ; the splenic ves- sels and the vasa brevia are contained between the laminae of this process. The colic omentum is a fold of peritonaeum which de- scends from the upper part of the right or ascending colon ; it generally lies posterior to the great omentum ; it is com- posed of two laminae, between which are contained blood- vessels and adipose substance. The appendices epiploiccE are attached all along the large intestine ; but principally to the transverse arch of the colon ; they are small prolongations of the peritonaeum, filled with a soft fatty substance ; they are never found attached to the small intestine ; they vaiy very much in different subjects in number and size ; their use is not ascertained. The mesentery is the largest and most remarkable pro- cess of the peritonaeum; it is continuous with the descend- ing layer of the meso-colon, and extends from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra obliquely downwards to the right iliac fossa ; this is the root of the mesentery; from this it expands very much, and is folded round the jejunum and ileum intestines, and then returns again to the spine or to the inferior surface of the root; the la- minae of the mesentery can be easily separated ; between them we find the mesenteric arteries, veins and nerves, also numerous absorbent vessels and glands ; the mesen- tery serves to support the convolutions of the small in- testines and the numerous vessels passing to and from these. The meso-ccBCum is a fold of peritonaeum which at- taches the caecum to the right iliac fossa; this process, however, is frequently imperfect: the posterior portion of this intestine being sometimes deprived of a serous coat, and connected to the iliac muscle by cellular membrane. The meso-rectum is a short fold of periwnasum which connects the superior portion of the rectum to the upper and anterior part of the sacrum; it encloses the haemor- rhoidal vessels and nen^es.

8G splenius colli and levator scapulae. Use, to extend the neck, and incline or turn it to one side ; it may also as- sist in inspiration by elevating the ribs. Tkansversalis Colli, appears as a prolongation of the longissimus dorsi, internal to which it arises by small tendinous and fleshy slips from the transverse processes of five or six superior dorsal vertebrae; the fibres uniting ascend obliquely outwards and forwards, and are inserted by small tendons into the transverse processes of three or four inferior cervical vertebrae between the cervicalis descendens and the trachelo- mastoideus ; its use is nearly similar to that of the last described muscle. Trachelo Mastoideus lies internal to the last, and external to the complexus ; it arises by several ten- dinous bands from the transverse processes of three or four superior dorsal vertebrae, and from as many inferior cervical; ascending a little outward it is inserted into the inner and back part of the mastoid process beneath the insertion of the splenius. Use, to assist in extend- ing the neck, to bring the head backwards, and to in- cline and rotate it to one side. Complexus arises from the transverse and oblique processes of three or four inferior cervical, and five or six superior dorsal vertebrae, internal to the transver- salis and trachelo-mastoideus; it forms a very thick muscle intersected by many tendinous bands ; it ascends a little inwards, and is inserted close to its fellow into the occipital bone, between the two transverse ridges. Use, to draw back the head, to fix and support it on the spine, also to rotate it, being, in this action, an anta- gonist to the splenius, and an auxiliary to the sterno- mastoid of its own side. The complexus is concealed by the trapezius and splenius; its insertion, which is co- vered by the former only, can be felt and seen through the integuments; it lies on the semi-spinalis colli, the deep cervical artery, and the small oblique and recti muscles. Detach the complexus from the spine and reflect it towards the occiput, and evert towards the ribs the other muscles of this layer, we shall thus ex- pose the fourth, layer of the dorsal muscles, which con- sists of the spinalis or semi-spinalis colli, the serai-spinalis

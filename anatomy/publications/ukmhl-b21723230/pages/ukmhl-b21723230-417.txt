399 HUMERO-CCBITAL ARTICULATION, OR THE ELBOW- JOINT. The opposed extremities of the humerus, ulna, and radius, mutually receive each other, and are attached together by an external and internal lateral, and by an anterior and posterior ligament. The external lateral ligament arises from the ex- ternal condyle, and is inserted into the annular li- gament of the radius; this ligament is confounded with the tendons of the supinator and extensor mus- cles. The internal lateral arises from the inner condyle, and is inserted in a radiated manner into the inner edge of the coronoid and olecranon processes, it is longer and broader than the external, is somewhat triangular, and divides inferiorly into two fasciculi, the anterior of which extends to the coronoid process, and is confounded with the common tendinous origin of the muscles of the fore- arm ; the posterior is inserted into the olecranon process, is covered by the ulnar nerve mid connected to the adja- cent muscles ; both portions adhere to the synovial mem- brane. The anterior ligament consists of thin fibres which take an irregular direction over the fore-part of the joint; they arise chiefly from above the internal condyle, and the depression on the fore-part of the humerus ; they thence spread over the synovial membrane, behind the brachiaeus anticus; some are inserted into the annu- lar ligament of the radius, and the remainder are gra- dually lost on the synovial membrane. The posterior ligament is not so distinct as the ante- rior, unless the fore-arm be flexed ; the fibres chiefly extend in a transverse direction from one condyle'lo the other, they are attached to the synovial membrane, and covered by the triceps and anconaeus. The synovial membrane is common to the humero- cubital as well as to the cubito-radial articulation; this membrane descends behind the anterior ligament, and a quantity of reddish fatty matter which intervenes, to the neck of the radius and annular ligament; round

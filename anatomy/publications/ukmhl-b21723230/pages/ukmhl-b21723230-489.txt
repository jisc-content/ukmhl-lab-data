471 external lateral ligament, and to the supinator and ex- tensor muscles ; between these condyles is an articulat- ing surface turned forwards and presenting externally a small round head which articulates with the radius, above and internal to wâ€™hich is a slight depression corres- ponding to the margin of the radius, internal to this is a sharp semicircular ridge which separates the radius and ulna, and next to this is the trochlea for articulation with the ulna, this is so much below the level of the small head and of the outer portion of the articular surface, as to give the whole bone an oblique direction outw'ards when its lower end is placed on a horizontal plane; at the anterior extremity of this trochlea is a small depres- sion for the reception of the coronoid process in flexion of the joint, and at the posterior is a' large fossa which lodges the olecranon process in the extended state of the forearm. The humerus, like the femur, is compact in the structure of its body, and cellular in that of its ex- tremities, it contains a large medullary canal, and is developed from eight points of ossification, one for the head, one for each tuberosity, one for the shaft, one for the trochlea, one for the small head, and one for each condyle. The Ulna is situated at the inner side of the forearm, it is longer than the radius, and is divided into the body and two extremities ; the upper extremity is larger than the lower, and presents two processes and an intervening cavity ; the posterior process, or the olecranon, is the highest part of the bone, its superior border gives at- tachment to the triceps extensor, posteriorly it presents a smooth triangular surface, covered by skin and by a bursa ; anteriorly it is concave, and covered with carti- lage ; the coronoid process is anterior and inferior to the preceding ; anteriorly it gives insertion to the brachialis anticus muscle, internally to the fle.xors and pronators, and to the internal lateral ligament ; and externally it is hollowed out into the lesser sigmoid cavity, which re- ceives the head of the radius; this cavity is o\'al, its greatest diameter being from before backwards, it leads superiorly into the great sigmoid cavity, which moves on the trochlea of the humerus in flexion and extension

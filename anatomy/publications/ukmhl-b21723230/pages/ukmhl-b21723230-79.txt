G1 injured. This region in geneni inclines a little to the left side below, in consequence of the left pleura being" more attached to the pericardium, which lies rather to the left of the middle line, whereas the right pleura is connected to the sternum in a vertical line ; the anteri- or mediastinum is wider superiorly and inferiorly than in the centre, hence some compare it to the letter X, and describe it as consisting of two triangular spaces, their apices joined in the centre, the base of one towards the neck, and that of the other towards the diaphragnu; the superior portion contains the origins of the sterno- hyoid and thyroid muscles and the remains of the thy- mus gland ; inferiorly there is much loose cellular mem- brane, which leads from the neck to the abdominal mus- cles, also lymphatic glands, and close to the sternum are the mammary vessels, and the triangulares sterni mus- cles. Next examine the organs on each side of the thora.x ; these are the lungs and their investing mem- brane the pleura; in almost all respects these organs are similar on the right and left side, and therefore either may be selected for examination; for this purpose lay open one side, suppose the right, of the thorax, by sawing through the ribs about their centre, and remov- ing their anterior portion; the first rib may be left un- injured ; thus the cavity of the right pleura will be opened, its glistening surface seen, with the lung lying- collapsed. The 'pleurae are serous membranes, their internal surface is smooth, polished, and free ; their ex- ternal surface is connected by fine cellular membrane to the parietes of the thorax and to the tissue of the lungs, over which they are reflected. That portion of each which invests the lungs is called pleura pulmonalis, and that which is connected to the parietes pleura pa- rietalis or costalis; the latter portion of the membrane is much more dense and strong than the former; each pleura is a shut sac, and contains only the serous va- pour it exhales; for although the lung appears within the cavity, it is yet really external to it or behind it; internally each pleura presents one continuous surface, which can be traced throughout its whole extent; thus we can perceive that the right pleura passes from the back of the sternum to form the side of the anterior

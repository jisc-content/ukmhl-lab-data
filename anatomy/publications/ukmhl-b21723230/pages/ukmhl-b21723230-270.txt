252 each other as those of the gastrocnemius; the external is longer and larger than the internal, and arises from the back part of the head and from the superior third of the fibula, behind the peronseus longus: the inter- nal head arises from the middle third of the tibia com- mencing below the oblique insertion of the poplitaeus; the two heads are connected by a strong tendinous arch, beneath which pass the posterior tibial nerve and vessels; all the fibres descend and form a large oval belly, which continues fleshy lower than the gas- trocnemius ; a tendon is formed first on its superficial surface, which is gradually united to that of the gas- trocnemius to form the tendo Achillis; this strong ten- don is broad and thin above, narrow in the middle, and round and thick below, it is composed of strong vertical fibres which descend behind the os calcis, over a bursa covering a cartilaginous impresssion on that bone, and it is inserted into a rough surface below that. UsCy to assist the gastrocnemius in extending the ankle; this muscle is almost entirely concealed by the gastrocne- mius ; a little below the middle of the leg, however, it projects on each side of the tendon of the latter, and forms the lower calf of the leg; it covers the deep seated muscles, vessels, and nerves. Detach the solaeus from its origin, and the strong deep fascia of the leg is exposed; this fascia is partly derived from the semi-membranosus and poplitaeus, and partly from the more superficial fascia of the leg; it ad- heres to the tibia and fibula, to the solaeus and to the deep muscles; inferiorly this fascia is strong, and is connected to the sheaths of the tendons that pass behind the malleoli, and to the internal annular ligament of the ankle; dissect off tlais fascia and clean the four following muscles. PoPLiT.cus, situated obliquely at the upper and back part of the leg, behind the knee, and above the other muscles in this region, flat and triangular, arises by a round tendon from a depression on the outer condyle, descends obliquely inwards and backwards, above the head of the fibula, and along the external semilunar cartilage, to which it is connected by the synovial membrane of the knee, and by a few tendi-

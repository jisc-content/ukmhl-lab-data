73 of these valves is to prevent the blood returning from the artery into the ventricle ; for, as the former becomes distended, the blood flows behind these valves, separates them from the sides of the arterj', and so approximates them to each other; and when the artery contracts, it presses the ’Qood so strongly against these valves as nearly to intercept the opening, and cause the blood to flow onwards through the artery ; the corpora arantii are supposed to be of use in giving additional strength towards the centre of the opening, where the pressure will be greatest; the semilunar valves, both in the pul- monary artery and in the aorta, while they support the column of blood in these vessels cannot wholly prevent its regurgitation to the heart. The pulmonary artery ascends obliquely backwards for about two inches and a half within the pericardium; and just as it escapes from this ca%dty it divides into the right and left branch ; in this course it lies at first anterior to the aorta, and after- wards to the left side. The right pulmonary artery is the longer branch ; it turns in a transverse direction to the right side, and passes through the arch of the aorta, and behind the ‘superior cava, to the root of the right lung, and there divides into three branches. ■ The left pulmonary artery is short, proceeds to the left side, and entering the root' of the left lung anterior to the left bronchus, divides into two branches j from the division of the pulmonary artery a ligamentous cord extend.^ backwards and downwards to the lower extremity of the arch of the aorta; this is the remains of the ductus arte- riosuSy which in the foetus conveyed the blood from the I pulmonary artery into the aorta, as it could not pass in I any quantity through the condensed structure of the I lungs ; the recurrent, or inferior laryngeal nerve of the I left side winds round this substance. In the lungs the pulmonary arteries divide into numerous branches, which spread minutely on the air-cells, on which they termi- nate in the pulmonary veins, which vessels thus arise by innumerable ramifications : these unite with each other, and form larger trunks, which arrive at the root of the lungs, two on each side, where they lie anterior and in- ; ferior to the pulmonary artery; these veins then pass inwards to join the left auricle, a cavity which may bo £

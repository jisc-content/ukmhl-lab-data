120 is a notch for the last of the sacral nerves; these cor- nua are sometimes joined to the base of the coccyx; at either side of the median spine are the four posterior holes, smaller and more irregularly formed than the an- terior ; they transmit the posterior sacral nen^es ; exter- nal to these are a range of tubercles analogous to the oblique processes; the sides or iliac surfaces are uneven, triangular, broad above, and consisting of two portions, one superior, broad, and irregular, covered with cartilage for articulation with the ilium ; the other inferior, thin, and attached to the sacro-sciatic ligaments. The sa- crum, though very thick, is yet light and spongy, and covered by a thin lamina of compact substance; it is long and narrow in the male, broad and short and more cuiwed in the female; in the latter it is about four inches and a half long, its breadth above is nearly the same, but below only half an inch; in the foetus it is nearly straight, and consists of five pieces, in each of which ossification commences in several points. Tlie Coccyx, placed at the extremity of the sacrum, is formed of three or four pieces, which in the old are united into one or two, but in the young are always distinct; in the adult it is triangular, and prolongs the curve of the sacrum anteriorly, the base is above, with a smooth oval surface adapted to the sacrum, and on either side of this is a small horn or process which is also connected to the sacrum by bone or ligament; be- neath this is a notch for the last sacral nerve ; the apex is irregularly tubercular, and gives attachment to the muscles of the rectum ; the anterior or pelvic surface is smooth, supports the rectum, and is marked by two or three transverse lines, which indicate its original divi- sion into distinct pieces ; the posterior or spinal surface is rough for the attachment of muscles; it is soft and spongy, its ossification commences by four or five points, it becomes united to the sacrum earlier in the male than in the female. OSSA INNOMINATA. As each os innominatum is divisible in early life into three bones, the ilium, ischium, and pubis, it will bo

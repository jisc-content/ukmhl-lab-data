17 middle artery of the dura mater, the inferior deiital, several muscular branches to the temporal, masseter^ pterygoid, and buccinator muscles, and terminates by dividing into the nasal, descending palatine, and infra- orbital arteries. Veins accompany these different ar- teries, and in the parotid gland we find the temporal and intermaxillary veins forming, by their junction, a considerable vessel called the external jugular vein, which will be afterw'ards seen descending superficially in the neck. (For the particular description of the blood-vessels of the face, see the Anatomy of the Vas- cular System.) The nerves which are met with in the dissection of the face are branches of the 7th and 5th pair; those of the 7th, or theportio dura, have in general a transverse direction from behind forwards, are remarkable for their ple.xiform arrangement, and have numerous com- munications with the three branches of the 5th, which are distributed chiefly in a vertical direction along the anterior part of the face. The portio dura escapes from the temporal bone through the stylo-mastoid hole, turns forwards into the parotid gland, in which it divides into two large branches, which subdivide and join again by several filaments forming the plexus, named pes anse- rinus, or parotidcean plexus, from which several netwes proceed; some ascend obliquely forwards to the temple and forehead, others pass transversely to the muscles of the face, and several descend, some parallel, and others inferior, to the side of the lower maxilla. The 5th pair of nerves consists of three portions, viz. the ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxil- lary ; a branch of each of these divisions is met with in the dissection of the face. The frontal nerve, which is a branch of the ophthalmic, or first division of the 5th, is seen escaping from the orbit by the superciliary notch or foramen ; it then ascends on the forehead, dis- tributes its branches to the integuments and muscles, and communicates with the portio dura. The infra- orbital nerve, which is a branch of the superior maxil- lary, or second division of the 5th, is observed passing out of the infra-orbital foramen, behind the levator labii supcrioris alaeque nasi, and dividing into several

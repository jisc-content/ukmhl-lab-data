302 the frontal sinus. The external branch, or the supra- orbital or proper frontal nerve appears as the continua- tion of the original trunk, both in size and in direction, it passes through the superciliary notch or foramen, as- cends on the forehead, divides into two branches which subdivide into numerous filaments; these chiefly ascend in the muscles and integuments of the scalp, many of them take a very long course, and communicate with the portio dura, with the occipital nerves, and with those from the opposite side. Neither of these two nerves gives any filaments to the muscles in the orbit. The 7iasal nerve separates from the frontal behind the orbit, enters this cavity beneath that branch, and betw'een the two heads of the external rectus, it then runs obliquely forwards and inwards above the optic nerve and below the superior rectus muscle, and con- tinues its course along the inner side of the orbit below the supei’ior oblique muscle, and here divides into two branches, the external or the infra-trochleator nen’e, and the internal or the nasal; the nasal nerve, pre- vious to its entrance into the orbit, is joined by a fila- ment from the sympathetic nerve; on the outer side of the optic, and just as it enters this cavity, it gives off a delicate branch about an inch in length, which runs along the outer side of the optic ners'e to the lenticular ganglion; as the nasal nerve passes over the optic it gives off two ciliary nerv'es. The infra-trochleator nerve runs forwards beneath the pulley of the oblique muscle and divides into several filaments which communicate with the supra trochleator nerve, and are distributed to the lachrymal passages, and to the integuments and muscles on the side and dorsum of the nose. The in- ternal branch or the proper nasal passes through the anterior of the internal orbital holes into the cranium, crosses the cribriform plate, and descends by the side of the crista galli into the nasal fossae where it divides into posterior and anterior filaments; the former are dis- tributed to the septum, the latter descend behind the nasal bones, and are lost in the integuments at the tip of the nose. The sixth pair of nerves should be next dis- sected, as it is distributed along with the preceding nerves in the orbit.

257 Abductok, Minimi Digiti, is situated along the outer edge of the foot, arises tendinous and fleshy from the outer side of the os calcis, and from a strong liga- ment which extends from this to the fifth metatarsal bone, also from the base of the latter, from the plantar fascia and its external intermuscular septum ; inserted tendinous into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe, and into the adjoining surface of the metatarsal bone. Use, to separate the little toe from the others, and to flex it; this muscle is also su- perficial, the fascia covering it is very strong, it is the most external of the muscles in this region. Detach this first layer of muscles from their posterior attach- ments, and throw them forwards towards the toes ; the tendons of the flexor pollicis and communis are now ex- posed, also the accessory muscle and the lumbricales; all these constitute the second layer of the plantar mus- cles. The tendon of the flexor longus digitorum communis is seen passing from tire inner side of the os calcis to the middle of the plantar region, where it divides into its four tendons, which have been already described as entering the sheaths on the inferior surface of the four outer toes, passing through the slits in the tendons of the flexor bre- vis, and then inserted into the last phalanx of each toe. The tendon of the flexor pollicis longus is now also seen passing above the former, to w'hich it is united by a ten- dinous fasciculus, and then proceeding forwards to the great toe. Musculus Accessorius, or flexor digitorum acces- sorius, arises fleshy and tendinous from the inferior and internal part of the os calcis, forms a flat and somewhat square fleshy belly, w^hich proceeding forwards, is in- serted into the upper and outer part of the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus, just before it divides. Use, to assist the long flexor, and to counteract its obliquity ; this muscle lies above the flexor digitorum brevis. Lumbricales are four small muscles which arise tendinous and fleshy from the tendons of the flexor digitorum longus ; there is none for the great toe ; the first or the internal one is the largest; these four muscles

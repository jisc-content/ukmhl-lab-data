415 The Sternum is situated at the forepart of the chest, in the median line, and in a direction from above down- wards and forwards ; of a flat and elongated form, broad above, narrow in the middle, and pointed below ; its an- terior surface is covered by the skin and pectoral aponeu- rosis, is marked by four transverse lines which indicate its original division into five pieces ; the two upper lines are most prominent; the posterior surface is smooth and concave, gives attachment to muscles, and looks toward the anterior mediastinum ; the edges are thick, and pre- sent seven depressions for the cartilages of the true ribs ; the superior of these is round, and the margin of it is often continuous with the first costal cartilage ; the re- maining depressions are angular, and most of them cor- respond to the transverse lines or ridges ; hence these sockets are more distinct in the young than in the old ; they are all covered with cartilage and separated from each other by notches. The upper or clavicular end of the sternum is broad, thick, and concave from side to side, for the lodgment of the inter-clavicular ligament, and is hollowed out at each angle for articulation with the cla- vicle, into a shallow sigmoid cavity covered with cartilage and directed outwards and backwards; this surface is slightly convex from before backwards ; the inferior tex- tremity is long and thin, and ends in a cartilaginous epi- physis, the xiphoid or ensiform cartilage ; this is some- times pointed, sometimes bifid, thick or thin, turned for- wards or backwards, and sometimes perforated by a central hole; it remains cartilaginous to a late period of life ; to it the abdominal muscles and the costo-xiphoid ligament are attached. The sternum in the foetus is separable into four or five pieces, in the adult into two. The upper piece is the larger and thicker of the two, and somewhat square, its edges receive the cartilages of the first rib, and half of those of the second ; its lower edge is nearly straight, and iroited to the second piece by a cartilage w4ich some- times admits of slight motion between the two, but which in old persons is generally found ossified : a foramen is sometimes observed in this piece of the sternum. The second piece is longer and narrower than the first, its edges are marked by five depressions for the five lower

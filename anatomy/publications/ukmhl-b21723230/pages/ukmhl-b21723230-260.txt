242 towards the outer ankle, behind which it passes to the external and superior part of the foot, where it is dis- tributed •, this nerve is by some called “ coramunicans tibialis.” The popliteal artery descends obliquely out- wards through this space, and at the lower edge of the poplitaeus muscle divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries ; in this course it sends off many muscu- lar and five articular branches, the latter supply the ends of the bones, and the synovial membrane of the knee joint. The popliteal vein accompanies the artery, lying superficial and somewhat external to it; it re- ceives branches which correspond to those of the ar- tery ; and it is joined inferiorly by the lesser or posterior saphena vein. Next proceed to the dissection of the leg SECTION III. DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Remove the integuments of the leg and foot; on the plantar surface of the latter they are always remarkably hard and thick, even in the foetus, particularly beneath the heel and the first and last joints of the toes; in these situations also the subcutaneous fat has a pecu- liar granulated structure, being intersected by tendi- nous bands, which pass from the skin to the plantar fascia. Beneath the integuments of the leg we find two cutaneous veins, the internal and external saphena; the internal saphena is large and regular, and has numerous branches ; it commences by small veins from the upper surface of the toes, and from the dorsum of the foot; these run tow'ards the inner malleolus and unite in one large vessel, which ascends along the inner side of the leg, receiving in its course numerous branches from the integuments; it then passes behind the inner condyle of the femur, and ascending along the inner and ante- rior part of the thigh, it terminates in the femoral vein about an inch and a half below Poupart’s ligament; on

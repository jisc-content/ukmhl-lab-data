486 thick curdy pus, and not unfrequently osseous matter; in cutting- into the lungs, a number of abscesses are found, from many of the tubercles having advanced into a state of suppuration, it has been remarked, that tuber- cles have been found in the upper portion of the right lung, where there has been an impossibility of detecting them in any other part. MOEBID APPEARANCES IN THE ABDOMEN. Peritoneum. This membrane lining the internal surface of the abdomen and investing the different viscera, although not so liable to inflammation as the pleura, yet it is not uncommonly inflamed ; when inflam- mation is present, it appears more pulpy than in the natural state, it is not so transparent, and is crowded with a number of small vessels, holding florid blood; where this membrane covers the intestinal canal, the inflammation appears to penetrate nearly as far as the mucous coat; sometimes the inflammation is confined to particular parts and at others it spreads over the whole membrane; when the inflammation is great the intes- tines become thick and massy, arising from the accu- mulation of fluids in the small vessels and extravasation of coagulable lymph between their tunics ; this appear- ance may be observed in the omentum, where fluids of this nature are thrown out between its different la- mina ; layers of coagulable lymph gluing different por- tions of the abdominal viscera together, a brownish fluid, which is serum and some pus, in which shreds of co- agulable lymph float, are common appearances; if the patient survive the attack of inflammation, this coagida- ble lymph becomes organized, and the adhesions which it forms become permanent, and are to be met with in many bodies after death; an inflammation resembling the above occurs frequently in women who have been re- cently delivered, it is called puerperal peritonitis, tbe uterus is found dilated, and it is so fatal in its progress, that it seldom advances to the formation of permanent adhesions. Peritoneal abscess occurs in the cellular substance connecting the peritoneum to the viscera, the most

so minal muscles, particularly to the transversalie, also to the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior; its internal surface is attached along the median line to the spines of the lumbar vertebrae, and on either side to the transverse processes. This fascia gives great support to the loins, where the skeleton is compara- tively weak; like the ligamentum nuchae it supports the trunk in flexion, it dso assists in maintaining it in equilibrio in lateral motion, and it also serves to give attachment to several muscles, which again in their turn sen'e to keep it in a state of tension.. The muscles of the back are many of them indistinct, and vary very much in different subjects both in their appearance and in their exact attachments to any cer- tain number of vertebrae; the student is not to expect therefore to find each muscle in this region to corres- pond accurately with the description that is given, some being attached to a greater, others to a lesser number of processes than is stated. The muscles of the back are arranged in four successive layers, each nearly covering the other betw'een the integuments and the bones ; the muscles of the first layer are the trapezius and the latis- simus dorsi. Trapezius, broad, triangular, tire base along the spine, the apex at the shoulder, arises by a thin apo- neurosis from the internal third of the superior trans- verse ridge of the occipital bone, from the ligamentum nuchae, and from the spinous processes of the last cer- vical, and of all the dorsal vertebrae; the superior fibres descend obliquely outwards and fonvards; the middle pass transversely, the inferior ascend obliquely forwards ; all converge towards the shoulder, and are mserted into the posterior border of the external third of the clavicle, and of the acromion process, also into the upper edge of the spine of the scapula. Use, to raise and draw backwards the shoulder; the inferior fibres which end in a triangular shaped tendon, which glides over the triangular smooth surface at the commencement of the spine, may draw down the base of the scapula, and thus by rotating this bone will elevate the acromion process, and assist the remainder of the muscle in raising the shoulder; the trapezius may also incline the head back-

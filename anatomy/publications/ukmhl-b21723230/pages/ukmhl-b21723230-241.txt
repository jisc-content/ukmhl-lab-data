223 the side of the patella, and by an aponeurosis which adheres to the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, into the head of the tibia. Use, to extend the knee, also to rotate the leg outwards ; this muscle is partly con- cealed by the rectus; its external surface is tendinous above and flashy below, its internal is fleshy above and tendinous below. Vastus Internus, smaller and shorter than the last, arises on the anterior part of the femur, from the inter-trochantaric line ; from the inner edge of the li- nea aspera, its whole length, also from the inner side of the femur, the fibres descend obliquely forwards, and are inserted into the inner edge of the tendon of the rectus, also into the patella, and by an aponeu- rosis, which cover's the inner side of the synovial mem- brane of the knee, into the head of the tibia. Use, to extend the knee and turn the leg a little inwards. The vastus internus is partly concealed by the rectus and sartorius, its origin lies anterior to the insertion of the psoas, pectineeus, and adductor muscles, and overlaps the cruraeus, so as to be in contact with the vastus ex- ternus; its internal surface is tendinous above and fleshy below; an aponeurosis from the two vasti covers the patella and its ligament, also the sides of the joint; this aponeurosis is inserted into the head of the tibia, it serves to support the patella in its situation, and to pro- tect the sides of the articulation like a capsular liga- ment ; a small bursa is situated over the patella, between this aponeuro.sis and the skin ; the insertion of the vastus externus into the patella overlaps that of the vastus in- ternus, and both overlap the cruraeus, from which the vastus externus can be more easily separated above, but the vastus internus below. Crur.eus, shorter than either of the vasti, between which it lies, larger and more tendinous below than above, arises fleshy from the anterior and external part of the femur, commencing at the inter-trochanteric line, and extending along three-fourths of the bone, as far outwards as the linea aspera; it does not adhere to the inner side of the femur, there being a portion of the latter, nearly an inch in breadth and extending almost the whole length of the bone, to which no mus-

and minimus muscles. 7th, The obturator artery passes out of the pelvis by the superior part of the thyroid hole into the upper part of the thigh beneath the pectinaeus, and divides into several branches to supply the obturator and adductor muscles. 8th, The sciatic artery passes over the pyriform muscle and escapes from the pelvis by the lower part of the sciatic notch, along wdth the sciatic nerve; it sends several branches to the glutaeus maximus, the hamstrings, and adductor magnus ; also to the small capsular muscles and to the sciatic nerve ; these commu- nicate with the circumflex and perforating arteries. 9th, The internal pudic artery, smaller than the preceding, leaves the pelvis along with it below the pyriform muscle, re-enters the cavity between the sciatic ligaments, and then ascends obliquely inwards and fonvards along the tuber and ramus of the ischium and ramus of the pubis, and a little below the symphysis pubis divides into two branches. In the pelvis the pudic at first gives small branches to the adjoining viscera ; as it is passing round the spine of the ischium, and between the sciatic liga- ments, it gives small branches to the surrounding liga- ments and muscles ; when it has re-entered the pelvis it gives off, 1st, external hcemorrlioidal arteries, two or three, they pass transversely to the side of the rectum and anus, and supply the integuments and muscles in that region ; 2nd, the perinceal artery first descends, then turns forwards and upwards round the transversus perinaei, proceeds along the perinaeum, and is distributed to the muscles and integuments in this situation, and to the scrotum ; 3rd, transversalis perincei, a small branch arising near to and often from the preceding ; it takes the course of the muscle of that name, and is lost in the muscles and integuments ; 4th, artery of the bulb, passes transversely between the layers of the triangular ligament, enters the spongy substance of the bulb, and spreads its branches through the corpus spongio- sum urethrae ; 5th and 6th, artery of the corpus caver- nosum and dorsalis penis ; the former enters and ex- tends along the corpus cavernosum, the latter along the dorsum of the penis as far as the glans. In the female the pudic artery gives off branches to the perinaeum and

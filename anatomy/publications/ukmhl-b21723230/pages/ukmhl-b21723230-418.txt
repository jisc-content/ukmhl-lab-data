400 which it forms a cul de sac, is prolonged into the sig- moid cavities of the ulna, and thence is reflected to the lateral ligaments and to the triceps tendon, which leads it to the posterior depression on the humerus, it is thence expanded over the articular eminences at the lower end of this bone. RADIO-ULIfAR ARTICULATIONS. These are two, a superior and an inferior; in the superior the head of the radius is received into the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and is retained in it by the following ligament. The annular ligament forms about three-fourths of a circle ; it arises from the ante- rior, and is inserted into the posterior border of the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna; this ligament is lined by the synovial membrane of the joint, it encircles the head and neck of the radius ; it often presents a cartila- ginous structure. The oblique ligament is a small round fibrous cord, it arises from the coronoid process of the ulna, de- scends obliquely outwards, and is inserted into the radius below its tubercle; it is on a plane anterior to the interosseous ligament, and it separates the flexor digitorum sublimis from the supinator radii brevis muscle. The opposed edges of the radius and ulna are con- nected by a thin aponeurosis the interosseal membrane or ligament; it is composed of long fibres which de- scend obliquely inwards from the radius to the ulna ; this ligament is deficient above and below, and in many places is perforated by vessels. In the inferior radio-ulnar articulation, the round head of the ulna is received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius, and retained in it by a loose synovial mem- brane or the sacciform ligament, which is covered be- fore and behind by some ligamentous fibres; it passes from the radius to the ulna, and forms a very loose sac alx)ve the following ligament or cartilage ; it always con- tains a quantity of synovia. The fibro-cartilage is triangular, it arises narrow from the styloid process of the ulna, and is inserted

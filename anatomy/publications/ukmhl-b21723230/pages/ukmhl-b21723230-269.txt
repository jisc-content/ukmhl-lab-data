251 body forwards on the toes as in progression; to flex the knee joint, also to secure the articulation against dis- placement, by preventing the condyles of the femur slipping backwards off those of the tibia. This large muscle is superficial, a small portion of its internal head is overlapped by the semi-membranosus ; its deep surface is more aponeurotic than its superficial; the lower angle of the popliteal space separates its two heads; in this angle the popliteal vessels, the posterior tibial nerve, and the plantaris muscle are contained; a bursa is placed between each head of this muscle and the condyle of the femur, which it covers; the exter- nal head conceals the tendon of the poplitseus; the internal covers the deep processes of the semi-membra- i:osus tendon and an intervening bursa, ^Iso the insertion of the poplitaeus; the gastrocnemius covers the greater part of the solseus, therefore, to examine the latter, de- tach the heads of the gastrocnemius from the condyles, and separate this muscle from the solaeus to within two or three inches of the heel; the plantaris muscle is now also exposed. Plantaris arises fleshy from the back part of the femur above the external condyle, and from the pos- terior ligament of the knee; it is connected to the external head of the gastrocnemius, and forms a small pyramidal fleshy belly, which descends obliquely in- wards, crosses the popliteal vessels, and ends in a flat tendon (the longest in the body) which descends be- tween the gastrocnemius and solaeus; and when the tendons of these muscles are about to unite, that of the plantaris becomes superficial, it then descends along the inner side of the tendo Achillis to the heel, and is inserted into the posterior part of the os calcis, a little anterior to the tendo Achillis; it has also some connexion to the plantar fascia. Use, to extend the foot, and turn it inwards, also to make tense the fascia, and to flex the knee; its origin is partly concealed by the external head of the gastrocnemius; its tendon also is at first covered by this muscle, but inferiorly it is superficial. This muscle is sometimes wanting. SoLiscs, of an oval flattened figure, consists supe- riorly of two heads, which are not so distinct from

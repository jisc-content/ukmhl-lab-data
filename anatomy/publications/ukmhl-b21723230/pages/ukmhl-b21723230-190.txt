172 surface of each is convex, the posterior is flat; in the young subject the surfaces are ver)' uneven, the kidneys at that age being lobulated. The external Irorder of each is smooth and convex, and directed outwards and backwards ; the concave edge is of much less extent, looks forwards and inwards, and contains the arteries, veins, and excretory duct; the veins are usually, but bj' no means constantly, anterior; the arteries, five or six in number, are behind these ; and the ureter is posterior and inferior to both. The superior extremity of each kidney is larger and nearer to the spine than the infe- rior. The kidney is partially covered by peritonaeum, to which it is but loosely connected ; it has also a cap- sule of cellular and adipose substance, and a strong smooth fibrous tunic, which adheres clo.sely to its sub- stance, preseiT^es its form, and is continued into its inte- rior, along the vessels, as far as the calyces of the kid- ney. Remove one kidney from the subject, and divide it by a perpendicular incision from the conve.x to the concave edge, the gland will then be found to consist of two distinct substances, the external or vascular, the in- ternal or membranous. The external, vascular, or cor- tical substance, forms a covering for the kidney about two lines thick, and sends longer prolongations into the body of the gland, between the tubular fasciculi. The cortical substance is of a dark brovui red colour, and can be separated into numerous small grains ; when in- jected it seems wholly composed of arteries and veins. Internal to this is the tubular substance, which consists of fine vessels of a pale colour, and very dense struc- ture ; these are arranged in conical fasciculi, about eight or ten in number ; the base of each is directed to- wards the circumference, the apex towards the concave edge of the kidney ; the apices of these cones are named 'papillcB; each papilla is perforated by several small holes, through which the urine may be observed to flow when the tubular cones are compressed. The papillte are surrounded by membranous sacs called calyces ; each calyx contains one or two papillae, and are five or six in number ; they are dense and white, com^wsed ex- ternally of the fibrous coat of the kidney, and internally

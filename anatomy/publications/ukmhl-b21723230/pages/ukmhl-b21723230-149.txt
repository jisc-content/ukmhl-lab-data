131 of the internal oblique, and the tendon of the tians- versalis. This sheath commences at the edge of the thorax, and terminates midway between the umbilicus and the pubis; below which, all the tendons pass ante- rior to this muscle. If this part of the rectus be divided, the deficiency in the back of the sheath will be obvious, as it generally terminates abruptly by a lunated edge ; in some cases, however, it ends gradually : the epigas- tric vessels ascend within this sheath, on the posterior surface of the muscle. The sheath of the rectus serves to confine this muscle in its proper place, and to pre- vent it, when contracted, from injuring the abdominal viscera immediately behind it; it also strengthens the parietes of the abdomen, and prevents the more fre- <iuent occurrence of hernia; the deficiency in the back part of the sheath below, may permit the abdominal muscles to exert more direct influence on the urinary bladder when distended. The rectus is intersected by three or four irregular, or zigzag, tendinous lines; one of these is always to be found opposite the umbilicus, a second midway between this and the xiphoid cartilage, opposite to which a third is always placed; if a fourth exist, it will be found below the umbilicus : these inter- sections are not complete : they are generally deficient on the back part of the muscle; the anterior part of the sheath adheres intimately to each of them ; some fleshy fibres 'pass over one line, and are inserted into those above and below; by means of these lines the rectus is enabled to act in distinct or separate portions, so as to compress different parts of the abdomen in succession : anterior to the origin of the rectus is the following small muscle : PvRAMiDALis, is somctimos abscnt; it urfses broad and fleshy from the pubis, ascends obliquely inwards, and is inserted narrow and tendinous into the linea alba, midway between the umbilicus and pubis. Use, it as- sists the rectus, and makes tense the linea alba; it is co- vered by the tendon of the external oblique, by the tri- anpmlar ligament and the conjoined tendons. Dissect off the transversalis muscle in a direction from the ilium towards the linea semilunaris, and the fascici transversalis will be exposed covering the peri-

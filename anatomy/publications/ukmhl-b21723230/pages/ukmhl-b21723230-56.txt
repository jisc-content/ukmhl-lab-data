38 SECTION IV. DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. To obtain a view of the muscles of the pharynx and palate, the student may now make the following’ dissec- tion : divide the trachea and oesophagus in the lower part of the neck; detach them from the %'ertebrae, to which they are loosely connected; draw forward these organs, together with the vessels and nerves on either side; place the saw flat on the bodies of the vertebrae; insinuate its edge between the styloid and mastoid processes on each side, and make a vertical section of the head ; we have thus the face and anterior part of the cranium separated from the vertebral column ; or, should it be desirable to preserve the cranium, we may separate the occipital bone from the atlas, and then re- move from the subject the whole head, together with the organs we wish to examine; distend the pharvTix with hair or tow, and remove some of the loose cellular tissue connected to it. The pharynx is a large, muscular, and membranous bag, extending from the base of the cranium to the 4th or 5th cervical vertebra, where it ends in the oesopha- gus; it is placed behind the nose, mouth and larynx; is somewhat of an oval form, the largest part being opposite the os hyoides, and the smaller extremity joining the oesophagus. The pharynx is attached supe- riorly and posteriorly to the cuneiform process, by an aponeurosis, which is very strong in the middle line, laterally by a thinner aponeurosis to the petrous bone, and anteriorly, by fleshy fibres to the internal ptery- goid plate and hamular process, and to the posterior part of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower maxilla;—the pharynx is connected posteriorly to the vertebras and to the deep muscles of the neck by loose reticular membrane; anteriorly it is attached by mucous mem- brane and muscular fibres to the cornua of the os hy- oides and thyroid cartilage, and to the sides of the cri- coid, behind which the pharynx abruptly contracts and ends in the oesophagus; on either side of the pharjmx and loosely connected to it, is the skeath of the carotid

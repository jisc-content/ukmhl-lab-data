939 branosus, the sciatic nerve, and the triceps muscles; it also conceals the short head ; inferiorly the biceps pass over the external articular vessels and the external head of the gastrocnemius muscle, and forms the outer hamstring. Semi-tendinosus, large, flat, and fleshy above, round and tendinous below, arises by fleshy fibres from the tuberosity of the ischium in common with the long head of the biceps, also from the tendon of the latter for about three inches ; it descends obliquely inwards, and about four inches above the knee it ends in a long- round tendon, which passing behind the head of the tibia, is then reflected forwards between the tendon of the semi-membranosus and the internal head of the gastrocnemius, and is inserted into the anterior angle of the tibia below its tubercle, inferior and posterior to the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius, to which it is connected : from the convex edge of the tendon an aponeurosis is given oflF, which joins the fascia of the leg. Use, to flex the knee and rotate the leg inwards, to extend the thigh, to support the pelvis, and prevent the trunk falling fonvards. This muscle is cohered superiorly by the glutaeus maximus ; the rest of its course is superficial, a transverse line usually intersect? ' it about its centre. Semi-membranosus, beneath the semi-tendinosus, flat and aponeurotic superiorly, thick and fleshy in the middle, round and tendinous below ; arises % a flat tendon from the upper and outer part of the tuber ischii ; this descends obliquely inwards, ends in a fleshy belly, which retains this muscular structure lower down than either of the former muscles; a little above the knee it ends in a round tendon, which passes behind the internal condyle, and divides into three processes, one of which passes outwards, another downwâ€™ards, and a third forwards ; the first is a broad aponeurosis, which ascends obliquely outwards, beneath the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle over the back part of the knee- joint, and is inserted into the external condyle of the femur ; this aponeurosis has been termed the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, or the ligament of Winsloiu ; the second is a strong and broad fascia, which descends

1-57 the left or descending', and the sigmoid flexure; there is, however, no mark of distinction whatever between these different divisions. The ascending colon e.xtends from the caecum to the inferior surface of the right lobe of the liver, which it marks with a superficial depression ; this portion of the colon is concave anteriorly, and covered by the perito- naeum and by the abdominal muscles; it lies on the right kidney: the duodenum is connected to it internally; the superior e.xtremity is generally tinged wdth bile from be- ing in contact with the gall bladder. The tra7isverse arch of the colon extends tortuously from the right hypochondrium, across the inferior part of the epigastric or the umbilical region into the left hypochondrium: it is covered by the abdominal mus- cles, and lies anterior to the small intestines : on the right side it is connected to the liver, in the middle to the stomach and to the great omentum; and its left extremity, which is superior and posterior to the right, is attached to the spleen by peritonaeum; the appendices epiploicae are very numerous on this part of the colon. The left or descending colon extends from the spleen to the left iliac region ; it is longer than the right co- lon ; it is connected to the left kidney and psoas muscle by the peritonaeum and cellular membrane. The sigmoid flexure is connected so loosely in the iliac fossa, that a great portion of it often lies in the pel- vis ; this part of the colon is partially covered by the small intestines, and is connected to the psoas and iliac mtiscles, to the ureter and spermatic vessels. The rectum extends from the sigmoid flexure of the colon to the anus; it commences opposite the left ilio- sacral articulation, and descends obliquely towards the middle line as far as the lower end of the sacrum ; it then bends forwards towards the perinreum, and lastly turning downwards, it ends at the anus. The rectum is connected posteriorly to the sacrum and coccyx by the meso-rcctum superiorly, and by vessels and nerves in- teriorly : anteriorly the rectum is connected to the pe- ritonaeum above, and below, in the male subjecr, to the inferior fundus of the bladder, the vesicultc seminales,

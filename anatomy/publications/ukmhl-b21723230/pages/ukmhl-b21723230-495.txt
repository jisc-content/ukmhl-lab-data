for the base of the third metacarpal; the base of the third is nearly plane, and rests on the magnum, and presents on either side articulating surfaces for the contiguous me- tacarpal bones ; the base of the fourth presents two arti- culating surfaces, one for the magnum, and one for the unciform ; on the radial side two, and on the ulnar side one articulating surface, for the adjacent metacarpal bones ; the base of the fifth presents a concave surface, directed outwards to articulate with the unciform ; its ra- dial side articulates with the base of the fourth metacarpal bone. The anterior, or digital ends of all the metacarpal bones are convex, their smooth surfaces extending further on the palmar than on the dorsal surfaces of each ; they are arriculated with the bases of the first phalanges. The Fingers are composed each of three phalanges, except the thumb, which has only two ; there are there- fore fourteen phalanges in all ; the first, or those next the metacarpus, are the largest, the third are the smallest, the second, or middle, are of an intermediate size. The metacarpal, or the first phalanges, are five in number; the base or posterior end of each presents an oval cavity for the head of the metacarpal bone; the anterior extremity of each presents two small condyles, separated by a groove ; these are prolonged anteriorly, and articulate with the second or middle phalanx ; the anterior surface of each is arched from before backwards, hollowed from side to side, to lodge the flexor tendon, the sheath of which is attached to its lateral edges ; the posterior sur- face is convex and arched. The second or middle pha- langes arc four in number, they are smaller than the first; the base of each presents a pully-like surface to articulate w’ith the first, with which it forms ginglymoid joint; about the centre of their anterior surface is a rough depression for the insertion of the tendon of the flexor sublimis ; the anterior or digital extremity of each resembles the ante- rior end of the first phalanx, and is convex from before backwards, and concave from side to side ; the two arti- culating condyles being prolonged on the palmar further than on the dorsal surface, so as to increase the extent of flexion ; the thumb wants this second phalanx. The third or last or ungual •phalanges are five in number, they are the smallest, somewhat of a pyramidal form; the

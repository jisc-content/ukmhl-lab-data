164 each proceeds a branch of the hepatic veins and ducts.' Through the liver, therefore, four sets of vessels ramify, in addition to numerous. lymphatics, viz, the branches of the hepatic arteries, venae portarum, hepatic ducts and hepatic veins; the venae portarum are supposed to be the A'essels from which the bile is secreted: the he- patic arteries nourish the substance of the liver; the hepatic ducts carry the bile from, this organ, and the venae cavae hepaticae return the blood which has circu- lated through the liver, to the inferior venae cavae, just as this vessel is passing through the diaphragm. The vencc cavcB hepaticce, three or four in number, are seen escaping from the liver at the superior thick edge, be- hind the coronary ligament, -and immediately joining the inferior or ascending venae cavae. The three other vessels of the liver may be seen between the layers of the lesser omentum, the artery lying to the left side, the biliary duct to the right, the vena porta behind and between both; the artery and vein de- scend obliquely inwards towards the spine, behind the pancreas. The hepatic artery is a branch of the coeliac axis, and the vena porta commences in front of the last dorsal vertebra and behind the pancreas. The right and left hepatic ducts, on clearing the transverse fissure, unite and form the hepatic duct, which descends for about one inch and a half along the right side of the lesser omentum, is then joined by the cystic duct, from the gall-bladder: the union of these forms the ductus communis choledochus; this vessel, about three inches long,' descends vertically behind the pylorus, the upper part of the duodenum and the pancreas, and is imbedded in the substance of the latter, about the middle of the internal or concave side of the middle division of the duodenum; this duct perforates the coats of this intes- tine in a very oblique direction, and opens on a small papilla internally, opposite the lower angle of the duo- denum : as the ductus choledochus is about to perforate the duodenum, it is in general joined by the duct from the pancreas. The gall bladder is situated in the right hypochon- drium in a depression on the inferior surface of the right lobe of the liver; this membranous sac is of a p^Tiform figure; the large extremity or fundus being directed

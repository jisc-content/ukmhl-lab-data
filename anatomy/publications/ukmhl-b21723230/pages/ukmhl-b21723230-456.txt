438 lary and palate bones, the upper border has often a notch or two which assist in forming the internal or- bital holes. The aethmoid bone contributes to form the base of .the cranium, the nose, and the orbits; it has little or no cellular tissue in its composition except in the turbinated plates and the crista galli; it is deve- loped by three points of ossification, one for the central lamella and one for each side, the latter appear first, the turbinated plates are not distinct until five years of age: it is joined to two bones of the cranium, the frontal and sphenoid, and to eleven of the face, the nasal, superior maxillaiy, lachrymal, palate, inferior spongy, and the vomer. The Sphenoid Bone is so named from the manner in which it is wedged into the base of the skull, in the middle of which it is placed, it is articulated to all the bones of the cranium, and to many of those of the face, it is of a very irregular form, and has been com- pared to a bat, to which it bears some resemblance, particularly if the aethmoid remain attached; it may be divided into a body and processes, the body is in the centre, and resembles a square box; from its median line inferiorly proceeds the azygos process, or the rostrum, which is received between the layers of the vomer, on each si3e of this is a small groove for ves- sels ; the body is flat and rough posteriorly for attach- ment to the basilar process, anteriorly it presents the two small round openings of the sphenoid sinus, be- neath which are often found two small triangular bones, the spongy or turbinated bones of the sphenoid, or of Bertifa; the superior or cerebral surface of the body presents several remarkable appearances, it is hollowed from before backwards into the deep depression called sella turcica, this lodges the pituitary gland, and is perforated by several holes through which small ves- sels pass to the nose, posteriorly it is bounded by a thin plate which rises perpendicularly, and has a slight knob at each angle named the posterior clinoid processes, to each of these the extremity of the convex edge of the falx is attached, anterior to the sella is an emi- nence named the olivary process, on it is a transverse depression for the optic commissure, on each side of

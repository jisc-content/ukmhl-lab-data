488 place in the situation of the glandulae agminatae; ulce- ration however does not appear to be so common in the small as in the great intestines; in dysenteric affec- tions of the great intestines, a great portion of the inner membrane is found hanging in shreds, occasioned by the great ravages of the ulceration; while in some places, large patches of the mucous membrane have been totally stripped off, leaving the submucous coat quite bare, and appearing as if it had been dissected; where this unfortunately happens, the mucous mem- brane is never afterwards repaired. Liver. The peri- toneal coat covering the liver, is not uncommonly found in a state of inflammation, it is either affected by itself, or is included in general peritonitis ; where the former happens, the anterior or convex surfaces are generally the parts inflamed, the same appearances exist, as de- scribed when speaking of peritonitis, viz. : great crowd- ing of small vessels containing florid blood, increased thickness and pulpiness of the membrane and an effu- sion of coagulable lymph on the surface, w'hich when or- ganized forms permanent adhesions to the neighbouring viscera, and are found to exist more or less in every adult dead body. When the substance of the liver is inflamed (which is a rare occurrence in these countries,) it becomes enlarged in size and of a purple colour, and harder to the touch than in its healthy state; if the inflammation continue for any length of time, abscesses are formed, which in some cases contain many pints of pus; in persons labouring under an absceSs of this kind, contracted in a w'arm climate, the liver will be found almost entirely converted into a bag holding nothing but pus. From the adhesions of the viscera from the previous inflammation, these abscesses generlally dis- charge themselves by ulcerated openings into the sto- mach, transverse arch of the colon, or some coil of the small intestine. Tubercles of ilie liver. To describe the different kinds of tubercles mentioned by authors, is not our in- tention, as it wâ€™ould only tend to embarrass the student, without being of any essential service to him, more par- ticularly as writers themselves do not quite agree in Iheir description of them. One of the most common

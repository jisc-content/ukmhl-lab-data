227 these muscles, and in rotation of the leg inwards the lesser trochanter projects between them; the middle portion, which is inserted into the linea aspera, is inter- nal to the insertion of the glutaeus maximus, and to the origin of the short head of the biceps. This part of the muscle is perforated by several branches of the perfo- rating arteries; at the lower part of the linea aspera this muscle appears to separate into two portions, one of which is inserted into the linea aspera, bet^veen the vastus internus and the short head of the biceps; the other is continued into the long tendon which is inserted into the inner condyle. The adductor magnus is covered internally by the gracilis, and anteriorly by the long and short adductors, the pectinaeus, part of the sartorius, and the femoral vessels; posterior to it are the sciatic nerve, and the hamstring muscles; the tendinous inser- tion of the lower part of this muscle is intimately con- nected to the vastus internus : about the inferior fourth of the thigh there is a large oblique opening between these two muscles, through which the femoral vessels pass into the poplitaeal space. Use, the three adductors, in addition to adducting the limb, can rotate it out- wards ; they also serve to steady and support the pelvis on the thigh ; the long and short adductors can also flex the thigh on the pelvis, and the adductor magnus can extend it. In dissecting the preceding muscles, w'e observe the following vessels and nerves : The Femoral Artery passes from under Poupart’s ligament about midway between the symphysis pubis and the spine of the ilium: it thence descends ob- liquely inwards and backw’ards, and about the lorver part of the middle third of the thigh it perforates the tendon of the adductor magnus, enters the poplitaeal space, and then receives the name of poplitaeal artery. In the upper third of the thigh, or in the inguinal re- gion, the artery is covered only by the skin, superficial fa.scia, some lymphatic glands, and the fascia lata ; in the middle third of the thigh it receives the additional covering of the sartorius, and beneath this a very strong tendinous aponeurosis, which passes from the tendons of the adductor longus and magnus over the arterj" and

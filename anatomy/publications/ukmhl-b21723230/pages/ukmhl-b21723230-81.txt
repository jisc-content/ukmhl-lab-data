63 vided intoâ€”1st, the anterior part, or anterior mediasti- num, which has been already examined; 2d, into a mid- dle part, or middle mediastinum, containing the heart and pericardium ; and 3d, into a posterior mediastinum, which lies in front of the vertebrae, and w'hich the stu- dent may next examine. The posterior mediastinum extends in a vertical direc- tion from the 3d to the 10th dorsal vertebra, behind the pericardium and roots of the lungs, and in front of the spine ; to obtain a view of the parts contained in it, draw the right lung forward, and to the left side, and make a perpendicular division of the right pleura, be- tween the root of the lung and the spine. This region is described as being of a triangular form, the base pos- teriorly, the pleurae forming its sides, and the pericar- dium its apex ; like the anterior mediastinum however, it has naturally no e.xact figure, the pleurae being folded round the organs which lie between them. In the pos- terior mediastinum we find the oesophagus and 8th pair of nerves, the thoracic duct, vena azygos, descending aorta, splanchnic nerves, several lymphatic glands, and a considerable quantity of fine, loose cellular membrane ; the division of the trachea also is enclosed in this space, just at its commencement. The oesophagus is anterior to the other parts in the posterior mediastinum; this tube having passed behind the left division of the tra- chea, enters this space, and descends obliquely forwards behind the pericardium and before the aorta; above, it lies to the right side of this vessel, but below it is to the left; in the lower part of its course it is surrounded by branches of the 8th pair of nerves, and enlarging a little, it perforates the fleshy part of the diaphragm, opposite the 9th or 10th dorsal vertebra, and joins the stomach. The 8t/t pair of nerves having passed behind the roots of the lungs, attach themselves to the oesophagus, form by their branches a plexus around it, (the oesophageal plexus:) the left nerve then descends on the fore, and the right on the back part of this tube to the stomach. The thoracic aorta enters this region about the 4th or 5th dorsal vertebra, and descends along the left side of the spine; about the 11th or 12th dorsal vertebra it passes between the crura of the diaphragm into the ab-

There is much diflBculty experienced in distinguishing inflammation of this membrane from its natural state ; this depends on the great number of small vessels •which naturally ramify on it; however, in the inflamed state they become much more numerous, and by their anastomosis, make a beautiful reticulated ap- pearance, not however causing such a general redness as may be observed in the inflammation of some other membranes; and when the inflammation runs high, pus is fonned ■ndiich is effused on the whole upper surface of the brain. Next in order to inflammation, the most common morbid appearance found in the pia mater is the formation of small cysts, containing water, which are generally called hydatids; these are found more usually on the choroid plexus, and in the velum interpo- situm. Inflammation of the substance of the brain is occasionally observed arising from external injury; the redness, rvhich is generally slight, is confined to one par- ticular part; in this state, when cut into, the colour ap- pears to arise from a great many small vessels which are filled wdth red blood; the inflamed part is softer and more yielding than natural, giving rise to an appearance which has been lately described by French writers, and called “ ramollissementwhen the inflammation pro- ceeds further, abscesses holding pus are formed, which, if of a large size, break dowm the substance of the brain, and present a very jagged appearance on their internal surface. Apoplexy, an effusion of blood either on the surface or in the substance of the brain, is also to be met -w'ith, and occasionally into some of the ventricles, producing the disease called apoplexy; the blood found in those situations is almost always coagulated; however, w'hen the person has long survived the apoplectic attack, the coagulated blood appears to be taken up by absorp- tion, and its place supplied bj' a fluid of an albuminous nature. Hydrocephalus. This is one of the most common affections of the brain; in this disease, water is found accumulated in the ventricles, amounting to a few ounces, or to so many' pints ; the water, by raising up the anterior part of the fornix, passes from one late-

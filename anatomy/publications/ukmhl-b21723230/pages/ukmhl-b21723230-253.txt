235 is covered by the peritonseum, the pelvic fascia, levator ani muscle, and by a strong aponeurosis, termed the obturator fascia, which serves to give origin to some fibres both of the obturator muscle and of the levator ani, between which it is interposed ; the obturator fas- cia is the external layer of the pelvic fascia ; it adheres superiorly to the ilium and pubis, and is inserted infe- riorly into the great sciatic ligament, into the tubero- sity and ramus of the ischium, also into the ramus of the pubis, it here becomes continuous with the trian- gular ligament of the urethra; this fascia is closely con- nected to the obturator intemus muscle, except infe- riorly where the internal pudic nerve and vessels inter- vene. As the obturator tendon is passing through the sciatic notch, its deep surface is divided into four or five distinct tendons, w'hich are lined by the synovial membrane, and connected to each other like so many plaits or folds ; the pudic vessels lie external lo this tendon in this situation ; the continuation of the tendon to its insertion has the same relations as the gemini muscles. Quadratus Femoris, arises by fleshy and aponeu- rotic fibres from the external surface of the tuber ischii, anterior to the tendon of the semi-membranosus, the fibres pass transversely outwards, and are inserted tendinous and fleshy into the inferior and posterior part of the great trochanter, and into the posterior inter- trochanteric line. Use, to adduct and rotate the thigh outwards : this muscle is covered by the glutaeus max- imus and sciatic nerve; its origin is also concealed by the hamstrings ; it is parallel to and between the ge- mini and the adductor magnus ; its lower border is overlapped by the latter ; it covers the obturator ex- ternus, the lesser trochanter, and the insertion of the psoas and the iliacus. Divide this muscle, and a little dissection will expose the following, particularly if the gracilis, adductor, and pectinseus muscles have been pre- viously removed. Obturator Externus, situated at the superior, posterior, and internal part of the thigh, somewhat n triangular or pyramidal, the base towards the pubes, the apex at the trochanter, arises fleshy from the in-

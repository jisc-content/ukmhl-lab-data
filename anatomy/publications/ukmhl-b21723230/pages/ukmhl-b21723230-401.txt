383 the ulna, one branch from the little finger is named the vena salvatella, the others are irregular in number and size, it ascends along the ulnar side of the fore-arm, be- fore the internal condyle, where it is joined by the median basilic vein, it then continues to ascend along the inner side of the arm, accompanying the brachial vessels, and near the axilla it joins one of the venae comites or the axillary vein itself. The median vein arises a little above the wrist, ascends along the middle of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, it here divides into two branches, one (median basilic) joins the basilic vein, the other (median cephalic) joins the cephalic vein; sometimes a third branch joins one of the deep veins. The deep veins accompany the brachial artery and its branches in the arm and fore-arm, two with each; these end in the axillary vein, which as- cends in front of the artery, receives the thoracic veins, passes beneath the clavicle, and is then named subcla- vian vein; this passes inwards over the anterior scalenus, receives several veins from the shoulder and side of the neck, also the external jugular and vertebral veins, and opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation unites with the internal jugular vein to form the vena innominata, which on the right side is a short trunk that descends into the thorax behind the sterno-thyroid muscle, and opposite the cartilage of the first rib joins that from the left side, which is longer, and takes a more transverse course as it enters the chest, in front of the trachea, and of the arteria innominata ; this vein receives several branches from the thyroid gland and from the anterior mediastinum. The vena cava superior or descendens commences opposite the first costal cartilage on the right side, descends obliquely inwards in front of the right pulmonary vessels, enters the pericardium, and opposite the third or fourth cartilage it opens into the right auricle ; as it enters the pericardium it is joined by the vena azygos which commences by a small branch on the first lumbar vertebra, which often communi- cates with the inferior vena cava; this vein then ascends through the aortic opening of the diaphragm into the posterior mediastinum along the right side of the dorsal

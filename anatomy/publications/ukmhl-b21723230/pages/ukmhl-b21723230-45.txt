27 c 2 the siibmaxillary gland,. the facial and lingual arteries ; the 9th and gustatory nerves, ser'^eral snaall muscles, Svhicli connect the tongue and os hyoides to the chin, also the sublingual gland, which cannot be seen in the presenft stage of the dissection. The student should ex- amine the connexions of the submaxillary gland before he dissects the muscles in this region. The submaxillary is the second of the salivary glands, of an oval form and pale colour, surrounded by cellu- lar membrane and several absorbent glands, covered by the skin, platysma and fascia, bounded posteriorly by the digastric tendon, externally by the internal pterygoid muscle and stylo-maxillary ligament; ante- riorly by the side of the maxilla, and internally by the anterior belly of the digastric; it rests on the mylo- stylo-hyoid and hyo-glossus muscles; a small process of the gland accompanies its excretory duct, turns round the posterior edge of that muscle, and lies be- tween its upper surface and the membrane of the mouth; this process frequently joins the sublingual gland. The facial artery and vein pass through a deep groove in this gland. The duct of this gland is called Whartonian duct, it arises by numerous fine ra- dicles from the lobules of the gland, leaves it at its outer end, winds above the mylo-hyoid muscle, and runs for- wards and inwards towards the frsenum linguae, by the side of which it opens into the mouth ; the orifice can be distinctly seen in a prominent papilla, which appears when the anterior part of the tongue is raised: this duct is about two inches and a half long, is thin and transparent, its coats are weaker, but its caliber is larger than in Stenoâ€™s duct: the gustatory nerve accom- panies this duct, at first superior but afterwards inferior to it. Detach this gland from the mylo-hyoid, turn it outwards, leaving the duct and deep process to be further examined afterwards ; separate the anterior belly of the digastric from the chin, and we see the following mascle. M YLO-HYoiDEus, triangular, arises from the oblique line (the myloid ridge,) on the inner surface of the side of the maxilla, which line descends obliquely from be- neath the last molar tooth towards the chin ; the fibres

18G ia connected to it by cellular membrane, and in some cases is intimately joined to it. In some subjects a second muscle may be obsen'ed taking a transverse course (the transversalis alter ;) this arises from the ra- mus of the ischium, proceeds obliquely forwards and in- wards, and is inserted into the accelerator urinae. These muscles are very irregular in size in different persons, in some being found very distinct and strong, in others a few pale and scattered fibres only point out their course and situation. Between the three last descril>ed muscles on each side, w'e may remark a triangular space, which is bounded externally by the crus penis and the erector^enis muscle, internally by the urethra and ac- celerator urinae ; the base is posteriorly, and is formed by the transversalis perinaei muscle. This space con- tains a quantity of fat, also the perinaeal artery, veins, and nerves, branches of the pudic vessels and nerves; into this space, on the left side of the perinaeum, the operator must sink his knife in the lateral operation of lithotomy, in order to lay bare the groove in the staff. In this incision the transversalis muscle and artery of the perinaeum must be divided. Next dissect off the erector penis from the crus penis, also the acceleratores urinae muscles from the bulb and corpus spongiosum urethrae; detach the transverse muscle from its attach- ments, and remove tire vessels and cellular membrane out of the triangular space just now described; then press the bulb of the urethra to one side, from the crus penis, and between these two bodies we may observe a strong ligamentous substance, the fibres passing in dif- ferent directions; this is the triangular ligament of the urethra or the inter-osseous ligament of the perinceum. The apex of this ligament is above, and is weak and cellular, being lost in front of the symphysis pubis, on the dorsal vessels of the penis; the sides are connected to the rami of the pubis and ischium; its base is directed towards the rectum, being connected in the middle line to the central point of the periuceum, on each side of which it is thin and weak, and gradually lost on the surface of the levator ani. Tlirough this ligament the urethra passes, about an inch below the inferior edge of the symphysis pubis, and as this canal passes through

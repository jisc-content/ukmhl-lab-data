406 is also a posterior ligament, which is attached to the adjoining surfaces of the two bones; the head of the astragalus is articulated to the navicular bone, the end of the os calcis is also connected to the latter by a strong fibro-cartilaginous substance called Calceo-navieular li- gament ; this extends from the inferior surface of the os calcis to the inferior part of the navicular, though not at- tached to the astragalus, it supports it, and completes the cavity for receiving its head; this ligament is strength- ened by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which in this situation frequently contains a sesamoid bone or carti- lage. A thin broad ligament above also connects the astragalus to the navicular. The os calcis is attached to the cuboid by a synovial membrane and superior and in- ferior ligaments; the latter is very strong, radiated an- teriorly, and attached to the third and fourth metatar- sal bones. This articulation is exactly opposite to that between the astragalus and navicular bone ; the opposite sides of the cuboid and navicular bones are connected by ligaments, and sometimes by a synovial membrane. The three cuneiform bones are attached to the navicular by a synovial membrane which also extends between these: they are all secured by superior and inferior transverse and oblique ligamentous bands. The meta- tarsal bones are secured to the tarsus and to each other by dorsal and plantar ligaments ; the three internal are articulated to the cuneiform bones, and the two external to the cuboid bones ; all the metatarsal bones are also articulated to each other posteriorly by synovial mem- branes, except the first and second ; the anterior end of each metatarsal bone is connected to the first phalanx, and the phalanges to each other by synovial membranes and lateral ligaments as in the upper extremity.

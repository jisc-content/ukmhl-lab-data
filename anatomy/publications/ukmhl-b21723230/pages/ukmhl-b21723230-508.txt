490 approaching the nature of cancer, and one or two cases of abscess in its substance have been described. Kidneys. From the loose connexion which the peritoneum has with the capsule of the kidney, this membrane is not so liable to be inflamed in peritonitis, as the investing membranes of other org'ans; the substance however is often inflamed, and is very much disposed to form ab- scesses. Abscesses of the kidney are of two kinds; one, which is the scrofulous, being the most common, con- taining white curdy pus, the other generally arises from the irritation produced by calculi, and bears all the ap- pearances of phlegmonous abscess ; in the first instance they destroy the mammillary portion, and if they pro- ceed, the whole structure of the kidney is destroyed, leaving nothing but a capsule, lined with a pulpy sub- stance, which the walls of the abscess secreted. Hyda- tids. Hydatids are often found between the substance of the kidney and its capsule; they are not enclosed in firm cysts, nor are their coats so thick as those found in the liver; another distinction remarked, is, that in the kidney they are generally all of the same size, while in the liver they vaiy very much, as has been already men- tioned. Calculi. The formation of calculi is not pecu- liar to the kidneys, but it is a more frequent disease in them than in any other part of the body; sometimes they are small, and are found in the tubular portion, but more commonly one calculus of considerable size is met with, lodged in the substance of the kidney or fill- ing up the pelvis of the ureter; when it is so large as not to be capable of passing through the ureter, addi- tional calculous matter is laid on, and in its growth it is necessarily accommodated by the parts which contain it, and becomes branched in its shape from extending into the infundibula. When a calculus in the pelvis of the kidney has increased to a large size, it almost prevents the passage of the urine into the ureter, the urine be- comes accumulated above the stone, and enlarges the pelvis and infundibula. If there be obstruction to the passage of urine, from a stone being lodged in the extre- mity of the ureter near the bladder, not only is the pel- vis of the kidney greatly enlarged, but the ureter itself partakes of the dilatation; as this process advances, the

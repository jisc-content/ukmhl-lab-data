228 vein, and joins the tendon of the vastus intemus; ia this part of the thigh the artery is enclosed in a perfect tendinous sheath, consisting anteriorly of the aponeu- rosis just mentioned, posteriorly and internally of the tendons of the adductors, and externally of the vastus internus: at the lower end of the sheath the artery passes into the ham through a large oval opening which is bounded superiorly by the adductor longus and magnus, externally by the vastus internus, internally by the adductor magnus, and inferiorly by the united tendons of the adductor magnus and vastus intemus. The femoral artery in this course first passes over a few- fibres of the psoas, next over the pectinaeus and ad- ductor brevis, the adductor longus, and a small portion of the magnus. The femoral artery, immediately below' Poupart’s ligament, gives off, 1st, some cutaneous branches; 2d, small arteries to the inguinal glands; 3d, about two inches below Poupart’s ligament, a very large branch, the profunda; 4th, several muscular branches to the sartorius and vastus internus; and 5th, just before it enters the ham, the anastomotica magna, which is dis- tributed to the muscles and integuments at the inner side of the knee. The profunda is the largest branch of the femoral; it descends behind that vessel and to its inner side, and gives several branches to the muscles of the thigh, namely, the external and internal circumflex, and the three or four perforating arteries. (See Ana- tomy of the Vascular System.) The femoral vein takes the same course as the artery; in the groin it always lies to its internal or pubic side, but as it descends it becomes posterior to it. In dissecting the muscles on the fore-part of the thigh, numerous branches of the anterior crural nerve are met with : this nerve in the groin is separated into several branches, many of these become cutaneous, others pass to the muscles on the fore-part of the thigh, and two or three accompany the femoral artery; one of these, the nerviis saphe7i2is, enters its tendinous sheath, and descending along the fgre-part of the arteiy, as far as the opening- in the ten- don of the triceps, then leaves that vessel, descends be- tween the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis muscles

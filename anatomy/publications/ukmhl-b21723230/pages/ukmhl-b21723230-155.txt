137 middle portion of the fascia lata is very thin, and has been termed the cribriform fascia; this extends from the saphena vein to Poupart’s ligament, and is connected on either side to the pubic and iliac portions of the fascia lata. The cribriform fascia covers the femoral vessels, and is perforated by the lymphatic vessels passing to the iliac glands ; this portion of the fascia lata is more closely connected than any other to the superficial fascia; in- deed in structure it resembles the superficial more than the fascia lata, nor are its fibres directly continued from those of the fascia lata ; some have therefore con- sidered the cribriform fascia as a deep lamina of the su- perficial fascia; in many cases, however, it has an apo- neurotic structure, and appears to be clearly derived from the iliac portion, and inserted into the pubic portion of the fascia lata ; it presents much variety in this respect. The external or iliac portion of the fascia lata is very dense and strong, it is continued from the external sur- face of the thigh, and is intimately attached superiorly to the spine of the ilium, and to Poupart’s ligament; and uniting with the cribriform fascia, is continued in front of the femoral vessels, along with the inferior fibres of Poupart’s ligament, and is inserted along with these into the linea innominata, thus assisting to form the external part or the base of Gimbernaut’s ligiament. If the cri- briform fascia be removed along with the superficial fascia, then the iliac portion of the fascia lata will pre- sent the appearance of a crescentic ox falciform process, extending across the femoral vessels, the concavity of which process will look downwards and inwards: the inferior cornu joins the external cornu of the saphenic opening, and the superior cornu is inserted along with the posterior fibres of Poupart’s ligament or Gimber- naut’s ligament into the linea innominata, on the internal border of the crural ring; although this crescentic pro- cess appears to present a defined edge, yet if the latter be examined closely it will be found reflected backwards on the sheath of the vessels and on the muscles, in the same manner as the apparent edge at the lower part of the sa- phenic opening. Next direct your attention to the internal surface of the crural arch, and to the connexion between it and the

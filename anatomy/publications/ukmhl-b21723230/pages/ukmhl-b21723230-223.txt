205 of the epigastric artery ; it then enters the spermatic cord, and is conducted to the back part of the testicle ; it divides into several branches which enter the rete tes- tis ; these subdivide minutely as they proceed into the substance of the testicle, in which they terminate in the commencement of the tubuli seminiferi and of the sper- matic veins. The last named vessels leave the rete testis, twine around the arteries, and then ascend in the sper- matic cord ; a little above the testicle these vessels be- come very tortuous, and form a plexus, which is named the Corpus Pampiniforme : the spermatic veins then ac- company the spermatic artery through the inguinal ca- nal and along the psoas muscle tOAvards the spine ; the spermatic vein on the right side generally ends in the inferior cava near the entrance of the right renal vein ; the spermatic vein on the left side frequently ends in the left renal vein. The nerves of the testicle are de- rived chiefly from the spermatic plexus, which is foriped by the union of branches from the lumbar ganglions of the sympathetic, â– with filaments from the splanchnic nerves and from the renal plexus ; the cremaster muscle is also supplied by branches from the lumbar plexus of spinal nerves, hence this muscle is, to a certain extent, voluntary. The Vesiculce seminales are two in number ; they are situated on the inferior surface of the bladder behind and above the prostate gland, on the outer side of the vasa deferentia, and anterior to the rectum ; each is of an oval figure, about two inches long and half an inch broad ; the superior and posterior extremity is round, and in .contact with the ureter ; the anterior extremity is narrow, con- nected to the prostate gland, and ends in a small duct which joins the vas deferens ; the union of these forming the common seminal or ejaculatory duct, which latter passes obliquely forwards and inwards through the pros- tate gland, and opens into the urethra by the side of the verumontanum. Although the vesiculge look like a con- geries of cells, yet by dissection they may be unravelled, 80 as to appear as one continued tube convoluted or coiled very much, the different coils communicating with each other; these organs are covered by a dense fascia, which

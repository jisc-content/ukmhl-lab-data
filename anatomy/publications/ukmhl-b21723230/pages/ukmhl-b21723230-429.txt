411 T 2 small and oval; the spinous processes are long, of a pris- matic or triangular form, bent downwards very much, or imbricated, and tubercular at their extremities. The first has the body long transversely, and on either side a full depression above for the head of the first rib, and half of a similar cavity below for the upper part of the head of the second rib ; its spinous process is thick, long, and ho- rizontal, and its articular processes are oblique ; the tenth hasiulso a fall depression for the tenth rib, the eleventh and twelfth in like manner ; these also want the articu- lating depressions on the transverse processes; the twelfth also resembles the' lumbar, in the shape of its body, and inferior articular processes. The cervical vertebrce are seven in number and smaller than the others ; their body is long transversely, a little deeper before than behind; the lower surface is concave from behind forwards, the upper is larger or broader, and. concave from side to side ; the structure is more compact than in the dorsal and lumbar; the lamince are long and narrow, sharp and small superiorly, rotind and large in- feriorly, so as to overlap those below ; the spinal hole is large and triangular ; the notches are small and anterior to the articular processes ; they are nearly of equal size above and below ; the spinous process is short, horizontal and bifid ; the transverse process is short, bifid, grooved above for the nerves, and perforated near its base by a round hole for the vertebral vessels ; it is on a plane an- terior to the transverse processes of the back or loins, and appears, on account of its foramen, to have a second or anterior root from the body of the vertebra: the articular processes are oblique, the superior oval, slightly convex, look upwards and backwards ; the inferior also oval, are concave, and directed downwards and forwards. The first cervical vertebra or atlas differs from the re- maining, in having a mere bony ring, Avithout any dis- tinct body or spinous process, the anterior part of this ring is tubercular before, but presents posteriorly a smooth and concave oval articulating surface which re- ceives the odontoid process of the second vertebra : the margin of this ring gives attachment to ligaments ; it is romid and thick behind, with a tubercle, instead of

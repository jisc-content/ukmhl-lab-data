179 Quadratvs Lumbqruj^, is a thick, flat muscle, between the anterior and middle layers of the transver- salis abdominis tendon, posterior to the psoas, the kidney and the diaphragm ; and anterior to the sacro-lumbalis; it arises tendinous frqm the posterior fourth of the spipe of the ilium, and from the ilio-lumbar ligament ; the fibres ascend obliquely inwards, and are inserted into the extremity of the transveTse processes of the four first lumbar vertebras, aud of the last dorsal; also into the internal surface pf the posterior half of the last rib. Use; to bend the spine tp one side, to depress the last rib, thus assisting in expiration ; when both muscles act they support the spinsd column in the perpendicular direction. Psoas Parvus arises fleshy from the side of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra, ends in a long flat tendop, which descends on the inner side of the Psqas raagnus, and is inserted broad and thin into the linea ilip-pectonaea, or brim of the pelvis, also into the fascia iliaca and fascia lata, behind the femoral vessels.— Use, it assists in bend- ing the body forwards, or in raising the pelvis ; it also makes tense the crural arch, in consequence of its attach- ment to the fascia lata. This muscle is often wanting; when present, it is situated internal and anterior to the psoas magnus, and is partly concealed by the diaphragm, the renal vessels, the peritonaeum, and at its insertion by the external iliac artery. Psoas Magnus, long, round and thick in the centre, small at its extremities, fleshy at its superior, tendinous at its inferior; it extends alojog the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, of the brim of the pelvis, and the anterior and inner part of the thigh ; it arises fleshy from the side of the body of the two last dorsal, and from the bodies and transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebree, also from the intervertebral ligaments ; the fibres all descend, at first vertically, afterwards obliquely outwards, along the brim of the pelvis, and beneath Poupart’s ligament; the muscle then becomes tendinous, and descends obliquely inwards and backwards, and is inserted tendinous into the back part of the lesser trochanter, also fleshy into a ridge below that process. Use; to flex the thigh on the

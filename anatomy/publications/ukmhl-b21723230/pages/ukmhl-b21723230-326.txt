308 it by a small twig; it descends at first between the two pterygoid muscles; then between the, lower jaw and the internal pterygoid; it is here separated from the latter by the internal lateral ligament; about the middle of the internal surface of the ramus of the jaw it sends off a small filament, the -mylo-hyoid nerve, this descends obliquely forwards, confined in a groove in the bone by an expansion from the internal lateral ligament; near the chin it divides into small branches for the mylo- hyoid, genio-hyoid, and digastric muscles. The dental nerve then enters the canal in the lower jaw, which ex- tends from the dental foramen obliquely forwards be- neath the teeth as far as the chin; in this course, this nerve, which is accompanied by the dental vessels, supplies each of the molar and canine teeth with soft delicate twigs, and at the mental foramen it divides into two branches; one continues its course w'ithin the bone beneath the incisor teeth, the other is the mental nerve; this escapes by the mental foramen, bends up- wards, and divides in a radiated manner into several branches which pass to the muscles, mucous membrane, and integuments of the lower lip, and communicate w'ith the facial nerve. Third, the lingual or gustatory nerve is smaller than the dental, to which it is con- nected by a short branch which encloses a space through which the internal maxillary artery passes ; beyond this branch of communication the corda tj'mpani (which has been before traced from Meckelâ€™s ganglion) joins the ga^statory nerv'e at an acute angle ; the latter is in- creased in size at this spot; the gustatory nerve is here situated between the external pterygoid and the muscles of the palate and pharynx: it then descends obliquely forwards between the internal pterygoid and the ramus of the lower jaw ; it next turns forwards above the sub- maxillary gland and the mylo-hyoid muscle, and lies on the mylo-hyoidean attachment of the superior constric- tor of the pharynx, and on the mucous membrane of the mouth and the hyo-glossus muscle, and accompanies the Whartonian duct; it then ascends above the sublin- gual gland and becomes attached to the lateral and an- terior parts of the tongue. In this course the gustatory nerve gives off, 1st, one or two small filaments to the internal pterygoid muscle; 2nd, several to the tonsils

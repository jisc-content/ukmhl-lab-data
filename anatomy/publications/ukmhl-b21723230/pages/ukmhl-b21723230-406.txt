3S8 the neck, the lymphatics from the left arm and left side of the head, face, and neck, open into it. The lympha- tics of the upper extremities are superficial and deep, the former accompany tlie subcutaneous veins to the el- hoAv, and- a little above the bend of the joint they pass inwards through a small gland that is situated above the inner condyle ; they then join the deep lymphatics, and ascend along the inner side of the arm to the axilla, pass through the axillary conglobate glands, surround the axillary artery, and pass with it beneath the clavicle into the neck, where they are joined by the lymphatics from the neck and shoulder. On the left side these branches end in the thoracic duct ; on the right side they form a short canal (called the right or lesser thoracic duct) which opens into the right or left vena innominata, at the upper part of the anterior mediastinum. ANATOMY OF THE FCETAL CIRCULATION. Th e umbilical vein which arises by numerous branche.s from the placenta, and extends along the umbilical cord, twisted round the umbilical arteries, enters the umbilicus of the foetus, ascends obliquely backwards, enclosed in the duplicature of the falciform ligament, behind the linea alba, and the right rectus muscle ; it arrives at the notch in the anterior edge of the liver, proceeds back- wards along the horizontal fissure, sending branches to either side, particularly to the left lobe, which at thi.s period of life is of considerable size. When the umbi- lical vein arrives near the ti'ansverse fissure, it divides into two branches ; the right or communicating, the left or the ductus venosus, the right is the larger, if passes transversely for about an inch, and joins the trunk of the vena portae; the left, or the ductus ve7iosus, ascends between the left and spigelian lobes towards the diaphragm, and joins the middle hepatic veins just as these are about to join the vena cava. The right auricle distended with blood from the superior and inferior vena cava, then contracts and propels its

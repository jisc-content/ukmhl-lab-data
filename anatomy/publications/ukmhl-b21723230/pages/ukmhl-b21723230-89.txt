71 the right side; its superior cornu is connected to the anterior or the left limbus of the fossa ovalis, and the inferior to the fore part of the vena cava ; this cornu is sometimes continued round that vessel to the posterior limbus of the fossa ovalis ; in the adult and old this valve is often reticulated and imperfect ; in the foetus it is generally more perfect and large, hence it is consi- dered by many as being of use at that period in direct- ing the blood from the inferior cava at once into the left auricle through the foramen ovale, and preventing its mixing with that from the superior cava. To the left side of the Eustachian valve, between it and the ventricle, is the orifice of the coronary vein, which is also partly covered by a semilunar fold of membrane, the valve which secures this opening against the re- entrance of the blood during the contraction of the auri- cle ; this valve also is often imperfect; on different parte of the auricle small orifices maybe often seen, {foramina Thebesii;) these are probably the extremities of small veins. In the anterior part of the auricle we see the small circular opening of the appendix, inferior to which, and opposite the tuberculum Loweri, is the large orifice leading into the right ventricle ; this, the right auriculo- ventricular opening, is circular, and surrounded by a dense white line, which has been erroneously described as the right tendon of the heart. We may next ex- amine the right ventricle; for this purpose open its cavity, by raising the anterior wall in the form of a flap from below, making one incision along its right side, and the other near the septum cordis. The right ventricle is triangular, its base is joined to the auricle, the apex Is a little above the apex of the heart ; the right is separated from the left ventricle by a thick muscular lamina (the septwTO corcfis;) the parietes of this cavity are rendered very irregular internally by numerous muscular projections, the carnecB columnce ; some of these are attached throughout their whole length, others are fixed by their extremities, and loose in their centre, and a third species are fixed by one end to the fleshy sub- stance of the heart, by the other to thin tendinous cords which are attached to the auricular valves ; the camccs

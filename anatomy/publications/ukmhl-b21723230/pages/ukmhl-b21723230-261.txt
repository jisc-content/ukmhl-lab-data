243 M 2 the thigh this vein is accompanied by small nen'es, whrch are derived from the lumbar plexus and from the anterior crural; along the leg the saphenus nerve, a branch of the anterior crural, is attached to it, and winds round it. The posterior or external saphena vein commences behind the external ankle from the junction of several small veins from the integuments of the heel and sole of the foot; it ascends along the sur- face of the gastrocnemius muscle, accompanied by the communicans tibialis nerve ; at the ham this vein in general joins the popliteal vein, but sometimes it here turns inwards and joins the internal saphena vein, with which it always communicates in its course along the leg. Several cutaneous nerves are distributed to the leg, namely, the internal saphenus, from the posterior tibia!,, and several cutaneous branches from the peronaeal and anterior tibial nerves perforate the fascia of the leg on its outer and anterior part, and are distributed to the inte- guments of the leg and foot. The fascia of the leg is derived partly from that of the thigh; it also receives additional fibres from the tendons around the knee joint, namely, the rectus and vasti anteriorly: the vastus externus and biceps exter- nally ; the sartorius, gracilis, and inner hamstring inter- nally ; the fascia adheres to the head of the tibia and fibula, to the spine of the tibia, near its whole length, to the annular ligaments of the ankle joint, and to the malleoli; it can scarcely be said to exist on the ante- rior surface of the tibia, which is only cove^red by the skin and periosteum. The fascia of the leg is stronger superiorly than inferiorly; near the ankle it again in- creases in strength from its connexion to the malleoli and to the annular ligaments; these are two in number, the anterior and internal. The anterior annular liga- ment is a little above the joint; it is somewhat square, and stronger externally than internally; in the latter situation it is attached to the malleolar process of the tibia, and to the os naviculare; in the former to the external malleolus, and to the upper part of the os cal- cis ; it consists of two layers, which, by separating and re-uniting, form three rings or sheaths for the tibialis anticus, and the two e.xtensor tendons; the anterior

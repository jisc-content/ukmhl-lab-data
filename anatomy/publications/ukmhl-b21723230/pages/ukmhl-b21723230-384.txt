566 of the opposite side ; 2d, the ascending cervical ascends along and is distributed to the anterior scalenus, longus colli, and rectus capitis anticus major muscles; 3rd, suprascapular runs obliquely outwards and downwards beneath the clavicle, passes above the notch in the su- perior costa of the scapula, supplies the supra-spinatus muscle, and descends beneath the acromion process to the infra-spinatus and teres minor muscles ; 4th, trans- versalis colli ascends obliquely outwards round the sca- leni muscles, and beneath the trapezius ; it divides into two branches, one, the cervicalis superJicialis, supplies the superficial muscles on the side and back part of the neck; the other, the posterior scapular artery, de- scends beneath the levator anguli scapulae, and the rhomboid muscles along the base of the scapula as far as the inferior angle, where it inosculates with the subsca- pular artery; the posterior artery of the scapula, as also the supra-scapularinmany subjects, arise distinctly from the subclavian artery. The internal mammary artery arises opposite the thyroid axis; it descends obliquely forwards and inwards, between the cartilages of the ribs and the pleura, as far as the ensiform cartilage, it gives branches to the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum, a long branch to the diaphragm, which accompanies the phrenic nerve, also intercostal branches, which inosculate with the aortic intercostals ; it terminates by sending branches to the diaphragm, and to the abdominal muscles; the latter inosculate with the epigastric artery. The superior intercostal artery arises between the scaleni, descends behind the pleura, in front of the neck of the first and second ribs, and supplies the two first pair of intercostal muscles. The cervicalis profunda arises opposite the last, as- scends obliquely backwaids and outwards, between the transverse processes of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, and ascending on the back of. the neck, sup- plies the complexus and the other deep muscles in that region, and inosculates with the descending branches of the occipital artery. The Axillary artery descends from the lower edge of

483 ral ventricle into the other, and in this manner to the third, and so on to the fourth ; sometimes water is efr fused on the surface of the brain, but this is rare ; the most common situation we find it in is between the arachnoid coat and the pia mater ; sometimes effused in small patches between these two membranes, and at others over a large extent; when this effusion takes place, the vessels of the pia mater are found more distended wth blood than is usual, and the arachnoid membrane is thicker and more opaque than in the natural state; in most cases where this effusion takes place, water is also secreted in the lateral ventricles, and in the sheath of the vertebral canal. Deposition of bony mater in the arteries of the brain may also be looked for; this appear- ance is by no means rare, particularly in old subjects ; arising from this state of arteries, aneurisms of the inter- nal carotids are described by some authors, but they are not of common occurrence. NOUBID APPE.\RANCES OF PARTS CONTAINED IN THE THORAX. Pericardium. The membrane enveloping the heart is also liable to inflammation ; this is not a very common disease, although it occurs sufficiently often to afford opportunities of examining its effects after death : in the inflamed state it is crowded with minute vessels carrying florid blood; it is also a little more pulpy and thicker than it is in its natural state; extravasated coagulable lymph is found loosely connecting it to the heart; this has a reticulated appearance, and portions of it float in the serous fluid, which in this disease is found in the bag of the pericardium. In some inflammations of this membrane large quantities of pus are formed, without any appearance of ulceration, but always accompanied with a thickened state, and a deposition of coagulable lymph on the internal surface of the membrane. The presence of a small quantity of fluid in the pericardium after death, is not to be set down as a morbid appear- ance, or confounded with the disease called hydrops pericardii, as in every healthy body a few drachms of fluid are found in the bag of the pericardium, arising

34G The Memhrana Conjunetiva is a mucous membrane lining each palpebra, and continuous at their margin with the integuments ; it also covers the anterior part of the globe ; near the inner canthus it is thrown into a semi- lunar fold, and is continued through the puncta lachry- malia into the nasal sac and duct, and becomes continuous with the mucous membrane of the nose. This membrane is more vascular on the palpebrse and caruncula than on the surface of the eye ; it is loosely connected to the sclerotic coat to within half an inch of the cornea *, it then becomes so delicate and so adherent that it is difficult to separate it further, and although it is generally described as being continued over the cornea, it is impossible to dissect it from it unless previously macerated or changed by disease ; at the inner canthus of the orbit it is thrown forwards by a fleshy looking tubercle of a conical figure, the caruncula lachrynialis ; this is composed of a few mucous follicles and the bulbs of some fine hairs that pro- ject from its surface. The conjunctiva is a secreting, and according to some, an absorbing surface ; it is con- stantly moistened by the fluid it secretes, and occasion- ally by the lachrymal secretion ; it serves, as its name implies, to join the eye-lids to the ejn, to facilitate the motions of the former, and thereby to clear the surface of the latter ; it also closes the orbit against any extra- neous substance, and serves to support and confine the eye-ball in its several motions. Palpebra are composed of the skin, the orbicular muscle, a thin cartilage connected to the base of the orbit by a cellulo-ligamentous connexion, and lined by conjunctiva ; in the superior there is also the expansion of the levator palpebrse muscle ; the upper is larger than the lower eye-lid, therefore when they are closed the former descends below the transverse axis of the eye, and the inferior ascends but little to meet it ; they are both concave posteriorly, adapted to the surface of the eye, their margins are thick, and furnished anteriorly with the eye-lashes, posteriorly with numerous mucous follicles ; their opposed edges are sloped off obliquely towards the eye, so that when the lids are closed a sort of triangular canal is formed, the base of w;hich is

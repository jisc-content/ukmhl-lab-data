473 The Radius is shorter than the ulna by the length of the olecranon ; it is situated at the outer and anterior part of the forearm, is lai ger below than above, is curved about the centre, and is convex outwards ; it is divided into the body aud two extremities; the upper or humeral end presents a head, neck, and tubercle ; the head is a circu- lar superficial cavity, its surface and circumference co- vered with cartilage ; the former to articulate with the small head of the humerus, and the latter with the sig- moid cavity of the ulna, and with the annular or coronary ligament; the internal or ulnar portion of the circumfer- ence is broader than the external; the neck is about an inch long, it descends obliquely outwards, it is contracted and circular; at its lower extremity is the tubercle, this process is directed backwards and inwards, into its ex- ternal rough surface the tendon of the biceps is inserted; anteriorly it is smooth, and covered by a bursa. The body or shaft of the radius is somewhat triangular, and presents three surfaces, separated by three margins or angles ; the anterior surface is broad below and covered by the pronator quadratus, narrow above where it gives attachment to the flexor pollicis ; about one-third from the head is the orifice of the vascular canal, slanting ob- liquely upwards ; the posterior surface is convex above and covered by the supinator brevis, concave in the middle for the extensors of the thumb, and convex be- low; the external surface is round and convex, and pre- sents near the centre a rough surface for the insertion of the pronator teres ; of the angles or edges the inner is most distinct; it is sharp, and gives attachment to the interosse- ous ligament. The lower or carpal end of the radius is square, its anterior prominent edge gives attachment to the anterior carpal ligament; posteriorly it presents three grooves for the extensor tendons ; one nearly in the mid- dle line, narrow and oblique, lodges the tendon of the ex- tensor secundi intemodii pollicis, the second is at the ul- nar side of this, is broad, and transmits the tendons of the extensor communis and indicator, and the third, which is to the radial side of the first, is divided into two for the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis, longus and brevis ; along the e.xtemal border of this bone, is another groove

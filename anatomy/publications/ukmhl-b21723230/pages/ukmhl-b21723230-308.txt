290 CHAP. II. DISSECTION OF THE MEDULLA SPINALIS. The spinal marrow is contained in a cavity or canal which is bounded by the bodies and processes of the ver- tebras and by their connecting ligaments ; this organ, like the brain, is surrounded by three membranes, which are continuous with those in the cranium. Place the subject on the fore-part, remove the soft parts covering the spine, and with the saw divide the crura of the spinous pro- cesses of all the vertebrae close to the articulating pro- cesses, then with the elevator raise the posterior arch of the spinal canal ; a quantity of loose reddish cellular tis- sue intervenes between the bones and the dura mater, which membrane is loosely connected to them, and does not serve the office of periosteum as in the cranium; it is more closely attached to the ligaments and bones anteriorly than laterally or posteriorly. The dura mater of the spinal canal is termed the theca vertebralis; it is continued from the cranium through the foramen magrium, down the spinal canal as far as the third lumbar vertebra, where it divides into several pro- cesses, which are continued on the sacral ners'es; through- out this e.xtent it regularly sends off a tubular process along each of the spinal nerves ; its external surface is smooth and polished. With the scissors divide this meriibrane along its whole length ; its internal surface will be found lined by the reflected layer of the arach- noid or serous membrane. The arachnoid or the serous membrane in this region has a corresponding appearance to that in the cranium ; it is, however, rather stronger, and more loosely con- nected to the pia mater, so that air or any fine fluid may be impelled between them ; from the sides of the spinal marrow it is regularly reflected along each of the nerves to the dura mater ; these several reflections or folds, when examined in succession, are found to be con- tinuous with each other, and assist in forming the fol- lowing substance, the ligamentum denticulatum; this

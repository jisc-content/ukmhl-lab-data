20 plexus ascending to the parotid gland and external ear. This vein in its course down the neck receives seve- ral cutaneous veins, and frequently communicates with the internal jugular: it presents great varieties in its size and course, and is sometimes even wanting. Su- perficial veins may also in general be marked descend- ing along the anterior part of the neck; they arise about the os hyoides and upper part of the thyroid gland, and descend beneath some fibres of the platysma along the anterior edge of the mastoid muscle, and end in the internal or external jugular, or in the venae inno- minatae. The fibres of the platysma are closely con- nected to a layer of condensed cellular tissue, which in some subjects is very strong, and in some situations aponeurotic; this is the superficial cervical fascia: this fascia extends over the anterior and lateral parts of the neck; is continued down over the forepart of the tho- rax, where it becomes cellular and adipose; ascends to the jaw, to which it is attached; expands over the pa- rotid gland and adheres to the cartilage of the ear; in this situation its strength is greatly increeised ; towards the lateral and posterior parts of the neck it becomes weak like cellular membrane. From the posterior sur- face of this fascia a lamina of membrane is derived, which passes behind the sterno-mastoid muscle; this is the deep cervical fascia, which has some important connexions, which may be examined in this stage of the dissection; the deep fascia arises from the super- ficial, along the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, posterior to which it passes, so that this mus- cle is enclosed between these membranes ; at the lower part of the neck it is strong, and adheres to the inter- clavicular ligament and posterior edge of the sternum. Some loose fatty substance is here interposed between it and the superficial fascia: as the deep fascia extends upwards, it covers and adheres to the sheath of the cer- vical vessels, and arriving at the space between the trapezius and mastoid muscles, it becomes weak and cellular, inferiorly accompanjnng the great vessels be- neath the clavicle, and superiorly lost on the branches

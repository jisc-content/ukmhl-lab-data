480 hammer : if much caution be not used, the saw is verj* likely to lacerate the substance of the brain, owing to the inequality of thickness of the bone. In cases, however, where the head is to be opened for examination into the causes of death, without an intention of pursuing the dissection further, a different mode is generally practised; this is done by making an incision, by the introduction of the point of a knife under the scalp, commencing at one ear, and carried over the vertex to the other ; in this way we avoid cutting the hair, which in a female might be troublesome, and the flaps made by the dissection of the scalp, being reflected over the face and neck, prevent those parts from being- soiled. OPENING THE THORAX AND ABDOMEN. For the purpose of examining the morbid appearances after death, the cavities of the thorax and abdomen are generally opened at the same time ; an incision carried down from the top of the sternum, and ending at the symphysis pubis, dividing the integuments, muscles, and peritonaeum, will bring the latter cavity into view ; next let the skin and muscles covering the front of the thorax be turned back, which will expose the cartilages connect- ing the ribs with the sternum ; immediately at their point of connexion with the bone the cartilages are to be cut; in doing this some caution is to be used ; if not, the vis- cera will sometimes be wounded by the point of the knife slipping down further than is intended ; holding the knife horizontally between the thumb and the middle finger, while the fore-finger is placed on the back of the instru- ment as a guide, will always obviate this inconvenience. In some old subjects, where the cartilages of the ribs are in some degree ossified, they will not yield to the knife, and here a saw is to be employed : all the carti- lages, except those of the first rib being divided, the sternum may now be raised like the lid of a box, and a very convenient hinge is made by cutting the articu- lation of the first joint of the sternum on the inside, directly opposite the second rib ; by following this rule the figure of the thorax will be preserved, after the

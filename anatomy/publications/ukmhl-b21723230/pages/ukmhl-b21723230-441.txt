423 The Os Pubis is situated at the fore-part of the pel- vis, and internal part of the acetabulum; it may be di- vided into its body and processes; the body is the most external, it is thick, and forms the internal and supe- rior part of the acetabulum, above which it joins the ilium in the ilio-pectingeal eminence, and below it is united to the body of the ischium; from this the first process proceeds, the horizontal ramus, forwards and inwards, smooth and flat superiorly, and covered by the pectinaeus, smooth also posteriorly towards the cavity of the pelvis, and grooved beneath for the obturator fora- men ; a sharp ridge separates its superior from its poste- rior surface; this ridge is the anterior part of the linea ilio-pectingea, into it the pectinaeus muscle and Gimber- naut’s ligament are inserted; at the internal extremity of this ramus and of this line is the second process, the tuberosity or spine; this is a prominent tubercle into which Poupart’s ligament is inserted; from this spine the third process, the crest, leads transversely inwards; it is about an inch in length ; the rectus abdominis and pyramidalis muscles arise from it; at its internal end is the fourth process, the symphysis ; this descends nearly vertical, and is joined to the opposite one by an inter- vening cartilage ; as tbe symphysis turns down from the transverse crest there is the angle of the pubis ; from the lower part of the symphysis descends the fifth pro- cess, the inferior or descending ramus in an oblique di- rection backwards and outwards, to meet the ramus of the ischium; this, with the ramus of the opposite pubis, forms the arch of the pubis, its outer edge assists in bounding the thyroid hole. The acetabulum or articular cavity for the head of the thigh bone is formed by the junction of the bodies of these three bones in different proportions; the ischium constitutes a little more than two-fifths, the ilium some- what less than two-fifths, and the pubis the remainder; it is surrounded by a prominence which is deficient or notched at only one point, this notch in the border is opposite the thyroid hole, and between the ischium and pubis, through it the articular vessels pass ; a rough surface, the only part uncovered by cartilage, leads ^ Irom it to the centre of the cavity; to this the articular

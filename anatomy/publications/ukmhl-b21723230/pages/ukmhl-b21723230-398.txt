380 head of the tibia, the external is beneath the external lateral ligament; these arteries pass round the joint to its fore-part, inosculate with the preceding and with the anterior tibial recurrent ; at the lower part of the ham the popliteal divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. The anterior perforates the interosseous space close to the head of the fibula, descends obliquely forwards along the interosseous membrane and over the lower part of the tibia, the synovial membrane of the ankle, and the supe- rior and internal part of the tarsus to the first interosseal space ; in the leg it is overlapped by the tibialis anticus internally, by the extensor communis and extensor pol- licis externally ; it passes beneath the annular ligament of the ankle ; on the tarsus it is covered by the skin and by the internal tendon of the extensor brevis ; it is ac- companied by two veins; the anterior tibial nen'e descends superficial and external to it; it gives off, 1st, the recur- rent, which passes upwards and inwards, and is lost around the articulation of the knee ; 2nd, muscular branches, very numerous, to the muscles on the outer and anterior part of the leg ; 3rd, malleolar branches, which ramify on the external and internal malleoli; on the former they inosculate with the anterior peronseal ; 4th and 5th, tarsal and metatarsal, are distributed to the bones and ligaments of the tarsus and metatarsus; between the two first metatarsal bones it divides into 6th and 7th, the arteria pollicis and the communicans; the former sup- plies the integuments of the great toe ; the latter the first interosseal muscle, and inosculates with the plantar ar- teries. The posterior tibial artery descends obliquely in- wards between the superficial and deep layer of mus- cles on the back of the leg, to the space between the heel and inner ankle, where it divides into the internal and external plantar arteries ; it is covered by the gastrocnemius and solaeus, and lies on the tibialis pos- ticus, flexor communis, and inferiorly on the tibia ; it is accompanied by two veins, and by the posterior tibial nerve, which lies to its external side ; it gives oflf, 1st, several muscular branches to the deep and super-

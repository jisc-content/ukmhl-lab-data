perior external branch which leads to the great trochan- ter and is very long, the adductor magnus, gluteus max- imus, and vastus externus are attached, the internal branch is short and not veiy distinct, it leads to the les- ser trochanter and gives attachment to the adductor brevis, pectinaeus, vastus internus, and some fibres of the iliacus internus ; to the lower and external branch of the linea aspera, the vastus externus and short head of the biceps are attached, and to the lower and internal, the vastus internus and adductor magnus adhere ; these lines conti- nue as low as the condyles, the internal is smooth and nearly obliterated near its middle for the passage of the crural artery. The upper or pelvic extremity of the fe- mur presents three eminences, the head for articulation with the cotyloid cavity and the trochanters for the inser- tion of muscles. The head is of a globular figure, and forms a considerable segment of a sphere, it is directed upwards, forwards and inwards ; a little below its centre, there is a rough depression for the insertion of the round or articular ligament; with the exception of this depres- sion the head is covered throughout with cartilage, it is supported by an elongated process, the neck which forms an angle, more or less obtuse, with the shaft of the bone, the direction of this process is upwards, inwards, and a little forwards, it is flattened before and behind, thicker at the shaft than at the head, its lower edge is longer but smaller than the upper; a rough irregular line separates the head from the neck, beyond which the articular car- tilage does not extend, and at its juncture to the shaft two rough lines extend inwards and downw'ards, from the great to the lesser trochanter, one on the fore the other on the back part of the bone, into these the capsular li- gament is inserted. The great trochanter is continuous w'ith the external side of the shaft, and nearly in a line with its axis, it is on a little lower level than the head, it is thick, rough and square, externally it is broad and convex, the tendon of the gluteus maximus moves over this surface and an intervening bursa, a prominent ridge bounds it below, to this some fibres of the vastus externus are attached, internally it presents a pit or digital cavity which receives the tendons of the external

207 face, and the passage of the urethra above this, have caused this gland to be described as consisting of two lateral portions, called the right and left lateral lobes; these are connected to each other posteriorly by a small transverse process, called the middle lobe ; this may be seen by detaching the vesiculae seminales, and vasa defe- rentia from the bladder, and leaving them suspended by their common ducts, the middle lobe of the prostate will then be seen to pass from one lateral lobe tp the other, and to be closely connected to the mucous membrane of the bladder. The prostate gland has a firm resisting feel, is of a grepsh colour, and appears to possess a very compact structure ; this, however, is chiefly owing to the strong fascia which invests it, and which forms its capsule : the capsule has been already described as being partly de- rived from the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, which expands on the sides and inferior surface of the gland, and partly from the reflection of the pelvic fascia from the pubes, called the anterior ligaments of the blad- der. Next continue the incision which was made in the fore-part of the bladder, through the upper part of the prostate, so as to lay open the urethra, we shall perceive how this gland surrounds the canal, also the greater thickness of its lateral portions. The prostate glands consist of several follicles or acini closely connected to each other, and covered externally by the capsule, and internally by the mucous membrane; these follicles open by several small ducts, ten or twelve, on the lower sur- face of the urethra, on either side of the verumontanum ; some small ducts also open on the upper surface of the canal. The Penis is covered by the common integuments and by the superficial fascia ; the skin is thin and loose ; it is continued from that of the abdomen and scrotum around this organ, and extends some way beyond it in the form of a loose fold, the prepuce; from the extre- mity of this process the skin is reflected inwards as far as the corona glandis, where it becomes very thin ; it is thence continued over the glans penis to the orifice of the urethra, where it is continuous with the lining membrane of the urethra ; inferior to this opening it

187 it, the ligament sends a lamina on it in each direction, one anteriorly on the bulb, the other posteriorly on the membranous portion of the urethra and prostate gland; the former is called the anterior, the latter the poste- rior layer of the triangular ligament, and are separated from each other by Cowper’s glands, and the artery of the bulb. The anterior layer of the triangular liga- ment is expanded on the bulb, and gives to it the pecu- liar glistening appearance it now presents; it also retains . it in its situation, and prevents it being detached, as will appear if you endeavour to draw it out of its place. TTie posterior layer is continued backwards around the membranous part of the urethra to the prostate gland, the capsule for which it forms, and then becomes con- tinuous with the reflections of the pelvic fascia on the neck of the bladder. Diride a few fibres of the ante- rior layer of this ligament, and by a little dissection you will expose on each side of the bulb a small glandular body, Cowper’s or the anti-prostatic glands ; these are two in number, about the size of a small pea, situated at each side of, and behind the bulb, below the mem- branous part of the urethra, between the layers of the triangular ligament, and closely connected to the artery of the bulb; they are covered anteriorly by the accele- ratores urinse muscles, and by the anterior layer of the triangular ligament; from each a small delicate duct, about an inch in length, passes forwards, and opens ob- liquely into the lower and lateral part of the urethra, at a little distance anterior to the bulb. Dissect away all the cellular membrane at the side of the rectum, be- tween it and the tuber ischii, you will thus expose the greater portion of the levator ani muscle; press the rectum to the opposite side, and you will then observe how this muscle, posteriori}’, and the triangular liga- ment, anteriorly, close the inferior opening of the pelvis, and separate this cavity from the perinseum. Divide the triangular ligament on one side from the rami of the pubis and ischium, and draw it over towards the bulb of the urethra, which, together with the rectum, press or fasten with a tenaculum, towards the opposite tuber- osity of the ischium. In separating this ligament from the bone, the pudic artery and its terminating branches

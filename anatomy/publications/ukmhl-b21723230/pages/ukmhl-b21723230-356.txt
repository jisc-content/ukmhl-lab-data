338 and the sphenoid sinus open ; each naris opens posterior- ly into the pharynx, above the velum, by an oblong oval opening; these are separated from each other by the vomer, the internal pterygoid plates bound them exter- nally, the sphenoid above and the palate bones below. To the anterior edge of each naris the cartilages compos- ing the alae nasi are attached, these are five in number, one in the centre, two at each side ; the central cartilage is triangular and vertical, attached superiorly and poste- riorly to the bony septum, its anterior edge is thick and sub-cutaneous, and attached on either side to the lateral cartilages : the lateral cartilages are tw'o, one superior and triangular, attached to bone, the other inferior, and irre- gularly curved, convex externally, and attached to the preceding and to the septum ; in the alae nasi small pieces of cartilage also may be noticed distinct from the larger cartilages. All the internal surface of the nose and of the sinuses communicating wdth it, are lined by a soft, vascular, and highly sensible mucous membrane ; this is the pituitary or Schneiderian membrane ; this mucous membrane is continuous anteriorly with the integuments; it adheres to all the internal surface of the bones of the nose, lines the sinuses, is continuous through the nasal duct with the membrana conjunctiva of each orbit; round the lower extremity of each duct it forms a slight circu- lar fold ; and posteriorly it is continuous with the mem- brane of the pharynx and Eustachian tubes ; this mem- brane adheres inseparably to the periosteum; it is villous, very vascular, soft and thick on the septum and turbi- nated bones; at the extremities of the latter it forms thick fleshy-looking folds or lips ; in the sinuses it is pale and thin ; it is constantly moistened with a mucous se- cretion ; mucous glands are not distinct in it ; the olfac- tory or first pair of nerves are distributed to it in the form of numerous plexuses, it is also supplied with branches from the ophthalmic and superior maxillary divisions of the fifth pair ; the first pair are generally believed to en- dow the membrane with the peculiar sensibility of smell- ing ; Magendie, however, has recently made some expe- riments to prove that the branches of the fifth pair are accessory to this function.

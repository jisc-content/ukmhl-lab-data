176 are the longest and the most arched, particularly those on the right side, the convexity of which is on a level with the fourth rib ; the convexity of those on the left side is on a level with the fifth or sixth rib. The central tendon of the diaphragm is of great transverse breadth, and is divided into three portions, an anterior, right and left ; the first is the largest, the last is the smallest; in regard to their relative size these divisions of the tendon are uncertain ; the posterior border of the tendon is notched for the insertion of the crura or appendices of the diaphragm ; the fibres of this tendon chiefly run in rays from behind, forwards and outwards ; they are crossed and interlaced, however, by several bands, which have an irregular direction ; this tendon is much stronger and larger in proportion in the old than in the young. Behind and below this tendon are the two crura or ap- pendices of the diaphragm; the right crus is longer and thicker than the left, and arises by tendinous bands from the forepart of the bodies of the four first lumbar vertebrm. The left is smaller, and on a plane posterior to the right; it arises from the sides of the two or three first lumbar vertebrae ; the fibres of each crus ascend obliquely forwards, are connected to each other by a semilunar tendinous band extended across the aorta ; they then become fleshy, and a small fasciculus is sent from each crus to join the opposite ; these decussating fasciculi separate the oesophageal from the aortic open- ing in the diaphragm ; of these fasciculi, that from the right crus is always the larger, and that from the left is generally, but not always anterior. Each crus then ascends, and is inserted into the posterior border of the cordiform tendon. The right crus of the diaphragm is covered by the vena cava, renal capsule, semilunar ganglion, and by the liver ; the left crus by the aorta, left renal capsule, semilunar ganglion, spleen and sto- mach. To the thoracic surface of this muscle the pleurae are attached laterally, and the pericardium and mediastina along the middle. Three large openings are observed in the diaphragm; one for the aorta, one for the vena cava, and one for the oesophagus. Tlie aortic opening is rather a tendinous passage, behind and between the crura of the diaphragm ; it opens into

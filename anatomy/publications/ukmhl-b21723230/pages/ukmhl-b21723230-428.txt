410 ossific points, there are frequently accessory points or epiphyses found in the processes, as well as on the sur- faces of the body. These are the general characters gf all the vertebrae, but each of the three classes presents some peculiarity. The Lumbar Vertebrae are five ; these are the largest in the column ; the body of each is very broad trans- versely, compared Avith its height; its upper and lower surfaces are flat, and bordered with hard projecting edges, which render it concave from above downwards on its fore-part. The laminae are thick, broad, but short; the notches, particularly the lower, are very large ; the spi- nous process is broad, flat, and square, and ends not in a point, but in a thick rough border; the articulating pro- cesses are oval, strong, and vertical; the superior are con- cave and look inw'ards; the inferior are convex and look outAV'ards ; the transverse jnocesses are long, thin, and horizontal, and more anterior than those of the dorsal ver- tebrae ; the spinal foramen is triangular, and larger than in the back ; the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra is cut off obliquely below, so as to be much thicker before than behind ; its transverse processes are short, strong, and rounded. The dorsal vertebrae are twelve in number, and of an intermediate size between the cervical and lumbar; they decrease from the first to the fourth, and then increase to the last, so that the fourth and fifth are the smallest. The body is thicker behind than before, and longer from before backwards than transversely, flat above and below, and round, except in the first, Avhose surfaces are heart shaped, and very convex anteriorly; on either side it pre- sents two small depressions or notches, covered with car- tilage ; the superior is the larger; when the vertebrae are conjoined tw'o of these notches form an oval depression for the head of each rib ; the laminae are broad and thick ; the notches are large and anterior to the oblique processes; the transverse processes are long and large, and directed backwards ; on the front of each near the end, except of the two last, there is a small depression covered with car- tilage for articulating with the tubercle of the rib ; the oblique processes are vertical, the superior directed back- Avards, the inferior forwards; the spinal hole or canal is

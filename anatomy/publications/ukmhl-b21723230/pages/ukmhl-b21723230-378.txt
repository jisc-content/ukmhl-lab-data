S60 rior to the masseter muscle, and then ascends obliquely forwards and inwards towards the side of the nose ; in the neck it gives off, 1st, inferior palatine,^v;hich. as- ' cends along the side of the pharynx, and supplies the and the amygdala. ;j^he branch to the latter often arises distinctly ; 2nd, glandular to the submaxillary and adjoining lymphatic glands ; 3rd, submental runs ^ along the mylo-hyoid muscle to the chin, and^upplies i the surrounding muscles. On the face it gives^ft, 4th, in- ferior labial to the muscles and integuments between the lip and the chin ; 5th, the inferior and superior co- ronary, these run along the border of the lips close to the mucous membrane and directly join those from the opposite side ; 6th, lateralis nasi to the muscles and skin on the side and dorsum of the nose ; and 7th, angu- laris, which communicates with the ophthalmic. The muscular artery descends obliquely backwards, divides into several branches, which are principally dis- tributed to the sterno-mastoid muscle and to the surround- ing cellular tissue and glands. The occipital artery arises opposite the labial, as- cends obliquely backwards behind the digastric, then curves horizontally backwards between the' mastoid process and the atlas, and near the mesial line it ascends on the occiput ; it gives off several muscular branches, some to the mastoid and trapezius muscles, several to the deep muscles on the side and back of the neck, and on the occiput it divides into tortuous branches, which ascend in difi'erent directions in the scalp, and inosculate with the different arteries in that region. The posterior auricular artery arises above, often in common with the occipital ; it ascends behind the parotid and between the meatus auditorius and the mastoid process it divides into several branch'es which are lost in the integuments of the ear and in the scalp. The inferior or ascending pharyngeal artery arises near the division of the common carotid, ascends ver- tically to the base of the skull, and sends off several pharyngeal and palatine branches, and ends in a small

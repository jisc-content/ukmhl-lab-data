15 of the jaw: the lower extremity of this muscle is super- ficial, and lies between the parotid and submaxillary glands. Pteuygoideus Externus is short and triangular, placed at the lower part of the temporal fossa, arises broad and fleshy from the outer side of the external pterygoid plate, from the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid, and from the back part of the tuberosity of the superior maxilla; the fibres pass outwards and back- wards, nearly horizontal and converging, are inserted tendinous into the anterior and internal part of the neck of the lower jaw, and of the inter articular cartilage. Use, to draw' forward the jaw and interarticular carti- lage ; if only one act, it will turn the jaw to the opjx)- site side, so as to triturate or grind the food. These muscles are the chief agents in producing dislocation Of the jaw; when the mouth is widely opened their spas- modic action may suddenly draw the condyles forwards oflf the tubercles into the zygomatic fossae. The exter- nal pter^â€™goid muscle lies in a transverse direction be- neath the base of the cranium, and much further from the surface than the internal pterygoid, superior to which it lies; it is internal, and inferior to the temporal mus- cle, and is also concealed by the masseter. ils the ex- ternal and internal pterygoid muscles arise so near each other, and thence pass in different directions to their in- sertion, the external going transversely, and the internal descending, they leave between them a triangular space, which contains a quantity of fat, a small portion of the parotid gland, the internal maxillary artery and vein, and the dental and gustatory branches of the inferior max- illary nen'e.

431 it is developed from one point of ossification, which is in the parietal prominence; it is joined to five bones, viz. the frontal, sphenoid, temporal, occipital, and to its fellow. Tlie Occipital Bone is curved and of a rhomboidal figure, placed at the posterior and inferior part of the cranium ; it presents two surfaces, the external or pos- terior, or basilar, is convex, smooth above, presents near the centre the great protuberance to w'hich the cervical ligament is connected; from each side of this leads the superior transverse ridge to which the occi- pito-frontalis, trapezius and complexus muscles are at- tached ; midway between this and the foramen magnum, is tlie inferior transverse ridge, to which the splenii, recti majores and obliqui superiores are attached ; from the tuberosity a spine leads down vertically in the me- dian line as far as the foramen magnum; this latter is of an oval figure, and transmits the medulla spinalis, the vertebral vessels, and the suboccipital nerves; it is larger internally than externally ; in front of this is the basilar process, which is very thick and strong, it passes forwards and a little upwards into the base of the skull to join the sphenoid hone; its sides are rough and contiguous to the petrous bones ; it is also rough infe- riorly, for the attachment of muscles and the mucous membrane of the pharynx ; near the fore-part of the foramen are the condyles, smooth and oblong, covered with cartilage, looking downwards, outwards, and back- wards ; their anterior and inner edges are the deepest, their long axis is from before backwards, in which di- rection, as also from side to side, they are convex; they are uneven internally near their centre, for the insertion of the lateral ligaments from the odontoid process; they are articulated to the atlas; behind these is a fossa in which there is generally a small foramen through which a vein and small artery pass, and before them is ano- ther fossa in which there is always a foramen for the ninth pair of nerves ; external to each condyle is the jugular eminence, semilunar, bounding posteriorly the foramen lacerum, and giving attachment to the rectus lateralis muscle. The upper angle is acute ; the edges very irregular, as also along the sides, ossa triquetra are

248’ toes and rotate the anterior part of the foot outwards. This muscle is partly concealed by the tendons of the long extensor and peronaeus tertius; it projects, how- ever, behind and between them; the tendons cross the metatarsal bones and the interossei muscles, beneath and in a contrary direction to the long extensor ten- dons. The muscles on the outer part of the leg are the two peronaei. PeronjEus Long us, arises tendinous and fleshy around the head of the fibula, and from the adjacent surface of the tibia, from the upper half of the exter- nal angle of the fibula, from the fascia and inter-muscu- lar septa, the fibres descend obliquely backwards and outwards, end in a strong, flat tendon, which passes behind the external malleolus, through a groove in the lower end of the fibula, in which it is bound down by a strong aponeurosis, lined by a synovial membrane; it then passes forwards, downwards, and inwards, through a similar groove in the os calcis and cuboid; it next passes across the sole of the foot» obliquely in- wards and forwards towards the metatarsal bone of the great toe, into the outer side of which, and of the adjacent sesamoid bone, it is inserted; also, into the internal cuneiform, and into the base of the second metatarsal bone. Use, to extend the ankle joint, turn the foot outwards, and raise its outer edge fjcrm the ground ; in the leg this muscle is superficial, and is si- tuated between the extensor communis anteriorly and the solaeus and flexor polltcis posteriorly; in the sole of the foot it is above all the muscles there, and cannot be seen until these are removed. PEXiONiEUS Brevis, arises fleshy from the outer and back part of the lower half of the fibula, and from the intermuscular septa ; the fibres descend obliquely, end in a tendon which passes behind the external malleolus in the same groove as the peronaeus longus; it then passes forwards through a distinct groove in the os cal- cis above the peronaeus longus, and is inserted into the base of the n\etatarsal bone of the little toe, and into the os cuboides. Use, similar to the last. This muscle arises between the extensor longus and peronaeus Ion-

270 and occipital bones, and ends in the lateral sinus near its termination. The transverse sinus leads from one in- terior petrosal sinus to the other, across the cuneiform process of the occipital bone. The occipital sinuses are two small canals contained in the falx cerebelli; they re- ceive veins from the cerebellum, and sometimes from the vertebral canal, and open into the torcular Herophili; these sinuses sometimes extend along each side of the foramen magnum, and communicate with the lateral sinuses ; the occipital sinuses are often wanting. The torculi Herophili is a sort of common reseiroir in which several sinuses end ; it is situated opposite the tuberosity of the occipital bone, and enclosed between the layers of the falx and tentorium ; it is somewhat oval, and presents six openings, viz. the lateral sinus on each side; the lon- gitudinal sinus above, the straight sinus before, and the occipital sinuses below. The second covering of the brain is a serous membrane, the arachnoid, so fine and delicate that in some situa- tions it is difficult to demonstrate it; between the convo- lutions of the brain it can be raised from the pia mater, which sinks into the fissures between these ; and a little air forced between these membranes will separate them for some distance, and wdll raise the arachnoid membrane in a vesicular form ; on the base of the brain, and in the spinal canal, it is stronger, and can be distinctly detached from the subjacent membrane. The arachnoid membrane covers the whole surface of the brain, and is thence re- flected to the dura mater, which it lines throughout, ex- cept at the sella turcica, where the pituitary gland inter- venes between these membranes ; from the surface of the brain it is reflected on the dura mater in several situa- tions, viz. superiorly, as the veins enter the longitudinal sinus, this membrane accompanies them from the brain to the sinus, it is then reflected to the inner surface of the dura mater : inferiorly, also, it surrounds the nerves in their course from the brain to the foramina, through which they pass, and is then reflected on the dura mater, the latter membrane being really perforated and continued for a short distance around each nerve, whereas the arachnoid membrane forms a cul de sac

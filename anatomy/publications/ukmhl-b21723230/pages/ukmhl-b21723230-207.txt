ISO g;ular ligament and the adipose substance of which we have spoken: the pelvic surface of this muscle is co- vered by theâ€™peritonaeum and by the pelvic fascia, which cannot be seen in the present dissection, but which shall be noticed presently. At the anterior edge of each levator ani muscle fleshy fibres may be observed to sur- round the membranous part of the urethra very closely. These fibres, particularly at their insertion, will in ge- neral be found so united to the levatores ani, that they may be considered as a portion of these muscles ; they have, however, been described by Mr. Wilson as a pair of distinct muscles, under the following names, and to the following effect: Compressor Urethra, arises, by a tendon from the inside of the symphysis pubis, about one-eighth of an inch above the lower edge of the arch, and at nearly the same distance beneath the anterior ligaments of the bladder, to which, and to the tendon of the oppo- site muscle, it is connected by loose cellular membrane ; the tendon is at first round, but becomes flat as it de- scends, and is parallel to and in contact with its fellow; it then ends in fleshy fibres, which increase in breadth, and which, approaching the upper surface of the mem- branous portion of the urethra, separate from those of the opposite muscle, descend along the side of the mem- branous portion of the urethra, and folding beneath it, again approach the muscle of the opposite side, and are inserted with it into a narrow tendinous line, which be- comes lost in the common central point of the perinaeum. Use, to compress, contract, close, and elevate the mem- branous portion of the urethra ; these fibres encircle the naiTowest part of the urethra, that portion which is just behind the bulb, and may, by their contraction during life, form such an impediment to the passage of an in- strument into the bladder, as may lead the surgeon to suspect the presence of a stricture, when in reality no alteration of structure exists. The origin of these mus- cles is occasionally distinguished from the levatores ani, by some small veins which pass from the side of the neck of the bladder to join the trunk of the dorsal veins of the penis, but their insertion is confounded with these muscles in perinwo behind the bulb.

408 temporal, two parietal, the occipital, the ethmoid and the sphenoid bones; to these may be added the small turbinated bones of the sphenoid or of Bertin, and the four auricular bones in each temporal bone, which have been already described in the anatomy of the ear. The face is divided into the upper and lower jaw; the u'pâ€™per consists of the two superior maxillary, two pala- tine, tw'o lachrymal, two nasal, two malar, two inferior turbinated bones and the vomer; to these may be added the sixteen teeth. The lower jaw consists of the infe- rior maxillary bone, which contains sixteen teeth ; some consider the os hyoides as an appendix to the bones of the face ; this bone however has been already noticed in the description of the larynx. The pelvis is the lower extremity of the trunk; it consists of the sacrum, the coccyx, and the two ossa in- nominata. The superior or thoracic extremities are composed each of four parts, the shoulder, which consists of the clavicle and scapula; the arm, of the humerus; the fore-arm of the radius and ulna; and the hand, which is "subdivided into the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers. The carpus consists of eight small bones; the metacar- pus of five, and the fingers each of three phalanges ex- cept the thumb, which has only two. The inferior or abdominal extremities are each divided into three parts ; the thigh, which consists of but one bone, the femur ; the leg, which consists of three, the patella, tibia, and fibula; and the foot, which is di- vided into three parts, the tarsus, metatarsus, and toes ; tlie tarsus consists of seven irregular bones, the meta- tarsus of five long bones, and the toes of the three pha- langes each, except the great toe, which has only two. Jn the adult skeleton the number of bones amount to 242, including the bones of the ear and the teeth, but excluding the os hyoides and the sesamoid bones. THE VERTEBRAE. Til E Vertebrae are twenty-four in number, they belong to the class of irregular bones, are placed one above the other, and connected by ligaments so as to form one

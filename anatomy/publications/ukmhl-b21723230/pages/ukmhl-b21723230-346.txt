328 torum longus; to these and to the short peronsei muscles it sends several muscular branches ; about the middle of the leg it perforates the fascia, and a little above the outer maleolus it divides into the internal and external tarsal nerves or dorsal nerves of the foot; the internal is distributed to the integuments of the first and second toes, and communicates with the internal saphenus nerve and with the anterior tibial ; the external supplies the inte- guments on the three outer toes, and communicates with the internal branch and with the external saphenus nerve. The anterior tibial nerve descends obliquely forwards along with' the anterior tibial artery, between the tibialis anticus and the extensor digitorum longus and extensor pollicis, which muscles it supplies; it also sends branches through the fascia to the integuments; it then passes be- neath the annular ligament of the tarsus, and runs to the interosseous muscle between two first metatarsal bones ; on the foot it sends a large branch to the extensor digi- tonim brevis, also several cutaneous and communicating filaments, and it terminates by supplying the first inter- osseal muscle and the integuments of the two internal toes ; in the first interosseal space a small branch commu- nicates with the plantar nerves. The internal popliteal or posterior tibial nerve is larger than the preceding; it descends nearly vertically between the heads of the gas- trocnemius and solaeus muscles, and behind the articula- tion of the knee and the poplitseus muscle; it then descends obliquely inwards beneath the solaeus and on the tibialis posticus and flexor digitorum longus, to the arch beneath the heel and the internal ankle ; it here divides into the internal and external plantar nerves. In the ham a quantity of fat separates this nersm from the popliteal vessels; below the knee it becomes more closely con- nected to them, lying superficial and a little to their in- ner or tibial side ; at the lowâ€™er edge of the poplitaeus it passes to the outer or fibular side of the posterior tibial artery, and descends in that relation to this vessel as far as the internal malleolar region. The posterior tibial nerve above the knee gives off a small nerve, the poste- rior or external saphenus; this descends along the back of the leg, at first covered by the fascia, afterwards

265 some of these accompany the vessels and nerves, and are gradually lost on them, others become continuous with the periosteum ; the most remarkable of these processes, next to that which is continued along the spinal canal, is one which passes through the foramen lacerum orbitale, and joins the periosteum in the orbit, and another, which surrounds the optic nerve, and is united to the sclerotic coat of the eye. Several small arteries ramify on this membrane, between it and the bones of the cranium ; an- teriorly these are derived from the ophthalmic and inter- nal carotid vessels ; the middle artery of the dura mater is the largest, this is a branch of the internal maxillary, it enters the base of the cranium, through the spinous hole in the sphenoid bone, passes forwards and upwards above the temporal and sphenoid bones, then ascends ob- liquely backwards on the inner surface of the parietal bone, the anterior and inferior angle of which it grooves very deeply ; posteriorly the dura mater receives several small arteries, viz. branches from the occipital, pharyn- geal, and vertebral arteries; these vessels of the dura mater also supply the superincumbent bones with blood. Cut through this membrane parallel to the edge of the cranium, raise it from each side of tile brain towards the vertex, leaving a small portion of it in the mesial line, both before and behind undivided ; the internal surface is now seen to be smooth and polished, and moistened with a fine serous exhalation : this surface is the reflected or the parietal layer of the arachnoid membrane (to be ex- amined presently,) it adheres so closely to the dura mater that it is difficult to .separate them for any extent, unless previously macerated. From the internal surface of the dura mater, folds or processes extend into the cranium, which divide this cavity into several compartments, and support and se- parate different portions of the brain ; these processes are the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli and falx cere- belli. The falx cerebri is exposed by gently separating one hemisphere of the brain from the other ; it com- mences narrow at the crista galli and middle ridge of the ethmoid bone, thence it ascends in the median line, and passing backwards, ends by being continued into N

312 the spinal accessory, glosso-pharj'ngeal, lingual, and sympathetic nerves ; to all these it is closely connected, and the nerve here has the compact appearance, and sometimes the greyish tint of a ganglion ; at first it is placed anterior to the vein and to the lingual nerve ; it soon, however, passes behind both and opposite the atlas, the vein separates it from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve which lies anterior to that vessel; the vagus then descends along the fore-part of the neck enclosed in the sheath of the carotid artery and jugular vein : in this sheath it is placed between these vessels, rather behind and more closely connected to the vein ; on the right side this nerve enters the thorax between the subclavian vein and arte- ry, crossing the latter at right angles; on the left side it is also anterior but nearly parallel to the subclavian arte- ry, a little below which it crosses obliquely the back part of the arch of the aorta : in the thorax these nerv'es de- scend at first obliquely backwards behind the roots of the lungs and enter the posterior mediastinum, they then descend along the oesophagus through the diaphragm and terminate on the stomach. Each pneumo-gastric nerve gives off the following branches ; they may be divided into cervical, thoracic, and abdominal; the cervical branches are, the pharyngeal, superior laryngeal, cardiac and recurrent or inferior laryngeal. First, the pharyn- geal nerve arises from the vagus near the base of the cra- nium, and soon receives a twig from the spinal accessor)-; it descends obliquely inwards behind the carotid artery to the side of the pharynx, divides into several branches, which communicate with those from the glosso-pfiar)m- geal, laryngeal, and sympathetic; all these branches form the pharyngeal plexus ; this plexus extends along the side of the middle and upper constrictor, and sends nu- merous filaments to each of these muscle,s, and to the mucous membrane of the phar)'nx and fauces. Second, the superior laryngeal nerve arises a little below the last ; it runs in an arched manner downwards and for- wards behind the internal carotid artery, and below the superior cervical ganglion, wdth which it communicates, as also with the lingual nerve; it sends several fila- ments to the pharyngeal plexus and then divides into

249 gu3, and descends between the peronaeus tertius and the flexor pollicis longus, and partly concealed by the pe- ronjeus longus; it continues fleshy lower down than it, and projects on either side of its tendon ; it is separated from the peronseus tertius by the external malleolus; in the groove in the latter it is beneath the long pero- naeal tendon, that is nearer to the bone, but on the os calcis it is superior to it; an aponeurosis sometimes unites its insertion to that of the extensor tendon of the little toe. In the dissection of the foregoing muscles we meet with the anterior tibial vessels and their branches; also the peronaeal nerve and its divisions. The anterior tibial artery is a branch of the popliteal; it passes forwards between the solaeus and poplitaeus, perforates the interosseous space surrounded by some fibres of the tibialis posticus; it then descends obliquely in- wards and forwards as far as the cleft between the first and second metatarsal bones; in its course down the leg it is placed at first between the tibialis anticus and extensor communis, in the middle of the leg, between the former and the extensor pollicis, and inferiorly be- tween the tendon of the latter and that of the extensor communis; above it lies on the interosseous membrane, below it passes over the tibia, the synovial membrane of the ankle joint, the astragalus, navicular and cunei- form bones, and beneath the annular ligament and the internal tendon of the extensor digitorum brevis; in the leg the anterior tibial artery sends off, first, the recurrent branch, which ascends on the outer and fore- part of the head of the tibia, and meets the external articular arteries; second, in its course along the leg, several muscular branches; third, near the ankle, the two malleolar branches, of these, the external Is the larger and inosculates with a small artery (the anterior peronceal) which perforates the interosseous ligament about two inches above the ankle joint; on the tarsus, the anterior tibial artery sends oflF the tarsal and meta- tarsal branches, which pass obliquely outwards, and supply tlie interossei muscles, the bones and joints of the tarsus and metatarsus; between the two first me- tatarsal bones the anterior tibial divides into the supe- M 3

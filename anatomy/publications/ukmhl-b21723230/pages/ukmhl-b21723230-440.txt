422 4 part of the acetabulum, it gives attachment to one head of the rectus femoris muscle; the notch between these two spinous processes is filled by the sartorius and iliacus muscles; internal to the inferior spine is a superficial groove along which the psoas and iliac muscles pass; this groove is bounded internally by the ilio-pectinaeal eminence, which is common to the ilium and pubis; fourth, the ■posterior superior spine is the posterior ter- mination of the crest, below which is a notch ; and fifth, the posterior inferior spine ; these two processes give attachment to ligaments and muscles; beneath the infe- rior is the commencement of the sacro-sciatic notch. The Ischium is placed at the lower, outer, and back part of the pelvis, and presents a body and processes; the bod'y forms the outer and back part of the aceta- bulum, more than two-fifths of which it forms, and pre- sents a prominent line or border; beneath this is a hori- zontal groove, which lodges the tendon of the obturator externus, and from this a rough ridge leads down to the tuber of the bone and gives attachment to the quadratus femoris muscle ; the anterior part is thin and sharp, and bounds the thyroid hole; the posterior part joins the ilium, and bounds the sacro-sciatic notch. The pro- cesses are, first the spine, which arises from its posterior part just below the notch; it projects backwards and inwards, gives attachment to the superior gemellus and the lesser sciatic ligament, and bounds the great scia- tic notch inferiorly; below the spinous process, betw’een it and the following is the smooth pulley round w'hich the tendon of the obturator internus muscle turns; 2d, the tuberosity is beneath this pulley and the lesser sacro-sciatic notch, on this process the body rests in the sitting posture, it is broad behind and covered with cartilage, it gives attachment to the adductor magnus and to the hamstring muscles ; on its internal side is a groove for the tendon of the obturator externus; 3d, the ramus ascends from the tuber forwards and inwards, and joins that of the pubis: it is thin and flat, one border is thin and bounds the thyroid hole, the other is thick and in part bounds the lower aperture of the pelvis ; to it are attached the crus penis, and the compressor penis muscle.

168 \ six branches, which enter tlie foramina in the concave surface of the spleen: from these splenic branches five or six small arteries, the vasa brevia, pass to the left or great end of the stomach. The superior mesenteric ar- tery arises about half an inch below the coeliac axis, be- hind the pancreas; it descends in front of the duode- num, enters the mesentery, and bends obliquely towards the right iliac fossa; from its left or convex side it sends off sixteen or eighteen branches, which supply the jeju- num and the ileum, and from its concave or right side arise three branches, the ileo-colica, colica dextra, and colica media; these arteries supply the corresponding portions of the colon. The inferior mesenteric artery arises a little above the division of the aorta into the iliac vessels; it descends to the left side, and divides into three branches. 1st, The colica sinistra, which supplies the left lumbar colon, and inosculates with the colica media; 2d, the sigmoid artery, which supplies the sigmoid flexure of the colon; and 3d, the superior haemorrhoidal, which is distributed to the rectum.â€” These arteries are accompanied by corresponding veins, which all unite to form the vena porta; the inferior mesenteric vein accompanies the artery of that name to the aorta, and there joins the superior mesenteric vein, which is a very considerable vessel; this common trunk then ascends behind the pancreas, and is joined by a very large vein from the spleen; the confluence of the splenic and mesenteric veins forms the commencement of the vena porta; this vessel ascends obliquely to the right side, surrounded by nerves and cellular membrane, and enclosed in the lesser omentum: near the trans- verse Assure it becomes dilated (the sinus of the porta) and then divides into the right and left branches; the former is the larger, the latter the longer of the two; each branches out through the liver, surrounded by the capsule of Glisson, and runs in a transverse direction: injection shews their minute branches to communicate in the acini with the pori biliarii, or with the commence- ments of the hepatic ducts. The nerves which supply the digestive organs are the eighth pair, and the splanchnic branches, from the sympathetic; the eighth pair descend along the oesopha-

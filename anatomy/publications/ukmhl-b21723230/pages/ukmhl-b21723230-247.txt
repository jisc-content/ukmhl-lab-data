229 to the inner side of the knee ; it there becomes cuta- neous, and attaching itself to the saphena vein, it ac- companies this vessel along the inner side of the leg to the internal ankle. (See Anatomy of the Nervous System.) SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE THIGH. Place the detached extremity on its fore-part, Avith a block beneath the hip joint, so as to flex the latter slightly, and thus extend the muscles in this region. Raise the integuments from the posterior surface of the limb, from the crest of the ilium to the calf of the leg ; the cutaneous nerves which are met with in this dissec- tion, are branches from the lumbar nerves, from the sacral plexus, and from the sciatic nerve. The cuta- neous veins pass in different directions, some turn round the inner side of the limb to the saphena vein, others pe- netrate between the muscles and join the deep veins which accompany the muscular or the perforating arteries, and others descend to the popliteal space, and join the popli- teal or the lesser saphena vein. The fascia lata over the glutaeus maximus is weak, but anterior to that muscle, that is, covering the glutaeus medius, it is A'eiy strong, and adheres to the surface of this muscle, and to the crest of the ilium above it; on the posterior part of the thigh, the fascia is not so dense as on the outer or ant^jpr part; inferiorly, over the popliteal region, or the ham, it is much stronger than above; from the thigh it is continued over the muscles of the leg, in which situation it may be examined afterwards: the fascia and integuments be- ing removed, the muscles should be cleanly dissected ; these may be divided into the muscles of the hip and of the thigh.

234. ^ment, the fibres run parallel to the former, and are also inserted into the digital fossa. Use, to rotate the thigh outwards, also to abduct it, to strengthen the capsular ligament and to confine the obturator tendon in its o'»ua- tion. These muscles are concealed by the glutaeus maxi- mus and the sciatic nerve ; they are placed between the pyriformis and the quadratus femoris muscles ; they form a sort of sheath around the tendon of the obturator inter- nus, and adhere to its edges ; they appear as portions of this muscle added to it as it escapes from the pelvis ; the inferior is the larger of the two ; the superior is inserted between the pyriformis and the obturator intemus, and the inferior between the tendons of the obturator inter- nus and extemus: they both adhere to the capsular liga- ment. Obturator Irternus, is situated partly within the pelvis and partly behind the ilio-femoral articulation; somewhat triangular, the base within the pelvis, the apex at the great trochanter, arises by aponeurotic and fleshy fibres within the pelvis, from the superior or pelvic surface of the obturator or thyroid ligament, and from all the cir- cumference of the foramen of that name, except at the upper part where the obturator nerve and vessels pass through ; beneath these a ligamentous arch is extended, and from this some fibres of this muscle proceed ; it also arises from the pubis internally, and from the ischium inferiorly, and from a thin but strong fascia of the same name, which covers this muscle and separates it from the levator ani muscle ; the fibres descend obliquely outwards and backwards, converging towards the lesser sciatic notch, which is bet«.een the spine and the tuberosity of the ischium ; the fibres here end in a flat tendon, which turning outwards, winds round the cartilaginous pully- like surface which the ischium here presents, a loose bursa, and one, in general, containing a quantity of sy- novia, is here interposed between this tendon and the bone ; the tendon now runs outwards on the dorsum of the pelvis, between the gemini muscles, and is inserted into the digital fossa of the great trochanter. Use, to abduct and rotate the thigh outwards ; it may also act on the capsular ligament. This muscle within the pelvis

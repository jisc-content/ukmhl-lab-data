195 former, and is inserted inferiorly into the great sciatic ligament, into the tuber ischii, and into the rami of the ischium and pubis, where it is continuous with the triangular ligament of the urethra, which ligament thus appears to be the continuation of the obturator fascia, from one side of the pelvis to the other. The vesical fascia covers and adheres to the internal surface of the levator ani, lying between it and the peritonaeum ; this fascia descends anteriorly to the lower edge of the sym- physis pubis, and laterally to a level with a line carried from this point round to the spine of the ischium ; from the pubis it is reflected on the upper surface of the pros- tate gland, and on the neck of the bladder, forming the anterior true ligaments of this organ ; laterally it is re- flected from the pelvis on the side of the prostate, and on the lower part of the side of the bladder, just above the outer edge of each vesicula seminalis, and thus it forms the true lateral ligaments of the bladder ; poste- riorly the vesical fascia becomes thin and cellular, is at- tached to the side of the rectum, and lost on the nerves and vessels passing into and out of the pelvis. The vesical fascia thus forms a pouch on each side of the bladder, which assists in closing the pelvis ; it also fixes the pelvic viscera, supports the peritonaeum, and resists the pressure of the abdominal muscles and dia- phragm. This fascia is perforated by several blood- vessels. The anterior ligaments of the bladder are two in num- ber ; they arise, each, from the lower margin of the pu- bis by the side of the symphysis ; pass backwards and upwards on the upper surface of the prostate gland, and expand on the anterior part of the bladder ; many of their fibres may be seen to become continuous with the mus- cular fibres of the bladder. A depression exists between these two ligaments, along which the dorsal veins of the penis pass from beneath the arch of the pubes to the side of the bladder in tbeir course to the internal iliac veins, m which they terminate; the pelvic fascia, however, is not deficient between these ligaments, but is continued from one to the other, so as to line this depression and cover the superior surface of these veins. The true la- teral ligaments of the bladder are, one on each side; k2

201 in the scrotum communicated with the general cavity of the peritonjEum by a sort of canal which led along the fore-part of the cord from the abdomen to the scrotum : this canal, however, about the period of birth, was closed by adhesive inflammation, and ever afterwards the cavity of the "tunica vaginalis is quite distinct from that of the peritonaeum. The tunica vaginalis, therefore, is a se- rous membrane, a shut sac, suspending, and partly en- closing the testicle, and also reflected over its anterior part and sides: that portion of it which suspends the gland, and which lines the scrotum, may be named the tunica vaginalis scroti; while the reflected portion which covers the sides and fore-part of the testicle is the tu- nica vaginalis testis. This membrane is so loosely con- nected to the scrotum that it can be detached from it with little force ; it is thence reflected on the side and fore-part of the epididymis and testis ; it also ascends a short distance on the fore-part of the cord; the posterior jrart of the epididymis is altogether uncovered by it : as it is continued from the epididymis to the testicle it passes in between these organs, particidarly on their outer side, so as to form a sort of pouch between them. Both the testicle and epididjunis are in reality behind this serous membrane, and nothing is contained within its cavity e.xcept the serous fluid, which lubricates its opposed sur- faces, and which facilitates that gliding motion which tlie testicle undergoes in the scrotum. When the an- terior part of the tunica vaginalis is divided, we see its in- ternal surface smooth and polished, and shining through its reflected layer which cos'ers the testis, we can dis- cern the next tunic of this gland, tunica albuginea: this is a dense fibrous membrane ; it forms the proper capsule of the gland, adheres to it, preserves its pe- culiar form, and sends several processes or septa into the testicle, which will be seen when the body of the latter shall have been opened ; it has no connexion to the epididymis : it is difficult to dissect off the re- flected layer of the serous membrane, or the tunica vaginalis testis from the tunica albuginea, they are so intimately united ; through the latter several blood- vessels can be distinctly seen. Each testicle is of an k.3

18 branches ; the most of these pass obliquely downwards, and communicate freely with branches of the 7th pair. Through the mental foramen the mental nerve escapes : this is a branch of the inferior maxillar}% or third divi- sion of the 5th pair; most of its branches ascend to the muscles of the lower lip, and several communicate with the portio dura.â€”(For the more particular description of the nen^es of the face, see the Anatomy of the Ner- vous System.) The mouth, fauces, and palate, are the parts of the face next in order to be examined; but as these are connected and continuous with the pharjmx, and as this organ cannot be seen until the muscles of the neck have been removed, the student had better postpone the dissection of tlie former until he has become ac- quainted with the anatomy of the latter; we shall there- fore proceed next to the dissection of the neck. CHAP. II. DISSECTION OF THE NECK. SECTION I. OF THE MUSCLES. Raise the- shoulders of the subject by blocks placed beneath them, so as to make tense the muscles in this region; divide the integuments near to, and in a line with the clavicle, also along the side of the jaw from the chin to the mastoid process; connect these incisions by another made in a perpendicular direction, in the middle line from the chin to the sternum; dissect off the integuments from before backwards, in an oblique direction, from the chin towards the clavicle; this should be done cautiously, to avoid injuring the platys- ma or fascia. The platysma myoides will be now fully exposed, and the sterno-mastoid and hyoid muscles

303 Sixth or Akducens Nerve, after traversing the cavernous sinus (where it is joined by branches from the sympathetic nerve) on the outer side of the carotid artery, enters the orbit through the lower part of the foramen lacerum between the origins of the external rectus beneath the other orbital nerves and above the ophthalmic vein ; it then passes forwards and outwards, and is distributed to the ocular surface of the external rectus muscle. The different nerves in the orbit have different offices to perform, viz. the second pair is for vision, the third, fourth, and sixth pairs are for supply- ing muscles, and the ophthalmic nerve is for communi- cating sensation to the parts within and without the orbit. The student should next examine the lenticular or ophthalmic ganglion ; this small body is situated near the back part of the orbit between the optic nerve and the external rectus muscle; it is of a reddish co- lour and surrounded by soft fat; its posterior superior angle receives the filament before mentioned from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and its posterior infe- rior angle receives the twig from the inferior oblique branch of the third pair ; these two nerves are described by some as forming this ganglion; from the anterior angles of this ganglion two fasciculi of fine nerves pro* ceed, termed the ciliary; the inferior fasciculus is larger than the superior; the ciliaiy nerves are about twenty in number, eight or ten in the inferior fasciculus, about six in the superior, and three or four internally, which arise from the nasal nerve; the ciliary nerves twine along the surface of the optic nerve, accompanied by the ciliary arteries, and pierce the back part of the sclerotic coat, they then become flat, and proceed for- wards in parallel grooves on the inner surface of that membrane, with very little connexion to the choroid coat; at the anterior part of the eye they meet the ci- liary' ligament; in this substance most of these nerves are lost, hence some consider this as a ganglion; on each side, however, one or two branches may be traced through this into the iris, in which they divide into numerous filaments of extreme minutene.ss. The stu- dent should next proceed to examine the superior and inferior maxillary nerves, the remaining divisions of the

24 Sterko-Tiiyroideus is broader and shorter than the last, arises from the posterior surface of the ster- num and cartilage of the second rib, ascends obliquely outwards, and is inserted into the oblique line on the ala of the thyroid cartilage. Use, to depress the larjm.x. This muscle is covered by the stemo-mastoid and hyoid muscles, and by the skin; it conceals the vena innominata and carotid artery, the thyroid gland, and the trachea ; between it and the latter there is a consi- derable quantity of cellular membrane which contains several veins (inferior thyroid v.). Several filaments of the descendens noni nerve are distributed to this and to the former muscle. It is between the sterno-thvroid muscles that the operation of tracheotomy is performed, w'hile that of laryngotomy is between the sterno-hyoid muscles and betw'een the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. Omo-Hyoideus is long, slender, and digastric, arises broad and fleshy from the superior costa of the scapula behind its semilunar notch, from the ligament covering that notch, sometimes from the base of the coracoid process, and sometimes also from the acromial end of the clavicle; it ascends obliquely forwards a little above the clavicle, passes beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, where it is generally tendinous, except in the very young subject; becoming again flesby, it ascends nearly vertical along the outer side of the sterno- hyoid, and is inserted fleshy into the lower border of the os hyoides at the junction of its body and cornu. Use, (the muscle of one side cannot act in- dependent of the other,) both draw the os hyoides, phaiynx, and larynx, downwards and backwards, and in deglutition serve to urge the food into the oesophagus. The origin of this muscle is concealed by the trapezius; it lies anterior to the insertion of the levator anguli scapulae, and beiw'een the serratus magnus and supra- spinatus muscles: the posterior belly is covered only by the integuments and fascia, and divides the great posterior lateral triangle of the neck into an inferior and superior part, as w'as before mentioned; this por- tion of the omo-hyoid can frequently be distinguished in the living neck. The tendon crosses the carotid artery and jugular vein, and is covered by the sterno-

92 t Deltoides, very thick and strong, triangular, arises tendinous from the lower edge of the spine of the sca- pula, and rather fleshy from the anterior edge of the acromion, and of the external third of the clavicle; the fibres converge and descend obliquely, the posterior for- wards, the anterior backwards, and the middle at first outwards, and then vertically downwards ; inserted ten- dinous into a rough surface, about two inches in extent, situated on the outer side of the humerus, and com- mencing just above its centre. Use, to abduct and raise the arm, the anterior fibres can also draw it forwards, the posterior backwards, and when the arm is by the side, these portions can rotate it inwards or outwards. This muscle can also move the scapula on the arm when the latter is fixed, as in the case of a fall upon the hand or elbow, or in lifting a very heavy w'eight; under these circumstances this muscle sometimes co-operates with the great pectoral and latissimus dorsi, to dislocate the head of the humerus into the axilla. The deltoid is covered only by the skin, and a few fibres of the pla- tysma; its origin corresponds to the insertion of the tra- pezius, with which it i^ often connected by aponeurotic fibres; its insertion is surrounded by the origin of the brachiaeus anticus, and lies between the biceps and se- cond head of the triceps; its posterior margin is thin, and sends off an aponeurosis to cover the infra-spinatus mus- cle ; its anterior edge is separated from the great pecto- ral, by the cephalic vein, some cellular membrane, and a small artery. This muscle is fleshy on its external surface, coarse and rough, and composed of several dis- tinct triangular fasciculi. Divide it transversely, and reflect each portion, and we shall then see that its struc- ture is very complex, and that its internal surface is much more tendinous ; a large bursa also is seen beneath it; this bursa extends undefT,he acromion, and is ex- panded on the tendon of the supra-spinatus, and on the capsular ligament; it allows the deltoid muscle and the exterior of the shoulder joint to glide easily against each other; the deltoid also covers the coracoid process, the muscles which are attached to it, all the small muscles connected to the capsular ligament, the insertion of the great pectoral, and the circumfle.x vessels and nerve$.

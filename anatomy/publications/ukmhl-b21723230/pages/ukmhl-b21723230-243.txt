225 L 3 I near the knee, where it is covered by the sartorius ; its insertion is inferior to that of the sartorius, and supe- rior to that of the semi-tendinosus; the saphena vein and nen’e are situated between its tendon and that of the sartorius at the inner side of the knee, but these are se- parated from each other by a fascia, which attaches these tendons together, the vein lying superficial; from the tendon of the gracilis an aponeurosis is sent off to the fascia of the leg. PectiN/EUs, flat, triangular, broad above, situated at the superior, anterior, and internal part of the thigh ; arises fleshy from the linea innominata on the horizontal ramus of the pubis, between the spine of that bone and the ilio-pectinseal eminence; it forms a flat fleshy belly, which descends obliquely outwards and backwards, and is inserted by a flat tendon into the rough ridge which leads from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera. Use, to adduct and flex the thigh, also, to rotate it out- wai’ds; it may also serve to strengthen the capsular ligament of the hip joint internally, and in adduction of the limb to draw the capsule inwards from between the neck of the femur and the acetabulum. The pectinaeus lies between the psoas magnus and the adductor longus ; the latter overlaps it; it is covered superiorly by the fascia lata, and inferiorly by the femoral vessels; it covers the obturator nerve and vessels, the external ob- turator muscle, and the adductor brevis ; it also adheres to the capsular ligament of the hip joint. Triceps Adductor Femo'ris consists of three por- tions, which pass in distinct laminae from the pelvis to the thigh. Adductor Longus, flat and triangular, broad below, is situated at the upper and internal part of the thigh, superficial to the other adductors and to the pectinaeus ; it arises by a short, small, but strong tendon from the anterior surface of the pubis, between its spine and the symphysis; this ends in a broad fleshy belly, which de- scends obliquely backwards and outwards, and is in- serted by a broad thin tendon into the middle third of the linea aspera, between the adductor magnus and the vastus intemus, to both of which it is closely united. The origin of this muscle lies between the pectiiicens

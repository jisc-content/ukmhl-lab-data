321 nator quadratus it divides into two branches, one to supply that muscle, the other traverses the interosseous space, and is lost on the dorsum of the carpus and me- tacarpus; a little above the wrist, the median nerve gives oflF a superficial branch, which passes over the annular ligament, and is lost in the integuments; in the palm of the hand, the median nerve divides into five digital branches, the two first pass one along either side of the thumb, the third goes to the radial side of the index finger, the fourth supplies the opposed sides of the index and middle finger, and the fifth, which is joined by a small branch from the ulnar nerve, supplies the opposed sides of the middle and ring fingers; these digital branches in the palm of the hand are su- perficial to the tendons, and form an arch nearly parallel to that formed by the ulnai' artery, the brandies of the latter and the digital nerves then run together to the extremity of each finger; in this course they supply the lumbricales, the integuments of the hand and fingers, and near the last phalanx of each the nerves enlarge and become red and soft, and divide into numerous fine branches, which are lost in the papillae of the cutis. Ulnar nerve arises from the lower part of the plexus, descends obliquely backwards along the biceps, and behind the elbow joint, through the groove between the inner condyle and the olecranon process; it then passes forwards, and descends along the ulnar side of the fore-arm to the carpus, and passing over the an- nular ligament close to the pisiform form, ends in the palm of the hand, in two branches, a superficial and a deep. In the arm this nerve is superficial, and gives off a few branches to the triceps and to the skin; in the fore-arm it lies on the flexor profundus, and between the flexor sublimis and ulnaris; to these muscles, particu- larly the latter, it sends several filaments; a little above the wrist it gives off the dorsalis carpi ulnaris, a large branch which winds round the ulna to the back of the hand, aud divides into several long branches which are lost in the integuments of that region and of the three inner fingers. Of the terminating branches of the ulnar nerve, the superficial is the larger, it divides into p 3

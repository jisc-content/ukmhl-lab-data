155 num. In the duodenum, the chyme is mixed with the biliary and pancreatic fluids, and a separation takes place between the chyle and the excrementitious part of the food. jejunum and ileum intestines are covered by the omentum : if rve raise this process and the arch of the colon, and place them on the edge of the thorax, the con- volutions of these intestines will be seen in the umbilical, hypogastric, and iliac regions ; convex anteriorly, concave posteriorly, and attached to the mesentery; the jejunum commences in the left lumbar, and the ileum ends in the right iliac region. There is no exact division between these two intestines ; the upper two-fifths are named the jejunum, and are placed higher in the abdomen than the ileum, which is the name given to the three remain- ing fifths. The jejunum is redder, feels thicker, and is larger than the ileum, which is pale and thin : these dif- ferences are striking, when we compare the commence- ment of the jejunum with the terminating portion of the ileum; in the intermediate space, however, they are gTa- dually lost; the greater vascularity and number of valvulm conniventes in the jejunum than in the ileum account for these differences in these portions of the alimentary tube. The large intestine forms about one-fifth of the intes- tinal canal, and is subdivided into the caecum, colon, and rectum ; the large intestine differs from the small, not merely in size, but in having a peculiar cellular and sac- culated appearance, particularly when distended ; small processes also (the appendices epiploicae) are attached along its whole course ; three strong: muscular bands running in a longitudinal direction, may also be observed chiefly in the caecum and colon ; these appear to pucker the large intestine, so as to give it the cellular structure before mentioned : the large intestines are paler than the small, and much thinner, having but few valvulae conniventes. The ccecum, or caput coli, is situated in the right iliac fossa, in which region it is fixed by the peritonaeum, which in general covers it only anteriorly and laterally, the cellular membrane connecting it posteriorly to the iliac and psoas muscles ; in some, however, the poritomeum covers the caecum all round, and connects it to the iliac

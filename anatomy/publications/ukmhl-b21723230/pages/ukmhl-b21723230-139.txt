121 the linea alba a thick portion runs to the dorsum of the penis, invests this organ, and serves as a suspensory ligament to it. In the female it is loaded with fat in this situation, and descends into the labia. As this fascia passes over Poupart’s ligament, it is connected to it, through the medium of a thin but dense membrane, which ascends from the fascia lata of the thigh, and is soon lost on the abdominal muscles; to this the super- ficial fascia is attached, so as to give the latter the ap- pearance of adhering to Poupart’s ligament, although it really is not so. About an inch below this ligament, in the groin, the supeidicial adheres intimately to the fascia lata; in this situation the former is very thick and lami- nated, forming capsules for the inguinal lymphatic glands, and is connected to the fascia lata by vessels and nerves which perforate the latter in their course to and from these glands, the superficial fascia and inte- guments ; the fascia lata here also is very weak, and ra- ther cellular, so that the superficial and deep fasciae are continuous or identified in this situation ; soon after- wards, however, they become distinct. The superficial fascia is thinner along the sides than it is on the fore- part of the abdomen; its cutaneous surface is cellular, and closely connected to the integument; its posterior surface is more compact and smooth ; several blood ves- sels ramify between the skin and this membrane ; three set on each side, viz. the external circumflex ilii, exter- nal epigastric and external pudic arteries ; these all arise in the groin, from the femoral artery, or from some of its branches, and ascend over Poupart’s ligament ; the first ramifies towards the anterior spinous process of the ilium, the second, which is the largest of the three, ascends towards the umbilicus, and the third passes transversely towards the pubis; these several arteries supply the integuments, and inosculate with the deep seated vessels of the same names ; they are each accom- panied by one or two veins, which are often found re- markably tortuous. The superficial fascia supports and connects the fleshy and tendinous fasciculi of tlie ab- dominal muscles; it also possesses a good deal of elas- ticity, which assists these muscles in the contraction of the parietes of the abdomen.

373 merous branches, and inosculates with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery ; the right and left hepatic arteries then separate and plunge into the substance of the liver, accompanying the branches of the vena porta; the right hepatic is the larger, and before it enters the gland it gives off the cystic artery %vhich sup- plies the parietes of the gall-bladder ; 3rd, the splenic artery is the longest branch of the coeliac axis ; it passes backwards and to the left side along the upper edge of the pancreas, to which it sends several branches ; near the spleen it gives off the gastro-epiploica sinistra ; this bends forwards, and to the right side along the great cnn ature of the stomach, and between the laminae of the great omentum, it inosculates with the corresponding branch from the hepatic artery ; the splenic next sends off the vasa brevia, five or six small branches which pass to the great end of the stomach, and inosculate with the proper gastric arteries ; the splenic artery then divides into several branches, which enter the foramina on the concave surface of the spleen, and ramify through its spongvâ€™ substance. The superior mesenteric artery arises a little below the coeliac, descends obliquely forwards and to the left behind the pancreas, and over the duodenum ; it then passes be- tween the layers of the mesentery and takes an arched course towards the right iliac fossa ; from its concave side arise three branches, the ileo-colic, right colic, and mid- dle colic ; these three branches proceed between the la- minae of the mesocolon to the large intestine, each divides into two branches, which unite with those on either side, and form arches, from the convexities of which branches arise, some of which subdivide and unite again in the same manner as the first branches ; near the intestine straight branches proceed on the anterior and posterior surface, and supply the muscular and mucous coats ; from the convex side of the mesenteric artery eighteen or twen- ty branches arise, these proceed between the laminae of the mesentery, divide, and form arches, from which new branches arise, these again divide, and again unite in an arched manner; these divisions and subsequent inoscula- tions occur three or four times before the arteries arrive

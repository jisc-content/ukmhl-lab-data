backwards, and is lost on the sheath of the femoral L 2 vessels. That part of the fascia which is internal to this opening is named the pubic portion of the fascia lata; it covers the pectinseus muscle, adheres to the spine and linea innominata of the pubis, extends behind the femoral vessels, and is continuous with the fascia iliaca; that part of the fascia lata external to the saphenic opening is called the iliac portion; it covers the sar- torius, tensor vaginae, rectus, and iliacus internus mus- cles, and is continued obliquely in front of the femoral vessels, in the form of a crescentic or falciform process, the concavity of which is directed downwards and in- wards ; the convexity is towards the ilium, and attached to Poupart’s ligament; the lower cornu of this crescen- tic process is continuous with the outer cornu of the saphenic opening, and the upper cornu extends in front of the femoral vessels to their inner side, and is inserted along with the third insertion of Poupart’s ligament into the linea innominata, or the ilio pectinaaa: between the margin of the falciform process and the pubic part of the fascia lata is a thin membrane, perforated by nu- merous vessels ; this is termed the cribriform fascia ; it is connected on either side to the iliac and pubic por- tions of the fascia lata, and extends from the saphena vein to Poupart’s ligament, in front of the femoral ves- sels ; it adheres to the anterior part of the sheath of the latter, or to the fascia transversalis; when this cribri- form fascia is removed, the falciform process is made more distinct.—(See Description cf Crural Hernia, page 135.) The fascia lata, in some situations, parti- cularly along the outer side of the limb, is seen to con- sist of two laminae of fibres ; the external take a circular, the intemal a longitudinal direction; these two laminae are very distinctly separated at the upper and outer- part of the thigh by the imsertion of the tensor vaginae femoris ; the deep layer, which in this situation is very strong, is attached to the capsular ligament of the hip joint, and to the external head of the rectus muscle.— Raise the fascia lata from the, anterior and lateral parts of the thigh, several muscles will come into view, the femoral vessels also in the groin will be partially ex- posed, they are still somew'hat concealed by a quantity

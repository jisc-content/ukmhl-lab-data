177 the abdomen opposite the last dorsal vertebra, and nearly in the mesial line ; the thoracic duct and vena azygos iiscend through it, along the right side of the aorta ; the splanchnic nenâ€™es, particularly the left, sometimes pass through this opening ; but in general these nerves perfo- rate the crura at a little distance from the aorta. The opening for the oesophagus and eighth pair of nerves is superior and anterior to that for the aorta, and is a little to the left of it ; it is of an oval figure ; its parietes are fleshy, and are formed by the decussating fasciculi from the crura ; the origin of these separate the oesophageal from the aortic opening. The opening for the vena cava is situated at the back part of the right division of the tendon, anterior to the insertion of the right crus ; this foramen is perfectly tendinous; it is somewhat quadrila- teral, and appears larger than the vein ; the edges are at- tached to the vessel, and prolonged upon its coats ; the anterior margin being continued on the abdominal portion, and the posterior margin on the thoracic portion of the vein. Posterior to the ensiform cartilage there is a small triangular space on each side, where the diaphragm is deficient, and through which the peritonaeum is connected to the pleura and pericardium; through this space also the cellular membrane in the mediastinum is continuous with that between the abdominal muscles. Use, it is the principal muscle in inspiration ; by its action it en- larges the thorax in the perpendicular direction, for the contraction of the crura draws down the cordiform tendon, and fixes it ; and then, when the fibres of the superior diaphragm contract, they descend, and instead of being conve.x towards the chest they become nearly straight, so as to present a plane surface to the abdo- men, looking downwards and forwards. As the fleshy fibres are longest at the sides, it is here the greatest descent in the muscle occurs, consequently the thorax is most enlarged on each side beneath the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, its elasticity and the connexion of the pleurae and pericardium to its superior surface, cause it to re-ascend, so as to present a concave sur- face to the abdomen, and so diminish the capacity of the thorax. The diaphragm also assists in coughing, I 3

365 The Vertebral Artery, arises from the-upper and back' part of the subclavian : ascends behind the inferior thy- roid artery, enters the foramen in the transverse pro- cess of the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra, and ascends through the several foramina in the superior vertebrae as high as the second; it then bends backwards and out- wards ; passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas; it then turns backwards and in- wards, round the articulation of this vertebra with the condyle, and pierces the dura mater; it then ascends obliquely inwards and forwards between the olivary and- pyramidal bodies, and at the lower edge of the pons it unites with the opposite, to form the basilar artery ; in this course it gives small branches to the spinal nerves and to the inter-vertebral muscles; at the foramen mag- num it gives off, 1st and 2d, the posterior and anterior spinal arteries, which descend all along the spinal cord; 3rd, the inferior cerebellar artery often arises from the basilar; it runs tortuously around the medulla oblongata, below the vagus, and sends its numerous branches to the inferior surface of the cerebellum. The basilar artery is formed by the confluence of the two vertebral; it ascends in the median groove on the pons varolii, sends small branches to the surround- ing membrane, and at the upper edge of that body it dh’ides into four branches, two for each side, 1st, the superior cerebellar artery, passes outwards and back- wards, to the upper surface of each hemisphere of the cerebellum on which it spreads its branches; 2d, the posterior cerebral artery, this receives the posterior branch of the internal carotid, bends backwards and out- wards, and spreads its ramifications on the posterior lobe of the cerebral hemisphere. (See page 364.) The thyroid axis arises from the upper part of the subclavian close to the scalenus and phrenic nerve, it immediately divides into the four following branches :— 1st, the inferior thyroid, ascends tortuously behind the common carotid, then bends downwards and inwards, sends branches to the trachea, oesophagus, &c. and is distributed to the thyroid gland, in which it inoscur lates with the superior thyroid, and with the arteries

215 the same course as in the male, only somewhat more curved. The vagina is seen to surround the neck of the uterus, and thence to descend obliquely downwards and forwards between the rectum, the bladder, and urethra ; closely connected to the latter, and but loosely to the rectum. The vagina is lined by a vascular mem- brane, which is covered externally by a dense fibrous tissue and by numerous vessels, particularly veins, which form a plexus (retiform) or spongy body, which is situ- ated beneath the sphincter vaginae muscle ; the vagina is also partially covered by oeritonsenm on its posterior- surface : between the bladder and vagina the ureter may be observed ; its course is longer and more curved in the female pelvis than in the male. The Uterus is situated between the bladder and rectum, and connect- ed to both by peritonaeum ; the broad ligament which is a fold of peritonaeum, and the round ligament which is a fasciculus of blood-vessels and nerves bound toge- ther by dense cellular tissue, connect each side of this organ to the pelvis, and to the inguinal region. The uterus is -somewhat pyriform or triangular, the larger end or fundus being superiorly and posteriorly, the smaller end or cervix inferiorly and {interiorly ; the in- termediate portion is named the body ; the vagina sur- rounds'the cendx uteri, and ascends higher posteriorly than anteriorly; at the lower extremity of the cervix is a small transverse slit, termed the os uteri or os tincce. The utei-us consists of a dense fibrous substance, co- vered externally by peritonaeum, and lined throughout by mucous membrane, which is continued from the va- gina throughout the entire orgai^, and thence into the Fallopian tubes, along which it extends to their fimbri- ated extremity, where it becomes continuous with the peritonaeum on each side, thus presenting a singular example of the continuity of a mucous and serous membrane with each other : the mucous membrane of the uterus is often of a very dark colour, and is marked by several lines. The cavity of the uterus is very small; it is somewhat larger in the superior fundus than elsewhere. The Fallopian tubes are from four to five inches in length ; they extend from the fundus uteri upwards and outwards at first, and then a little down-

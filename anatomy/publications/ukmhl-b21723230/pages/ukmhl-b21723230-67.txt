49 Icriorly by the pale mucous membrane descending into the oesophagus; these and the crico-thyroid muscles are the dilators of the rima glottidis. Arytenoideus, fills the interval between the aryte- noid cartilages, and is enclosed in a fold of mucous membrane : it consists of oblique and transverse fibres ; the former consist of two or three fasciculi, which pass from the apex of one cartilage to the base of the oppo- site ; the transverse fibres are more numerous, and are attached to the posterior surface of each cartilage. Use, to approximate these cartilages, and close the sides of the rima: these, together with the thyro and crico-ary- tenoidei laterales are the contractors of the rima glottis. In the arj’teno-epiglottidean folds, fleshy fibres are sometimes discernible, and have been described as dis- tinct muscles, and named from their situation, aryteno- epiglottidean and thyreo-epiglottidean or the depres- sors of the epiglottis. In the human subject, however, these are never sufficiently well marked to merit the ap- pellation of distinct muscles. The arteries which supply the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid; the former is a branch of the external carotid, the latter of the subcla- vian. The laryngeal nerves are four in number, two on each side, the superior and inferior; both are derived from the par vagum or pneumo-gastric; the former arising from it near the base of the cranium, the latter, on the right side, comes off from this trunk at the lower part of the neck, and on the left side it arises from it in the thorax, below the arch of the aorta; the inferior laryngeal nerves are principally distributed to the mus- I cles, and the superior to the membrane and glands of I the larynx, but not exclusively so. The inferior supply the posterior and lateral cricor I arj-tenoid and the thyro-arytenoid muscles ; the superior ‘ sends a large branch to the arytenoid, and a small, but very long filament to the crico-thyroid muscle; several I branches of this nerve are distributed to the epiglottis, I apd to the mucous membrane at the glottis, which in this situation possesses great sensibility.

16 tiranchos of the external carotid ; the nerves are branches of the 7th and 5th pair. The facial artery, which is a branch of the external carotid, is seen wind- ing round the side of the jaw, anterior to the masseter, and running in a contorted course towards the commis- sure of the lips, and thence ascending along the side of the nose to the internal canthus of the eye; in this course it sends off numerous muscular branches, the coronary arteries of the lips, the 7iasal branches, and terminates in the angular branch, which communicates with the ophthalmic artery at the inner side of the orbit. The fascial artery and its divisions are accom- panied by corresponding veins; the fascial vein at the lower edge of the jaw, generally, but not always, di- vides into two branches, one, superficial, joins the external jugular vein, the other passing deeper in the neck, joins the internal jugular. The external carotid artery, which is seen ascending from the neck into the parotid gland, gives off numerous branches to its several lobules, and to the ear, and a little below the latter divides into the transversalis faciei, temporalis superfi- cialis and maxillaris interna. The transverse artery-of the face crosses the masseter above, sometimes below the parotid duct, and divides into small muscular branches, some of which communicate with the facial and infraorbital arteries. The temporal artery ascends behind the articulation of the maxilla on the temporal aponeurosis, and soon divides into an anterior and pos- terior branch ; the former is directed towards the fore- head, supplies the integuments and muscles there, and communicates with the frontal branches of the ophthal- mic artery; the posterior division of the temporal runs tortuously upwards and backw'ards, and divides into numerous branches, which supply the integuments and inosculate with the occipital and posterior auris arte- ries. The internal maxillary artery is the largest branch of the carotid; it bends in behind the neck of the lower jaw, betw'een the bone and the internal late- ral ligament, then runs tortuously between the ptery- goid muscles, upwards, forwards, and inwards, to the lower and back part of the orbit, where it sinks info the spheno-maxillary fossa; in this course it sends off the

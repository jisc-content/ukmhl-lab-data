353 The Retina may be best exposed by gently tearing oft the choroid, (the eye being held under water,) and then placing an inverted glass globe filled with clear diluted spirits over the dissection, the retina will be- come slightly opaque, and have a magnified appear- ance, The optic nerve having pierced the choroid coat ends in this thin and delicate membrane, which is transparent in the very recent eye, but soon be- comes opaque after death ; the retina extends around the sides and fore-part of the vitreous humour without adhering to it, as far forwards as within two lines of the lens ; here the nervous matter ends by an abrupt line, along which a small blood-vessel runs. The reti- na is divisible into three layers; first, lamina serosa; second, lamina ners'osa; and third, lamina vasculosa. The external or serous layer is extremely delicate, it may be separated by gentle pressure with the handle of the knife, under water. This membrane was dis- covered by Dr. Jacob. The middle, or the nervous layer, is soft and grey, and continuous with the optic nerse; the internal or vascular layer is very delicate ; it lies on the vitreous humour, and is continued on its fore-part to the capsule of the lens, where it becomes adherent to the hyaloid membrane. Dissect off the posterior half of the retina from the vitreous humour, or cut transversely a fresh eye, and allow the humours to fall out, then look on the concave surface of the re- tina, and we may observe in the centre of the optic nerve a small dark point, the porus opticus; this is the central arterj’ of the retina, which then spreads its branches in the internal layer of the retina; about two lines external to this, and in the axis of the eye, is a small yellow or orange spot, the punctum aureum; the retina is thrown into folds around this; some describe a perforation and deficiency of the retina at this spot, it rather appears, how’ever, to depend on some peculiar or- ganization. Ihe humours of the eye are the aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous. The aqueous humour is perfectly colourless, about five giains in quantity; it fills the anterior and poste- rior chambers, the former about two lines, the latter

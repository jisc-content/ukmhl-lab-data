268 are most numerous; they are found in three situations, in the cavity of the sinus, external to the dura mater, or internal to it ; the first are termed the glandulae mediae, the second, the extemae, and the third the intemae; their use or structure is unknown, most probably they are by no means allied to the glandular system. The longitudi- nal sinus, like all the other sinuses, consists of two tunics, the internal or the venous membrane, and the external or fibrous coat derived from the dura mater ; this mem- brane is described as dividing into two layers on either side of the cavity ; one continues to adhere to the bone, and the other laminae descend on either side of the sinus, and unite in the falx ; the base of the triangular cavity thus formed is towards the bone, the apex towards the falx ; in addition to many small veins, from the bones and from the dura naater, this sinus receives near the vertex eight or ten large veins from the upper surface of each hemisphere of the brain, these run obliquely for- wards between the coats of the sinus, some for an inch, others for less, before they open into the cavity, and just as they are terminating, they turn slightly, so that their mouths look inwards, or towards those of the opposite side ; all the veins which enter the sinus do not take the oblique course now described, and which is most probably designed to impede the reflux of the blood from the sinus into the cerebral veins. The inferior longitudinal sinus is not always present, it resembles a small vein enclosed in tbe lower edge of the falx near its base, it receives small veins from the corpus callo- sum, and ends in the following; the straight sinus is situated in the median line, enclosed between tbe la- minae of the base of the falx and above the tentorium, it receives the blood from the lateral ventricles returned by the two venae Galeni ; this sinus proceeds backwards and downwards, and ends in the confluence of the two lateral and longitudinal sinuses ; it presents internally the same fibrous appearance as the great longitudinal sinus. The lateral are the largest sinuses, of somewhat an elliptical figure, each proceeds at first horizontally outwards and forwards, enclosed between the laminae of the tentorium, in a groove in the occipital bone, and

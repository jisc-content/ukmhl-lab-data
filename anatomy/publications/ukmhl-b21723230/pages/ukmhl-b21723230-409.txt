PART IV. DISSECTION OF THE JOINTS. W HEN all the muscles, vessels, nerves, &c., have been dissected, the student may examine the anatomy of the joints: in almost every articulation we find a smooth and delicate membrane extended over the articulating sur- face of each bone ; this is termed a synovial membrane, it forms a shut sac like a serous membrane, and con- stantly contains a small quantity of a glairy fluid, termed synovia; this membrane is generally protected externally by ligaments, which also sei-ve to connect the bones together ; these ligaments are termed capsular when they surround the joint, as in the shoulder and hip ; when they are confined to a particular part they are termed accessory ligaments, or lateral, anterior, poste- rior, &c. &c, TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATIONS. Each condyle of the inferior maxilla is received into that portion of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone, which is anterior to the fissure, it also moves on the transverse root of the zjâ€™goma ; this joint is strengthen- ed by the external and internal lateral and the stylo- maxillary ligaments, an inter-articular cartilage, two synovial membranes, and an imperfect capsular liga- ment. The external lateral ligament arises broad from the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, descends oblique-- ly back, and is inserted narrow into the outer side of the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw.

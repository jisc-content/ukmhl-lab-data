287 ' i choroid and sclerotic coats of this organ, and terminates in the retina. The TiniiD, or Motores Oculorum, are smaller than the optic; each arises from the inner side of the crus cerebri, close to the pons, behind the floor of the third ventricle, and between the posterior arteiy of the cerebrum and the anterior artery of the cerebellum ; this round nerve passes forwards and outwards external to the cavernous sinus, through the foramen lacerum orbitale, and is distributed to five of the seven muscles contained in the orbit. The FOURTH or Trochleatores are the smallest of the cerebral nerves ; each arises by two or three de- licate filaments from the valve of Vieussens and from the processus a cerebello ad testem; it takes a long course fom'ards and outwards betw'een the cerebrum and cerebellum, enters a small canal between the layers of the tentorium, beliind the posterior clinoid process, and continues its course along the outer side of the cavernous sinus through the foramen lacerum orbitale to the supe- rior oblique muscle. The FIFTH or Trifaciae or Trigemini are the largest of the cerebral nerves; each consists of nearly one hundred fine filaments, but loosely connected to each other, and very easily detached from the brain; arises by two fasciculi, one from the angle between the pons Varolii and the crus cerebelli, the other from the corpus pyramidale in the substance of the pons; these pass together forwards and outwards over the point of the petrous bone in a sort of canal formed of dura ma- ter, and lined by arachnoid membrane, which last is re- flected on the nerve, so as to form a cul de sac around it; in the middle fossa of the base of the cranium it expands into a large grey swelling, (the triangular, se- milunar, ox gasserian ganglion;) this ganglion is con- cave posteriorly; convex anteriorly and externally; the dura mater covers and adheres intimately to its liplexiform surface; three large branches proceed from i it, the ophthalmic, superior inferior maxillary ; 1 the first passes into the orbit through the foramen lace- i. rum ; the second leaves the cranium by the foramen lirotundura, and the third by the foramen ovale.

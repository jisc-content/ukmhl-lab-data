347' the surface of the eye ; along this canal the tears are sup- posed by some to be directed inwards towards the puncta, others however deny that any such space can exist, and ;tffirm that the lachrymal secretion flows along each pal- pebral sinus, and is directed inwards by the action of the orbicular muscle ; the skin of each palpebra is thin, the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue very loose and reticular; beneath this the orbicular muscle is expanded.â€”(See page 4.) The tarsal cartilages are thin elastic plates ; the superior is semilunar and larger than the inferior, which is long and narrow ; the ciliary margins are thick ; their orbital edges thin and connected to the orbit by the palpebral ligaments w'hich are a continuation of the peri- osteum ; these ligaments are stronger towards the temple, where they decussate and attach the cartilages at their external canthus or commissure ; the tendo oculi fixes them internally. Between each tarsal cartilage and the conjunctiva are the Meibomian glands ox follicles ; they are of a white or yellow colour, are arranged in nearly parallel vertical rows, and are more numerous in the up- per eye-lid ; they secrete a thin sebaceous fluid, which is discharged by a row of small holes along the edge of each tarsus behind the cilise. The cilics arise from bulbs which are beneath the skin ; those of the upper eyelid are more numerous than those in the lower; both are cur\'ed, convex towards each other. The Puncta Lackrymalia are two small holes always open, directed backwards and outwards, opposite each other ; they meet when the lids are closed ; each is situated in a little cartilaginous projection, about two lines from the inner canthus; each is the orifice of a small duct. The Lachrymal ducts extend from the puncta to the lachrymal sac ; the superior is longer and more curved than the inferior; the former is concave inferiorly ; the latter is nearly straight, a little concave upwards ; they both open into the external part of the sac, a little above its middle, sometimes by one, and sometimes by distinct orifices, behind the tendo oculi; each duct is surrounded by a process of that tendon, and lined by mucous mem- brane.

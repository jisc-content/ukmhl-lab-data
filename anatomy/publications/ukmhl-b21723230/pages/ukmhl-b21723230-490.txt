472 of the forearm ; this sigmoid cavity has a great resem- blance to the letter c, if viewed in profile ; it is covered with cartilage ; its posterior vertical portion is larger than the anterior horizontal ; it is divided by a middle ridge into two lateral portions, of which the internal is the larger; these are each again divided by a transverse fur- row, which ends in a notch at either margin. The body of the ulna is divided into three surfaces by three lines ; these surfaces are larger above than below ; the anterior is slightly grooved for the flexor profundus, and presents superiorly a vascular foramen, directed obliquely upwards; the internal surface is broad and concave above, and co- vered by muscles, below it is round and subcutaneous ; the posterior surface is irregular ; it is divided into two portions by a prominent line ; of these the superior and internal is broad, and gives attachment to the anconaeus ; the inferior and outer portion is long and narrow', and covered by the extensors of the thumb ; the anterior edge is round, and gives insertion to the flexor profundus and pronator quadratus ; the posterior edge is very dis- tinct above, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis, common to the flexor profundus and flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris ; the external edge is sharp for the three superior fourths, and gives attachment to the interosse- ous ligament. The lower or carpal end of the ulna is small and round, and presents tw'o eminences ; the ex- ternal is named the head, it is round, and covered with cartilage, and is received into the cavity in the inner bor- der of the radius, and is contiguous inferiorly Wâ€™ith the fibro cartilage of the wrist; the internal eminence or the styloid process is more prominent, and on a level with the posterior surface of the bone ; it is conical, elongated, and a little everted ; it gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the wrist; these processes are sepa- rated posteriorly by a groove for the tendon of the exten- sor carpi ulnaris, and inferiorly by a depression for the insertion of the triangular fibro cartilage. The ulna is articulated above to the humerus and radius, and below to the radius and interarticular cartilage ; it is developed from three points of ossification, one for the shaft, and one for each extremity.

343 Use, to draw the malleus for\varcls, and thus to relax the membrana tympani. The labyrinth, or the internal ear, consists of the %estibulum, cochlea, semicircular canals, and meatus internus. Vestibulum is a small elliptical cavity behind the cochlea and in front of the semicircular canals, the fenestra ovalis opens on its external side, the five orifices of the semicircular canals open superiorly and poste- riorly, one opening from the cochlea is anteriorly, and posteriorly is the orifice of a small canal called the aque- duct of the vestibule. A delicate but vascular mem- brane lines this cavity; it is filled by a peculiar fluid, and extends into the aqueduct of the vestibule. The semicircular canals are three in number, superior, pos- terior, and horizontal ; the two first are vertical ; they are surrounded by the petrous bone in front of the mastoid cells and behind the vestibule ; the superior and posterior are joined by one end ; there are, there- fore, but five orifices of these canals in the vestibule; each of these tubes is lined by a vascular membrane filled rvith a fluid which communicates with that in the vestibule. The cochlea is in the anterior part of the jretrous bone, it is somewhat conical, the base towards the meatus internus, the apex towards the carotid ar- tery ; the cochlea, internally, consists of a central pillar placed somewhat horizontally, named the modiolus, and of a spiral tube passing round this axis two turns and a half; this tube is divided into two by a thin osseous ancl membranous plate, called lamina spiralis, and the two tubes are the scalae of the cochlea ; near the apex of the cochlea these scalae communicate ; near the base they separate ; one, the scala vestibuli, com- municates with the vestibule ; the other, the scala tym- pani, with the tympanum through the fenestra rotunda ; the modiolus is hollow and expanded towards the apex ; this expansion is called the infundibulum ; a branch of the auditory nerve passes through this cavity; the aque- duct of the cochlea terminates in a small slit-like open- ing in the petrous bone just below the meatus audito- rius internus. The portio mollis of the seventh pair of nerves descends along the meatus auditorius internus,

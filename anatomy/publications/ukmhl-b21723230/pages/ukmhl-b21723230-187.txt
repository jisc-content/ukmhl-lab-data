iC9 gus, and are distributed almost wholly to the stomach ; some few branches pass along the lesser omentum to the liver. The splanchnic nerves are two in number, a right and left; they are each formed by filaments from the dorsal ganglions of the sympathetic ner\'e in the thorax; they enter the abdomen either along with the aorta, or perforate the crura of the diaphragm on either side of that vessel ; in the abdomen each nerve soon ends in a large ganglion, the semilunar ganglion, from which numerous branches pass across the aorta, around the cceliac axis, and communicating with each other, form the nervous plexus, named solar or cceliac plexus, from which a fasciculus of nerves extends along each of the branches of the cceliac artery to supply the viscera in the epigastric region; thus a few accompany the gas- tric artery, and communicate with the eighth pair on the stomach ; several surround the hepatic artery, and by ii are conducted to the liver ; in like manner others also pass to the spleen. From the lower part of the so- lar plexus several large branches descend and become attached to the superior and inferior mesenteric arte- ries form plexuses around these vessels, and receive additional branches from the lumbar or abdominal gang- lions of the sympathetic ; these nerves then twine around the mesenteric arteries and their branches, and are thus conducted to the intestines, in the internal tu- nic of which they terminate. (See Anatomy of the Nervous System.) The student may now remove the abdominal viscera. Tie the lower extremity of the oeso- phagus and the upper end of the rectum, each with two ligatures, and divide these tubes between them : dissect out the vena cava from the liver, cut across the hepatic vessels, the cceliac axis, the superior and inferior me- senteric arteries ; and then separate the liver, spleen, pancreas, and alimentary canal, from their connexions to the parietes of the abdomen ; next clean the surface of the abdominal aorta and vena cava, the right and left kidney, and the renal capsules. The abdominal aorta may be now seen to pass into the abdomen, between the crura of the diaphragm, opposite the last dorsal verte- bra ; it then descends obliquely to the left side, and di- vides on the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra into the I

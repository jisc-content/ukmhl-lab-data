brain, and in difl'erent subjects : in the child it is reddish, in the old it is grey or ashy. It consists of a number of very minute globules, connected together by the pia ma- ter and vessels. The white or medullary substance is more firm, and when fresh, has some elasticity, and in many parts appears distinctly fibrous ; its divided surface appears dotted with red spots ; these are the divided vessels, they vary in number and size in different subjects ; in a very fresh brain, when a section has been made of this white substance, it will, by its elasticity, force the blood to exude out for some little time in small drops from the divided vessels. The corpus callosum is now seen in the median line of the cerebrum, but nearer the frontal than the occipital bone, between three or four inches long, convex, white, marked by two or three raised longitudinal lines close and nearly parallel to each other, (the raphe,) from these several transverse lines pass to either side ; its posterior end broad, round, and a little concave, is bent downwards, and is continuous on either side with the fornix and the hippocampi; its ante- rior end is also round, and bent downwards and back- wards, is continued on each side into the anterior lobes, and in the middle it joins the tuber cinereum and the optic commissure; the corpus callosum connects the Avhite fibrous substance of the hemispheres, and is therefore properly called the great commissure of the cerebrum ; it covers the lateral ventricles, the septum lucidum, and the fornix. Divide this substance at a little distance from either side of the raphe, the lateral ventricles will be opened, press the middle portion of the corpus callo- sum to one side, and the septum lucidum may be seen descending in the mediain line from it to the upper sur- face of the fornix. The septum lucidum separates the twâ€™o lateral ventricles, triangular, the apex behind, the base before, the upper end connected to the corpus callosum ; the lower edge to the fornix posteriorly, and anteriorly to the inferior curved portion of the corpus callosum ; it consists of four laminae, two on each side, grey externally, white internally ; between the white laminae a small cavity exists termed the fifth ventricle. This cavity is naturally closed, but when the corpus

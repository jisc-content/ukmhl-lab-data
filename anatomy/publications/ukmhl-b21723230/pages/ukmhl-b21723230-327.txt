309 to the muscles of the palate, to the upper part of the pharj’ux, and to the mucous membrane of the gums ; 3d the corda tympani and some accompanying filaments to form a plexus which supplies the sub-maxillary gland; 4th, a few branches w'hich descend along the hyo-glossus muscle to communicate with the ninth or the lingual nerve ; 5th, a fasciculus of nerves to the sublingual gland, and to the surrounding mucous membrane ; lastly, at the tongue it divides into several branches, some pass deep into the tissue of the tongue, others, which are long and fine, mount towards its surface, and are lost in the mucous membrane and the papillae at the anterior part of the tongue. Facial Nerve or Portio Dura of the seventh pair ; this nerve is passing along the aqueduct of Fal- lopius in the temporal bone it receives superiorly the vidian nerve ; at the back part of the tympanum it sends off that nerve again which then receives the name ofcordi tympani, here it also sends off small twigs to the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles; as it escapes by the stylo- mastoid foramen it gives off three branches, the posterior auricular, stylo-hyoid, and sub-mastoid ; the first, or the posterior auricular, bends upwards and backwards be- hind the cartilage of the ear, to which it sends several long branches, others also pass backwards to the integu- ments covering the mastoid process and occipital bone ; the second, or the stylo-hyoid nerve, is distributed to the digastric and styloid muscles, and anastomoses with the sympathetic and glosso-pharyngeal nerves; the third or the sub-mastoid branch, perforates the posterior belly of the digastric, supplies it with several filaments, and then communicates with the glasso-pharyngeal nerve around the jugular vein close to the base of the cranium, other filaments descend and join the laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric nerve. The facial nerve then turns for- wards across the external carotid artery and throu«>h the parotid gland ; in this substance it divides into two large branches, the superior or larger is called temporo-facial • the inferior which is smaller, the cervico-facial, these two branches take different directions, but are still connected together by cross branches which interlace with each other

The horizontal lines represent the segments of the limb respectively. The intermediate spaces will of course correspond to the joints. The red hues represent the group of muscles passing from one segment to another, and opposite which are their names In order to ascertain the number of muscles divided in amputation through any joint, /V'"'-'""*' ijcLweeu snouiuer ana arm, ana it wiu iubcir.<ri.i, nuee . x^xv^^iix^g f^icy^^y^ ^..^ . whith, being abided together, make 11, the number of muscles divided. By proceeding' in the same manner with the other joints, it will be found that in amputating at the elbow lb are divM, at the wi-ist 15, at the hip 22, at the knee 12. and at the ankle 12. For instance, in the case of Matthew Wood, alluded to by Cheselden in his Anatomy, whose entire upper extremity 5^ ^ windmill, there were 12 muscles torn across. This is proved by the horizontal line drawn between the Trunk and Shoulder. Crossing three red lines, and opposite tlie lowei end of theue lines, are the numbers, 7, 3, and 2, the sum of which is 12. The table also shows the name and number of the muscles which connect the segments between which they extena.

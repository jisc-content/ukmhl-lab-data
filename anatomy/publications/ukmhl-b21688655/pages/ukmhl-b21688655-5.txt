INTRODUCTORY NOTE. These tables will be found serviceable as a means of enabling the student to remember the details of information gathered by study of the subject in books and by observation. They are valueless as an assistance in " cramming ;" no aid will be derived from them until this detailed study has been accomplished. The explanatory notes appended to each table will be found sufficient to indicate the right method of employing it ; but—particularly with the table referring to amputations—these directions must be carefully read. In the table of " Motor Nerves of Muscles of the Lower Extremity " " Curral," by a printer's error, has been substituted for "Crural." The external popliteal branch of the great sciatic nerve is in the same table termed " Peroneal," a name less familiar to English students than to their American brothers. In using the tables of Motor Nerves it will be found convenient to read from right to left, proceeding from the< column of ^' totals " to those of distribution. The present series will be followed at intervals by other Anatomographical tables.

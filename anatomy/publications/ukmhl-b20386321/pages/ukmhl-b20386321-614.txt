476 NERVOUS SYSTEM. intellectual faculties are exercised, the convolutions have a very simple arrange- ment, presenting few undulations ; and the sulci between them are less deep than in the adult. In old age, when the mental faculties have diminished in activiiy, the convolutions become much less prominently marked. Those convolutions which are the largest and most constantly present, are the convolutions of the corpus callosum, the convolution of the longitudinal fissure, the supraorbital convolution, and the convolutions of the outer surface of the hemisphere. 261.â€”Upper Surface of the Brain, the Pia Mater having' been removed. Girrtt Longitudinal Fissure The convolution of the corpus callosum (gyrus fornicatus) is always well marked. It lies parallel with the free surface of the corpus callosum, commencing, on the tinder surface of the brain, in front of the anterior perforated space ; it winds round the curved border of the corpus callosum, and passes along its upper surface as far as its posterior extremity, where it is connected with the convolutions of the posterior lobe; it then curves downwards and forwards, embracing the cerebral peduncle, passes into the middle lobe, forming the hippocampus major, and termi- nates just behind the point from whence it arose. The supraorbital convolution on the under surface of the anterior lobe is well marked. The convolution of the longitudinal fissure bounds the margin of the fissure on the upper surface of the hemisphere. It commences on the under surface of the brain, at the anterior perforated space, passes forwards along the inner margin ot the anterior lobe, being here divided by a deep sulcus, in which the olfactory

6 THE SKELETON. cularly from the upper part of the body. The body is of a triangular form ■ deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downwards anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and fore part of the adjacent vertebra. It presents in front a median longitudinal ridge, separating two lateral depressions for the attachment of the Longus colli muscles of each side. The odontoid process presents two articulating surfaces : one in front of an oval form, for articulation with, the atlas; another behind, for the transverse ligament; the latter frequently encroaching on the sides of the process ; the apex is pointed. Below the apex, the process is somewhat enlarged, and presents on either side a rough impression for the attachment of the odontoid or check ligaments, which connect it to the occipital bone ; the base of the process, whore it is attached to the body, is constricted, so as to prevent dis- placement from the transverse ligament, which binds it in this situation to the anterior arch of the atlas. Sometimes, however, this process does become displaced, especially in children, in whom the ligaments are more relaxed : instant death is the result of this accident. The pedicles are broad and strong, especially their anterior extremities, which coalesce with the sides of the body and the root of the odontoid process. The laminas are thick and strong, and the spinal foramen very large. The superior articular surfaces are round, slightly convex, directed upwards and outwards, and are peculiar in being supported on the body, pedicles, and transverse processes. The inferior articular surfaces have the same direction as those of the other cervical vertebras. The superior intervertebral notches are very shallow, and lie behind the articular processes ; the inferior in front of them, as in the other cervical vertebras. The transverse processes are very small, not bifid, and per- forated by the vertebral foramen, or foramen for the vertebral artery, which is directed obliquely upwards and outwards. The spinous process is of large size, very strong, deeply channelled on its under surface, and presents a bifid tubercular extremity for the attachment of muscles, which serve to rotate the head upon the spine. Seventh Cervical (fig. 4). The most distinctive character of this vertebra is the existence of a very long and prominent spinous pro- cess ; hence the name ' Vertebra prominens.' This process is thick, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, and has attached to it the ligamentum nuchas. The trans- verse process is usually of large size, especially its posterior root ; its upper surface has usually a shallow groove, and it seldom pre- sents more than a trace of bifurca- tion at its extremity. The vertebral foramen is sometimes as large as in the other cervical vertebras, usually smaller, on one or both sides, and sometimes wanting. On the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it oil both sides; but the usual arrange- ment is for both artery and vein to pass through the foraliieii in the transverse process of the sixth cervical. Characters of The Dorsal Vertebra The bodies of the dorsal vertebras resemble those in the cervical and lumbar regions at the respective ends of this portion of the spine 5 but in the middle 4.— 7th Cervical Vertebra, or Vertebra Prominens.

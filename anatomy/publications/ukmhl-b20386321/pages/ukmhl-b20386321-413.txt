Deep Muscles. diately below the tuberosity and oblique line, and ex- tending, below, to within a short distance of the Prona- tor quadratus. It also arises from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane, and occasionally by a fleshy slip from the inner side of the base of the coronoid process. The fibres pass downwards, and terminate in a flattened tendon, which passes beneath the annular ligament, is then lodged in the^ntexspace bc- t/ween the two heads of the Flexor brcvis pollicis, and entering a tendino-osseous canal similar to those for the other flexor tendons, is in- serted into the base of the last Relations. By its anterior surface, with the Flexor sub- limis digitorum, Flexor carpi raclialis, Supinator Longus and Radial vessels. By its poste- rior surface, with the radius, interosseus membrane, and Pronator quadratus. By its ulnar border, with the Flexor profundus digitorum, from which it is separated by the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve. The Pronator Quadratus is a small, flat, quadrilateral muscle, extending trans- versely across the front of the radius and ulna, above their carpal extremities. It arises from the oblique line on the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, and the surface of bone immediately below it; from the internal border of the ulna; and from a strong aponeurosis which covers the inner third of the muscle. The fibres pass horizontally outwards, to be inserted into the lower fourth of the an- terior surface and external border of the shaft of the radius. Relations. By its anterior

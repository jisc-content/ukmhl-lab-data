Behind^ it is separated from the inner side of the humerus above, by the long and inner heads of the Triceps, the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery inter- vening ; and from the front of the bone below, by the insertion of the Coraco- brachialis muscle, and by the Brachialis anticus. By its outer side, it is in relation with the commencement of the median nerve, and the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps muscles, which slightly overlap the artery. By its inner side, its upper half is in relation with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, its lower half with the median nerve. It is accompanied by two vena3 comites, which lie in close contact with the artery, being connected together at intervals by short transverse com- municating branches.

At the bend of the elbow, the brachial artery sinks deeply into a triangular interval, the base of which is directed upwards towards the humerus, and the sides of which are bounded, externally, by the Supinator longus, internally, by the Pronator radii teres; its floor is formed by the Brachialis anticus and Supinator fKbrevis. This space contains the brachial artery, with its accompanying veins ; the I radial and ulnar arteries ; the median and musculo-spiral nerves ; and the tendon ' of the Biceps. The brachial artery occupies the middle line of this space, and ^divides opposite the coronoid process of the ulna into the radial and ulnar arteries ; it is covered, in front, by the integument, the superficial fascia, and the median basilic vein, the vein being separated from direct contact with the artery by the bicipital fascia. Behind, it lies on the Brachialis anticus, which separates it from the elbow-joint. The median nerve lies on the inner side of the artery, but separated from it below by an interval of half an inch. The tendon of the Biceps lies to the outer side of the space, and the musculo-spiral nerve still more externally ly^n^unjon the Supinator brevis, and partly concealed by the Supinator longus. Peculiarities of the Artery as regards its Course. The brachial artery, accompanied by the median nerve, may leave the inner border of the Biceps, and descend towards the inner condyle of the humerus, where it usually curves round a prominence of bone, to which it is connected by a fibrous band ; it then inclines outwards, beneath or through the substance of the Pronator teres muscle, to the bend of the elbow. This variation bears considerable analogy with the normal condition of the artery in some of the carnivora: it has been referred to, above, in the description of the humerus. As regards its Division. Occasionally, the artery is divided for a short distance at its upper part into two trunks, which are united above and below. A similar peculiarity occurs in the main vessel of the lower limb. The point of bifurcation may be above or below the usual point, the former condition being by far the most frequent. Out of 481 examinations recorded by Mr. Quain, some Outer side. Median nerve.

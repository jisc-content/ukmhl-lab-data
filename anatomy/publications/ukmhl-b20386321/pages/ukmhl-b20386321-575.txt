437 BRANCHES OF SUPERIOR CAVA the following: The communicating branch between the two trunks enlarges and forms the future left innominate vein; the remaining part of the left trunk is obliterated as far as the heart, where it remains pervious, and forms the coro- nary sinus ; a remnant of the obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous band passing along the back of the left auricle and in front of the root of the left lung, called by Mr. Marshall the vestigial ibid of the pericardium. 241.—The VenaB CavaB and Azygos Veins,, with their Formative Branches. ricr Jtecju'a r The internal mammary weius, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corres- ponding with those derived ^^•from it. The two veins unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innominate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus, on the thyroid body, communicat- ing with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, behind the Sterno-thyroid muscles, communicating with its fellow by transverse branches, and terminates in the left vena innomi- nata. The right one, which is placed a little to the right of the median line, opens into the right vena innominata, just at its junction with the superior cava. These veins receive tracheal and inferior laryn- geal branches, and are providbd with valves at their termination in the innominate veins. The Superior Intercostal Veins return the blood from the upper intercostal spaces. The right superior inter- costal, much smaller than the left, closely corresponds with the superior inter- costal artery, receiving the blood from the first, or first and second intercostal

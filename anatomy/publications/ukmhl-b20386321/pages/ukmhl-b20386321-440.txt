MUSCLES AND FASCIAE. 302 Relations. By its superfi- cial surface, with the Gluteus maximus behind, the Tensor vaginae femoris, and deep fas- cia in front. By its deep surface, with the Gluteus mi- nimus and the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve. Its anterior border is blended with the Gluteus minimus. Its posterior border lies pa- rallel with the Pyriformis, the gluteal vessels interve- ning. This muscle should now be divided near its insertion and turned upwards, when the Glu- teus minimus will be exj 190.â€”Muscles of the Hip and Thigh. The Gluteus Minimus, the smallest of the three glutei, is placed immediately beneath the preceding. It is fan- shaped, arising from the outer surface of the ilium, between the middle and inferior curved lines, and behind, from the margin of the great sacro- sciatic notch: the fibres con- verge to the deep surface of a radiated aponeurosis, which, terminating in a tendon, is inserted into an impression on the anterior border of the great trochanter. A synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon and the great tro- chanter. Relations. By its superfi- cial surface, with the Gluteus medius, and the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve. By its deep surface, with the ilium, the reflected tendon of the Rectus femoris, and cap- sular ligament of the hip- joint. Its anterior margin is blended with the Gluteus me- dius. Its posterior margin is often joined with the tendon of the Pyriformis. The Pyriformis is a flat muscle, pyramidal in shape, lying almost parallel with the lower margin of the Glu- teus minimus. It is situ- ated partly within the pelvis at its posterior part, and partly SEMI-TCS'OINOEUS SEMJ-MCME

728 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. The internal saphenous vein is a vessel of considerable size which ascends obliquely upwards along the inner side of the thigh, below Poupart's ligament. It passes through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata to terminate in the femoral vein. This vessel is accompanied by numerous lymphatics, which return the lymph from the dorsum of the foot and inner side of the leg and thigh : they ter- minate in the inguinal glands, which surround the saphenous opening. Diverging from the same point are the superficial epigastric vessels, which run across Poupart's ligament, obliquely upwards and inwards, to the lower part of the abdomen; the superficial circumflexa ilii vessels, which pass obliquely outwards 388.â€”Femoral Hernia. Superficial Dissection. along Poupart's ligament to the crest of the ilium ; and the superficial external pudic vessels, which pass inwards to the perinseum and scrotum. These vessels supply the subcutaneous areolar tissue and the integument, and are accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels, which return the lymph from the same parts to the inguinal glands. The superficial inguinal glands are arranged in two groups, one of which is disposed above and parallel with Poupart's ligament, and the other below the ligament, surrounding the termination of the saphenous vein, and following (occasionally) the course of that vessel a short distance along the thigh. The upper chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the penis, scrotum, lower part of the abdomen, perinsoum, and buttock ; the lower chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The nerves supplying the integument of this region are derived from the ilio- inguinal, the genito-crural, and anterior crural. The ilio-inguinal nerve may be

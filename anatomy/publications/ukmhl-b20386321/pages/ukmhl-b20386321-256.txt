The Pelvis, so called from its resemblance to a basin, is stronger and more massively constructed than either the cranial or thoracic cavity ; it is a bony ring, interposed between the lower end of the spine, which it supports, and the lower extremities, upon which it rests. It is composed of four bones : the two ossa innomihata, which bound it on either side and in front; and the sacrum and coccyx, which complete it behind. ' The pelvis is divided by a prominent line, the linea ilio-pectinea, into the false and true pelvis. The false pelvis is all that expanded portion of the pelvic cavity which.' is situated above the linea ilio-pectinea. It is bounded on each side by the ossa ilii; in front it is incomplete, presenting a wide interval between the spinous processes of the ilia on either side, which is filled up in the recent state By the parietes of the abdomen; behind, in the middle line, is a deep notch. This broad shallow cavity is fitted to support the intestines, and to transmit part of their weight to the anterior wall of the abdomen. The true pelvis is all that part of the pelvic cavity which is situated beneath the linea ilio-pectinea. It is smaller than the false pelvis, but its walls are more*

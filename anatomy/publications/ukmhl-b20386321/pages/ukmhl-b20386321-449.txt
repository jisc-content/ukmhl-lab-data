The Beep Fascia of the leg is a broad, transverse, intermuscular septum, inter- posed between the superficial and deep muscles in the posterior tibio-fibular re- gion. On each side it is connected to the margins of the tibia and fibula. Above, where it covers the Popliteus, it is thick and dense, and receives an expansion from the tendon of the Semimembranosus ; it is thinner in the middle of the leg; but below, where it covers the tendons passing behind the malleoli, it is thickened. It is oontinued onwards in the interval between the ankle and the heel, where it covers the vessels, and is blended with the internal annular ligament. This fascia should now he removed, com- mencing from below opposite the tendons, and detaching it from the muscles in the direction of their fibres. The Popliteus is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, which forms part of the floor of the popliteal space, and is covered by a tendinous expansion, derived from the Semimembranosus muscle. It arises by a strong flat tendon, about an inch in length, from a deep depression on tho outer side of the external condyle of the femur, and from the posterior ligament of the knee-joint; and is inserted into the inner two-thirds of the triangular surface above the oblique line on the posterior surface of the shaft of the tibia, and into the tendinous expansion covering the sur- face of the muscle. The tendon of the muscle is covered by that of the Biceps and the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint ; it grooves the outer surface of the external semilunar cartilage, and is invested by the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the fascia above mentioned, which separates it from the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, popliteal vessels, and internal popliteal nerve. By its deep surface, with the superior tibio-fibular articula- tion, and back of the tibia.

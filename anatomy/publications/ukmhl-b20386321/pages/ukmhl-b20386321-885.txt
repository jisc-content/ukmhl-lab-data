PELVIC FASCIA. 747 close the front part of the outlet of the pelvis, blending with the posterior layer of the triangular ligament. At the level of a line extending from the lower part of the symphysis pubis to the spine of the ischium, is a thickened whitish 399.â€”Pelvic Fascia, band; this marks the attachment of the Levator ani muscle to the pelvic fascia, and corresponds to its point of division into two layers, the obturator and recto- vesical. The obturator fascia descends and covers the Obturator internus muscle. It is a direct continuation of the pelvic fascia below the white line above mentioned, and is attached to the pubic arch and to the margin of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. This fascia forms a canal for the pudic vessels and nerve in their pas- sage forwards to the perinaeum, and is continuous with a thin membrane which covers the perinaeal aspect of the Levator ani muscle, called the ischio-rectal (anal) fascia. The recto-vesical fascia (visceral layer of the pelvic fascia) descends into the pelvis upon the upper surface of the Levator ani muscle, and invests the prostate, bladder, and rectum. From the inner surface of the symphysis pubis a short rounded band is continued to the upper surface of the prostate and neck of the bladder^^orming the pubo-prostatic or anterior true ligaments of the bladder. At the side, this fascia is connected to the side of the prostate, enclosing this gland

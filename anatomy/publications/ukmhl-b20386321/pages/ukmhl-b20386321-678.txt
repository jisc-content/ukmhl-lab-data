SPINAL NERVES. 54Q The mode in which the plexus is formed is the following:—The first lumbar nerve gives off the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves, and a communicating branch to the second lumbar nerve. The second gives off the external cutaneous and genito-crural, and a communicating branch to the third nerve. The third nerve gives a descending filament to the fourth, and divides into two branches, which assist in forming the anterior crural and obturator nerves; sometimes, also, it furnishes a part of the accessory obturator. The fourth uerve completes the formation of the anterior crural, and the obturator, and gives off a communi- cating branch to the fifth lumbar ; sometimes it also furnishes part of the accessory obturator. The branches of the lumbar plexus are the Ilio-hypogastric. Obturator. Ilio-inguinal. Accessory obturator. Genito-crural. Anterior crural. External cutaneous. These branches may be divided into two groups, according to their mode of distribution. One group, including the ilio-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and part of the genito-crural nerves, supplies the lower part of theparietes of the abdomen ; 287.—The Lunibar Plexus and its Branches.

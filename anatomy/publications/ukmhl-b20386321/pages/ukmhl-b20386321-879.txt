74i DEEP PERINEAL FASCIA. The superficial and transverse perinaeal arteries are described at p. 402 ; and the superficial perinseal and inferior pudendal nerves at pp. 547, 549. The muscles of the perineeum in the female are, the Sphincter vaginae. Compressor urethras. Erector clitoridis. Sphincter am. Transversus perinsei. Levator ani. • . Coccygeus. The Sphincter Vagince surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urinae in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perineum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forward on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perineals inserted into the side of the Sphincter vagince, and the Levator ani into the side of the vagina. The other muscles are precisely similar to those in the male. The Accelerator urinae and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinaeal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb; and on either side is the crus penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. 395.—Deep Perinaeal Fascia. On the left side, the anterior layer has been removed. The Beep Perinceal Fascia (triangular ligament), is a dense membranous lamina, which closes the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. It is triangular in shape, about an inch and a half in depth, attached above, by its apex, to the under surface of the symphysis pubis and subpubic ligament; and, on each side, to the rami of the ischium and pubes, beneath the crura penis. Its inferior

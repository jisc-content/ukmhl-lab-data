Its posterior border is occasionally overlapped by the Latissimus dorsi ; sometimes an interval exists between the two muscles, in which is seen a portion of the Internal oblique. 163.â€”The External Oblique Muscle. Dissection. t)etach the External oblique by dividing it across, just in front of its attach- ment to the ribs, as far as its posterior border, and separating it below from the crest of ilium as far as the spine ; then separate the muscle carefully from the Internal oblique, which lies beneath, and turn it towards the opposite side. The Intemttl Or Ascending Oblique Muscle (fig. 164), thinner and smaller than the preceding, beneath which it lies, is of an irregularly quadrilateral form, and situated at the side and fore part of the abdomen. It arises, by fleshy fibres, from the outer half of Poupart's ligament, being attached to the groove on its upper snrface ; from the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the crest of tbe ilium, and from the lumbar fascia. From this origin, the fibres diverge: those from Poupart's ligament, few in number and paler in colour than the rest, arch

THE LUNGS. 681 together, and occasionally small lateral branches are given off from the sides of a main trunk. Each of the smaller subdivisions of the bronchi enters a pulmonary lobule (lobular bronchial tube), and, again subdividing, ultimately terminates in the intercellular passages and air-cells of which the lobule is composed. Within the lungs the bronchial tubes are circular, not flattened, and their constituent elements present the following peculiarities of structure. The cartilages are not imperfect rings, but consist of thin lamina), of varied form and size, scattered irregularly along the sides of the tube, being most distinct at the points of division of the bronchi. They may be traced into tubes, the dia- meter of which is only one-fourth of a line. Beyond this point, the tubes are wholly membranous. The fibrous coat, the longitudinal elasti:- fibres, are continued into

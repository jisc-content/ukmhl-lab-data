MUSCLES AND FASCI2E 280 Relations. By its superficial surface, with the same parts as the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. By its deep surface, with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, the wrist, the radial vessels, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. The Extensor Indicis is a narrow elongated muscle, placed on the inner side of, and parallel with, the preceding. It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, below the origin of the Extensor secundi inter- 175â€” Posterior Surface of the Forearm. Beep Muscles, nodii pollicis, and from the interosseous membrane. |Its tendon passes with ;:the Ex- tensor communis digiton-mi. through the same canal in jfce annular ligamejl and subse- quently joins that tendon of the Extensor communis which belongs to the index finger, opposite the lower end of the corresponding metacarpal bone. It is finally inserted into the second and third pha- langes of the index finger, in the manner already described. Relations. They are simi- lar to those of the preceding muscles. Nerves. The Supinator lorn gus, Extensor carpi radialis longior, and Anconeus, are supplied by branches from the musculo-spiral nerve. The remaining muscles of the ra- dial and posterior brachial regions, by the posterior in- terosseous nerye. Actions. The muscles of the radial and posterior bra- chial regions, which comprise all the Extensor and Supina- tor muscles, act upon the fore- arm, wrist, and hand ; they are the direct antagonists of the Pronator and Flexor muscles. The Anconeus as- sists the Triceps in extending the_forearm. The Supinator longus and brevis are the supinators of the forearm and hand ; the former muscle more especially acting as a supina- tor when the limb is pronated. When supination has been produced, the Supinator lon- gus, if still continuing to act, flexes the forearm. The Ex- tensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and Extensor carpi ulnaris muscles, are the

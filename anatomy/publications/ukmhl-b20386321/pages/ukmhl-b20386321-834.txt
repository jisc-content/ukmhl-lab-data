It is continuous with the mucous membrane of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys; externally, with the integument covering the glans penis; and is prolonged into the ducts of the glands which open into the urethra, viz., Cowper's glands, the prostate gland, and the vasa deferentia and vesiculse seminales, through the ejaculatory ducts. In the spongy and membranous portions the mucous membrane is arranged in longitudinal folds when the organ is contracted. Small papillae are found upon it, near the orifice ; and its epithelial lining is of the columnar variety, excepting near the meatus, where it is laminated. The muscular coat consists of two layers of plain muscular fibres, an external longitudinal layer, and an internal circular. The muscular tissue is most abundant in the prostatic portion of the canal. A thin layer of erectile tissue is continued from the corpus spongiosum round the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra to the neck of

ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 626 Vessels and Nerves. The arteries supplying the duodenum are the pyloric and pancreatico-duodenal branches of the hepatic, and the inferior pancreatico- duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric. The veins terminate in the gastro- duodenal and superior mesenteric. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus. The jejunum (jejunus, empty), so called from being usually found empty after death, includes the upper two-fifths of the rest of the small intestine. It com- mences at the duodenum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and terminates in the ileum; its convolutions being chiefly confined to the umbilical and left iliac regions. The jejunum is wider, its coats thicker, more vascular, and of a deeper colour than those of the ileum ; but there is no characteristic mark to distinguish the termination of the one and the commencement of the other. The ileum (sIXeIv, to tivist), so called from its numerous coils or convolutions, includes the remaining three-fifths of the small intestine. It occupies chiefly the umbilical hypogastric, right iliac, and occasionally the pelvic regions, and ter- minates in the right iliac fossa by opening into the inner side of the commence- ment of the large intestine. The ileum is narrower, its coats thinner and less vascular than those of the jejunum ; a given length of it weighing less than the same length of the jejunum.

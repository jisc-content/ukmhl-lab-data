391 INFERIOR MESENTERIC. lates with the ileo-colic; and an ascending branch, which anastomoses with tho cplica media. These branches form arches, from the convexity of which vessels are distributed to the ascending colon. The branches of i/his vessel are covered with peritoneum onj^on their anterior aspect. "^The colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and, passing forwards between the layers of the transverse meso-colon, divides into two branches : the one on the right side inosculating with the colica dextra; that on the left side, with the colica sinistraJ_jkJ)ranch of the inferior mesenteric. From the arches formed by their inosculation, branches are distributed to the transverse colon. The branches of this vessel lie between two layers of peritoneum. 225.â€”The Superior Mesenteric Artery and its Branches. Inferior Mesenteric Artery. (Fig. 226.) In order to expose this vessel, draw the small intestines and mesentery over to the ri<rht side of the abdomen, raise the transverse colon towards the thorax, and divide the peritoneum covering the left side of the aorta. The Inferior Mesenteric Artery supplies the descending and sigmoid-flexure of the colon, and the greater part of the rectum. It is smaller than the superior mesenteric ; and arises from the ^eft side of the aorta, between one and two indie's above its division into the common iliacs. It passes downwards to the left iliac fossa, and then descends, between the layers of the meso-rectum, into the pelvis,

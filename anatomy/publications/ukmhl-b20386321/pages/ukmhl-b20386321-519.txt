The anterior interosseous passes down the forearm on the anterior surface of the interosseous mem- brane, to which it is con- nected by a thin aponeur- otic arch. It is accom- panied by the interosseous branch of the median nerve, and overlapped by the con- tiguous margins of the %]Wnr prnfii Tiding—fligitn- , mm and Flexor Ion phis rmination, of terio/•Inferoseeo ii>a rio7' Carpal {nr. iV^LJ^al pollicis muscles, giving- off in this situation muscular branches, and the nutrient .arteries of the radius and ulna. At the upper border •of the Pronator quadratus, a branch descends in front of that muscle, to anasto- mose in front of the carpus with branches from the anterior carpal and deep palmar arch. The continu- ation of the artery passes behind the Pronator quad- ratus (fig. 221), and, pierc- ing the interosseous mem- brane, descends to the back of the wrist, where it an- astomoses with the poste- rior interosseous and the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. The anterior interosseous gives off a long, slender branch, which accompanies the median nerve, and gives offsets to its substance. This, the median artery, is some- times much enlarged. The posterior hiiero^coas artery passes backwards through the interval between

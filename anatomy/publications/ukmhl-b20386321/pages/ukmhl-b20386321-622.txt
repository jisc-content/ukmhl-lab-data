4§4 NERVOUS SYSTEM. optic thalamus. It passes, at first, backwards, outwards, and downwards, and then curves round the eras cerebri, forwards and inwards, nearly to the point of the middle lobe, close to the fissure of Sylvius. Its upper boundary is formed by the medullary substance of the middle lobe, and the under surface of the thalamus opticus. Its lower boundary, or floor, presents for examination the following parts : the hippocampus major, pes hippocampi, pes accessorius, corpus nmbriatum, choroid plexus, fascia dentata, transverse fissure. The hippocampus major, or cornu Ammonis, so called from its resemblance to a ram's horn, is a white eminence, of a curved elongate form, extending along the 26$.—The Fornix, Velum Interpositum, and Middle or Descending Cornu of the Lateral Ventricle. entire length of the floor of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle. At its lower extremity it becomes enlarged, and presents a number of rounded elevations with intervening depressions, which, from presenting some resemblance to the paw ot an animal, is called the pes hippocampi. If a transverse section is made through the hippocampus major, it will be seen that this eminence is the inner surface of the convolution of the corpus callosum, doubled upon itself like a horn, the white convex portion projecting into the cavity of the ventricle ; the grey portion being on the surface of the cerebrum, the edge of which, slightly indented, forms tho fascia dentata. The white matter of the hippocampus major is continuous through the corpus fimbriatum, with the fornix and corpus callosum. The pes accessorius, or eminentia collateralis, has been already mentioned, as

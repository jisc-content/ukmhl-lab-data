bciii GENERAL ANATOMY. Fig. XXVIII.—Transverse section of the grey substance of the spinal cord through the middle of the lumbar enlargement. On the left side of the groups of large cells are seen, on the right side, the course of the fibres without the cells. Magnified 13 diameters.—J. L. Clabke, del. fissure anterior columns. Within the grey sub- Fig. XXIX.—Longitudinal section of stance they run longitudinally upwards and downwards ; transversely through the posterior commissure to the opposite side; and into the anterior ccrnu of their own side. (Figs. XXVIII. XXIX.) The anterior roots are attached exclu- sively to the anterior column, or rather to the anterior part of the antero-lateral columns; for there is no antero-lateral fissure dividing the anterior from the lateral column. Within the grey substance the fibrils cross each other, and diverge in all directions, like the expanded hairs of a brush (Figs. XXVIII. XXIX.), some of them running more or less longitudinally upwards and downwards ; and others decus- sating those of the opposite side through the anterior commissure in front of the central canal. All the fibres of both roots of the nerves proceed through the white columns into the grey substance, with, perhaps, the exception of some which appear to run longitudinally in the posterior columns; but whether these latter fibres of the the white and grey substance of the spinal cord, through the middle of the lumbar enlargement.

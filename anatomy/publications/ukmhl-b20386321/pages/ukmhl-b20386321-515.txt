377 BRANCHES OF RADIAL. similar length ,en the inner margin of the Supinator longus. In this situation, the radial nerve lies in close relation with the outer side of the artery, and should, as well as the veine, be carefully avoided. In the lower third, the artery is easily secured by dividing the integument and fasciae in the interval between the tendons of the Supinator longus and Flexor carpi radialis muscles. The branches of the radial artery may be divided into three groups, corresponding with the three regions in which the vessel is situated. {Radial recurrent. Muscular. Superficialis volse.

The radial recurrent is given off immediately below the elbow. It ascends between the branches of the musculo- spiral nerve Supinator brevis the ancT"l;hen between the {Supinator longus ana jjrachialis anticus. sup- plying these muscles and the elbow-joint, and anastomosing with the terminal branches of the superior profunda. The muscular branches are distributed to the muscles on the radial side of the forearm. The superficialis voice arises 8u}l£rft^ai from the radial artery, just where this vessel is about to wind round the wrist. Run- ning forwards, it passes be- tween the muscles of the thumb, which it supplies, and sometimes anastomoses with the termination of the ulnar artery, completing- the super- ficial palmar arch. This ves- seTvaries considerably in size, usually it is very small, and terminates in the muscles of the thumb ; sometimes it is as large as the continuation of the radial. ■Beg/ hnticli <f Vliuur

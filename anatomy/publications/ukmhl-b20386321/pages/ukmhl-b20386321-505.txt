3^7 AXILLARY. .viz., the posterior thoracic or external respiratory nerve, descending on the surface of the Serratns magnns, to which it is distributed ; and perforating the npper and anterior part of this wall, the intercosto-lrumeral nerve or nerves, passing across the axilla to the inner side of the arm. The cavity of the axilla is filled by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, a large number of small arteries and veins, all of which are, however, of inconsiderable size, and numerous lymphatic glands ; these are from ten to twelve in number, and situated chiefly on the thoracic side, and lower and back part of this space. The student should attentively consider the relation of the vessels and nerves in the several parts of the axilla; for it not unfrequently happens that the surgeon is called upon to extirpate diseased glands, or to remove a tumour from this 217.â€”The Axillary Artery, and its Branches. situation. In performing such an operation, it will be necessary to proceed with much caution in the direction of the outer Wall and apex of the space, as here the axillary vessels will be in clanger of being wounded. Towards the posterior wall, it will be necessary to avoid the subscapular, dorsalis scapulae, and posterior circumflex vessels, and, along the anterior wall, the thoracic branches. It is only j along the inner or thoracic wall, and in the centre of the axillary cavity, that there are no vessels of any importance ; a fortunate circumstance, for it is in this situation more especially that tumours requiring removal are usually situated. The Axillary Artery. The axillary artery, the continuation of the subclavian, commences at the lower border of the first rib, and terminates at the lower border of the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major muscles, where it take3 the name of brachial. Its direction varies with the position of the limb : when the arm lies by the side

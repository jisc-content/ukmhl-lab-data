ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION. 26 humerus. This tendon consists of two laminae, placed one in front of the other, and usually blended together below. The anterior, the thicker, receives the cla- vicular and upper half of the sternal portion of the muscle ; the posterior lamina receiving the attachment of the lower half of the sternal portion. From this arrangement it results, that the fibres of the upper and middle portions of the muscle are inserted into the lower part of the bicipital ridge; those of the lower portion, into the upper part. The tendon, at its insertion, is connected with that of the Deltoid ; it sends up an expansion over the bicipital groove to the head of 169.—Muscles of the Chest and Front of the Arm.

By its anterior surface, with the Platysma, the mammary gland, the superficial fascia, and integument. By its posterior surface—its thoracic portion, with the sternum, the ribs and costal cartilages, the Subclavius, Pectoralis minor, Serratus magnus, and the Intercostals ; its axillary portion forms the anterior wall of the axillary space, and covers the axillary vessels and nerves. Its upper border lies parallel with the Deltoid, from which it is separated by the cephalic vein and descending branch of the thoracico-acromialis artery. Its lower border

INTERNAL PUDIC. 401 Relations. In the first part of its course, within the pelvis, it lies in front of the .Piriformis muscle and sacral plexus of nerves, and on the outer side of the rectum (on the left side). As it crosses the spine of the ischium, it is covered by the Gluteus maximus, and great sacro-sciatic ligament. In the pelvis, it lies on the outer side of the ischio-rectal fossa, upon the surface of the Obturator mternus muscle, contained in a fibrous canal formed by jfrfl nht.nrn.tnr foggfe and the falciform process of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. It is accompanied bv the pudic veins, and the internal pudic nerve. 229.â€”The Internal Pudic Artery and its Brandies. Peculiarities. The internal pudic is sometimes smaller than usual, or fails to give off one or two of its usual branches; in such cases, the deficiency is supplied by branches derived from an additional vessel, the accessory pudic, which generally arises from the pudic artery before its exit from the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and passes forwards near the base of the bladder, on the upper part of the prostate gland, to the perineum, where it gives off the branches, usually derived from the pudic artery. The deficiency most frequently met with, is that in which the internal pudic ends as the artery of the bulb; the artery of the corpus cavernosum and arteria dorsalis penis being derived from the accessory pudic. Or the pudic may ter- minate as the superficial perineal, the artery of the bulb being derived, with the other two branches, from the accessory vessel. The relation of the accessory pudic to the prostrate gland and urethra, is of the greatest interest in a surgical point of view, as this vessel is in danger of being wounded in the lateral operation of lithotomy. Branches. Within the pelvis, the internal pudic gives off several small branches which supply the muscles, sacral nerves, and pelvic viscera. In the perirmum the following branches are given off: D D

the deep plantar fascia, the strong central portion of which is attached to the large posterior tubercle, to the inner part of which the Flexor itself is attached. Abductor Pollicis has one of its origins from the inner part of the great tuberosity. Abductor Minimi arises from the front of both posterior tubercles. Flexor Accessorius has its larger and inner head arising from the inner surface of the Tuber Calcis, whilst its external head is attached to the plantar surface, a ittle in front of the external tubercle. No muscles are attached to the Processus anterior. The muscles just mentioned, especially the short Flexor and the Accessorius, are extended by dorsal flexion of the foot; from their origin they tend to draw the Tuber Calcis forwards and inwards, and this tendency meeting with but slight resistence from the weakened Tendo Achillis, would cause the Tuber Calcis to be depressed in its posterior part, and the Processus anterior forced more outwards and upwards by the tension on the inner and under surface of the bone. The different axis thus given to the Tuber Calcis. causes the horizontal and transverse position of the pos- terior facet; and as a consequence of the movement which this position, as we shall afterwards see, gives to the Posterior Talo-Calcaneal joint, arises the obliquity of the head and neck of the Talus, the horizontal position of its head, and the sagittal direction of the Sustentaculum Tali. The horizontal direction of the facet which articulates with the Scaphoid, gives the Scaphoid a more horizontal position, and, through it, influences the rest of the foot, the whole inner border being more raised. After birth the foot is no longer in extreme dorsal flexion, therefore the plantar flexors and Soleus are relaxed, but at the same time extension of the knee causes the Plantaris and Gastrocnemii to be stretched, so that instead

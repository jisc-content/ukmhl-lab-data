17 Meyer gives the axis of the under Astragaloid joint as running from the middle of the upper border of the head of the Talus, through the Sinus Tarsi, to the under posterior border of the Calcaneus, whilst that of the middle joint is nearly horizontal. The large oval facet, on the Calcaneus for the pos- terior Talo-Calcaneal joint is convex in its long diameter, but whilst the lower and outer part of the oval in its short diameter is perfectly Hat, the upper and inner varies, being in some cases slightly concave, in others convex. The facet lies obliquely forwards and downwards across the bone, its long diameter forming a mean vertical angle of 41Â°7 with the horizontal plane of the Calcaneus. As a basis for the measurement of the facet the line was taken from which its surface sinks on the one side forwards, down and out, and on the other backwards, down and in. At right angles to this line wax impres- sions were taken and the distance between noted. From the radii of the curves thus obtained and the distance between them, a cone could be constructed whose size is given in the following table. It is from a segment of this cone that the facet is formed. In the fcetus, impressions of the facet were not taken, as from the smallness of the facet, and want of firmness of the cartilage which causes even gentle pressure to alter the form, accuracy could not be expected, and it seemed also the less necessary because as Hueter points out, the segment of the cone surface on the facet is much more evident in the fcetus than in the adult.

35 It will be seen that in the adult the radius of the short diameter averaged only 74.7 per cent of that of the long, the facet is therefore part of a spheroid or elipsoid, and not part of a perfect sphere. But in the foetus it may be called a sphere, as fre- quently the two diameters were the same, and the average difference only amounted to 4.2 per cent, and this is in accordance with the change which Aeby * has shown generally takes place in the shoulder and hip joints of man and other mammalia; in the foetus their form is that of a perfect sphere, but with growth this regularity of form is gradually lost, until in the adult it is no longer a sphere but a spheroid or elipsoid. The facet of the adult has an obliquely transverse position on the head of the Talus, its outer part lying higher than the inner, the long diameter passing from the upper outer part, to the lower and inner, at an average angle with the horizontal plane of the bone of 41°.8. In the foetus, as Hueter has said, the facet is almost horizontal, the long diameter making an average angle ot only 10° with the horizontal plane. The point of rotation will be found from the radii of the diameters. The long diameter in the adult has an average radius of 19.3mm, the short of 14.3mm. In the foetus the two are so nearly alike, that that of the long, 5 3mrn, may be taken for both. These radii place the point of rotation in about the centre of the neck, and a line drawn from the centre of the surface of the facet, i. e. where the long and short diameters cross each other at right angles, through this point of rotation, has a course parallel with the sagittal axis of the Talus, from which it follows that the axis of rotation of the Talo-Scaphoid part of the Talo-Tarsal joint 1 Beitrage zur Kenntniss tier Gelenke.

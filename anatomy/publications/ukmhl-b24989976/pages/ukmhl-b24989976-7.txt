7 TALO-CRURAL JOINT. This joint connects the Tibia and Fibula with the Astragalus. The facet which governs the form of the joint is found on the superior and posterior surfaces of the body of the Astragalus. It is wider in front than behind from the converging of the lateral sides, concave from side to side, and convex from before backwards and has been described by Henke1 and Hueter2 as part of a cylinder with a radius of an inch. The following table shows that though sometimes part of a true cylindrical figure, more often the convexity is irregular, being greater in front than behind, whilst at the same time the radii of the internal and middle part of the facet are so constantly smaller than the external, that it seems justifiable to speak of it as being part of a cylindrical cone rather than as part of a cylinder. The radii rarely amount to an inch (3 cm.) but more nearly approach the 2 cm. spoken of by Henke as the radius of the depressed middle part of the facet. I have given but one radius for the convexity on the outer side because that convexity does not extend so far back as the inner and middle lines; being cut short by the small flattened triangular facet which lies between the posterior part of the superior facet and the external lateral facet which articulates with the external malleolus. 1 Anatomie und Mechanik der Gelenke 1863.

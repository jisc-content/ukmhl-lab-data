32 the Calcaneus and Talus, obliquely upwards, Forwards, and inwards, from the middle of the external surface of the Tuber Calcis, through the posterior part of the Sinus Tarsi, coming out on the inner surface of the neck of the Talus below the facet for the Internal Malleolus. The anterior joint lies almost entirely to the outside of this axis of rotation; it cannot therefore be formed from a second cone of the same size as the first, as this would not allow for as much movement as it possesses, but it may be part of a larger cone. In this way the two parts do not form a regular double joint, but the anterior forms a lateral arm secondary to the posterior part. In the foetus, from the more sagittal direction of the Sustentaculum Tali, the secondary cone is smaller than in the adult, so that the difference between the size of the two cones is not so great.

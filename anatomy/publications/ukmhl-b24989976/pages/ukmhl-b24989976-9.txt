9 The facet on the Tibia which corresponds with the superior facet of the Talus is wider in front than behind, convex from side to side, and concave from before back- ward; this concavity was about the same in all parts, there- fore the radius of the middle line is alone given. The elas- ticity of the ligaments uniting the fibula to the tibia allows the necessary widening of the posterior part when, with extreme dorsal flexion, it is brought forward over the wide part of the facet on the Astragalus; and the pre- sence of the small triangular facet on the external edge of the Astragalus is explained by the pressing on it of the pad formed by these ligaments, and the loose folds of synovial membrane, which are found between the Tibia and Fibula with the foot in dorsal extension, or in its right angled position. The internal side of the body of the Talus has a long narrow flat facet to articulate with the internal Malleolus; the external, a larger triangular one, flat from side to side, concave from above downward. The two Malleoli in articulating with these facets clasp the body of the Astragalus like the socket of a hinge. The extent of the joint surfaces given by Henke and Hueter was for the Astragaloid facet 120° Tibial facet 80° My measurements give about the same for the Astra- galus, namely 116°.4 as the mean number; but for the facet on the Tibia 70° appears to be nearer the usual extent than 80°. The axis of rotation of the Talo-crural joint must run from side to side in the frontal direction, because the primary movement is that of flexion and extension; if we use the radii of the curves of the superior facet on the Talus to find it, it will be found to pass from about the apex of the triangular facet for the external Malleolus

24 The Sustentaculum Tali makes an average angle with the sagittal axis of the calcaneus of 83°. 1, with the hori- zontal plane of 41."8, with the axis of rotation of the cone of 9S°.6. In the foetus the Tuber Calcis and Processus anterior have no common axis. The sagittal axis of the Processus anterior must be taken as that of the whole bone. It goes from a point slightly nearer the inner border of the posterior surface than in the adult, and passes through the bone, to the middle of the facet for the cuboid; the axis for the Tuber Calcis crosses this at an angle of 144°.6 obliquely, upwards and inwards.

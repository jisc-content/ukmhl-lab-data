would make with each other if produced till they cross, were found in the following way which has been pre- viously described by Piitz. 1 A sheet of paper was placed on the table, above this the prepared foot was fixed in the position it would have when resting on the ground; a string was then stretched over the foot in a line with the sagittal axis of the astragalus, and the line thus obtained was pro- jected on the paper below the foot. In the same way the transverse axis was taken, and the line parallel with the hollow of the Astragalo-Tibial Facet. The astragalus was then removed and the direction of the sagittal axis of the Calcaneus, Sustentaculum Tali, and axis of rotation of the Posterior facet for the Astragalus obtained in the same way. The angles formed by the crossing of these lines are the ones required. To find the vertical angles which the Talo-Calcaneal facet, and the Sustentaculum Tali made with the hori- zontal axis of the calcis, and that which the longest diameter of the Astragalo-seaphoid facet made with the transverse axis of the astragalus, the bones were placed so that the line of their axes should correspond with the level of the table on which they were, a straight wire was then fixed parallel with the direction of the facet to be measured, and the angle which this wire made with the table found by a quadrant. The movements of the joints were measured by the Goniometer constructed by Professor Aeby which has been described by F. Schmid.2 This instrument is a simple disk, on an upright support, divided into 360Â° and with a movable indicator fixed in its centre, one arm of which extends beyond its edge.

forming an angle with the sagittal axis of the Astragalus of 49°. 1 with the transverse axis of 35°.8. The table of the radii of the curves taken at right angles to this line shews that as a rule the curve is not part of one circle, but two, the smallest part being the posterior end, the two facets are not therefore perfectly congruent. This want of congruence is most general when the foot is in the middle position. In pronation the anterior and outer parts of the two facets are in close contact, whilst the posterior and inner are widely separated. In supination the congruence is almost complete, only slightly failing in the posterior part. In the adult the Tuber Calcis and Processus anterior have a common sagittal axis, which is the sagittal axis of the Calcaneus as a whole, and maj^ be described as passing through the bone from the centre of its posterior surface, where the rough part for the insertion of the Tendo Achillis joins the smooth part over which it glides, to come out about the centre of the facet for the cu- boid. This axis forms with the sagittal axis of the Astra- galus an average angle of 11°.9, with the transverse axis of 96°.9. The sagittal axis of the Astragalus is so nearly parallel with the hollow of the Talo crural facet that it may be said practically to be so. We have seen that the axis of rotation of the cone surface makes an angle with the sagittal axis of the Cal- caneus of 61° with that of the Astragalus of 49°. 1, and with the transverse axis of the latter of 35°.8. Whilst the facet has a vertical angle with the hori- zontal plane of the bone of 41°. 7, the axis of rotation crosses the facet from about the middle of its posterior and outer border, to the inner fourth of its anterior and inner border, nearly three quarters of the facet therefore falling below, and to the anterior and outer side of the axis of rotation.

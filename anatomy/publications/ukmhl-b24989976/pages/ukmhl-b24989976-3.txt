THE ANKLE JOINT OF MAN. Anatomists writing on the Ankle joint are found to differ considerably, not only as to the division of the joints forming the Ankle, but also as to the type on which the facets are formed, the direction of the axes, and the amount of movement permitted by the different parts. There seems room therefore for further examina- tion into the nature of the joint, especially as the me- thods of examining joints employed by Professor Aeby might be expected to give more accurate results than those previously obtained. At the same time it seemed well to make a similar examination of foetal feet, with regard to the great nor- * mal difference which according to Hueter 1 exists between the bones of the newborn and adult. The work was done at the Anatomical Institute of Berne under the direction of Professor Aeby, and I take this opportunity to thank him not only for the neces- sary material which he placed at my disposal, but also for the kind assistance through which alone the work was accomplished. The measurements were all made by 1 Anatomische Studien an de'n Extremitatengelenken Neu- geborner und Erwachsener. Virchow’s Archiv f. Pathol. Ana- tomie. Bd. 25. S. 5, 83.

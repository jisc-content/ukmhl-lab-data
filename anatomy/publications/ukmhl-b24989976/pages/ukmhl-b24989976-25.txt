The sagittal axis of the Astragalus and the hollow of the Talo-Crural facet are not parallel, as in the adult, but form an angle with each other of 21°. The angles given on the table show that the line parallel with the hollow of the facet, has about the same relation to the sagittal axis of the Calcaneus as in the adult, and that there is no difference of importance in the angles formed by this line, the transverse axis of the Astragalus, and the sagittal axis of the Calcaneus, with that of the axis of rotation of the cone surface; but on the other hand the sagittal axis of the Astragalus makes with the last an angle of 27°.l instead of 49°. 1. As the body of the Astragalus and its facets have the same direction in relation to the Calcaneus as in the adult, this dift'ei*ence in the sagittal axis of the bone will not originate in the body, but in the head and neck, which have an obliquity inwards in excess of that of the adult of about 19°. Although the axis of rotation of the posterior facet has the same direction with the sagittal axis of the Cal- caneus as in the adult, the facet itself has not, having an almost transverse and horizontal position on the Tuber Calcis. The axis of rotation crosses the facet from about the outer fifth of the posterior border, to the inner two fifths of the anterior, therefore only two fifths of the facet fall on the outer and anterior side of the axis of rota- tion, instead of three quarters as in the adult. The Sustentaculum Tali has a more sagittal and hori- zontal direction, forming with the sagittal axis of the Cal- caneus a mean angle of 24°.3. The posterior part has the same relative height with the posterior part of the axis of rotation of the cone surface, as in the adult, but from the horizontal position of the facet, not with the anterior part and rest of the facet. The posterior and inner part of the posterior facet sinks below the Susten- taculum, instead of the anterior and outer part.

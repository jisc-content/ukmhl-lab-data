19 Fig. 2. Adult (A, > 2 nat. Size) and Foetal (B, 2/i nat. Size) Astragalus. a o', Axis of rotation of articular cone. rO ci'2, Longitudinal Axis of sustentaculum. The oblique line (a) at right angles to which the impressions were taken, is the axis of rotation of the cone surface, this runs obliquely forwards and downwards from without in, at a mean angle with the sagittal axis of the Calcaneus of 61°, and with the horizontal plane of 12°.8. The posterior of the two impressions taken at right angles to the oblique line (a) will be the part of the base of the cone which lies on the facet, and from this the apex can be found, by measuring the height of the cone along the axis of rotation of the cone surface. The apex was found in this way to fall close to the posterior edge of the Sustentaculum Tali (a1), being some- times slightly within, that is beyond the Sustentaculum, at others slightly without, i. e. in the Sinus Tarsi.

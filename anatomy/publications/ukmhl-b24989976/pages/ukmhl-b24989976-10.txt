10 through the body of the bone, to come out on the internal side about live millimeters above the lower border of the neck of the Astragalus, and as much in front of the line at which the neck joins the body. The axis of rotation is parallel with the transverse axis of the body of the Talus. The accompanying table gives the angles of the Astragalus etc. in the adult and foetus. Fig. 1. A B Adult (A, â€˜a nat. Size) and Foetal (B, nat. Size) Astragalus and Calcaneus with their axes. a a. Line parallel with the transverse axis of rotation of Astragalus, b b. Sagittal axis of Astragalus. b'b1. Line parallel with hollow of Astragalo-Tibial Facet, c c. Sagittal axis of Calcaneus. From this table it will be seen that the transverse axis of the body of the Astragalus has the same relation in the adult and foetus to the line parallel with the de- pression in the facet of the Astragalus, and to the sa- gittal axis of the calcaneus, but while in the adult the depression in the Talus closely corresponds to the sagittal axis of the Astragalus, in the foetus they differ by a

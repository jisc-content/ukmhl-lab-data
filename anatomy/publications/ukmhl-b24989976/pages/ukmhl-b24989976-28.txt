28 of the Tuber Oalcis being dragged forwards and inwards, it is drawn upwards, and in this way a change in its axis is gradually caused which is the easier from its being so little ossified at the time of birth. The change of the horizontal and transverse position of the posterior facet would be further aided by the in- crease in height of the posterior part of the Tuber Oalcis, which would raise the posterior border, and thus throw the whole facet forwards and downwards as found in the adult. Hueter1 has given the movement of the Talo-Tarsal joint as being that of supination and pronation, and its extent as about 40° in both adult and foetus, saying lhat although supination in a foetus is greater than in an adult, pronation is less, it being hardly possible to pronate the foot beyond the horizontal position. He considers the cause of this difference to be the absence of check to supination, from the want of development of the Susten- taculum Tali, and the early check to pronation, which the greater relative height of the Processus anterior gives. A change in these surfaces he considers to be caused by the pressure of the weight of the body in walking and standing; but, as Volkman points out, this change occurs just as well in children who are obliged to lie still during the first years of their life, so that it is not enough to account for it. If the articulating facets of the posterior part cor- responded in their whole extent to a segment of the sur- face of the cone, the only movement possible between them would be simple rotation to and fro over its axis, and this rotation, as the axis is more sagittal than frontal, would give a movement of adduction and abduction; but the segment only occupies a part of fhe facet on the Calcaneus, whilst that on the Talus is not perfectly con- gruent, therefore the movement is not confined to that of 1 Klinik der Gelenkkrankheiteu.

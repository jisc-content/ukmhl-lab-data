12 mean angle of 21°. This difference being caused by the great obliquity inwards of the head and neck of the bone, and not in reality affecting the body of the Astragalus, it has no effect on the direction of movement of the Talo- crural joint. Henke, Hueter and Ludwig 1 say that the only mo- vement allowed by the Talo-crural joint is that of flexion and extension with a slight screw movement in right foot to left and left foot to right. Henle 2 and Quain3 say that, besides the flexion and extension, slight rotation is allowed when the foot is fully extended. The extent of the movement is given by Aebv as 60° Hueter » • 78° Henke » 90° Langer gives the movement of the whole ankle at 110°. In the following table, except in one adult and in the foetal feet, only the united flexion and extension of the whole ankle is given — and this it will be seen proved in the adult to be always less than the 78° given by Hueter, and on an average less than 60°, the mean number being 51°, whilst that of the foetus is greater than that of the adult, averaging 63°. As for these measurements all muscles were removed, the ligaments alone being left, they do not affect Hueter’s statement that the flexion and extension of the new born, from the check to flexion which the shortened dorsal ex- tensors cause, is less than in the adult, but only show that, when the influence of the muscles is excluded, the joint in the infant allows a greater extent of movement than in the adult. It may be noticed that the mean amount of move- ment (51°) closely corresponds to the average difference 1 Pbysiologie des Menschen. 1858. Bd. 1. S. 526. 2 Anatomie des Menschen. 1853 Bd. I. Theil 2.

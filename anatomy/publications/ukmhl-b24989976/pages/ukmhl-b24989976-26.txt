26 The Sinus Tarsi is wider than in the adult, the Pro- cessus anterior slightly longer and higher. From its greater height, and from the Processus being directed more upwards, the facet for the head of the Astragalus on its anterior part is as high as, and in some cases higher than, the facet of the Sust. Tali and posterior facet, having also a more sagittal direction. The cause of the change of form which takes place in the bones, is probably to be found in the different ac- tion of the muscles, inserted into the Calcaneus, before and after birth. The usual position of the fcetus, during the last months of foetal life is with the thighs flexed on the ab- domen, legs upon thighs, and feet in dorsal flexion. The Plantaris and the part of the Tendo Achillis formed by the Gastrocneraii having their origin from the femur are relaxed by flexion of the legs on the thighs, thus weakening the strength of the Tendo Achillis, whose resistance with that of the other plantar flexors, is over- come by the dorsal flexors which flex the foot more fully than is possible with the knee extended. The Plantaris, Soleus and Gastrocnemius, are the only muscles arising from the leg inserted into the Calcaneus; the first is inserted into the lower and inner part of the posterior surface, the other two, forming the Tendo Achillis, occupy the whole rough part of the posterior surface. From this insertion their action on the bone would be to draw the Tuber Calcis upwards and outwards from the posterior tubercle, in this way counteracting the in- fluence of the Flexor Brevis Digitorum, Flexor Accessorius, Abductor Pollicis Pedis and Abductor Minimi Digiti, whose origins are from the posterior tubercle and the in- ferior surface of the Tuber Calcis immediately in front of it. The Flexor Brevis would be the one which would have most influence, and this cannot be separated from

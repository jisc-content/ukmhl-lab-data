36 will cut that of the Talo-Calcaneous at an angle of 49Â°. 1 in the adult, and 27.1 in the foetus. The point of rotation of the Talo-Scaphoid joint is therefore eccentric in both cases to that of the Talo- Calcaneous, but this eccentricity is only half as great in the foetus as in the adult, and as the amount of supination and pronation in the Talo-Scaphoid joint depends upon the eccentricity of its point of rotation, the greater ec- centricity explains why in the adult almost the whole amount of supination and pronation can take place as a secondary movement in this part of the joint, instead of being, as in the foetus, part of the primary movement of the Talo-Calcaneous joint. As further evidence that the point of rotation has this position in the neck of the Talus, it may be mentioned that a point of rest, which in movement of the Talo- Tarsal joint is found in about the middle of the superior and inner surfaces of the neck, near the edge of the facet for the Scaphoid, corresponds to the point at which a line from the point of rotation, perpendicular to the axis of rotation, would leave the bone. In conclusion the points of difference between the adult and fcetus may be given shortly as consisting in the Calcaneus, of the different sagittal axis of the Tuber Calcis, and the want of development of its posterior part, from which arises the transverse and horizontal position oi the posterior facet, the more sagittal direction of the Sus- tentaculum Tali, and the greater proportional height of the Processus anterior. In the Astragalus, in the greater obliquity of the head and neck, which causes the sagittal axis of the bone to differ from the line parallel with the depression of the Talo-Crural facet, and in the globular form of its head, and the horizontal direction of the long diameter of the facet upon it for the Scaphoid. The fact that the transverse and horizontal position of the posterior facet allows the raising and depressing of

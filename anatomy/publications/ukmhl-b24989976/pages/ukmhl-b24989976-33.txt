33 TALO-NAVICULAR JOINT. This joint is formed by the head of the Tains and the hollow cuplike facet which receives it on the Scaphoid. The facet on the head of the Talus is said by Lud- wig 1 and Aeby 2 to be part of the surface of a sphere. Henke3 and Henle4 describe the head as not per- fectly round, as the curve of the transverse diameter is as a rule larger than that of the vertical. Hueter5 gives the head as part of a ball with its centre in the neck, but deviating in some parts from a perfectly round form, he also says that the oval for the Scaphoid in the foetus has an almost horizontal position, whilst in the adult it has an obliquity downwards from the outer side of about 45Â°. The facet on the Talus is oval and convex in both diameters, and is lengthened on the inner side by the part over which the inferior Calcaneo-Scaphoid Ligament glides. The radii given in the following table are of the curves of the long and short diameters of the facet which arti- culates with the Scaphoid, that with the ligament not being included. 1 Physiologie des Menschen. 1858.

37 the sides of the foot to take place in the foetus in the primary joint, instead of as in the adult principally in the secondary, explains the horizontal position of the facet for the Scaphoid, there being no occasion for supination and pronation to be increased by aid of the movements of the anterior part of the joint. But when the position of the posterior facet is changed by the gradual development of the Tuber Calcis, the free supination and pronation of the primary joint is lost, but is compensated in part by increased movement in the Talo-Scaphoid joint, which is permitted by the greater eccentricy of its point of rotation, and obliquity of direction of the long diameter of the facet for the Scaphoid, the change in the form of the head arising at the same time.

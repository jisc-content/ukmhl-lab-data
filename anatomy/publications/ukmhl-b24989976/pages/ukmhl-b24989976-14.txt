u (49°) between the size of the facets of the Talus and Tibia, an exact correspondence would not exist, because the depression in the neck of the astragalus in front of its facet, allows the facet of the Tibia to pass to a varying degree beyond the margin of the Astragaloid facet. The obliquity of this facet, to which Langer and Henke have attributed the slight screw movement existing in this joint, was borne out by these measurements, for in the adult the line of the depression in the Astragalo- Tibial facet made an angle with the transverse axis of the Astragalus of 85°.2 but in the foetus the obliquity does not exist, the two lines forming a right angle. The rotation mentioned by Henle and Quain when the foot was in full extension, was found in some cases, the fixed point being the external malleolus. When this rotation did not exist, without exception there was a compensatory mobility between the Tarsal and Metatarsal bones. In the foetus the rotation was found less often than in the adult.

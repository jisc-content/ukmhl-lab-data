31 ANTERIOR TALO-CALCANEOUS JOINT. Into this part of the joint enter the facets on the Sustentaculum Tali and the Processus anterior of the Calcaneus, and their corresponding facets on the head and neck of the Talus. The facet on the Sustentaculum is an oval with its long diameter in the sagittal direction; from side to side it is concave, from above down it varies, being sometimes slightly convex in its lower part, and concave in the upper, in other cases the convexity of the upper was stronger than in the lower, this convexity appearing to depend on the position of the apex of the cone of the posterior part, it being very marked when the apex fell on the inner side of the Sustentaculum Tali. The facet on the Processus anterior was small and unimportant as to form. The facet on the neck of the Talus to articulate with the Sustentaculum is concave in all directions, in its anterior part it is larger than its fellow, being widened on the outer side, so that when in pronation the Talus moves forwards and inwards on the Calcaneus, the two facets come into closer contact from this widened portion corresponding in form to the anterior and inner side of the Sustentaculum facet. As the anterior and posterior Talo-Calcaneal joints are formed from the same two bones, they must have a common axis of rotation, and this axis has been found by the measurements of the posterior part to run through

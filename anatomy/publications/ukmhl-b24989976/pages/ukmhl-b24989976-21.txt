21 The axis of the cone will have the same direction with regard to the sagittal axis of the calcaneus, as the axis of rotation of the surface. Its direction as regards the horizontal axis is to be found by deducting the angle which the surface of the cone makes with the horizontal axis of the calcaneus, from the angle at the apex of the cone enclosed between its axis and periphery. The above table gives the degrees of these angles, and from them it appears that the axis of the cone crosses the sagittal axis of the Calcaneus obliquely from the outer side, at a mean angle of 61° forwards and inwards, and 29°.5 upwards. As the posterior facet is formed out of a segment of this cone, the movement between the Calcaneus and Talus must be a rotation round its axis, and the axis of rota- tion of the two bones must have the same direction as that of the axis of the cone given above, and may there- fore be said to run from about the centre of the external surface of the Tuber calcis forwards, upwards, and in- wards, through the Sinus Tarsi, near the posterior border of the Sustentaculum, to come out at the inner side of the neck of the Astragalus, below the facet for the in- ternal Malleolus. The facet on the Astragalus articulating with the posterior part of the Talo-Calcaneal joint occupies the whole inferior surface of the body; it is oval and concave in its long diameter; in the short diameter either slightly concave or convex, according to the form of the facet with which it articulates; the long diameter does not correspond with the transverse diameter of the body, but crosses it from without inwards at about an angle of 35°. The line on this facet, which corresponds to the axis of rotation of the cone surface, passes from a point about one third from the posterior end of the outer border, to the point where the inner border joins the posterior,

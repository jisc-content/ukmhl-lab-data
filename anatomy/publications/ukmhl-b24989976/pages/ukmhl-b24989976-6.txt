calcis held the foot in such a way as not to interfere with the free movement of the joints. To measure the movement of the Talo-crural joint the foot was placed in extreme dorsal extension, the goniometer being in front of it, with the indicator parallel with the long axis of the Tibia. The degree marked by the indicator having been noted, the position of the foot was changed to that of extreme dorsal flexion and the indicator again brought parallel with the Tibia. The number of degrees between its first and last position gives the extent of movement possible for the joint. As by this method, there is room for some inaccuracy, to lessen it the mean result of four such measurements was taken in each case. In the case of one adult and all the fcetal feet a distinction was made between the degree of flexion of the Talo-crural joint, when the Talo-tarsal joint was fixed and when it was free. The movement of the Talo-tarsal joint was measured in the same way, the foot being first supinated while in extreme dorsal flexion. The movement between the Talus and Calcaneus and Scaphoid being first taken, with the anterior part of the foot fixed, then the anterior part of the foot was set free so as to obtain the whole amount of supination and pronation which the foot allows. Having explained the methods used, I will now go on to a more particular description of the separate joints forming the Ankle.

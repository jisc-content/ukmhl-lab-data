16 Henle gives this joint the form of a cylinder, with a radius of about 28mm, and an axis which runs from the posterior border of the outer surface to the anterior border of the inner surface, near its lower part, cutting the long axis of the foot at an angle of about d0°. Henke describes the posterior facet on the Calcaneus, as formed from a flat cone whose point falls in the inner end of the Sinus Tarsi. Meyer and Aeby say that the under Astragaloid joint is formed by an obliquely placed double cone whose point is in the Sinus Tarsi. Langer and Hueter say that the posterior facet on the Calcaneus is formed from the segment of a cone whose apex Hueter places in the Sinus Tarsi, and this I believe to be correct. Henke, Aeby, Ludwig and Hueter give a common axis for the posterior and anterior joints. This axis Henke gives as beginning on the upper rough surface of the head of the Talus, a little to the inner side, and passing in a sagittal direction downwards and backwards, at about equal angles with the horizontal and perpendicular planes of the foot. Ludwig describes it as directed from below, behind and out, to above, forwards and in. Aeby, as passing forwards and upward at an angle of 45°. Hueter, as running from the outer border of the in- sertion of the Achilles Tendon in front of the Susten- taculum Tali, in the neighbourhood of the Sinus Tarsi, through the body and neck of the Talus, to the inner part of the neck above the facet for the Scaphoid. Langer says the axis of the posterior and anterior joints are in essentially the same direction, though not exactly identical, that of the posterior ascending obliquely from about where the Lig. Calc.-Fibulare is inserted in the Calcis to the insertion of the Lig. Navic. Dorsale.

29 adduction and abduction, but a further movement of the Talus is permitted, from which arises the raising and depressing of the borders of the foot, and this double movement of the Talo-Tarsal joint is best expressed by supination and pronation. In the adult, if the anterior part of the foot is held so that no independent movement takes place in the Talo- Seaphoid, Calcaneo-Cuboid and Tarsal joints, the inner and outer borders of the foot can be but slightly raised thus showing that the movement which takes place in the Talo-Calcaneal part of the Talo-Tarsal joint, when that of the Talo-Scaphoid is excluded, is nearly confined to adduction and abduction. In the foetus on the other hand the borders of the foot are raised and depressed almost as freely when the movement of the anterior part is excluded, as when it is free. The movement found in each case is given in the table ; for the adult it will be noticed that it does not amount on an average to half that given by Hueter, but in the foetus it does, being almost twice as great as was found in the adult. This excess of movement was largely due to the increased supination, which I should explain rather by the transverse position of the Posterior facet, and the conse- quent altered relation of the surface of the facet to the axis of the cone, than to the want of development of the Sustentaculum Tali. â€¢' X fv / ;> A T.f 0

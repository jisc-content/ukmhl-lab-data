DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. 104 radius and ulna. On the radial side of that extensor the tendons groove the radius in the order stated; and on the ulnar side, one muscle (ext. carpi ulnaris) is lodged in a hollow on the ulna. The dorsal interosseous muscles, 0, arising from the metacarpal bones bounding each space, are pierced behind by vessels—the external one by the radial trunk, and the others, by the per- forating branches irom the deep palmar arch. The attachments and the action of these muscles are described with Plate X. ARTERIES OF THE BACK OF THE HAND. About the wrist, and on the back of the hand, the arteries are derived from the radial and interosseous vessels, and from the deep palmar arch. Above the wrist only superficial branches of the interosseous vessels appear. a. Radial artery. h. Posterior carpal branch. c. Metacarpal branch. d. Dorsal branch of the thumb and the index finger. /. Dorsal interosseous arteries. g. Branch of the posterior inter- osseous artery. li. Posterior part of the anterior interosseous arterj'. k. Ofiset of the recun-ent inter- osseous artery. 11 f Cutaneous offsets of the pos- terior interosseous artery. The radial artery, a, corresponding with the dorsal artery of the foot in the lower hmb, winds over the carpal bones and enters the hand through the first interosseous space. Its connections are the following:— In addition to the common investments of the limb, with superficial veins and nerves, the three extensors of the thumb are directed over it;—two, viz., extensor of the metacarpal bone, K, and of the first phalanx, L, lie close together, and in a line with the styloid process of the radius ; and the other, the extensor of the second phalanx, N, crosses close to the spot where it enters the palm of the hand. Beneath the arteiy are the carpus and the external lateral ligament of the wrist-joint. Small veins, and ramifications of the external cutaneous nerve, accompany the artery.

DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. 180 ceding, and is concealed by the external pterygoid : it is delineated in Plate xxi., 1. A third small artery, /, which has not been described by Anato- mists, runs with the gustatory nerve, and supplies the cheek, and the floor of the mouth external to the tongue. The second set of brandies is distributed to the muscles of mas- tication as below :â€” The deep temporal, g, two in number, enter the fore and hinder parts of their muscle. The masseteric branch, s, springs in com- mon with the posterior temporal, and enters the hinder border of the masseter: it has been cut in the removal of the muscle. The buccal branch, h, descends to the cheek and the buccinator muscle: it anastomoses with the facial artery. Branches to the pterygoid muscle are shown in Plate xxi. Third set of branches. Only one of these branches, the posterior dental, h, is seen in the dissection. It takes a tortuous course to the front of the upper jaw, where it communicates with the infra- orbital : it will be given more fully in Plate xxiii. The facial artery, n, also a branch of the external carotid (Plate xvii.), is displayed as it crosses the jaw. It ascends with a wavy course to the root of the nose, passing near the comer of the mouth. Named branches .supply the lips and the nose, and one of these to the lower part of the face is the inferior labial, r. Unnamed branches ramify in the cheek, and anastomose with the buccal and transverse facial arteries. MAXILLARY AND FACIAL VEINS. rVM^T-^f. (^External jugula^ vein. Supei-ficial temporal. Internal maxillary vein. X. Facial vein. s. Deep facia], or anterior internal maxillary. The facial vein, x, begins near where the companion artery ceases, and crosses the face to the jaw; but it takes almost a straight line from the root of the nose to the front of the masseter muscle, and does not follow the windings of the facial artery. It ends in the neck in the internal jugular trunk.

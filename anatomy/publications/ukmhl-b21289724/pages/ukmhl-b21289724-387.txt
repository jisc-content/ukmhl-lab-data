365 ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. knee : it is tlien contimicd fclirougli the leg to the foot. For two- thirds of its extent in the thigh it accompanies the femoral vessels, crossing over them from the outer to the inner side, and lying under the aponeurotic layer over them ; but beyond the opening in the adductor magnus the superficial branch, i, of the anasto- motic arteiy runs with it. One or two branches are furnished by the nerve:â€”an occasional offset, 8, communicates with the internal cutaneous nerve ; and a large patellar branch, 14, pierces the sartorius to ramify in the teguments over the knee (p. 353). The deep set of dranches of the anterior crural are furnished to muscles ; they supply the extensors of the knee-joint, and the sartorius and pectineus. The branch to the sartorius, 8, has been separated fi'om its muscle ; oftentimes an offset of the middle cutaneous enters the sartorius. The nerve to the rectus, 9, has been cut through as it pene- trates the muscular fibres. The nerve to the vastus internus, 11, pierces the fleshy fibres about the middle of the thigh. As it is about to enter it gives a slender articular branch, 12, to the knee-joint, which runs on the surface of the vastus, covered at places by some fleshy fibres, and accompanies lower down the anastomotic artery to the joint. In this body a second articular branch issues from the fleshy fibres nearer the knee. The nerve to the vastus externus, 10, will be described with the following Plate. The nerves to the pectineus, 2, one or two in number, arise higher than the rest, and cross beneath the femoral vessels to be distributed to the muscle : for their ending, see Plate XLVi. Obturator nerve, 15. A small part of this nerve is included in the dissection, but its distribution is visible in Plate xlvii., with which it will be described.

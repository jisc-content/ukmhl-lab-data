NERVES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. 165 It joins freely with the sensory fifth nerve, and furnishes offsets also to the integuments ; and as it supplies alone the posterior belly of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoideus, it must confer on . them sensibility as well as motion. The hypoglossal nerve, 14, is a motor nerve of the tongue. Descending through the neck with the great bloodvessels till it comes below the digastric muscle, it is then directed forwards over the carotids to the submaxillary region: it will be continued in Plate xxii. As it crosses the vessels it supplies two oflfeets :â€”one, descendens noni, 3, enters the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone, after joining with the spinal nerves (Plate xxiv.) ; the other, much smaller, ends in the thyro-hyoideus, F. Branches of the vagus. Two branches of this nerve, viz., the upper laryngeal, 1, and the external laryngeal, 2, (an offset of the first) are furnished to the larynx ; their distribution will be referred to more fully in the description' of the Plate of the larynx. Branches of the fifth nerve. The auriculo-terrvporal, 11, is a sensory nerve, and ascends with the temporal artery to the side and top of the head : it supplies the ear with the attrahent muscle, and the parotid gland. The mylo-hyoid branch, 12, lies below the jaw, and ends in the anterior belly of the digastricus, and the mylo-hyoideus : contractility and sensibility are given to those muscles by the nerve. The great auricular nerve, 10, of the cervical plexus is dis- played in Plate xvi. In this Figure the communicating branches, 9, through the parotid to the facial nerve are brought into view.

141 LIGATURE OF TPIE SUUCLAVIAN. 'trunk and branches wonld lie in the centre of an incision to reach the artery: this position of the vein may so interfere with the access to the artery as to render expedient division of the vein, and ligature of the ends. Sleps of the operalion of ligature. Taking the most prominent part of the clavicle as the superficial guide to the position of the artery, draw down the loose skin of the neck, and cut for two inches and a half along the clavicle—the line of the vessel mark- ing the centre of the cut—so as to divide on the bone the skin, the fat and the platysma, and the superficial nerves and vessels.* Let this cut be next moved rather above the clavicle ; and let the operator divide the deep fascia, and find his way vertically down- wards to the artery, looking out for tlie intermuscular interval between the trapezius and sterno-mastoideus, and for that between the omo-hyoideus and clavicle, and incising any muscular fibres which interfere with his progress. After the muscles have been passed the surgeon proceeds cautiously, not letting the knife pass beneath the clavicle to wound the supra-scapular vessels or the sub- clavian vein, and using at this stage the outer, rather than the inner part of the wound. Towards the inner end of the incision the external jugular vein with branches will soon be met with ; and it may be either drawn inwards, or divided and tied, accord- ing to the impediment it offers to reaching the artery. To find the artery in the bottom of the wound, look to the outer end for the firm and white cords of the brachial plexus, which serve as the deep guide; and when these are recognised the artery will be found lower down, i.e. between them and the first rib.f After the artery, has been laid bare by the removal of some fat and a slight sheath, the aneurism needle should be entered in the outer angle of the wound, where the handle can * If such, a superficial vessel as that marked d, in the Drawing, should arise from the suhclavian tnink, division of it at this stage would be followed by considerable heemorrhage, and ligature of it would jjiobably be needed before the operation could be continued. t The projection or tubercle on the first rib, at the attachment of the anterior scalenus muscle, is said by some authors to serve as the deep guide to the vessel, but this eminence is seldom prominent enough to be felt by the finger.

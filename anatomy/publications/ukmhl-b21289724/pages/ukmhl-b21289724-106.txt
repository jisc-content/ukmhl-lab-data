84 DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM. The median nerve, 1, courses between the superficial and deep layers of muscles, till about two inches above the wrist where it approaches the surface (Plate viii.). It distributes nerves to all the superjficial muscles except the flexor carpi ulnaris, and offsets of its interosseous b]-anch supply the deep muscles. Muscular offsets may be seen entering the pronator teres, D, the palmaris longus, and flexor carpi radialis, F, and the flexor sublimis, J, The anterior interosseous Iranch, 2, runs on the front of the interosseous membrane, with the artery of the same name, between or in the fibres of the flexors of the digits, and ends below in the pronator quadratus, P. It supplies the outer half of the flexor digitorum profundus, and the whole of each of the other two deep muscles, viz., flexor poUicis, and pronator quadratus. The cutaneous palmar Iraiich, 7, arises near the wrist: it is described with Plate viii. The ulnar nerve, 3, is directed through the forearm along the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, in the position of a line from the inner condyle of the humerus to the pisiform bone. Branches are supplied to one muscle and a half Articular filaments. Behind the elbow one or two slender twigs are furnished to the joint. Muscular offsets. One or two nerves, 4, enter the flexor carpi ulnaris; and one, 5, belongs to the inner half of the flexor digitorum profundus. The palmar cutaneous Iranch, 6, is conveyed along the lower half or third of the ulnar artery to the integuments of the palm of the hand: it sends offsets around the artery, and com- municates with the palmar branch of the median nerve at its ending.

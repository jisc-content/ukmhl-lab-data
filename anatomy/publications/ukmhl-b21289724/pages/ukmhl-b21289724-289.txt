267 SECOND LAYER OF THE GROIN. The ilio-inguinal nerve, 1, is a branch of the lumber plexus. Ifc courses through the parietes of the abdomen as far as the external abdominal ring, through which it issues to supply the integuments of the scrotum or of the labium, and of the contiguous part of the thigh, like its companion artery. The ilio-hijpogastric nerve, 2, arises with the preceding from the lumber plexus, and passing with it through the wall of the abdo- men, ends near the pubes in the integuments of the hypogastric region : further back it gives a cutaneous iliac branch over the crest of the hip bone. Dorsal nerves. The lower six of these nerves are partly con- tained in the wall of the abdomen : they perforate the external oblique tendon, like the two preceding, and ramify in the tegu- ments near the middle line of the body. More posteriorly they furnish also lateral cutaneous branches to the side of the abdomen. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXIII. The internal oblique muscle vsdth the cremaster is depicted in this Figure. This dissection of the second layer of the groin will be com- pleted by cutting through and reflecting the obliquus externus in the manner shown, and by removing from the fibres of the internal oblique the thin intermuscular layer of areolar tissue. The nerves and small vessels will be defined as the areolar tissue is cleared away. SECOND LAYER OF THE GROIN. Two muscles enter into the second stratum of the groin: of these the chief one is the internal oblique, and to it the cremaster is connected below.

122 DISSECTION? OF THE ORBIT. the elevatiou of the lid is checked by the mucous membrane which is then less loose. B^cti muscles. The upper rectus, R, (attollens oculi) and the outer rectus, S, (abductor oculi) have a common origin with the other two recti, around the optic nerve, at the apex of the orbital cavity; and they are inserted into the eyeball about a quarter of an inch behind the cornea. The outer rectus is provided with an additional origin from a point of bone on the lower edge of the sphenoidal fissure, near the inner end of that slit: between this head and the common one the ophthalmic vein and several nerves pass. The pupil is directed upwards and inwards by the upper rectus muscle, and outwards by the other rectus—the insertion of the muscles into the ball in front of its greatest transverse diameter impressing on the eye the movements stated. Squinting upwards or outwards may result from permanent contraction of the muscle moving the eye in the direction indicated, or from the rectus in action being unbalanced through paralysis of its antagonist muscle or muscles. VESSELS OF THE ORBIT. The ophthalmic artery and vein are represented in the left orbit. These vessels have some peculiarities:—they are not transmitted through the same aperture in the bone ; and the vein, which is a single trunk, ends in the cavernous sinus in the interior of the skull. d. Ophthalmic artery. e. Anterior ethmoidal or nasal artery. /. Posterior ethmoidal artery. g. Suprn-orbitiil arteiy. h. Ophthalmic veiu. The- ophthalmic artery, d, is a branch of the internal carotid, and enters the orbit through the optic foramen, lying below and outside the optic nerve. In the left orbit the artery is shown coursing over the optic nerve, and along the inner side to the fo'ont of the cavity, where it ends in branches for the root of the nose (nasal) and the forehead (frontal). Most of its offsets are distributed in the orbit.

SOME MUSCLES OF THE FACE. ]91 Other branches, sometimes called roots, join with the surround- ing nerves, like the communicating branches of the lenticular ganglion. Thus the ganglion is connected above with the gus- tatory—a sensory nerve; with the facial—a motor nerve, by means of the chorda tympani (p. 185), which runs by the side of the gustatory to the tongue, and gives a slender thread to the back of the ganglion; and with the sympathetic through the plexus of that nerve on the facial artery. DESCRIPTIOxN OF PLATE XXIII. In this dissection the second trunk of the fifth nerve, and a part of the internal maxillary artery, are brought into view. Supposing the head and the orbit opened, the dissection will be completed by removing the outer wall of the orbit, and the side of the cranium forming part of the middle fossa of the base of the skull. SOME MUSCLES OF THE FACE. Some of - the muscles of the eyelids and upper lip being partly displayed will be referred to shortly ; the other muscles, viz., those of mastication, have received sufficient notice already. A. External pterygoid muscle. B. Masseter muscle. C. Buccinator muscle. D. Levator anguli oris. E. Levator labii superioris. F. Levator lab. sup. alteque nasi. G. Orbicularis palpebranim. H. Eectus oculi superior, j I. Antrum maxillare. I Ij. Obliquus oculi iuferior. Orbicularis palpebrarum, G. This thin sphincter muscle occu- pies the eyelids, forming loops around their aperture, and extends beyond the margin of the orbital cavity. When the fibres contract the lids are closed, the upper one

DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 450 MUSCLES OF THE FOURTH LAYER. In the last layer of the sole of the foot are included the inter- ossei, and the tendons of insertion of the tibialis posticus and peroneus longus. When the same letters are used in the Figures The interossei muscles are seven in number, and fill the intervals between the metatarsal bones. Two are lodged in each inter- metatarsal space, except in the inner where there is only one ; and they are attached to the bones bounding laterally the spaces: they are arranged into a plantar and a dorsal set. The plantar set, X, three in number, are slender fleshy slips, which lie in the three outer spaces, and arise each from a single metatarsal bone, viz., fifth, fourth, and third. Opposite the meta- tarso-phalangeal joint each becomes tendinous, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of its toe; a slip is prolonged from it to join the extensor tendons on the dorsum of the phalanx. The dorsal set, Z, are four in number, one being placed in each of the intermetatarsal spaces. Each has a double origin laterally from the two metatarsal bones between which it is lodged. An- teriorly they end in tendons, which are inserted, like the plantar muscles, into the fibular side of the fourth and third toes, and into both sides of the second toe: they join also the extensor tendons on the dorsum. All the muscles are visible in the sole of the foot, where they are covered by fascia, by the external plantar nerve, and the plantar arch and its branches: near the toes the transversalis pedis and the transverse metatarsal ligament lie on them. On the dorsum of the foot only the dorsal set appear ; and they are pierced behind by arteries passing from the one aspect of the foot to the other. they point to the same parts. M. V. w. Y.

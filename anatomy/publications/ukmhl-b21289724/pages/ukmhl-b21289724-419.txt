NERVES OF THE BUTTOCE. 397 Bmnclm of the sacral jJlexus. These nerves have been referred to in the preccdmg PLate, but some of them are more fully dis- played in this deeper dissection. The thigh-lranclm are the small and largo sciatic nerves. The branches of the former have been cut across, and are marked with 6. The larger nerve is pointed out by the number 12. pudic ov jwincecd nerve, 10, is du-cctedover the small sacro- sciatic ligament to the perinasum, and is accompanied by the pudic artery and the nerve to the obturator internus. Branches to external rotators. All the external rotators, except the obturator externus, obtain nerves from the sacral plexus. The obturator internus receives the nerve, 9, at its inner or pelvic aspect. To the upper gemellus the slender nerve, 7, is distributed; it enters the superficial surface. Two nerves enter the pyriformis at the under surface, but these are not visible until the muscle has been cut and reflected. The quadratus and inferior gemellus are supplied by the nerve, 8, which passes beneath the upper gemellus and the obturator internus, and pierces the under surface of the quadratus near the upper border. As the nerve crosses under the inferior gemellus it sends an offset to that muscle ; and as it lies on the capsule of the hip-joint, fine filaments penetrate that membrane to end in the synovial sac. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LI. —♦—- The popliteal space or the ham, with its contents, is delineated in this Figure. For the dissection of the ham the skin and the deep fascia are to be reflected by a median incision, terminated by a cross cut at each end. The large quantity of fat, which then comes into view, is to be removed with care ; for articular vessels and nerves, and other nerves and arteries to muscles, cross through the deeper region of the hollow. On the side of the artery some lymphatic glands are to be separated from the surrounding fat.

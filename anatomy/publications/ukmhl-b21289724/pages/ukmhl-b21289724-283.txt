ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE ABDOxMEN. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXIL —H A SURFACE view of the lower part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, with the superficial fascia, vessels, and nerves of the groin. The skin being reflected from the groin by a triangular flap, as indicated in the Drawing, the fatty layer containing the vessels comes into sight; and this with its vessels may be thrown towards the thigh, like the skin, after it has been examined. Underneath it appears a thin fibrous layer, H, which may be detached from the aponeurosis of the subjacent muscle as far as the thigh. The tendon of the oblique muscle may then be cleaned with little trouble. SUPEEFICIAL STRATA, VESSELS, AND GLANDS. Between the skin in the groin and the subjacent muscles two superficial layers are interposed. One is in contact with the cutis, and contains the fat; the other, thin and membranous, rests on the tendon of the external oblique muscle. The more subcutaneous fatty layer, called the superficial fascia, varies in thickness here as elsewhere with the obesity of the body. In it ramify superficial vessels from the femoral artery, with veins; and as the stratum is separated fi'om the subjacent one by a line of glands at the top of the thigh, it can be easily raised and thrown downwards, as in the Figure. The deeper stratum, H, thin and translucent, is destitute of fat, and is known as the aponeurosis of the fascia lata (Scarpa), ♦

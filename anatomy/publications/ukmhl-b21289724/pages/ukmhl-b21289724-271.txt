FORE PART OF THE PEUINyKUM. 249 Within a distance of three inches from the anus the gut may- be cut, where disease renders an operation necessary, without fear of passing the limits of the peringeum, and entering the cavity of the pelvis. Should the lower end of the rectum be removed the sphincters and levator ani would be destroyed, and an mability to control" the passing of the feces would necessarily follow such an operation. DESCKIPTION OF PLATE XXX. The superficial fascia, with muscles, vessels, and nerves of the anterior half of the peringeum, are delineated in this Figure. Supposing this dissection follows that in Plate xxix., it may be executed by raising laterally the skin by means of a central longi- tudinal incision from the scrotum to a transverse cut in front of the anus. For the reflection of the subcutaneous fatty layer air should be blown beneath it, on each side, by means of a blow- pipe inserted through it at the fore part of the ischio-rectal fossa]; and then an incision should be made through the fat along the track of the air. On the left side tln-ow outwards the fatty layer to show its hinder and lateral attachments, and a membraniform layer on the under surface ; but the part extending on to the thigh may be taken away down to the fascia lata, as in the Drawing. On the right side the superficial perinteal vessels and nerves are to be traced out as the superficial fascia is reflected. When the fatty layer has been examined it may be partly removed on both sides for the display of the muscles. ANTERIOR PART OF THE PERIMUM. This part of the perinseal space is placed anterior to a line half an inch in front of the anus. It lodges the tube of the urethra,

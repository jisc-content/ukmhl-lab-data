ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PERlNi^UM. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXIX. —♦— This Figure illustrates the dissection of the posterior part of the perinasiira. Boundaries of the pennccim.—The perinjeal space corresponds with the outlet of the pelvis. It is limited in front by the sym- physis pubis ; behind by the tip of the coccyx with the great gluteal muscles ; and on each side by the pubic arch, and by the great sacro-sciatic ligament covered by the gluteus. Depth.—The periuteum reaches into the pelvis as far as the recto-vesical fascia, which forms the partition between the peri- nseum and the pelvic cavity (Plate xxxix.) ; and as this septal piece of fascia is directed obliquely downwards and inwards the measurements to it fi'om the surface of the body will vary at dif- ferent spots. In front near the pubes the depth of the space is about an inch, but it amounts behind to three inches by the side of the rectunj. Division into two.—In this region as above defined are con- tained in the male the excretory tubes for the feces and urine. A transverse line half an inch in fi'ontof the anus divides it into two, viz., a posterior or rectal, and an anterior or urethral part. POSTERIOR PART OF THE PERINyEUH. In the hinder part of the perina3um lies the rectum, but as the gut'does not occupy all the space between the bones, there is a hollow on each side, the ischio-rectal fossa, which is filled with B

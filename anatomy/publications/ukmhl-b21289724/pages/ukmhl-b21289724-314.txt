DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 292 The spermatic artery, c, a branch of the aorta, courses to the testis through the internal abdominal ring. The veins accom- panying it unite together higher in the abdomen (Plate xxxvi.). The obturator artery, g, arises from the internal iliac trunk in the pelvis, and issues through the subpubic aperture to the thigh. Its companion vein, k, and nerve, 4, have a like course. The nerves in the dissection are offsets of the lumbar plexus, and are represented more fully in the two following Plates. 1. Genital branch of genito-crural. 2. Crural branch, of genito-crural. 3. External cutaiieous nerve. 4. Obturator nerve. The genito-crural nerve divides into two :â€”The genital branch, 1, runs on the external ihac artery, and issues through the in- ternal abdominal ring to supply the cremaster muscle ; the crural branch, 2, passes beneath Poupart's ligament to the integuments of the thigh. The external cutaneous, 3, is directed under the outer end of Poupart's ligament to the teguments of the thigh. The obturator nerve, 4, escapes ft'om the abdomen by the sub- pubic hole with the vessels of the same name, above which it lies: it is distributed in the thigh. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXVI. The deep muscles and the vessels of the abdominal cavity are figured in this Plate. The objects here represented will be readily cleaned after the removal of the viscera from the cavity of the abdomen ; but as the large vein (vena cava) is imbedded in the substance of the liver it is usually cut away in the removal of that viscus. To denude the diaphragm, dissect off with care the peritoneum ; to remove that membrane from the tendon of the muscle, to which

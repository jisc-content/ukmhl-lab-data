P 1- Branches of upper hasmo- rrhoidal arteryi Internal iliac artery, b. This large trunk furnishes visceral and parietal branches in the pelvis, as before said, p. 396 ; but only the arteries to the viscera are delineated in this Plate. Common visceral branches. The arteries which have the same name and general distribution in the male and female are the vesical and hemorrhoidal. The vesical arteries, two in number, upper, d, and lower, c, are distributed to the regions of the bladder indicated by their names. The middle hcemorrhoidal artery, g, ramifies in the wall of the rectum, below the recto-uterine pouch of the peritoneum : part of it has been cut off. The upper hcemorrhoidal is derived from the aorta in both sexes, and its distribution is referred to in page 329. Three of its branches, o, p, q, are shown on the lower part of the rectum, coursing down to pierce the muscular coat, and end in loops within it. Special visceral branches. Three arteries are furnished to the generative organs of the female, viz., the uterine, the vaginal, and the ovarian, but only the two first are branches of the internal iliac. The uterine artery,/, is the largest visceral branch of the iliac trunk, and is remarkable in being very tortuous on the womb. At first it is directed forwards beneath the peritoneum to the neck of the uterus ; at this spot it ascends along the side to the fundus of that viscus, where it ends. Many large serpentine branches are distributed from it to the uterus, and it communicates above with the ovarian artery. Near the cervix uteri it gives some branches to the upper part of the vagina. z

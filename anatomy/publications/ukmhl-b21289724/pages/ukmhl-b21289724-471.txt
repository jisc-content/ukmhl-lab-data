EXTERNAL PLANTAR ARTERY. 449 transversalis pedis) obtain their nerves from the external plantar. The external plantar artery, c, crosses the sole of the foot with its nerve, to form the plantar arch. Digital and muscular branches arise from the arch : the former of these and the trunk â€¢will be delineated in Fig. ii.; and the latter, which enter the neighbouring muscles, are visible in this stage. Each of the two external lumbricales receives an arterial twig; and there is sometimes another branch for the second lumbricalis muscle, as in this dissection. The transversalis pedis is supplied on the under surface by one or more of the subjacent digital arteries. For the interossei of the three outer spaces offsets are derived from the digital arteries and the arch (Fig. ii,). Branches to the adductor poUicis penetrate the fibres at the under surface, like the nerves. From the most external digital artery proceed branches for the flexor brevis minimi digiti. Veins. The companion veins of the plantar arch and its branches were purposely removed in the dissection, to render the Figure less comphcated. Figure II. The fourth stage of the dissection of the foot is depicted in this Figure. By cutting across and removing the adductor and part of the flexor brevis pollicis the plantar arch will be laid bare; and by removing the transversalis pedis and the transverse metatarsal ligament beneath it, and passing the scalpel backwards for a short distance in the centre of the three outer intermetatarsal spaces the interossei muscles will be defined. On the removal of some areolar tissue from the hinder part of the sole, the insertion of the tibialis posticus, the tendon of the peroneus lougus, some liga- ments of the foot, and small deep anastomotic vessels come into sight.

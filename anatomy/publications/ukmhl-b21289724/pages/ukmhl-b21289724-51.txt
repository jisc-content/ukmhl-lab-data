BICEPS MUSCLE AND THE FASCIA OF THE ARM. 29 LYMPHATIC GLANDS IN THE AXILLA. One of the highest of the group of lymphatic glands by the side of the axillary vessels is shown in position on the side of the chest. Two small lymphatic vessels ascend from it, and pierce the inner side of the axillary sheath to join tlie deep lymphatics of the neck. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE III. A DISSECTION of the superficial veins and nerves in front of the bend of the elbow is represented in this Plate, for the purpose of illustrating the operation of blood-letting. For the dissection a longitudinal incision was carried over the middle of the joint, and was limited by a transverse cut at each end. On reflecting the two flaps of skin, the subcutaneous vessels- and nerves will be found in the fat. A piece of the deep fascia should be raised, as may be seen in the drawing, to show the position of the deep artery and nerve. BICEPS MUSCLE AND THE FASCIA OF THE ARM. The deep fascia of the limb deserves special attention, as it is the only protecting layer between the cutaneous veins and the main artery of the arm. A. Biceps muscle. B. Deep or special fascia of the arm. C. Piece of the deep fascia re- flected. D. Inner intermuscular septum. F. Projection of the inner condyle of the humerus. I. Intermuscular space on the front of the forearm. Biceps muscle, A. At its lower end the muscle diminishes in size, and becoming tendinous, is fixed into the radius. Higher in the arm it gives rise to the well-known prominence, with a groove or hollow on each side lodging the superficial veins of the arm, viz., the basilic, h, on the inside, and the cephalic, h, on

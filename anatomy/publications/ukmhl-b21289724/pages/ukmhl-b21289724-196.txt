174 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. This muscle extends the head, and brings the face to its own side by moving the atlas round the odontoid process of the axis. Rectus 'posticus minor, H, arises from the arch of the atlas, close to the middle line; and is inserted into the inner half of the lower curved line of the occipital bone. The muscle extends the head. ARTERIES OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. Three arteries supply the back of the neck, and connect the vessels of the head with those of the trunk. In the neighbour- hood of the thorax small offsets of the dorsal arteries appear. a. Occipital arteiy. h. Deep cervical branch of the occi- pital. c. Ofl'set to the small rectus muscle. d. Vertebral arteiy. e. Cervical branch of the vertebral. /. Anastomosis of the vertebral and deep cer\-ical arteries. g. Deep cervical artery. h. Dorsal arteries â€” the inner branches. The occipital artery, a, courses to the integuments of the back of the head over the obliquus superior and the complexus, and beneath the sterno-mastoideus, the splenius, and the trachelo- mastoideus : near the middle line it pierces the trapezius. It furnishes a cervical branch, l, to the neck (ram. princeps cervicis), which descends beneath, the complexus, B, supplying the deep muscles, and anastomoses with branches of the vertebral and deep cervical arteries. An offset passes over the complexus, and supplies the superficial muscles. The vertebral artery, d, in its course to the interior of the skull is directed backwards in a groove on the neural arch of the atlas. Lying deeply in the bottom of the hollow between the large rectus and the oblique muscles, it furnishes one or two muscular offsets, e, and communicates with the contiguous arteries. The deep cervical artery, g, is the dorsal offset of the upper intercostal (p. 170), and reaches the back of the neck by passing

MUSCLES OF MASTICATION. 177 MIISCr.KS OF MASTICATION". The muscles employed in mastication are attached chiefly to the angle and processes at the back of the lower jaw ; but one, which occupies the check, blends with the lip-muscles. A. Temporal musole. B. External pterygoid muscle. C. Internal pterygoid muscle. D. Buccinator muscle. F. Masseter muscle. G. Digastric muscle (posterior belly^. H. Stylo-Iiyoideus. L. Stylo-glossus. N. Internal lateral ligament. 0. Styloid process. P. Duct of the parotid gland. The temporal muscle, A, arises from the temporal fossa on the side of the skull, and from the upper part of the temporal fascia; and the fibres couverge to a tendon which is attached to the under surface of the coronoid process, and to the groove along the fore part of the ramus of the jaw. Comparatively superficial above, the muscle passes below beneath the zygomatic arch and the masseter muscle, and rests on the ex- ternal pterygoid, B. Near the zygoma a stratum of fat intervenes between the fleshy fibres and the temporal fascia. In mastication this muscle crushes the food by raising the lower jaw; and if the jaw has been moved forwards, the hinder fibres may be able to bring that bone backwards, with the aid of the muscles attached to the chin. The masseter muscle, F, is placed external to the ramus of the jaw. It takes origin from the lower border and the inner sin'face of the zygomatic arch ; and it is inserted into the outer surface of the ramus of the jaw, from the tip of the coronoid process to the angle, and as far forwards as the second molar tooth. The superficial fibres take a direction down and back across the deeper and straighter fibres. This muscle is the external elevator of the angle of the jaw. The internal pterygoiA muscle, C, has a position inside the ramus of the jaw similar to that of the masseter outside. The

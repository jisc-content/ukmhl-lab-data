DEEP MUSCLES OF THE URETHRA. 257 parts are enclosed. Near the base of the ligament, and directed transverselj-- towards the urethra, are the deep transverse muscle, J, and the constrictor urethrÂ£e, H.; and under these, near the middle line and below the tube of the urethra, lies Oowper's gland. Along the side of the ligament, where it is fixed to the bone, the pudic artery is situate : this sends inwards near the base of the ligament a transverse branch to the bulb. And by the side of the artery, but deeper than it, and contained in a separate tube of fascia, is the pudic nerve. MUSCLES OF THE MEMBRANOUS PART OF THE URETHRA. Between the layers of the triangular ligament two muscles are included, viz. deep transverse, and the constrictor urethraj. The other muscles in the Drawing have been already noticed in the description of the two foregoing Plates. A. Sphincter ani extermis. B. Levator ani. C. Bulb of the iirethi-a. D. Ejaculator uriute, cut. E. Gluteus maximus. F. Erector penis. G. Crus penis, cut. H. Constrictor urethras. J. Deep transverse muscle. K. Triangular ligameut of the urethra. The deep transverse muscle, J, is a narrow fleshy slip which lies along the base of the triangular ligament, nearly beneath the superficial transverse muscle. Externally it arises from the pubic arch ; and internally it joins below the urethra the muscle of the opposite side, and is fixed into the central point of the peringeum. This muscle is not always separate from the fol- lowing. The muscle acts like the superficial transverse in fixing the central point of the peringeum, and drawing it backwards towards the rectum. Constrictor urethrce, H. This muscle extends transversely from the pubic arch to the urethra, and unites on that tube with its fellow. The two muscles taken together resemble the sphincter ani externus placed transversely. It has a tendinous origin from the pubic arch and from the posterior layer of the triangular ligament ; and it divides near the s

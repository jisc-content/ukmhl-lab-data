DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. 382 sciatic ligament. From this attachment the coarse bundles of fibres are directed downwards and outwards, and becoming ten- dinous are inserted into the fascia lata and the femurâ€”about the upiDer two thirds joining the fascia, and the rest the bone. The precise insertion is made evident in Plate lii., where the muscle is partly cut through and reflected. This gluteus is covered by the fascia lata and teguments ; and it is in contact by the deep surface with the parts displayed in Plate XLix. Its upper border, the shortest, is crossed by cuta- neous vessels and nerves, and rests on the gluteus medius ; whilst the lower border forms part of the ischio-rectal fossa, and lies over the adductor magnus and the hamstring muscles. Eound the lower border wind branches of the small sciatic nerve with their accompanying vessels. If the femur is immoveable the muscles of both sides will assist in balancing the pelvis on the thigh-bones, as in standing ; and if the pelvis is bent forwards, as in stooping to the ground, the large glutei will act powerfully in bringing the trunk into the erect position. In rising from the sitting to the upright posture, these muscles are chiefly active, becoming extensors of the hip-joints. In standing on one leg, say the right, the trunk will be rotated on its bony prop, so as to have the face tm-ned to the left side. If the thigh-bone is free to move, the muscle will rotate out the femur, and will then abduct, and carry back that bone so as to extend the hip-joint. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLIX. The second stage of the Dissection of the buttock is depicted in this Figure. The view here given may be obtained by cutting vertically through the gluteus maximus near the pelvic attachment, and removing carefully all the fat from the underlying muscles, vessels,

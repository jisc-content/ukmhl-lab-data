462 DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. longed to the external cuneiform, the cuboid, and the third and fourth metatarsal bones ; and a fourth, M, is reflected bacliwards to be fixed into the os calcis. In short, the tendon is attached to all the tarsal bones except the astragalus ; and to the metatarsal bones with the exception of those of the great and the little toe. DEEP VESSELS OF THE SOLE. Both tibial vessels end in the sole of the footâ€”the anterior passing through the first interosseous space, and the posterior entering at the inner side of the heel; and both furnish digital arteries to the toes. c. External plantar trunk. d. Digital branch of outside of little toe. e. Digital branch of inside of great tee. /. Digital branch of first and second toes, g*. Digital branch of second and third toes. h. Digital branch of third and fourth toes. i. Digital branch of fourth and fifth toea. I. Dorsal artery of the foot. n. Artery of the great toe. 0. Communicating branch to deep arch. The plantar arch is the curved terminal part of the external plantar artery, c. Its extent is limited by the base of the little toe in one direction, and the back of the first interosseous space in the other. Internally it joins the dorsal artery of the foot (anterior tibial) by means of the communicating branch, o, so as to establish a direct inosculation between the main vessels on the fore and hinder aspects of the leg. In this course it crosses three of the metatarsal bones near their tarsal ends, and rests on most of the interossei muscles. At the outer part it is covered by the flexor perforans and the lumbricales, and at the inner, by the adductor pollicis. Companion veins lie on its sides, and the external plantar nerve curves in a similar way just behind it. From the convexity or anterior part of the arch proceed digital arteries, and from the concavity arise perforating and small nutri- tive branches.

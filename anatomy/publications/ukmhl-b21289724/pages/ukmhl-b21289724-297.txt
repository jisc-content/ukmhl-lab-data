EXTERNAL INGUINAL HERNIA. 270 in the abdominal wall it gives rise to an incomplete hernia, or a groin tumour (bubonocele). Diagnosis.—In distinguishing the external or oblique from the internal hernia the greatest assistance will be derived from the direction and form of the tumour. When it is small, and is still confined to the abdominal parietcs, its recognition will be ensured by the swelling taking the direction of the inguinal canal, and leading to the internal abdominal ring where the neck of the tumour sinks into the abdomen; and even an aperture may be recognised with the tip of the finger when the intestine has been pushed back. After the rupture has passed beyond the bounds of the abdominal wall the swelling becomes flask-shaped with the large end towards the scrotum, and with a narrow neck running upwards and outwards in the groin to the position of the internal abdominal ring. With the aid of the fore finger the hernia may be ascertained to lie in front of and rather to the outer side of the spermatic cord; but this diagnostic mark is not so easy to detect as the oblique position in the groin. The diagnosis is not to be made however under the following circumstances:— When the hernia is large and of long standing the weight of it draws inwards the movable internal abdominal ring into a line with the external ring, obliterating by that movement the obliquity of the inguinal canal, and causing the external hernia to have a straight course, and the appearance of an in- ternal hernia. Taxis.—The success of attempts to replace a piece of intestine in the cavity of the abdomen will depend mainly upon the mani- pulator keeping in remembrance the direction of the inguinal canal, and the influence of the position of the limb upon the tightness of the structures in the groin. Before the taxis is em- ployed the recumbent posture is required, and the thigh is to be raised and rotated in, so that the apertures through which the gut escapes, and all the strata in the groin, may be relaxed as much as possible. To effect the reduction the operator grasps the end of the tumour with one hand, using gradual and uniform pressure over the surface, whilst with the two fore fingers of the other hand he endeavours to direct upwards through the narrowed neck of T 2

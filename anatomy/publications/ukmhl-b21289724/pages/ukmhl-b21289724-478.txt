456 DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE LEG. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LVIII. -f- The dissection of the front of the leg and dorsum of the foot appears in this Illustration. In preparing the dissection divide the skin along the centre of the limb, and reflect it to the sides by means of a cross cut at each end, and a third opposite the ankle. After search has been made for the cutaneous nerves and vessels in the fat, the fascia may be taken away to show the muscles and the deeper vessels and nerves ; but in executing this step the two parts of the anterior annular ligament are to be defined and left, as in the Plate. On the dorsum of the foot is the arch in which the saphenous veins begin. The small arteries ramifying on the surface of the leg and foot are derived fi-om the anterior tibial trunk. c. External saphenous. The venous arch, a, on the dorsum of the foot, answers to a similar arch on the back of the hand. Contained in the sub^ ciitaneous fat, it is placed anterior to the tarsus. Its convexity is turjied towards the toes, aud is joined by small digital veins ; and at its concavity open small superficial, with some deep veins, d. At each end the arch is continued into a saphenous vein. The internal sa^Jmious vein, b, begins at the inner end of the dorsal arch, and ascending to the leg in front of the inner ankle crosses obliquely the tibia: its further course in the leg behind that bone is manifest in Plate JjY. The external sajilienous vein, c, springs from the confluence of CUTANEOUS VEINS AND ARTERIES. a. Venous arch of the foot. b. Internal saphenous. d. Communicating veins. p. Venae comites.

ARTEKIES OP THE FOREARM. 73 tlie space, the musculo-spiral nerve may be found dividing in front of the condyle of the humerus into radial and posterior inter- osseous branches. Loose fat fills the hollow, supporting the vessels and nerves, and extends into the forearm along the bloodvessels; and blood effused beneath the fascia finds its way along the same channels. A few lymphatic glands with their connecting vessels accompany the arteriesâ€”two or three lying on the sides of the brachial, and one below its point of splitting. From the lax condition of the parts surrounding the brachial artery pressure applied to the vessel, when wounded, should be firm and gi-aduated. The limb too should be kept still; for when the elbow is moved much the vessel may slip away from the com- pressing pad, and blood may be effused beneath the fascia. ARTERIES OF THE FOREARM. Two chief vessels occupy the front of the forearm, and these spring from the division of the brachial trunk. They are named radial and ulnar from their position in the limb ; and both reach the palm of the hand, where they form arches and supply branches to the fingers. Both are placed deeper near the elbow than at the wrist. a. Anastomotic branch of the hrachial trunk. h. End of the brachial artery, c, d.

Cutaneous median vein, joining a deep companion vein. The radial artery, f, is the more external of the two blood- vessels in the forearm, and inclines from the bifurcation of the brachial trunk to the lower end of the radius; it then winds to the back of the wrist below the radius, and enters the hand. The part from the wrist onwards will be included in other dissec- tions (Plates X. and xi.). A line from the centre of the elbow-joint

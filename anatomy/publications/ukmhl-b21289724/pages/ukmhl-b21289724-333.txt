311 CORD OF THE SYMPATHETIC. different spinal nerves. As the viscera have been removed from the abdomen only the knotted cords remain. The lumbar part of the gangliated cord, 21, lies along the inner border of the psoas muscle, and is covered on the right side by the vena cava inferior. A ganglion exists, for the most part, opposite each vertebra ; and from it offsets are prolonged in- ternally and externally. The external branches, two in number from each ganglion, join generally two spinal nerves. The internal branches are directed over the aorta, and terminate in the large visceral plexuses. The sacral part of the cord, 22, rests on the front of the sacrum internal to the row of apertures. Below, the cords of opposite sides are connected by a loop in front of the coccyx, on which there is situate a single median ganglionâ€”the " ganglion impar." The number of the ganglia is oftentimes less than that of the vertebrse; and those bodies are smaller in the pelvis than else- where. External and internal offsets are given from these as from the lumbar ganglia. External branches, two in number, enter either one or two spinal nerves. Internal or visceral brcmches, small in size, are continued fi'om the first two ganglia to the nerve-centre in fi'ont of the sacrum, called the hypogastric plexus; the branches fi'om the remaining ganglia ramify on the front of the sacrum, and form a plexus on the middle sacral artery. Splanchnic nerves. These are three in number on each side, and take origin in the ganglia of the knotted cord of the sympa- thetic in the thorax. They are named large, small, and smallest, and pierce the fibres of the crus of the diaphragm. The large splanchnic, 10, ends in one of the ganglia (semi- lunar), forming part of the solar plexus in the abdomen. 18. Great splanchnip nerve. 19. Small splanchnic. 20. Smallest splanclinic. 21. Lumbar part of the gangliated cord. 22. Sacral part of the cord.

170 DISSECTION OF THE SUBCLAVIAN EEGION. 3. The internal mammary, n, arises opposite the vertebral and beneath the jugular vein: it enters the thorax through the upper oi)ening, and is continued to the wall of the abdomen. 4. The superior intercostal (intercosto-cervical) arises under the scalenus: it supplies offsets to tlie upper two intercostal spaces; and a large branch to the back of the neck (deep cervical), which is delineated in Plate xix. The veins of the arm and of the same side of the neck meet at the top of the thorax, and blend in one large trunkâ€”the inno- minate: the limb vein is called subclavian, and the neck veins jugular. The subclavian vein, p, is rather shorter than its corresponding artery, and ends near the inner border of the scalenus by joining the internal jugular to form the innominate trunk. Arched like the artery, it is placed in front of the scalenus, and commonly below the level of the clavicle. Valves exist in the trunk outside the place of entrance of the external jugular, s. The veins joining it are the external and anterior jugular, and the vertebral. At the back of the vein, near the internal jugular, the right lymphatic duct opens; and at a similar spot on the left side the thoracic duct is received. External and anterior jugular veins. The ending of these veins is seen in this Plate, and their course is described in p. 143. The external jugular, r, receives the transverse cervical branch, t, and the supra-scapular, w, and joins the subclavian vein outside the scalenus anticus. The anterior jugular, v, enters either the sub- clavian vein or the external jugular: when this vein is tributary to the external jugular it wants valves (Strutliers). Internal jugular vein, r. The lower dilatation of the vein is SUBCLAVIAN AND JUGULAK VEINS. p. Subclavian vein. r. Internal jugular vein. s. External jugular vein. t. Transverse cervical vein. V. Anterior jugular vein. w.

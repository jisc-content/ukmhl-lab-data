419 MUSCLES OF THE CALF OF THE LEG. tendon, the subjacent muscles, vessels, and nerves, will Be diS' played as soon as the fat and areolar tissue have been removed. The deeper muscles of the calf, viz., the soleus and plantar is, cover the bones of the leg; and above these, at the back of the knee-joint, lies the popliteusâ€”one of the deep layer of muscles. The jjZawtem, Q, possesses a short rounded belly, fi'om three to four inches long, and a narrow, slender tendon, the longest in the body. The muscle arises by fleshy fibres from the outer condyloid ridge-of the femur, above the attachment of the outer head of the gastrocnemius. Opposite the upper edge of the soleus the fibres end in the tendon, which is prolonged between the gastrocnemius and soleus and along the tendo Achillis, to be inserted into the back of the os calcis at the inner side of, or with that tendon. At its origin the muscle appears inside the external head of the gastrocnemius, and forms part of the outer boundary of the popliteal space. As far as half way down the leg it is covered by the gastrocnemius; but where this muscle ends in a tendon the plantaris becomes cutaneous, and then lies along the inner border of the tendo Achillis. Its action though slight is similar to that of the gastrocne- mius, for if the foot is unsupported it will extend the ankle ; or, the foot being fixed, it will help to bend the knee, as in stooping. The sohus, J, the deepest muscle of the calf, is named from its flattened and widened form. It is attached to both bones of the leg, viz., to the head and upper third (sometimes half) of the posterior surface of the fibula, to the oblique line across the posterior surface of the tibia, as well as to the middle third of MUSCLES OF THE CALF OF THE LEG.

PROFUNDA VESSELS, 375 the femur. The psoas, B, becomes tendinous below, and is inserted into the small trochanter of the femur. The iliacus, D, joins by some fleshy fibres the outer part of the psoas tendon, but the rest ai'e continued to the femur, and are inserted into a special surface in front of, and below the small trochanter. The two muscles cover the hip-joint, and the front of the hip- bone between the iliac crest and the ilio-pubic eminence : a large bursa separates the psoas from the joint; and a smaller one inter- venes between the iliacus and the anterior margin of the bone. On the psoas lies the femoral artery ; and between the two muscles the anterior crural nerve is imbedded. Internally are placed the adductor muscles with the internal circumflex vessels ; and externally, are the extensor of the knee-joint, and branches of the external circumflex vessels. These muscles flex the hip-joint, and advance the femur in front of the trunk in making a step. After the joint is flexed, they bring forward the small trochanter, and so rotate out the femur : their action on the spinal column is given before in p. 296. Obturator externus, N. The origin of the muscle appears with the adductors, and the insertion with the muscles of the buttock. It arises from the outer surface of the anterior half of the obtu- rator membrane, and from the contiguous part of the hip-bone; and its tendon, which is directed backwards below the hip-joint, is inserted into the pit at the root of the great trochanter. The muscle acts as an external rotator when the femur hangs and is free to move ; but its fuller action on that bone and the pelvis will be detailed more specially with the anatomy of the external rotators. PROFUNDA VESSELS OF THE THIGH. The large profunda artery is the chief nutritive vessel of the thigh; and it maintains anastomoses with arteries of the buttock and leg when the femoral trunk has been rendered impervious to the blood by ligature or other cause.

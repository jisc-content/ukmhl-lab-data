DEEP NERVES OF THE FORE PART. 371 Ending of superior gluteal nerve, 1. This glutoal nerve is distributed nearly altogether to the two smaller gluteal muscles, and it ends anteriorly, as here seen, iu the tensor of the fascia lata. A branch of the gluteal artery accompanies the nerve. Anterior crural nerve, 2. The deep or muscular branches of this nerve are furnished to the triceps extensor, the sartorius, and to one other muscle, the pectineus. Branches to rectus and sartorius, 3, 3. Each enters its muscle at the upper part; they were cut when the muscles were removed. Branch to the vastus externus, 4. This is a large nerve, which enters the muscle above the middle : from it a slender articular offset is prolonged on the surface of the vastus, with a superficial artery, to the capsule of the knee-joint, which it pierces. The branches to the vastus interaus are two in number. The upper one, 5, is supplied to the fleshy fibres of that part some- times named crureus ; and the lower branch, 6, which is figured in the preceding Plate, belongs to the inner part of the vastus internus and to the inner side of the knee-joint. Nerve to the pectineus, 8. This branch separates from the trunk of the anterior crural near Poupart's ligament, and passes beneath the femoral vessels to enter the pectineus on the super- ficial surface. Oftentimes there are two nerves instead of one. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLVII. —♦— In this Illustration the dissection of the deeper adductor muscles, with the profunda artery and obturator nerve, is exhibited. The superficial adductors having been laid bare as in Plate XLV., the pectineus and adductor longus are to be cut through ; and after removing the greater part of each of those muscles, the deeper adductors, and the ramifications of the profunda artery and obturator nerve are to be cleaned.

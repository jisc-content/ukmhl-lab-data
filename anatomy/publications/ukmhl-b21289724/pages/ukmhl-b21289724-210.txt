188 DISSECTION OF THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. lies beneath the hyo-glossus, and gives attachment to the middle constrictor, Gr. Sometimes this band is large and cartilaginous or even osseous ; at other times it is slight, and so membranous as not to be recognised. The Pharynx. In front of the carotid blood vessels is the upper dilated part of the gullet, or the pharynx. Its wall contains thin muscles vrhich overlap one another, and the chief of these are called constrictors : two are marked with G and J, but they will be more fully noticed in Plate xxv. SALIVARY GLANDS. The sublingual gland and parts of the submaxillary and parotid, are exposed in the dissection. R. Sublingual gland. | T. Part of the parotid. S. Piece of tlie submaxillary. t Wharton's duct. Submaxillary gland, S. A deep part of the gland projects beneath the mylo-hyoid muscle, and with it the following excre- tory duct is connected :â€” The duct of the gland, j-, (Wharton's,) is about two inches long ; it ascends beneath the gustatory nerve and tlie sublingual gland to the floor of the mouth, and ends in an eminence on the side of the frtenum linguge. The suUingical gland., R, lies under the fore part of the tongue, where it forms a prominence, but it is separated from the cavity of the mouth by the mucous membrane. Elongated from before back, it is about one inch and a half in length, and meets its fellow in front. Its ducts are numerous (8 to 20), and open for the most part by separate orifices in the floor of the mouth, but some join the duct of the submaxillary gland. LINGUAL VESSELS. The vessels of the tongue ai-e few in number, in comparison with the nerves, there being but one on each side.

NERVES OF THE PELVIS. arc three, as in the Phite, they have the undermentioned distri- bution. The upper vesical, h, is the smallest, and accompanies the obli- terated hypogastric, of which it appears to be a pervious part, as far as the top of the bladder : its offsets are few, and incon- siderable in size. The middle vesical, y, supplies the body of the bladder, and communicates with the other arteries of that viscus. The inferior vesical, d, ramifies in the fundus of the bladder, and gives branches to the vesicula seminalis, B, and the prostate, L. Usually it furnishes an offset to the rectum (middle hgemo- rrhoidal), but in this body the gut was not supplied by it. On the prostate the branches become tortuous. Eccmorrlioidal arteries. The rectum is provided with vessels from three sources : â€” upper haemorrhoidal, i; middle hasmo- rrhoidal fi'om the internal iliac (Plate xli, g); and inferior hfEmoiThoidal ft'om the pudic artery (Plate xxix. V). The uppei' hcemorrJioiclal, i, is the termination of the inferior mesenteric trunk. Placed at first at the back of the rectum, it divides into six or seven branches about the middle of the gut: these descend around the intestine, three being marked, j, Tc, I, and pierce the muscular coat about three inches from the anus. Inside that coat the branches are continued nearly to the anus, where they communicate together in a series of loops beneath the mucous membrane. The vein accompanying the artery has a similar looped arrange- ment of its branches within the anus ; and these loops projected through the anus, but altered in their structure and use, form ha3morrhoids (p. 242). NERVES OF THE PELVIS. Both spinal and sympathetic nerves are distributed in the pelvis. 1. Vesical nerves, 2. Nerve to levator ani. 3. Nerve to coccygcus. 4. Sacral plexus, cut. 5. Left part of hypogastric plexus. 6. Part of the pelvic plexus. 7. Offsets of the knotted cord of the sympathetic to hypo- gastric plexus.

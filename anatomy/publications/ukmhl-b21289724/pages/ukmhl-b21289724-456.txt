431 DISSECTION OF TPIE SOLE OF THE FOOT. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LVI. Views of the first two dissections of the sole of the foot are represented in the Figures of this Plate. Figure I. In this Illustration the dissection of the first layer of muscles with the superficial vessels and nerves is displayed. After the removal of the skin, the cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be sought; and when the fat and the subjacent plantar fascia have been taken away, the first layer of muscles comes into sight. The digital nerves and vessels, appearing between the muscles about the middle (in length) of the foot, are next to be traced onwards to the toes. FIRST LAYER OF MUSCLES. Three muscles enter into this layer :â€”the central one is the short flexor of the toes ; the muscle in a line with the great toe is the abductor pollicis; and that lying along the outer border of the foot is the abductor minimi digiti. A. Abductor pollicis. B. Flexor brevis digitoriim. C. Abductor minimi digiti. E. Flexor tendou of the gi-eat toe. H. Lumbricales. K. Transverse ligament of the toes. N. Flexor brevis pollicis. 0. Flexor minimi digiti. P. Interossei of the outer space. The flexor brevis digUorum, B, acts on the four outer toes ; and it is called flexor perforatus from its tendons being pierced by those of the long flexor. The muscle has a narrow origin pos- teriorly frorti the inner side of the large tubercle at the back of the OS calcis, and from the investing plantar fascia. About the middle of the foot it is divided into four fleshy parts, the outer being very small ; and from each part proceeds a tendon to the

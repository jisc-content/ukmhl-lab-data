308 DISSECTION OP THE ABDOMEN, the thorax, and ends in the neck by joining the left subclavian vein. The ilio-vertebral ligament, I, stretches between the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra and the iliac crest of the hip-' bone, opposite the hinder part of the iliac fossa: from the upper and posterior part the quadratus lumborura F takes origin, and fi'om the front, the iliaous. SPINAL NERVES IN THE ABDOMEN. The anterior primaiy branches of the lumbar and sacral nerves are united into a large plexus along the side of the spinal column. After this union several branches are distributed to the limb ; the crural offsets fi-om the upper part belong to the front of the limb, and those from the lower part of the plexus enter the back of the thigh. 1. First lumbar nerve. 2. Second himbar. 3. Third lumbar. 4. Fourth lumbar. 5. Fifth lumbar. 6. Ilio-hypogastric branch. 7. Ilio-iiiguinal branch. 8. Geuito-crural branch. 9. External cutaneous. 10. Anterior crural. 11. Obturatornerve. 12. First sacral nerve. 13. Second sacral. 14. Third sacral. 15. Fourth sacral. 16. Superior gluteal branch. 17. Last dorsal nerve. 23. Branch to hmibo-sacral. 24. Lumbo-sacral cord. 25. Sacral plexus. The lumlar nerves are five in number, and are marked 1, 2, 3, &c. They increase rapidly in size from the first to the last; and they communicate with each other, and with the knotted cord of the sympathetic, as soon as they escape from the intervertebral foramina. Small muscular offsets are furnished by the nerves to the psoas and quadratus. Four of the nerves unite in the lumbar plexus, whilst the last or fifth enters the sacral plexus. Sometimes too the last dorsal is joined to the first lumbar by a small branch (dorsi-lumbar). The lumlar plexus is formed by the intercommunication of the four highest nerves; and it is embedded in the large psoas muscle. â– Below, it is connected with the sacral plexus through the lurabo-

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXI. , This Illustration of the deep dissection of the pterygoid region exhibits the third trunk of the fifth cranial nerve, and the deep branches of the internal maxillary artery. In preparing the dissection the internal maxillary artery should be cut through, and the condyle of the jaw having been disarti- culated should be drawn forwards with the external pterygoid muscle. After the removal of the fat the nerves and vessels wiU be ready for learning. The muscles described with Plate xx. are met with again in this view, and they are marked with the same letters of reference. A better idea of the wide origin of the external pteiygoid is obtained in this Plate. The meninsreal and the muscular branches of the internal maxillary artery, which wei'e hidden in Plate xx., are now brought under notice ; and the other arteries, which are the same as in the preceding Figure, are marked by the same letters.

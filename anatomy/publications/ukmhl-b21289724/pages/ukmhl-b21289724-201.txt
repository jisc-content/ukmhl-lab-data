179 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. In playing a wind instrument this muscle is flattened, and tlie fibres arc contracted for the purpose of driving the outgoing air throuo-h the channel of the mouth ; but in the use of a blow- pipe the muscle is distended because the mouth is used as a reser- voir, but the fibres contract at the same time, to maintain a con- tinuous and active current of air. INTERNAL ]^[AXILLARY ARTERY. The chief vessel in this dissection is the internal maxillary artery, which is continued through the pterygoid region to the deep parts of the head, the nose, and the palate, supplying many offsets. a. External carotid artery. g. Deep temporal artery. h. Posterior auricular branch. ! Buccal artery. c. Superficial temporal artery. {. ■ 1. Posterior dental branch. d. Internal maxillary artery. n. Facial ai'tei-y. e. Inferior dental branch. r. Inferior labial branch. /. Branchwitlithe gustatory nerve. I s. Masseteric branch, cut. The internal maxillary artery, d, is one of the terminal branches of the external carotid, and runs upwards and inwards over or under the external pterygoid muscle to the spheno-maxillary fossa, where it ends in branches for the nose, the palate, and the pharynx. It gives numerous branches, and these are classed into three sets : —one external to the pterygoid muscle, another whilst the artery lies on the muscle, and a third internal to the muscle, or in the spheno-maxillary fossa. The first two sets will b6 mainly referred to now. The first set of brandies, two in number (dental and meningeal), belong to the lower jaw and the skull. The inferior dental artery, e, enters the canal in the lower jaw with the nerve of the same name, and supplies the teeth and the lower part of the face. Before' it enters the bone, a small oftset (mylo-hyoid) descends with a fine nerve in a groove inside the ramus of the jaw. The large or middle meningeal artery arises opposite the pre-

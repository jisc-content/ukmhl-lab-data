VEINS OF THE ARM. 43 The hrachialis anticus, F, arises from the front of the humerus for the lower half of the bone ; and fi'om the intermuscular septum on each side, viz., from all the inner one, but from only the upper part of the outer one, some muscles of the forearm ex- cluding it below (Plate xii.). It is inserted into the fore part of the coronoid process of the ulna. Resting on the humerus and the elbow-joint, it is concealed by the biceps, and vessels and nerves. Sometimes a fiesliy slip from it covers the brachial artery or the median nerve at the lower part of the arm. This muscle reaches over the elbow, and is the chief agent in bending that joint. The coraco-lracMalis muscle, H, is shown better in Plate ii., to â€¢ which reference may be made. The triceps extensor cuMH consists above of three parts or heads ; and its anatomy will be given more fully in the descrip- tion of Plate vi. The middle head, M, arises fr-om the scapula ; and the inner and outer heads are attached to the humerus and the inter- muscular septa. The insertion of the muscle into the olecranon process of the ulna will be afterwards seen. In this view of the parts the middle head lies beneath the teres major, N, and latissimus dorsi, P, and touches the brachial vessels and' their companion nerves for one to two inches. And the inner head surrounds the ulnar nerve, 8, and the inferior pro- funda artery, n : this is more evident in Plate vi. The teres major, N, and latissimus dorsi, P, coming forwards to their insertion into the humerus, bound behind the hollow of the axilla (Plate i.). The pectoralis major, E, curves over the muscles of the front of the arm as it passes ft-om the thorax to its insertion into the humerus. At its attachment to the bone, it joins the deltoid muscle, S. VEINS OF THE ARM. The superficial veins of the limb diminish in number from the hand upwards. At the elbow they blend into two, which have a

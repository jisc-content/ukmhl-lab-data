DISSECTION OF THE LAEYNX. 226 Figure I.—For this Drawing the dissection was prepared by removing the greater part of the right half of the thyroid carti- lage, and then taking the areolar tissue from the subjacent muscles, vessels, and nerves. Some nerves which enter the mucous mem- brane behind the larynx from both laryngeal trunks could not be preserved. On the right side of the tongue the extrinsic muscles have been defined as they enter it. In this, as in the other Figures, the hyoid bone, the cartilages of the larynx with some ligaments, and the trachea and the thyroid body are depicted. A. Os hyoides. B. Thyroid cartilage. C. Cricoid cartilage. D. Trachea. E. The tongue. F. Palato-glossus muscle. G. Stylo-glossus. H. Pharyngeo-glossus. I. Corniciila laryngis. J. Crico-tliyroid membrane. K. Hyo-glossus muscle. L. The epiglottis. M. Genio-hyo-glossus. N. Thyro-hyoid membrane. S. Sacculus laryngis. T. Thyi-oid body. U. Pyramid of the thyroid body. W. Levator glaudulse thyreoideae. X. Stjdo-byoid ligament, ossi- fied. Z. Upper part of the oesophagus. MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. Some of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles act more immediately on the arytsenoid cartilages, approximating them to, or removing them fi-om each other, and control the width of the glottis. Others make tense or lax the vocal cords, and so govern the pitch of the voice. One pair of muscles depresses the epiglottis. 0. Depressor of the epiglottis. P. Thyro-arytajiioideus. Q. Crico arytsenoideus lateralis. R. Crico-arytasuoideus posticus. V. Arytsenoideus. Y. Crico-thyroideus, cut. Muscles governing the size of the glottis.—The interval betvreen the vocal cords can be widened or narrowed by the three following muscles.

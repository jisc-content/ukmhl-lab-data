DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXIY. * A VIEW of the transversalis muscle and fascia, with the sper- matic cord, appears in the Plate. Supposing the internal oblique laid bare as in the preceding Plate, this dissection will be made ready by cutting vertically through the lower three inches of the muscle near Poupart's liga- ment, and reflecting it inwards. The cremaster may be separated afterwards from the cord. THIRD STEATUM OF THE GEOIN. All the muscles of the abdominal wall come into sight in this Illustration, the transversalis being the deepest; and under this last muscle lies the fascia transversalis. A. External oblique muscle. B. Aponeurosis of external, fleeted. C. Internal oblique muscle. D. Internal oblique, reflected. E. Cremaster muscle. F. Transversalis muscle. re- G. Teudou of the transversalis. H. Conjoined tendon. I. Fascia transversalis. J. Infundibuliform fascia. K. Spermatic cord. L. Internal abdominal ring. N. Edge of the rectus muscle. The transversalis, F, is the third flat muscle in the wall of the belly ; and it takes its name from the direction of its fibres. Like the oblique muscles, it is fleshy externally and tendinous internally. The part of the muscle in the groin arises by fleshy fibres from the outer third of Poupart's ligament and the adjacent fibrous band, and from the iliac crest ; the fibres are directed transversely forwards to the aponeurosis, but the lowest are curved above the cord, as this lies in the abdominal wall. The aponeurosis unites inseparably with that of the internal oblique, and reaches with it the linea alba. Below, it is attached to the front of the pubes like the internal oblique, and to an inch

The profunda artery, d, arises from the femoral trunk about one inch and a half below Poupart's ligament; and it is called sometimes deep femoral from fts position to the parent trunk. It courses on the inner side of the femur parallel to, but beneath the femoral trunk, as far as the lower third of the thigh, where a fine branch continues it onwards to the back of the limb. It has the following connections with muscles :—At first it rests on the iliacus, and appears external to the femoral artery in Scarpa's triangular space ; then it. is directed down and in under the femoral vessels, lying over the pectineus and adductor brevis; finally it enters beneath the adductor longus, and ends in a small perforating branch to the back of the thigh. Its named offsets are two circumflex, and four perforating; but it furnishes also large unnamed muscular and anastomotic branches. Circumflex tranches. Two in number, they wind backwards, one inside and the other outside the femur, like the corresponding arteries in the upper limb, and communicate at the back of the thigh, The external circuniflex, e, is consumed chiefly in the extensor muscle of the knee-joint (p. 370), and its ramifications are dis- played in Plates xlvi. ajid LIJ. The internal circumflex, f, bends back between the psoas, B, on the one side, and the pectineus and adductor brevis, Gr and K, on the other, and divides opposite the sruall trochanter into two terminal pieces—an ascending to the buttock, and a transverse to the back of the thigh (Plate L.), In this course it furnishes an articular branch to the hip-joint, and muscular ofisets to the obturator externus and the adductors: the largest of these, //, passes bcneatlj the adductor brevis, supply- ing it and the adductor magnus, and accpmpaaie? the d,eep part of the obturator nerve.

DEEP MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 293 it adheres closely, will require some skill on the part of the dissector. On the right side the deep muscles are to be laid bare, but on the left the fascia covering them may remain entire. The small nerves issuing from the substance of the psoas muscle lie in a loose fat, and can be defined with ease. One of the muscles (diaphragm) separates the cavities of the thorax and abdomen, and is used in respiration; the others, placed on the side of the spine, take part in the movements of the lower limb and the last rib. The diaphragm, A, stretches across the hollow included by the ribs, and divides this space into two,â€”an upper part, cavity of the thorax, and a lower or abdominal cavity. The muscle is fleshy at the circumference where it is fixed to the ribs, and ten- dinous in the centre. The diaphragm takes origin externally, on each side, from the back of the xiphoid cartilage ; from the six lower ribs on the inner surface ; fi'om the two arched ligaments, H and G; and ft'om the side of the spinal column by the crus, E. All the fleshy fibres end internally in the central tendon, to which they are directed with varying lengths and inclinations. It is arched unequally on the two sides, being highest on the right. Its surfaces look upwards and downwards to the thoracic and abdominal cavities; and they diflFer in form, for the upper is MUSCLES IN THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY. A. Fleshy part of the diaphragm. B.

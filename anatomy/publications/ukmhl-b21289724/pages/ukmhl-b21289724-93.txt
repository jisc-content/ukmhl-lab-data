71 HOLLOW BEFOllE THE ELBOW. other into the ulna ; and when they contract they carry forwards those bones over the end of the humerus. After fracture of the olecranon process of the ulna—the part limiting the movements and giving security to the joint—the elbow is bent because these two muscles are stronger than the extensor muscles behind (the triceps being useless). In dislocation of the humerus on the front of the ulna and radius, the flexor muscles give the bent state to the limb. Being greatly stretched, especially the brachialis, by the large projecting end of the humerus, they contract powerfully; and the forearm is carried forwards as much as it can be to relax the tense state of the muscular fibres. The extensors and supinators on the outer side of the limb are dissected only in part: they will be described more fully with Plate xii. They are divisible, like the muscles in front, into a superficial and a deep layer. Only one of them will be referred to now. The sxipinator longus, L, (brachio-radialis Sa3m.), is the most anterior and the longest of the external group. It arises from the upper two thirds of the condyloid ridge of the humerus in fi'ont of the outer intermuscular septum (Plate xii.); and it is inserted into the lower end of the radius, close to the styloid process. Covered at its origin and insertion by other muscles, it forms part of the outer swell of the forearm, and limits externally the hollow in front of the elbow-joint. It rests upon the long radial extensor of the wrist, P, and covers the radial artery in the upper half of the forearm. At its insertion it is crossed by the extensor muscles of the thumb, S. Its chief office is to bend the elbow-joint. But it will become a supinator when the hand is quite prone ; and, when the hand is strongly supinated, it is said to bring the same into the prone position. HOLLOW IN FRONT OF THE ELBOW.

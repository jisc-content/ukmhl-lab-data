SCAPULAR ARCH. 15 FAT I¥ THE AXILLA. The axilla is filled with a granular fat intermixed with slight areolar tissue. Towards tlie apex of the space the adipose tissue diminishes. In thin bodies the quantity of the fat is less, as it is in all other parts, find the space contains a watery fluid in the meshes of the areolar tissue. , The presence of fat favours in this space, as elsewhere, the accumulation of pus, which burrows amongst the loose fatty material instead of making its way to the surface tlii-ough the intervening fascia. Much inconvenience and suffering may be avoided by an early incision for the escape of the confined pus. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XL —♦— The Figure represents the deep dissection of the front of the chest, and that of the asillaiy vessels and the brachial plexus of nerves with their branches. The dissection is to be made by cutting through and reflecting the pectoralis major. To render tense and distinct the sheath of the axillary vessels, place the limb at right angles to the trunk, and rotating it inwards, press it backwards, so as to raise the clavicle from the chest. Unless this position of the arm is kept, the loose costo-coracoid sheath may be removed with the fat. SUPERFICIAL PROMINENCES OF BONE. At the upper part of the region dissected is the bony loop of the scapular arch, which is formed by the clavicle, J, and the scapula, and separates the neck from the chest and the limb. It serves the purpose of articulating the upper limb, and furnishes points of attachment to muscles moving the humerus. Injury of the arch, sufficient to break it, will arrest the free movements of the shoulder joint, and interfere with the action of the muscles.

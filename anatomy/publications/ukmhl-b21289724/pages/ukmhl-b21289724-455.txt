rOSTEllIOR TIBIAL NERVE. ' 433 for au iiicli and a half it lies inside, but thence to its termination outside the artery. Its offsets are chiefly supplied to the contiguous muscles, but it gives a cutaneous nerve to the sole of the foot. The muscular iranches, 4, 5, 6, enter the tibialis posticus, flexor digitorum, and flexor pollicis: they arise at intervals along the nerve, or sometimes by a common branch from the internal popliteal trunk. A cutaneous plantar nerve, 7, begins above the os calcis, and dividing into two or more branches is continued beneath the fascia and the internal annular ligament, nearly to the sole of the foot; its offsets, accompanied by small arteries, pierce separately that ligament, and end in the teguments of the under part of the heel (Plate LVi.). The internal saphenous vein, p, begins in a cutaneous venous arch on the dorsum of the foot (Plate lviii.) ; it then ascends, crossing the tibia above the inner ankle, and takes afterwards a position behind the posterior edge of that bone as fg-r as the knee, where it has been shown passing that articulation to reach the thigh (Plate xliv.). A nerve of the same name accompanies it. Many superficial branches enter it in this course. In the leg it communicates with the deep veinsâ€”anterior and posterior tibial, and near the knee it joins an internal articular vein. In the Figure a branch, o, is represented uniting it with the posterior tibial veins, . The internal saphenous nerve, 8, accompanies the vein of the same name to the inner side of the foot, where it ends about the middle of the tarsus, as may be seen in Plate lviii. In the leg it furnishes many collateral cutaneous offsets both forwards over the tibia and front of the limb, and backwards behind but near that bone.

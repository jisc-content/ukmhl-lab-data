In this Figure the small muscular branches of the internal plantar artery to the inner two lumbricales, and to part of the flexor brevis pollicis are dis- played. Plantar nerves. Two in number like the arteries, there is not the same disparity in size between them, for though one supplies most digits the other gives most offsets to muscles. They are placed with the bloodvessels between the first two muscular strata. The distribution of the internal nerve to three digits and a half and a few muscles has been given at p. 439 ; and the arrangement of the external nerve, which is famished to one digit and a half and many muscles, will be afterwards considered. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LVII. —♦— In this Plate the last two stages of the dissection of the foot are delineated. Figure I. Part of the external plantar vessels and nerve, with their branches, and the short muscles of the great and the little toe are represented in this Figure. After making the preparation of the parts illustrated in Fig. ii. of the foregoing Plate, the dissection of the third stage will be completed by dividing the accessorius muscle and the tendons of the flexors of the digits about two inches in front of the heeJ; and by removing the areolar tissue from the muscles, vessels, and nerves, after the flexor perforans with its lumbricales has been thrown forwards to the toes. Whilst the flexor tendon is being raised, the small nerves and arteries to the outer two lumbricales muscles are to be sought with care.

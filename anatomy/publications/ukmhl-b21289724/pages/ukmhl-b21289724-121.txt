99 SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF THE FOREARM, and fingers; but notably those of the little and ring fingersj whose short or hand muscles depend solely on the ulnar nerve for their contractile power. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XL The dissection of the superficial muscles and vessels on the back of the forearm and hand is here illustrated. This view was obtained by reflecting the integuments from the elbow to the roots of the fingers; and by removing the deep fascia, with the exception of the posterior annular ligament near the wrist. The fore finger was then denuded of its cutaneous coverings, to trace the extensor tendon to the end. SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES. At the back of the forearm are located the muscles which oppose by their action the muscles in front; and as the anterior gi'oup consists of flexors and pronators, so the posterior includes their antagonistsâ€”extensors and supinators. The posterior set is divided, like the anterior, into superficial and deep layers. In the superficial layer are contained one supi- nator, and the extensors of the wrist and digits, which are indicated below by the letters of reference. A few of the deeper muscles appear near the wrist, but these will be described with Plate xii. A. Biceps flexor brachii. B. Supinator longus. C. Extensor carpi radialis longior. D.

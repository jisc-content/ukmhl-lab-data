424 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE LEG. muscle and the fibula into its terminal branches for the fore part of the leg, viz., recurrent articular, musculo-cutaneous, and ante- rior tibial. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LV. The deep muscles, vessels, and nerves of the back of the leg are exhibited in this Plate. The dissection for this view will be prepared by reflecting the muscles of the calf, and removing the fascia and fat which then come into sight. An aponeurosis covering the central muscle is to be divided-longitudinally, and to be thrown inwards and out- wards with fibres of the two lateral muscles attached to it. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE BACK OF THE LEG. % In this group there are four muscles : three are prolonged to the foot and extend the ankle as they pass by; and the fourth, crossing behind the knee, flexes this joint. A. PopHtens. B. Fibular origin 5 f^,^^ ^^^^^^ C. Tibial origin ) D. Flexor longus pollicis. E. Flexor longus digitorum. F. Tibialis posticus. G. Tendo Achillis, cut. H. Peroneal muscles covered by fascia. The popliteus muscle, A, intervenes between the contiguous ends of the femur and tibia, crossing behind the knee-joint. It arises within the capsule of the joint by a tendon which is fixed to the fore part of a groove on the outer condyle of the femur; and, out- side the capsule, by fleshy fibres attached to the posterior liga- ment. The muscle is thin and fleshy, and is inserted below the head of the tibia into an impression on the posterior surface of the bone.

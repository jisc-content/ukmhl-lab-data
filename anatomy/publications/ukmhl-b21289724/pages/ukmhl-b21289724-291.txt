NEEVES OF THE GROIN. 269 by areolar tissue so as to produce a continuous layerâ€”the cremas- teric covering of the cord : this layer is named the cremasteric fascia when it forms an investment for an inguinal hernia. By the shortening of its loops this muscle can raise the testicle towards the abdomen: its action is chiefly under the control of the will, but at times is involuntary. Nerves. Three nerves run forwards in the groin between the external and internal oblique muscles : two are offsets of the lumbar plexus, and the other is derived from the last dorsal (intercostal) nerve. 4. Branch to pyramidalis muscle. 5. Offset of a dorsal nerve. 1. Ilio-hypogastric nei-ve. 2. Ilio-inguinal nerve. 3. Cremasteric branch. The ilio-hypogastric nerve, 1, is derived from the lumbar plexus, and has been traced at its ending in the integuments (Plate sxxii. p. 267). In this Illustration of the dissection of the groin, the nerve is shown piercing the internal oblique muscle, near the iliac crest, and the aponeurosis of the external oblique, near the abdo- minal ring, in its course to the surface of the abdomen. The ilio-inguinal nerve, 2, is an offset with the preceding from the lumbar plexus. Having, at first, a similar course with its companion, it then passes through the internal oblique somewhat lower, and issues from the wall of the abdomen at the external abdominal ring, to reach the scrotum and the integuments of the top of the thigh. It furnishes an offset, 3, to the cremaster, and another, 4, to the pyramidalis muscle. Last dorsal nerve, 5, runs forward between the oblique muscles, and perforating the aponeurosis of the external muscle opposite the linea semilunaris, ends in the teguments. Cutaneous vessels. A few unnamed cutaneous arteries with veins perforate the abdominal muscles : the chief of these are situate near the middle line, and are derived from the epigastric vessels.

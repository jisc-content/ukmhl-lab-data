DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXVII. This Illustration shows the dissection of the lumbar and sacral plesuses of spinal nerves, and that of the internal iliac artery * For the preparation of the parts displayed the psoas muscle and the veins of the right side of the abdomen were taken away ; the external iliac vessels were cut through and removed ; and the peritoneum and fat, and the internal iliac vein and its branches, were cleared fi'om the pelvis. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. The muscles now brought into view were referred to in detail in the last Plate, but the quadratus lumborum can be better learnt in this Figure. Only a small part of the diaphragm, C, has been left; and the right crus has been cut through to allow the beginning of the thoracic duct, and the large azygos vein to be seen. A. Riglit crus of the diaphragm divided. B. Left crus of the muscle. C. Fleshy lateral part of the dia- phi-agm. D. External arched ligament. E. Twelfth rib,â€”right. F. Quadratus lumhorum. G. lliacus muscle. H. Psoas muscle, cut. I. llio-vertebral ligament. K. Urinary bladder. ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC AETERIES. In this Plate the aorta is represented in outline with the origin of the visceral branches ; and its lumbar offsets are traced back to their exit from the abdomen. In the cavity of the pelvis the * Usually the lumbar plexus and the internal iliac artery are dissected on opposite sides of the body, but both have been here joined in one view on the right side, so as not to increase unnecessarily the number of Plates.

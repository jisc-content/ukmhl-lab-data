MUSCLES OF THE OR HIT. 127 the sphenoid bone. No valves exist iu tlicse cross channels, so that the blood can move freely forwards and backwards througli them; and shonld the diminished size or the absence of one lateral sinns interfere with, or stop the course of the blood on that side of the skull, the circulating fluid can be conveyed across the middle line, to be transmitted from the head by the lateral sinus of the opposite side. The internal carotid artery, a, winds through the space from behind forwards, and issues through the dura mater internal to the anterior clinoid process : it furnishes here small receptacular branches to the dura mater. Ascending around the artery is the cranial part of the sympa- tJietic nerve, which communicates with the nerves entering the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. In the sinus lies the sixth cranial nerve, 6, which courses from behind forwards, close outside the carotid artery, and commu- nicates largely with the sympathetic. Another large central sinus, named torcular Herophili, is placed opposite the occipital protuberance, and receives blood ft'om the brain. Opening into it in front is the straight sinus G, (Plate xiii.) ; above is the superior longitudinal, 0 ; and below is the occipital sinus contained in the falx cerebelli. On each side issues the large lateral sinus, which extends to the foramen jugulare, joining there the internal jugular vein, and conveys from the skull the blood both of this and of the cavernous sinus. DISSECTION OF THE CEBIT. The third stage of the dissection, which is represented on the right side, will be obtained by clearing away the vessels shown in the left orbit in Plate xiii. And the preparation of the last stage, as exhibited on the left side, may be made by removing the lenti- cular ganglion and the nasal nerve, and by dividing the optic nerve and raising the ends.

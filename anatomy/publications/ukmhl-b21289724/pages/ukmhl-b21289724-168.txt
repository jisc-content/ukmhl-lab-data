146 DISSECTION OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. The nerve to the rhomboid muscle, 7, pierces the fibres of the scalenus medius, and is inclined backwards beneath the elevator of the angle of the scapula. Nerve to the serratus magnus, 8, (posterior thoracic). This nerve issues through the scalenus medius, below the preceding, and is continued beneath the cords of the plexus to the axilla. See Plate ii., 5. The nerve to the subdavius, 10, passes in front of the subclavian artery to the under surface of its muscle. The svpra-sca'pular nerve, 12, accompanies the omo-hyoid muscle to the back of the scapula, and supplies the supra and infra-spinate muscles, the shoulder-joint, and the blade bone. The two remaining nerves, which arc seen in this part of the neck, belong to the cranial set. The spinal accessory nerve, 13, (eleventh cranial) pierces the sterno-mastoideus, and ends in the trapezius, after crossing the posterior triangular space, where it joins the spinal nerves. Under the trapezius it communicates with the nerve marked, 9, before it enters the fleshy mass. The posterior auricular, 14, a branch of the facial or seventh cranial nerve, ascends in front of the mastoid process, and being joined by the great auricular nerve, splits into two :â€”one piece belongs to the integuments of the back of the ear, and the retrahent muscle of the pinna ; and the other supplies the hinder belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle, and the integument con- tiguous to it. Lymphatics. Beneath the fascia lies a collection of cervical lymphatic glands in the clavicular part of the posterior triangle. They communicate below with the lymphatics of the axilla ; and above with those about the ear and the occiput, by means of the superficial lymphatic vessels and glands accompanying the external jugular vein. Beneath the stemo-mastoideus they join also the deep glands by the side of the carotid vessels.

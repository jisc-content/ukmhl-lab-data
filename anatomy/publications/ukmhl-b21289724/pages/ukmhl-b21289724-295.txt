Vessels from two sources, the epigas- tric and circumflex iliac, are met with in this dissection. c. Cremasteric brandies of tlio epigastric. a. Epigastric artery and veins, 6. Branches of circumflex iliac. The epigastric artery, a, is derived from the external iliac, and ascends obliquely upwards and inwards across the groin to enter the sheath of the rectus muscle. The part now seen lies close inside the internal abdominal ring, and benealih the fascia trans- vei'salis. It furnishes small branches internally and externally : two of the outer set marked with, c, enter the cremaster, and receive their appellation from that muscle. Th.Q circumflex «7mc artery arises from the external iliac opposite the epigastric (Plate xxxv.), and. runs beneath the transversalis muscle round the iliac crest. Offsets, h, are given to the contigu- ous muscles. Veins. Two veins belong to each artery, but they blend into • one in each case, and end in the external iliac near Poupart's ligament. ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA. A protrusion of intestine through the wall of the belly in the groin constitutes an inguinal hernia. It may escape through the internal abdominal ring with the cord ; or it may be placed still more internally—opposite the conjoined tendon, H. If the gut descends with the cord it lies outside the epigastric artery, and the hernia is called external inguinal. But if the intestine makes a way for itself opposite the conjoined tendon the tumour forms an internal inguinal hernia in consequence of its position inside tlie epigastric vessels. The differences between these two kinds of hernia will now be adverted to. External inguinal hernia is directed downwards by the side of the spermatic cord ; and it is called also oblique inguinal hernia from its direction in the abdominal wall.

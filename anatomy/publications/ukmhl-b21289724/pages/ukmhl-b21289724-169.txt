DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XVL This Plate exhibits a surface-view of the side of, the neck, in front of a line from the mastoid process to the inner end of the clavicle. Supposing the skin thrown aside as in the Figure, the thin fleshy fibres of the platysma will appear through a slight fatty covering, and may be readily cleaned. This muscle may be then raised towards the jaw by a cut over the sterno-mastoideus, the superficial veins and nerves being traced out at the same timCi Before the removal of the deep fascia the subjacent muscles should be fixed in their .natural position by stitches, to prevent their slipping out of place when the investing sheaths are taken away. Afterwards the areolar tissue and fat are to be cleared out between the jaw and the hyoid bone, and from the whole surface of the space laid bare. SURFACE VIEW OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. The prominent sterno-mastoid muscle, B, divides into two the side of the neck; and in front of it is a slight hollow, which is most marked near the jaw, and is wider above than below. In front of the stemo-mastoideus lie the elevator and depressor muscles of the hyoid bone,â€”^the former extending downwards from the lower jaw, and the latter reaching upwards from the chest and shoulder. Below the side of the jaw is the submaxillary gland, K, with a chain of small lymphatic glands reaching backwards to the sterno-mastoid muscle ; and a lymphatic gland, with a small artery entering it, is lodged just above the body of the hyoid bone. Between the jaw and the ear the parotid gland, L, is wedged in. L 2

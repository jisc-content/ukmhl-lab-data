2 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. at the arm bone they approach one another. In the interval between them, near the humerus, the large vessels and nerves of the limb are lodged. The muscles of the arm connect the limb with the scapula, and assist in the movements of the shoulder joint: they will be more fully seen in other Plates. A. Pectoralis major. B. Peotoralis minor. C. Latissimus dorsi. D. Teres major. F. Serratus magnus. H. Siibscaptilaris. K. Coraco-brachialis. L. Biceps. M. Fascia of the arm. N. Triceps muscle. P. External head of the triceps. The pectoralis major, A, reaches from the chest to the arm over the front of the axilla. By its inner end (origin) it is attached to the sternum and the cartilages of the true ribs, except the last, as well as to a part of the clavicle; and it joins the tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen below. By its outer end (inser- tion) it is fixed into the bicipital groove of the humerus. Plate ii. P. The muscle forms the main part of the anterior boundary of the axilla; and towards its lower end near the arm-pit the mamma or breast rests on it. Should the breast be diseased so as to render necessaiy its removal, the limb should be placed during the operation in the position shown in the Illustration, and the scalpel should be carried in the direction of the fibres in detaching the mass to be extirpated. The pectoralis minor, B, is extended, like the preceding, from the chest to the limb in front of the axilla. Only a very small part is now visible : for a view of the muscle see'Plate ii. B. The latissimus dorsi, C, resembles in its position behind the axilla the large pectoral muscle in front. Arising below from the spinal column, the pelvis, and the lower ribs, it is inserted into the bicipital groove of the humerus. The upper edge of the muscle has been everted in the Drawing to bring into sight the vessels and the nerve lying inside it. Oftentimes a fleshy slip is continued fi'om the latissimus over

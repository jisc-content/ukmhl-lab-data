63 MUSCLES OF THE AKM AND SHOULDER. (Plate vii.) The figure, 2, marks an offset from it to the middle head of the triceps. The ulnar nerve, 3, lies along the inner side of the arm as far as the elbow (Plate iv.). In the lower half of its course it is placed at the back of the limb, behind the inner intermuscular septum, and is partly concealed by fibres of the inner head of the triceps. In excision of the articular ends of the bones of the elbow- joint through the triceps, the ulnar nerve is liable to be cut. To secure it from accident the nerve is dislodged from its hollow during the operation, and is moved to the front of the projecting inner condyle of the humerus. Temporary loss of the power of contraction in the muscles, and of feeling in the integuments of the inner part of the forearm and hand, follows division of the nerve ; and this lost power would not be regained till the nerve structure has been repaired. DESCEIPTION OF PLATE YII. Dissection of the musculo-spiral nerve at the back of the arm, with its accompanying arteryâ€”the profunda. Supposing the triceps denuded, as in Plate vi., the middle and outer heads are to be cut through after the manner shown in the Figure, to trace the nerve and its vessels. At the outer part of the muscle, a small branch of nerve and artery should be followed through the fleshy fibres to the anconeus muscle of the forearm. MUSCLES OF THE ARM AND SHOULDER. After the triceps has been divided in the way indicated, the attachment of the inner and outer heads to the humerus becomes evident. The shoulder muscles have been displaced but little during the dissection, but they are shown on the stretch in consequence of the limb being placed in a hanging posture.

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXV. Innek view of the groin with the apertures through which the intestine leaves the cavity of the abdomen in herniar To prepare the dissection throw down the wall of the abdomen in the left groin in the form of a triangular flap; detach the peri- toneum and the subperitoneal fat from that flap, and the colon from the iliac fossa. On the removal of the fat and areolar tissue, and some glands from the side of the large iliac artery and vein, the different smaller vessels and nerves will come into sight. By separating the peritoneum from the wall of the pelvis the urinary bladder and the obturator vessels appear; but in the dissection here delineated the obliterated hypogastric artery was removed from the bladder. INNER STEATA OF THE ABDOMINAL "WALL. Inside the muscles of the abdominal wall in the groin are spread some thin membranes, which are connected with hernia, forming coverings for it. In the inner as in the outer view the firm band of Poupart's ligament appears. A. Eectus abdominis uuder the fascia. B. Crural arch. C. Gimbernat's ligament. D. Iliac fascia. E. Sigmoid flexure of the colon. F. Internal abdominal ring. G. Crural ring. H. Pectineus muscle covered by fascia lata. I. Inner inguinal fossa. J. Urachus of the bladder. K. Vas deferens of tlie testis. L. Fascia ti'ansversalis. N. Urinary bladder. Peritoneum and suhperitoiieal fat. These two layers have been necessarily detached in the dissection : they cover all the parts now laid bare, separating them from the viscera, and they close the apertures of the internal abdominal and the crural ring. The crural arch, B, or Pou"part's ligament (p. 2G4), stretches

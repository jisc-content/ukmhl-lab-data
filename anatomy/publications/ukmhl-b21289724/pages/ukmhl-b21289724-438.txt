41« DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE LEG. Svperficial veins. Two in number, and named saphenous, they begin on the dorsum of the foot—one on the outer, and the other on the inner side. The internal saphenous, h, the larger of the two, appears only for a short distance on the inner side of the knee and calf of the leg. Upwards it is prolonged to the thigh, and downwards it is continued to the foot with the nerve of the same name. At the knee it is joined by branches from the deep veins. The external or short saphe^ious, i, begins on the outer side of the foot in the venous arch on the dorsum (Plate LViii.). Bending below the outer ankle, it ascends in the teguments along the outer border of the tendo Achillis, and the middle line of the calf of the leg to the popliteal space, where it ends by joining the popliteal vein. In the lower half of the leg it lies with the short saphenous nerve, and in the upper half with the small sciatic nerve. About the foot and heel it receives many branches both superficial and deep; higher in the leg it is joined by branches from the teguments and deeper parts, and communicates with the internal saphenous vein—one of the last set of branches being marked with/. MUSCLES OF THE BACK OF THE LEG. The superficial layer of muscles, forming the projection of the calf, is delineated in this and the following Plate. In the Illus- tration a view of the undisturbed condition of the popliteal space is also obtained. A. Biceps cruris. R. Semimembranosus. C. Semitendinosus. D. Sartorius. F.

In this Figure the intermuscular hollow is represented as it appears in form and size before the lateral boun- daries are disturbed. In Plate ll the space is shown as it is usually described.

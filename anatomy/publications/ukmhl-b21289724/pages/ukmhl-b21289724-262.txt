DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. 240 surface amongst the cells of the epithelium* In their structure the nerve fibrils resemble the sympathetic more than other nerves, for they are granular, and are provided with oval corpuscles which become visible on the addition of acetic acid. Upon this nerve the faculty of recognising odours depends. In ordinary breathing, when the air traverses chiefly the lower half of the nasal cavity, faint odours fail to give indication of their presence ; but if the air is carried upwards into the olfactory region by sniffing, the odorous particles diffused in the air will be detected, because they are brought more completely into contact with the nerves. Touching the olfactory region with a solid body, as with a probe, does not excite the sensation of smell. Disease of the brain sometimes gives origin to supposed offensive odours. Fifth nerve.â€”Through the following offsets of the first and second trunks of the fifth nerve, the pituitary membrane is supplied. The nasal nerve of the ophthalmic trunk ramifies in the fore part of the cavity from the roof to the nostril; and acts as the guardian nerve of the anterior opening by endowing the part referred to with great sensibility. Irritation of the anterior portion of the nasal cavity gives rise through this nerve to the reflex act of sneezing, with the view of dislodging the unusual stimulus by a strong current of air rapidly expelled. The spheuo-palatine branches of the upper maxillary nerve furnish offsets through Meckel's ganglion to all the remainder of the cavity: these branches pass for the most part through the spheno-palatine foramen. Common sensibility, and the nutrition of the mucous membrane, are dependent upon this trunk of the fifth nerve. * Manual of Human Microscopic Anatomy. By A. Kolliker. Lond. 1860, p. 604.

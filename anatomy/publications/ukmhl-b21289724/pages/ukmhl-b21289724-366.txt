DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLIII. In this Plate the anatomy of the crural sheath and the coui'se of a femoral hernia may be studied. To display the erural sheath and its vessels, throw down a tri- angular flap of the fascia lata. The fat coming into view after the fascia lata is raised should be removed carefully : and the crural sheath should be detached with the handle of the scalpel from Poupart's ligament before, and from a deep piece of the fascia lata beneath it. Cut then transversely through the front of the crural sheath as is shown in the Figure ; and remove a piece of the areolar sheath aronnd the artery and the vein, so as partly to denude those vessels, ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. As the femoral hernia descends into the thigh it passes beneath Poupart's ligament, and inside the loose crural sheath to the saphenous opening. The anatomy of those parts in the thigh will be described shortly before the hernia is referred to. A. Oblique part of Poupart's liga- ment. B. Horizontal part of the ligament. C. Fascia lata of the thigh. D. Reflected part of the fascia. E. Pubic part of the fascia. F. Crural sheath. G. Femoral artery. H. Femoral vein. I. Inguinal gland in the crur^ ring. K. Crural canal. Poupart's ligament separates the I'egions of the thigh and abdomen, and has been described in page 264. From its being attached to bone only at the extremities, and arching over the parts issuing from the abdomen to the thigh, it has received also the name crural arch. Between its terminal attachments the band is curved down-

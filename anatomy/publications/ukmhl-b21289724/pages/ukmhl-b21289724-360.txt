DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 338 The vaginal artery, h, courses forwards between the vagina and the rectum to the lower end of the vagina, where it terminates in small branches : it furnishes many offsets to both tubes. The ovarian artery, I, corresponds with the spermatic artery of the male, and is, like this, a branch of the abdominal aorta. Arising from the great systemic vessel near the renal artery, it enters the pelvis by the side of the internal iliac, and is then con- tinued onwards across that cavity to the ovary. This artery is flexuous, like the uterine. At the ovary it divides into branches, which enter that body. One offset, n, runs in the broad ligament to the upper part of the uterus, and communicates with the uterine artery; and other branches are continued between the layers of the broad fold of peritoneum to the Fallopian tube and the round ligament. Nerves of the pelvis. The nerves of the muscles have been omitted in this view of the female pelvis ; and the visceral nerves of the sympathetic have been taken away, as in the dissection of the male pelvis, because they would obscure the view of the viscera. 1. Nerves in the sacral plexus, cut. 2. Lateral part of the hypogastric plexus. 3, 3. Parts of the pelvic plexus, cut through. The pelvic plexus of the sympathetic nerve (p. 330) of which parts 3, 3, remain, resembles in its composition the like plexus of the male, and supplies the viscera. It is situate by the side of the vagina, bladder, and rectum ; and it furnishes common branches to the bladder and rectum, like those of the male ; and special branches to the uterus. Fallopian tube, and vagina. An ovarian plexus of nerves accompanies the ovarian artery, and supplies the ovary and the uterus : this was taken away in the dissection.

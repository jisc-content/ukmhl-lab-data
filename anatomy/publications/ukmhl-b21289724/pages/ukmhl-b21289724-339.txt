DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXIX. The arrangement of the recto-vesical fascia is set forth in thiss second view of the dissection of the pelvis. After dividing tlie levator ani near its origin, and throwing down that muscle, the recto-vesical fascia will become apparent. To demonstrate the existence of sheaths of the membrane on the prostate and the rectum, incisions may be made in a longitudinal direction into the fascia on those viscera, as in the Figure. BECTO-VESICAL FASCIA. This membrane is attached to the viscera, assisting to support them, and foiTQS a partition between the pelvis and the perinaaum. The same letters of reference for the same parts are used in this and the preceding Figure. A. Recto-vesical fascia. B. Line of attaclimeiit to tlic viscera. C. Sheath on the prostate. D. Sheath for the rectum. E. Upper part of the rectnm. F. Bag of the peritoneum. G. Vas deferens of the testis. H. Urinary bladder. I. Spermatic cord. J. Ureter from the kidney. K. Crus penis, cut. L. Prostate. N". Triangular ligament. 0. Ejaciilator urinre. P. Levator ani, thrown down. Q. Ischial spine, cut off. R. Coccygeus muscle. S. Rectum, lower part. The recto-vesical fascia, A, gives origin in part to the levator ani muscle, and partly joins the pelvic fascia. Before the hip^ bone is removed the fascia may be seen to be attached to the wall of the pelvis above the origin of the levator ani, and to be directed inwards obliquely on that muscle to the viscera, where it meets with a similar piece on the opposite side, and forms a septum be- tween the cavity of the pelvis and the perina3um. This septum is rather convex below, and is pierced by the lower part of the

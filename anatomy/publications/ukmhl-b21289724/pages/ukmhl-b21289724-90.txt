68 DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM, paired by disease, the extensor muscles of the elbow-joint, amongst others, would be incapable of contracting ; and the elbow would therefore be bent by the flexors which, being uncontrolled by their antagonists, would carry forwards the forearm bones. Ulnar nerve, 2, 2.—The upper and lower parts of this nerve come into view in the Figure. The whole course of the nerve appears in Plate iv. Circumflex nerve of the shoulder.—The trunk of the nerve is noticed in the description of Plate v. Two oflFsets, viz., one marked, 9, for the teres muscle, and another, 10, for the integu- ments, appear behind the deltoid muscle. DESCEIPTION OF PLATE YIII. The dissection of the muscles, vessels, and nerves of the front of the forearm, with their connections undisturbed by the reflec- tion of the deep fascia, is here displayed. All the superficial coverings of the limb may be removed at once by an incision along the front of the forearm, met by a cross- cut a little above the elbow, and by another rather below the wrist. Bxit a more profitable dissection may be made by examin- ing, and afterwards removing in successive layers, the skin, the subcutaneous fat with its vessels and nerves, and the deep fascia. SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF THE FOREARM. Inside the line of the brachial and radial arteries, i and/, lies a group of muscles which act as flexors and pronators ; and out- side the vessels is a mass ^of muscles consisting of extensors and supinators, antagonists of the former set. The inner group is divided into two strata, superficial and deep. Five muscles belong to the superficial layer : of these one is a

DISSECTION OF THE ARM. 44 constant course on the sides of the biceps muscle to the axilla. A somewhat different arrangement from that in Plate iii. is here noticeable. a. Median vein of the forcann. b b. Anterior ulnar veins. c. Posterior ulnar vein. d. Median cephalic vein. /. Median basilic vein. ff. Basilic vein of the arm. 7i. Cephalic vein of the arm. s. Inner companion vein of the brachial artery. The median vein, a, splits in the usual way into two branches, which are directed outwards and inwards to receive the radial and ulnar veins. In this body the anterior ulnar veins, b, b, are large, and join the median basilic, /, at separate points, after being united by a cross branch. The basilic vein, g, formed by the union of the median basilic and anterior ulnar veins near the elbow, ascends in the fat to the middle of the arm ; then piercing the deep fascia, it is directed onwards to the axilla by the side of the brachial artery, and becomes the axillary vein at the lower border of the teres major muscle. Soon after it sinks through the fascia it communicates usually with one of the companion veins, s, of the brachial artery. Geplialic vein, h.—Only the upper part of this vein is visible as it crosses between the muscles great pectoral, E, and deltoid, S, to end in the axillary vein. Springing below from the junction of the median cephalic, d, with the radial vein, it ascends in the fat to the shoulder outside the biceps muscle. An unusual superficial artery accompanied it in this dissection. Vena, comites.—The companion veins of the brachial artery, two in number, lie one on each side of that vessel, and join at intervals by cross branches ; the inner one is marked s in the Plate. Receiving small veins which accompany the branches of the artery, they join commonly into one at the lower part of the axilla; and this ends in the axillary vein near the lower border of the subscapularis muscle (Plate ii. Jc).

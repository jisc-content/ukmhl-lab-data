DISSECTION OF THE FKONT OF THE LEG, 470 5. Recurrent tibial branch. 6. Anterior tibial nerve. 7. Branch to short extensor of tlie toes and the tarsus. 8. Cutaneous part of anterior tibial. The recurrent tibial iranch, 5, passes under the extensor longus digitorum, but over the tibial vessels, to the artery of the same name, and ascends through the tibialis anticus to the knee-joint. The antwim- tiiial nerve, 6, is directed, like the preceding, beneath the long extensor of the toes, and meets with the tibial vessels above the middle of the leg. From this point it is closely applied to those vessels, crossing them once or more; and con- tinues on the outer side of the dorsal artery of the foot till this bloodvessel enters the sole. Finally it pierces the fascia, and ends in the dorsal teguments of the great toe and the next. This nerve furnishes offsets to all the muscles of the front of the limb below the knee. It supplies, namely, the two flexors of the ankle (tibialis anticus and peroneus tertius) ; the common extensors of the toes (ext. digit, longus and brevis); and the special extensor of the great toe (ext. prop, pollicis). To the tarsus it gives a large branch, 7, which resembles much in ap- pearance the nerve distributed to the back of the wrist: from this branch offsets are distributed to the extensor brevis digi- torum, which covers it, as well as to the underlying bones and articulations. The musculo-cufaneoiis nerve, 3, takes a downward course at first between the fibula and the peroneus longus, H, and nextly, between the peroneus brevis and the extensor longus digitorum, B, to become cutaneous at the lower third of the leg. Its ending on the dorsum of the foot and the toes has been before described (p. 458), Before the nerve pierces the deep fascia it emits branches as before said to the two lateral peroneal muscles.

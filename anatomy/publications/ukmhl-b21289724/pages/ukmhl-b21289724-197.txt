175 NERVES OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. between the transverse processes of the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrte. At the back of the neck it ascends under the complexus as high as the axis, where it communicates with the two arteries before described. It supplies chiefly the complexus and the semispinalis colli. The height at which the artery appears is very uncertain; and it may be represented by two branches of different arteries. In obstruction of the circulation in the common carotid the blood will be conveyed to the exterior of the head by means of the anastomosis between the profunda and the occipital artery. The companion veins' of the arteries have not been included in the Plate: they resemble the arteries, with the exception of the vertebral which begins on the back of the head and neck, and does not enter the skull. NERVES OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. The anatoniy of the posterior primary branches of the cervical nerves beneath the complexus is here shown. A part of the small occipital nerve appears behind the ear. 1. First or suboccipital nerve. 5. Fifth cervical nerve. 2. Second cervical nerve. 6. Sixth cervical nerve. 3. Third cervical nerve. 7. Seventh cervical nerve. 4. Fourth cervical nerve. 8. Small occipital nerve. The first nerve, 1, appears beneath the vertebral arteiy, and ends in branches to the complexus, and the recti and obliqui muscles: it is joined to the second nerve by a loop. Other cervical nerves. The remaining seven cervical nerves divide into two—inner and outer branches, as soon as they leave the spinal canal. The external branches are not laid bare except that of the second: they are small, and are distributed to the muscles outside the complexus, viz., splenius, cervicalis ascendens, and transversalis colli and trachelo-mastoideus. The internal branches are directed inwards—the four highest over, and the remaining three through the semispinalis colli;

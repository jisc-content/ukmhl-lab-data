SUPERFICIAL VESSELS OF THE LEG. i]r, external popliteal nerve: appearing superficial to the fascia, it joins the short saphenous as soon as this becomes cutaneous. To the outer side of the leg it furnishes a considerable cutaneous branch, 6, which reaches two thirds or more of the distance to the heel: this branch may arise separately from the external popliteal trunk. One or two other cutaneous nerves for the upper and outer part of the leg are supplied by the external popliteal nerve. SUPERFICIAL VESSELS OF THE BACK OF THE LEG. Both cutaneous arteries and nerves at the back of the leg. Arteries. a. Trunk of the popliteal. b. Muscular branch of popliteal. c. Cutaneous branch with short saphenous nerve. d. Cutaneous branch with peroneal communicatiug nerve. e. Cutaneous part of the anasto- motic artery. are found with the cutaneous Veins. g. Trunk of the popliteal. h. Internal or long saphenous. i. External or short saphenous. j. Communicating branch between saphenous veins. Jc. Communicating to saphenous from posterior tibial. vems Cutaneous arteries. Many of these perforate the deep fascia at intervals, and some pierce the gastrocnemius ; but the longest and largest accompany the superficial veins. The branch, c, with the sJiort saphenous nerve springs from the popliteal trunk near the knee-joint, and accompanies the vein beneath the fascia to reach the integuments. The branch, d, with the peroneal communicating nerve, begins in a muscular branch of the popliteal trunk, and runs with an offset of the nerve to the integuments of the outer part of the calf A fyranch with the small sciatic nerve is supplied from the mus- cular artery, i, and reaches the integuments below the upper third of the leg. The cutaneous branch, e, of the anastomotic appears at the knee ; it escapes from beneath the sartorius, and is continued onwards with the internal saphenous nerve.

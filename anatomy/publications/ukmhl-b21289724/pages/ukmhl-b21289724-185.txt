163 VEINS OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, N. In the tongue the arteries of opposite sides converge to the tip (Plate xxii.). If this artery is to be tied it may be secured between the origin and the edge of the hyo-glossus muscle, as it passes near the cornu of the hyoid bone. An incision directed downwards and backwards over the cornu of the os hyoides would allow the artery to be laid bare : the hypoglossal nerve Is a valuable guide to the position of the vessel in the bottom of the wound. The facial artery, /, comes off near the digastricus, and courses under it and the stylo-hyoideus, but over the submaxillary gland. It supplies branches to the surrounding parts, and a submental oflPset below the jaw. As it crosses the jaw it lies in ft-ont of the masseter, where it is covered by the platysma : it can be easily compressed with the finger in that situation. The occipital artery, g, begins near the digastric muscle, and is directed beneath it to the occiput : the hypoglossal nerve hooks round the vessel when this arises low down. One or more offsets enter the sterno-mastoideus. The posterior auricular, h, springs near the upper border of the digastricus, and runs to the back of the ear. A cutaneous offset passes to the occiput. Temporal and internal maxillary. The maxillary, n, courses beneath the jaw ; and it will be met with in other dissections. The temporal, I, ascends to the side of the head, and gives offsets to the ear : anteriorly it supplies a large branch to the face— transverse facial. VEINS OF THE FRONT OP THE NECK. Three in number, the veins are named jugular—internal, external, and anterior ; and they return to the chest the blood circulated through the head and neck by the carotid arteries. J).

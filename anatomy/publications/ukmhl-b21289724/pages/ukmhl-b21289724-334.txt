DISSECTION OF THE TELVIS. 312 The small splanchnic, 19, terminates near the preceding in the lateral part of the solar plexus. The smallest splanchnic, or renal nerve, 20, throws itself chiefly into the plexus for the kidney, and joins the solar plexus. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXVIII. First yie\\ of the dissection of the pelvis, to illustrate the anatomy of the muscles closing the pelvic outlet. For this side-view the left limb was removed by sawing through the hip-bone near the symphysis pubis in front, and near the txrticulation with the sacrum behind, the muscles of the abdominal wall having been previously divided by a cut from the one sawa part of the pelvis to the other. After forcibly abducting the hip- bone the pelvic fascia was detached, and the ischial spine was cut off with a bone forceps, and thrown dovra with its muscles. A large quantity of fat will need removal from the perina3al surface of the levator ani; from the pudic artery and nerve lying against that muscle; from the viscera in the pelvis; and from the branches of the internal iliac artery and the sacral plexus. MUSCLES CLOSING THE PELVIC OUTLET. Three muscles, viz., levator ani, coccygeus, and pyriformis, close on each side the elongated interval between the ilio-sacral articulation and the symphysis pubis. Other muscles of the abdo- minal wall, loins, and buttock, are shown cut through in the Figure. A. External oblique muscle. B. Internal oblique, and tlic traus- vcrsalis. C. Psoas magnus muscle. D. Iliacus muscle. E. The rectum or large intestine. F. Bag of the peritoneum. G. Vas deferens of the testis. H. Urinary bladder. I. Spermatic cord.. J. Ureter of the kidney. K. Crus penis, cut thi-ough. Ij. Anterior layer i of triangular N. Posterior layer j ligament. 0. Ejaculator urinse muscle. P. Levator ani muscle. Q. Ischial spine, cut off. R. Coccygeus muscle. S. Sphincter ani externus. T. Gluteus maximus muscle. V. Pyriformis muscle. "W. Hip-bone, cut.

The labour connected with this Work was divided between its two authors, that part being apportioned to each which he was best fitted by previous knowledge and experience to execute. To Mr. Ford were assigned the original Drawings, and the chromo-lithography ; and to him is due the merit of portraying with so much effect and exactness the natural appearance of the parts dissected. Upon me rests the responsibility of the selection of the Illustrations, the fidelity of the dissections, and the accuracy of the whole. During the progress of this undertaking, which was con- tinued through several years, other engagements necessitated my having recourse occasionally to the senior Students of the College for the help of their hands. To those Students, and to Mr. Samuel Onley in particular, I gladly offer my thanks for their assistance. And to the late Mr. J. S. Cluff, Demonstrator of Anatomy, I am greatly indebted for the valuable aid he afforded me at all times. Before closing this retrospect of the task now finished, I may advert to the difiiculties attendant on the printing in colours of such complicated Figures, and to the successful way in which they were overcome by Mr. West.

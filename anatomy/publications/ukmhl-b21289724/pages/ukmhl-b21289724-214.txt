DISSlilUTION OF THK UPPKR MAXILLARY NRRVE. being specially brought down ; and the integuments around the eye are wrinkled, and drawn towards the nose. In paralysis of the muscle the eyelids cannot be brought together, and the eyeball remains constantly uncovered. Elevators of the upper lip. Three muscles raise the upper lip, viz., a common and a special elevator, and an elevator of the angle of the mouth. The elevator of the am/le, D, arises from the canine fossa of the upper jaw bone, and blends at the corner of the mouth with other muscles. The special elevator, E, arises from the margin of the orbit over the infra-orbital foramen, and joins the sphincter of the mouth. The common elevator, F, arises from the upper jaw bone at the inner side of the orbit, and ends at the mouth like the pre- ceding : it is attached also to the wing of the nose by a separate slip. These muscles contracting together will raise the upper lip ; but the elevator of the angle can act independently of the others, and raise the corner of the mouth. Commonl}'^, elevation of the lip and of the wing of the nose follows foi'ced contraction of the sphincter of the eyelids, in consequence of'a fleshy slip being prolonged from the orbicularis to the special elevator. INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. Two of the terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery at the spheno-maxillary fossa are traced out in the dissection. a. Internal maxillary artery. /. Oplithalmic artery. b. Posterior dental branch. g. External carotid trunk. c. Infra-orbital branch. h. Superficial temporal brancli. d. Buccal branch. ■»■ Transverse facial branch. e. Internal carotid artery in the skull. The posterior dental arteiy, T), springing from the internal maxillary near the spheno-maxillary fossa, is inclined downwards

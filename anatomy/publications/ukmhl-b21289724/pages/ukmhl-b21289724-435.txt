NERVES OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. 413 up in the popliteal space, and descends under cover of the biceps muscle nearly to the condyle of the fcmur ; at this spot it meets the upper external articular artery, and accompanying this to the outer side of the knee, divides into two pieces for the joint. The peroneal communimting h'anch, 7, is very variable 'in size, and pierces the deep fascia near the upper part of the calf of the leg: to the integuments it distributes olfsets, and joins the short saphenous nerve (Plate Liii.). Obturator nerve, 1. The articular branch of this nerve begins on the fore part of the thigh (Plate XLVii.), and reaches the ham by perforating the adductor magnus near the opening for the femoral vessels. It is then directed along the popliteal vein and artery, supplying offsets to them, as far as the intercondyloid hollow of the femur; here it quits the artery on the inner side, and enters the joint by piercing the posterior ligament. Small sciatic nerve, 14. In the first two Plates of the dissection of the buttock this nerve has been more completely depicted than in this Figure. The origin and separation of the branches at the lower border of the gluteus maximus are visible, but most of the limb-branches have been cut through near their beginning. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LIII. The cutaneous vessels and nerves, and the superficial muscle of the back of the leg, are represented in this Illustration. The skin is to be reflected by means of a median longitudinal incision along the back of the leg, from four inches above the knee- joint to the sole of the foot, with a transverse cut at each end of it. In the fat which then appears the superficial nerves and vessels rnay be found in the situations pointed out in the Figure ; though the short saphenous nerve does not come through the deep fascia till half way along the leg.

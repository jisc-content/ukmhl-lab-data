SUMMARY OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES. 112 together, and form larger and more frequent anastomoses the nearer they approach the digits ; and in this way provision is made for the onward course of the blood even when the trunks may be closed. The veins are provided with valves, which prevent a backward flow of the blood in tliem; and they are also united by col- lateral branches, so that the circulating fluid, stopped in one vessel, may be carried upwards more or less perfectly by another channel. Besides the deep veins, which are more numerous than the arteries they accompany, superficial veins ramify in the subcutaneous fat: both sets join at intervals. In both limbs the nerves divide and decrease in size, like the arteries; but the branches are very constant, and regular in their distribution: they seldom join each other, unless they are sub- cutaneous. All the nerves of the upper limb, with the exception of a few in the integuments of the shoulder and inner side of the arm, come from the brachial plexus. Each of the larger nerves supplies muscles and integuments. The smaller ones end altogether in the muscles about the shoulder. And two (large and small internal cutaneous) belong solely to the teguments. Three nerves reach the fingers :—of these, one (musculo-spiral) ends on the dorsum ; and the other two (median and ulnar) rami- fying on the palmar surface of the digits, constitute specially the nerves of touch. The three large nerves last mentioned supply most of the muscles below the shoulder :—the musculo-spiral being distributed to the extensors and the supinators, and to one flexor in part (brachialis anticus); and the ulnar and median giving branches to the flexors and the pronators.

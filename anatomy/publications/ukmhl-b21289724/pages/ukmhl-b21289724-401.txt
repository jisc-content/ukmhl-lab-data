CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE BUTTOCK. 379 and the knee-joint (Plate lii.). From the deep part of the nerve branches are supplied to the external obturator muscle. The accessory obturator nerve, 9, is a small branch of the lumbar plexus, which is but rarely present. It courses fi'om the abdomen over the front of the hip-bone, lying close inside the psoas muscle ; it then bends outvrards under the pectineus, where it joins the superficial part of the obturator nerve, and supplies the hip- joint. When it is large it furnishes occasionally a branch to the pectineus. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLVIII. —♦— In this Illustration the gluteus maximus may be observed in its natural position, together with the nerves and vessels super- ficial to it. The skin having been reflected, as in the Figure, the cutaneous nerves and vessels will be found in the fat in the positions indi- cated in the Plate. After the examination of the cutaneous nerves and vessels the gluteus may be cleaned by beginning at the upper border in the right limb, and at the lower border in the left limb. CUTANEOUS NERVES ANJD VESSELS OF THE BUTTOCK. The cutaneous nerves of the buttock are derived from many sources, and come from both the anterior and posterior primary trunks of the spinal nerves. Small superficial vessels accompany the nerves. 1. Lateral cutaneous of tlie last dorsal nerve. 1'. Iliac branch of ilio-hypogastric. 2. Lumbar nerves (posterior pri- mary trunks). 3. Sacral nerves (posterior primary trunks). 4. Sacral nerves (anterior primary trunks). 5. PeriuiEal branch of tho 4lh sacral (anterior primary trunk). 6. Recurrent cutaneous of small sciatic. 7. Haimorrhoidal branch of tho pudic. 8. Inferior pudendal of the small sciatic. 9. Cutaneous to the thigh of the small sciatic. 10. Small sciatic nerve.

DISSECTION OP THE ABDOMEN. 298 Many of the fibres join internally the tendon of the psoas muscle, but the rest pass beneath Poupart's ligament, and are inserted into the femur in front of, and below the small tro- chanter. On the right muscle rests the cEecura, and on the left the sio-- moid flexure of the colon. Below the pelvis the muscle covers the hip-joint; and as it passes over the anterior edge of the hip- bone, a small bm-sa lies underneath it. If the lower limb is free the iliacus assists the psoas in flexing the hip-joint; and if the limb is fixed the muscle will bring for- wards the pelvis on the head of the femur. Lymphatic glands, | f. A chain of glands lies by the side of the large bloodvessels. From these glands small efferent vessels are continued upwards to unite with the thoracic duct near the beginning (Plate xxxlii.). BLOODVESSELS OF THE ABDOMEN. . A large arterial, and a venous trunk traverse the abdomen :â€” the former (aorta) supplies offsets in the cavity, and a large vessel to each limb ; the latter (vena cava), formed by the union of two large veins, one from each limb, gathers smaller branches from the abdominal walls and the viscera. a.

The aorta, a, the main vessel of the body, extends through the thorax and abdomen. The part in the latter cavity is called ab- dominal, and reaches ft'om the opening in the diaphragm to the left side of the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it bifui-cates into A

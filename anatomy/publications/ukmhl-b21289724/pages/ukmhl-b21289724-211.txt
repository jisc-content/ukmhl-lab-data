189 NERVES OF THE TONGUE. a. Common carotid trunk. b. External carotid artery. c. Upper thyi-oid branch. d. Lingual artery. e. Kauine branch. /. Sublingual branch. g. Facial artery, cut. h. Occipital artery. i. Branch of the sublingual artery. I. Internal jugular vein. The lingml artery, d, springing from the external carotid, runs obh'quely upwards beneath the hyo-glossus to the under surface of the tongue, where it takes the name ranine, and continues along the middle line to the tip—distributing offsets. Near the front of the tongue the arteries of opposite sides correspond with the frsenum lingua in position, and may be cut when that fold of the mucous membrane is snipped with a scissors in tongue-tied infants. A few named branches come from the artery: the most un- important is the hyoid branch, which supplies one or more of the muscles attached to the ob hyoides. Beneath the hyo-glossus a dorsal lingual branch, takes its origin. And at the fore part of that muscle arises the sublingual branch, /, which supplies the gland of the same name and the contiguous muscles, and joins the artery of the opposite side by means of the twig, i. Lingual vein.—Its anatomy is similar to that of the artery, and it ends in the internal jugular vein. NERVES OF THE TONGUE. Six large nerves end in the tongue, three in each half ; and the three of the right side are delineated as they course through the submaxillary region. 1. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 2. Hypoglossal nerve. 3. Descendens noni branch. 4. Upper laryngeal nerve. 5. Gustatory nerve. 6. Submaxillary ganglion. 7. Loop between the gustatory and hypoglossal nerves. The hypoglossal nerve, 2 (twelfth cranial, Plate xxiv.), is the motor nerve of the tongue. Coursing with the lingual artery as far as the hyo-glossus it passes over this muscle, and enters the fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus, in which it is continued to the

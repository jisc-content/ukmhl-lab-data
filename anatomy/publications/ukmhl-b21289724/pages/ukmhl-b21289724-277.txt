DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXI. This figure is designed to exhibit the triangular ligament of the uretlira, and the muscles and vessels enclosed in it. This tliird dissection of the perinasum may be made, after the preceding, by taking the cjaculator urinas from the urethra, and by detaching on the left side the erector penis and the crus penis from the bone. Next a vertical cut on the left side may be can-ied through the fore part of the triangular ligament, for the lower two thirds of the depth, to show the parts-between the layers. THE URETHRA AND THE TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT. The tube for the conveyance of the urine curves through the fore part of the perineal space from the bladder to the end of the penis, and pierces the triangular ligament. It is divided into three regional parts, as before said (p. 250). In Plate XL. the form and length of these divisions are better displayed.' The spongy or outer portion, about six inches in length, re- ceives its name from being surrounded by a vascular structure, the corpus spongiosum urethr^e. Posteriorly the spongy material swells out into the bulb, C, where the diameter of the canal is also enlarged; and in front it is dilated into the glans penis, with a corresponding dilatation inside. Usually there is a median depression in the bulb, over the position of a partition which divides the corpus spongiosum into a right and a left half. The swelling of the bulb is united to the front of the triangular liga- ment by fibrous tissue; and it, with about two inches of the urethra, is covered by the voluntaiy ejaculator urinaa muscle. The membranous part of the tube, the shortest, is directed upwards and backwards through the layers of the triangular liga- ment. Its length is three fourths of an inch. Its distance from

DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 364 A superficial branch of the anastomotic, i, accompanies the trunk of the saphenous nerve beneath the sartorius, and ends in the integuments with that nerve. The femoral vein, Jc, is the companion to the artery, and has the same extent. Closely united throughout to the artery it changes its position to that vessel about the middle of the thigh, for it is on the inner side above, but on the outer side below. Near Poupart's ligament it is placed over the interval between the psoas and pectineus, but farther in the thigh it has connec- tions with parts around like those of the artery. Its branches are similar for the most part to those of the artery, but they have been taken away in the progress of the dissection. Near the top of the thigh it receives in addition the superficial or saphenous vein ; and at the same place it is joined by the small vein, n, accompanying the deeper of the two super- ficial pudic arteries. ANTERIOE CEUEAL NERVE. This large nerve of the lumbar plexus (p. 309) divides in Scarpa's triangular space into a superficial and a deep set of branches. The superficial set consists of internal cutaneous, middle cuta- neous, and internal saphenous ; but as the middle cutaneous has been noticed sufficiently with Plate xliv. it will not be referred to again. The internal cutaneous nerve, 5, inclines beneath the sartorius to the inner side of the thigh, and divides into two parts, anterior and inner. The anterior part, 6, is delineated in Figure xliv., and its description is given in page 353. The inner part, 7, descends along the inner border of the sartorius nearly to the knee, where it becomes a cutaneous nerve of the leg (Plate xliv.). Near its beginning it is joined by an offset from the obturator, 15 ; and lower down (occasionally) by a branch, 8, from the internal saphenous. See also p. 353. The internal saphenous nerve, 13, courses beneath the sartorius, and at the insertion of that muscle becomes cutaneous below the

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLI. A SIDE yiew of the viscera of the female pelvis is pourtrayed in this Figure. The right limb was detached from the trunk as the first step in the dissection ; and the levator ani having been thrown down, the fat and fascia were removed from the vessels and the viscera. The peritoneum was taken away, in part, to demonstrate the extent of the pouches of that membrane before and behind the womb. For the purpose of supporting the hollow viscera, so as to render the cleaning of them more easy, some tow was intro- duced into the rectum and vagina, and air into the bladder. In the female pelvis are contained the bladder and the rectum as in the male ; and between them the uterus and the vagina are interposed. Rectum, C, D. This part of the large intestine has the same extent and cmwe in the two sexes ; but in this body there was a deeper indentation than usual near the lower end of the sacrum. Behind it are the sacrum and coccyx ; and in front it touches the uterus and vagina, which separate it from the bladder and CONNECTIONS OF THE PELVIC VISCEKA. A. Body of the uterus. B. Vagina. C.

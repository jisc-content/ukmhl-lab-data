181 NEKVES OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. Besides branches received from the orbit and the face, it is joined opposite the angle of the mouth by a vein—the deep facial, z, or the anterior internal maxillary, which brings blood fi-om the ptery- goid region and the upper jaw. Internal maxillary vein, iv. Only the ending of this in the external jugular remains,—the plexiform continuation of it by the side of the artery having been taken away. NERVES OE THE TTERYGOID REGION. The nerves appearing in this dissection are branches of the inferior maxillary trunk of the fifth cranial nerve, with the ex- ception of two small nerves, one lying along the upper jaw, and another on the lower jaw. 1. Auriculo-temporal uei ve. 2. Inferior dental nerve. 3. Gustatory nerve. 4. Masseteric nerve, cut. 5. Buccal nerve, t). Posterior dental nerve. 8. Buccal branches of the facial nerve. The anatomy of the inferior maxillary nerve is described with Plate xxi.; but the position of its several branches passing the external pterygoid can be here seen before the muscle is raised. This large trunk of the fifth nerve is concealed as it leaves the skull by the external pterygoid ; and its branches escape through the muscle or at its edges. Appearing at the upper border are the masseteric nerve, 4, and the deep temporal (Plate xxi., 8); and issuing at the lower border are three large trunks, viz., the auri- culo-temporal, 1, the dental, 2, and the gustatory, 3. The Ucccal nerve, 5, comes forwards between the two pieces of the pterygoideus externus. The posterior dental nerve, 6, a branch of the upper maxillary trunk, descends along the upper jaw with its artery: its origin and distribution may be refeiTed to in Plate xxiii.

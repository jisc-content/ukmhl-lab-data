217 USE OF THE SOFT PALATE. palato-glosBUS muscle moves inwards behind the morsel, barring with the tongue its return to the mouth, whilst the palato- pharyugeus forms with the uvula an inclined plane above it, the food is conveyed into the pharynx. In vomiting the aliment takes a retrograde course from the stomach through the mouth; and the moveable palate is used as a valve to shut off the upper region of the pharynx and the nose. The position of the velum during this act is similar to that occu- pied by it in deglutition, viz., it is moved somewhat horizontally backwards towards the wall of the pharynx, and the palato-pharyn- a:ei with the contracted uvula between them form behind an in- clined plane. The soft palate is not capable however of blocking up entirely the tube of the pharynx, for some of the ejected matter is forced by the side of it into the nose cavity. The influence of the soft palate on the voice seems to be small, though this flap forms part of the winding passage through which the sound is transmitted after its production by the vocal cords in the larynx. In the high notes in singing the palatine arches and the uvula are contracted, but touching them does not produce alteration of the note : this tense state has been thought to increase the resonance of the voice, VESSELS AND NERVES.

197 SUBCLAVIAN AND CAROTID ARTERIES. The longus colli muscle, K, lies on the front of the spinal colinnn, between the atlas and the second dorsal vertebra ; and it is attached to the bodies of the vertebras and to certain of the transverse processes. For the complete display of the muscle the pharynx should be detached. The muscle bends forwards the spine, and can rotate the same by means of the lateral slips connected with the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrtB. SUBCLAVIAN AND CAROTID ARTERIES. In this Illustration the internal carotid artery can be observed throughout; and by means of the Figure a more complete view of some of the branches of the subclavian and carotid trunks may be obtained. a. Subclavian trunk. &. Vertebral artery. c. Internal mammary branch. d. Thyroid axis. e. Inferior thyroid artery. f. Supra-scapular artery. g. Transverse cervical artery. h. Ascending cervical branch. i. Common carotid trunk. k. Upper thyroid artery. I. Crico-thyroid branch. m. E.xternal carotid trunk. n. Laryngeal branch. 0. Lingual artery. p. Facial artery. q. Occipital artery, cut; with a branch to steruo-mastoideus. r. Tousillitic branch. s. Inferior palatine branch. t. Ascending pharyngeal artery. V,. Internal carotid trunk. X. Internal maxillary artery, cut. y. Internal jugular vein, cut. Subclavian trunk—The arch of the subclavian artery, and the branches of its first part (p. 157) are here represented. In this body a rare condition of the inf&rior thyroid artery, e, existed; * the vessel sprang from the vertebral artery, h, instead of the thyroid axis, d, and then took its usual course to the thyroid body, N. Commmi carotid artery, z.—The extent and situation of the artery, and the nerves in connection with it (p. 158) can be well perceived in this Plate. In this body the arterial trunk splits into two at a point liigher than usual. * In Mr. Quain'.s Surgical Anatomy of the Arteries, p. 169, it is said to have been seeD ouce.

377 NERVES OF THE EOllE TART. Perforating arteries. Four in number, they pierce the aponeu- roses of the adductor muscles, close to the femur, and are named first, second, &c. After reaching the back of the thigh they supply muscular offsets to the biceps, and then turn round the femur on the outside to end in the vastus extemus. See Plate Lii. The first perforating, h, arises opposite the lower border of the pectineus muscle, and perforates the adductors brevis and The second perforating, i, leaves the trunk half way down the adductor brevis, and passes through the same adductors as the preceding branch : it gives an offset to the shaft of the femur. The third perforating, j, springs from the profunda at the lower border of the adductor brevis, and is transmitted through the adductor magnus to its destination. The continuation of the profunda or the fourth perforating, 1c, pierces the great adductor muscle near the opening for the femoral artery. Muscular hranches of the profunda enter the adductors; but the largest, three or four in number, pass through the adductor magnus to end in the hamstring muscles behind, where they maintain a chain of anastomoses at the back of the thigh (Plate LII.). The profunda vein accompanies the artery of the same name, and ends - above in the femoral vein. In this course it is super- ficial to its artery, and is situate between the trunks of the femoral and profunda arteries. Two nerves are included in this dissection, viz. the anterior crural, and the obturator; the first nerve and its branches are marked by the same numbers as in the preceding Figure. magnus. NERVES OF THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. 1. Anterior and middle cutaneous of the thigh, cut. 2. Trunk of the anterior crural. 3. Nerve of the rectus, cut. 4. Nerve to the vastus externus. 5. Upper nerve to vastus intoruus.

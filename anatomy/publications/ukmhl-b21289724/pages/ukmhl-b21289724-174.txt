162 DISSECTION OF THE FliONT OF THE NECK. Tlie anatomy of the several artei-ies will be given with the description of Plate xvii. SUPERFICIAL VEINS OF THE NECK. Two superficial jugular veins, and the facial and lingual veins, appear in this dissection. h. External jugular vein. I n. Facial vein. I. Anterior jugular vein. I The external jugular vein, h, is figured in the part of its course which is superficial to the deep fascia of the neck, and is con- cealed by the platysma muscle, A, (p. 143). The anterior jugular vein, I, begins in the teguments below the chin, and communicates with a branch of the facial vein. Lying superficially near the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoideus, it sinks through the cervical fascia near the sternum, and opens into the subclavian vein (Plate xviii.). It unites commonly by a branch with the external jugular. CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. The facial nerve and branches of the cervical plexus supply the superficial structures of the neck. 1. Cervical part of the facial nerve. I 3. Great auricular nerve. 2. Superficial cervical nerve. I The infra-maxillary branch, 1, of the facial nerve, issuing from beneath the parotid, sends forwards offsets beneath the platysma as low as the hyoid bone : it supplies that muscle and the integuments. The superficial cervical nerve, 2, is bent forwards under the platysma, and its branches pierce the muscle to supply the integu- ments between the hyoid bone and the sternum, xibove, it joins the facial nerve : and it is said to give ofisets to the lower part of the platysma. The great auricular nerve, 3, ascends by the side of the ex- ternal jugular vein to the ear, and ends as before said (p. 145).

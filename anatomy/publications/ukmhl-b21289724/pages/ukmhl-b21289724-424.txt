402 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. The small sciatic nerve, 2, is continued through the popliteal space, immediately beneath the fascia lata, to end in the integu- ments of the back of the leg (Plate liii.). The obturator nerve courses along the popliteal artery to reach the knee-joint, to which it is distributed : it is more fully seen in the following Plate. Lymphatics. Large lymphatic vessels with some glands lie along the blood-vessels. The glands are three or four in number, and through them pass the lymphatics accompanying the tibial bloodvessels and the short saphenous vein. Fat m the ham. A loose granular fat, similar to that in the ischio-rectal fossa, fills the popliteal space, and surrounds loosely the vessels and nerves, so as to permit their necessary displacement in the movements of the knee-joint. Above and below it is con- tinuous with the areolar tissue and fat of the thigh and leg. Abscesses form readily in it, and may acquire large size Avithout giving rise either to swelling on the surface, or to fluctuation. From the strength and completeness of the subcutaneous boundary the pus does not find its way readily to the surface ; and to prevent this fluid burrowing upwards and downwards under the muscles, where the popliteal space is not closed by fascia, incisions should be made through the fascia lata. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LII. In this Figure a view of the dissection of the back of the thigh is given. After the popliteal space has been examined, the hinder part of the thigh may be exposed by shtting up and reflecting the skin and the fascia between the ham and the buttock. The surface of the muscles having been cleaned, these may be separated from each other to trace the vessels and nerves.

HAMRTRTNC; AlUSCLKS. 403 MUSCLES OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. Behind the femur are situate the flexor muscles of the hip-joint, which are called commonly the hamstrings. At this stage of the dissection the insertion of the gluteus maximus can be better seen than in Plate xlviii., where the muscle is delineated. A.B.C. Insertion of the gluteus maximus. D. Quadratus femoris. E. F. Insertion of the adductor magnus. G. Long head of the biceps. H. Short head of the biceps. I. Ischial part of the adductor magnus. J, Semitendinosua. K. Semimembranosus. L. Outer head of the gastrocne- mius. N. Inner head of the gastrocne- mius. Insertion of the gluteus maximus. The filDres of this muscle are inserted partly into the fascia lata, and partly into the femur. About the upper two thirds of the whole (as far as A) end in the fascia lata. The remaining fibres are inserted by two parts; â€” one, B, the larger, is fixed into the line leading from the linea aspera to the gTeat trochanter; and the other, C, ends in the fascia lata. Biceps flexor cruris. The muscle consists of two heads, long and short. The long head, G, is spindle-shaped, and arises from the lower part of the ischial tuberosity in common with the semitendinosus. The short head, H, which is flattened, takes origin from the linea aspera, and from nearly the whole of the outer condyloid line of the femur, as well as from the external intermuscular septum. Both heads blend below in a tendon, which is divided into two pieces by the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint, and is inserted mainly into the head of the fibula, but a small part is prolonged to the head of the tibia: from the tendon a process is continued to the fascia of the leg. Uncovered by muscle except above, where the gluteus maximus conceals it, the biceps lies on the adductor magnus, and crosses the great sciatic nerve. To its inner side is the semitendinosus, J.

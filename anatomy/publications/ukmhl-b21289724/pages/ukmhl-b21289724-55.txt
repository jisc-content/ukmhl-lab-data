BLOOD-LETTING AT THE ELBOW. 33 Supposing the median basilic vein, g, to be selected for vene- section, the position of the brachial ai-tery is to be ascertained by the pulsation, and the vein is not to be opened directly over the beating artery. After this examination the operator stands on the inner side of the limb and grasps the forearm near the elbow with his hand, placing the thumb in front ; and, using his left hand for the right arm, and the opposite, he will hold the lancet in the left hand when taking blood from the left limb. With slight pressure of the thumb the vein is now to be fixed ; and if this step is omitted, the point of the lancet only punctures and pushes aside the full and freely moveable vein. The aperture into this vessel is to be made close to the thumb, both the skin and the vein-wall being divided obliquely to the same extent; and it should be large enough to prevent the blood clotting, and closing it too soon. To give the necessary size (about a quarter of an inch) the lancet is first to be pushed downwards, and is next to be made cut its way to the surface, in order that the structures may be divided from within out; for if the point of the instrument is thrust in and di'awn out, making a punctured wound, only a very small quantity of blood will flow through the opening before this is naiTowed or stopped by coagulating blood. As the walls of the vein are approximated by the compression of the thumb, too deep an insertion of the lancet may cut through the vein, causing effu- sion of blood beneath with resulting obstruction to the issuing current; and the operation may be accompanied by puncture of the subjacent brachial artery. The operator does not relinquish his hold of the arm and his control of the vein (for only a few di'ops of blood will escape till the thumb is removed) until he has had time to put his lancet away, and bring the receiving basin into the proper position. After instructing the person being bled, not to move the arm with the view of trying to direct the jet of flowing blood, he takes his thumb ofi" the vein, and allows the blood to issue in a full stream, though he still supports the limb in his own hand. Leaving the control of the limb to the patient, as when a stick is grasped by the hand, will oftentimes cause the flow of blood to cease; because in his attempts to direct the current of blood into the basin he

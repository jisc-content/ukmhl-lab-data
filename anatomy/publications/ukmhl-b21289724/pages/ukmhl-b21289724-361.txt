ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE LOWER LIMB. DESCEIPTION OF PLATE XLII. —«— This Figure sliows the dissection of the superficial vessels, nerves and glands, as well as that of the fascia lata near Poupart's ligament. The limb being abducted from its fellow, rotated out, and sup- ported with the hip and knee in a semiflexed position, the skin and the subcutaneous fat were removed, whilst the vessels, nerves and glands contained in it were dissected out. The opening for the saphenous vein should then be carefully defined. SUPERFICIAL VESSELS, NERVES AND GLANDS. The cutaneous arteries and veins ramifying in the teguments of the top of the thigh are branches of the femoral trunks. a. Superficial pudic artery. b. Superficial epigastric artery. c. Superficial circumflex iliac ar- teiy. d. Saphenous vein. «. Superficial pudic vein. /. Cutaneous arteries of the thigh. g. Cutaneous vein of the front of the thigh. h. Superficial epigastric vein. I. Superficial circumflex iliac vein. Arteries :—The cutaneous arteries in the groin, like the tegu- mentary vessels in other parts, are very irregular in their arrange- ment : their names are taken from their distribution. The superficial2nidic artery, a, pierces the deep fascia of the limb about the mid-line ; or it may come through the saphenous open- ing, as in the Figure : having entered the fat, it courses upwards z 3

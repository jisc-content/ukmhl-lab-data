DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXII. The dissection of the submaxillary region is indicated in this Figure. The steps of the dissection are the following :â€”The soft parts over the jaw are to be divided, and the bone is to be sawn through rather on the right of the symphysis ; then, the tongue having been drawn out of the mouth, the raucous membrane is to be cut along it below, to trace forwards the vessels and nerves. To make tense the muscles, fasten down the os hj'oides witli a stitch to one of the firm surrounding parts. MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE AND THE HYOID BONE. Extrinsic muscles of the tongue and elevators of the os hyoides occupy the interval between the tongue and that bone. A. Mylo-liyoideus, reflected. B. Geuio-hyoideus. C. Geiiio-glossus. D. Hyo-glossus. E. Stylo-glossus. F. Stylo-byoideus. G. Middle constrictor. H. Disastrieus. J. Inferior constrictor. K. Thyro-hyoidcus. L. Omo-liyoideus. N. Sterno-liyoidBUS. 0. Stylo-liyoid ligament. P. Great cornu of the liyoid bone. Q. Thyroid cai-tilage. Elevators of the os Mjoides. Some of the muscles of this group, viz., the mylo-hyoideus. A, the stylo-hyoideus, F, and the digas- tricus, fl, have been described (p. 157) : the remaining elevator is given below. Genio-hyoideus, B. It arises from an eminence inside the symphysis of the jaw, and is inserted below into the centre of the body of the hyoid bone. The muscle touches its fellow along the middle line, and lies between the geuio-glossus, C, and the mylo-hyoideus, A. Whcu the raouth is shut the muscle will raise the hyoid bone ;

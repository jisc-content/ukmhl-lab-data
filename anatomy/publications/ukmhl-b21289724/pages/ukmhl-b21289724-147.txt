NERVES OF THE OUIJIT. 125 orbital notch, where it issues on the forehead, and supplies the muscles and the integuments. From its inner side is given a long slender branch, supra-trochlea); to the upper eyelid and the forehead; and as it turns round the margin of the orbit, small palpebral filaments are furnished to the upper eyelid. The nasal nerve (20 left side) ends in the nose, and passes through the orbit and the cavity of the skull before it reaches its destination. Entering the orbit between the heads of the external rectus (Plate xiv.) it is continued forwards with the ophthalmic artery to the anterior of the two foramina in the inner wall (23, left side) ; here it is transmitted to the cavity of the skull. In the orbit its offsets are the following :— Firstly, there is a slender communicating branch to the len- ticular ganglion (Plate xiv. 26). As it crosses the optic nerve two or three filaments, lonff ciliary, are furnished to the eyeball. And as it leaves the orbit it gives a branch—infra-trochlear, 24, to the upper eyelid and the side of the nose. The nasal nerve is distributed finally to the mucons membrane of the front of the nasal cavity, and to the integuments of the end of the nose. Irritation of it in the nasal cavity, as in taking snuff, induces sneezing for the purpose of removing the irritating body. Sixth cranml nerve, 6. The ending of this nerve in the external rectus is dehneated in Fig. xiv. LESCEIPTION OF PLATE XIV. —♦— In the Drawing a view is obtained of the dura mater at the base of the skull, with the cavernous sinus ; and the dissection of the orbit is carried through its two deeper stages. Parts delineated in this and the preceding Plate are marked by the same letters and figures.

DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. 890 The great sciatic, 11, is the largest nerve in the body; and in it the sacral plexus terminates. In its course to the back of the thigh it is placed in the hollow between the great trochanter and tlie ischial tuberosity, lying on the external rotators below the pyriformis ; and it is concealed by the gluteus maximus till it reaches the hamstrings. As the nerve is about to leave the region of the buttock a branch for the hamstring muscles is detached from it, whose distribution will appear in Plate Lii. The pudic nerve, 2, turns over the small sacro-sciatic ligament by the side of the artery of the same name, and gains the perineal space through the small sacro-sciatic notch. Its further pro- gress is given in the Plates of the perinseum. Muscular branches of the sacral plexus supply the gluteus maximus, and all the external rotators except the obturator exfcernus. The branches to the gluteus, 6, have been cut across as they pierce the muscular fibres: these are known as inferior gluteal, like the branches of the small sciatic to the same muscle, and penetrate the upper fleshy fibres. The branch to the obturator internus, 3, with its artery, accompanies the pudic vessels through the small sacro-sciatic notch, and soon sinks into the fleshy fibres. The branch to the upper gemellus, 4, is sometimes very fine; a considerable difference in its size is manifest in the following Plate which was drawn from another body. The branch to the inferior gemellus and quadratus, 5, is a slender nerve, which runs with a small artery beneath the gemelli and obturator internus, DESCRIPTION OF PLATE L. —♦— In this Figure the third stage in the dissection of the buttock is represented.

27 NERVES m THE AXILLA. whose side it lies, and is continuous in the limb with the super- ficial vein called basilic. Plate iii. Throughout its length it maintains the same position with regard to the artery, i. e. on the thoracic side ; and it has similar connections with the parts around. Below the pectoralis minor the vein is often double, and above that muscle it has been once found divided (Morgagni). Contributing small veins, correspondmg with the branches of the artery, enter it at intervals ; it receives besides neai' the lower border of the subscapularis muscle a trunk, Ic, formed by the brachial veins, and near the clavicle, the superficial vein of the armâ€”cephalic, I. The cephalic vein, I, ascending over the shoulder between the pectoral and deltoid muscles, sinks through the fascia of the limb, and passing under the great pectoral, pierces the axillary sheath to reach its destination. Its position to the axillary artery has been specially described. NERVES IN THE AXILLA. "With the exception of one lateral cutaneous nerve of the thorax, all the nerves here represented are derived from the brachial plexus. 1. Brachial, plexus. 2. Thoracic offsets of the plexus. 5. Nerve to the serratus inag- nus. 6. Nerve to the latissimus. 8. Lateral cutaneous of the second intercostal. 9. Small internal cutaneous. 10. Nerve to the teres major. 11. Musculo-cutaneous nerve. 12. Median nerve. 13. Ulnar nerve. 14. Large internal cutaneous of the ai-m. The brachial plexus of nerves, 1, furnishes offsets to the chest, shoulder, and arm. Placed on the outer side of the first part of the artery, it surrounds the second part with its large trunks, and terminates in branches for the am, which lie around the third part of that vessel. The following are its offsets to muscles bounding the axilla. Anterior thoracic nerves are two or three in number. Two 2 3 come from the outer part, and one, 4, from the inner part of the'

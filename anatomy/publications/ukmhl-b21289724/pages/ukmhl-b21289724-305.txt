VARIETY OP INTERNAL HERNIA. 283 its traversing so much of the inguinal canal, and having a pear- shaped form like that rupture. Taxis and the truss.â€”From an inability to distinguish this tmnour from an external hernia, which it would resemble, the same precautions for insuring the return of the intestine by the taxis are to be taken, as were described for that rupture (p. 275). And the pad of the truss, which is to keep the gut in its cavity, should be placed near the situation of the internal abdominal ring, or where an aperture can be recognised by the tip of the fore finger. Seat of stricture. The remarks before made on the cause and situation of the stricture of an extei'nal hernia will serve for this rarer kind of internal hernia (p. 276). Division of the stricture. With a suspicion of the existence of the kind of rupture now under consideration care is needful in cutting down to fi'ee it from stricture ; for the epigastric vessels lie on the outer side, whilst in the external hernia, from which it cannot be distinguished, they are placed on the inner side of the neck of the rupture. In cutting down on the upper part of the hernia to divide the external stricture the scalpel should be kept well on the front and midpart of the tumour, so as to avoid the vessels lying on its side, after the manner recommended in the operation on the large doubtful direct hernia (p. 282); and in dividing the internal stricture of the neck, after opening the sac, the cut should be made directly upwards in ft-ont of, and opposite the middle of the hernia. Should these directions be observed there will be little risk of injuring the bloodvessels, even though the diagnosis between the two kinds of hernia cannot be esta- blished.

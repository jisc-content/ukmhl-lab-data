DIXON HARDY AND SONS, 22, UPPER sackville-streut.TO THE STUDENTS OF THE SCHOOL OE MEDICINE, PARK-STREET, THIS DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF THE MUSEUM DESIGNED FOR THIER INSTRUCTION IS DEDICATED BY THEIR SINCERE FRIEND AND WELL-WISHER, JOHN HOUSTON. Dublin, 31, York-street, Oct. 1843.INTRODUCTION. The School of Medicine, Park-street, was founded in the year 1824. Lectureships were established in all the branches necessary for a course of Medical Education ; and a building erected, in character with such objects, containing a Museum, two Theatres, a spacious and well-ventilated Dissecting-room, a Chemical Laboratory, and every other suitable accommodation. The success of the Institution, as an experimental under- taking, being to depend, altogether, on the attractions offered in the way of instruction, the most experienced, only, were of course those who became associated in conducting it. And the simple mention of the names of such as have, from time to time, taught in its theatres, will sufficiently account for its success. The School has had as teachers— On Anatomy—Dr. Jacob, Dr. Hart, Dr. Carlile, Dr. Al- cock, Dr. George Greene, Dr. Denham, Dr. Hill, Mr. Young, Mr. Stokes, Mr. Wilkin and Mr. M'Donnell. On Surgery—Mr. Wilmot, Mr. Cusack, Mr. Porter, Mr. Houston and Mr. Fleming. On Medicine—Sir Henry Marsh, Dr. Graves, Dr. Stokes and Dr. Duncan. On Chemistry—Dr. Apjohn, Mr. Williams, Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh, Mr, W. Colies and Dr. Aldridge. On Materia Medica—Dr. Osborne, Dr. Evanson, Dr. M‘Dowall, Dr. Banks and Dr. Eades. bINTRODUCTION. VI On Midwifery—Dr. S. Cusack, Dr. Maunsell, Dr. Beatty and Dr. Isdell. On Medical Jurisprudence—Dr. Adrien, Dr. Geoghegan, Mr. Read, Mr. Gabriel Stokes and Dr. Forde. On Medical Botany—Pr. Corbet. On Diseases of the Eye and. Ear—Mr. Wilde. The Museum was formed out of the practice of these gen- tlemen, to bear out their views in medicine, and to illustrate the lectures delivered by them in this School. The Anatomical preparations have been made by Dr. Jacob, Dr. Hart, Dr. Carlile, Dr. Hill and Mr. Wilkin. The preparations in Pathology are gleanings from Steevens’, the Meath, Sir Patrick Dunn’s, and the Fever Hospitals, with which the lecturers have been all, in some manner, connected. To the liberality of Leonard Trant, Esq., Surgeon to the Cork- street Fever Hospital, and to that of many other gentlemen, who have politely contributed specimens from their private practice, the Museum is indebted for many valuable additions. This Museum, too, it may be observed, is the depository of several series of preparations illustrative of different important improvements and works in Medical Science. Here, for ex- ample, are the osteo-sarcomatous diseases of the lower jaw, re- moved by Mr. Cusack, and with which, as being published, in part, in the Dublin Hospital Reports, the profession are well acquainted. In this collection may be seen the specimens of disease, illustrative of Mr. Porter’s excellent work on the Larynx; of his article on Necrosis in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology; and of his deservedly esteemed Lectures on Aneurism. Here are Dr. Stokes’ preparations— those which he used at his lectures in this School, and which illustrate his great and instructive work on diseases of the chest. On the same and other subjects, too, are the original preparations selected and used by Sir Henry Marsh, Bart., and Dr. Graves, for similar and equally important, purposes.Vll INTRODUCTION. In this collection are deposited the rare and valuable prepa- rations of hernia, and of diseases of the urinary and genital organs, selected from the practice of Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Cusack, and employed by these gentlemen for the illustration of their lectures and writings. A$ presentations from Sir Philip Crampton, Bart., here, also, are preserved many valuable specimens, particularly some in illustration of the effects of liga- tures on great arteries, and of experiments on the excision of diseased joints. In this Museum will be found several of the ori- ginal specimens of infantile diseases, deposited here by Dr. Evan- son and Dr. Maunsell, when engaged in writing their well-known treatise on the diseases of children. And here, too, in the de- partment of Midwifery, are to be seen many beautiful and unicjue preparations from Dr. Beatty, illustrative of able and learned memoirs added by him, from time to time, to the Medical Lite- rature of this City. By Doctor John Hill, the present talented and zealous Cura- tor, much of the information contained in this Catalogue has been furnished, especially in reference to the Pathological De- partment. The plan of arrangement is taken from the Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. (See page ix. following.) It applies equally to the Anatomical and Pathological series—the preparations, themselves, being marked, in the former, with white letters, those in the latter, with red, for distinction sake. An abstract of Cuvier’s classification of animals, as being that followed in the arrangement of the preparations in the Anatomical Department, is also introduced, here, at p. x., from the same work. The notice of each object must neces- sarily, in such a catalogue as this, be very brief. But, never- theless, as references are frequently given to published accounts of many of them, and as others will be more fully explained when exhibited at lecture, it will be found by the diligent student to serve all the purposes he can require of it for instruc-INTRODUCTION. Till tion. For the student it was written ; to him it is addressed, and by him, it will be found, if used as a hand-book in the Museum, to afford a rich source of pleasurable occupation, and an extensive mine of sound practical knowledge on the most essential branches of (his preliminary education, namely— Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology. The short history, here introduced, of the rise and progress of this Museum, and of the importance attached to it by its founders, is intended to convey to the youthful beginner a just estimate of the information which it is capable of affording him, and to invite him to apply himself assiduously to the acquisition of that information. The Museum will be always open to him ; and, failing to comprehend the preparations by the use of his book, he will always find some one, at hand, competent and willing to assist him.IX INTRODUCTION.

X ABSTRACT OP CUVIER’S CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS, REFERRED TO AT PAGE yn. J/our ffltfat Dtbtssions. 1. Vertebrata. 3. Articulata. 2. Mollusca, 4. Radiata. VERTEBRATA. Characters.—Internal skeleton—brain and spinal marrow in separate cavities—red blood and muscular heart—mouth with two horizontal jaws —five organs of sense—never more than four limbs—separate sexes. MOLLUSCA. Ch.—No skeleton—muscles all attached to external skin—nervous system situated in the visceral cavity, and composed of separate masses joined by nervous filaments—taste, sight, or, as in one instance, hearing, the only senses,—organs of circulation, respiration, and digestion very perfect. ARTICULATA. Ch.—No skeleton—two long nervous chords with ganglia at inter- vals—have usually taste and sight—divided into jointed rings, soft or hard, to inside of which muscles attached—sometimes lateral limbs, sometimes none—jaws, when present, always lateral. RADIATA. Ch.—Organs of movement and sense disposed circularly around a centre, not symmetrically as in the preceding—no visible nerves—no organs of sense or circulation—respiration performed by outward inte- gument—intestines often a simple bag—sometimes the animal is but a homogeneous pulp, without aperture or cavity.

One of the wheels of a heavy waggon passed over the chest of a man aged 30. Great pain with difficulty of respiration succeeded, and continued for three hours, when he was taken to Steevens’ Hospital: he died suddenly, on admission. The fifth rib was found fractured near its sternal extremity. Its vertebral fragment, which terminated in a sharp point, was sticking through the pericardium, oppo- site the wound in the auricle here displayed, but not into the heart itself, and the sac of the pericardium was full of fluid blood: five other ribs on the right side were separated from their cartilages. It is rational to suppose that, in this case, life was prolonged during the time which elapsed between the re- ceipt of the injury and the death of the individual, by the point of the broken rib remaining in the wound it had made in the auricle ; and that the sudden manner in which death occurred, subsequently, was the consequence of the withdrawal of the end of the fragment, permitting, then for the first time, the blood to escape and pass into the pericardium.—Mr. Cusack.

E. a. 156. A unique specimen of cellular aneurism of the os humeri in a youth, about 20 setatis. The tumour is a growth of about twelve months. In an effort of throwing a stone, he felt something give way accompanied with a sensation of pain, at the moment, in the arm. Tumefaction commenced, at first slowly, then rapidly, until it reached the size exhibited in the preparation, viz., nearly two feet in circumference. There was a considerable pain and weight, throughout; an indistinct thrill and pulsation; and a feeling like to that of parchment crackling under the finger, when pressed on. Amputation at the shoulder- joint was performed, without the occurrence of any unwonted hemorrhage, and perfect recovery followed. In the section the bone appears as a vast number of cells of various sizes, filled with blood in a grumous state, enveloped by a thin, fragile, elastic crust; the disease extending from end to end, but leav- ing the cartilaginous strata constituting the joints, free and un- altered.

22 ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. in a line before each other, and the entire bulk is very incon- siderable, compared with the size of the animal. The origins of the optic nerves are well seen in the preparation. 4 D. a. 39. The brain of a rattle-snake (crotalis horridus). D. a. 45. The brain of a shark. It consists of the same parts as the brain of the reptile. The medulla oblongata is hollowed by the depression of the fourth ventricle which is continued into it from the cerebellum. The several peculiarities of this brain and the origins of all the nerves are well exhibited. D. a. 46. The brain, nerves, and spinal marrow of a frog- fish (lophius piscatorius), in situ. The brain is remarkably small, while the cavity of the cranium is very capacious. D. a. 47. The brain, nerves, and spinal marrow of the ray (raja batis), in situ. D. a. 48. The brain, nerves, and electric apparatus of the torpedo (raja torpedo), injected. The brain is extremely small, whilst the nerves for the electric machine are of enormous size, each of them being fully equal to the great sciatic in the human body. The electric organ of the left side is preserved entire, and the form, size, and the number of the laminated cylinders of which the organ is composed, may be well understood from this preparation. D. a. 55. The brain and nervous system of the cray-fish (cancer astacus, L.). D. a. 56. The nervous system of the scolopendra morsitans. A double nervous chord runs the whole length of the animal, with a ganglionic enlargement exists opposite each segment of its body, from which lateral branches pass off to the limbs. D. a. 57. A. beautiful dissection of the larva of the sphynx ligustri. The nervous system, the digestive and respiratory organs are all clearly demonstrated.

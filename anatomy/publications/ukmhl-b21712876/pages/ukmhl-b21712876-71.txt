In this beautiful and instructive preparation, three stages of the perfo- rating ulcer are shown. The ulcer appearing in the centre is superficial, not having penetrated through the thickness of the mucous membrane: that to the left side has destroyed the mucous tunic, and laid bare the fibres of the muscular coat; and the ulcer on the right hand side has penetrated through all the coats of the intestine, causing a perforation through which the contents of the intestine had escaped and produced fatal peritonitis. A. c. 68. Perforating ulcer of the small intestine, through which the contents escaped and produced fatal peritonitis. A. c. 69. Perforating ulcer of the small intestine; lymph on the peritoneum: injected. A. c. 70. A piece of small intestine with numerous patches of ulceration, one of which has made a complete perforation. A. c. 75. Rupture of the small intestine, produced by a con- tusion of the parietes of the abdomen. The mucous membrane may be seen, everted at the margin of the opening, and pro- truding beyond the other coats. A. c. 76.

Another specimen like the foregoing, and followed nearly by similar results ; the injury, the result of a kick of an ass.—Mr. M. Collis. A. c. 80.

Glandulae solitariae of the large intestine, enlarged and ulcerated. i t

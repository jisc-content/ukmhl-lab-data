C. a. 25. The lung of an ostrich (struthio camelus).

C. a. 26. The tongue, os hyoides, pharynx, larynx, trachea and lungs of the wagel gull. C. a. 27. A preparation showing the inferior larynx, the origins from it of the bronchial tubes, and the lungs of the turkey, injected (meleagris gallopavd). C. a. 28. The lung of the wild swan (anas cygnus), success- fully injected, showing the nature of its cellular texture, and the mode of subdivision of the bronchial tubes. C. a. 29. The trachea, inferior larynx and lungs of the shel- drake (anas tadorna): there are two bony cells connected, one with each side of the inferior larynx, and two muscles for attaching them to the sternum. C. a. 30.

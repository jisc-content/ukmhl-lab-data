ORGANS OP ASSIMILATION. 63 A. c. 187. A dissection of an inguinal hernia, showing the coverings and contents. A. c. 188. A hernial sac containing omentum. A. c. 189. Artificial anus at the inguinal ring, having a por- tion of the omentum protruding: the two portions of the intes- tine entering the hernial sac are laid open ; the lower one is much contracted. A. c. 190. Artificial anus at the crural ring, with a protrusion of sloughing omentum. The adhesions connecting the pro- truded parts gave way, and fatal extravasation of the contents of the intestine followed. A. c. 192. Portion of omentum, protruding through an open- ing made with a trochar in tapping for ascites. It adheres to the opening, and is in a sloughy state at its extremity. A. c. 193. Umbilical hernia. The sac, containing intestine without omentum, had not been strangulated. The patient died of fever—Dr. Graves. A. c. 194. Diaphragmatic hernia into the left side of the thorax, in a female, about 40 aetatis. The stomach and a portion of the transverse colon lie in the chest, behind the pericardium. There is a hernial sac, to the neck of which the colon, but not the stomach, adheres. There was no history of the individual, but the intestines were found to have exhibited symptoms of dysentery. A. c. 195. Internal strangulation of a portion of the colon, by a band formed by the union of two appendices epiploic®. A. c. 196. Extensive intussusception of the ileum into the coecum. The displaced portion is constricted and sloughy at its extremity. The patient, a young man, died in Steevens’ Hospital, labouring under pain, diarrhaea, absence of solid stools, and the presence of a large, oblong tumour in the abdomen ex- tending across the umbilical region.—Mr. Cusack. A. c. 197. Small intussusception of the ileum into the coecum. In the post mortem, pus was found in the part.

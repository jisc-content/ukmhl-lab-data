UMNARY AND GENITAL ORGANS. 47 F. c. 119. An ovarium injected, showing various cells. F. c. 120. A beautiful and perfect specimen of a corpus luteum in an ovary, injected. The laminated condition of the interior of the Fallopian tube is visible even to the naked eye. F. c. 121. An injected ovarium, showing the cicatrix of a cor- pus luteum. F. c. 122. Another, like the foregoing, uninjected. F. c. 123. A preparation of the ovary of a young virgin, who died of morbus coxae, showing ovarian cells and yellow bodies resembling corpora lutea, in its interior. F. c. 124. Ovary of an aged female, shrivelled, wrinkled, and of a gristly texture, internally. F. c. 125.

Another of the same—a battle-door placenta,— the arteries red, the vein yellow : dried. F. c. 140. Human foetus, an abortion in the fourth week.

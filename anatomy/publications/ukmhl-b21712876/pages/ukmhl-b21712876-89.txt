75 ORGANS OF CIRCULATION. B. e. 102. Aneurism of the abdominal aorta, adherent to the lumbar vertebrae : dry preparation. B. c. 103. Fusiform dilatation of the abdominal aorta, from a man aged forty-five, who had two popliteal aneurisms; and all whose arteries were in a similar state of disease and dilata- tion.—Late Mr. T. Heivson. B. c 104. Considerable dilatation of the common iliac artery, with ossific deposits in its coats Same case as 103. B. c. 105. Another portion of the iliac artery of the same. B. c. 106. Part of the femoral artery of the same. B. c. 107. An aneurism of the external iliac artery, of very large size, for which the common iliac artery was tied by Sir P. Crampton, Bart.—See Medico-Chir. Trans. B. c. 108. A popliteal aneurism, which existed in the above case (107). It was situated on the same side with the iliac aneurism. The pulsation in this small tumour had perfectly ceased, notwithstanding the early separation of the ligature, showing that the short time during which the impulse of the heart had been removed was sufficient for the cure of the smaller aneurism, but not for that of the greater, which still continued to hold a large quantity of fluid blood—Sir Philip Crampton. B. c. 109. An old popliteal aneurism. The communication between the vessel and the sac is very large ; its edges very smooth, and with the appearance of the lining membrane being prolonged into it. B. c. 110. The sac of a large popliteal aneurism. B. c. 111. A popliteal aneurism from a patient who died in the Meath Hospital of peritonitis. The existence of this aneur- ism had only been noticed nine days before the patient’s death; and it bears evident marks of having been very recent. The aperture between the artery and sac is small and well defined ; its edge sharp and thin. The interior of the sac is seen, containing fibrin and lymph ; its walls thick and strong. The artery is, elsewhere, slightly diseased.—Mr. Porter.

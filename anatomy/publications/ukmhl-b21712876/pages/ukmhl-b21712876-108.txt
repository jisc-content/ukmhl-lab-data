An incipient necrosis of the tibia of a child, the re- sult of acute periostitis: the periosteum is thickened and de- tached, to a great extent, from the shaft of the bone, which ap- pears white and bloodless. E. a. 2. Necrosis of the shaft of the humerus, in a more ad- vanced stage. The periosteum of the shaft, much thickened, is shown to be continuous with that of the epiphyses, whilst the separation between the dead and living bone has already com- menced. E. a. 3. A chronic abscess in the centre of the head of the tibia, opening into the knee-joint, and which produced such vio- lent symptoms as to require amputation. E. a. 4. Necrosis of the femur after amputation. The opera- tion had been performed for spreading gangrene in the thigh, consequent upon a compound fracture of the leg ; this beau- tiful preparation illustrates many points in the pathology of necrosis. E. a. 5. The sequestrum, about eight inches in length, re- moved from the interior of the new shell of bone in the fore-

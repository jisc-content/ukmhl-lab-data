19 ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. free by the other, and seen as soon as the shell is opened, con- stitute the respiratory apparatus. C. a. 76. A cluster of barnacles (lepas anatifera, L.), show- ing their respiratory tentacula, as well as several other pecu- liarities of their organization. C. a. 79. The respiratory apparatus of the sea-mouse (aphro- dita aculeata, L.). The stigmata along the sides are marked by tufts of hair. The coeca to which the stigmata lead lie loose in a cavity, under the skin of the back, to which the water finds admission through an opening near the tail of the animal. C. a. 80. A lug-bait (lumbricus marinus, L.), showing the hairy tufts which surround the openings in the external integu- ment leading to the respiratory coeca. C. a. 85. A preparation showing the branchiae of a crab (cancer iiwenas, L.). These organs lie under the dorsal shell, and consist of seven pyramidal bodies on each side, with trans- verse ldminae, for the exposure of the blood in the branchial vessels to the action of the water. C. a. 88. A preparation of the holothuria, showing the com- plicated internal respiratory apparatus for which this creature is remarkable. C. a. 89. A sea anemone (actinea rufa), with its respiratory tentacula, in their retracted state. C. a. 92. Organs of respiration in a star-fish (asteria rubens, L.). They consist of a number of small cylindrical tubes, ar- ranged along the centre of the lower surface of the arms.

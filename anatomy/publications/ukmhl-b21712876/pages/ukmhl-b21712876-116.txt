E. a. 141. A section of a great osteo-sarcoma of the lower part of the thigh-bone in a female, about 20 aetatis, removed by Mr. Colies.

Sacculated osteo-sarcoma of the upper part of the femur. The diseased mass is encrusted superiorly with the or- dinary cartilage of the joint, in an unimpaired state. E. a. 143. The other half of the same disease, as exhibited by a vertical section. E. a. 144. Cartilaginous and bony exostosis, removed from the femur by operation.—Mr. Cusack. E. a. 145. Osteo-sarcoma of the head of the tibia. Doubts were at first entertained as to the nature of this disease. It had a distinct aneurismal thrill.—Idem. E. a. 146. Another of the same kind, which had gone on to the occurrence of fracture of the bone Idem. E. a. 147. Cancer of the tibia, springing from the medullary cavity, and shooting out a fungus through the skin : injected. E. a. 148. Cancer of the tibia, springing from the periosteum, which is diseased all round, and detached from the bone: injected. E. a. 155. Enormous osteo-sarcoma of the os humeri, re- moved by amputation at the shoulder-joint, by Mr. Cusack. The tumour consists of a fibro-cartilaginous substance, inter- spersed with laminae of bone, enveloped in an osseous crust, but without any brain-like intermixture. The shoulder-joint was

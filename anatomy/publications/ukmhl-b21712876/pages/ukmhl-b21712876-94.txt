80 PATHOLOGICAL CATALOGUE. C. a. 28. Larynx and trachea of a child, who died of acute bronchitis.—Dr. Graves. C. a. 29. Trachea of an adult at the bifurcation, the seat of long-continued distressing bronchitis: the mucous membrane thickened and ulcerated.—See A. b. 129. C. a. 30. Larynx and oesophagus of a child, who had swal- lowed boiling water. The cuticle of the oesophagus is detached, and the epiglottis and cordee vocales so tumid with submucous effusion, as to block up the opening into the larynx. C. a. 31. Another of the same kind, but with less oedema of the glottis. C. a. 40. Bronchial glands at the root of the trachea, enlarged and hardened by deposits of bone. C. a. 41.

Organized adhesions between the costal and pul- monary pleurae. Two varieties are shown—one, superiorly, a cord-like band ; the other, inferiorly, with a broader and closer attachment. The preparation has been injected, and vessels are exhibited, traversing the lower adhesion—Idem. C. b. 62. Extensive empyema of the left pleura, the result of acute pleuritis. The left pleura, in this case, contained a large collection of sero-purulent fluid, by which the heart was so dis- placed as to cause it to pulsate on the right side of the sternum. The left lung is reduced in volume by the compression, and ad- heres to the mediastinal pleura. The whole pleural cavity is thickly coated with lymph. The pericardium is also similarly coated, exhibiting a well-marked example of pericarditis. This latter affection had occurred a short time before death, and was

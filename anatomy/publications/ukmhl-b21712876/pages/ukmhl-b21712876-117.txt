103 ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. free, and, although the patient, a female, recovered well from the effects of the operation, she died subsequently of a return of the disease in the scapula.—Mr. Cusack. E. a. 156. A unique specimen of cellular aneurism of the os humeri in a youth, about 20 setatis. The tumour is a growth of about twelve months. In an effort of throwing a stone, he felt something give way accompanied with a sensation of pain, at the moment, in the arm. Tumefaction commenced, at first slowly, then rapidly, until it reached the size exhibited in the preparation, viz., nearly two feet in circumference. There was a considerable pain and weight, throughout; an indistinct thrill and pulsation; and a feeling like to that of parchment crackling under the finger, when pressed on. Amputation at the shoulder- joint was performed, without the occurrence of any unwonted hemorrhage, and perfect recovery followed. In the section the bone appears as a vast number of cells of various sizes, filled with blood in a grumous state, enveloped by a thin, fragile, elastic crust; the disease extending from end to end, but leav- ing the cartilaginous strata constituting the joints, free and un- altered. The present characters of the preparation are exactly such as they appeared when first examined.—Mr. Cusack. E. a. 157. Malignant disease of the os humeri, of large size, resembling fungus hmmatodes ; injected.—Idem. E. a. 158. A large-sized, solid, cartilaginous exostosis of the os humeri. E. a. 159. A small, malignant osteo-sarcoma of the first phalanx of the thumb, removed by amputation. The disease returned.—See E. a. 160, 161.—Mr. Cusack. E. a. 160. Great fungus, which arose in the cicatrix of the foregoing case. E. a. 161. A cast, in plaster of Paris, of the same. E. a. 162. Benign osteo-sarcoma of a finger, as large and as round as a turkey-egg, and of a cartilaginous and osseous tex- ture. Amputation, without return of disease.—Idem.

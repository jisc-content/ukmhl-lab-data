URINARY AND GENITAL ORGANS. 123 F. b. 179. Encysted hydrocele of the spermatic cord, injected. F. b; 180. Another specimen of the same disease. F. b. 181. Serous cysts beneath the tunica albuginea; they contained a thin, transparent fluid. F. b. 182. Serous cysts in the cellular tissue of the spermatic cord, with partial adhesion of the opposed surfaces of the tunica vaginalis. F. b. 183. Tunica vaginalis, the cavity of which has been obliterated by inflammation, injected. F. b. 184. Serous cysts beneath the tunica albuginea, injected. F. b. 190-91-92-93-94-95-96. These seven preparations of diseased testes were removed from the bodies of persons who died labouring under the remote effects of venereal. The prin- cipal features to be observed in these specimens are partial or total obliteration of the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, enlarge- ment of the testis, and in all, one or more deposits of tubercular matter, circumscribed, and contained in distinct cysts. F. b. 197-98. Diseased testicles, injected, removed from the body of a man who died dropsical, and who had been admitted into hospital complaining of general pains in the bones, &c.; the testes were so much enlarged as to prevent his following his usual business ; he had taken much mercury. On examination after death, the tunicae vaginales contained a considerable quan- tity of fluid, with partial adhesions. In these preparations, tu- bercular matter is seen deposited in large masses, but still per- fectly circumscribed. F. b. 199. The testicle of a man who died of venereal cachexia; the tunica vaginalis presents partial adhesions; all traces of the glandular tissue are obliterated, and the tunica albuginea is distended with tubercular matter; injected. F. b. 200. The other testicle of the same individual; although differing much in appearance, it has evidently undergone changes from disease. F. b. 201. Venereal disease of the testicle ; injected. *

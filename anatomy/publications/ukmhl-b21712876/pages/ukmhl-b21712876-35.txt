ORGANS OP SENSE. 21 a good specimen of the form of the brain among the sarco- phaga. The hemispheres are flattened, and form anteriorly the processus mammillares from which the olfactory nerves take their origin. The posterior lobes are wanting, which causes the cerebellum to appear uncovered. D. a. 23. The brain of an otter (lutra vulgaris). This ap- pears a more fully developed brain than that of the cat. D. a. 24. The brain of a kanguroo (didelphis gigantea). The hemispheres on small and nearly devoid of convolutions ; the cerebellum lies completely behind them. D. a. 25. The brain of a rabbit\lepus cuniculus),â€”a speci- men of the organ in the rodentia. The arrangement of the hemispheres, cerebellum, and pons, nearly on the same horizon- tal level, gives the whole organ a resemblance to the brain of a reptile. D. a. 26. The brain of a sheep (ovis aries). This brain pre- sents little better development than that of the rabbit, except that the convolutions are better marked. D. a. 27. The brain of a porpoise (delphinusphoccena). This is a remarkably well developed brain. D. a. 30. The brain of an eagle (falco halicctus). The hemis- pheres are of great transverse breadth, but without convolu- tions, and not divided into lobes at the base. The optic tuber- cles are very large, rising as high as the hemispheres. The cerebellum is deeply laminated transversely; the medulla oblongata is well developed, and marked by pyramidal emi- nences. D. a. 31. The brain of a raven (corvus corax), in characters like the foregoing. D. a. 32. The brain of a pigeon (colomba livia), beautifully exhibited. D. a. 33. The brain o wild swan (atias cygnus, L.). D. a. 38. The brain of a boa-constrictor. The cerebrum, optic tubercles, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, are arranged

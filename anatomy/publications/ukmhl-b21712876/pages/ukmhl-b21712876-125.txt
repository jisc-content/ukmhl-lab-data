ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. Ill and cartilages. The cavity of a small abscess appears on the for- mer, between the cartilage and bone, directly behind the patella. E. b. 304. Chronic disease of the knee of a child, in which little of the original textures remains. Fistulae appear at the sides of the joint. E. b. 305. Knee joint, of an adult, in a very advanced stage of white swelling. E. b. 306. Knee joint, the subject of chronic synovitis; the seat of the cartilages and synovial membrane is occupied with a soft shredy materiel. E. b. 307. Knee joint, the seat of chronic synovitis in an ad- vanced stage, but presenting a very different appearance from the foregoing. The synovial membrane, although vascular, is not fungous; and the cartilages, which have almost disap- peared, look as if they had been rubbed away by friction. The preparation is beautifully injected. E. b. 308. White swelling of the knee. The ulceration is here chiefly confined to the external condyle of the femur. E. b. 309. Great destruction of the original textures of the knee joint from protracted disease. E. b. 310. Knee joint, exhibiting the progress of white swell- ing towards anchylosis. All the original structures have been removed, and their places taken by a soft vascular materiel which is rendered very obvious by the bones having been pulled partially asunder. E. b. 311. A vertical antero-posterior section of the knee of a child, far advanced towards anchylosis. The spaces between the bones are quite filled up with a large mass of organized lymph. Injection shows its vascularity. E. b. 312. A vertical section of the knee joint of an adult, in a state of nearly complete bony anchylosis. Only a thin layer of firm fibrous tissue is interposed between the ends of the bones. It is remarkable that in this anchylosis the knee is bent

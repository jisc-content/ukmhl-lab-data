124 PATHOLOGICAL CATALOGUE. F. b. 202. Scrofulous disease of the testicle. F. b. 203-4. Diseased testicles removed from subjects in the dissecting-room. In each, the tunica vaginalis is adherent, and the spermatic cord enlarged and thickened; injected. F. b. 205. Preparation of a testicle which had been subject to inflammation, showing partial adhesion of the tunica vagi- nalis, and commencing deposition of tubercular matter in the glandular structure. F. b. 206. Another specimen of the same. F. b. 207. A testicle, the glandular structure of which is al- most destroyed by inflammation; the cavity of the tunica vagi- nalis is entirely obliterated ; the ulceration of the scrotum, with which it was connected, is visible on its external surface. F. b. 208. A testicle, from a venereal patient, which had been for many months enlarged in consequence of inflammation. F. b. 209-10-11-12-13. Testicles removed from patients, who died from the remote effects of venereal disease. F. b. 214. Hydatid disease of testis. This specimen was re- moved from an individual who died, dropsical, in Steevensâ€™ Hos- pital, labouring under an enormous hydatid tumour which oc- cupied the cavity of the abdomen. F. b. 215. A very remarkable specimen of disease of the lymphatics of the spermatic cord ; the testicle is enlarged, and the tunica vaginalis adherent, throughout. The patient died suddenly after a few hours illness. On examination, the chief morbid appearance discovered was, a sero-sanguineous effusion into the right pleura ; the lymphatics were easily distinguish- able previously to injection: those of the opposite cord were similarly affected, and were traceable into a gland near the re- ceptaculum chyli. F. b. 220. Fungus haematodes of the testicle. F. b. 221. Fungus haematodes of the testicle. F. b. 222. Another preparation of the same disease, injected.

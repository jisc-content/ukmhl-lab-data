In this preparation, too, there appears a fistulous opening in the pleura, by which the vomicae had communicated with the cavity of that membrane, forming there a phthisical pneumo-thorax. C. b. 11 1. The sixth specimen is one in which scarcely any- thing appears but one great anfractuous sac, lined with a layer of lymph: in which instance the poor invalid had had but little pulmonary tissue left, to carry on the function of respiration. C. b. 112. The seventh preparation exhibits the lungs, trachea, and larynx of a phthisical patient, in all of which the character- istic effects of the last stage of the disease are manifest. The former are either hollowed into great cavities or liepatized and tuberculated. The latter present an excoriated and ulcerated condition from the one end to the other. C. b. 120. The lung of a monkey (simia rhesus), exhibiting extensive tubercular development. C. b. 125. Portion of lung compressed by pleuritic effusion. The specific gravity is so great as to cause the lung to sink in water. C. b. 126. Dilatation of the bronchial tubes of the left lung. The patient was for many years subject to cough and profuse % expectoration. The bronchial tubes are hypertrophied, and the mucous membrane is opaque and yellowish. The intervening pulmonary tissue is compressed and atrophied. In the opposite lung there M'as extensive emphysema. The patient died of morbus cordis, with dropsy.—Dub. Hosp. Rep. vol. iv—Dr. Stokes. C. b. 127. Dilated air cells and sub-pleural vesicles, in a case of Lsennec’s emphysema ; dried. C. b. 128. Large sub-pleural vesicle, laid open. Its attach- ments to the surrounding parts have a downy appearance, and there is thickening of the pleura. C. b. 129. Fistulous orifice of an abscess which had formed in one of the bronchial glands ^at the angle of bifurcation of the trachea, and which opened into both bronchi. There are also

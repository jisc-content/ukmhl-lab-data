MOLLUSCA. Ch.—No skeleton—muscles all attached to external skin—nervous system situated in the visceral cavity, and composed of separate masses joined by nervous filaments—taste, sight, or, as in one instance, hearing, the only senses,—organs of circulation, respiration, and digestion very perfect. ARTICULATA. Ch.—No skeleton—two long nervous chords with ganglia at inter- vals—have usually taste and sight—divided into jointed rings, soft or hard, to inside of which muscles attached—sometimes lateral limbs, sometimes none—jaws, when present, always lateral. RADIATA. Ch.—Organs of movement and sense disposed circularly around a centre, not symmetrically as in the preceding—no visible nerves—no organs of sense or circulation—respiration performed by outward inte- gument—intestines often a simple bag—sometimes the animal is but a homogeneous pulp, without aperture or cavity.

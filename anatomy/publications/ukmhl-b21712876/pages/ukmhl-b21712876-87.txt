ORGANS OF CIRCULATION. 73 B. c. 58. Earthy and steatomatous depositions, in patches, between the inner and middle coats of the aorta. B. c. 59. Steatomatous and earthy deposits in the coats of the aorta. B. c. 60. Aorta, witli osseous and steatomatous depositions. B. c. 61. Another, of the same nature. B. c. 62. Thoracic aorta, incipient steatoma of. B. c. 63. Beautiful preparation, showing nearly a complete closure, by diseased thicking, of the aortic valves, from a gen- tleman about fifty, in whom the disease was not known to have existed. He died suddenly, one. morning, in an effort of pulling on his stocking, when getting up, as usual, to breakfast. B. c. 64. Another preparation, very like the foregoing, and of which the history is nearly the same. B. c. 65. Very large aneurism of the arch of the aorta. Its relations to the trachea, sternum, clavicle, &c. are well shown. B. c. 66. True aneurism of the arch of the aorta, from a female who died in the Meath Hospital, suffocated by the pres- sure of the tumour on the trachea See Dub. Journ. vol. iv. p. 313.—Mr. M. Collis. B. c. 67. Aneurism of the termination of the arch of the aorta, which proved fatal by bursting into the oesophagus. The details of this interesting and important case will be found in the same paper as the preceding.—Dr. Stokes. B. c. 68. An aneurism of the thoracic aorta which burst into the left pleura. The ribs have undergone absorption to a con- siderable extent from the pressure of the tumour. B. c. 69. Considerable dilatation of the arch and thoracic portion of the aorta, with ossific depositions over the surface of the vessel : dried, and preserved in turpentine. B. c. 70. Incipient dilatation of the arch of the aorta, with- out disease of the valves. B. c. 71. A mass of coaguluin from an aneurismal sac of the aorta. L

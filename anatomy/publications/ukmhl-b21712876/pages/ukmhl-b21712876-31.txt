17 ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. The tongue is short and immoveable. The opening of the larynx appears as a short narrow slit. C. a. 41. A beautiful preparation of the lung of a turtle, injected, dried by inflation, and preserved in turpentine, show- ing the course and distribution of the blood-vessels, and the % large size and free communications of the air-cells. C. a. 42. The trachea and lungs of a tortoise (testudo grceca, L.), prepared like the foregoing, but not injected. C. a. 43. Another section of the same, presenting another view of its organization. C. a. 45. Larynx, pharynx, and tongue of a crocodile (lacerta alligator, L.), showing the cup-shaped sucker of the pharynx, by which the respiratory organs are closed over and protected, while the mouth is opened in the seizure of prey, under water. C. a. 46. Tongue, larynx, trachea and lungs of an iguana (lacerta iguana, L ), beautifully injected and exhibited. C. a. 47. Trachea and lungs of a boa-constrictor. The trachea terminates abruptly at the lung. Anteriorly, the lung is formed into numerous cells, which open into a common central cavity continuous with the trachea: behind, the cells disappear, and the organ assumes the character of a serous bag. C. a. 48. Lungs of a frog (rana temporaria, L.), successfully injected. The air-cells are large, and communicate freely with each other. C. a. 49. A beautifully injected preparation, showing the heart and lungs of the frog, in situ. Many other parts of in- terest are shown in the preparation. C. a. 50. Os hyoides, trachea, lungs, heart and principal blood-vessels of the tortoise (testudo graica, L.) in connexion with the skeleton. C. a. 55. One of the gills of the angel shark (sgualus squatina, L.) injected. This preparation affords a good exhibition of the structure and form of the branchiae in cartilaginous fish. The D

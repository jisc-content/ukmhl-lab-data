A minutely injected lung of a child thickly stud- ded with miliary tubercles.—Mr. Cusack. C. b. 101. Section of a phthisical lung, injected, exhibiting tubercular deposits in the miliary and crude stages, with inter- lobular pleuritis.—Dr. Hart. C. b. 102. Portion of a phthisical lung, injected. Two tu- bercular cavities are here displayed, between which is a well marked example of encysted tubercle.—Idem. C. b. 103. Portion of a lung, nearly completely studded with tubercular matter, injected. There are some anfractuosities, and the pleura is thickened and coated with lymph. C. b. 104. Phthisical lung, extensively ulcerated, injected. C. b. 105. Another, very like the foregoing, injected. The seven following preparations present a series of succes- sive pathological changes, in several phthisical lungs, from inci- pient softening of tubercular matter to the formation of large vomicce. C. b. 106. A portion of the apex of a lung solidified, partly by tubercles, partly by pneumonic effusion, and studded with numerous incipient small anfractuosities. C. b. 107. Cavities somewhat larger but more empty, and one of them shown by a black bristle to have a direct commu- nication with the open mouth of a bronchial tube. C. b. 108. Another somewhat like the foregoing, but with the superaddition of a layer of lymph in the pluera—the result of a recent pleuritic attack. C. b. 109. A fourth. The number and size of the cavities, increased; and some of them partially communicating with the others. C. b. 110. A fifth; showing two large vomicae, with a free passage of communication between them—blood-vessels traver- sing the cavities protected by coatings of lymph—and bron-

ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. 97 E. a. 45. Left adult thigh bone, universally enlarged and roughened, and greatly increased in density and weight. The medullary canal is quite filled up by solid bone. E. a. 46. Right thigh bone of a very tall man, roughened on the surface, and increased in thickness and density. E. a. 47. Lower extremity of a left adult thigh bone, with a round button-like node a little above the internal condyle. E. a. 48. The right tibia and fibula of an adult, anchylosed at both extremities, and greatly hypertrophied: the tibia is nearly round and presents numerous fungiform nodules and irre- gular spicular projections on the surface : it is of nearly uniform density to the centre, and of great solidity and weight; it retains its straight form, but is at least an inch shorter than the fibula which projects to that extent beneath its lower extremity ; the lower extremity of the fibula is affected in a similar manner. E. a. 49. The right tibia and fibula of an adult, anchylosed together, and somewhat like the foregoing. The tibia is con- siderably bowed forwards. E. a. 50. A tibia, similarly affected, sawed down the centre, to show the obliteration of the medullary canal. E. a. 51. The right tibia of an adult, with a fusiform node in the centre of the shaft, and engaging the whole cir- cumference. E. a. 52. Another tibia, with a node on the upper*nd fore part of the spine. E. a. 53. A right tibia, with several irregular exostoses on different parts of its surface. E. a. 54. A left tibia of an adult, with an exostosis behind the inner ancle, on which are deep grooves for the passage of the flexor tendons. E. a. 55. Four fibulae, presenting different varieties of ex- ostoses. E. a. 56. The left humerus of an adult, the entire shaft of which is enlarged and irregular on the surface. o

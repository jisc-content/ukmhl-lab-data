ANATOMICAL CATALOGUE. 18 arch of the gill is covered on its sides and concave border by a firm, white, mucous membrane; and from its convex edge stand out the cartilaginous laminae, on which the beautiful vascular membrane, the seat of the respiratory function, is expanded. The continuity of this membrane with the general mucous sur- face of the pharynx is very striking; and its abrupt change of character is not less remarkable. C. a. 56. A portion of the gill of a sturgeon (acipenser sturio, L.), injected. The cartilaginous basis of the gill, and the trunk of the branchial blood-vessels running along its edge, are shown. C. a. 57. A single lamina of the gill of the frog-fish (lophius piscatorius), showing the course of one of the smaller vessels along its margin. C. a. 58. Gill of a lamprey eel (petromyzon fluviatilis, L.), closed over by the integuments, and communicating with the surface by seven apertures on each side. This preparation shows also the curious sucker-shaped mouth, the teeth, the brain, and the tape-like spinal marrow of the animal. The peri- cardium is also exhibited. C. a. 59. The branchiae of the common eel (murcena aguilla, L ), injected. The laminae are five in number, free at their external margin, and protected by a moveable gill-cover. C. a. 60. Branchiae of a mackerell (scomber scomber, L.), injected, and removed from the body. C. a. 65. Swimming-bladder of a conger eel (murcena congur, L.) dissected, in situ : its two layers separated. C. a. 70. Branchiae of a cuttle-fish (sepia loligo, L.) ; one of them injected, the other not. The delicacy and beauty of these organs can only be appreciated by a close inspection. The vascular laminae of the gills are arranged on each side of a cen- tral stem, like an ostrich feather upon its quill. C. a. 75, The gills of an oyster (ostrea edulis, L.). Four pectinated plates, situated inside the cloak, fixed by one margin, l

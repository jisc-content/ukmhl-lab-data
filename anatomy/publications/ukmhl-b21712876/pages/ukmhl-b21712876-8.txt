INTRODUCTION. VI On Midwifery—Dr. S. Cusack, Dr. Maunsell, Dr. Beatty and Dr. Isdell. On Medical Jurisprudence—Dr. Adrien, Dr. Geoghegan, Mr. Read, Mr. Gabriel Stokes and Dr. Forde. On Medical Botany—Pr. Corbet. On Diseases of the Eye and. Ear—Mr. Wilde. The Museum was formed out of the practice of these gen- tlemen, to bear out their views in medicine, and to illustrate the lectures delivered by them in this School. The Anatomical preparations have been made by Dr. Jacob, Dr. Hart, Dr. Carlile, Dr. Hill and Mr. Wilkin. The preparations in Pathology are gleanings from Steevens’, the Meath, Sir Patrick Dunn’s, and the Fever Hospitals, with which the lecturers have been all, in some manner, connected. To the liberality of Leonard Trant, Esq., Surgeon to the Cork- street Fever Hospital, and to that of many other gentlemen, who have politely contributed specimens from their private practice, the Museum is indebted for many valuable additions. This Museum, too, it may be observed, is the depository of several series of preparations illustrative of different important improvements and works in Medical Science. Here, for ex- ample, are the osteo-sarcomatous diseases of the lower jaw, re- moved by Mr. Cusack, and with which, as being published, in part, in the Dublin Hospital Reports, the profession are well acquainted. In this collection may be seen the specimens of disease, illustrative of Mr. Porter’s excellent work on the Larynx; of his article on Necrosis in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology; and of his deservedly esteemed Lectures on Aneurism. Here are Dr. Stokes’ preparations— those which he used at his lectures in this School, and which illustrate his great and instructive work on diseases of the chest. On the same and other subjects, too, are the original preparations selected and used by Sir Henry Marsh, Bart., and Dr. Graves, for similar and equally important, purposes.

11 ORGANS OP CIRCULATION. (lacerta chameleon). The structure and mechanism of these parts are beautifully exhibited. B. h. 40. The heart of an iguana (lacerta iguana), injected with size and Vermillion. B. b. 45. The heart of a frog-fish (lophius piscatorius), con- sisting of a single auricle and ventricle; the auricle is thin and dilatable, the ventricle fleshy and firm, the pedicle or root of the pulmonary artery is nearly as muscular as the ventricle. B. b. 4G. The heart of a scate (raja batis), showing the in- terior of the auricle and ventricle, and the numerous valves of the pedicle. B. b. 47. The heart of a cod-fish (gadus morrhua), prepared like the foregoing. B. b. 48. The circulating and respiratory organs of the cuttle- fish (sepia loligo), injected. The heart consists of three cham- bers, apart from each other; the two lateral, filled with blue injection, are pulmonary hearts for propelling the blood into the gillsâ€”the fringed bodies which appear at the sides of the pre- paration ; the central fleshy chamber is the systemic heart for propelling the blood, which has been brought from the gills, through the body ; the former being, in this respect, analogous to the right cavities of the human heart; the latter performing a function similar to that of the left. B. b. 49. The dorsal vessel of a leech (hirudo officinalis), injected with quicksilver. ORDER III. ARTERIES AND VEINS. B. c. 60. An unique and beautiful corroded wax preparation of the heart, principal blood-vessels, and thoracic duct of the human subject. The right and left cavities of the heart are exhibited of their natural form and dimensions : the aorta and all its branches as far as the carotids, brachials, and popliteals are shown of a red colour; all the veins of the body, to the

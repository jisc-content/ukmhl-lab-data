Compound fracture of the tibia extending into the ankle-joint, and demanding amputation after an unsuccessful attempt to save the limb. The joint is here preserved. The car- tilages of incrustation have disappeared from the bones, and their places are occupied by a layer of lymph : wet preparation. E. a. 241. The fracture in the tibia in case E. a. 240, with a soft organized line of union between the bones : wet prepa- ration. E. a. 242. Extensive fracture of the tibia and fibula in a man. The lesion in both the bones is in the line of junction of the epiphyses. Amputation saved life, after a fruitless attempt, for several days, to preserve the limb : wet preparation. E. a. 243. Frightful compound fracture of both bones in the middle third of the leg. Amputation was performed. The limb, preserved entire in spirits, exhibits the injury as it ap- peared during life. E. a. 244. Compound dislocation of the ankle-joint outwards, with fracture of both malleolar processes. The parts are pre- served in spirits, exactly as they stood at the moment of am- putation. There is a great rent in the skin, at the outer ankle, through which the loosened ends of the tibia and fibula pro- trude for about two inches. The limb is bent to nearly a right angle at this point, and the sole of the foot looks directly in wards. The preparation is, perhaps, unique. E. a. 245. Extensive compound and comminuted fracture of the tibia, showing the process of reparation at a stage advanced towards completion : wet preparation. E. a. 250. Thigh bone of a rabbit broken, in the centre, and re-united with much deformity. E. a. 251. The tibia and fibula of a bird, re-united by ossific matter, in moderate quantity.

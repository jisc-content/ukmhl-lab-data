60 PATHOLOGICAL CATALOGUE. A. c. 110. Another, the third stage, in which the tumor is opened up by ulceration. A. c. 120. Stricture of the sigmoid flexure of the colon : the surface of the mucous membrane ulcerated at the constricted part; the intestine dilated above the stricture, and much con- tracted below it. A. c. 121. Another specimen of stricture of the sigmoid flexure of the colon : specimen not injected. A. c. 122. Simple annular stricture of the rectum (perhaps venereal) from a female, aged 25, who died of fever, having had, at the same time, chancres high up in the vagina. A c. 123. Scirrho-contracted rectum : several fistulous open- ings were connected with cavities around the rectum, some of which lay in front of the sacrum, which was partly carious : bands extended across the cavity of the intestine. The subject of this case was a painter, who suffered excruciating pains in the rectum, at intervals. In one paroxysm, his suffering was so great as to cause him to throw himself into the canal, with the intention of committing suicide.—Mr. Porter. A. c. 124. Annular stricture of the rectum, rendered passable by ulceration extending from an abscess which had formed be- tween the bladder and rectum and opened into the latter. The intestine is much dilated above the stricture. The passage of solid fceces had been for a long time interrupted in this patient, but became free after the opening of the abscess. The stric- ture was too high to be reached by the finger. The mucous membrane of the bladder was fungated. This patient died, hectic.— Dr. Hart. A. c. 125. Pouch of a rectum, showing several cicatrized ulcers of the mucous membrane: preparation injected. A. c. 126. Intestinum rectum, everted, showing ulcers of various sizes, in a complete state of cicatrization. A. c. 134. Large external hemorrhoids; anus, unopened.

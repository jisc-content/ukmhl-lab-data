INTRODUCTION. The School of Medicine, Park-street, was founded in the year 1824. Lectureships were established in all the branches necessary for a course of Medical Education ; and a building erected, in character with such objects, containing a Museum, two Theatres, a spacious and well-ventilated Dissecting-room, a Chemical Laboratory, and every other suitable accommodation. The success of the Institution, as an experimental under- taking, being to depend, altogether, on the attractions offered in the way of instruction, the most experienced, only, were of course those who became associated in conducting it. And the simple mention of the names of such as have, from time to time, taught in its theatres, will sufficiently account for its success. The School has had as teachers— On Anatomy—Dr. Jacob, Dr. Hart, Dr. Carlile, Dr. Al- cock, Dr. George Greene, Dr. Denham, Dr. Hill, Mr. Young, Mr. Stokes, Mr. Wilkin and Mr. M'Donnell. On Surgery—Mr. Wilmot, Mr. Cusack, Mr. Porter, Mr. Houston and Mr. Fleming. On Medicine—Sir Henry Marsh, Dr. Graves, Dr. Stokes and Dr. Duncan.

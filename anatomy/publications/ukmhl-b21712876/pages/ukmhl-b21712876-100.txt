PATHOLOGICAL CATALOGUE. 86 lung itself also presented marks of encephaloid degeneration. This case was supposed to be one of tubercle of the upper lobe of the left lung Dub. Hosp. Rep. vol. 5.—Dr. Stokes. C. b. 144. Complete transformation of the right lung into a mass of soft cancer. In the centre, is a cavity communicating with the bronchial tubes ; and from this central cavity pass off numerous passages, opened up by ulceration, towards the sur- face of the lung, through which both fluids and air found a means of escape.—Stokes on the Chest. C. b. 145. Section of an encephaloid tumour of the posterior mediastinum, which compressed the lung downwards and for- wards. C. b. 146. Encephaloid disease of the posterior mediastinum, invading the left lung. The tumour displaced the lung, and compressed the trachea, oesophagus, and left subclavian artery. The pulmonary artery passed through its centre. Connected with the disease, there was a distinct diastolic pulsation— Dr. Stokes. C. b. 147. A vast deposit of cancerous matter, forming two great tumours j the larger invading a considerable portion of the left lung; the smaller extending to the right side. Ihe disease has completely surrounded the trachea, and has descended so as to compress the aorta, and partly to touch the right ven- tricle of the heart.—Dr. Stokes. C. b. 160. A cast from an adult individual, in whom there existed an unnatural, but not a very unusual, sinking in of the lower end of the sternum, giving rise to an unseemly depression at the pit of the stomach, which might be mistaken for disease. —Dr. Stokes.

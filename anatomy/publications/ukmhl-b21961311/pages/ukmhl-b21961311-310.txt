2(12 ANTLER OF STAG. seen enormous vessels separated by very thin layers of bony tissue. As we pass towards the circumference the diameter of Fig. 168. a Section of the antler of the stag near the tip of one of the cusps. T he centre is marked a. At the outer port. 6, the formation of Haversian systems is nearly complete, hat towards the centre enormous Haversian canals are occupied by air-vessels, black in the drawing. From a specimen prepared by Mr. White- X 20- the vessel becomes less, just as the ring of bone is seen to be in- creased in thickness, until near the surface of the antler the central cavity or Haversian Fig. 169. canal is reduced to a mere line. The vessel has wasted, and the blood has ceased to flow. Simi- lar changes gradually proceed in every part of the antler, which at length becomes a mass of bloodless and perfectly dead osseous tissue. This being cast off, is replaced by a new antler which passes through all its .., . „. f „ stages of development like the Haversian systems fully formed from the outer O J. part of Fig. Ills, but magnified 215 diameters, showing yjig that Pl"6Ceded it In 01'- lacuna; and canaliculi. F dinary perennial bone the vessel in the Haversian canal often becomes very small, but it is very seldom that it ceases to transmit blood or completely wastes. A portion of fig. 168, representing four Haversian rods near the circumference of the antler is seen in fig. 169. A longitudinal section of the antler will give the student a very correct notion concerning the arrangement of the

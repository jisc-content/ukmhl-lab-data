247 OF THE LACUNiE. The lacuna of osseous tissue, if examined extensively in the vertebrate class, are found of very various shapes: sometimes scarcely to be distinguished from the pores, of which they are simple fusiform dilatations; at other times large and bulky, and forming the point of junction of a great multitude of pores. Mr. Tomes has allowed us to represent the principal varieties which he has met with hi the human subject; and some re- markable ones from the lower animals are appended (fig. 147.) Fig. 147. I' V Form of various lacunie, and their pores:—o. Simple irregular cavities, without pores; from an ossiflca- tionof the pleura: b. from healthy bone of the human subject, b1. One of the outer lacuna; of an Haversian system, with the pores all bending down towards the H canal, c. Other forms from human bone, showing the lateral connecting pores. d. Prom the boa. External lacuna; of an H system, with unusually large pores dipping towards the vascular surface, d'. Cavity intermediate between a lacuna and a pore. t. Another variety from the same reptile.—From Mr. Tomes. But though varieties are occasionally met with, yet, in the true bone of man and mammalia, the lacunae possess a very constant form; being somewhat oval and more or less flattened on their opposite surfaces. The two surfaces look respectively to and from the nearest surface of the tissue and meet in a thin edge. As pores pass off equally from all parts of the lacunse, it follows that by far the greater number pass to or from the surface of the bone ; an arrangement admirably adapted for the transmission of the nutritious fluids which transude through the walls of the vessels. In fig. 145 the lacunae are seen on their surface; in fig. 146, on their upper edge. The lacunae have an average length of l J00 of an inch, and they are usually about half as wide, and one-third as thick.

ELASTICITY OF TISSUE. 159 shown by placing the tissue in a medium of much higher specific gravity than that which bathes it during life, when it will be found that although considerable sminking may have at first taken place, the particles of the tissue by reason of their elasticity will gradually return to the positions they originally occupied. Thus the softest textures may be immersed in strong syrup or glycerine, which are highly efficient preserva- tive media, without any reduction in volume if only we are careful to increase the density of the fluid by slow degrees, and allow time for the gradual expansion of the tissue after the reduction in volume which it has undergone in consequence of the osmose of the fluid from its interstices into the dense surrounding medium which of course ensued immediately it was introduced into the dense fluid. A knowledge of this fact is of the utmost importance to all engaged in microscopical researches upon the minute structure of the tissues.â€” See the method of preparing tissues given on page 57. Some tissues are specially valuable for their elasticity, as for instance the different forms of elastic tissue, and it is very remarkable that as the fibres or laminae of this tissue gradually increase by the deposition of new matter upon the outside, this last is so laid down that as it contracts and acquires consistency and firmness, its elasticity accords with *j;hat of the texture pre- viously formed, so that there is no puckering or irregularity or unevenness to be observed in any part of the fibre, which how- ever cm-Is up a little on the side opposite to that on which the new tissue was last deposited. In connection with the vascular system elastic tissues play a highly important part, and the due performance of the respiratory act is dependent upon the elasticity of the pulmonary textures. Indeed, to such an extent is this the case, that if the structure of the elastic tissue of the lungs becomes impaired by disease, serious derangement of the respiratory function follows. The elastic membrane con- stituting the capillary wall not only permits the occurrence of great alterations in the internal pressure of the blood without the danger of rupture, but allows varying proportions of nutrient fluid to escape into the surrounding tissues. The minute quantity of fluid which permeates the capillary walls when these recoil upon a narrow quick moving stream, contrasts remarkably with the large proportion poured out when the capil-

PLATE XIV, Kg. 121. Connective tissue forming a network of rounded cords continuous with tha areolar coat of a small artery. From the abdominal cavity of a frog, A part of the muscular coat of the artery is shown at a. A nerve is seen at 6 running in the external areolar coat. At c the bundle of nerve fibres are seen to divide X 130. p. 211. Fig.122. a Small piece of one of the cords represented in the upper part of Fig. 131 at c. Several nerve fibres are seen, and in the lower part of the drawing some very fine fibres, prcbably altered nerve fibres, are shown At e.another portion of a true but very fine nerve fibre is represented. From a portion of one of the finest cords inFig. 121, Nuclei with branching fibres are seen atd, and the distribution of theseis very similar to that of the fibres repre- sented in the lower figura/. X 700. p. 214 Fig. 133. b Development of young connective tissue, muscular fibres and nerve fibres, from beneath skin, back ofvery voung newt. The large masses of germinal matter gradually undergoing conversion into their dinerent kinds of formed material, conuective.tissue, nerve fibres, o, and muscular fibres, are well represented In the centre oT th-s drawing is seen a muscular fibre at the very earliest stage of itB formation a is a capillary vpsipI.

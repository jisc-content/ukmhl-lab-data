199 OF THE COAT OF ARTERIES. the sum of the diameter of the branches considerably exceeds the diameter of the trunk. Filaments of elastic tissue anasto- mose freely with each other. They are prone to break under manipulation, and the broken extremities are abrupt and dis- posed to curl up.—Fig. 107, pi. XII.; when many of these broken ends exist together in the same piece, they give it a very peculiar and characteristic appearance, which renders it almost impossible to mistake this tissue. The parallel fibres of the ligamentum nucha?, figs. 107, 108, pi. XII., of the vocal cords, of the ligamenta subflava, and other pure elastic ligaments, differ widely from the lax network of long fine fibres of elastic tissue present in the areolar tissue beneath the skin and mucous Fig. 109.

Both these forms are totally unlike the thin delicate longitudinal fibrous layer which lies just beneath the epithelium of an artery, fig. 109, and this again differs in important characters from the elastic tissue beneath, fig. 110. The circular fibrous coat of the larger arteries contains a number of very coarse fibres, and in this situation is often seen Fig. 111. Fig. 112.

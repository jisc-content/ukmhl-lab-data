STRUCTURE AND FORMATION 7G so far from there being any indications of cells from which out- growths are formed, the masses of germinal matter are con- tinuous with one another ; so that, in fact, the connecting pro- cesses or tubes are connected from the first, and, as growth takes place, the connecting tubes become thinner and thinner, being as it were gradually drawn out as the masses of germinal matter become separated farther and farther from one another, in the manner shown in figs. 11, 12, 13, and 14. Careful observation of one particular tissue at different periods of its growth will convince the observer that its forma- tion takes place in a very simple manner, and that the formation of all tissues exhibits much in common. At no period of the life of many tissues can the arbitrary definition usually given to the cell (cell wall, cell contents, and nucleus) be correctly applied to the elementary parts of which the texture is composed, nor in any case are such bodies first produced and then arranged in special positions and united together with a connective sub- stance so as to form a mass of tissue. Nevertheless the term "cell" is short and convenient, and it may be still applied to the anatomical elementary part of every tissue at eveiy period of its life, if the meaning be slightly modified. Instead of attempting to divide the cell itself into anatomical constituents, we may speak of it as consisting of matter in two very different states or stages of existenceâ€” matter which lives {germinal matter) and matter which is formed and has ceased to manifest purely vital phenomena (formed mate- ria I) (sec Introduction, page 11). The simplest and most minute living particle as well as the most complex cell capable of growth or multiplication consists of matter in these two states, but the relative proportions vary greatly at different periods in the lite of the cell and under different conditions. The physical and chemical properties of the formed material differ remarkably in different cases. In one case the formed material may be perfectly fluid, in another soft and viscid, in another of intense hardness, and in some tissues a comparatively soft formed material is rendered very hard by being infiltrated with calcareous or siliceous matter. We shall now briefly describe the general structure of the principal varieties of cells at different periods of their life, and endeavour to show how the fully developed forms in different

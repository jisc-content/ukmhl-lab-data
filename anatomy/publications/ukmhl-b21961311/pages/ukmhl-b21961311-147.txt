RED BLOOD CORPUSCLES. 125 a cementing or protecting substance, or bond of union, between separated parts, which serves as a nidus for the development of the masses of germinal matter which are to take part in the formation of a higher, more elaborate, and more slowly formed, but much more durable texture. It has been suggested that fibrin is required for the nutrition of a special class of textures, as the gelatin-yielding tissues, but we find fibrin in cases in which there are no such textures; and where these tissues do exist, they require such a small amount of nutrient matter, and undergo such slight change, that we should scarcely expect to find the proportion of fibrin, which exists when the formation of these tissues is complete, as great as it is. Nor is it probable that such highly important elements of the blood, as the white blood corpuscles, should take part in the nutrition of any one special tissue; and if upon other grounds than those advanced we were disposed to accept such a view, we should hardly be inclined to assign to such highly important and peculiar bodies the office of nomishing the lowest and simplest tissue in the body. Upon the whole, the facts known render it more likely, as has been before advanced, that the various masses of ger- minal matter of the several textures, form, from the same nutrient materials compounds different in structure, property, and composition; than that substances allied to the tissue to be formed, are simply selected, separated, and deposited from the nutrient plasma. There is indeed no evidence of the exist- ence of many different substances in the blood of man and the higher animals, in which the number of different textures and secretions is very great. Red Blood Corpuscles.â€”The blood of vertebrate animals con- tains numerous coloured corpuscles, which are known as the red blood corpuscles, and these contribute to the blood its most important characteristics. The red colour of blood is entirely due to these bodies, and the difference in colour between arterial and venous blood is caused by alterations occurring in the material of which the red corpuscle is composed. These corpuscles are probably derived from the white ones, so that the younger red blood corpuscles contain germinal matter, a fact proved by the circumstance, that in some instances, under high magm'fying powers, this germinal matter has been seen to

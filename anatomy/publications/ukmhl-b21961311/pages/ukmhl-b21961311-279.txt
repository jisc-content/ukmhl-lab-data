Bone differs from every other texture which has yet been brought under notice, in the important character that the formed material, matrix, or soft tissue, is impregnated with calcareous salts, which are intimately incorporated with it. A very firm unyielding tissue thus results, which, however, possesses a certain degree of elasticity, and although hard aud of great strength, is by no means brittle. It often withstands violent shocks without fracture, and being for the most part covered with soft tissues is in a measure protected; for the skeleton (bony or cartilaginous) of the higher animals, is in- ternal; it is clothed by the muscles and other soft parts. The first example of this arrangement is met with in the cephalo- podous mollusks, in which certain cartilaginous plates are enclosed in the body of the animal, protecting certain parts of the nervous system. The skeleton of the lowest organized fishes, although much more extensive, is soft and yielding, and is placed but little above that of the animals just referred to. It is composed of cartilage, which, however, in arrangement of its several parts, approaches the bony skeleton of the higher classes. Bone is the substance employed to form the internal skeleton of the osseous fishes, of reptiles, birds, and mammalia. It R

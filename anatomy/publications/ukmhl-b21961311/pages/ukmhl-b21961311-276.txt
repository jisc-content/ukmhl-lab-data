234 PAT IN CARTILAGE. masses of germinal matter. The formed material in then- immediate neighbourhood will be softened, and may even be appropriated by them. This state of things continuing, pus may result, or the masses of germinal matter not multiplying so fast as is involved by this supposition, may give rise to the formation of a soft pulpy formed material, like that of embryonic cartilage at an early period of development. These changes cannot be explained by what is called "irritation" nor are the cells " stimulated" to take up more nutrient matter within a given period of time than in the normal state, but the altera- tion depends simply upon the restrictions to the access of the pabulum to the germinal matter having been to some extent removed. Fatty matter is very often deposited from the germinal matter of cartilage. In some cases, the cavity in the matrix of the car- tilage seems to be entirely occupied by the oil globule or globules. In the cartilage of the ear of some of the smaller animals which are fat and well fed, the so-called cartilage cells appear to be occupied by globules of fat as large as those which are enclosed in the fat vesicle, pi. XV, fig. 132, p. 230. The process can hardly be regarded as morbid, unless the formation of adipose tissue itself is looked upon as pathological. In this as in many other cases, it is impossible to separate physiological from pathological operations. A similar change is not unfrequently seen in cases in which the cornea exhibits the arcus senilis, as was first pointed out by Mr. Edwin Canton, and often accompanies fatty degeneration of other tissues of the body. These phenomena are midoubtedly due to changes which must be considered morbid.

THE CHEMICAL CHANGES 100 most remarkable manner. Many have been placed by chemists in certain artificial groups, but hitherto it has not been found possible to arrange more than a very few in a naturally connected chemical series. The corresponding substances in different animals exhibit differences of properties and com- position ; and in disease, the characters and composition of the chemical components of the tissues and fluids undergo remark- able variations. Nor has any definite relation been proved to exist between the chemical composition, form, structure, and properties of organic, any more than inorganic bodies. Of the different Constitution of the Corresponding Substances in different Animals.â€”There are many modified forms of albumen, fibrin, and casein, several different varieties of starch, sugar, fat, &c, numerous different forms of hasmato-crystallin, biliary acids, &c, and the difference is not explained by the varying conditions under which these substances have been produced, but must be ascribed partly to these and partly to the different properties and powers of the germinal or living matter taking part in their production. We have already observed that the tissues which precisely correspond to one another in different animals exhibit minute, but still very appreciable, differences in their structure, and we should, therefore, be led to anticipate that differences in the arrangement of then* elements, and in their chemical properties, would also exist. Nor are these differences in chemical constitution confined to allied organic compounds, they are found to obtain also in the case of many inorganic salts. Chemical Substances composing the Tissues, not found in the Blood. The chemical compounds entering into the formation of the solid tissues and liquid secretions have not for the most part been detected in the blood or nutrient pabulum, and there is reason to think that they have resulted, not from chemical changes taking place while the solutions traversed vessels or permeated membranes, but that they are the consequence of changes occurring in the temporary or living state, through which, as has been already shown, the various elements of the food must pass before they form a constituent part of the tissues or nutrient fluids of living beings. The germinal or living matter is alone concerned in this process, and different kinds of germinal matter, although, as far as we can tell, having the same com-

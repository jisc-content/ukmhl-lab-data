179 TIIE UMBILICAL CORD. whole of the umbilical cord, a uniform distribution of the nutri- tive juices throughout the whole of its substance is in this instance also rendered possible."—See fig. 87, after Virchow. We have, however, quite failed to discover anything like the arrangement Prof. Virchow has described. This " mucous tissue," according to our own observations, consists merely of a soft form of connective tissue, in whicb the fibres correspond exactly to the fibrous tissue (intercellular substance) of ordinary Fig. 87.

After Virchow. tendon. The fibres with, the numerous nuclei are for the most I part arranged to form the boundaries of more or less circular A~ spaces.—Fig. 88, pi. X. In the spaces are seen more delicate fit fibres arranged without regularity, and the masses of germinal r.'lt matter are much less numerous in the central part of the space <i|t than they are amongst the fibres which bound it, for it is in it this latter situation that the formation of new fibres takes h\ place. The germinal matter (nuclei) of the older fibres dies, I.I and the fibrous matter itself is gradually altered and dism- al tegrated—some few fibres, however, with some mucous-like il matter, remaining in the central part of each space. The 1*1 circular spaces are gradually increasing in diameter as the I tissue advances in age, in consequence of the formation of new II tissue at the circumference. An elementary part, unit, or "cell," consists of an oval mass

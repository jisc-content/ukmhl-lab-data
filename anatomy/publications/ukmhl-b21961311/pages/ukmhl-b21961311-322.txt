It is not possible to demonstrate by the ordinary process of dissection, or by maceration, the points of ossification winch are first formed at a very early period of development of the embryo, but if the soft tissues be made transparent, every spot of earthy matter in the skeleton may be observed most distinctly as soon as it appears, and by condensing a strong light upon the various parts of the skeleton properly prepared, the youngest ossific points are beautifully seen.

Tims, in the long bones, fig. 178, there is a middle point, to form the future shaft; and one at each extremity, to form the articular surface and eminences. That in the shaft is the first to appear, and the others succeed it at a variable interval. The central part is termed the cliaphysis, and for a long period after birth there remains a layer of unos- sified cartilage between this and the epiphyses, as the ex- tremities are then styled.

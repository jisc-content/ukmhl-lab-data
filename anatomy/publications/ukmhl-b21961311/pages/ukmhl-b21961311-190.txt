162 DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTER however, remarkable differences in property in different situa- tions. One may be dry and firm, hard and resisting, forming a sharp point or cutting edge, as in certain kinds of nail and horn; another may be supple and elastic, like the epidermis, or soft and moist, like the epithelial tissue of mucous membranes and internal passages, while some forms of epithelial tissue are semi-fluid, or more or less viscid, of the consistence of mucus. In hardness and resisting power different forms of epi- thelium differ from one another as much as any one of them differs from other tissues. The student would scarcely believe that the soft, moist epithelium of a mucous membrane was in any way related to the hard dry tissue of which nail, horn, and hair consist, or to the hard calcified texture of shell, dentine, or enamel; but if he were to examine these textures at an early period of their development he would be convinced of their very close relationship, and would find that the formed material was produced in the same manner in all. It may be j truly said that one thing can scarcely differ more from another than the soft, moist epithelium of a papilla of skin or mucous membrane does from the firm cuticular tissue of horn or hah, and yet under modified conditions the former may become so altered as to constitute a tissue which any one would admit was closely allied to the latter structures. The fibre-like ceUs con- stituting certain forms of hair, horn, and nail are very different from other forms of epithelial tissue, but, as is well known, well-developed horns are occasionally produced on the skin, and the horny material consists but of modified epidermis. The long drawn out cells or fibres of enamel and dentine are probably. modified forms of epithelium, the formed organic matter of which has been gradually impregnated with cal- careous particles. Nor do epithelial textures differ from one another less remarkably in structure and physical properties than they do in function. The cell which secretes bile, or urine, or gastric juice would seem to be very far removed from the epithelial cell | of the cuticle or of a mucous membrane, for the former are instrumental in the production of secretions possessing very peculiar properties and containing much water, while the last produces only the dry homy matter which accumulates, or a softer material which, however, by gradual drying may be

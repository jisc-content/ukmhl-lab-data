294 COMPOSITION OF FAT. Fig. 191. favourable for the demonstration of the membrane itself. The fatty matter contained in the fat vesicle, even in the case of very hard fats like suet, is always in a soft liquid state while the body is alive. The softer kinds of fat were denomi- nated by the older anatomists pinguedo, lard; and the more solid sebum or sevum, suet, tallow. Hunter distinguishes four varieties as to fluidity; oil, lard, tallow, The elaine of human fat Lard melts at Fat vesiclCB from an emaciated subject:—a a, the cell-membrane; b 6 6, the Bolid portion collected as gj^d Spermaceti star-like mass, with the elaine in -t connection with it, but not filling ret;linS its fluiditv at 40° F the nell * 86° F. Tallow at 104° F. Spermaceti is fluid in a heat above 115° F., and solid at 112°. Oil is elaine with little or no stearine, as the neat's foot oil, obtained from the bones of the ox. In lard, the stearine is in abundance, but the elaine slightly predominates. In tallow there is a predominance of stearine. Heintz shoAved that human fat contained tripalmitin, from which palmitic acid may be obtained by saponification. The other constituents of human fat are stearine and elaine. The acids are the palmitic, stearic, and oleic. The composition of the fatty constituents in human fat is as follows :—Tripalmitin, C102H98O12, which corresponds to three equivalents of palmitic acid 3 (C32H3204) + one equivalent of glycerine (C6H806)- 6HO. Tristearin, CmH110Oi2, which represents three equiva-

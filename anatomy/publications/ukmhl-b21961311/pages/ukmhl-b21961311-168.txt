142 COMPOUNDS FORMED FROM THE BLOOD. Before any tissue can be nourished, certain of the soluble substances formed in the blood and held in solution in the serum, must permeate the walls of the vessels, and traverse the texture. The nutrient fluid having perhaps undergone, some change in its course, reaches the masses of germinal matter of the several textures, by which it, or certain of its nutrient con- stituents are taken up. Thus the germinal matter increases by the formation of new germinal matter; and the loss of that which has already undergone conversion into tissue is to some extent, completely, or in certain cases more than, compensated for. These processes in the healthy condition occur at a definite rate, but if the capillary walls be unusually thin, or be stretched, they necessarily become more permeable to the fluids passing from the blood; or if the soluble nutrient matters be formed in the blood in undue proportion, a greater amount of pabulum must pass to the tissues than is sufficient to compensate for the waste occurring. Consequently, under such circumstances, the masses of germinal matter increase in size. If this excessive proportion of soluble pabulum were not very soon taken up by the living germinal matter it would, at the temperature of the body, soon undergo decomposition, and the resulting products would, probably, very soon destroy all the living germinal matter in the neighbourhood, as well as the existing tissue. At the same time that the masses of germinal matter increase in size and number from increased access of pabulum, the tissue or formed material becomes softened and altered in consequence of being too freely permeated by the fluid. Changes affecting the quantity and quality of the soluble nutrient substances in the blood, and their distribution to the tissues, frequently form the starting point of many morbid processes which, after proceeding for a certain time, may cease, or be caused to stop, or they may be compensated for by actions of a different nature being excited in other parts; or, running on to a certain degree, the entire destruction of a tissue which cannot be renovated or replaced, may result. If a considerable extent of the tissue of some highly important organ as brain, lung, liver or kidney is affected, the patient's death may occur long before the changes have reached the degree to which they often attain when confined to a small circumscribed

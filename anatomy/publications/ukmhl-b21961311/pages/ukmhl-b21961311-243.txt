OF AREOLAR TISSUE. 207 The interstices are not, however, cavities possessed of definite limits, because they are open on all sides, and ultimately con- stituted out of a mass of tangled threads. The meshes which are formed are disposed so as to constitute secondary cavities, Pig. 117. Portion of Areolar tissue, inflated and dried, shewing the general character of its larger meshes. Each lamina and filament here represented contains numerous smaller ones matted together by the mode of prepara- tion.â€”Magnified 20 diameters. having a somewhat determinate shape and size, and which are visible to the naked eye. These sometimes contain fat, and may be admirably studied in most parts of the subcutaneous tissue. They communicate freely, as the smaller interstices do, their walls being everywhere cribriform, and capable of giving passage to air or fluids. Some forms of connective tissue are represented in plate XIII. In fig. 119 is a drawing from a specimen of connective tissue covering one of the voluntary muscles of the hyla or green tree frog. The capillary vessels with their fine nerve fibres and the networks of fine nerve fibres distributed to the muscular fibres are well seen. The masses of germinal matter (nuclei) of the nerves are not connected in any way with those belonging to the connective tissue. The three figures 118, 119, and 120, in this plate should be attentively studied with the aid of the explanations beneath. The areolar tissue is the most extensively diffused of all the tissues of the body, and its chief purpose seems to be that of connecting together other tissues in such a way as to permit a greater or less freedom of motion between them. To do this, it is

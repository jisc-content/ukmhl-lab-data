217 AREOLAR TISSUE IN THE BODY. tissue. 5. Germinal matter (nuclei) of fat cells. 6. Lymph, and white blood corpuscles. In certain papillae all the masses of germinal matter (nuclei) present, may be shown to belong to nerves and capillary vessels, and in the case of those between the elementary muscular fibres of the young mouse this is also strictly true. I do not think that in such situations, at least in young animals, there are any corpuscles which could properly be called connective-tissue corpuscles, nor have I succeeded in obtaining any facts which would favour the view that there are corpuscles of any kind distinct from the " cells" or " nuclei" (germinal matter) of the tissue, which perform special offices connected with the nutrition of higher tissues.â€”(L.S.B.) At an early period of development many tissues, as yet imperfectly formed, may be mistaken for connective tissue. Thus nerve fibres, muscular fibres, and capillary vessels often escape identification in the embryo. And as the masses of germinal matter, or bioplasm, which take part in the develop- ment of these tissues cannot possibly be distinguished from one anothei', they are sometimes all regarded as connective tissue- corpuscles.

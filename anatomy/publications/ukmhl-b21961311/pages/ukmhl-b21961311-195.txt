One of the simplest forms of tissue which is most widely dis- tributed among other tissues of man, and the higher vertebrata appears under the microscope to consist entirely of delicate fibres passing from one point to another. It has been already stated that extremely delicate fibres may be formed by every kind of germinal matter, and that these result from its death. The substance known as fibrin consists of fibres which interlace in all directions and which have been probably formed from matter produced by the white blood corpuscles, p. 123. A I white blood corpuscle, a mucus corpuscle, or other kind of I germinal matter may move onwards, leaving behind it a trail I of newly formed lifeless material consisting of a mucous-like I mass of delicate fibres. See Figs. 79, 80, 81, plate IX. Fibres of fibrin gradually acquire firmness by the closer I. approximation of the material of which they consist, and the I gradual expression from its substance of more and more of j the fluid existing in relation or combined with it at the time of I: its origin from the germinal matter. The gradual production I of these fibres may be studied under the microscope during the j coagulation of a drop of liquor sanguinis, plate V, p. 124, figs. 44, 45, 47. The germ consists, at a very early period, of masses of germinal matter only, but soon a very delicately fibrous formed material makes its appearance, and in this very simple texture the formation of the new tissues from the germinal matter proceeds. In the development of muscle, nerve, and most other textures a delicately fibrillated matrix may be distinctly

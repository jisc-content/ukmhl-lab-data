Tms edition of the original work of Dr. Todd and Mr. Bowman, has been prepared by Dr. Beale, their successor in the chair of Physiology and of General and Morbid Anatomy in King's College. His name therefore appears in the title page as joint author. Dr. Beale had already assisted the authors in the completion of the concluding part of their second volume, but for the work in its new form he is alone responsible. The present part, consisting of the Introduction, Chapter I. on Structure, and Chapter II. on Chemical Composition, is complete in itself. In the further prose- cution of the work, the original plan will be adhered to as closely as possible, but the text will be modified where necessary, and numerous new figures introduced. King's College, London. June, 1866.

306 FATTY TUMOURS. tion and disintegration of the fat which has been already formed alternating with one another. Abnormal Development of Adipose Tissue.â€”The xuiiform de- velopment of adipose tissue is sometimes disturbed, and in consequence of a circumscribed redundant growth, a tumour of enormous size may result. It is not uncommon to find this unusual growth springing from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the limbs or trunk. In one particular spot the circumstances which determine the regular and even growth of the tissue are somehow altered, and growth having once burst its ordi- nary bounds, continues unceasingly, and often at an increasing rate, until a tumour of large size is produced. The structure of simple fatty tumours exactly accords with that of normal adipose tissue, and the arrangement of the capillary vessels is precisely the same. It is possible that the formation of these tumours may be due to the circumstance of a collection of bioplasm, which would under ordinary conditions, form a lobule of ordinary adipose tissue, being displaced at an early period of its development. Subjected to the influence of unusual conditions, the little lobule grows very quickly, and once but a germ, soon becomes developed into one of those, often huge, morbid growths. Not only is the constantly growing fatty tumour like adipose tissue in its general characters, but in many instances the minute structure of the morbid growth could not be distin- guished from that of the normal tissue.

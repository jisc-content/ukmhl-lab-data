STRUCTURE OF THE CORNEA. 182 by pretty regular intervals, and from them a very soft tissue can be traced into the vitreous, of which it is, in fact, a part. The vitreous may therefore be regarded as a very delicate web, the fibres of which are combined with a considerable portion of water. The delicate fibrous tissue and fluid in its meshes bear to the masses of germinal matter the same relation as the formed material of other tissues bears to their germinal matter. The oldest part of the vitreous is that which is in the centre, while the circumferential portions were the last to be formed. The hyaloid membrane itself is probably but a highly condensed form of fibrous tissue of which the vitreous consists. CORNEA. The transparent proper tissue of the cornea is a modification of white fibrous tissue. It is composed of a number of branching fibrous fasciculi which are closely adapted to each other. These fascicvdi are for the most part arranged in laminae running parallel to the surface of the cornea. The fasciculi of one lamina are, however, continuous with those of adjacent laminae. The arrangement of the bundles of fibrous tissue is such that a net-work is formed, the fibres of which are so closely adapted Fig. 93.

The general arrangement of the fibrous tissue of the cornea and sclerotic is represented in fig. 93. Amongst the fibrous tissue of the cornea are situated the so-called radiating connective tissue corpuscles, or nucleated

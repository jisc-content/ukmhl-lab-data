132 THE CHANGES EFFECTED state confidently whether combination actually occurs in the tissue itself or is effected only through the agency of the masses of germinal matter so abundant in every tissue, and found in connection with the capillary wall. With regard to muscle it must not be forgotten that upon the surface of each elemen- tary muscular fibre are numerous delicate nerve-fibres, having many masses of germinal matter connected with them, and it is therefore at least possible that the process of oxidation may be taking place in connection with this tissue instead of in the interior of the contractile material, as is generally supposed. If the oxygen combines with or decomposes substances entering into the formation of the tissues, or immediately resulting from their disintegration, the process is merely a chemical one, and might, one would think, be imitated out of the body, but if only with matters resulting from the immediate disintegration of germinal matter, it cannot be so easily explained, and the change may perhaps be due to the elements coming into contact with the oxygen in some very peculiar state. If the fluids distributed to the tissues in which active changes are taking place are only imperfectly charged with oxygen, or if, although fully saturated, there be some impedi- ment to their free circulation through the tissue, imperfectly instead of fully oxidised substances result, which, from being insoluble or only slightly soluble, cannot be readily removed from the seat of their formation, and if these conditions inter- fering with free oxidation, persist, such insoluble compounds accumulate. Not only do such substances impair the action of the tissue in which they are deposited, but they interfere, to some extent, with the equable distribution of fresh nutrient material. In the process known as fatty degeneration the sub- stances resulting from the disintegration of the tissue under the influence of a too limited supply of oxygen, accumulate in its texture and seriously impair its action. In many cases not only is the existing tissue rendered soft and rotten, and prone to give way, but the process of formation of new tissue to take its place is partly or entirely suspended. The activity of the process of oxidation seems to be in- creased by the presence of alkali, as is well known to be the case with the oxidation of organic matters out of the body. In cases in which the quantity of alkali in the blood is less than normal,

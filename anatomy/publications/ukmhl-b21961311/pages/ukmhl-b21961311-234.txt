200 LIGAMENTUM NUCH/E. often spread out in a membranous form with numerous spaces or holes in it, figs. Ill, 112. Mi-. Quekett found that the large fibres of the ligamentum nuchas of the giraffe, exhibited transverse markings equidistant from each other, almost like striped muscle. These marks are not to be seen in all the fibres, and they are most distinct in the oldest. They do not extend quite across the fibre, but appear to arise from a sin-inking of the central part, which causes it to break up transversely into smaller segments, fig. 113. Pig. 113. Fig. 114. Largo fibres of clastic tissue, with well-developed transverse markings. Ligamentum nucha:. Giraffe. X130. Flakes from a large artery found in the stools, scarcely altered by digestion.â€”Natural size. See figs. 105, 100, pi. XXI. It is remarkable that fibres of elastic tissue from the sheep and ox, which have passed through the alimentary canal, without having undergone digestion, should sometimes exhibit transverse markings as distinct as those ordinarily observed in the fibres of the ligamentum nucha of the giraffe. In fig. 114 some flakes of yellow elastic tissue from an artery of a sheep or pig which had been passed by the bowels, are represented of the natmal size. Fragments showing the structure are seen in figs. 105 and 106, pi. XII. Vessels and nerves are to be demonstrated in some forms of advdt yellow elastic tissue, but even in the ligamentum nuchas they are very few in number. The yellow elastic tissue of the arterial coats seems to be noiuished by imbibition only, and is completely destitute of nutrient vessels. The nerves for the most part belong to the capillary vessels, except in cases where muscular fibres are associated with the yellow elastic tissue, as

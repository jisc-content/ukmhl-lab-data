-1'4 CONNECTIVE TISSUE. lage each " cell" is not marked off from its neighbours, but is represented by a mass of germinal matter, including a pro- portion of the so-called matrix, or intercellular substance around it. Some forms of cartilage are, however, really composed of " cells," which may be separated from one another just as in epithelium. The distinction, therefore, which has been drawn between different tissues, based upon the presence or absence of " cells " in the fully-formed texture, cannot be sustained. Dark Fibres in Connective Tissue.—In every form of the simple fibrous connective tissue may be seen certain fibres, some sharp and well denned, others somewhat ragged and irregular, which are darker and more highly refracting than the rest.—PI. IX, fig. 84. From the circumstance that the mass ofl the fibrous matter, of which fibrous tissue is composed, becomes, perfectly transparent when treated with acetic acid, while these darker fibres are unaltered by this reagent, it has been Fig. 85. " Connective tissue from the embryo of a pig, after long-continued boiling," x 850. After Yirchow. inferred that two distinct textures exist in intimate relation, with one another; the one being a gelatin-yielding substance, rendered perfectly transparent and structureless by acetic acid, the other allied to another form of fibrous tissue, the so-called yellow elastic tissue, which is not altered by this reagent. It has been maintained that the fibres exhibiting these different chemical reactions are formed separately,—that the gelatin- yielding fibrous tissue results from the " fibrillation" of an

175 JUICE-CONVEYING CANALS. intercellular substance, while the dark fibres, closely allied to yellow elastic tissue, are supposed to represent the cellular element of connective tissues. In some of the plans adopted for the demonstration of the supposed cellular element most important textures would be completely destroyed. Thus in fig. 85, taken from Virchow, and representing the connective tissue from the embryo pig after long-continued boiling, and supposed to show the connective tissue corpuscles imbedded in then basis substance, most im- portant textures, like nerves and blood-vessels, as well as the masses of germinal matter, taking part in the production of these, and of the white fibrous element, and of fat cells, and other structures, have been utterly destroyed by the process of preparing the tissue. It is unreasonable to suppose that any- thing can be leamt from examining the pulp of long boiled embryo skin, except the fact that of the many textures entering into its composition all are destroyed except the yellow elastic tissue. By such operations, as long-continued boiling, harden- ing in strong alcohol, drying, and the like, we cannot hope to gain anything but very erroneous ideas concerning the struc- ture, arrangement, and offices of tissue elements. Tube System of Connective Tissue.—Virchow has propounded the doctrine, that the fibres above referred to, and represented in fig. 85, which resist the action of acetic acid, constitute a Fig. 86.

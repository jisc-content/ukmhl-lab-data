Ossification generally extends in the direction that the future lamina? and Haversian rods are to assume, and which corre- sponds in a great measure to that in which it is designed that the chief strength of the struc- ture may lie. Thus, in the bones composing the vaidt of the cranium, there is always a very de- cided radiation from the most prominent part of the convexity of each, fig. 177. In the scapula this direction is indicated by the lines of shading in the accompanying fig. 179. The outline marks the limits of the temporary cartilage at the time, but these would have extended had the bone been left to mow. ° Vertical section of cartilage near the surface of ossiflca.

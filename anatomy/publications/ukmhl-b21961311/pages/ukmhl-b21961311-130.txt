110 CHEMICAL CHANGES OCCURRING AT The study of the circumstances under which these different classes of substances are produced by a single cell, and more especially the careful investigation of the conditions which determine a variation in the relative proportion of the different constituents, will greatly contribute to advance our knowledge of many of the most important morbid conditions, and thus give to practical medicine a stronger title to be considered a science. OF THE CHEMICAL CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE ORGANISM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT. Although we are quite unable to give even a very imperfect idea of the chemical phenomena occurring in man at different periods of his development, we shall make the attempt to employ the imperfect data we possess, and consider some of the most important chemical changes occurring in the organism from the point of view already indicated. At the earliest period of its development, the simple mass or collection of masses of germinal matter of which the embryo is composed, exhibits a chemistry simple as compared with that of the organism when its development is more advanced. The formed material resulting from the germinal matter, seems to consist principally of albuminous and fatty materials, without any substance capable of yielding gelatin. Saline matters may be detected, and it is certain that amyloid matter soon makes its appearance among the chemical substances produced in the embryo. The albuminous matter is closely allied to ordinary albumen, and with it is associated a small quantity of a coagulable matter, probably identical with fibrin. Fatty Matter.â€”Little is known concerning the actual chemical nature of the fatty matter developed at the earliest periods of embryonic life, but the compound substance known as myelin, makes its appearance very early. The oil globules so commonly seen in germinal matter of various kinds, especially at an early period of development, and which have been some- times termed nucleoli, consist of this form of very peculiar fatty matter. I have already shown that cholesterin, one of its constant constituents, is present in the oil globules found in various cells in fatty degeneration, and more recent examina- tions, with the aid of the highest powers, have displayed the masses of myelin, exhibiting then characteristic refraction, then

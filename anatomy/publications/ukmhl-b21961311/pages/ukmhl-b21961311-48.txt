38 OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES although the facts of the case compel the admission of inherent forces, acting as it were, from within living beings, the internal changes themselves have been attributed to the influence of pre-existing external conditions. The origin of a single, growing, multiplying mass of form- less, structureless, organic matter being admitted, it is said that countless modifications in structure and function of the masses resulting from it, and then descendants, are easily explained 1 iy the modifying influence of the different external conditions to which these must be subjected as the numbers increased, and necessarily became removed from the spot where the first concourse of inorganic particles, with its mysterious result, occurred. Of all the views ever advanced in this direction, those of Mr. Darwin, " On the Origin of Species, by the process of Natural Selection," published in 1859, have received the warmest support, and although we cannot attempt to give more than a very rough outline of this view, the hypothesis is so full of interest, and is so fertile of investigation, that we shall draw attention to it in few words, and refer the reader for further information to the work itself. The offspring of living beings, it has been truly observed, exhibit a tendency to inherit the characters of those from which they sprung. This is termed atavism. But there is also a tendency in the offspring to vary in certain particulars from the original stock, and an alteration having occurred is transmitted to the descendants. Now if it so happens that any of these modifications from the primitive type give advantages to their possessors over those which have them not, it follows that in the struggle for existence individuals of a species which vary in a way advantageous to themselves, possessing perhaps greater facilities for obtaining food, or greater power of resisting external destructive agencies, will survive and multiply, while their less fortunate fellows will gradually die out. In this way the former will be " naturally selected " from the latter, and by the strong tendency to inheritance, any variety thus selected will propagate its newly-acquired form. The tendency to the production of new characters, and the tendency to transmit these to the descendants, working through infinite time, must, it is argued, produce great differences in the character of the various

CHAPTER II. 03? COMPOSITION.—CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF GERMINAL MATTER AND FORMED MATERIAL.—SKETCH OE THE CHEMICAL CHANGES OCCUR- RING IN THE SIMPLE LIVING CELL.—CHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE ORGANISM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT.—OF THE "BLOOD.—OF THE CHANGES RESULTING FROM OXIDATION.—OP THE FORMATION OF VARIOUS COMPOUNDS IN DIFFERENT TISSUE8 AND ORGANS OF THE BODY.—THE CONVERSION OF PABULUM INTO BLOOD. Animal bodies are composed of solids, liquids, and gases, tlie last being held in solution in tbe Liquids. Solids and Liquids.—The solid textures contain only about one-fourth of solid matter, the rest is water. The great sin-inking which they experience when dried, shows how much of then bulk they owe to this combination; and parts thus shrunken swell out again, and assume then* natural condition on the addition of water. Nor does this swelling out after shrinking occur in water alone. The most soft and delicate tissues will regain their former volume, even if placed in very viscid fluids as syrup or glycerin, of much higher specific gravity than the tissues immersed. This seems to be due to the inherent elastic property in the tissue itself, in virtue of which its anatomical elements tend to assume the position and form they originally held in the natural state of the texture. The quantity of water existing, even in the hardest tissues, is far greater than would be supposed. The mummy of a large man is of very trifling weight. Blumenbach possessed the entire perfectly dry mummy of a Guanche, or aboriginal in- habitant of Teneriffe, presented to him by Sir Joseph Banks, which, with all its muscles and viscera, weighed only seven pounds and a half. Water is one of the most important constituents of animal bodies. It forms four-fifths of then* nutrient fluid, the blood; and it gives more or less of flexibility and softness to the various solid textures. The loss of it in great quantity speedily puts a stop to vital, as well as chemical and physical, action. Germinal matter is itself semi-fluid, and the veiy active move-

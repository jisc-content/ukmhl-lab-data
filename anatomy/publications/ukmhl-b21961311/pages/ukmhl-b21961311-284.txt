240 MOLLITIES OSSIUM. the earthy matter unduly preponderates. But this state can- not be looked upon as morbid ; it is the natural result of the feeble condition of the powers of nutrition, and the drying up and hardening of the tissues which ensue as age advances : and it will vary in different individuals, according to the original strength of constitution of each, and according to the freedom from exposure to debilitating influences. In that rare form of disease, known as mollities ossium, which occurs in adults, the bones are sometimes so soft that they may be indented by pressure with the finger. The nutritive pro- cesses concerned in the formation of the bone seem affected, for not only is the osseous tissue deficient in earthy material, but the animal matter is not in a healthy state, and in many instances fatty matter is present in unusual proportion. In these cases, the pathology of which is very obscure, earthy phosphates are often excreted in the urine in abnormal quantity. Analyses of the urine in two different cases are given below.* In 100 parts In 100 parts Analyses. of solids. of solids.

J The large proportion of earthy phosphate in these analyses is a very interesting fact. Iu the first, the earthy actually exceeds the alkaline phosphate; and, in the second, it is nearly equal to it. In healthy urine the alkaline phosphate usually amounts to from ten to fifteen times as much as the earthy phosphate. The inorganic salts generally, in these specimens of urine, were hi considerable excess. Bones possess a remarkable power of resisting decom- position. Even the animal part seems to acquire this power * See " On Kidney Diseases, Urinary Deposits and Calculous Disorders," by Lionel S. Beale. M.B., F.E.S. Third Edition, page 217.

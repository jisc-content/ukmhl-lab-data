166 NERVE TISSUE. is not unreasonable to conclude that currents, and, perhaps, of the same nature as those discharged by nerve organs, are set free. But perhaps the reason why these do not act in the same manner and cannot, indeed, be rendered evident, is this, that there is no continuous tissue along which the currents could be transmitted in definite directions and no peculiarly constructed apparatus adjacent to them which they could influence. It is probable that very slight differences in the molecular changes, which occur when living matter dies, determine the form or mode which the force then set free shall assume. Heat, light, electricity, or active movement being manifested according as the vital power operates upon the material particles of the germinal matter which are about to undergo change. But the nature of this action cannot be explained. It must be accepted as an ultimate fact, and the structure and the properties exhibited by tissue must in like manner be referred to the peculiar influence of vital power temporarily associated with the particles of hving or germinal matter without the agency of which not any kind of tissue can be formed.

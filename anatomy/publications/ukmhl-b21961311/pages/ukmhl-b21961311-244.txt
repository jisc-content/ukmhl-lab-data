2 OS AREOLAR TISSUE placed in their interstices, and is more or less lax, more or less abundant, according to the particular exigency of the part. This form of areolar tissue, at least in all the larger animals, invests the exterior of the muscles in a profusion proportioned to the extent to which these organs move as a whole upon neighbouring parts, of which the best examples may be seen, between the great muscles of the extremities; between these and their enveloping fasciae (not their fasciae of origin) ; under the occipito-frontalis muscle and its tendon; and in the upper eyelids. The areolar tissue is also present in immense quantities under the skin of most parts of the body, and especially where great mobility of the integument is required, either as a protec- tion to deeper organs against external violence, or to facilitate the various movements of the frame. Such are the regions of the abdomen, and of several of the articulations, and the eyelids. Around internal organs which change their form, size, or position in the routine of their functions, and which are wholly or partially without a free surface, as the pharynx, oesophagus, lumbar colon, bladder, &c., this tissue is abundant, and its filaments so long, tortuous, and laxly interwoven, as to admit of a ready and extensive motion on the neighbouring viscera. This tissue likewise forms a layer lying under the mucous and the serous membranes in almost every situation; though presenting great variations of quantity and denseness, it renders the movements of such parts easy. It also closely invests the exterior of every gland and parenchymatous organ, and enters more or less abundantly into its inner recesses, along with its vessels, nerves, and absorbents : but there is no doubt that it has been supposed to have a much greater share in the formation of this numerous class of organs than an ultimate anatomical analysis of them, conducted with careful precision, will at all warrant.â€”(T. & B. 1843.) In all these cases it is a more or less copious attendant on the vessels ; but wherever, either from the intricacy of the interlacement of the capillaries with the other essential elements of the particular organ, or the greater strength of these elements themselves, the firm contexture of the whole is provided for, while little or no motion is required between its parts, this interstitial filamentary tissue will be found to be

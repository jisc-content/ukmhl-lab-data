PERFORATING FIBRES. 2(58 Sharpey, who accepts the above explanation, which was first suggested by Loven, of Stockholm. (Quain's Anatomy, seventh edition, 1866. " General Anatomy," by Dr. Sharpey, page xcviii.) Perforating Fibres of Bone.â€”Dr. Sharpey has discovered some very peculiar fibres which perforate the lamellae, and as it were pin them together. These have been termed by him Fig. 171. Magnified view of a perpendicular section through the external tahle of a human parietal hone, decalcified. At a, perforating fihreB in their natural situation ; at b, others drawn out hy separation of the lamella? ; at c, the holes or sockets out of which they have been drawn. (II. Mllller, Quain's Anatomy, 7U1 cd.) perforating fibres. The holes through Avhich they pass are often seen in detached laminae. They are most easily demonstrated Lamcllrctorn off from a decalcified human parietal bone at some depth from the surface; a a, lamella?, showing reticular fibres; b b, darker part, where several lamella! are superposed; c c, perforating fibres.' Aper- tures, through which perforating fibres had passed, are seen, especially in the lower part of the figure. Jlagninea about 400 diameters, but not drawn to scale.

134 THE CHANGES EFFECTED BY OXIDATION. example, by subjecting certain complex chemical substances feo oxidising agents, bodies are obtained " in' which the number of the constituent atoms of hydrogen and carbon becomes pro- gressively less and less, until we arrive at bodies containing only two, and finally at bodies containing only one carbon atom." By oxidising stearic acid C18H360, with nitric acid of moderate strength, the following bodies are obtained :* Oxidation Products. Rutic acid ^10^-20^2 Suberic C8 Hu04 CEnanthic C7 H1402 Pimelic C7 H1204 Caproic C6 H1202 Adipic C6 H1004 Butyric Qt H8 02 Succinic C4 H6 04 It must however be borne in mind that no evidence has ye been adduced of the occurrence of this successive modifyin action of oxygen in the animal body. The chemist obseives in the laboratory that a substance under the influence of oxidising agents gradually descends in the scale of complexity as the oxygen successively burns off portions of its hydrogen and car- bon ; but it seems much more probable that the formation of the chemical substance in the animal body is due to the action of oxygen upon germinal matter, and that, so far from there being a series of changes, a highly, moderately, or slightly oxidised substance results, according to the conditions present when the change occurs. The facts of the case render the chemical view of successive oxidations untenable. There is no good reason for believing that starch as starch, sugar as sugar, or fat as fat, unites with oxygen in the body. The theory that several chemical compounds must be produced between the starch, sugar, or fat on the one hand, and the carbonic acid on the other, is merely a chemical hypothesis, for which as yet no very good grounds exist, since no one has produced these intermediate bodies by causing oxygen to unite directly with any of the above sub- stances, and such intermediate products have not been satisfac- * Odling's Lectures on Annual Chemistry. 1866.

ARRANGEMENT OP OSSEOUS TISSUE. 263 Haversian vessels, and the manner in which they are connected together by transverse branches, figs. 169 and 170. The draw- Fio. 170. Circumference, Centre. Loiifftitudinal section from the same specimen as fig, 10S, showing the communications between the very large vessels in the Haversian canals. X 20. ings have been copied from beautiful preparations which were made by our friend Mr. T. Charters White. The reader will now readily comprehend the apparently complex arrangement of the compact osseous tissue. Let us take for example one of the long bones. The entire vascular surface consists ofâ€”1, the outer surface, covered by the perios- teum ; 2, the inner surface, lined by the membrane of the medullary cavity and of the cancelli; 3, the Haversian surface, or that forming the cauals of the compact tissue, and having in contact with it the vascular network that occupies them, and which has been already described. These involutions of the surface are so arranged that no part of the osseous tissue is in general at a greater distance than Tj-g- of an inch from the vessels that ramify upon them. There is a layer of tissue upon the exterior of the bone deriving its nourishment from the periosteum, and which may be called the periosteal layer. The periosteal pores of the super- ficial lacunae of this layer open upon the surface. There is another layer, forming the immediate wall of the medullary cavity, and termed the medullary layer. Its lacunas, in like manner, face this cavity ; and the pores of the inner ones open upon it. This layer may be said to be folded so as to invest the 1>I.ties and fibres of the cancelli; and all the lacunas of these

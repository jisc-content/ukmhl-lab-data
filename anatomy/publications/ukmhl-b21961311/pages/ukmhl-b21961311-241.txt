205 MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERS. every possible direction. These are of two kinds. The first are chiefly in the form of bands of very unequal thickness, and inelastic. Numerous streaks are visible in them, not invariably parallel with the border, though taking a general longitudinal direction. These streaks, like the bands themselves, have a wavy character, but they are rendered straight by being stretched. The streaks seem to be marks depending upon longitudinal creasing, rather than the result of a true separation of the texture into actual threads. It is impossible by any art to tear up the band of fibrous tissue into filaments of a deter- minate size, although it manifests a decided tendency to tear lengthwise. The larger of these bands are often as wide as of an inch; they branch, or unite with others, here and Zo 0 Fig. 115. Fio. 116.

242 COMPACT AND CANCELLATED TISSUE. Fig. 144 Compact Tissue and Cancellated Structure.â€”In examining a section of almost any bone, we observe two varieties of osseous substance: the one dense, firm, compact, always situated on t7ie exterior of the bone, either as a thin layer, or as a dense, thick structure possessed of great strength; the other loose, reticular, spongy, arranged so as to exhibit spaces or cells, which com- municate freely with each other, and which, being called cancelli, give to this kind of osseous tissue the name cancellated. These cancelli are formed by an interlacement of nume- rous bony fibres and lami- nas, which, although to a superficial observation exhibiting an indefinite arrangement, have never- theless, in those bones which have to support- weight, a more or less perpendicular direction. The cancellated struc- Vcrtical seotion of tho upper end of tho Femur, showing the tUre of bone is always cancellated and compact tUeue,. situated in its interior, enclosed and protected by the compact tissue. The relative situation of these varieties may be well seen in a vertical section of one of the long bones (fig. 144). At the extremities, the cancellated texture is accumulated, invested by a thin lamella of compact tissue, giving expansion and light- ness to those parts of the bone. In the intermediate portion, or shaft, the compact tissue is highly developed, affording great strength in the situation where that quality is the most needed. The compact external surface of bone (except on its articular aspects) is covered by a firm tough membrane, termed the periosteum, which, like the perichondrium investing cartilage, consists of white fibrous tissue, densely interwoven in all directions (see page 269). The cancelli are filled with fat, or medulla, the marrow of bone. They are lined by a delicate membrane, called the medullary membrane, which serves to

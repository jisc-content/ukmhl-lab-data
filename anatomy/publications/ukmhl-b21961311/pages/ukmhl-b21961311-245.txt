PLATE XIII. Fig. 118. Simple fibrous connective tissue from the subperitonial connective tissue of a kitten two days old. Two fibres of yellow elastic tissue are seen. The proportion of germinal matter is very considerable. The manner in which the masses separate and form the intervening fibrous tissue is well shown X 215. p. 20*. Fig. 119. a. Connective tissue covering part of the mylohyoid muscle of the by la or green tieta trog, a. Capillary vessels, with their nerve-tibres. 6. Bundles of fine dark-bordered nerve fibres, from which fine pale nerve fibres may be traced to the capillaries, and to their distribution in the connective tissue, where they form networks of exceedingly fine but nevertheless compound fibres. This drawing shows the arrangement of nerves in voluntary muBCle ; the muscular fibres having been removed, the course of the nerves can be readily traced. Magnified 70C diameters and reduced to 110. p 207. Fig. 120. Cuuufcdive tissue, i'rora the submucous aieolur tissue Adult humitu subject. The masses of germinal matter taking part in the formation of tbo yellow elast ic tissue, as well as those concerned in the production of the white fibrous element, are well seen. X "00. p, 207.

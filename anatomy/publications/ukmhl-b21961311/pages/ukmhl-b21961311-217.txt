The few vessels and nerves distributed to this tissue, pass amongst these bundles, which in ligaments and tendons run parallel to one another, so that in a Fig. 95. Fig. 96.

In fascia, the bundles cross one another at different angles and form flattened bands. Physical Properties.—White fibrous tissue is inelastic, and, under ordinary circumstances, inextensible ; though it does admit of being somewhat stretched by the influence of long-continued and slowly-acting force, as is seen occasionally when an effusion of fluid has taken place into an articular cavity, protected by a firm, fibrous capsular ligament, or where a tumour has slowly grown under a fascia. Its force of cohesion is the most valuable I and characteristic quality of the white fibrous tissue, and to I this its various important uses are chiefly due. Mascagni cal- I culates the force requisite to rupture the tendo Achillis as equal I to 1,000 pounds' weight. Instances are constantly seen where I muscles are torn or bones fractured, while the tendons or I ligaments, through which the force has acted, have escaped; I thus the malleoli are often dragged off by twists of the foot I acting on those processes of bone through the lateral ligaments I of the joint. It is entirely devoid of contractility or irritability; I and its sensibility is very low, so much so that tendons hanging

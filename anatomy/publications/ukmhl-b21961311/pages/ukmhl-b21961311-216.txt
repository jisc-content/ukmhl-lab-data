184 WHITE FIBROUS TISSUE. It is doubtful if any actual tubes or cavities exist in the cornea during life, but by the arrangement above indicated, the corneal tissue is rendered much more permeable to fluids than ordinary fibrous tissue is. Fig. 94. Corneal corpuscles, and nerve fibres j Cornea of the green tree frog. The former are seen to be unconnected with the nerve fibres, x 360. The nerves ramify in the proper substance of the cornea amongst the ramifications of their cells, but are not connected with them. The relation of the germinal matter of the corneal corpuscles to the nerve fibres is represented in fig. 94. WHITE FIBROUS TISSUE. Tendons, ligaments, and fasciae, owe their firmness and unyielding properties to the white fibrous tissue of which they are composed. This white fibrous tissue is very widely distributed, but it differs materially in character in different parts. The three structures above named are all composed of white fibrous tissue, having well-marked characters. Cylindrical bundles, consisting of finer fibres varying somewhat in diameter, are bound together with indefinite or simple fibrous connective tissue, to constitute quarter of an inch, so as to enter the lamellated tissue, care being taken not to perforate the cornea. A small globule of mercury may now be introduced into the channel which has been made, with the aid of a glass tube drawn off to a capillary orifice. A knife is to be applied to the aperture of the wound made in the cornea in such a way as to prevent the escape of the globule of mercury which at the same time is to be firmly pressed into the corneal tissue. It soon spreads and may then be made to pass to every part of the cornea. Some other forms of fibrous tissue may be injected by the same plan, but the spaces filled are not so regularly arranged as those in the cornea.

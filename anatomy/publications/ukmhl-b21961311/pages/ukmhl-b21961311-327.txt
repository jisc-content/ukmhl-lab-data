PEVF.LOFMKNT OF EON 15. PLATE XIX. Fig. 132. Fig. 155. Ossifying cartilage and formation of temporary spongy bou? (a), from tbe scapula of the human foetus at, the fifth moa:h In the crypts or spaces of the temporary bou» are Been numerous bioplasts, which are probably descendants of tbe bioplasm of tbe temporary cartilage, 6, A capillary vessel X 130. pp. 278, 383. Tie. 133. A portion of cancellated structure with contents of the •* cancelli " from the first phalanx of the great toe of a girl about Ifi years of age. a. portion of the fully formed osseous tissue. About the central part of the figure is a spot -where it -would appear that the bone is being gradually removed. On a line with 6 are several bioplasts with matrix which has not yet undergone calcification, c. a capillary vessel with bioplasta. d. the soft material round the bioplasts has a slightly fibrous character. * and/, collections of bioplasts from which the bony plates and spicules of tbe cancelli are formed. These are the so-called '* myeloid cells.' X 700. p. 271. Fig. 184. two lacunae; and h the periosteum, a at the 5th month ii of tbe permanent e drawing are seen culi filled with air Another drawing from the same specimen as that represented in Pig. 183. Two lacunas with their canalicnli are seen to contain air. The shell of bone yet formed ia so thin that portions of cancelli are included in the specimen and one cancellus, n, is entirely occupied with bioplasts. The permanent bone in- creases by the formation of new bone tissue immediately beneath the periosteum, at a a X 300. p. 283. of a a inch x 120 x 700. [To face page 27S.

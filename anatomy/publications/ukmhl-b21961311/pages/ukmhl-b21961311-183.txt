ALTERATION OF FORMED MATERIAL IN DISEASE. 155 of an alteration occurring in the masses of germinal matter, the tissue is no longer permeated, or permeated irregularly, by these currents of fluid, most important changes soon result. The products of decay not being carried off as fast as they are formed, and not being converted into readily soluble sub stances, accumulate, and seriously interfere with the action of the tissue already formed. Such is, in part perhaps, the expla- nation of the changes -which occur in the formed material of various cells and elementary parts, which are said to be affected by degeneration. The formed material of tissues is also sometimes modified in consequence of being bathed with fluids of composition different to that which obtains in the healthy state, and this lalteration in composition may be due, in part, to the characters of the pabulum, and partly to the conditions under which its [ preparation is earned on, or as frequently happens, to the ! circumstance that certain excrementitious compounds, which _l ought to have been entirely eliminated, remain in the fluid. The character of the formed material will also be influenced ". I by the rate of its formation, and this will, to some extent, if depend upon the amount of pabulum which reaches it, and jilwhich, of course, varies much in different cases. In the preparation of this chapter, the Author as received much valuable help from his friend and colleague, Professor Bloxam.]

THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF MAN. INTRODUCTION. The aim. of all natural knowledge is to ascertain the laws which control and regulate the phenomena of the universe. So numerous, and so diversified are these phenomena, that for their study a division of labour has been found not merely convenient, but absolutely necessary. The position and movements of the planetary system, the crust of the earth, and its various com- ponent strata, the treasures hidden in its womb, the abundant vegetation that grows upon its surface, or beneath its waters, and the numberless hosts of animals that dwell upon the land, or in the rivers, lakes, and seas form separate branches of scien- tific investigation, between which a sufficiently distinct line of demarcation is established by the nature of the objects of inquiry peculiar to each. But, in all departments of science, the same general rules for conducting the investigation prevail, and it is only by a close adherence to these that we can arrive at safe and satisfactory conclusions. In any scientific inquiry, the first step must be to form a general notion of the characters and properties of the objects of investigation. In the next place, it is necessary to observe carefully the phenomena which they naturally present; and, if they be within our reach, to produce such variation in them by artificial means (by experiments), as may serve to throw B

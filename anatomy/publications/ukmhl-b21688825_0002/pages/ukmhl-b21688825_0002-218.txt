160 OF RESPIRATION. It is plain by these expressions of admiration that I do not mean to attempt so difficult a subject as this at present : 1 only mention difficulties which it is surprising that others have not declared and investi- gated, for nothing can be more interesting. The little that we do know shall be simply and plainly told. The forms of insects are often very strange, their lives very irregular, sometimes in water, sometimes in air; many of them begin in Worms, and end their lives as Flies and Moths ; and according to these varieties of their form, or life, or generation, their air-tubes are various. Sometimes, as in the common Bee, they have nearly' the form of lungs: They begin like two bags, resem- bling those of the Alga Marina, or sea-weed, in shape; and these bags distribute pulmonary tubes, with oc- casional bag-like dilatations in the course of the tubes, through all the body. More commonly the air-tubes of insects are direct tubes, mere tracheas, of a very singular construction; they have rings like the tracheas of animals; they have a delicate membrane cover- ing these rings and forming them into a tube : the tube continues always rigid like a flexible catheter, or other tube of twisted wire not liable to collapse: rl hey begin by many open mouths opening along the sides of the insect, and they terminate in myriads of vessels, which, in their forms and progress over the various parts of the body, resemble blood-vessels more than it is easy to conceive. These air-tubts being thus rigid, are always full of air, and by their refractions through the transparent parts of the insectâ€™s body they give it in the microscope a great degree of bril- liancy ;

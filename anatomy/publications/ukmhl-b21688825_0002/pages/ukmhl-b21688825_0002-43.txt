5 OF THE HEART. ' ter, they can also live at least as long after you have cut off their heads, or cut out their hearts. Of those cold-blooded creatures always either the heart or the arteries are peculiar; the heart is so in many amphibia, as in the Turtle, where the heart seems to consist of three ventricles, but with parti- tions so imperfect betwixt them that they are ab- solutely as one: this one ventricle gives out both the great arteries; the blood of the lungs and the blood of the body are both mixed in the heart; and since there are two arteries conveying this mixed blood, if the two arteries be nearly equal in size, then it is just onehalf oftheblood thrown out by the heartat each stroke that receives the benefit of the luno-s. In O many others, as the Frog, the Newt, the Toad, the peculiarity is in the arteries alone ; they have one sin- gle and beautiful heart; there is one large auricle as a reservoir for all the blood both of the body and of the lungs; there is one neat, small, and very powerful ventricle placed below the reservoir, having strength quite sufficient for moving both the blood of the lungs and the blood of the body; and this ventricle gives off an aorta, which soon divides into two branches, one for the body and one for the lungs; and these of course have but half the blood of this heart exposed to the air: these also are cold-blooded animals. But all breathing creatures, such as are called animals of hot blood, have two hearts: the one heart is sending blood through the lungs while the other heart is pushing its blood over the body ; not the half only, but the whole blood which is sent by each stroke ofthe heart over the body must have first passed through B 3 the

OF THE ARTERIES 398 arteria branch round the back of the little finger named dorsalis ulnaris. ARTERIA DORSALIS ULNARIS. The dorsalis manus ulnaris is a small branch which goes off from the ulnar artery as it advances towards the wrist. The ulnar artery goes forwards towards the pisiform bone, while this little artery turns- off about two inches below, passes under the tendon of the flexor ulnaris, and round the head of the ulna, to the back of the hand; it then goes upwards along the back of the little finger, where it ends. It gives branch- es as it passes along to the pronator quadratus, to the extensor ulnaris, to the joints about the lower part of the wrist, and especially to the joining of the radius with the ulna; and it finishes on the back of the hand by arteries given to the tendons and capsule, by inos- culations with the rete which is formed upon the back of the wrist, by the radial artery, and by giving the dorsal artery of the little finger. Next the ulnar artery, before it begins its arch, gives small branches to the flexor tendons and fore- part of the wrist; others to the pisiform bone, to the annular ligament, and to the palmaris cutaneus, and then branches to the flexor, abductor, and adductors of the little finger; or, in other words, to all that mass of muscular flesh which surrounds the root of the little finger; and still before it begins to bend into an arch, and just beyond the pisiform bone, it gives^ off that branch which maybe called arteria palma- ris profunda.

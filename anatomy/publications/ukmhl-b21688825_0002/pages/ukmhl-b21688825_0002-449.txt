OF THE FOREARM. 381 This short description involves many points which the surgeon should think of, and more than can be touched upon in this place. The following conse- quences certainly follow from this arrangement of parts. First, The artery lying thus deep under the biceps, cannot be hurt by any skilful surgeon, though bleed- ing the very vein under which it beats, and at the most critical point ; it is hurt, as far as I have observed, only by the rudest stroke of very ignorant fellows ; I have seen in six cases a wound in it little less than a quarter of an inch in length. In one of the operations I found it absolutely transfixed; the blood had been poured out from the orifice behind; I felt with sur- prise the artery running over the tumor, not under it; and having opened the sac, I passed a probe through the artery from side to side. Secondly, Since the artery divides Only after it has gone deep, where its great branches are protected by the muscles of the forearm, the trunk only is wounded in bleeding; the branch is never wounded; and we cannot but be surprised that Hunter, Haller, Sharp, and others, who ought to have studied this point, be- lieved it to be sometimes at least wounded in one of its branches ; nor can we think, without surprise, of the arteries being so little understood in the time of Hr. Monro the Father, that he is forced to argue the propriety of doing the operation of aneurism from this fact, â€œ That though it were dangerous to trust to the common anastomosis round the elbow, yet it sometimes happens, that the two branches of the ra- dial

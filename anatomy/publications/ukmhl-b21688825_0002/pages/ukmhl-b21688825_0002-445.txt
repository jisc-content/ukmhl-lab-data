GE THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. srr joint: for as the humeral artery advances towards the bend of the arm, it begins about three inches above it, to give off sidewise, and almost at right angles with the trunk, three or four small arteries, more or fewer, according to the size of the arm. Each of these sends its little twigs round the condyle, to inosculate with the arteries of the forearm both radial and ulnar. Among these one is distinguished for its size and im- portance j it is one of the largest of these arteries, and thence named anastomotic us magnus ; it arises from the Humeral artery about three inches above the joint; it lies close by the side of the brachialis internus, and gives many branches to it and to the triceps; but it is chiefly expended in three branches, one of which turns backwards, and running up the arm gives branches to the muscles, and inosculates with the profunda: another goes downwards towards the middle of the bend of the arm, and gives branches to the pronator teres and the flexor digitorum ; and then going deep- er, it touches the capsule, and makes a beautiful inos- culation over the forepart of the joint with the ra- dial recurrent or inosculating artery : another branch, the most important, and the chief termination of the artery, runs down betwixt the olecranon and the con- dyle, in the hollow where the ulnar nerve lies. It first contributes to that npt-work of inosculations which covers the back of the joint over the olecranon ; it in- osculates very freely with the recurrens ulnaris ; and it is this inosculation that gives the arterv its impor- tance and its name. This is the channel through which the blood goes after the operation for the anuerism, as we know from preparations ; and I have several times

OF THE ARTERIES. 400 they are so uniform in all points: It is sufficient to observe, that a long and slender artery runs along each edge of each finger; that generally at each joint or division of the finger the two arteries make arches to meet each other across the hollow where the tendons lie, supplying the tendons and ligaments at the same timeand that the fork of each digital artery receives a branch from the deeper arch of the palm. That the arteries are each accompanied with corresponding nerves, one for each side of each finger; for the ul- nar nerve accompanies the ulnar artery down the fore- arm, and branches along with k in the palm into the form of an arch, with three1 branches; which three branches are afterwards divided like the arteries, each into two twigs at the roots of the fingers. The superficial palmar arch finishes with a small branch, which makes another inosculation at the root of the thumb with that superficial palmar branch which comes off from the artery of the thumb, near the place where the artery of the forefinger also comes off. ARTERIA INTEROSSEA.. The interosseous artery is, after the radial and ulnar, the last of the arteries of the forearm. It is but a branch of the ulnar; it arises from the ulnar just where it lies in the very deepest part of the arm, touches the interosseous ligament. This artery is named interossea communis, because of two lesser interosseous arteries into which it divides. First the interossea communis divides about an inch below

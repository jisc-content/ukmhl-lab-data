481 OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY- miiis muscle, crosses behind the head or rather neck of the tibia, on the inner side of the knee. It first gives arteries to the back of the joint; then it com- municates downwards with a large recurrent artery from the tibialis antica ; it inosculates upwards with the articularis superior interna *, it contributes (as all the other articular arteries do) to the forming of that profuse net-work of arteries which is spread over the whole of the capsule of the knee-joint. It sends also, like the others, certain twigs, which creep under the internal lateral ligament, and go into the cavity of the joint along the borders of the semilunar cartilages. Those who write on aneurisms of the ham talk much of these arteries. They compare them with the recurrents of the arm ; and think, when they see five articular arteries, that it is a sure sign that at such a point all is safe; when really these arteries cannot be of the smallest service. They are all destroyed by the long compression of the popliteal aneurism, or are in- gulphed in the bag of the aneurism. If they ever* appear, it is not as inosculating arteries, ensuring the safety of the limb ; but as small branches bursting in- to the sac, embarrassing the operator, and confounding every thing, sometimes filling the sac a-new with blood, after all was thought to be quite safe, and the patient laid in bed. Before the popliteal artery passes under the head of the soleeus,it gives two long arteries, which rundown upon the two heads of the gastrocnemii muscles. It often also sends small twigs to the head of the sokeusq and to the popliteal and plantar muscles. Vol. II. I i OF

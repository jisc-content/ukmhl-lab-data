114 OE THE BLOOD. grows extremely florid ; and whenever it changes its colour, it is by absorbing oxygene, for it reduces in the same proportion the quantity of air; what it ab- sorbs is the oxygene or pure air, what it leaves is me- phitis, unfit for combustion or animal life*. Biood when exposed to the air becomes red chiefly on "he surface, it remains black beneath, but by turn- ing up the clot to the air all the surfaces become red. If air be blown into a tied vein, the blood which was black in the vein becomes florid ; and when the air is pressed out again, it becomes black If the air-pump be exhausted over a dish of blood, the blood becomes dark, in the vacuum; and it becomes florid when the air is allowed to rush in again. If you expose blood in a moist biadder, the blood is oxygenated through the wails of the bladder; which brings this experiment as close as may be to the phenomenon of blood oxyge- nated through the walls of the lungs. Though serum or milk be interposed, orurine, still the blood is oxy- genated, because these are perfect animal fluids ; but it is not oxygenated if oil, mucilage, or mere water, be interposed. When we open a Frog, or Newtf, or other amphibi- ouscreature, we see along and slender artery, accom- panied by a slender vein, running from top to bottom along the whole surface of their lungs ; and while their heart continues to beat, we see this pulmonic * artery black, tue vein red, the lungs themselves most * Mr, Beddoes, in his lasr Book, makes hydrocarbon as effec- tual in reddening the blood as oxygen air. Whabare we to think of this ? B it a freak of nature, or of the author? f See Chap. Ill, delicate

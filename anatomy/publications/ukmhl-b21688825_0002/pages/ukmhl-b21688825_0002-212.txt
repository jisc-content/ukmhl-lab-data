OF RESPIRATION* 154 they are exquisitely delicate. Their respiration is like the Erog’s in this respect, that they swallow the water with their mouths; and in this it is like the fowls, that they drive it through among their gills, which lie perfectly passive like the true lungs of a fowl. A fish’s gills are ranged in semicircles under the great flap which covers them four or five semicircles on each side; the fish opens its mouth wide, fills it with water, shuts the mouth, then drives the water backwards, so that it lifts the great flap and makes its way out behind, and rushes with a sort of stream through among the red gills, raising each semicircle from another, and making the water play freely round each feathery-like process. It seems tome, that wherever this mixture of water and air is used, there must be some force to give impression to the air upon the blood. The depth to which fishes go, and the pressure of the water, must give some effect in impressing the air upon the lungs. The gill must play more or less strongly according to various depths, just as the fish must swim more strongly against a ruder stream. Some fishes, as the Trout, Perch, Salmon, Herring, have more open gills, yet they do not want this power of impressing the air more or less strongly against the gills. The Eel and the

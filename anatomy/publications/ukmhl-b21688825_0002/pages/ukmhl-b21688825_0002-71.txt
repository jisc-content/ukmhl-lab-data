OF THE HFART. 27 seen many sm11 ;bhque a: J very curious openings, which serve Hr the mouths of veins, while their obli- quity performs the oflice of a valve This name of coronary vessels i - a very favourite one with anato- mists, and is applied wherever vessels surround the parts which they belong to, however little this en- circling may be like a crown ; and it is thus that we have the coronary arteries of the stomach, coronary arteries of the lips, and coronary arteries of the heart. Sut these vessels of the heart are really very beautiful, and have some things very peculiar in their circula- tion : first, with regard to the coronary arteries, they lie with their mouths under the sigmoid valves : or at least in so equivocal a manner, that their peculiar posture has given rise to violent disputes ; viz. Whether they be filled, like all the other arteries, by the stroke of the heart, or whether they be covered by the valve so as to let the blood rush past them during the action of the heart. We see the opening of the coronary arteries rather, as I imagine, under the valve ; though Haller says they are above the valve, and that the highest point to which the margin of the valve reaches in very old men is below the opening of the coronary artery, and half way betwixt it and the bottom of the sinus or little bag behind the valve. But let this be as it will, if the condition of the aorta be considered, it will be found to make no difference ; for though the valves rise and fall, are at one time fully opened, and at another time closely shut, still in both these conditions of the valve the aorta is as full as it can hold; its contraction -instantaneously follows that of the heart, but its contraction

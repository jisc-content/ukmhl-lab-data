OF THE FOREARM. 39S of the thumb. It takes its course directly across the back of the hand, over the carpal bones 5 and by its frequent inosculations with branches from the ulnar artery* and with the interosseous arteries, it makes beautiful net-works across all the naked part of the back of the hand. After this beautiful net-work, it sends twigs forwards, which lie close upon the bones, go to the muscles which lie betwixt the bones. The muscles are named interossei, and these twigs are named after them. The first interosseous artery is large, long, goes up in a direct course to the fork betwixt the fore and mid fingers, and plunges into the cleft of the digital artery at right angles with it. The dorsalis manus gives then a second twig like this, and then a third ; named the first, second, and third interosseous arteries: but they are all smaller than the first, and all the three commu- nicate with the arteries from the palm. Before the final division of the radial artery* into its three branches, it gives a third artery, or, as often happens, two arteries, to the back of the thumb. ARTERIA DORSALIS POLLICIS. The small artery, or the two small arteries which, from going along the back of the thumb, are named arteriae dorsalis pollicis, come off either along with, or * Notwithstanding the inconsistency of retaining the name of radial artery, after the artery has passed the wrist, and begun to run along the thumb, I venture to sacrifice verbal accuracy, and would make much greater sacrifices to obtain a clear arrangement. imme-

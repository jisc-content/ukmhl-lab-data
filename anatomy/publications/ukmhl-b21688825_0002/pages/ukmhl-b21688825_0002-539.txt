OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 467 ARTERIA CIRCUMFLEXA EXTERNA. The circumflex artery, which goes to the out- side of the hip-joint, proceeds from the very highest point of the profunda. It takes its course outwards, passing under the sartorius, fascialis, and head of the rectus : it runs over the tendinous head of the vastus internus, where that muscle' takes its rise from the outer trochanter: it divides very early into the fol- lowing branches —First, Branches go to the inner side, to the internal iliac muscle, upon which this ar- tery lies; and round it they bend over the lesser tro- chanter, making inosculations with the internal circum- flex artery.—Secondly, An artery goes in the opposite direction, viz. outwards, to the iliac muscle, the sar- torius, the head of the rectus, the fascialis, and round to the glutseal muscles.—Thirdly, It sends many lesser branches upwards and forwards into the heads of those muscles which I have just enumerated, and which lie immediately over the artery.—Fourthly, It sends large branches round the root of the great trochanter, some of them going into the hollow above the trochanter; others keeping so low as the root of the trochanter, where the greater glutaeus is inserted.—Fifthly, The most important of all its branches is a very long one, which it sends directly downwards under the rectus, or betwixt it and the vastus internus muscle. This 4 artery is divided into two great branches, which run down the whole length of the thigh, somewhat re- sembling in their shape the profunda humeri : they are named the greater and lesser descending branches Hh 2 of

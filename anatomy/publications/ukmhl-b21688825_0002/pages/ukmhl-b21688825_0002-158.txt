106 OF THE BLOOD. how much expressly it .has gained or lost. Modern chemistry proves to us, that it is not the loss of any principle that endows a metal, for example, with negative powers; but the direct acquisition of a new principle, which endows it with positive powers. Thus if you take a quantity of mercury, and expose it slowly, that is, for a long time to heat and air, the following changes take place; it gradually loses its metallic lustre, the upper part of it assumes first a yel- low and then a red colour, small red particles are seen floating on the surface of the mercury; and these are the mercurius precipitatus per se, a most acrid calx of mercury. If, first, you estimate how much air has been expended during the process, you find that the weight of the mercury is increased in exact proportion; if you put that calx into a gun-barrel, put the gun-barrel into the fire, and by mere force of heat drive out this air, you find the quantity of air exactly equivalent to the quantity expended in the process; you find the metal grow lighter, and recover its metallic qualities and lustre in proportion as the air is expelled. In short, we find the metal heavier when combined with air, lighter when the air is driven out; we find it having *he qualities of a metal when unco nbined with air, when combined with air having the qualities of a calx: then plainly this caustic form of the metal is not a negative quality, it is a positive one, proceeding from the infusion of this new prin- ciple from the air. By such proofs as these chemistry has explained, in a most philosophical way, how all these phlogistic processes, as they were called, depend, not on the abstraction

309 OF THE BRAIN. of the pia mater is named velum from its beauty arid delicacy; and this is what Wepfer, among other older authors, considered as a species at least of the rete mirabile: but that name implies a peculiar office, as in beasts, which this delicate net-work of vessels can- not have. 2. ARTERIA ANTERIOR CEREBRI. The fore artery of the brain comes off from the middle artery at right angles nearly; for the great or middle artery runs directly outwards towards the temple, while this second artery runs directly for-, wards along the fore lobe of the brain. It is named sometimes the artery of the corpus callosum, because that of two great branches into which it is divided one goes to that part of the brain. The corpus cal- losum ( a most absurd name for any part of the brain ) is the white and medullary substance where the two hemispheres of the brain are joined; and upon sepa- rating the two hemispheres with the fingers, the corpus callosum is seen like a large white arch, and the artery of the corpus callosum is seen also arching over its surface. The anatomy of the arteria anterior cerebri may there- fore be explained thus: First it goes off at right an- gles from the middle artery of the brain, which is to be considered as the trunk, and there it often gives small twigs to the olfactory and optic nerves: next the two anterior arteries of each side, while they go forwards as if towards the crista galli, bend a little towards each other; they almost meet, but X 3 do

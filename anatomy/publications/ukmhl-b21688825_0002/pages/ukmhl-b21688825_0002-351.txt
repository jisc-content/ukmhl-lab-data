OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 287 directly forwards through the substance of the parotid gland, mounts before the ear; and as it passes alter- nately the parotid gland, the face, the ear, it gives its three chief branches to these parts, and ends in that temporal artery which runs along the side of the head under the skin, which we feel, and even see distinctly, beating, and which we open when bleeding in the temples is required. The temporal artery is named superficial because of its lying under the skin only, above the fascia of the temporal muscle, while the deep branches from the maxillary artery lie under the muscle.â€” The temporal artery passes just before the meatus auditorius, and behind the branch of the jaw-bone; it pushes its way through the substance of the parotid gland, and there it gives its first branches, commonly seven or eight in number, but quite irregular, into the substance of the gland itself; next it gives off to the face an artery of very considerable size; which arises from the same part of the artery with these parotideal branches, viz. under the zygoma and within the gland : like them it goes off almost at a right angle, and is like one of them, but larger, nearly of the size of a crowquill; it pushes sidewise through the substance of the parotid, emerges from it upon the face just below the cheek-bone; runs across the cheek in the same direction with the parotid duct; it is named from this direction transversalis faciei. Its branches go to the joint of the jaw-bone, the rnasseter, buccinator, parotid gland, &c. and terminate in inosculations with all the arteries of the face.

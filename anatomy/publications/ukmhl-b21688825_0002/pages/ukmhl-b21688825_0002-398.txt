ARTERIES OF THE EYE. 332 inosculates, of course, with the nasal arteries of the external carotid. 2. ARTER1A JETHMOIDALIS ANTERIOR. The anterior sethmoidal artery is rather more regular and more important; it passes through a larger hole, and is itself larger; it comes off more, regularly from the ophthalmic trunk, and it goes not down into the nose, but upwards into the skull. The ophthalmic artery, much exhausted by giving off many branches, has risen over the optic nerve, has completed its spiral turn, and has just got to the inner corner of the eye, where the sethmoid hole is, when the, anterior asthmoid artery arises from it. It arises just behind the pully oF the upper oblique muscle, plunges immediately into its peculiar hole, and, passing along a canal within the sethmoid bone, it merely gives twigs to the frontal and aethmoidal sinuses, and passes up by one of the largest holes in the cribriform plate of the aethmoid bone. When within the skull, it is under the dura mater, betwixt it and the bone ; it goes to the dura mater and to the root of the falx, and some of its delicate twigs turn downwards again into the nose, through the small holes of the cribriform plate accompanying the branches of the olfactory nerve. FIFTH ORDER. The fifth order of arteries is very numerous, in- cluding all those which send their twigs outwards upon

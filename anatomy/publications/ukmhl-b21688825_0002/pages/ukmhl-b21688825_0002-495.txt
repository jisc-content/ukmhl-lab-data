OF THE INTESTINES. 425 with the caput coli or beginning of the great in- testine. COLICA MEDIA. 1. The middle colic artery passes along in the doubling, i.-e, betwixt the two lamellae of the meso- colon. It goes with a circular sweep upwards to- wards that part or corner as we may call it) of the colon which lurks under the liver; but before it touches the intestine, and generally at the distance of about three or four inches from it, this artery divides into two great branches; one turning backwards, along the right side of the colon, inosculates with the colic arteries; the other, more like the continued trunk, tarns upwards, bending according to the curvature of the arch of the colon, which supports the stomach; and having rounded the concave of this arch, and arrived at the left side, it there makes a great inosculation with the left colic artery, which is a chief branch of the lower mesenteric; and so completes the great mesenteric arch, one of the most celebiated inoscu- lations in the whole body, that of the circle of Willis hardly excepted. COLICA DEXTR4. 2. The right colic artery in enumerated as & distinct artery, chiefly for the sake of plainness ; for though sometimes it arises apart from the general mesenteric trunk, yet in ninety-nine of one hun- dred bodies it proceeds from the upper or middle colic artery. It is a very large branch; it is set off from the colica media at a very acute angle; it moves

458 OP THE ARTERIES such amputations to find the great artery close by the bone. As the artery is at this point tied down by the tendon of the triceps, and is in fact passing through a tendinous ring, it sometimes happens that when we have cut near this, but not upon it, the flesh shrinks in such a way that even this great artery, though it bleeds, is not easily found; but one stroke of the scal- pel, running along the bone, cuts the tendon up, and exposes the artery with open mouth.——This single point makes all the difference betwixt an aneurism of the thigh and of the ham ; it is peculiarly necessary to mark this, in order to ascertain the extent of the disease before beginning an operation. Nothing can have a worse appearance than that which has actually happened, viz. a surgeon beginning that operation in the ham, which he should have attempted rather on the forepart of the thigh; and being forced to change his ground, and to begin a second operation on the forepart of the thigh, or, what is worse, to cut up the tendon, and follow the diseased artery to the fore- part of the thigh, cutting, in short, first longitudinally betwixt the hamstrings, and, after an hour’s working perhaps, cutting crosswise to reach the forepart of the thigh. 6thlv, Is it not a matter of very high importance to study the ham still more carefully than the axilla, since the artery is so often hurt at this place by rude mo- tions of the joint ? For it is a narrow cavity ; the ar- tery lies close upon the joint and bones ; and when it is allowed to remain long in a diseased state, enlarg- ing and dilating the ham, we perform in the end a hopeless operation; or, if we had hopes, when we be- gan

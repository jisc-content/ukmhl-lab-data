THE HEART. 207 mouth is sometimes so beset with a sort of fleshy granulous papillae, that there is hardly left opening enough to pass a silver probe. The degree of con- traction in the pulmonic artery is the true measure of all the oxydated blood which that system can receive ; but in such a system the quantity is still farther reduced by various accidents of the organization. Thus, for example,—The pulmonic artery is, we shall suppose, but one third of its natural size, and the original quantity of oxydated blood is proportionably small;— next, the foramen ovale, being open, carries off much blood towards the left auricle; the aorta, planted over the right ventricle, carries off also much blood.—• But let us suppose, that still as much remains as to fill the pulmonic artery to its full; when the pure blood comes round to the left side it is mixed through the foramen ovale, and through the breach of the septum, with a quantity of black blood, which is continually accumulating upon it; and the small quantity of oxy- dated blood is, if I may use the expression, drowned in the general mass. That I may explain the point of its accumulating a little farther, let me repeat, that even in a child which has died on the tenth day of such a disorder, the heart is crammed with dark-coloured blood : That in those children which have lived two or three years under such a distress, the heart has been greatly enlarged: That in a boy dissected by Sandifort, who died at fifteen, the thing that was first seen upon open- ing the body was, not the lungs covering the heart and lapping over it, but a large mass, lying betwixt the lungs, oppressing them; and pushing them aside m

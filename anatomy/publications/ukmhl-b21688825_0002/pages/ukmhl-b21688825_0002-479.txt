411 OF THE ABDOMEN, properly but three branches, has a fourth added* which is the phrenic artery; sometimes there are three phrenic arteries, sometimes even four; and the diaphragm, it is always to be remembered, receives often smaller branches from the intercostal and lumbar arteries, or from the capsular arteries, besides those which it gets from the thorax along with its nerve coming along the pericardium. These varieties being" mentioned, the history of the regular phrenic arteries may be very short. One gees round the right side of the diaphragm, and the other round the left, with very little variety. First the phrenic artery crosses what is called the fleshy part of the crus diaphragmatis of its own side, and goes bend- ing along to what is called the ala or wing of the dia- phragm, and gives a great many arteries in all direc- tions into these fleshy sides of the diaphragm; the artery then turns round, and encircles the great cen- tral tendon, where the two phrenic arteries begin to turn round: they give one branch particularly large to the fleshy sides of the diaphragm, which arise from the ribs ; then bending round the central tendon, they spread all their remaining branches forwards Upon the central tendon, and upon that part of the muscle which arises from the sternum, and meet in large inoscula- tions with each other. One branch often pierces the diaphragm, goes into the pericardium where it is at- tached to the diaphragm, and unites with that artery which comes down along with the phrenic nerve, the comes nervi phrenici. But still it is to be remembered, that the phrenic arteries, before they enter into the diaphragm, give small

OF THE MECHtANISM 14 by this plan the names of sinus and auricle must be easily understood. The point chiefly to be noted is this, that the veins, as they approach* the auricle, are thin, delicate, transparent; that where they expand into the sinus they become fleshy, thick, and strong ; that in the auricle itself the muscular fibres at (f) are very strong, have deep sulci like those of the ventricle, cross each other so as to make a net-work ; and these strong fibres (f) are what are named the musculi pec- tinati auriculae. Where these muscles run, as in cords, across the auricle they are very thick and opaque; but in the interstice of each stripe of muscular fibre, the auricle is perfectly and beautifully transparent, like the membranes of the veins; and these stripes of muscu- lar fibre which are laid upon this thin membrane are almost as regular as the teeth of a comb; and thus they are named musculi pectinati. 5. The valves of the auricle are placed at the cir- cle (/'), where the auricle enters into the ventricle, and the valves are marked \Ji): and how necessary these are for regulating the movements of the heart, will be easily understood by considering the conditions in which the auricle and ventricle act. First, The cavas pour in a flood of blood upon the sinus and auricle, with a continual pressure; the moment the auricle has contracted, it is full again ; the pressure from be- hind excites it to act, and while it is acting there is no occasion for valves to guard those veins whose blood is pressing forwards continually, because they are continually full, and have behind them the whole pressure of the circulating blood. But when the au- ricle acts, it throws its blood into the ventricle, fills it, and

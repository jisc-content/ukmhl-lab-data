355 OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY A a 2 The thoracic ganglion of the great intercostal nerve lies. Before it takes its place betwixt the ribs as the inter- costal of the two upper spaces,it sendsa branch upwards upon the face of the lower vertebrae of the neck, which is given to the scaleni, to the longus colli muscle, and to the nerves; next it gives off the highest intercostal artery for the space betwixt the first and second ribs, which artery divides into two branches ; one perforates the thorax, and goes out upon the back, and supplies the muscles which lie flat upon the back of the chest; while .another branch, the proper intercostal branch, runs along betwixt the ribs. Next it gives eff a second intercostal artery, which also has its external and internal branches, and of which a branch inosculates over the third rib with the uppermost intercostal of the aorta. Besides these, it gives also small branches to the oesophagus, which inosculate with the tracheal arteries; and it gives branches to the spinal marrow, which pass into the canal along the holes for the nerves; and which not only supply the sheath, but also inosculate with the arteries of the spinal marrow itself. 7. ARTERIA SUPRA-SCAPULARIS. The supra-scapular artery, or the superior sca- pular artery, is one of such magnitude, is so different in size and destination from the cervical and other small arteries of the neck, that it ought to be described apart; though of great size and importance, it is yet so little known, that Sabbatier does not even describe nor name it.

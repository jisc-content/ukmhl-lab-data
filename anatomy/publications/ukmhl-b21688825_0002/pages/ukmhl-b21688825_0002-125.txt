OF THE BLOOD. 73 pose is the thymus appointed ; viz. to assist the lym- phatic glands in organizing blood. This gland lies in the upper part of the chest, is great in the child, has vanished in the adult, but while it exists, he finds it full of a milky juice or whitish mucus, fit to make central particles for the blood ; and the lymphatics, as he supposes, are the excretories for this gland. He next conjectures, that this work, begun thus by the lymphatic glands, and thymus; is perfected by the spleen; that the lymphatics make central particles only, while the vesicular coverings are formed in the spleen ; so that there only do the particles become per- fect; and accordingly of these parts it is in the spleen alone that the red blood is found. As the central particles are formed in the cells of the lymphatic glands, the vesicular parts are formed in the cells of the spleen, and the lymphatics unload these cells of the particles when completely formed: but there appears no other proof that they do this office than that there are cells in the spleen which may make vesicles; and that the lymphatics being tied, and the spleen squeezed, red globules are sometimes found in them. Long poring over a wearisome subject, and an intense desire to finish that account of the blood which he had so successfully begun, are strong apologies for all these mistakes. No man will venture to deny, that the glands and lymphatic vessels probably accomplish some im- portant changes upon all fluids which pass through them; but that they alone organize the blood is not to be conceived. Their containing round white par- ticles, argues nothing; these exist in the chyle, and probably

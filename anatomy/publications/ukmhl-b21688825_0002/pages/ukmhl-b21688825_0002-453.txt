OF THE FOREARM- . 385 in the palm of the hand, and all the arteries of the fingers, saving only the inner side of the fore finger, * .The radial artery goes off like a branch from the ul- nar, or, in other words, the ulnar seems to continue in the course of the main artery, while the radial goes off to one side ; it makes its appearance as a su- perficial artery much higher in the forearm than the ulnar does; its chief branch turns backwards over the wrist, or root of the thumb, and it gives all the arteries of the thumb and forefinger, as the ulnar does of the other fingers. The interosseous, again,is truly a branch, from the ulnar ; it comes off where the ulnar lies deepest; it runs along the interosseous membrane, whence its name; it belongs to the deep muscles of the arm ; it scarcely passes the wrist, or at least mounts but a very little way along the back of the hand. These are the greatest divisions of the artery; but before entering upon these, it will be well to set apart and describe one particular set of arteries, viz. the recurrents; both because they belong in a peculiar manner to the joint, and because the recurrents, from whichsoever of the great arteries they come, still serve the same office, viz. of inosculating with these from the above joint; though, after all, this part of their office attracts our attention,, chiefly because we depend upon these inosculations for our success ip operations for aneurism, though unquestionably the â–  chief use of these arteries is to supply the joint and adjacent parts; and their inosculations are but a secondary office.

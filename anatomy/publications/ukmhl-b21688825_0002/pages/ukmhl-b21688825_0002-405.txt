339 ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. pia mater enter are by the anterior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles ; at which points, and indeed at all the lower parts of the brain, the ventri- cles must be considered as shut, since these vascular linings, as they enter, adhere on all sides: but may also be considered as open, since they admit these membranes, since they are shut only by their slight adhesion, and may be opened by pulling the parts gently asunder. This, then, is a general explanation of that vascular part of the pia mater which covers all the basis, and lines all the cavities, of the brain. It is one continuous membrane, under the various titles of rete mirabile, which some older anatomists use; of velum, a name chiefly repeated by Haller; and of plexus choroides, a name universally used for that net-work of vessels, which lies out upon the floors of the ventricles. It will be seen hereafter how greatly a knowledge of these inflections contributes to the right understanding of the brain and its parts and cavities. Z 2 CHAE

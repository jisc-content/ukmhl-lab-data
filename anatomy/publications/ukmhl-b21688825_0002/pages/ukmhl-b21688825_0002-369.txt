OF THE BRAIN. 303 tions cannot be important, which are hardly known, which do not go in any two subjects the same way. OF THE INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The internal carotid artery leaves the external carotid at the angle of the jaw: it is so inclined to contortions, that at this point it even bulges, and seems the outermost of the two. In mounting along the neck, it is tied by cellular substance to the fore part of the rectus or straight muscle of the neck, and it is also connected with the par vagum and intercostal nerve ; the ganglion of the intercostal, or sympathetic nerve, lies by its side; the nerve, before it forms this ganglion, comes down small and thread like through the same canal'by which the carotid passes into tne skull. The contortions of the carotid are great, both before and after its passage through the bony canal; but within the canal it is forced to particular and success, sive bendings, such as indicate plainly some design of Nature ; for the canal for the artery is long and tortu- ous, while the nerves and veins pass through plain and simple holes. When the carotid first presents itself to enter the skull, it is curved, and is a little behind its hole â€¢, it bends forwards and inwrards a little, and so enters the canal; in entering the canal it rises almost perpendicularly upwards, but soon bends forwards again, lying, as it were, upon the floor of the canal; then it bends again upwards and forwards, to emerge from the canal; by which turn the portion of the artery

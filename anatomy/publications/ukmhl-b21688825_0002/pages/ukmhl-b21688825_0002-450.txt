OF THE ARTERIES 38S dial and ulnar are set of in the axilla.‚Äù This surely must have been but a cold assurance to the surgeon in those days, viz. that he was to trust chiefly to the chance of a lusus naturae for the success of one of his greatest operations. Thirdly, It must follow, since the artery lies behind the fascia, and is wounded through it, that the blood being poured out behind the fascia, must raise it into a hard, firm, and (in time) inelastic tumour, growing every day firmer and harder. If surgeons will but think of this, they will go through their operation more correctly. It makes a point of vast importance in the description of aneurism, since it gives outwardly the true character, and inwardly the true shape and appearance of the tumour, when the operation is begun, the outward incision being performed. Had it been but attended to rightly, what noise and wrangling might it not have saved about the nature and names of the disease (yet still the older surgeons knew and described this piece of anatomy, though they made but a poor use of it) ? and what idle and stupid descriptions might it not have prevented, such as we have never seen ih surgical books till now, of diffused aneurism, and the opera- tion for diffused aneurism ; when in truth the first stroke of the knife shows it to be a tumour very dif- ferent from that which such names, and such formal divisions, and old fashioned descriptions must convey ? The cup of an aneurism is the triangular hollow which I have described, and the bag of the tumour is the extended fascia. Fourthly,

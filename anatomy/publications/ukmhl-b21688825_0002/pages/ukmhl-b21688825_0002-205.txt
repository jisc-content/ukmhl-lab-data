OF RESPIRATION, 149 Frog; it has, like the Frog, a constant motion by short strokes of the bag under the jaw (which oag is formed by the membranes of the mouth, covered and moved by the genio-hyoidei and mylo-hyoidei mus- cles); but w e observe that every minute, or less, it stops as if intending some particular motion; then gradually the bag swells out under the lower jaw to a great size; then the air contained in it is puffed down into the lungs with a sudden hap of the bag; and in proportion as the jaws are emptied the long sides of the creature are heaved up. The Toad, the Chamelion, the Gre'en Lizard, breathe exactly in the same way. The Chamelion has the flat broad jaws of the Frog; they lock into each other, and it never opens its mouth; it swallows its air in mouthfuls, drives it downwards into its lungs; its lungs are of a vast extent, stretching from the jaw9 all along the abdomen: it is the vast size of its lungs, almost concealing the abdominal viscera, that makes Gesner say, “ that of the entrails of a Chame- lion the lungs only are visible.” The air it swal- lows in greater or smaller quantity as its needs or fears prompt it. When you alarm this timorous ani. mal, it fills its sides just as a Frog swells out its back ; and either in this greater respiration, or in its ordi- nary breathing, we see it pressing the air onwards from cell to cell; and we see the motion proceeding from its jaws to its breast, and all along its sides, till its lank form is quite puffed up almost to bursting. All these creatures have, in addition to their pecu. liar respiration, a peculiar kind of lungs, thin, mem- branous, and extremely delicate: the lungs even of L 3

OF,THE BLOOD* 99 from the serum, containing gluten enough to support the tenuity of the blood, salt enough to keep the red globules in their form, and conveying also a sufficiency of lymph into the most delicate and bloodless parts of the body : and this above all is a most singular pro- perty of the serum, that it admits freely the air to pass through and impregnate the blood ; for when the coa_ gulum of the blood is drowned deep in its serum, if turned up and exposed to air it reddens ; which, if oil, mucilage, water, or any other fluid, be substituted in- stead of serum, it will not do. Next, we see the red globules of large diameter, but in quantity very small, i. e. in proportion to the whole system ; of large diameters, that they may not go into the very minute vessels, and in small quantities, because they are accumulated round the heart, and in the greater vessels, And, lastly, the gluten is the most important part of the blood ; that which, being dissolved in the serum, pervades even the most exquisite vessels of the system; the part from which all our solids are formed, and into which all our solids, and even fluids, can be resolved. But allowing for the various*proportions of the w'ater which dilutes the serum and the red globules (whose proportion to the fluids cannot be narhed it is so small), and some saccharine or extractive matter which is in the serum of the bloodâ€”what is there except gluten in all the animal system ? Serum, coagulum, flesh, tendons, ligaments, bones, all are composed of it; and when gluten is thus united to the solids, forming with them one individual body, it acquires new powers, and is indeed alive.

When a child comes with its feet or other parts of the body first, the head being last delivered, is diffi- culty delivered; the accoucher struggles Jong in bri nging out the head ; the umbilical cord is com- pressed all die while, and the child dies. The ductus arteriosus, nor the oval hole, cannot save the child, for it dies because it is deprived of the function of the placenta, which is the foetal lungs; and this is the cause why it appears like one suffocated or drowned.

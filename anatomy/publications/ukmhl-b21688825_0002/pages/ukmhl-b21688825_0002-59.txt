OF THE HEART. 11 for this auricle and ventricle of the right side have the weight of the whole blood of the body pressing upon them. They are subject to occasional fulness, for they must be dilated by many accidents, as labour, violent struggles, &c. vvhich send the blood too quickly upon the heart; while the left auricle and ventricle, on the other hand, can never be overloaded, as long as the pulmonic artery preserves its natural size, for that artery continues always the measure of the quantity of blood which they receive. The ventricle is thick, strong, and fleshy. Its inner sw/ice is extremely irre- gular; it puts out from every part of its surface very strong fleshy columns. These fleshy columns are irre- gular in size, big,strong, running along the length of the ventricle ; some cross the ventricle, so as to connect its opposite walls together; some have the tendons of the valves fixed to them; all of them have perfect con- tractile power, and are indeed the strongest muscles of the heart. Betwixt the fleshy columns, there are, of course, very deep and irregular grooves; and among the confused roots of these fleshy columns the blood often coagulates after death, seldom before it, into the form of what are called polipi of tire heart. Yet still the walls of the right ventricle (//)â€”are thinner, the fleshy columns smaller, the cavity greater, than those of the left side; the right ventricle of the heart has also a peculiar form, for the septum coanis, a partition betwixt the right and left hear1, is not, as generally supposed, a part common to both; but the left ventricle is much longer, and more conical than the right one ; the septum belongs almost entirely to the left ventricle $ the right ventricle, which is much big* Vol, II.

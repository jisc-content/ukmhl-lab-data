OP the arteries 452 The the outer edge, or that which is next to the hip-joint, so that they meet upon the bone inosculating with each other. CHAP. IV. ARTERIES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY'. ILIACA EXTERNA. The external iliac artery is that branch of the common iliac which descends under Poupartâ€™s liga- ment into the thigh. The internal iliac or artery of the pelvis parts from this within the pelvis at the join- ing of the ilium and sacrum. The external iliac passes down into the thigh, by bending along the upper edge or brim of the pelvis, directed by the lower edge of the psoas muscle, which also descends into the thigh. This great artery is accompanied by the anterior cru- ral nerve; its corresponding vein lies by the side of it; the lymphatics of the thigh creep upwards along this artery into the pelvis; and when the artery de- scends into the thigh, it passes so over the bulging part of the acetabulum and head of the thigh-bone, that it is felt projecting there and beating with ama- zing force.

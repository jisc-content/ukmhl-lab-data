16 OF THE MECHANISM is plainly the place of union betwixt the auricle and ventricle, which are in the foetus (in the chick, for example) distinct bags j and from all the circle of this hole arises a membrane, thin, and apparently de- licate, but really very strong ; not divided into parti- cular valves at this root or basis, but as the membrane hangs down into the ventricle, it grows thinner, and is divided into fringes. How these fringes can do the office of valves is next to be explained. The tags and fringes of this membrane are actually tied to the inside of the ventricle by many strings, which being, like the valves, of a tendinous nature, are called cord^e tendineai, or tendinous cords ; and these cords being attached to little processes projecting from the mus- cular substance of the heart, these processes are named columns carne^e, or fleshy columns. Of these tyings of the valves there are three chief points ; the whole circle seems to be divided into three sharp pointed valves ; they are named valvule tricus- pides, or three-pointed, or. they are still sometimes called Triglochine Valves. These strings and muscles cross each other; the valve at the left part of the circle is tied obliquely to the right side of the ventricle, and so on ; so that by this crossing of their tendons the valves fall down easily when the blood goes down through them, and they rise readily and quickly whenever the blood gets behind them. The columns carnese tie down the valves, so that when the ventricle acts the most strongly, they are the most strongly retained. 6. The ventricle of the right side (//) is like its auricle, larger than the same parts on the left side j for

266 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. About the middle of the tongue, or about half way to the chin, measuring along the jaw, the lingual artery forks into two branches ; the one below the tongue, the sublingualis, belongs to the sublingual gland and surrounding parts ; the other remaining at the root of the tongue, belongs to the tongue itself. 3. Sublingualis then arises next; it comes from the side of the artery next the tongue ; it runs under the sublingual gland, covered like it by the genio- hyoideus muscle, and emerges only when it arrives at the chin, where it terminates in the skin. Its branches are chiefly to the sublingual gland, which lies over it, and to the genio-hyoidei and mylo-hyoidei muscles and skin, for these are the parts which immediately cover it. . 4. The arteria ranina is the larger branch of these two ; it runs along the root of the tongue quite to the tip of it. In this course it is accompanied by its vein, which appears on the inside of the mouth when we turn up the tip of the tongue. This is the vein which the older physicians were so fond of having opened in sore throats; the artery is that which we are so apt to cut in dividing the frenulum linguae; an awkwardness from which a great many children have died. N. B. It runs along the genio-glassus, which is the innermost muscle of the tongue. 3. arteria labialis. The labial artery is named'occasionally the ex- â€™I'e^.nal maxillary artery, to distinguish it from one whieh

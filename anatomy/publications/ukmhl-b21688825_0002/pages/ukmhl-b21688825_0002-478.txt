OF THE ARTERIES 410 coeliac and mesenteric plexus arise chiefly from that solar one. The aorta, thus connected, having come out into the abdomen, the first branch which it gives off na- turally is a small one to the diaphragm as it passes un- der it. The next branch which it gives oft is the most important of all, viz. the coeliac artery; and it supplies the stomach, the liver, and the spleen, because they lie in the upper part of the abdomen. Next it gives a great artery to the intestines, which is named the superior mesenteric artery; for it goes to the in- testines which lie within the abdomen. And, lastly, it gives off a great artery, which is named lower me- senteric ; because it supplies chiefly the lower part of the great intestines, and most especially the rectum, where it goes down into the pelvis. Then the aorta divides into the two iliac arteries, and of course has no longer the name of abdominal aorta. ARTERI® PHRENIC.®. The diaphragm has in nine of ten bodies two arteries named the phrenic arteries ; one going to the right side, the other to the left. The varieties of this artery are too great almost to be mentioned; but, however, these are the chief: Generally the phrenic arteries are two small arteries arising from the aorta, one going to the right side, another to the left; often there is one artery going off from the forepart of the aorta, and dividing immediately into twoarteries, right andleft; sometimes one arises from the aorta itself, another from the coe- liac artery; sometimes the coeliac artery, which has properly

'227 THE HEART. to a large heart. But a perfect proof is this: I have a heart which it would not be easy to describe; it is not only as big as two hearts joined, but I may say, with Bartholine, 44 ut saepe in Bobus non magis sit aut ponderosior.” The heart is bigger actually than an ox’s; it is bigger, I ihink, by the whole size of its two great auricles; it is injected with wax; it weighs more than four pounds, and is two feet in circumference; but the aorta is no bigger than the femoral artery at the groin, very straight and even in its diameter, very slender, and with coats which plainly have been very thin and suitable to such an artery. Here the artery is equably and fairly contracted to one fourth of its natural size, which supposes a natural and sound condition of its coats: And one of two things must have happened, either (he artery must have contracted first, opposing the heart and causing it to enlarge; but then its violent contrac- tion, like the urethra contracting in opposition to the bladder, would have thickened it into a strong mus- cular tube: or, secondly, the artery must have con- tracted gently and gradually in favour of the dilata- tion and weakness of the heart; and then it would remain (as this artery really was) very soft, delicate, and limber; in short quite natural. 1 suspect also that where the aorta is enlarged, there is required a strong, small, and muscular heart; because I have an aorta enlarged to a very great degree the heart being extremely small. These accidents will be noticed chiefly where, in young people, there happens such disproportion of muscular power betwixt the heart and its vessels; but in the aged, all the parts are but Q 2 too

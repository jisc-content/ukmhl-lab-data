47 OF THE HEART. limb or part of the body; it is the place of the lungs that regulates the posture of the heart; and wherever they are, it is. Except the Oyster, I hardly know of any creature in which the heart lies expressly in the centre of the body. In Frogs, Toads, Newts, and Snakes, the lungs are not moved by any diaphragm; they are filled only by the working of the jaws, the lungs then begin under the jaws, and the heart is lodged at the root of the jaws, leaving, as in a Newt or Cameleon, Crocodile, Adder, Serpent, &c. the whole length of their trailing body behind. In a fish, the gills serve the creature for lungs ; the gills are lodged under the jaws, and the heart is placed betwixt them. In insects, as in the common Caterpillar (the autelia of our common Butterfly), the air enters by many pores on its sides ; and accordingly its heart is not a small round bag, but may be easily seen runrnng all down its back, working like a long aorta, but having regular pulsations, denoting it to be the heart; and this you easily see through the insect’s skin, for it is more trans- parent along the back where the heart is. The breast in man is divided into two cavities by a membrane named the mediastinum. This membrane passes directly across the breast from the sternum • before, till it fixes itself into the spine behind. It is on the left side of this membrane, in the left cavity cf the breast, that the heart is placed, lying out flat upon the diaphragm as upon a floor, by which it is sup- ported * ; and that surface (a)—which lies thus upon the * The true position of the heart is what is represented in 16. and 17 ; where N° 16. shows the heart set upright, as I have hitherto

164 OF RESPIRATION. a Fly, and lias its puncta very freely exposed to the air: in the Rhinoceros Beetle the Worm has more puncta respiratoria, and closer, because it crawls on the ground amidst mud or dust; they are less nu- merous in the Fly, as its air-holes are always more freely exposed ; and when the Beetle is actually fly- ing, those puncta which were closed by the cases of the wings are fully opened ; so that the insect breathes more freely, and perhaps its body is lightened, so that it flies more easily: it is also particular, that in the full grown Beetle, though the puncta be less in num" ber, the lungs are enlarged, they both change their form and become more capacious; for the tubes are mere tracheas or straight lines, v\ ith direct branches in the Worm, but in the Beetle they are dilated from point to point into air-bags. Insects in general are bred in eggs, transformed into Worms, assume then the form of an aurelia, that is, of a Fly, small but full formed, with its legs drawn up, its wings plaited and folded, ready at all points to burst from the covering which surrounds it; for both in posture and in the membranes which sur- round it, it resembles a foetus. In these three stages it still is nourished by air-tubes: they open by puncta respirato ia while it remains a Worm; the same punc- ta stiil serve it while it is wrapped up an aurelia or concealed Fly ; when the Fly bursts out, the same puncta, the same tubes, which have served in its for- mer stages, serve it still; only this is most cuiious, that when from a Worm it proceeds a Fly, the skin which it rids itself of (crawling out of it and pushing with its feet) carries off along with it many of the internal

OF THE BLOOD. 82 juices, whether alive or not alive, were necessary to the process. Any man who affirms that in surgical operations it is the blood, tc that by a contiguous sympathy unites the parts,” should have supported his assertion by this farther argument, that without blood they will not unite. Prove to me only that fresh cut parts are not alive, and cannot naturally unite without the assistance of some foreign power, and then I will acknowledge willingly that they are altogether beholden to the in- termediation of the blood, with its living principle, and sympathy of contiguity. But it is very singular, that any person, even the least instructed in forms of reasoning, should have advanced this as any proof of living principle in the blood, ct that mortification immediately follows where the circulation is cut off;” for this proves merely, that the blood is one of many stimuli, by which the system is supported, in so much, that each limb is affected just as the whole body would be; and whether you stop the blood, which is one stimulus, or take away its heat, which is the stimulus next in power to the blood, the limb will equally die.

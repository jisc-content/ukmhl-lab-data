) OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 35 1 % 2. The ascending thyroid artery, or thyroidea ascendens, is a small and delicate branch, which lies pretty deep, going off rather from the back part of the artery ; it supplies all the deep parts of the neck, and even penetrates the vertebrae; it soon divides into an irregular number of bran hes; the artery keeps almost close to the naked vertebrae lying under most of the muscles ; its general tendency is upwards, surrounding the neck in a spiral form. Its chief twigs are, first, some which go towards the surface, i. e. to the muscles which lie over the artery, as to the scalenus, the mastoid muscle, the levator scapulae, and the splenius; and twigs of this artery play over the rectus capitis and the anterior surface of the vertebrae, and attach themselves to the eighth pair of nerves, and to the ganglion of the sympathetic nerve. Its deeper arteries again go to the intertransversarii and other muscles which lie closer upon the neck ; and these are the branches which pass in through the intervertebral holes, and penetrating the sheath of the spinal mar- row, and following its nerves, inosculate with the spinal arteries. 3. The transverse artery of the neck, or trans- versalis colli is an artery of the same kind with the last, viz. chiefly destined for the muscles, but more superficial. It passes obliquely round the neck out- wards and upwards, goes under the trapezius muscle, and covered by it sends branches as far as the occiput. Its twigs are distributed thus: First to the mastoid muscle and to the skin ; next to the trapezius, levator scapulae, and splenius; then a long branch passing obliquely upwards over the splenius, and under cover of

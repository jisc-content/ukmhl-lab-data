IS OF THE HEART. that after it is brought from market, if you lay open the breast, and stimulate the heart with any sharp point, it will renew its contractions, and in some degree the circulation. 3. The tuberculum loweri should be looked for in this point, if it were not really an imagination merely of that celebrated anatomist. The whole mat- ter is this; the two veins meet, not directly, but at a considerable angle within the vein, as at (g). Lower conceived a projection of the inner coats of the vein at this point much more considerable than what I have here represented. It was thought to do the of- fice of a valve, to break the force of the descending blood, to defend from pressure that blood which is ascending from the lower cava, and to direct the blood of the upper cava into the right auricle of the heart. But there is no such thing; although anatomists were at one time so fond of this trivial observation, that not one of them would demonstrate the heart, without de- monstrating the tuberculum Loweri; whereas, if the blood of the lower cava needs any screen above it to defend it from the pressure, it is (as I shall show pre- sently) quite of another kind; and in the place ap- pointed for finding this tuberculum Loweri we can find nothing but on the inside the natural angle of the two veins, and on the outside some fat cushioned up in. that angle in the line (A)- 4. The auricle is, as I have said, a small appen- dix to the great bag or sinus, and is marked (/). It is small, semicircular, notched or scolloped, and some- what iike a dogâ€™s ear; whence its name. In ge- neral, we name the whole of this bag auricle; but by

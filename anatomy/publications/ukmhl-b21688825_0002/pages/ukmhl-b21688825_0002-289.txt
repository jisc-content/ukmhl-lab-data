THE HEART, 225 advanced, and after many years of slow increase; yet the heart being continually loaded, and often strug- gling, cannot free itself at one stroke of all its blood; then, stroke succeeding stroke in a confused irregular way, there is a weak, irregular, intermitting, flutter- ing pulse.—Fifthly, But Nature, wonderful in her ways, sometimes finds relief from this in the regular constitution of these parts ; for while the heart dilates, and becomes more powerless as it dilates, the aorta (being but poorly filled) contracts in proportion as the heart dilates, and accommodates itself to the small quantity of blood which such a heart can give out; and thence the wonder sometimes expressed at finding an aorta extremely slender joined often to an enormous heart. “ In opening the body of a shoemaker, says Mor- gagni, whose heart was wonderfully enlarged,seeming as if you had joined two hearts, what chiefly struck us was the smallness of the aorta, more suitable to a deli- cate woman than to a man of good stature as this was. The aorta, from its passing under the diaphragm to its great division in the pelvis, was very small. This Mor- gagni first of all believed was owing to some stricture at the diaphragm; for the aorta did not pass as usual under the legs of the diaphragm, it passed through a peculiar hole; but he found this tendinous hole quite large and free. Still he believed that all the disorder of the heart arose from the contraction of the aorta, and that again from the crooked posture in which those sit who are of this trade. But that often the artery is contracted in favour of the enlarged ventricle, I am able to prove better than by this case of Mor- Vok. II, Q gagnis$.

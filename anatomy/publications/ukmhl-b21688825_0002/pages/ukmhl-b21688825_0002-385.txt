319 OF THE SPINAL MARROW. Iiad been looked upon, till the time of Veussens, as a nerve accompanying the spinal marrow, because, when empty of blood and uninjected, it is white, and not unlike a nerve. This spinal artery begins within the skull by two branches, which unite as they proceed down the spine. These two branches arise one from each vertebral artery, at the very point where the ver- tebrals are about to unite to form the basilar trunk: each artery passes down its own side of the spinal marrow, betwixt the corpora olivaria and the corpora pyramidalia; each artery, before it leaves the skull gives twigs to the tuber annulare, and to the pyrami- dal and oval bodies, for they are the beginnings of the spinal marrow; and soon after emerging from the skull *, the two spinal arteries join so as to form one anterior spinal artery. This joining is usually at the top of the neck, or rather within the skull, but some- times so low as the last vertebra of the back. Almost always they join within the head or near it; and the anterior spinal artery which they form descends along the spinal marrow in a furrow which it forms for itself. The peculiar office of this artery is to supply the spi- nal marrow and its shearh, which it does by send- ing continual branches into the substance of the spinal marrow'; while other branches go into the sheath it- self, and pass out from the spinal canal along with those nerves which go out from the spinal marrow, ac- '* The artery which accompanies the ninth pair or lingual nerve, often comes from the anterior spinal artery. companied

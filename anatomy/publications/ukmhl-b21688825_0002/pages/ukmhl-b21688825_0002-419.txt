353 OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. scaleni muscles. Its branches are few in number, it gives branches to all the scaleni muscles; others also which play over the anterior surface of the ver- tebiae and the deep muscles of the neck, as the spi- nalis colli, intertransversarii, the root of the splenius and traohelo-mastoideus ; the complexus also receives a branch which usually inosculates with the occipital artery. 5. arteria cervicalis superficialis. The superficial cervical artery is still less regular, being very often supplied by the thyroid. Its course is directly the reverse of the last, running rather outwards and downwards, or in other words, belonging rather to the shoulder than to the neck. The subclavian artery has got from under the muscles, and has passed the splenii a little way before it gives off this superficial cervical. This artery immediately attaches itself to the plexus of the brachial nerve, and is indeed hidden in the plexus: its first branch is given to the plexus, but its next and chief branch goes across to the top of the shoulder; itsends branches to the levator scapulae, trapezius, and even to the skin; while a deeper branch goes to the splenius and complexus, where these muscles arise in the neck; and when this artery is large, it sends branches along the margin of the scapula, which go even to the serratus major, rhomboides, latissimus dorsi, &c. After enumerating these jarring names, I perceive the necessity of arranging- once more those arteries ^7Â°l> -1* A a which

The coldness, the liver, the languor, the fainting, the struggles for free breathing, are all marks of ill oxy dated blood. The convulsive paroxysm is a sure consequence of the want of stimulus and force, and of blood accumulating at the right side of the heart. If, then, the child fall down in this paroxysm, it is the very surest proof that ordinary respiration will not save him from the struggle ; if during the fit he breathe so that he recovers, and that presently his strength, colour, spirits, every thing, is in a degree restored; then is it plain that the respiration during the fit, imperfect as it appears to us, is really more ef- fectual than ordinary respiration. When we observe which is the most natural way of obtaining relief, and notice the very peculiar man- ner in which these children breathe, we shall under- stand why they are breathing best when we believe they are hardly getting breath, and how they are re- covering slowly when we think them labouring in the greatest danger.

367 OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 1. ARTERIA CIRCUMFLEXA ANTERIOR. The ANTERIOR CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY, which goes round the fore part of the joint, bears no kind of pro- portion to that great artery which passes round the back. The anterior goes off from the same point nearly with the posterior, or sometimes arises from the posterior itself; it takes a direction exactly opposite ; it keeps close to the shoulder-bone, passes under the heads of the coraco-brachialis and biceps ; encircles the head of the os humeri just at the root of the cap- sular ligament, and goes round till it meets and inos- culates with the posterior circumflex artery. I never could find those muscular branches which are said to go to the scapula, or have found them very trivial; the whole artery belongs to the bone and its parts; it encircles the root of the scapsule with a sort of coronary artery; it gives twigs to the capsule, the peri- osteum and the tendons, which are implanted into the head of the bone; and having given twigs to the heads of the biceps and coraco-brachialis, it gives off its only remarkable branch, which is indeed regular and curious; it is a small branch which runs down along the bone in the groove in which the tendon of the biceps lies. Concerning the axillary artery in general, there is more to be observed than this occasion will allow. But

471 or THE FEMORAL ARTERY. downwards along the flexor muscles. First, The ar- tery which goes upwards turns over the glutasus, spreads innumerable branches about the great tro- chanter ; and meeting with the trochanteric branches of the arteriae reflexa:, make a most beautiful inoscu- lation, or rather net-work of inosculations, over the trochanter. Another transverse branch of this upper artery turns quite round the lower part of the tro- chanter, and round the thigh; among the flesh of the vastus interims; and a third branch of the same ar- tery meets in inosculation with the lower branches of the sciatic artery. The lower or descending branch of the perforans prima goes down along the three flexor muscles of the leg, viz. the biceps, semi-tendinosus, and semi-mem- branosus; nourishes their fleshy bellies, and plays over their surface in beautiful net-work. ARTERIA PERFORANS SECUNDA MAGNA. The second or great perforating artery is a much larger and more important branch of the pro- funda than this first, at least it is so when the other perforating branches are wanting, and when this, as often happens, represents the continued trunk of the artery: but I shall describe it as a second perforating artery, to be succeeded by others*. The second per- forating artery comes oft' from the profunda, about two inches lower than the first; it passes through be- twixt the first and second heads of the triceps, or * My reason for saying this is, that sometimes there are but two perforating arteries, while there are often five which need to be described.

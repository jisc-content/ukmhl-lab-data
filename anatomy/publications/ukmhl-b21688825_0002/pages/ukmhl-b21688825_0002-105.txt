53 OF THE PERICARDIUM, •Some after him said, it was the fat of the heart melted down by incessant motion and the heat of the heart; some said it was from humours exuding through the heart itself, and retained by the density of the pericar- dium that this water came; and it is but a few years since this clear and distinct account of it was given, viz. “ that it proceeds from the aqueous excremen- titious humour of the third concoction.” The same “ sad and learned men*, viri graves et docti,” de- clare to us, that the uses of the aqua pericardii are to cool the heart, for it is the very hottest thing in the body; or by its acrimony to irritate the heart, and support its motions; or to make the heart by swim- ming in it seem lighter. By this it is pretty obvi- ous what absurd notions they had of the quantity of water that may be found in the heart. But of all the outrages against common sense and common decorum, the most singular was the dispute maintained among them,-whether it was or was not the water of the peri- cardium which rushed out when our Saviour’s side was pierced with the spear ? The celebrated Bardius, in a learned letter to Bartholine, shows how it was the water of the pericardium that flowed out ; but Bartholine, in his replication thereunto, demonstrates, that it must have been the water of the pleura alone. This abo- minable and ludicrous question, I say, they bandied about like boys rather than men : Bartholinus, Arius Montanus, Bertinus Nicelius, Fardovius, Laurenber- gius, Chiprianus, with numberless other Doctors and * They are thus denominated in all the charters of the College of Physicians from the time of Henry VIII. downwards.

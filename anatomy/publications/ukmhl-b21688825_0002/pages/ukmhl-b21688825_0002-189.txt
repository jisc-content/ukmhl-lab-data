isr OF RESPIRATION. Royal Academy of France. He is farther back in physiology than Oligerius, Jacobaeus, or Malpighi.— The Frog has a respiration peculiar to itself, or at least to its kind. FIRST SPECIES OF RESPIRATION, VIZ. BY A DIA^ PH RAG M. Under this title I shall explain the respiration of Man, and of animals like Man; which have heavy lungs, of a strong fleshy texture, a prodigious num- ber of blood-vessels passing through them, their lungs lodged entirely in the chest, and their respiration performed by a diaphragm.—I mean to arrange re- spiration according to the mechanism of those organs by which it is performed ; and place in the first order that of Man, and animals which in this point resem- ble Man ; and I say respiration by a diaphragm, for this is indeed the only use of a diaphragm. The sup- port of the great blood vessels, the compression of the viscera, the expulsion of the urine and foeces, the rid- ding the womb of its burden $ all could have been performed by the pressure of the abdominal muscles alone! the diaphragm is added merely for breathing. Forsaking, for a moment, authority and minute anatomy, let us explain it in the shortest and most in- telligible way.—The diaphragm divides the thorax from the abdomen; it is strong, muscular, and acts with great power, enlarging the thorax ; it is convex towards the breast, and concave towards the belly: when it acts, the belly is protruded, the diaphragm becomes |lat, the thorax enlarged, and a vacuum would

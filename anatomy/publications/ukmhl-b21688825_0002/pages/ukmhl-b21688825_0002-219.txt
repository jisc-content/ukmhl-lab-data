Of these curious particulars, the openings of the air-tubes are best seen in the Worm from which the common Butterfly is produced; we count these holes down the sides one, two, three; we name them puncta respira- toria, spiracula, or most commonly stigmata: (Vide fi- gure 1.) Their transparency and brillancy is well un- derstood from the view of the microscopic Louse, (fi- exquisite branchings through the various parts are well seen in the drawing of the air-tubes which run along the wings cf a Bee (figure 4.), or those which twist and ramify gure 2.) That particu- lar form in which they resemble more the lungs of animals is seen in the pulmonic bags (a a)—and the tracheas or air-tubes (bb—of the common Bee, (figure 3.) Their VOL. II. round

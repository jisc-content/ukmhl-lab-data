OF THE THREE ARTERIES 492 massa carnea ; it turns its first turn outwards, till St gets under the flexor and abuctor of the little toe ; then it turns inwards towards the centre of the foot, and lies under the tendons of the long muscles, and over the metatarsal bones and their interosseous muscles. First it sends a large branch backwards to the heel- bone, which belongs entirely to that spongy bone, forms, like all suck arteries, a sort of net-work over all the surface of the bone; it first touches the bone under its extreme point, or that which rests upon the ground; and it'goes branching over it so high as to inosculate round the ankle with twigs of the tibialis antica; it gives branches also hereabout to the great ligament of the heel-bone. ' The external plantar artery next giyes branches to those muscles betwixt which it lies imbedded, viz. the massa carnea and flexor brevis; then advancing to the side of the flexor digiti minimi, it gives out two or three branches, which first go into the flesh of the abductor and flexor of the little toe, and then turning over the edge of the foot, terminate in inosculations with the arteries of the fore- part of the foot and in the skin. It then begins from the root of the metatarsal bone of the little toe to form that great circle which is named the arch of the foot,'and which gives out two ranks of arteries: First, Of interosseous arteries going to the spaces betwixt the metatarsal bones upon which the toes stand ; and, Secondly, The proper arteries of the toes themselves. The first of these arteries proceeding from the tar- sal arch is a small one, the artery of the little toe. It begins at the lower head of the metatarsal bone, lies under

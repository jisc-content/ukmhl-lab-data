â€¢F THE ARTERIES 432 Before the emulgent arteries enter into the substance of the kidney to be thus distributed, they usually give off small arteries, as has been already mentioned, to the lower part of the capsula renalis, to the upper part of the ureter, and to the fat surrounding the kidney. ArteRia spermatica. The spermatic ar tery, or artery of the testicle? is one of the most singular, both for its extreme small- ness and great length, and for its important office. It arises on each side from the lateral parts of the aorta, a ^little above the lower mesenteric artery. The left spermatic artery rises somewhat higher, and often comes from the ernulgent artery; it descends from the aorta almost in the same line with itself; it crosses the vena cava, and meets its accompanying vein upon the surface of the psoas muscle: it then forms the spermatic chord, and passes out through the ab- dominal ring ; before it goes down into the testicle, it gives out many very small twigs. First, It gives small twigs to the fat of the kidneys; secondly. It gives small branches to the ureters; thirdly, Small twigs to the peritonem ; and lastly, Small twigs to nourish the spermatic cord itself. When it has passed through the ring, it soon after divides into many small arteries for the several parts of the testicle, four or five in number; two of which go to the epidydimis, and two others, particularly large, go to the testicle ; the largest of these branches turns round the testicle in a beautiful and serpentine form, waving along the upper part of the testicle, viz. just under the epidydimis, and sending beautiful coronary branches down -

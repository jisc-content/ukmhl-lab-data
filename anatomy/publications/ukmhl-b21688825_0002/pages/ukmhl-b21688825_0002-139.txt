OF THE BLOOD. 87 I think I may safely conclude, that these theorists have done the science no vood; themselves no ho- nour; and us no kind of benefit, unless it be an ad- vantage to know that by none of these ways can we arrive at a knowledge of the blood. QUALITIES OF THE BLOOD. Blood is a fluid of a rich and beautiful colour; it is vermilion-coloured in the arteries, strong purple in the veins, and black, or almost so, at the right side of the heart; it feels thick and unctuous betwixt the fingers, is of a slightly saline taste, is various in vari- ous parts of the body, in the heart or at the centre of the circulation different from what it is in the glands, excretories, and all the extremities of the body; dif- ferent in the liver, among the intestines, in the cheeks, apd lips, in the reservoir or sinuses of the head and womb. In various individuals, but much more in different animals, it varies with their functions and manner of life; it is more or less perfect in animals, in birds, in fishes, in inserts; it is thick or thin; has gross particles or small; is red or pale; hot or cold; ac- cording to the creatureâ€™s life: and from this last va- riety, viz. of the manner of life: comes our division of animals into those of hot and cold blood. It is by the most simple and natural methods that we examine the blood; since almost spontaneously it resolves itself into three parts; the crassamenium, the serum, and the red globules; for in a cup of blood the crassamentum, Or clot, the hepar sangui- neum, as it was called long ago, floats in the serum; G 4 "

35 OF THE HEART. D 2 directly, and to keep as clear of each other as the arrows by which such currents are usually represented. This error in reasoning is below all criticism; it car- ries us backwards a hundred years in anatomy and in physics; and yet this is all that Winsl w, Haller, Sabbatier, and a mob of others, have been able to say in proof of the connection of the Eustachian valve with the circulation of the fetus. Lancisi, again, believed that it was chiefly useful by supporting the blood of the lower cava, defending it from the weight of that column of blood which is continually descending from above; and Winslow and others approved of this, as being perhaps one u,e of the valve. But they have all of them forgotten a little circumstance, which must affect the office of the valve, and which should have been regarded espe- cially by those who said it was useful chiefly before birth; they have forgotten a little circumstance, which John Blunter also forgot, when theorizing about the gubernaculum testis, viz. that the child lies with its head downmost for nine months in the mother’s womb. Nothing is more certain than that the Eustachiaii valve is not peculiar to the fetus; that it has no com nection with the oval hole; that the valve is often par- ticularly large after‘the foramen ovale is closed; that the valve is often obliterated where yet the foramen ovale remains open; that in adults it is more easily demon- strated than in children; that in old age it is often, reticulated as the other valves are. Its use relates nei- ther to the foramen ovale, nor to the ascending cava 5 it relates to the auricle itseh, and therefore it is found

OF THE BLOOD. 93 There is no part of our food which does not contain this gluten in a large proportion. With regard to animal food, this is to be remembered, that except the fat and the earth of bones (which is in a wonder- fully small proportion), the whole is gluten. A piece of animal food we can first wash clear of its blood till it be colourless, and then boil with a strong heat till it is converted into jelly merely. Eggs contain an animal gluten separated and entirely formed; the final use of which is to enter into the intestines of the chick, and nourish it. Milk contains in its curdy part a perfect gluten, which is easily separated, and when perfect coagulates with acids like blood. Oysters, shell-fish, fishes of all kinds, are so entirely formed of gluten, that many of them can be boiled down to a perfect jelly. With regard to our vegetable food, this is to be remembered, that much of it is already formed intb gluten, and is ready to be assimilated into an ani- mal nature. If we knead up flour with cold water into a cake, the washing of that cake resembles the process of washing acoagulum of blood; for while we hold it in our hand, and pour cold water upon it, the water as it runs off carries along with it a white amy- laceous matter, which is starch; along with this there is much saccharine and mucilaginous matter; but the most dense and solid part of the cake remains in the hand. This is the gluten of the vegetable left alone, just as the gluten of the animal is washed pure of the red blood; and this vegetable gluten is very tough, so that the whole cake may be drawn out into one long string. It is so tenacious and so hard when dry, that it has been long used as a cement; and it so precisely resembles

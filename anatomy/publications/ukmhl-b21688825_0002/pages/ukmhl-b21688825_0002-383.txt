317 OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. Tates the cerebellum from the brain, which closes the ventricle behind, and which covers the pineal gland, and is a membrane or velum to it also; the pineal gland, nates, and testes, being situated neither in any of the ventricles, nor on the surface of the brain, but betwixt the surface of the brain and cerebellum, where the one lies upon the other. After this second branch to the internal surfaces, the great trunk of the posterior cerebri branches pro- fusely like a tree all over the back part of the brain, inosculating forwards with the middle artery of the brain, and also with the artery of the corpus cal- losum. Thus is the whole brain supplied with blood ; and next in order come the arteries of the spinal marrow. ยง. 2. OF THE ARTERIES OF THE SPINAL MARROW. I have mentioned none of those smaller arteries which the vertebral gives off before entering the skull, because being destined chiefly for the spinal marrow, they belong to this second class. The vertebral artery, as it mounts along its canal to- wards the head, gives at each step, or as it passes each vertebra, a delicate twig; these little arteries pass through the intervertebral spaces, go to the deeper muscles

OF THE ARTERIES 404 arises highest from the forepart of the aorta; it gives two branches, one to the right side of the lungs, and one to the left; the right branch gives an artery to the oesophagus, and sometimes the whole of the right branch goes to that part. 2. ARTERIA BRONCHIALIS DEXTRA. The right bronchial artery sometimes, like the common bronchial, comes off from the aorta; but very often it comes off from the upper intercostal ar- tery. It goes round the right branch of the trachea, and belongs to that side of the lungs alone: but it gives, notwithstanding, some branches to other parts, especially to the oesophagus, to the back of the peri- cardium, and to the posterior mediastinum, or mem- brane which strides across the aorta. 3. ARTERIA BRON HIALIS SINISTRA. The left bron chial artery comes off along witj| the bronchialis communis from the forepart of the aorta; it goes to the left side of the lungs, and also affords small branches to the oesophagus and neigh- bouring parts. 4. ARTERIA BB0NCHIALI3 INFER 10 R. Often there is a fourth bronchial artery, which we would call bronchialis inferior, or the lower bronchial artery, because it comes off lower than these , commonly about the place of the fifth rib. It goes to the back of the heart, where tire pulmonic â–  *ein of the left side expands into the auricle, and taking

Of the subclavian artery. 348 Thirdly, The mammary gives also the upper artery of the diaphragm, its lower artery being the first branch of the aorta within the abdomen. This upper artery of the diaphragm is named arteria comes nervi phrenci, because it accompanies the phrenic nerve. The phrenic nerve is passing from the neck (where it arises) into the chest, by the side of the axil- lary artery, when it receives from the mammary this small artery which goes along with it 5 and this artery (which is so extremely small that nothing but its re- gularity can give it any importance) goes down through the whole chest, accompanying the phrenic nerve over the pericardium till they arrive together on the upper surface of the diaphragm, and spread out there. This artery, small as it is, gives twigs as it passes along to almost all the parts within the chest. Fourthly, The mammary gives an artery to the pericardium, which may be called the upper peri- cardiac artery ; and which is of such importance, that generally when it does not come off from the mammary, it comes from the subclavian itself, or even from the aorta. It belongs to the upper and back part of the pericardium. Fifthly, The pericardium has another artery from the mammary, which belongs to that part of the heart which is united to the diaphragm: it is thence named by some arteria phrenico-pericardiaca. Sixthly, The mammary gives many small arteries to the mediastinum; for the mammary is covered only by the sterno-costalis muscle, which is often hardly visible in Man, so that the artery may be said to lie upon 1

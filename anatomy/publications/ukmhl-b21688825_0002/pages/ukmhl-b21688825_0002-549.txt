OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 477 forates the shorter head of the biceps fiexor-cruris; it then emerges upon the thigh by the belly of the vastus externus muscle. Before itcrossesacross the ham, it gives a branch to the semi-membranosus: while it is passing through the flesh of the biceps, it gives a lower nutritious artery to the lower and back part of the thigh-bone; after ifperforates the biceps allitsbranches are to the flesh of the biceps and vastus externus, and its extreme branches are spent in inosculation with the descending branch of the reflex or articular artery of the hip-joint. But these branches, which are the last of the femo- ral artery, are extremely irregular. There is no artery from the profunda downwards worth naming, not even those which I have just described*. POPLITEAL ARTERY. The artery having passed through the ring or ten- don of the triceps which is formed for it, or rather having passed betwixt the triceps and the bone, lies flat against the flat part of the thigh-bone as deep as possible in the cavity of the ham. There, as no muscles are lodged, it can give no muscular arteries of * " Confiieri tamen opertet, binos ultimos ramos in distribu- endis suis surculis infinite ludere, ita ut descriptione ad quod cun- que cadaver adaptata vix, ac ne vix quidem comprehendi possint.

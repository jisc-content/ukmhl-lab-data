321 ARTERIES OF T HE EYE. posterior spinal arteries which arise, not from the basi- lar or vertebral arteries like the anterior, but usually from the arteria anterior cerebri; and they are smaller than the anterior spinal artery: Secondly, These two arteries give small twigs to the bottom of the fourth ventricle, and then go round from the fore to the back part of the medulla oblongata ; but there, instead of uniting like the beginnings of the anterior artery, they continue separate, run down the spinal marrow as two distinct arteries, with very frequent inosculations betwixt them. This artery is also unlike the other in respect of its termination, for it disappears at-the second vertebra of the loins. Its inosculations with the arteries from without are very free. ยง. 3. ARTERIES OF THE EYE. The arteries of the eye come from one branch only, the ophthalmic artery, the branch which the carotid, when it touches the anterior clynoid process, sends into the orbit along with the optic nerve. But small as this original artery is (no bigger than a crow- quill), the system of arteries, which arises from it is very great; whether we consider their number, the irregular parts which they supply, or the great inos- culations which they form even with the outward arteries of the nose and face.

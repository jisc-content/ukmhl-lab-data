OF THE BLOOD. 76 mathematics, then through anatomy and all its glands, then through metaphysics ; till at lastwearecome to talk with the most perfect ease and confidence about the most monstrous of all absurdities, the life of the blood. “ For in the blood is the life thereof,” might be a useful doctrine among the Jews, if it moderated their desire for blood; and if among physicians this were to be the tendency of such a doctrine, it were very cruel and unnatural to disturb it: but, in serious ear- nest, it introduces into modern physiology nothing but a jargon of words, and perverts every idea that the mind of man can form of parts which excite and parts vCdiich act. Whimsical theories creep faster into phy- sic than useful facts; and the business is fairly enotigh begun when surgeons, dissecting aneurisms of the ca- rotid arteries, and who should be employed in record- ing how and from what causes they have arisen, or how such diseases affect the arterial coats, choose ra- ther to info; m us “ that this state of the blood, or rather of the coagulable lymph, may arise from some connection or sympathy it may have with the diseased state of the artery.” “ By lightning (says a cele- brated author), death is so instantaneously produced in the muscles, that they cannot be affected by the stimulus of death ” Connections, and unknown sym- pathies, and living powers in fluids, and energies, and efforts, and intentions, and “ sympathetic congela- tions in the blood,” and “immediate sympathetic contiguous harmonies of cut parts,” and the “ diffused principle of life,” and “ the stimulus of death;” are words which physiology would gain by losing, and are tl*q

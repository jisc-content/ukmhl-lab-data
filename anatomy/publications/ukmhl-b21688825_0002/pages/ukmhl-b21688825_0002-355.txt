OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 291 in the body : For the womb itself has its arteries more tortuous at the end of pregnancy than at its com- mencement; and the stomach, the bowels, the blad- der, although they suffer greater and more sudden distention than the womb, have arteries which are very straight in their course. Are there any curling arteries in the muscles which contract to one half their diameter? are there any in the joints which twist and bend so freely? are there any curling arte- ries in the whole system of a child? are there any arteries in the whole system of an aged person which want this tortuous form? In short, this tortuous form has no relation to the dilatation of the parts: It is merely a consequence of the long continued pressure of the blood: it is this only that can account for the slowly increasing tortuosity in the temples or hands of an old man, or the sudden tortuosity which the newly dilated artery assumes after the operation for aneurism. Next it is natural to observe, as a thing which may prevent confusion in the studentâ€™s mind, how irregu- lar (after all our attempts at arrangement) the smaller arteries unavoidably must be; how natural it is that each particular part should draw its blood from all the arteries which are near or round it. The ear has its posterior artery peculiar to itself; but it has also an anterior artery from the temporal, where it lies under the parotid gland; and it has even a superior auris from that branch of the temporal artery, which bends round towards the occiput, and arches over the ear. The dura mater has its great middle artery ap- propriated to itself, a peculiar branch, the first of the U 2 maxillary

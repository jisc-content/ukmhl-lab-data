I i 3 arteries p CF THE IvEG AND FOOT. 4SS the forepart and outer side of the foot, gives twigs to the short extensor of the toes, and ends in inoscula- tions with the tarseal arteries, or arteries belonging to the forepart of the foot. The arteries which belong to the forepart of the foot are usually three in number : One goes off from the tibial artery a little above the ankle-joint, and is named Arteria Tarsea, because it crosses the foot over the bones of the tarsus. To this succeeds a second about the distance of half an inch from it, and which crosses the foot at the place of the metatarsal bones ; it is named Arteria Metatarsea: and the one or other of these gives the interosseous arteries, accordingly as the one or the other is small or wanting. 1 he third is that remarkable branch which goes forwards along the great toe, whence it is named Arteria Halucis. ARTERIA TARSEA. The tarseal artery, which is sometimes of a very considerable size, almost equal to the tibialis it- self, comes off a little below the ankle, upon the fore- part of the foot. It lies upon the second rank of the tarsal bones ; it passes under the head of the extensor brevis of the foot; it crosses the foot obliquely, so as to end in the abductor muscle of the little toe, and in inosculations with the arches of the sole of the foot. This branch gives small inosculating arteries up- wards, which first give branches to the joint, and then join with the external malleolar and peroneal arteries. Next it gives branches to the bones and joints of the tarsus, which it lies upon ; as the cuboid and cunei- form bones, and their joints. Thirdly, It gives small

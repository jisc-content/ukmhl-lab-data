OF THE SUBCLAVIAN 'ARTERY. 35 7 to annihilate as it were all the other branches of the artery from which it arises. Where this artery passes out of the chest it is covered only by the root of the mastoid muscle ; and it gives twigs to the mastoid, to the muscles which ascend to the throat, to the subclavian muscle, to the fat, jugular vein, and skin. Next it gives a superficial branch to the skin, trapezius, and other superficial parts about the shoulder. Next it turns over the acromion process, passes through the suprascapular notch, with many wind- ings and contortions; spreads itself over all the outer surface of the scapula, both above and below the spine, and is the sole suprascapular artery. The manner of its spreading is this ; having passed through its hole in company with the suprascapular nerve, the instant that it has passed the hole and begins to lie flat upon the scapula, it sends off two branches one on either hand at right angles; and of these one goes along the upper border of the scapula towards its basis, the other goes in the other direction towards the shoulder-joint, and circles round the upper side of the spine or ridge of the scapula. The main artery having first perforated the scapular notch, and given these two small branches, next makes a second perforation, viz. by passing under the root of the acromion process; and then it again divides into large branches, in which it ends. The one branch runs all along the root or base of the spine or high ridge ; the other branch runs nearly in the same direction, but lower down, viz. nearer that edge A a 3 where

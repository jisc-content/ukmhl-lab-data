OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 36$ 5. ARTERIA sub-scapularis. The subscapular artery is of a great size; it is hardly described in books, I might say is hardly known to anatomists. Douglas, and most especially Sabbatier, have scarcely named it, though it is in fact one of the largest arteries in the body, being absolutely as large as the axillary artery, from which it takes its rise*. The greatest mass of flesh in almost any part of the body is that which lies under and around the scapula in a strong man; and this artery supplies almost all that mass. It goes off from the axillary opposite to the neck of the scapula, just under the long head of the biceps brachii: it no sooner comes off from the axil, lary artery, than it attaches itself to the lower border of the scapula; and as soon as it comes to the edge of the scapula (but sometimes lower down the edge, viz. where the head of the biceps comes off) it splits into two great branches; one of which goes to the upper, and one to the lower surface. But to describe each little artery among such a mass of flesh, or to expect to find them regular would be very thoughtless; the general course of them only can be described. First, The greater branch which goes to the lower surface of the scapula, is the proper trunk of the subscapular * It is named often scapularis inferior or infra-scapularis ; it is better named subscapular, both to harmonize with the name sub- scapular muscle, to which it belongs; and also to contrast with its counterpart, the suprascapular artery, which comes from the subcla- vian artery. artery;

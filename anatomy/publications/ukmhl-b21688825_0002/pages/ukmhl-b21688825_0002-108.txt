56 OF THE PERICARDIUM, fort of the thorax. By matter collected within the thorax it may be displaced to any degree. Dr. Far- quharson cured a fine boy, about eight years old, of a great collection of matter in the chest, whose heart was so displaced by a vast quantity (no less than four pounds) of pus, that it beat strongly on the right side of the breast while his disease continued, and as soon as the pus was evacuated, the beating of the heart returned naturally to the left side. Who could have believed that, without material injury, the heart could be so long and so violently displaced ? Felix Platerus tells us a thing not so easily believed, that a young boy, the son of a printer, having practised too much that trick which boys have of going upon their hands with their head to the ground, began to feel ter- rible palpitations in the left breast; these gradually increased till he fell into a dropsy from weakness, and died; and upon dissecting his body, the situa- tion of. his heart was found to have been remark- ably changed by this irregular posture. Now we are not to argue that such change of posture of the heart; pould not happen merely from this cause, because pro- fessed tumblers haye not these diseases of the heart; it were as silly to argue thus against the authority of Platerus, as to say that every post-boy has not aneurisms of the ham, or that every chimney-sweep has not a cancer of the scrotum. We may now close this chapter on the mechanism of the heart, in which all the parts have been succes- sively explained. We know how the heart is suspended by the mediastinum and by its great vessels; how it

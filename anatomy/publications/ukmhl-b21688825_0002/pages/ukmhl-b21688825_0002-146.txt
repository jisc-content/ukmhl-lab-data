OF THE BLOOD; Pi resembles the animal gluten, that, put them together** and you can see no distinction. It shrinks also with heat, and is converted into a substance like parchment or horn. It first melts with heat, and then burns like feathers or hair; and by distillation it gives only alkaline ainmoniacal salts and fetid oils; it wants no mark of perfect analogy with our animal gluten, and we can be at no loss to think whence all our necessary supplies arise: and flour, though it is the richest, in this highly nutritious part scarcely exceeds corn, barley, potatoes, pease and beans, and all those vegetables called legumina, upon which chiefly we depend for bread, or a substitute for bread. These do not, indeed, contain this vegeto-animal matter directly or entirely formed; but they consist of a jelly analogous to all the white or gelatinous parts of the human body; as vege- table jelly, it has a vegetable character, it ferments and becomes acid; while animal jelly, as belonging to the animal body, has other characters, it becomes putrid, and affords alkalis only: but how easy this conversion must be, 1 need hardly suggest. What passes within the animal body, or how this gluten is directly applied, we never can know; but we see how all the body is composed of gluten, and no analysis of any single part has ever disappointed us. A muscle being squeezed, and thoroughly cleansed of blood, washed in spirits of wine, and again cleaned, is seen plainly to be but a peculiar form of coagulable lymph. An anatomical preparation washed, and purified as it is, consists of mere lymph retain- ing its primitive shape. A bone being infused in any mineral acid, or in vinegar, its earthy parts are dissolved

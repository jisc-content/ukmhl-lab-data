395 OF THE FOREARM. ARTERIA ARTERIA RADIALIS INDICIS. The artery of the forefinger proceeding from the radial artery is the first and smallest of these three branches. It goes off at the root of the metacarpal bone of the forefinger, goes up along its interosseous muscie, and runs along all the edge of the forefinger next the thumb, inosculating with the artery of the opposite edge, which comes from the ulnar arch ; it sendsoff twigs at its root, which inosculate with the small dorsal arteries of the thumb; and it gives a branch to the adductor addicis. ARTERIA MAGNA POLLICIS. The chief artery of the thumb rises along its metacarpal bone, a single artery, and there splits commonly, I think, into three smaller branches. Two of these run along the forepart of the thumb up to its extremity, and inosculate there; the one running along the radial, the other along the ulnar side, till they meet at the point. These are, as it were, coun- terparts of the dorsal arteries, but greatly larger, the thumb being naked on the back, but fleshy where it looks towards the palm. Another branch of the arteria pollicis is one which turns across to the palm of the hand, and makes a smaller and more superficial inosculation with the palmer arch.

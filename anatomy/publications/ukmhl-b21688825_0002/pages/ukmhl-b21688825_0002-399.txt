arteries of the eye. the 335 upon the face. They are the supra-orbitary artery, the artery of the tipper eyelid, the artery of the lower eyelid, the artery of the forehead, and the artery of the nose. 1. ARTERIA SUPRA-ORBITALIS. The supra-orbitary artery is so named from its emerging from the socket by that notch in the super- ciliary ridge which we call the supra-orbitary hole. It comes off from the ophthalmic artery at the place where it gives off the ciliary and lower muscular arteries: it so often gives off the arteries which go to the upper muscles of the eye, that some have named it the superior muscular artery. It passes onwards, giving twigs to the levators of the eye and of the eye- lid, and to the upper oblique muscles, and to the periosteum; and before it arrives at the supra-orbitary hole, it divides into two twigs ; of which one lies deep, and supplies the periosteum of the forehead, inoscu- lating with the temporal artery; the other lies more superficial, but still is covered by the orbicularis and corrugator supercilii, on which muscles it bestows all its branches. 2. ARTERIJE PALPEBRALES. THE-two palpebral arteries arise from the' oph- thalmic after it has passed the tendon of the obliquus superior, when it has in a manner emerged from the socket, and is lying at the inner angle of the eye: there it commonly gives off two small arteries, one to

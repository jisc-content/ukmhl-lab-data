308 OF THE ARTERIES. the continued trunk of the carotid; it is larger than the artery at the wrist; it goes directly outwards, viz. towards the temple; it runs along the fossa Syivii, and is lodged deep in that cleft; where it lies deep, it divides into two great branches, one deep and one superficial; it gives some branches to the anterior lobe, but it is chiefly limited to the middle lobe of the brain; its branches to the posterior lobe, or inoscula- tions with any branches of the basilar artery, are com- paratively few. Thus the artery ends by passing into the substance of the brain. But nearer the sella turcica and before it enters into the fossa Sylvii, it gives some small and delicate arteries; the consideration of which seems to be unimportant at first view, but which is really useful in explaining the anatomy of the brain. It gives small twigs to the pituitary gland, to the optic nerve, to the tentorium, and especially to the pia ma- ter covering the basis of the brain. Among these small twigs certain sets of arteries make a very distin- guished figure. 1. There is one small artery which runs up into the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle, and forms that great plexus which lies along the floor of the ven- tricle, named plexus choroides. This, then, is the ARTERY of the CHOROID PLEXUS. 2. There is a set of arteries, of considerable num- ber, but varying in respect of number, small as sew- ing threads, which inosculate repeatedly with each other, and which are scattered widely and beautifully over the crura cerebri and basis of the brain, forming iu the pia mater a plexus or web of vessels.

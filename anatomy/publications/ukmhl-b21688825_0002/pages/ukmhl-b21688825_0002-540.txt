OF THE FE MORAL ARTERY. 468 of the circumflex artery, and they inosculate in a most particular manner with a large anastomosing branch from the femoral artery. The larger branch of this artery emerges from betwixt the rectus and vastus ex- ternus, a little above the knee, to inosculate with one of the articular arteries of the knee. Its smallest branch inosculates with the anastomosing branch of thefemoral artery. The two anastomoses seem to be the chief use of these two long arteries, though they do also send some branches to the muscles. But to give a more simple notion of this circum- flex artery, it should be described thus. Is is divided into three chief branches: 1st, A descending branch, which goes down to the knee-joint; 2nd, A transverse branch, which crosses the upper part of the thigh, and turns round the neck of the thigh-bone; 3dly, It sends a less important branch up upon the dorsum ilii. ARTERIA CIRCUMFLEXA INTERNA. The internal circumflex artery is a thick short artery, which goes off opposite to the ball of the thigh-bone; and as the external one goes round the great trochanter, this goes round the lesser trochanter. It is a smaller artery; it has not so many muscular branches; it keeps closer to the joint; it goes off from the inner side of the profunda, just opposite to the circumflexa externa, or a little lower, but never more than an inch lower ; it passes over the insertion of the psoas muscle, and under the belly of the pecti- nalis; it attaches itself then to the lesser or inner tro- chanter, and goes round the neck of the thigh-bone roun

OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 371 passes along with the nerves through the insterstice of the scaleni muscles; the nerves, which consist of no less than seven pairs, make by their mutual connections a sort of net, which is called the plexus of the axillary nerves. This plexus has its meshes formed, not by small divisions, but chiefly by the seven great cords. This broad plexus lies over the artery as it comes cut from the chest; the artery perforates the plexus, or passes through one of the largest meshes in the cavity of the axilla ; and when we extend the arm, for example, to cut out an axillary gland, the great veins lie nearest the knife, or lowest in the axilla; the plexus of nerves next; and last of all the artery which has just perforat- ed the plexus of these great nervous cords; three nerves are below the artery and two above; and when the arm is luxated, and the shoulder-bone pushed down- wards, the head of it is so pressed against the net of nerves, and the artery is so compressed betwixt the head of the bone and the mesh of nerves, that I have very seldom failed to find the pulse almost entirely sup- pressed in luxations of this kind. This connection, viz. with the nerves, is a very in- teresting one. It is plainly such that the artery can- not be hurt without a wound of the nerves; it has never been known that the artery has been cut in the axilla without the arm being lamed by this wound of the nerves; also the nerves cannot be hurt without the artery being in danger; but it does escape sometimes; of which, among other examples, this is one of the most singular.â€”I have seen the artery escape in wounds when the nerves were hurt; but how it could escape Bb2 he

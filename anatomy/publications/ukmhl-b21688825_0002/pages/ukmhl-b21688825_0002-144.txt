S2 OF THE BLOOD. COAGULABLE LYMPH. The coagulable part, the cake which is left when v/e wash away the red globules, is by far the most im- portant part of the blood, the most universally dif- fused in the animal system, the most necessary for'the supply and growth of parts. It forms all the solids, and in its properties resembles them most curiously; for this cake, when washed, is white, insipid, extremely tenacious, and very fibrous; can be drawn out greatly; and it is the coagulation of this part that makes the long fibrous strings which we find in the tub when bleeding a patient in the foot in very hot water. Being slightly dried, it shrinks into a substance like parch- ment ; being hardened by heat, it becomes like a piece of horn or bone ; when burnt, it shrinks and crackles, with a very fetid smell, like the burning of feathers, wool, flesh, or any other animal substance; by which we know it to be the part of the blood which is the most perfectly animalized, and the most ready to be assimilated with the living solids. When distilled, it gives ammoniacal salt and alkaline water, and a very thick heavy fetid oil, and much mephitis, which are the marks of the most perfect animal nature ; and after burning it, the residuum is a phosphate of lime, or, in other words, the earth of bones. Its ,peculiar properties, as it appears in the blood, are few; its relation to the body is very surprising; how the body acquires, and how it applies, this most im- portant part of the blood, we shall next explain.

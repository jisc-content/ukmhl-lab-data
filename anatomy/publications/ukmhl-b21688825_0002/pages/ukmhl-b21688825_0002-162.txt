HO OF THE BLOOD. mg now combined with heat, it appears in the form of vital air; the air is much purer than that of the at- mosphere which was used in the process, because the metal absorbs or appropriates to itself nothing but the purest air, leaving the azotic or foul air behind: and finally, if you wish to see the harmony betwixt com- bustion and calcination, or to be assured that calcina- tion is truly the burning of a metal, take some of this pure air, which is three times purer than the atmo- sphere, and raises an intenser flame; plunge into it a piece of iron wire, which is made red-hot; and this wire (which would only have wasted or rusted into a calx in the common atmosphere) will in the pure air burst out into a brilliant white flame, and burn entirely while it has such air; nay, some metals, as zinc, burn even in our common atmosphere with a most brilliant flame. From this second process, must it not be presumed that the principle which gives an increase of weight and such singular properties to various metals, must have very interesting effects upon the blood ? Thirdly, it is from this principle also that all acids are formed; and as oxyd is the Greek name for acid, the great Lavoisier has thought fit to give a name to the basis of air, or that principle which is obvious only when operating in such processes as these. He adds to the Greek name for acid that verb which implies the generation of any substance ; he calls it thus oxy- gene, or the principle which generates acids. It were easy to show how truly this great point is supported by all the particular operations in chemistry ; it shall be sufficient to observe a few. When we burn sul- phur

466 OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. their branches from those of the pudica communis, there are usually three. The uppermost is scattered about the fat of the pubis. The middle one goes across the heads of the triceps ; it is longer and larger than the others ; it goes to the side of the scrotum and penis in Men; in Women it is large, and runs into the Lbium pudendi. The lower one of the three goes to the lower parts of the scrotum, and to the skin of the thigh near it. ARTERIA PROFUNDA FEMORIS. Then comes off the profunda femoris, the deep or muscular artery of the thigh. It arises from the femoral artery about four inches below the groin, more or less according to the size of the subject. It turns off from the femoral artery with a bulging, which looks backwards and towards the outside of the thigh. It lies deep in the triangular cavity, upon the face of the iliacus interims and pectinalis muscles. It presently gives off two great arteries, which turn upwards along the joint; one round the outer side, the other round the inner side, of the joint. Then it passes downwards, turns in behind the femoral artery, sinking deeper and deeper towards the backparts of the thigh, It passes down along the face of the triceps muscle; and as it moves along its forepart, it sends through three or four great arteries to the backpart, which are called the perforating arteries of the thigh. And, lastly, the pro- funda itself, or its last branches, passes through the tri- ceps ; and this last branch is named perforans ultima vel descendens femoris. ARTERIA

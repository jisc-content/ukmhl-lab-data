OF THE PELVIS, 4-39 which runs along the forepart of the sacrum, runs along the naked bone, and inosculates with the mid- dle sacral artery: Secondly, Another branch, still larger, dives into each of the sacral holes, which not only nourishes the nerves, and the sheath of the cauda equina, and the bone itself by one branch, but pene- trates by another branch through the posterior sacral hole, and supplies the periosteum, the great ligaments which join the ilium to the sacrum, and the root also of the sacro-lumbalis, and glutseal muscles. From these two branches (viz. to the spine and to the pos- terior muscles), and from the regularity of these five arteries (going from some artery or other into each sacral hole), they may be resembled to the inter- costal and lumbar arteries, to whose office and plan they have succeeded. ARTERIA HYPOGASTRICA. The hypogastric artery is the umbilical artery, of great size and importance in the child ; and even in the adult it still remains, in this sense at least, that though the forepart of it (where it turns up by the side of the bladder) is closed, even that part is still known by a round ligamentous substance, into which it is converted, which we easily trace up to the navel, where the artery meets its fellow of the other side. This artery is even in the adult body pervious down to the side of the bladder, where in Man it gives one long and slender artery, sometimes two, which go to the sides of the bladder; and in Women, small arte- F f 4 ries

7S OF THE BLOOD. It is not easy to say on which of all his proofs Mr* Hunter chiefly relies for establishing a doctrine so im- portant as this is; whether he considers it as a perfect proof of the vitality of the blood that it coagulates, or that this coagulum has moreover the power of becom- ing perfectly alive, and of forming new vessels within itself; or that blood seems to assist the union of conti- guous parts; or that by taking away its blood a crea- ture dies; or that a limb falls into immediate gan- grene when its vessels and its supply of blood are cut off. But chiefly he seems to rely on coagulation as a proof of the vitality of the blood; for he considers the coagulation of the chvle as a proof that it also is alive ; and he says, “ contraction is the life of the solids; and if we can find any thing like it ^by which he means coagulation), we shall call it the living principle of the blood. ” But what harmony he can find betwixt the occa- sional, voluntary, regulated, contractions of the living solid, and this sudden, irretrievable, inorganic, coa- gulation of the blood, I cannot conceive. Does not jelly coagulate; and what is it but a part of the blood ? Does not glue congeal, dissolve, and congeal again, yet what is it but an animal jelly ? Does the blood itself ever congeal till it is out of the body, or extravasated in aneurismal sacs? When it is out of the body, it coagulates; when it coagulates, it is dead; coagulation is so far from resembling the con- tractions of the living body, that it is the marked character of dead animal, matter, which you melt and coagulate again and again. Shall we then define life by saying, coagulation is the mark of the yital prin- ciple ?

OF RESPIRATION. 145 THIRD SPECIES OF RESPIRATION, VIZ. THAT OF AM- PHIBIA. This species of respiration differs from the two first in these respects; it differs from the respiration of Man, because there is no diaphragm; it differs from that of birds, for there is no chest covering the lungs : There is a short sternum, no chest, no ribs by which the lungs may be moved, there is no vacuum formed in their respiration ; they fill the lungs by the working of their jaws, or, in other words, they swallow their air just as we swallow our food. The Frog, the Newt, the Chamelion, the Tortoise, and many other creatures, breathe in this way; and as one of the most curious mechanisms for respiration, I shall represent that of the Frog. I have placed at the beginning and end of this chapter two drawings, in which their organs of respiration are seen; for, as I have just explained, their organs of respiration are not in the belly, nor in the lungs themselves, but in. each side one of the many holes by which the frue lungs give out their air to the abdominal vesicles. Figure 2d shows the manner o'f their respiration ; for the air-vesiclesare seen again (1,2, 3,)—filling the whole abdomen. The true lungs are seen at (aJ—lying close by the 3pine, and as high as the root of the neck ; and the length of the sternum and ribs, which are marked (b, c, d, &c.)—show that the fowl is all chest, and that every time the chest rises to the 1 ilie (hhh)—■ the vesicles are dilated, and the air passes through the lungs in the di- rection (i)—and every time the breast is pulled down by the abdo- minal muscles, which are marked (h)—the air is driven out again through the lungs in the direction the lungs being all the while motionless, and passive merely.

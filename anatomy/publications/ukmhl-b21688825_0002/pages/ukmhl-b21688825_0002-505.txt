OF THE PELVIS. 433 the sheath, traces the nerve backwards, and passes into the spinal marrow. 2. A muscular branch, which is also divided; for one branch of it supplies the psoas muscle, and then runs round within the muscles of the abdomen; while the other pierces the back, ard sup- plies the sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and other muscles of the loins. ARTERIES OF THE PELVIS. The aorta divides into two great arteries, named iliac from their beginning in the loins. The two iliac arteries move downwards to the brim of the pelvis, where they meet the veins of the lower extremity ascending to form the cava, and also a vast plexus of lymphatics from the legs and pelvis, which twist round the arteries and veins. The two iliac veins lie upon the inner sides of the two arteries; and since these veins meet on the right dde of the aorta to form the cava, of course the right iliac crosses the trunk of the cava. This bifurcation of the aorta is much higher than the pelvis; it begins upon the fourth vertebra of the loins, so that the abdominal aorta is in truth ex- tremely short, and the iliac arteries go off at such an angle, that they diverge very gradually ; so that when they arrive at the top of the pTvis, they are just over the joining of the haunch-bone with the sa- crum : and it is but %^ery little below this again that they divide into their two great branches; the one named the external iliac, which passes straight F f 2 forward^

127 Of the elogd. OF THE RESPIRATION OF ANIMALS. The effects of oxydation then are, to redden the blood, to renew its stimuJant power, and to commu- nicate heat, not so much to the blood as to the whole body through the medium of the b ood, and to assist in the secretions and chemical changes which are in- cessantly going on in all parts of the system. This is accomplished by the perpetual and rapid motion of the blood through the lungs; and there it is exposed to our atmosphere, which is a mixed fluid very different from what we at first conceive, or what our ignorant wishes m/ght desire to have it; not consisting merely of air fit to be breathed, but for the greatest part formed of an air which is most fatal to animal life, whence it has the name of Azotic Gas. Of an hun- dred measures of atmospheric air, we find twenty- seven only to consist of vital or pure air ; seventy- two consist of azotic air as it is called, fata! to animal life ; and one measure only is fixed air, which is also an unrespirable air. But of these twenty-seven parts of pure air, seventeen parts only are affected by re- spiration ; so that in respiration we use much le s than a fifth part, even of the small quantity of air which we take in at each breath. The change of the air by respiration is this chiefly; that the quantity is diminished by the abstraction of a part of the vital air; that there is formed a quantity of fixed air, which is generated in the lungs ; and that there is discharged along with these a quantity of watery halitus. 1 herefore atmospheric air, after it has been breathed, is found to have suffered these changes: First^ It contains now a considerable propor- tion

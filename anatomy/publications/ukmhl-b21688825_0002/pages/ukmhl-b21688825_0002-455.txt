387 OF THE FOREARM* branch mounts along the forepart of the brachialis internus muscle, and inosculates under the biceps with the lesser or lower profunda. A second anasto- mosing branch goes deeper â– , it passes through the flesh or belly of the brachialis, and anastomoses with the ramos anastomoticus major from above. A third anastomosing branch is the chief branch ; it lies deeper still upon the forepart of the joint, in the hollow which I have lately mentioned : it runs up under the belly of the supinator, along the forepart of the shoul- der-bone, where it inosculates with the upper profunda humeri, and chiefly with its greater branch called spiral artery ; which turns round the bone, and ends here over the outer condyle. This is the recurrens anterior of the radial artery; but none of these branches have I ever seen or felt to be enlarged after operations for aneurism. The suc- cess of that operation depends entirely upon the ar- teries next to be described, viz. the ulnar recurrents, which are always two in number; but sometimes these two recurrents go off in one branch from the ulnar: in which case, viz. of a single recurrent coming off from the ulnar, it divides immediately into two branches, and the one takes the fore and the other the back part of the joint. RECURRENS ULNARiS ANTERIOR. The anterior recurrent of the ulnar artery goes off the first of the branches, immediately before it gives off the interosseous, and where the artery lies deep in its triangular hollow. This anterior artery C c 2 passes

When we make water fall drop by drop into a gun-barrel, heated to a high degree, we find that the oxygene calcines the gun- barrel, the inflammable air is collected in the pneumatic apparatus; and the oxygene which has calcined the iron, and the inflammable air which is received in the glass vessels, exactly account for the quantity of water which has been analysed. Nay, we can carry this process much farther than many of the other delicate processes in chemistry ; we can re-compose this water. If we mix in a jar inflam- mable and pure air, and fire the electric spark through them, water is instantly formed, weighing exactly the quantity of both the airs *. Thus, both by synthesis and analysis, we prove that water is composed of pure and of inflammable air ; we find (what it seems difficult; to believe, though it was foretold by the great New- ton) that water contains an inflammable body; we find, to our great astonishment, while we are regard- ing the atmosphere which surrounds us as the great magazine of air, that water, where its presence never was suspected, contains an infinitely greater quantity of vital air than the atmosphere ; that our atmosphere contains m parts only, while water contains tâ€™stj- of pure air. * These beautiful experiments were first made in England by Priestley, Warlelire, and Cavendish (vide Philosophical Trans- actions, anno !784) : and when Lavoisier .was first told of water being formed by exploding inflammable air, he said it was a i-hine which he could not believe. We

OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY* 461 All these accidents must come upon the surgeon very suddenly; and if they come upon him unprepared, all is in a moment lost. I once saw a fine young fellow die from this alarm of the attendants and confusion of the surgeon. He was a tall, stout, young man, who was sitting at table with his companions eating bread and cheese, taking his glass, and telling his tale. He had in his hand a sharp pointed table knife, which he hap- pened to hold dagger-wise in his hand, and in the height of some assertion or oath he meant to strike the table, but the point missed, and slented over the table ; he had stabbed hirnself in the femoral artery, and with one gush of blood he fell to the ground. When I came, I found the young man stretched out upon the floor; he was just uttering his last groan; the floor was deluged, all slippery, and swimming with blood. The wound was covered with a confused bundle of clothes, which I instantly whirled off; and in that moment two gentlemen, who had been first called, and w'ho had both run off for tourniquets (because tourniquets are used to stop bleedings), re- turned ; and had the unhappiness to see that the hole was no bigger than what I could close, and had actually shut up with the point of my thumb ; and which, had it been shut and put together with a good compress, would have healed in three days, forming a large beaten aneurism within, allowing time for a deliberate operation. In short to enumerate the variety of accidents which may affect this artery would be impossible; but surely from the little that I dare venture to say in this place, it must seem one of the largest, the most exposed.

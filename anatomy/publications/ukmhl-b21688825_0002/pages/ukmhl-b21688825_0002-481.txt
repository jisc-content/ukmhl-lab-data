413 STOMACH, LIVER, AND SPLEEN. from the aorta, and is encircled by the lesser arch of the stomach ; the artery standing up betwixt it and the diaphragm. The coeliac trunk, then, is so placed as to be surrounded by these parts; it has the oeso- phagus on the left hand ; the lobulus spigelii, or lobu- lus papillaris of the liver, on the right hand ; it has the lesser arch of the stomach making its turn under it; and it has the diaphragm above, and the pancreas running across below; it is covered by the delicate web of the omentum, named omentum minus, which goes from the lesser arch of the stomach to the liver and to the spine. Now this short jutting out or stump wc call the trunk of the coeliac artery; or we call it axis arterise coeliacae, for there is no other artery of the body that divides like it: the stump, which is less than half an inch in length, serving as an axis, from which the three great branches, viz. to the stomach, liver, and spleen, go off all at once, in a tripod like form ; one upwards, one to the right, and one to the left. The hepatic, which goes to the right, is largest in the child, because of the great bulk of its liver; the splenic, which goes to the left, is larger in the adalt; the gastric is almost always the smallest of the three. 1* AP.TEP.IA COF.ONAP.IA VENTRICULI. % The coronary artery of the stomach is the central artery of the tripod. When it belongs entirely to the stomach, it is smaller than the splenic or hepatic arteries : but when it gives (as often it does) a branch to the liver, it is the largest of the three. This gastric artery, or coronary artery of the stomach, is generally the

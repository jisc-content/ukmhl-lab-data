The manner of its coming off from the aorta is seen in the first plan in the book, where figure 2. represents truly the Frog’s heart; and there we may observe how small a proportion the pulmonic artery bears to the rest of the arterial system. From these peculiarities of the membranous lungs, it is plain that the oxydation of the blood is a process of small importance in their system; that this process being of little value with them, they are the better enabled to go into the water, and to want breath for a time. But chiefly it appears, that the meaning of this peculiarity is not so much to give them the pri- vilege of Amphibiae, in allowing them to go into the wrater; for many creatures, as the Chamelion, all the tribe of Lizards, Newts, Toads, Serpents, &c. have these lungs, and yet never approach the water: but that the chief use of it is to establish in this class of animals a peculiar constitution, a permanent, al- most inexhaustible, irritability, and a tenaciousness of life; which, I believe, no creature, whether of the land or the water, wants, which has membranous lungs. And when we are told that these creatures can be kept two days under water, as a proof of their being Amphibiae, I cannot but consider it as a very childish proof; for, in the first place, we see them breathing with wonderful regularity when out of the water; when plunged into the water, we see them very soon struggling for breath ! and if they can live for two days without air, it is only because they could L 4 bear

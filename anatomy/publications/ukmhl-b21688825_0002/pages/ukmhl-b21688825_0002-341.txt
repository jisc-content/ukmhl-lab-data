OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 277 tympanum, one of which beautifully surrounds the bony circle, and then spreads upon the membrane it- self ; 2. to the muscle of the stapes, to the semicircular canals, to the cells of the mastoid process and its deli- cate vessels ; which arteries, when well injected with size, paint the walls of the cavity of the tympanum* and of the semicircular canals. The main artery having given off the arteria tym- pani and this stylo mastoid artery, and having passed the stylo-mastoid hole, becomes properly the arteria posterior auris, rising behind the ear, and giving its branches to the skin and mastoid muscle, and to the muscle behind the ear (posterior auris), and to the bone and periosteum, chiefly about the mastoid process; then its small branches play round the back part of the concha or shell of the ear ; and, lastly, the artery, still mounting behind the ear, ends in small twigs, which go to the fascia of the temporal muscle, and which of course inosculate above the ear with the temporal artery. THIRD ORDER, The third order of arteries includes the termina- tion of the external carotid artery in the temporal and maxillary arteries, which is after the following manner: The artery having entered into the parotid gland, lies there absolutely imbedded in its substance; and of the two arteries in which it terminates, one passes directly through the substance of the parotid gland, T 3 emerges

858 OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. where the great subscapular artery runs; and with which;, of course, it makes many free inosculations. This artery lies so across the neck that it may be cut, especially in wounds with the sabre; and in a big man it is such size as to pour out a great quan- tity of blood. It is necessary for the surgeon to remenber the great size of this suprascapular artery, its long course over the shoulder, at what place it arises within the chest, and how it may be compressed. But in another aense also it is peculiarly important; for the suprascapular artery makes inosculation with the lower scapular artery, freer, and fuller than in almost any other part of any limb. One can hardly force tepid water through those small arteries which support the arm after the operation for aneurism ; but the inosculations of this suprascapular artery are so free, that often, though I have tied the arteries with great care, the very coarsest injection has gone round by it; and when I desired only to inject the head, I have found the arteries of the arm entirely filled. The conclusion which this leads to in wounds of the axillary artery is too obvious to need any further explanation. II. OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. This artery assumes the name of axillary, where it lies in the armpit or axilla. The scaleni muscles being attached to the ribs, the artery passes first through butwixt the first and second scalenus; next it passes out from under the arch of the clavicle, where it was protected ;

OF TIIE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 27 6 the carotid; for it is often wanting, or often comes from some branch, and not from the carotid itself 5 often from the occipital, sometimes from the pharyn- geal artery; it can scarcely be reckoned as a regular branch of the carotid. This artery also, like the pharyngeal and occipital, gives out no distinguished branches which we need to mark; it chiefly belongs to the ear, it gives branches to the cartilage of the external ear, it sends a larger branch through the stylo mastoid hole to the internal ear, and the rest of its twigs go to the integuments, or to the bones. The posterior auris arises much higher than any of those arteries which have been just described; it does not come off from the external carotid till it reaches the parotid gland; or, rather, it arises where, the carotid is plunged into the substance of that gland; it passes directly across under the styloid process, and over the belly of the digastric muscle, and then goes up behind the ear ; in this passage it gives branches to the parotid gland, and to the biventer muscle, the parts on which it lies; next it gives a twig, which furnishes the root of the cartilage of the ear, and perforates the lowest part of the cartilage, so as to spread itself upon the drum of the ear; and this branch, named arteria tympani, is particularly large in the child, which has a peculiar conformation, a preternatural membrane covering the drum of the ear. Its next branch, the arteria stylo-mastoidia, is the most remarkable, for it is of considerable size, enters the mastoid hole, while the corda-tympani, or great nerve of the face, comes out: it is a chief artery of the internal ear; for it gives branches, 1. to the tym-

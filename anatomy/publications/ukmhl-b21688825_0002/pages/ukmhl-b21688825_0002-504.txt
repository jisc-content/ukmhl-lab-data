434 OF THE ARTERIES from the aorta itself, or from the iliac artery, where:, the ureter crosses it; and they run far, both upwards and downwards, along the canal. The lowest arteries of the ureter arise from those of the bladder itself. ARTERIT2 LUMBARES. The lumbar arteries are those which succeed to the intercostal arteries, and which run parallel with them; performing the same office in the loins which the intercostals do in the thorax, viz. nourishing the spine and the muscles. The lumbar arteries arise from the sides of the ab- dominal aorta. The first arteries go off at right angles; the lower ones are a little inclined downwards. The light ones are longer, because they have to rise over the spine. The arteries of both sides, as soon as they have left the spine, sink under the psoas muscle, and go onwards behind it, round the side, till they termi- nate in the lateral muscles of the abdomen. The up- permost lumbar artery is large; and as it runs along the lowest rib but one, it Qf course gives arteries both to the transverse or innermost muscle of the belly, and also to the diaphragm, which indigitates with it in consequence of their both taking their origin from the same ribs. The two lower lumbar arteries are small, and begin to inosculate with the lesser arteries about the top of the pelvis. Each lumbar artery gives out like each intercostal two chief arteries: 1. One which goes to the spine, and which, splitting into two, gives a larger twig to the vertebra itself j and a smaller one, which enters the

OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. §69 who learn things by hearsay, have said that “ the sub" ciavian artery could be compressed by thrusting the thumb in above the clavicle;’’ although, in fact, the arch is so deep, the muscles so strong, and the artery so little exposed, that this is absolutely impossible. From my speaking with a seeming interest about the preference of one of these two places tc the other, it may be thought that I believe this piece of knowledge useful: Quite the reverse! I know it to be dangerous; I know it to be less practicable than authors report and believe; and I repeat what I said on a former occasion, that “ it is easy to stop the pulse of an artery, but quite another matter to stop the flow of blood through it.” We thrust down our hands and compresses, and rest with our whole weight upon the artery ; it seems stop- ped, because the pulse is stopped; but the first stroke of the knife shows us how far we are gone in a dangerous mistake. I may say, without breach of confidence, that I have seen one gentleman trust to it, who will never trouble himself about it again. He was a dex- terous surgeon; and in a great aneurism of the axilla was deluged with blood at the first stroke of the knife, and saved his patient only by a plunge of the great needle. Secondly, It is much to be lamented that we can- not really suppress the blood; not merely because it to compress the artery in the dead subject is the want of resist- ance in all the muscles. If ever it be possible in the living body, it must be when llie strength is low, and the circulation very lan- guid, after the patient has tainted with loss of blood. Von. II. B b would

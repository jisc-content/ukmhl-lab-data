OF THE BLOOD. 125 snation, or, in other terms, in every local disease, via, the temperature changed, withoutany apparent depend- ence on that of the system at large. We perceive in the clearest manner that heat is continually formed in all the extremities of the system; and when we think of the processes which are continually going on in various parts, we cannot but believe that oxygene is completely assimilated, and gives out its heat, not when it is received into the blood, with which it seems so slightly united, but when it is distributed through the body, and assimilated with its parts, of which it forms so important a principle. In the human body various acids are produced; the phosphoric acid; the lithic acid, or that which is excreted by the urine ; the acidum pingue, or acid of fat, for fat is a proper oxyd from which this animal ado can be easily obtained. In Ants and other animals peculiar acids are formed: these certainly are direct proofs that the oxygene is deposited from the blood. But in reflecting upon this most difficult of all sub- jects, the generation of heat in the living body, many things are to be taken into the calculation, which seem, on the slightest glance, to be far more im- portant than this deposition of oxygene from the blood. It is a law of nature, to which, as far as we know, no exception is found, that a body while it passes from an aerial to a fluid form, or from a fluid to a solid form, gives out heat. Now, what is the whole business of the living system but a continual assimi- lation of new parts, making them continually pass from a fluid into a solid form ? The whole nourish- ment of the body goes on in the extreme vessels, and . is

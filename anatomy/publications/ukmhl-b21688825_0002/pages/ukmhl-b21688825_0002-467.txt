S99 OF THE FOREARM. ALTERIA PALMAR IS PROFUNDA. The description of this artery is shortly this : It is but a small artery; it comes off a little lower than the pisiform bone ; it often gives the last lateral artery of the little finger; it then turns downwards and back- wards with a large circle, passes through betwixt the two heads of the flexor digiti minimi; by th'S it gets into the deepest part of the palm, and there joins itself with that palmar branch of the radial artery which comes off at the root of the thumb; and by this inos- culation the deep palmar arch is completed. The ulnar artery having now arrived at the root of the metacarpal bones, forms a great arterial arch across the palm of the hand, which is named the superfi- cial palmar arch ; and this arch gives out the arteries for the fingers after the following order: It does not give off two arteries to each finger, one for each side, because it does not lie at the root of the fingers, but lower down: but instead of this it sends out three single arteries ; each of these goes to the deft betwixt two of the fingers; and when arrived at the roots of the fingers, these branches divide uni- formly and regularly into two branches; of which one goes up along the side of ohe finger, while the other goes up the opposite side of the next finger; and thus all the fingers are supplied each with two arteries, one running along either edge of each finger. To number them according to the fingers one, two, three, were mere drudgery, and waste of time; and to pame and describe them were an absolute abuse, since they

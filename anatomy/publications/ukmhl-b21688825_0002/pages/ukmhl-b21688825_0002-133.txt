OF THE ELOODc 31 which it could understand when it were within and when without the body; and whether in certain cir- cumstances it were lit that such vessels should be formed! That clots should have been busied form- ing vessels within them for ages, and no body ever have seen the process going on! That Mr. Hunter, who has been looking out for vascular clots for thirty years, never should have seen this phenomenon r is all very surprising. Mr. Hunter falls into a deeper blun- der in this business than in the affair of the frozen egg; he absolutely never saw a proper vascular clot. He informs us most deliberately in page 92, “ that he thinks he has been able to inject what he suspected to be the beginning of a vascular formation in a coagulum, when it could not derive any vessels from the surrounding parts.” From whence then did this clot derive its injection? this is a question which de- tects at once what Mr. Hunter was doing, and puts this experiment pretty much upon a footing with the frozen egg. To say “ that the blood, in some circumstances, unites living parts by a sort of contiguous sympathy as certainly as the yet recent branches of one tree unite it with another,” is to put forth a syllogism, in which both major and minor propositions are un- true. First, it is not true, that it is the juices of the tree which unite the graff to the stock; it is the li- ving fibres, and the living vessels of both; and unless both be alive, the process must fail, living juices would do no good. Secondly, though the juices did so unite or glue together the branches of a tree, that were no proof of the juices being alive; but only that good Vol. II. G juices,

OF THE ARTERIES OF THE 420 liver is smaller, and when there is an hepatic artery from the stomach it is very small; it mounts over the vena portae, and enters into the liver at the fossa um- biiicalis ; its branches within the liver go chiefly to the left lobe, lobulus spigelii, and anonymous lobe. HEPATICA DEXTRA. The right branch of the hepatic artery passes under the biliary ducts, enters along with them into the right lobe of the liver, and before it does so it gives off the arteria cystica, or artery of the gab-bladder, one of the most beautiful little arteries in the body. The cystic artery branches over the gall-bladder betwixt its coats, in the form of a coronary artery, and having made a beautiful tree of branches over the gall- bladder, it passes off from it, and goes to the substance of the liver. ARTERIA SPLENICA. _ . The splenic artery is one of the most remark- able in the human body. The spleen is tied down to the left side of the diaphragm by a proper ligament; it is also connected with the greater or bulging end of the stomach by processes of the omentum and by vessels. The splenic artery, the largest branch of the coeliac, as large as a goose-quill, turns off from the codiac trunk almost at right angles, and runs a foot in length across the abdomen to get to the spleen. It is in all this course exceedingly tortuous; it runs along the upper edge of the pancreas (which also lies across

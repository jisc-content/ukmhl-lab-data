36 Â£ OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 6. ARTERIA spinatus and teres major muscles, betwixt them and the bone ; and although the suprascapular artery from the shoulder supplies chiefly the upper part of the scapula, yet it is chiefly above the spine that that artery circulates, while the lower parts of the Infra- spinatus and the Teres minor muscles are left to be supplied by this reflected branch of the subscapular artery: thus this reflected branch gives its arteries, first to the Teres, then it enters into the hollow under the spine, and besides supplying the infra-spinatus and the bone itself, it also makes a circle, though a shorter one, and inosculates with the supra-scapularis, just as the other branch of this same artery does on its lower surface. This branch descends nearly to the corner of the scapula before it begins this inosculating circle ; but it sends also another chief branch round the neck of the scapula, which advancing towards the suprascapular notch, inosculates very largely with the suprascapular artery. Thus is the scapula encircled, and supplied with a wondeaful profusion of blood by two great arteries ; one,the suprascapular artery, coming across the neck, over the shoulder, and through the scapular notch; another, the subscapular artery, which comes from the axilla to the lower flat surface of the scapula, and divides at the edge of the scapula into two great branches ; one of which keeps still to the flat surface, while the other turns over the edge of the scapula, and supplies in part its upper or outer surface.

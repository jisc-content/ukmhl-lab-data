OF THE ARTERIES 444 named gluteus minimus, and gives innumerable great branches to the middle and lesser glutei muscles, and to the joint of the thigh-bone. The other great branch of the gluteal artery slips in betwixt the gluteus major and the gluteus medius ; and as it lies betwixt these two great muscles, it gives a prodigious number of branches to each, but chiefly to the great glut seal muscle. ARTERIA ISCHIADICA The sciatic artery is so named, because, instead of going upwards with this crooked turn towards the haunch, it goes obliquely downwards to the hip, in. the direction of the main artery from which it comes. It comes off from the iliac about an inch lower than the gluteal, and is next to it in size ; almost equal when (as it often happens) the pudic artery is derived from it. The glnteal artery should be contrasted with it thus: The gluteal goes out above the pyriform mus- cle; the sciatic goes out below it; the gluteal turns upwards over the haunch-bone, the sciatic turns downwards along the hip; the gluteal spreads its arteries wide with sudden and crooked angles; the sciatic sends its arteries downwards in a gentle waving form, or almost straight; and so numerous as to be compared with a lash of many thongs proceeding from one shaft. Often the gluteal artery, before it passes out of the pelvis, gives small twigs to the rectum, to the bone, and to the pyriform muscle; and in like manner the ischiadic, before it escapes frdm the pelvis, gives also trivial

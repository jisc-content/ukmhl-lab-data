349 OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. Upon the pleura, betwixt it and the ribs. The me- diastinum is just that doubling of the pleura which descends from the sternum to the spine, and of course many small arteries go down from the lower surface of the sternum along the pleura into the mediastinum, and by that to the pericardium, or even to the mem- brane of the lungs; for the pericardium is one inflec- tion of the pleura and mediastinum, and the covering membrane of the lungs is another. The mammary, as it goes downwards, sends branches through the interstices of the ribs; two twigs pass through each interstice, going to the inter- costal muscles, and to the muscles which lie upon the thorax, as the pectoral muscles; also to the mamma, to the obliquus externus abdominis, and to form loops of inosculations round the ribs with the proper inter- costal and thoracic arteries. These twigs pass through the interstices of the six or seven upper ribs, but at the seventh the artery itself comes out. They are too numerous and too small to be either counted or named. Seventh, The mammary, before it terminates in the two branches, of which one keeps the middle and goes to the rectus muscle, while the other goes out- wards to the oblique muscle; as already described, gives about the place of the sixth riba branch which, in place of passing out of the thorax, keeps to its inner surface, goes downwards along the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, makes its inosculations there with the intercostal and other arteries, and endsinthe side of the diaphragm, and in the transverse or innermost muscle of the abdomen, which indigitates, as we call it, with the

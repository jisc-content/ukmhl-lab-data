THE FOETUS. 18 5 one quality when it arrives at the auricle, in order to fill the heart, and to begin its course round the body. Now, since the blood is all of one quality, Nature could have no cause for dividing such blood into two portions; one to pass through the lungs, the other to pass over the body. She could have no motive for employing, as in the adult, two hearts. The design of Nature plainly is, to prepare a double heart, and keep it in reserve for the circulation of the adult, but to use it as a single heart in the foetus. And see how simply this is accomplished. The two auricles com- municate so freely by the foramen ovale, that they are as one: the two ventricles both deliver their blood into one vessel, the aorta; and they are also as one. The blood arrives by the cavas, fills the right auricle, and in the same moment fills, through the foramen ovale, the left auricle ; so that the auricles are as one, and filled by one stroke; the two auricles act at once, and so the ventricles also are filled by one stroke ; the aorta receives theblood of both ventricles at one stroke. So that, in the strictest sense of the word, the foetus has but one single heart, the heart of the body (the function of the lungs being performed by the pla- centa, far from its proper system ;) and when the function of its own lungs begins, then Nature, by the simplest of all mechanisms, divides the two hearts, that they may perform each its peculiar function. First, the flow of blood into the lungs deprives the ductus arteriusus of blood; and, secondly, this flow of blood coming round to the left auricle of the heart restores the balance, presses down the valve of the foramen ovale and makes the partition betwixt the auricles

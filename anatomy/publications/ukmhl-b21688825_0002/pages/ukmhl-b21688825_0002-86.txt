38 OP THE ACTION 0f the irritability and action of the heart. Bat even tbiscurious mechanism of the heart is not pnore wonderful than its incessant action, which is sup- ported by the continual influx ofstimulant blood and by its high irritability and muscular pow'er; for though we cannot directly trace the various courses of its muscular fibres, there is not in the human body any part in which, the muscular substance is so dense and strong. Jn the heart there can be no direct or straight fibres ; for let them go off from the basis ot the heart in what direction they may, still as they belong to the one or the other ventricle, they must, by following the course and shape of that ventricle, form an oblique line. Vasalius has indeed not represented them so, he has drawn straight fibres only; becausein the latter end of his great work he was without human subjects, and betook himself to drawing from beasts. The fibres of the heart are all oblique, or spiral, some lying almost transverse ; they all arise from a sort of tendinous line which unites the auricle to the ventricle; they wind spirally down the suriace till the fibres of the opposite ventricles meet in the septum and in the apex of the heart. The fibres of each ventricle pass over the convex or upper surface of the heart, then over the apex, and then ascend along the fiat side of the heart, which lies upon the diaphragm, till they again reach the basis of the heart. The second layer or stratum of fibres is also oblique; yet many of the fibres run alnost transversely, uniting the oblique fibres; but when we go down into the thick substance of the heart, we find its fibres all

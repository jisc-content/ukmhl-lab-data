259 OF THE CAROTID ARTERIES. and the surgeon is too late. But although tumours and aneurisms are rare, and through unwillingness and a well-grounded fear such patients are usually left to fake their fate ; yet there may happen cases in which it may be necessary to do so bold a thing as to tie this artery. Secondly, The connections of the carotid, as it rises along the neck, must determine our judgment, if ever any such case should occur. To stop the growth of an aneurism, to allow the extirpation of other tumours about the jaw, to save a patient from dreadful bleed- ings of the throat, or from the hemorrhagies of deep wounds, when, for example, a patient is stabbed in the neck, or a ball passes through the mouth and under the angle of the jaw; these may, in some unlucky moment, present themselves as motives for tying the trunk of this artery, when all its great branches are torn. But always the observation of Galen is to be remembered, that the nerves accompanying these arteries are liable to be tied together with them. Let us recollect how the carotid artery, jugular vein, and eighth pair of nerves, come out from the skull, for it is almost at one single point. The carotid artery enters by a hole in the petrous bone ; the jugular vein comes out by a larger hole in the same bone, the foramen lacerum; immediately behind it the eighth pair of nerves, or the par vagum, goes out through a division of the same foramen lacerum, separated from the vein only by a little cross slip of the dura mater j and so the carotid artery, jugular vein, and eighth pair, touch each other at the basis of the skull. Through the whole length of the neck they continue the con- S 2 nection

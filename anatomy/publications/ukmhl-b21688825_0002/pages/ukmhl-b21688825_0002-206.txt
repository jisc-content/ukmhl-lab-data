OF RESPIRATION. 1.50 so great an animal as the Crocodile are, when in- flated, very delicate and transparent, of a rose-colour or slight redâ€ž consisting of delica;e vesicles, and exactly like the Frog's iungs. The lungs of the Frog" are in shape like a fir cone, with the stalk of the cone on each s de fixed to the side of the heart. But these conical lungs of each side are dedicate, silvery, perfectly transparent, divided within into innume- m era file cells like a honeycomb; and these also are so extremeiy delicate, that though the outside membrane is as t:ans arent as a soap-b'ubble, the divisions can hardly be seen, except by inflating and drying the iungs, and then cutting them. The lungs of the Ask are still more beautiful, as a specimen of what are called membranous bangs; for the creature is very long in the body, its lure run down along all its sides; they are about the size of a common earth-worm or writ- ing quill; they end line a blind gut; they are of a Li T hire, exquisitely transparent, like the swim- mu ; elder of a fish. 1 rite nature of membranous lungs to oxyge- mv; _ut a very small quantity of blood ; they are in a.branous, only because there is not that vast pro- f sion of arteries, veins, and strong vesicles, which there is in the human lungs. The pulmonic artery and vein are always, in the membranous lungs, extreme- ly small in proportion to he vast system which they serve. There cannot be better examples of this fact thar these two drawings of a Frog and of a Newt: In the Fro6 is seen the small artery and vein spreading more suddenly over the lungs; in the Ask is seen the same artery and vein, running down more directly.

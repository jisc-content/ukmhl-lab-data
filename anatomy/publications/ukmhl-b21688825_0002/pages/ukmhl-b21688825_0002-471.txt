OF THE THORAX. 403 the aorta is lodged, and along with it lies the cesopha. gus, which runs downwards towards the stomach The thoracic duct, which is passing upwards to the sub* clavian vein, and the vena azygos, which returns the blood of the thorax, and brings it into the descending cava j these parts are all involved in cellular substance) and inclosed in this triangular space betwixt the two membranes. The aorta, as it goes thus downwards besides the spine, gives the following branches: First, As it lies immediately behind the root of the lungs, it gives small arteries which nourish the proper substance of the lungs, the bronchial arteries: Secondly, As it lies by the side of the oesophagus, it supplies it with small twigs, the oesophageal arteries : Thirdly, The aorta, as it moves downwards through the thorax, gives off a small and regular artery to the interstice of each rib as it passes it; and these are the intercostal arte* RIES. The bronchial arteries are always three, and some* times four, in number. Their office is not to contri- bute to the oxydation of the blood; that office be- longs peculiarly to the pulmonic artery, while the small bronchial arteries are for nourishing the proper substance of the lungs; for which end they attach themselves immediately to the trachea, and follow its branches, twisting round them through all the sub- stance of the lungs. 1.

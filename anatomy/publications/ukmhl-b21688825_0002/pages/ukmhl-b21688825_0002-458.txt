S9Q OF THE ARTERIES From these anastomosing branches which belong to all the three arteries, we now return to describe the general course of the three great arteries; and first of the radial. ARTBRIA RADIALIS. \ The radial artery is properly the first branch of the ulnar ; it goes off from it at a pretty obtuse angle in the bend of the arm ; it passes under the pronator muscle, emerges from under it above the middle of the arm, follows the long tendon of the supinator, and runs under it down to the root of the thumb ; it is at the root of the thumb only that it divides into its great branches: and a clear proof that in its course down the forearm it gives offâ€™ none but small and ir- regular muscular branches, is this, that it preserves almost an equal diameter in all its progress from the elbow to the wrist. This is the artery which lies naked upon the radius at the wrist, where we feel the pulse. It lies more su- perficial, less imbedded in muscles, than the ulnar ar- tery ; for six inches above the wrist there is to be felt nothing but the naked artery, the sharp tendon of the supinator, and the bone. The radial artery, as to its course down towards the wrist, is direct; but with regard to itself, it is tortuous, with short and gentle wavings. Of its branches, as it moves down the fore- arm, there is not one that is worthy to be named. First it gives a branch to the supinator, and to the ex- tensors of the carpus; then it gives the radial recur- rent, already described ; then having gone a little deeper among the muscles, it repeats its branches to the

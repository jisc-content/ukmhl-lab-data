THE FOETUS* 177 VOL. II. N parts*. 'Next, we observe in the foetus how the um- bilical vein runs into the left branch of the vena por- tae, insomuch, that the left branch of the portae has not any determined form ; nor has the sinus venae portae, or the horizontal shaft of this vein, that peculiar and formal shape which I have already observed. 1 his shape, then, of the sinus venae portae, is not to be looked for in the child, and is not found in these plans. Again, we find in the adult those blood-vessels ob- literated which served such peculiar uses in the foetus 5 the blood which flowed formerly into all the left side of the liver by the umbilical vein now comes along the venae portae; these veins are now working their blood forwards in a retrograde course; the blood which flowed^once in the direction (/) N° 2. runs now in the direction [k) N° 3. In this plan are seen also the hepatic veins, or branches of the vena cava, in the liver. These three great veins marked (/ / /)—are the returning veins, which carry back to the heart that blood which the venae portae (assuming the office of an artery) circu- lates in the liver ; and it is with one of these that the ductus venosus joins before it enters the heart. * One is forced to speak this unphilosophical language, though the size of the liver in the foetus is as just and well proportioned to the foetus, as that of ail adult body is to an adult body. forameh

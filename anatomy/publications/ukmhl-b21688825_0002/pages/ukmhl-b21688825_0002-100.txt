The pericardium is formed like the pleura and mediastinum, of the cellular sub- stance; it is rough and irregular without, and fleecy with the threads of cellular substance, by which it is connected with all the surrounding parts; within it is smooth, white, tendinous, and glistening, and ex- ceedingly strong. As the heart lies upon the floor of the diaphragm, the pericardium, which lies under the heart, is connected with the diaphragm a little to the left of its tendinous centre, and so very strongly that they are absolutely inseparable. The pericardium surrounds the whole heart, but it is loose every where except at the root of the heart, where it is connected with the great vessels: For the pericardium is not fixed into the heart itself, but rises a considerable way upon the great vessels, gives them an outward coat, and surrounds each vessel with a sort of ring, as may be seen in the plan*. For, 1st, It surrounds the pul- monic veins where they are entering the heart; there the pericardium is short: 2ndly, It mounts higher upon the vena cava than upon any other vessel; the cava of course is longer within the pericardium, and it also is surrounded with a sort of ring: 3dly, It then passes round the aorta andpulmonic artery, surrounding these in one greater loop: 4thly, The cava inferior is the vessel which is the shortest within the pericardium: for the heart inclines towards the horizontal direction; it lies in a manner flat upon the upper surface of the dia- phragm, while the lower surface of the diaphragm ad- heres to the upper surface of the liver. Thus it happens that the liver and the right auricleofthe heart are almost * Vide Plan, NÂ° 18. in /

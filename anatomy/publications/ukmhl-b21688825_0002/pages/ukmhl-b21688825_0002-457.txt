OF THE FOREARM. with the anastomoticus major over the forepart of the inner condyle. In a preparation which 1 have, it is the posterior artery which runs tortous and enlarged behind the inner condyle: but I must add to the au- thenticity of this preparation, by noticing, that I have several times felt distinctly, after successful operations for the aneurism, that it was this posterior artery that was enlarged. RECURRENS INTEROSSEA. The recurrent of the interosseous artery is the first of its branches, though sometimes this recur- rent rises from the ulnar a little above the interosseous. This artery going to the middle and back part of the joint is very constant; it first sends one smaller branch forwards towards the root of the brachialis internus muscle, which inosculates over the forepart of the joint with the ramus anastomoticus magnus, and with the ulnar and radial recurrents; but these inoscula*â€™ tions and this anterior branch are of small importance. The chief branch goes through that lacerated-like hole which is in the upper end of the interosseous ligament; and the artery having passed through this hole, and got to the back of the joint, it runs for two inches upwards along the back of the olecranon, con- tributing greatly to form, by its inosculations with both branches of the profunda superior, that net-work of ar- teries which covers all the backpart of the joint, and which belongs chiefly to the joint, to the capsule, and *o the bones which form the joint.

$199 OF THE BRAIN, one of their coats, and that of course the arteries of the brain are peculiarly weak. That the arteries of the brain want that outward coat of cellular substance which all arteries passing through other cavities or along the limbs have, is no doubt true, and so far they are thinner: but how much they are weakened by this loss, it is not easy to say; for they want none of the coats which are essential to tire constitution of an artery; and this cellular coat, though it constitutes much of the thickness of an artery, has, I believe, but little to do with its strength. Yet true it is, that the arteries of the brain, either from being weaker in themselves, being less supported, lying upon the soft and pulpy substance of the brain, are more frequently burst by falls, or even by the slightest accidents, than the arteries of any other part, even the limbs, how- ever much exposed. Our injections burst them very often ; the slightest blow or fall upon the head often produces an internal effusion of blood, which occasions death; but that the arteries of the brain are so delicate as to be burst by a false step, so as to produce a fatal aneurism within the brain, is a truth perhaps not commonly known. A young woman, carrying in her arms her first child, about six months old, slipped her foot with a slight shock ; but it was on plain and even ground, and she did not fall down. In the instant of this shock she was sensible of a sudden pain in the right side of her head: it was so peculiar, that she said she could cover the point with her finger; and though slighter at intervals, this pain never left her to the moment of her death. She walked home, went about her

ARTERIES OF THE EYE. $so ophthalmic there generally arise two muscular arte- ries ; the one for the upper, the other fbr the lower muscles. 1. ARTERIA MUSCULARIS SUPERIOR, The upper muscular artery consists of small twigs, which go chiefly to the levator palpebrse and rectus superior; and these, though they sometimes arise as two small twigs from the ophthalmic artery itself, yet in general come off rather from that artery which, as it goes out by the supra-orbitary hole, is named the supra-orbitary artery. These muscular branches of the supra-orbitary, then, supply the upper muscles of the eye, as the levator palpebrse, the obliquus major, the rectus superior, and the sclerotic or outer coat of the eye. 2. ARTERIA MUSCULARIS INFERIOR. The lower muscular artery is very generally an independent artery, and pretty large. It comes off from that part of the ophthalmic artery where it is giving off the ciliary arteries. This muscular branch is large enough to give off sometimes the arteria centralis retinae, and often some of the short ciliary arteries arise from it; it is so long as even to reach the lower eyelid. The muscles which it supplies are all those which lie on the lower part of the eye, as the deprimens oculi, abducens oculi, obliquus minor. It also gives variable twigs to the sclerotica, the optic

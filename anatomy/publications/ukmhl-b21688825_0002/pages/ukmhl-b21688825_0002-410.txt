344 ARTERIES OP THE ARM. limb be the smallest danger from this much dreaded obstruction of the blood The arteries of the forearm are more interesting still; * or if we will be so selfish as to consider the dif- ficulties of the surgeon merely, wounds of the arteries in the forearm are very distressing. These arteries lie deep among the muscles, drive their blood (when wounded ; through the whole arm, and either occasion a difficult and most painful dissection, or cause a deep and gangrenous suppuration ; so that whether the surgeon be so dexterous as to secure the arteries, or so timid as to leave the arm in this woeful condition, the patient js to undergo such sufferings by pain, or by a long disease, as must interest us greatly. The arteries even of the wrist and hand, though small, are important. The difficulty of managing wounds of these arteries stands but too often recorded in all kinds of books for us to doubt the fact. If many have died after frequent bleedings from these arteries, though under skilful hands, what ought we not to submit to in the way of study and labour to acquire and to retain a knowledge of these arteries ; since by that alone every thing that is surgical in tumours, aneurisms, amputations, is well or ill per- formed according to our degree of knowledge; and since, according to our degree of knowledge, we are disengaged in our minds, and have free possession of our judgment, to do any thing which may be re- quired ? In short, as we proceed along this artery, we shall perceive that each division of it rises in import- ance 5 or at least, that if wounds about the axilla be more dangerous, they are proportionably rare; that if

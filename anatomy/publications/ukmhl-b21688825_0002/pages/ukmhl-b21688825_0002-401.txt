S35 ARTERIES OF THE EYE. the most remarkable branch of this artery, from which indeed it has its name, runs down upon the side of the nose, making a beautiful net-work, and inosculating with the last branch of the labial artery which runs up to meet it*. This is quite a cutaneous artery; many of its twigs go to the skin; it is felt beating strongly; it was often opened when arteriotomy was snore regarded than it is now. 4. arteria frontalis. The frontal artery is now to be distinguished from the supra-orbital; for the supra-orbital rises deep in the socket, emerges by the supra-orbitary hole, passes along chiefly betwixt the bone and muscles, and makes no remarkable figure upon the face; while this, the frontal artery, is larger, keeps chiefly upon the surface of the muscles, is quite subcutaneous, has nothing to do with the supra-orbitary hole, and rises beautifully upon the forehead. It is a delicate and slender artery, not so large as the nasal, and looks like one of its branches; it gives off first a branch to the eyelids, named superciliary artery, which sup- plies the root of the frontal and the upper part of the orbicularis muscles; it sends an ascending branch which dives under the frontal muscle, and belongs chiefly to the os frontis and pericranium. This is * Some of its branches absolutely penetrate the cartilages of the nose, and so get access to the Schneiderian membrane, and supply it with blood.

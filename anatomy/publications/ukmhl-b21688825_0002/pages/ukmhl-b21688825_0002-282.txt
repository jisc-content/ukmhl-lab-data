MALCONFORMATION OF 218 been; there was no branch of the trachea for the right lobe intended by Nature, but both the legs of the trachea plunged into the left lung, which was large: There was no forking of the pulmonary artery to give a branch to the right side, but the whole trunk of the pulmonic artery plunged into the left lung. But if one should suspect that there might have been once a right branch, the lungs destroyed, and the mouths curiously united by that mucus which the membranes of the viscera, and the pleura especially, throw out when inflamed; there are still other cases which must remove all our doubts, especially that of a young man*, who died in a very lingering way, and in whom before his death there was plainly per- ceived, along with his slight anxieties, a pulsation in the right side of the breast. Upon opening his body, there was found in the left side neither lungs nor heart; nor, upon the most careful examination (seeking for the wasted lung), could there be found the smallest remains of lungs, bronchite, pulmonic arteries, or the slightest evidence that any such parts had ever been. But the surest proof of this remains behind, for the heart stood in the right side of the chest; it stood per- pendicularly, quite upright like a Dogâ€™s; it gave out a right pulmonic artery, but there was not even the smallest vestige of any artery having been appointed for the left lobe. We must not say, yet his chest may have been full enough of lungs and heart, and he may have had a well-oxydated blood; in which case it was * Under the care of Dr. Heberden. Vid.

OF THE ARTERIES 442 ARTERIA These, then, are the chief arteries of the rectum, bladder, womb, vesiculas seminales, and other parts within the pelvis. ORDER SECOND. OF] THE ARTERIES WHICH GO OUT FROM THE PELVIS TO THE HAUNCHES, HIPS, AND PRIVATE PARTS. In this second class or order there are just four great arteries; one which goes over the back of the haunch-bone to the glutseal muscle, named GIu- taeal artery; one going downwards over the tuber is- chii to the hip, named the Ischiadic artery; one which goes out of the pelvis, returns into it again, and passes out a second time by the root of the penis, named the Pudic artery; and one which passes out through the thyroid hole into the deep muscles at the top of the thigh, named Thyroid artery. All these larger arteries go off from the convex of that arch which the hypogastric forms, and move backwards and downwards, in order to escape from the pelvis, either by the sciatic notch or below. Let it be remembered, that the iliac artery forks just at the meeting of the ilium and sacrum ; that the great sacro-sciatic notch is formed by this joining of the ilium and sacrum, and is just under the junction of these two bones: that the glutasal artery passes out by this sacro-sciatic hole; and that of course it is the first, as well as the greatest, of those three arteries which turn backwards out of the pelvis.

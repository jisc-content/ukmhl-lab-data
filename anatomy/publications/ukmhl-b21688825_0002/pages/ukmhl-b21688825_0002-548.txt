OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 476 artery, which is itself very short and thick, sends out its slender inosculating branches: one goes downwards along the tendon of the great triceps; and when the tendon of that muscle stops above the inner condyle, this artery goes forwards over the condyle, makes a net-work upon it, joining in numberless inosculations with the articular arteries from below, and gives twigs also into the joint. The other branches of this ramus anastomoticus tend all forwards and upwards to join the descending branches of the reftexa externa, which come down along the rectus muscle. There are two other arteries lying close upon the joint, remarkable enough to deserve a name, and they are called perforating arteries; not perforating like the branches of the profunda, to get deeper among the flesh; but perforating so as to get out from the cavity of the ham upon the surface of the thigh again. The upper perforating artery arises from the inner side of the popliteal artery, just after it has per- forated the triceps; but it must not be accounted a popliteal branch, because it immediately perforates the triceps muscle again. It gives branches to the semi- tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and sartorius; in short, it turns it branches towards the muscles on the inner side of the knee, and is a smaller astery. The lower or second perforating artert goes off nearly opposite to this. It is a much larger artery. In order to escape from the ham, it perforates the shorter head of the biceps, or outer hamstring muscles. It first crosses the ham at its very upper point, and within the substance of the triceps; it then per- forates

OF THE ARTERIES 436 forwards into the thigh; the other, the internal iliac, which dives immediately down into the pelvis to sup- ply the internal parts; and this is the artery which must be first described. ARTERIA SACRA MEDIA. This bifurcation of the aorta gives off just one ar~ tery, which proceeds exactly from the fork; and being in the middle, it is a single or azygous artery, which has not a fellow. It is small, long, very regular, and passes down so correctly in the middle of the bone, that it is named the middle sacral artery. It is about the size of a crow-quill; passes directly over the middle of that projecting point which is named the promontory of the sacrum; it descends expressly in the middle of the bone, quite to the point of the os coccygis. At the place of each vertebra (for the sacrum consists of vertebrae now united toge- ther), it gives off cross branches, which go across the body of the sacrum to inosculate with the lateral sa- cral arteries. Besides these, it gives arteries to the substance of the bone, and not unfrequently small ar- teries to the rectum. This artery ends near the point of the os coccygis in a forked or double inosculation with the lateral sacral arteries of each side. ILIACA interna. The internal iliac artery is of vast size; it not only supplies all the parts within the pelvis, but sends out by the several openings of the pelvis those great arteries which supply both the private parts, and the immense mass of muscle which surrounds the haunch.

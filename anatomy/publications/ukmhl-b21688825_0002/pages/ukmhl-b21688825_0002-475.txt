OP THE THORAX. 407 nerve backwards, enters into the substance of the spi- nal marrow itself. 2. Each intercostal gives next a larger artery, which perforates near the head of each rib, and passes through to the back, and supplies the longissimus dorsi, latissimus dorsi, sacro-lumbalii, and all the great mus- cles of the back, which have indeed no other source whence they can derive arteries; and though these are apparently small for so great a mass of mus- cular flesh, that smallness is compensated for by their frequency. 3. The intercostal artery proceeds, after giving these branches, along its proper intercostal space5 where it gives an immense number of small arteries to the intercostal muscles; and as each artery passes round the thorax along the ribs, it splits into two branches; one attaches itself to the lower edge of the rib above it, where there is a sort of groove to re- ceive it, that is, the larger artery, and the artery which is to be feared in wounds or operations; the other at- taches itself to the upper sharp edge of the lower rib, where there is no groove ; this of course is the smaller branch, much less important in all respects. These two accompanying each rib, run round the circle of the thorax to its forepart, and inosculate with the mammary and epigastric arteries. D d 4 ยง 2. AR-

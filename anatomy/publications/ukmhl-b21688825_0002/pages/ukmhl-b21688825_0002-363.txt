■OF THE TRAIN. 297 particularly in the carotid canal where the artery passes through the bone. If it continue from dis- ease, or if we persist in our exertions, giddiness, blindness, ringing of the ears, come on. Haller reT members, that while he was laying in a bad fever, he suffered so much from the pulsations of the carotid artery within the skull, that his head was lifted from his pillow at every stroke, I wish he had said, “ seemed to be lifted from his pillow at every stroke for it was rather a sickly feeling than what could actually happen. Did this vast column of blood rush directly into the brain, we do not know what might be its effects ; but surely they could not be harmless, since Nature has provided against it in Man, and in the lower animals which hang their heads, with a peculiar care. In Man, this blood is retarded chiefly by the tortuous course which the artery is obliged to follow, and by that long bony canal which, by holding the carotid as in a sheath, must suppress its violent action, and at least prevent its being dilated by force of the blood, when, as often happens, the lower part of the artery Is more full and tense. Perhaps also it may have some effect, that the carotid, as it lies by the side of the sella tur- cica, is not naked and free, but is inclosed in a venous sinus, which consists of cells like those of the male penis, and in the heart of which the carotid lies bathed in the blood. It is also peculiar in all the arteries of the brain, that they do not enter in trunks into its substance. This seems to be a violence which the soft texture of the brain could not bear -} but all the arteries having perforated the

OF RESPIRATION. 162 round tlie intestines and stomach of a Worm; and it is not to be forgotten, that though the beginnings of these tubes in their great tracheas and near the punc- ta respiratoria are qu'te transparent, their extreme branches are beautifully white like vessels filled with chyle, or rather one might be apt to mistake them for Of the way in which this function is performed, there must be more varieties than we can know or com- prehend: this we may safely conclude from the little that we do know, finding the variety so very great. Almost all insects have their puncta, like those of the Caterpillar, ranged along the side, and inoscula- ting like those of the Louse from branch to branch: often the puncta open along the sides; but in place of inosculating from branch to branch, all round one side, they inosculate across the belly, the one side com- municating with the other. This is best observed in the small Worm from which the Bee proceeds (vide Fig. 6.),, which is a magnified drawing of the Bee- Nvcrm. And here it must be observed, that, as in other insects, always the stigmata or breathing points cor- respond neatly with the folds or rings while it con- tinues a Worm, and with the scales or divisions of the body when itP becomes a Fly; in the Bee-worm the inosculations answer to the flexures or joints of the body.

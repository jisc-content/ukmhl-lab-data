478 OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY. any importance; none but trivial ones to the ham- strings or to the heads of the gastrocnemii. In its whole length from the place of its perforating the tri- ceps tendon to its great division, which is under the longer head of the solaeus muscle, it gives none but articular arteries, i. e. small arteries to the knee-joint, which are no less than five in number, and encircle it in all directions. First, The popliteal artery sends off from each side two muscular branches, not deserving a particular name nor description; the one goes to the biceps or muscle of the outer hamstring, the other to the semi- tendinosus and sartorius, or inner hamstring muscles. Then come off the arteries of the joint, which are thus arranged: 1. The upper arteries coming off above the joint are three in number; one turning round the inner side of the joint, and one round the outer side, and one in the middle; whence it is named azygous, as having no fellow. 2. The arteries below the joint are two only in number; one to the inner side, and one to the outer side, of the joint; and these directions of the arteries settle both the order of de- scription and also their names. ARTERIA ARTICULARIS SUPERIOR EXTERNA. That upper articular artery which comes off above the knee, and which turns round the outer side of the joint, arises from the popliteal artery above the outer condyle; its trunk is like all these arteries about the joints, short and stumpy; but its branches long and slender. It passes under the flesh of the, biceps; it

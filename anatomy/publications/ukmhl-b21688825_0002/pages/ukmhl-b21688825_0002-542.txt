470 OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. bone, to the quadratus femoris. It is this artery which gives most of those branches about the roots of the trochanters named trochanteric arteries ; and it is from this artery that many branches go backwards along the tuber ischii, to unite with those of the sciatic and pudic arteries. OF THE PERFORATING ARTERIES. The two first perforating arteries are very large; the two next perforating are smaller and less regu- lar ; the fifth perforating artery is just the termi- nation of the profunda. But still it must be under- stood, that these perforating arteries are extremely ir- regular in place, size, and number, as indeed all mus- cular arteries must be ; and that there are, besides the greater perforating arteries, many like them in this part of the thigh, though not distinguished by name. ARTERIA PERFORANS PRIMA. The first perforating artery is the largest branch of the profunda, bigger than both the articu- lar arteries joined. It arises from the profunda, just under the lesser trochanter, betwixt the pectinalis and triceps brevis ; and perforates the triceps about an inch below the trochanter, and close upon the thigh- bone. Here the artery lies under the lower edge of the glutaeus, and close by the origin of the biceps, semi-tendinosus and seml-membranosus muscles, the three muscles which form the hamstrings; and the chief division of the artery is into one great branch, going upwards along the glutaeus, and another going downwards

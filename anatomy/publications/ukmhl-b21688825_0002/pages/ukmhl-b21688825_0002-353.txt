OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 289 anterior arteries of the ear, and which play all round the fore part of the ear. The temporal artery having now emerged from the parotid gland, and from the thick fascia which covers it, makes a sudden serpentine turn before the ear; and then rising about half an inch perpendicularly, it forks with a pretty wide angle into two arteries, which are named the anterior and posterior temporal arteries. These lie quite superficial under the skin, above the fascia, and are distributed in this manner: First the anterior temporal artery goes directly forwards to the naked part of the temple, runs up the side of the forehead with a very serpentine course ; it is here that in old men we see its contortions and pulsation very distinctly ; it goes round arching forwards and upwards from the temple towards the top of the head. It belongs chiefly to the skin and frontal muscle, and that tendinous kind of sheath which covers the cra- nium; it gives some branches to the orbicular and corrugator muscles; it forms often a superciliary arch with the proper frontal artery; it often sends off a branch very early towards the outer corner of the eye, which is entirely destined for the orbicularis oculi. ' The POSTERIOR TEMPORAL ARTERY is the last branch of all. It arches backwards over the top of the ear; it turn thus backwards till it meets the branches of the occipital artery; it deals its branches from either side upwards and downwards, i, e. towards the ear, and towards the top of the head in great profusion, till it is quite exhausted. These branches belong to the skin chiefly and to the pericranium; \ ol. II. I1 and

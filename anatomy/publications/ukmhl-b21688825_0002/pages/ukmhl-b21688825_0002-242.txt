I 378 FORAMEN OVALE. % The foremen ovale, the second peculiarity of the foetus, is a hole of no inconsiderable size, transmit- ting the blood freely from the right to the left side of the heart. Its use is obvious, even from a general view of the system ; and when we look more closely into its mechanism, its uses are completely explained. Its valve being placed on the side of the left auricle, perfectly settles (and that by the only authentic proof) the course of its blood: and, satisfied with the de- scription which I am now to give, I decline all dis- Explanation of the Plan of the Foramen Ovale. (a) The ascending cava, with its hepatic branches (b b)—» (c) The descending cava.— (d) The right auricle, where it lies against the roots of the aorta and of the pulmonic artery—(») The isthmu* Veussenii, as it is called, or circle which surrounds the oval hole— (ot) The valve of the foramen ovale—(n) A small opening, which we always find towards its upper part—(o) The opening towards the ventricle.—This plan is intended chiefly for showing the true place of the foramen ovale; its anatomy and just form is better re- presented in the true drawing which ends this subject.

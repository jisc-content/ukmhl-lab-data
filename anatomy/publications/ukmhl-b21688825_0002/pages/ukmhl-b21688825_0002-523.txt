451 OF THE PELVIS. and there is always a branch, which encircles the up- per part of the foramen thyroideum, lies close upon the bone,'and gives its twigs upwards into the muscles of the belly. After the artery has passed along with its nerve through the thyroid hole, it comes into the very heart or central part of the thigh. Almost all its branches are muscular; none are worth distinguishing by name; it is only the general tendency of the artery that needs to be explained. It divides into two chief branches., taking opposite directions. The first is deeper; it turns downwards and outwards towards the hip-joint. It performs three services here; it gives first arteries to the periosteum, to the capsule, and to the gland within the acetabulum; it gives also large branches to the obturator quadratus femoris, and ali the great muscles which immediately surround the joint; it also forms very large and important anastomoses round the joint, with the sciatic and pudic arteries from the pelvis, and with the reflected arteries from the thigh. The more superficial branch of the thyroid sends all its branches into the great muscles upon the inner side of the thigh coming from the pubis. Its chief brancnes are to the upper part of the triceps muscle; it sometimes gives branches even to the superficial mus- cles, as the gracilis and sartorius; always, at least small twigs pass through these muscles to the skin of the thigh and to the scrotum. Of these two arteries, this superficial one encircles the inner edge of the thyroid hole, or that which is next the pubis, with one of its branches; while the deeper artery encircles G g 2 the

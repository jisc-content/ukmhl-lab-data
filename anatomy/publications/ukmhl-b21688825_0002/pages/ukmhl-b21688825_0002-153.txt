101 OF THE BLOOD. 1 have said, “ that the blood is a fluid of a r.ch and beautiful colour ; vermilion coloured in the arteries, strong purple in the veins, and black, or almost so, at the right side of the heart.” When we open the tho- rax of a living Dog, the lungs collapse, the heart soon ceases to play, the Dog languishes, expires, is revived again when we blow up its lungs:—then begins again the motion of the heart, the black blood of the right auricle is driven into the lungs; the blood goes round to the left side of the heart of a florid red; and this purple biood of the veins, the vermilion blood of the arteries, the change happening so plainly from ac- cess of air, is a phenomenon of the most interesting nature, and binds us to look into the doctrines of chemistry for the solution of a phenomenon to which there is in all the animal economy nothing equal. It is the study of air and aerial fluids that has brought to light all the beautiful discoveries of which modern chemistry can boast. The simplicity of the facts in chemistry, the correctness of the reasoning, the grandeur which now the whole science assumes, is very pleasing; and makes us not without hope, that by this science, all others, and ours in an especial manner, may be improved ; for the action of vessels will do much in forming and changing our fluids: all the rest is chemistry alone. The older bhemists were coarse in their methods, bold in their conjectures, in theory easily satisfied with anything which others would receive. They conde- scended to repeat incessantly the same unvarying pro- cess over each article of the materia medica; and II 3 among

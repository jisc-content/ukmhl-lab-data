394 OP THE ARTERIES ARTERIA immediately after, the dorsalis carpi. When there are two, they run both along the back of the thumb, one on one side, the other on the opposite side; that which runs along the outer edge of the thumb passes through under the tendons, and is rather shorter: that which inclines to the inner side of the thumb is rather longer. These small arteries on the back inosculate round the edges of the thumb with the great artery on the inner side; which is next to be described. The radial artery having advanced to the wrist, turns quick round the wrist, over the head of the ra- dius, and under the tendons of the thumb; it gives immediately before it passes the artery of the palm; it gives immediately after it passes the artery of the back of the hand ; it gives immediately after that the little arteries for the back of the thumb; it then mounts along the thumb in that hollow which is by the side of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, till it arrives at the cleft betwixt the thumb and forefinger. There it divides into three great arteries; one to the inner side of the thumb, very large another to that side of the forefinger which is next the thumb, which branch is much smaller ; and one which exceeds these in importance, for it dives down into the palm of the hand, forms what is called the deep arch of the palm; and which, having, crossed the palm, forms on the side next the middle finger that inosculation be- twixt the upper and lower arches which is so much celebrated.

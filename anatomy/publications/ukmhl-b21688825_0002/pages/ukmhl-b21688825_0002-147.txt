OF THE BLOOD, 9£ dissolved even to its centre; it becomes soft and flexible, still retains the form of a bone; but what re- mains is merely coagulable lymph. And though Four- croy is certainly right in saying the coagulable lymph is that part upon which nature fixes irritability or the contractile power, he should have added, “ but this gluten is moreover in the animal body the basis of every part which possesses life ;” it constitutes, in truth, no less than nine tenths of the solids of the whole body. The membranes, ligaments, tendons, periosteums, and all the white parts of the animal body, consist entirely of this ; and it is the business of cookery to boil them down into this jelly. It is this fibrous part, then, which is secreted by the vessels for repairing all the wastes and all the accidents of the body ; when a muscle is wasted by violent action, or by fevers, or by long confinement is absorbed, glu- ten is secreted to fill it up; when a bone is broken, much of this jelly is deposited in a bed for vessels to stretch into, and a new bone is quickly formed; when soft parts are cut, gluten is poured out betwixt them; when viscera are inflamed, pure gluten, white, and membranaceous-like, is poured out betwixt them; when the uterus is to be prepared for receiving the impregnated ovum, gluten is poured out into the womb; and in all these cases it is the foundation of a union with the surrounding parts. In short, this gluten forms, nourishes, supports, restores the parts of the animal body; but far from considering it either simply, or along with red globules, as containing the principle of life, I find it as perfect in dead vegetables as

But let us notice that the aorta was extremely small; the diameter of the aorta is the true measure of the blood which is received from the lungs. Where the aorta is small, surely the lungs are not good, nor the system fully supplied with oxydated blood. We also know that though the vessels of the lungs themselves may be natural and well arranged, the lungs may stili be amiss; they may want the proper structure of cells in which the blood should be ex- posed ; they may be encumbered with tumours arising out of their substance, by which th°y will be prevented from dilating. One is pleased to find in old authors good descriptions of diseases which have remained for ages unknown ; and among these I reckon that of the celebrated Spindler, whose description 1 admire as much as that of any succeeding author. The child of a certain prince having died after a few days of great suffering, Spindler opened the body, and found all sound and right, except that there were seated upon the two lungs two tubercles of a variegated red colour, as were the lungs themselves ; which tumours, no doubt, hindered the passage of the blood, which he expresses with a correctness in respect of physiology quite unknown in those times. cC Quae vomicae procul dubio hujus asphyxiae causae extitere denegata circulatione ex dextro in sinistrum cordis ventriculum.” His description of the disease so long before it was properly understood is curious : “ Du- ring the eight days in which the child lived, it had never

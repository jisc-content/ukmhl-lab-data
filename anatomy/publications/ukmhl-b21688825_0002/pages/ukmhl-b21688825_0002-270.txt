Malconformation of 206 ventricle, and artery, are first seen at a distance froni each other, and then joined*. In this conformation of the heart, the single heart appears again in a new form, and the office of the right or pulmonic side of the heart is well nigh annihi- lated. First, The pulmonic artery is small, sometimes almost close : Secondly, The aorta, arising as well from the right as from the left ventricle, carries off one half of that blood which should be circulated through the lungs: And, lastly. That blood, small as it is in quantity, which has passed through the lungs, is brought round to the left side of the heart; but the left side is not as it should be, close, to keep this purer blood for the circulation of the body, but it is mixed with the blood of the right side, through the perfo- rated septum, so that its virtues, as oxydated blood, are diluted or almost lost. If the pulmonic artery wer<Â£* unaffected, and the aorta placed equally over both' ventricles, then the one half exactly of that blood which should be oxy- dated would undergo the change. But in all these inalconformations, the root of the pulmonic artery also is in fault; it is narrow; it is so small, that at first opening such a body it alone attracts the eye; its * I do not mean to argue, that when we first see them, they are so little connected, that one could be awkwardly joined to the other, nor that they have no real connection, because it appears as if they had not; but merely this, that as they seem, like the parts of the eye, to be organized in separate pieces, I should sooner expect an unnatural displacement of the vessels of the heart thasi in the iniddfe of the fejnoral artery. mouth

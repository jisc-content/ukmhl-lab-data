THE FOETUS. 383 DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS. The ductus arteriosus I have defined a great inos* culation betwixt the pulmonic artery and the aorta; not for the purpose of conveying away that blood which should pass through the lungs, but for giving to the blood of the aorta the propelling power of both ventricles: andhowwell it is able to perform this office will be easily seen from the drawing on my marginf. The pulmonic artery of the adult divides, as has been marked in all myformerplans intotwo great arteries, one going to the right side, another to the left; but in the foetus there arises a mid- dlebranch betwixt these two. It is larger than both put together; it is in the middle, and so eomes most directly from the heart; it goes in a valves which guard the right auricle ; and both this and the valve of the foramen ovale appears, so bright against the blackness of the heart, because they are transparent, and the light is made to shine through them, which is the best way of demonstrating the valve of the foramen ovale. f This sketch is taken from a little preparation made on purpose, where a quill was thrust in so strongly bewixt the ductus arteriosus and aorta, as to separate them unnaturally, and leave a space («) be- twixt them.—(bb) Marks the two ventricles—>(cc) the place from . -'N 4 which

34 OF THE MECHANISM tricle, and from these directly into the aorta and ca- rotids ; while the foul blood of the upper cava went down into the right auricle and ventricle, and from that into the ductus arteriosus, and so away down to the lower and less noble parts of the body, and to the umbilical arteries, and so out of the system; for the ductus arteriosus, which comes from the right ventricle in the foetus, joins the aorta only as it goes down the back, and none of its blood can pass upwards into the head. This is the puerile theory, which, modified in various ways, has amused the French Academy, or rather been the cause of a perpetual civil war in it, for a hundred years. This doctrine began with Winslow, it is still acknowledged by Sabbatier; and Haller, after announcing a theory not at all differing from this, challenges it as his own theory; “ hanc meam con- jecturam etiam a Nichols video proponi.” Of the truth of this theory Haller was so entirely satisfied, that he not only published it as peculiarly his own, but reclaimed it when he thought it in danger of being thus appropriated by another. Sabbatier is the last in this train of authors; and in order that there might remain no ambiguity in what they had said or meant, he pronounces plainly that the Eustachian valve is use- ful only in the foetus, and that there are two opposite currents in the right auricle of the heart ; that the one goes from the lower cava upwards to the foramen ovale, while the other from the upper cava descends right into the opening of the ventricle. What shall we say to anatomists who in the narrow circle of the auricle conceive two currents to cross each other directly.? 4 J

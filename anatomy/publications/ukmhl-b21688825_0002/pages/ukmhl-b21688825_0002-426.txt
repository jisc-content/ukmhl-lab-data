OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. S60 as to ^he scaleni, and to the great nerves which He over ie artery, and to the serrated muscle, where it lies under the scapula: but these branches are so small that it is unnecessary either to number or describe them. The thoracic or external mammary arteries are the first important branches; they are four in number, and they are named after their place or office. 1. ARTERIA THORACIC A SUPERIOR. The upper thoracic artery, being the first, lies of course deep in the axilla. It comes off about the place of the first or second rib ; it lies bet\yixt the. lesser pectoral and the great serrated muscles; it gives its chief branches to these muscles, and it also gives, other branches to the intercostal muscles and the spaces betwixt the ribs. But, upon the whole, it lies very deep, is small, is so short that the next is entitled thora- cica longior; it is an artery of little note. 2. ARTERIA THORACICA LONGIOR. The long thoracic artery is more important, supplying all the great pectoral muscles and the mamma. It was named the external mammary artery; but we are the more willing to change the name, since it has no likeness to the internal mammary artery; is in no respect a counter-part to it; it might be named the pectoral artery. It is long, not tortuous, but straight and slender, and about the size of a crow-quill. It is needless to describe an artery so variable in its branches

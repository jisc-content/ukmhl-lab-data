Â£>F THE INTESTINES. 427 downwards along the ilium, and inosculates with the common branches of the mesenteric artery. It is from these two branches, which diverge like the rest of the colic arteries, that this is called ieeo-colica. Even the appendix vermiformis has its little mesentery tying it down to the caput coli, and from the back of the caput coli a little artery runs down upon that mesentery to the appendix, passing along the whole length of that process. From this point all the remaining arteries of the mesenterica superior go to the small intestines; and they are so undistinguished, and so prodigiously nu- merous, that no branches can be described or named ; there is nothing but a great net-work of arteries to describe. The first or radical branches which go to the small intestines, are thick, large, short, and vary from twelve to fifteen or twenty in number. But it is not these that make this vast appearance of a net- work ; these twelve branches are first joined to each Other, as it were mouth to mouth, forming one great confluence of arterial arches: from these, secondary- branches arise, and they unite again in like manner, and make a second row of arches ; from the union of these still other arteries arise, and make a third, or fourth, and even a fifth, row of arches, before any arteries go to the intestines; till at last the proper arteries of the intestines go out in straight lines from the last arch, and spread upon the coats of the intes- tines. In short, tfie mesentery has a very intricated and matted appearance ; from the redoubling of these arches, which are more and more numerous as the ^rtery proceeds lower, till the last of the twelve radical branches

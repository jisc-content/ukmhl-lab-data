159 OF RESPIRATION. short sketch, understand how the whole function goes on. There is in this kind of respiration no breathing- organ like the lungs, but tracheas or air-tubes by which air enters into all parts of their body. What is most perplexing in this species of respira- tion is the prodigious quantity of air which these creatures receive; the little connection betwixt the air-tubes and the heart; the impossibility of tracing blood-vessels from the heart to the various parts to nourish them $ and the clearness with which we see their air-tubes branching over all parts of their body. The stomach, bowels, and other viscera, the legs and wings, even the very scales of insects, have branches of the air-tubes dividing over their surfaces like the delicate vessels of leaves and flowers. In short, the magnitude of these air-tubes is quite surprising ; and their branchings are so minute, delicate, universal over all the body, that it looks almost as if the air-tube had exchanged functions with the heart and arteries. .

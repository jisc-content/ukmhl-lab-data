171 THE FOETUS. convolutions in the placenta, and terminate with ex- treme minuteness upon its surface. It is this which occasions the necessity of the ductus arteriosus, which is merely a union or inosculation of the pulmonic artery with the aorta. This union isTormed by a great branch of the pulmonic artery in the foetus, joining the aorta below its curve. This great branch (for it is greater than the two branches which go to the lungs, is named the ductus arteriosus, and may be defined an inosculation betwixt the pulmonic artery and the aorta, so very large, that it gives the aorta of the foetus twice its natural size and propor- tion, and enables the blood of that artery to have the full force of both ventricles; of the left ventricle through the aorta, and of the right ventricle through the ductus arteriosus by one synchronous stroke. 4. The contaminated blood of the foetus must be returned to the mother, or at least to the placenta ; for which purpose the two iliac arteries are reilected along the side of the bladder as I have just explained. I say the iliac arteries without reserve, because the Hypogastric and femoral arteries, that is, the arteries of the pelvis and thigh, though they are the largest branches of all the body in the adult, are in the foetus, extremely small; and thence that smallness of the lower extremities compared with the largeness of the head, which characterizes the child, and which it takes years to redress. DUCTUS VENOSUS. Thus have I defined these parts and their uses, in order that their strict anatomy may be the more

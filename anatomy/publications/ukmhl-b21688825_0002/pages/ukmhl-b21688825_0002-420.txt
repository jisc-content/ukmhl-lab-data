354 OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. which go to the neck. Let the student then observe, 1. That the vertebral artery goes to the brain, that the cervical arteries belong to the muscles of the neck. 2. That the thyroid gives two arteries to the neck, the thyroidea ascendens and the transversalis colli. 3. That when a second set of arteries for the neck begins to be enumerated, the name is changed; that of colli is dropped, and that of cervicis adopted. 4. That as there are two branches of the thyroid going to the neck, viz. the ascending thyroid and the transversalis colli, there are also two entire arteries going to the neck, and which come off immediately after the thyroid, viz. the cervicalis profunda more constant, and the cervicalis superficialis which is less regular. 6. arteria intercostalis superior. The upper intercostal is given to supply the intercostal space betwixt the two uppermost ribs, because the aorta which give out all the other inter- costalis, regularly one for each rib, does not begin to give them off till after it has made its turn down- wards; of course it leaves the two upper ribs without arteries. To supply this, then, is the office of the superior intercostal artery, which is about the size of a crow-quill, and goes off from the subclavian generally next after the vertebral and thyroid arteries. It comes from the upper and back surface of the subclavian trunk ; it turns downwards and backwards and lodges itself by the side of the spine in the hollow where the spine and the first rib are joined, and where the first thoracic

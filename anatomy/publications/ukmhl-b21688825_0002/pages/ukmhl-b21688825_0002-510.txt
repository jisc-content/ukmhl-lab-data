OF THE ARTERIES 440 ries to the womb, sometimes to the rectum ; but these branches are quite irregular in number and size. AETERI/E VESICALES. The arteries of the bladder are extremely irre- gular both in number and size; for it is to be consi- dered, that the bladder being a round body placed amidst great arteries, and being itself membranous, and needing but few or but small branches, it gets them from various sources. Very generally the hypo- gastric, just before it closes into a ligament, sends one or more small arteries downwards and forwards to the neck of the bladder, at that part where the vesicute seminales lie j and of course the vesiculse and the pros- tate gland get small twigs from this artery of the bladder ; sometimes also the bulb of the urethra has a small artery from it. ARTERIjE heemorrhoidales. The arteries of the rectum are all named htcmor- rhoidal arteries. The upper Laemorrhoidal artery is the great branch of the lower mesenteric continued to the pelvis. The middle hremorrhoidal artery is one which sometimes comes from the hypogastric artery, but very often from the pudic artery, insomuch as to be reckoned among its regular branches. The lower, or the external haemorrhoidal artery, almost always is a branch of the pudic artery, or that artery which goes to the penis. Two great arteries, one going to the rectum and another to the womb, are the last which the hypo- gastric gives off before it degenerates into a ligament. ARTSRIA

514 OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. immediately before the union. It is often smaller on one side than on the other, and sometimes it is want- ing on one side. It moves downwards in a sort of re- trograde course betwixt the accessory nerve of Willis and the group of fibres which form the eighth pair, and dives in betwixt the cerebellum and the medula oblongata. Its larger branches spread out upon the pia mater, and then enter into the medullary substance. They belong to the cerebellum, to the spinal marrow* and some of them to the pons Varolii. But there are also smaller and particular twigs, as twigs to the eighth and ninth pairs of nerves: one also which enters into the fourth ventricle, to form a sort of velum or cho- roid plexus there : and as this posterior artery winds downwards under the cerebellum, it gives many branches about the vermis, and small twigs which run betwixt the lower point of the pons Varolii and the pyramidal bodies. Next the arteria basilaris proceeds forwards along the pons Varolii in one great trunk: now the pons Varolii is just the tuberosity produced by the crura cerebri and cerebelli, meeting and uniting to form the spinal marrow. The corpora olivaria and pyramida- Jia are just two bulgings at the root of the spinal mar- row ; and as every great artery, whatever its destina- tion may be, gives twigs to those parts which it passes over, so does the basilar artery ; giving twigs first to the corpora olivaria and pyramidalia, next to the cru- ra cerebelli and to the crura cerebri; and as it runs along ti e pons Varolii it distributes little arteries to it from rig-ht to left. These little arteries also mark the sides of the pons with small furrows, which are seen when

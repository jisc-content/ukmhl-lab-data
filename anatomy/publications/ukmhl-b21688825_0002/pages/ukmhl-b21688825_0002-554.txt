482 OF THE THREE ARTERIES OF THE THREE ARTERIES OF THE LEG AND FOOT. The three arteries are, the tibialis antica, going on the forepart of the leg; the tibialis postica, passing deep along the back part of the leg; and the peronea, which is the smallest and least regular artery of the leg, and which has its name from passing down be- hind the fibula. The popliteal artery divides below the ham, under the longer head of the solaeus muscle, into two arteries, the tibialis antica, and tibialis postica. The tibialis postica continues its natural direction downwards un- der the solaeus muscle, and behind the tibia. ARTERIA TIBIALIS ANTICA. The tibialis antica makes a sudden turn for- wards, perforates the interosseous membrane just under the lower edge of the popliteal muscle ; passes out towards the forepart of the leg, betwixt the heads of the tibia and fibula : but still it does by no means be- come a superficial artery ; on the contrary, it lies deep betwixt the heads of the tibialis anticus and the ex- tensor of the toes; and is covered here with a very strong fascia. It is only about six inches above the ankae that the leg grows tendinous and naked; there this anterior artery can be felt beating : it lies betwixt the tendons of the tibialis anticus muscle and that of the extensor of the toes i it passes down along with these tendons, through the annular ligament, and over the bones

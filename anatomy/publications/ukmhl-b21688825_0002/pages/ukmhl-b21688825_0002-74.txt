so OF THE MECHANISM the the others; not because it is the least important, but because it is the most difficult, and, if I may be allowed to say so, not yet thoroughly understood ; I mean the anatomy of the Eustachian valve ; which, if it had been easily described, should have been first described ; for it is a valve which lies in the mouth of the lower cava just where that vein enters the right auricle of the heart. How imperfect a valve this is, how difficult to dissect or to explain, may easily be known from this, that Winslow was first incited to look for the valve by some hints in Sylvius; he was soon afrer fairly directed to it by finding it in the tables of the Eustachius, which were then first found and published by Lancisi, after the author had been dead f 50 years; and yet with all this assistance Winslow sought for it continually in vain, till at last he reflected, that by cutting the heart in its fore-part he must have always in his dissections destroyed any such valve: by opening the back part of the cava he at last saw the valve, and demonstrated it to the Academy of Sciences in France ; and having just received from Lancisi his edition of the Eustachian Table, so long hidden, and since so outrageously praised, he called it valvula eustachiana, a name which it has retained to this day, and he added reti- cularis to express its lace-like netted appearance at its upper edge. From Winslowâ€™s time to this present day, that is, for eighty years, there has been no good drawing, nor even any perfect description of the valve; and, in the confusion of opinions upon the subject, what its use may be no one knows. The Eustachian valve lies in the mouth of the ascending cava, just where that great vein is joined to

OF THE THJR.EE ARTERIES 488 near towards the inside of the tibia, to take its place be- hind that bone. Its whole situation and general course is this: It lies over the tibialis posticus and flexor muscles 5 it lies under the bellies of the gastroc- nemius and solaeus ; it turns round the inner ankle close upon the bone. Having passed the lower head of the tibia, it goes down along the inside of the heel- bone, in its deep arch, upon which the body is sup- ported ; it divides at the heel-bone, and advances along the sole of the foot in two great branches ; one running along the sole, next the outer edge of the foot; the other along the inner edge of the foot whence they are named external and internal plantar arteries^ From this arch the artery gives branches to all the toes, and so it ends. This posterior artery is chiefly a muscular one, at least in its course down the leg; and though it gives many branches as it passes along, there are hardly any worthy of being described: and from the knee to the ankle-joint there is one only which needs be distin- guished by name, viz. the artery which nourishes the tibia. First, The tibialis postica often gives arteries to the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles; next it gives off the arteria nutritia tibiae, which begins a little below the lowey edge of the popliteal muscle, runs downwards along the interrosseousligament,gives mus- cular branches to the popliteus, so:seus, and tibialis posticus, and then sends the nutritious artery into the great hole in the middle of the tibia. It gives many branches to the periosteum of the tibia, and to the in- terosseous membrane all down the leg, and it ends

PREFACE. XI particularly upon our body; and the effects also of accidents, deformities, and diseases in those prime organs—all this wide circle of physiology belongs, in the strictest and clearest sense, to the anatomy of the heart. For one chief purpose in studying the anatomy of the human body is to understand its functions, and to compare them with those of other creatures, till we arrive at last at some distant conception of the whole ; of the various structures of animals and vegetables; and of the various functions which in each of these classes support life, and action, and through it the principle of life. There is no occasion on which this desire of knowledge, this willing admiration of the wonders of nature, is so strong as on first stu- dying the functions of the lungs and heart; for upon the conjoined offices of the heart and lungs all perfect life seems to depend. And how universal these two functions are ; how necessary to the support of the greater animals; how essen- tial also to the constitution ot the meanest insect —it shall be my business to explain. I he knowledge of the arteries again bears along with it the whole anatomy of the human body.

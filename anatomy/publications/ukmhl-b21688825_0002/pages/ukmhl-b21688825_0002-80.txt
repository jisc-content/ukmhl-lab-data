OF THE MECHANISM 36 the in all the stages of life, smaller or larger according te the size or form of the heart. The auricle on the side towards the venae cavae is imperfect; the anterior part of the auricle chiefly is muscular, and when it contracts, the laxity of the cavas and the great \vidth of the sinus venosus, i. e. of almost the whole auricle, would take away from its contraction all effect; but to prevent this, and to make the auricle perfect, the vena cava and auricle meet so obliquely, that the side of the cava makes a sort of wall for the auricle on that side. This wall has entirely and distinctly the reticulated structure of the auricle itself, with fleshy bands of muscular fibres in it: this wall falls loosely backwards when the auricle is quite relaxed, as, for example, when we lay it open ; and thus it has got the appearance and name without the uses of a valve; but when the heart is entire, tense, and filled with blood, this valve repre- sents truly a part of the side of the auricle: and that this part of the wall of the auricle should be occasion- ally a little higher or lower, looser or tenser, we need not be surprized. This further may be observed, that wherever, as in a child; this valve is very thin and delicate, the anterior part of the fossa ovalis goes round that side of the auricle particularly deep and strong. Let it also be remembered, that in certain animals this valve is particularly large and strong ; now, in a crea- ture which goes chiefly in a horizontal posture, it may strengthen and make up the walls of the auricle (the chief use which I have assigned for it in man); but surely it cannot protect the blood of the lower cava from the weight of blctod coming from above, since

ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. • 333 the membranes or to enter into the cavities of the brain; and accordingly we find these authors calling it “ a beautiful beginning of a rete mirabile‘ an im- perfect rete mirabile,” &c. The velum, as it is called, is that netted form which the pia mater assumes often about the basis of the brain, whenever the smaller arteries are numerous ; for the inosculations of the arteries are like a net-work; the arteries, full of blood or of injection, are opaque and are very apparent ; while the membrane upon which they run is lucid, diaphanous, and is scarcely seen. A velum or net of this kind appears on every smooth and uniform surface of the basis of the brain; but the most remarkable of all is that which lies betwixt the brain and the cerebellum. It is named velum interpositum; and at this place insinuates itself (betwixt the brain and the cerebellum) into the back part of the lateral ventricles, where it covers the nates, testes, and pineal gland. The plexus choroides again is merely another variety or form of the pia mater. The great choroid plexus is a membrane which lies upon the bottom of each lateral ventricle: it is netted and extremely vascular, not unlike the chorion of some animals, whence it is named. It consists partly of arteries, but chiefly of veins ; it conveys some blood to the internal surfaces of the brain, but returns much more. But although the choroid plexus of the two h teral ventricles be the chief one, the third and the fourth ventricles have each their plexuses or vascular webs. The chief points by which these vascular webs of the pia

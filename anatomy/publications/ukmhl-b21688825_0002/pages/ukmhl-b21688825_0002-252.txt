3 88 CIRCULATION OP the the child. These things prove what the best physio- logists have forgotten, or have not known, that the foetus has, in the function of the placenta, something equivalent to the function of the lungs. One great mistake then runs through the whole of physiology. It has been universally believed that the free and easy transmission of the blood was the chief use of the lungs, as if they had acted like fanners to flap on the blood from the right to the left side of the heart. They affirmed, that either continued disten- tion, or continued collapse, hindered the progress of the blood; and they also believed universally, that if but the ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale, or any thing, in short, were left open to let the blood pass, that person might live in spite of hanging, drowning, or suffocation of any kind. Tills will be found to be the most perfect of all absurdities; and to alledge such a thing against all authors requires some kind of proof: it will suffice, if I prove it against a few of the most eminent, so much were the older authors wedded to this misapprehen- sion of the dilatation of the lungs being useful only by driving forwards the blood, that, in the Parisian dissections, we find the following experiment made on purpose to prove the fact. â€œ We have also made another experiment (say the Parisian dissectors*) to know more distinctly the necessity of the motion of * N. B. This was a wheel within a wheel; it was a committee of the great academy, who were separated into a smaller society for investigating the organization of all strange animals; and a very- pretty account they gave of them, as'shall be seen presently.

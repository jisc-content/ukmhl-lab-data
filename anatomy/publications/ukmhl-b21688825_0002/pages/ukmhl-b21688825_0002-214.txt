OF P..ESPIRATION. 156 indeed they do, and soaked very securely in a shell- fish ; but the water must be applied with a degree of force proportioned to the condition of the lungs, or the needs of the system ; and every fish, whatever be the mechanism of its respiration, has this power. . Having explained this first point, viz. the mecha- nism of their gills, I proceed next to explain the cir- culation of their blood, how their blood is oxydated, and how it is distributed over the body.

142 OF RESPIRATION. great cavity into two, and also as a sort of root or basis for the cells of either side: though beautifully transparent, it is very strong. At the upper end of this mediastinum touches the heart, and there expands into a very large bag exquisitely transparent, which is at once an air-cell and a large pericardium. Next, at its- lower end, it touches the gizzard, or stomach, and forms a large cell surrounding it. Behind the liver, which fills all the upper part of this great cavity, and the gizzard which fills all the lower part, lie all the intestines, which are also surrounded with many cells : at the sides of the cavity is occupied by three or four large cells extending from the middle membrane to the flanks of the bird. And, lastly, when we look into those greater cells which are nearest the lungs, we see clearly many openings, very large, oblique, run- ning flat under that part of the membrane which braces down the lungs, so as to communicate the air from the lungs to all the cells very freely. Now let me add, in one word, that the essential parts of respiration are these : First, There is no dia- phragm, no division of breast and belly, the stomach lying upon the rectum in the pelvis; a true and mus- cular diaphragm could not exist in birds, having no- thing to do in their scheme of respiration. Secondly, The true lungs are small, high in the back, quite im- moveable, so that no diaphragm nor no power of va. cuum could unfold them; and these lungs are perfora- ted at every point, so that they could not expand by air. Thirdly, What has been confounded with the true lungs is the vast congeries of abdominal cells, which are of use only in lightening the creature that it may

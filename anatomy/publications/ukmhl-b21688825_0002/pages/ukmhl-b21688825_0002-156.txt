OF THE BLOOD. - 104 rations in chemistry which we perceive to have the strictest analogy with each other, or rather to be the same; the operations are, the combustion of inflam- mabie bodies, the respiration of animals, the calcina- tion of metals ; and whatever theory explains one ex- plains the whole. The'older chemists observed, that when they burnt an inflammable body, the surroun- ding air was contaminated, the substance itself was annihilated, nothing remained of its former existence but the foul air; and they supposed that this inflam- mable body consisted of a pure inflammable princi- pie, which was the substance which spoiled the air, lessening its bulk, and making it unfit for supporting any longer either combustion or animal life. When an animal breathed in confined air, they found the phenomenon still the same; the animal contaminated the air, and expired itself; left the air unfit for burn- ing or breathing, loaded, as they supposed, with the inflammable principle. When they calcined a metal (which is done merely by heating the metal and ex- posing it to air), they found, as in these other opera- tions, the air contaminated, the metal losing its me- tallic lustre, ductility, and all the marks of a metal,â€” acquiring (in certain examples) new qualities, like those of some mineral acid, and becoming of course a most caustic drug; but above all, they uniformly ob- served the metal to increase in weight. To account for all these discordant changes was the most difficult part of all: it was indeed easy to say, that combustion was the giving cut of an inflam- mable principle to the air; and to say concerning 're- spiration, that it was the business of the air to tak? away

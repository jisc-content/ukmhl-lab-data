OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 275 5Â» The occipital artery, as it passes under the tra- dielo-mastoideus and splenius, gives branches to these two muscles; and it sends out from betwixt the tra- chelo-mastoideus and complexus a long branch, which descends along the neck a considerable way; and after having further supplied the splenius, complexus, and also the deeper muscles of the neck, it terminates by inosculating with a branch from the axillary artery, which as it crosses the neck is named transversalis colli. This descending branch of the occipital inos- culates also with the vertebral arteries through the interstices of the vertebrae. Having pierced the belly of the complexus, the artery now rises over the occiput in small and beau- tiful arteries ; the chief of which belong to the occi- pital belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle and to the skin: it finally ends in inosculations with the back branches of the temporal artery. But of these extreme twigs of the occipital, two are remarkable, because they pass through the skull to the dura mater; one through a small hole in the occipital spine, and one through that small hole which is behind the mastoid process. Sometimes the hole is in the temporal bone, but more frequently in the suture which surrounds the back part of the temporal bone*. I 6* ARTE?. IA POSTERIOR AURIS.

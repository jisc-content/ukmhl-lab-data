OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 282 more outwards, viz. towards the ear, the other runs more inwards, viz. closer upon the bone ; whence the one is called the deep external, the other the deep internal, temporal artery, 4. The deep external temporal artery arises where the maxillary is passing under or near the jugum ; it is of course near the coronary process of the jawrbone. This branch then passes along the tendon of the temporal muscle, and ends in that muscle, giving branches also to the external pterygoid muscle; it is a short artery, and not very important by its size. 5. The deep internal temporal artery arises farther forwards, viz. where the artery is close upon the back of the antrum; from which point, mounting directly upwards, it passes in the very deepest part of the temporal arch, viz. that which is formed by the cheek-bone. It is longer and more important than the outward branch, supplies the deepest and thickest part of the temporal muscle, mounts pretty high upon the temple betwixt the muscle and the bone, and often, where it lies behind the cheek-bone, it sends a branch through that bone into the orbit which supplies the fat and periosteum of the socket, and in some degree also the lachrymal gland. 6. The artery oe the cheek is a very regular artery, in so far as regards its destination, viz. for the cheek; but in its origin it is extremely irregular. It has not often the importance of coming off as a dis- tinct branch from the maxillary; but comes off rather more frequently from some of its branches, as from the deep temporal artery just described, or from the alyeolar

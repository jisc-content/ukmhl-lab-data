241 THE HEART. terbalanced by a permanent loss. This text I shall explain a very little, and then conclude : for palpita- tion is, indeed, the disease of boys and of young men, as I have just explained, but not of the aged, in whom chiefly we find organic disease. Palpitation is like that fluttering which fear brings on ; the heart rises in its action till it throbs, and beats against the ribs; it is strongly felt, it is even audible to the by-standers, and still it is but a nervous disease. Its intermissions usually distinguish it from any organic disease ; its paroxysms last for many days or weeks; and for weeks or months again it goes quite away. We see it relieved by a jaunt, by living from home and in company, by leaving ail business and thoughts of business quite behind: we see the causes which bring it on as plainly as we know the cause of marsh fever, or the plague. The confine- ment even of a boil will cause it; the confinement of severe study is sure to cause it; and severe study, with an anxious mind, in a young man unused to study ; neglected where he is, and at a distance from all his friends, are sure to produce this distress. “ My son,” says Wierius, “ while at Bologna pursuing his studies, had this afflicting palpitation, accompanied with a capricious, frequent, and intermitting pulse ; but by bleeding (which the older physicians never neglected,) and care and relaxation from his studies, he got quite well.” This is the palpitation which the older authors distinguished by the name of palpitatio car- diaca, marking it as proceeding from the stomach; equivalent, in the language of the present time, to the calling it a nervous disease.

Secondly, Another branch goes directly across to the right side of the colon, and when it approaches the gut splits (as usual with the colic ar- teries, into two lesser branches, one turning upwards and the other downwards. Thirdly, The third branch tlf this left colic artery goes obliquely downwards to that part of the gut which lies in the hollow of the left haunch-bone, and which forms the turn named sigmoid flexure of the colon; and the membrane of the colon is here so fast braced down to the loins that this artery gives twigs to the loins inosculating with the lumbar arteries. 2. ARTERLE ILEMORRHOIDALES. ' The internal hemorrhoidal artery is one Â©f immense size ; it is just the trunk of the lower mesenteric artery descending into the pelvis; it is often as large as a writing quill; it applies itself closely to the back part of the rectum; it arrives at it by turning in obliquely over the pelvis, and under the r ectum, and passes down its whole length quite to the anus. It encircles the rectum completely on each side with its large branches, which meet again upon the forepart of the gut, and its branches lower down in the pelvis inosculate with the middle hemorrhoi- dal artery, and sometimes with those of the blad- der and womb. This is the artery which prevents us from operating when a fistula in ano has gone deep by the back of 'the rectum ; and which has given occasion to the establishing of something like a general rule in surgery, that one should not operate when

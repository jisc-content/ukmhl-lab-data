Bat sometimes it is a larger and more important artery; for when the tarsal artery is small or wanting, this metatarsal one gives off the in- terossei, and supplies its place. DORSALIS EXTERNA HALUCIS. The third branch is the artery of the back of the great toe. This artery is of very considerable size; it gives no muscular branches, because it lies upon the bony part of the foot; it runs ali along the metatarsal bone which supports the great toe ; and it ends at the forking of that toe in two great branches; one the dorsal artery of the great toe, which goes along it to the point; another to the side of the toe next the great toe, which it also runs along, some- what like the forking arteries of the thumb and fore- finger. The anterior tibia! artery ends here (i. e. where it gives off the artery of the great toe). By sinking in betwixt the metatarsal bones of the great toe and of the toe next to it, and going directly into the arches of the sole of the foot, it produces a great and impor- tant anastomosis, similar to that of the radial and ulnar arteries. ARTERIA TIBIALIS POSTICA. The posterior tibial artery is so named from its passing along the Dackpart of the tibia. The an- terior tibial artery passes through the interosseous mem- brane only at the lower edge of the popliteal muscle : this artery comes off from the general trunk at the up- per edge of the popliteal muscle, and passes obliquely I i 4 towardÂ®

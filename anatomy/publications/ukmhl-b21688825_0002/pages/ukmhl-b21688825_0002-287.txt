That the heart is enlarged merely by weakness, by submit- ting to dilatation, by warning sufficient power to free itself of accumulating blood, is very plain; for in the plague, in low and pestilential fevers, even in nervous affections, it sometimes enlarges, and from a tempo- rary becomes a mechanical and fixed disease. How often do we read in the preface to such dissections of enlarged heart, “ he was of a melancholy temperament, of a slow and sedentary life, oppressed by misfortunes, and struggling with vexations and grief.” In the angina pectoris, which is in its first attack no organic disease, we often find the dilated heart pale and tender, so that the fingers may be pushed through its flesh. While the heart gradually enlarges, the system changes, and accommodates itself to its powers. There is little distress; often we find a heart enlarged to a degree such as we never could have suspected before death. But slowly there is formed such an accumulation of ill oxydated blood as oppresses the vital powers, and chokes the motions of the heart, and draws after it those other disorders which are already in part explained. | Of the mechanial consequences which follow the enlarged heart, those chiefly attract our attention which prevent the due oxydation of the blood.

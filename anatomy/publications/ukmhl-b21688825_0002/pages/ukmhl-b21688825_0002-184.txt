OF THE BLOOD. 132 with their other food, they use chiefly the carbonic of mephitic airs, and breathe out the pure air again, or reserve only smaller proportions, in order to form their sweets, and modify their various acids; and fit them for fermentation, by which all their most valuable products are evolved. Nor dare I stay to relate the curious har- mony betwixt the airs which they thus absorb, and the aerial acids, spirits, and v other products, which fer- mentation displays. I have mentioned the simplicity of their organiza- tion, only that I might observe once more how per- fectly they are nourished by water alone, and how their simple organization converts this apparently simple element into their own substance. For water being absorbed by any plant is decomposed thus: The inflammable air is assumed into the plant, and becomes a part of its substance * : The oxygene is in quantity infinitely too great to be altogether digested or used; the oxygene or vital air therefore exhales from plants in a continual stream ; all that air which would poison animals is used by plants, and all the air which animals contaminate plants renew. The freshness of the country, the delights of spring, and all that infusion of health and spirits which we feel in a morningâ€™s walk, are now no mystery to us ; for at that hour the plants are by the sun and moisture roused from their sleep, and this process is begun.

4 124 OF THE BLOOD. In a little while the limb begins to grow warm; it swells, and gradually the limb, from being warm only, becomes hot, and the heat rises many degrees above the standard heat of the limb, and above the general heat of the rest of that system to which it belongs. In this second stage there is still no pulse; which proves that the circulation in the great artery is not restored; the heat, swelling, and slight inflammation which possesses the whole limb, plainly proceed from the universal action of all the smaller arteries, for the blood has not yet found out any one artery capable of diluting so far as to carry on the circulation easily, and restore the pulse. 3d. But in the next period the pulse begins to creep; at last it is plainly felt; then it waxes stronger from day to day, till in process of time it beats as vigorously as in the sound limb. Now the blood has forced and dilated some greater artery, the blood flows through the limb, as fonnerly, in one main channel. The smaller arteries are freed from their load, and cease from their excessive action, and, in exact proportion as the pulse returns, the unnatural heat subsides gradually, till at last it is reduced to the common heat of the body. Thus we may perceive very clearly, that it is while the communication with the system (and with the lungs of course) by the blood-ves- sels is the most difficult that the heat rises; that when the free communication is restored, it falls; that the in- termediate period, in which there is plainly, from the redness and swelling of the limb, an excess of action in all its smaller arteries, is the period of excessive heat; and indeed we may observe, though in a less striking way, the same phenomenon in every inflam- mation

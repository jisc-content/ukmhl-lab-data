OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 366 7. ARTERIA 6. ARTERIA CIRCUMFLEX A POSTERIOR. The posterior circumflex artery is a very large one. It arises either along with, or immediately after, the great subscapular artery j the place of it is of course settled by the place of the shoulder-joint, for it belongs so peculiarly to it that it is sometime* named the Humeralis, sometimes the Articularis, sometimes the Reflexa Humeri. It goes off between the subscapularis and teres major muscles ; it passes in between them to get to the joint; it then turns round the shoulder-bone, accompanied by the circumflex nerves, just as the suprascapular artery is accompanied by the suprascapular nerve; it ends, after having made nearly a perfect circle, upon the inner surface of the deltoid muscle. Its branches are, first, Twigs to the nerve which ac- companies it, and to the capsule of the shoulder-joint.— Secondly, Branches to the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, and to the triceps, and a twig to that groove in which the tendon of the long head of the biceps lies.—Thirdly, It sends large branches to the subscapularis, to the long head of the triceps, &c.— And, lastly. The artery, far from being exhausted by these branches, goes round the bone, turns over the joint under the deltoid muscle, and ends in a great number of branches, still accompanied by branches of the nerve, which are distributed in part to the capsule, but chiefly to the lower surface of the deltoid muscle, where it lies upon the joint.

OF THE HEART. 37 Of D 3 the body of an animal lies horizontally, and there is no such weight. The Parisian academicians describe the heart of the Castor in the following terms: “ Under the vena coronaria we find the valve called nobilis (viz, the Eustachian valve), which fills the whole trunk of the vena cava, and which is so disposed that the blood may be easily carried from the liver to the heart by the vena cava, but which is hindered from descending from the heart towards the liver through the same vein*.” * Eustachian Valve. Np 14. explains merely the place pf the Eustachian valve, whioh is seen at (in.)—No 15. explains both the place of the valve and its relation to the oval hole (e)—behind it, and to the mouth the ventricle (n)—which lies before it. In both these plans—(a) Is the cava descenders—(b) The aorta rising behind it—(cc) The back of the auricle slit open— (d) The cava ascendens, in the mouth of which the valve is— (e) The foramen ovale—(fj) Its two rising borders, named pil- lars, isthmus of Veussens, annulus ovalis, &c.—(m) The Eusta- chian valve, of which the two cornua, or sharp points, are seen in ihe lower plate, terminating in the pillars of the foramen ovale on one hand, and in the walls of the auricle on the other. The opening of the foramen ovale (e)—is behind and above the valve ; the opening into the right ventricle (n)—is before and under the valve. N“ 14. explains more particularly the uses of the valve. Some authors conceived that it directed the blood rising in the line (o)— upwards into the oval hole ; others that it directed the column of bipod, represented by the arrow (p)—into the right ventricle; others that it protected the column (o)—from the weight of the column (p).—I rather suppose that it completes the auricle in the direction of the dotted line (q)—and so strengthens its action.

ITS THE FOETUS. regular and peculiar vessel of the liver, to distribute branches through its substance from right to left. In figure 1.—[a a) shows the umbilical vein—- ■(£) the point at which it enters the liver—[c, d, <?,/,) branches given to the substance of the liver, till at last it gives off (gj— a very great branch, which is indeed the chief trunk for the left side of the liver ; it branches out in the liver like the opposite trunk, (;»)—But I cut it off short, lest it should confuse the plan. Next comes (Ji)—the ductus venosus, whose office is important, but whose size is not quite what we should suppose. It comes off direct from the um- bilical vein ; its course is short, and a little curved ; it joins at (i;—the largest of the hepatic veins, i, e. of those great veins which return the blood from the li- ver, and along with it goes directly into the right auricle of the heart, which is marked (*).—This, per- haps, might suffice as a description of the ductus ve- nosus ; but it is convenient and will make a clear subject, to finish that circulation of which this cluctus venosus is one of the chief difficulties. This I consider as the end of the umbilical vein, for here its circulation ends: or, if it sends blood into the right branch of the vena ports, its proportion is but small. But the vena portjE (which is just the collection of all the abdominal ve:ns into one trunk,— of the splenic vein (l)—of the mesenteric vein (2,)— of the hemorrhoidal vein, i. e. the vein from the pel- vis (S) ;—the vena portae, I say, composed of all these veins, is the true vein of the liver. The branches of the vena portae are gathered into a trunk at (/;)-—that trunk enters the liver at (/)—it divides

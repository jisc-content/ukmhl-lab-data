437 OF THE PELVIS, haunch. Thence the necessity and the usefulness of ar- ranging them under two classes: First, Of the lesser ar- teries which go to parts within the pelvis, as to the loins, to the sacrum, to the bladder, and to the womb; and secondly. Those infinitely larger arteries which go out through the several openings of the pelvis, and go to the hips, the haunch, and the private parts. This artery we cannot describe in the adult, wHi- out attending to its condition and function in the child ; for it is that indeed which gives it the peculiar form which we have to describe; and which especially gives it that arch downwards, from the convexity of which all the great branches go off. For in the child, the internal iliac or hypogastric artery is ex- tremely large: First it turns down into the pelvis with a large circle; then it goes close to the side of the bladder very low into the pelvis then it begins to rise again by the side of the bladder, out of the pelvis, and going along by the urachus (which is a tube or li- gament rather leading upwards from the bottom-of the bladder), it goes out by the navel, forming the umbilical artery. Now this sudden turn by the side of the bladder makes the artery convex downwards, i. e. towards the parts which it has to supply. The artery keeps this same form in the adult; both in the child and in the adult ail the great branches come off from the back of this arch. ORDER FIRST. The branches of the hypogastric or internal iliac artery, which remain within the pelvis. F f 3 1. ILEQ‚Äù

CIRCULATION, &c. I6y CHAP. IV. OF THE PECULIARITIES IN THE CIRCULATION OF th)E FCETUS. The peculiarities of the foetus all relate to the oxy- dation of the blood, and are such chiefly as fulfil the circulation of the blood without any need of its passing through the lungs, enabling the foetus to live without that function in its mother’s womb. 1. We are assured that the blood which comes to the foetus through the umbilical vein is pure, or of greater value than that which the fcetus returns to the mo- ther’s system. Either this blood is restored to all its properties merely by passing through the mother’s system, and what is thus drained off from the extre- mities of the mother’s system is more than sufficient for the life of the child ; or, without such direct com- munication, the placenta performs to the foetus a func- tion equivalent to that of the lungs. Then this blood, whose value and properties must be lost, if pushed through the circulation of the liver, passes only in part through the liver, while a chief share of it goes by a side passage, which is called the duc rus or ca- nalis venosus, under the liver, directly to the heart*. - N.

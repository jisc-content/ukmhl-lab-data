CIRCULATION- OF 176 ward forms which a plan must have, but because it is thus in nature. The right branch (g) is distributed very formally to the right side of the liver :—(h) The opposite branch is distributed as formally to the left; and there is no mark or note by which it can be known that this left branch had ever proceeded from the umbilical vein, or been filled by it, or been any thing but what it now appears, the left branch of the vena portae corresponding most regularly with the right. ■ And in the same way it may be observed, that the middle veins of the liver (i, k, /, m,) are now plainly known to be legitimate branches of the vena portae, though they appeared in the foetus to be pro- per branches of the umbilical vein : they are named so by Berlin and others, the best anatomists; but that they are plainly not so, because the umbilical vein (since these branches go off at an angle] filled them only by a backward course, while here in the adult they are filled by their natural trunk, the vena portae, in a more natural way. Now, by glancing the eye from the circulation of the foetus to that of the adult, we observe these changes: First, The liver of theToetus has blood cir- culating in two directions ; the right side of the liver is filled from the vena portae, the left side by the um- bilical vein. The liver of the foetus having two veins has a large quantity of blood, a growth larger than that of any of the viscera; and indeed the liver alone seems to fill all the upper region of the abdomen. This is changed when the child is born ; the umbili- cal circulation is cut off and the fiver of the child ceases to grow but in proportion to the other parts.

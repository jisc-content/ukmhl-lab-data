186 CIRCULATION OF auricles entire. In short, while the oval hole and ductus arteriosus are open, it is a single heart; and when they close, as they do the moment the child is born, it becomes the double or perfect heart. Now the mistake which all physiologists have fallen into is this. They have not observed that no crea- ture can live with a single heart, which has the oxy- dation of its blood performed by lungs. A fish lives by a single heart, because its blood is oxydated by gills, not by lungs: Insects live with a single heart, as their lungs, or the branches of their lungs, are dis- tributed like arteries over all their body: The foetus can live with a single heart, because its blood is oxy- dated by the placenta. And that this idea may make a more determined impression, it will be good to prove, that the function of the placenta actually is equivalent to the function of the lungs; and that it is the placenta itself that produces this change upon the blood, I am the rather inclined to believe, because we see the veins and arteries of the Chick spreading over the membranes of the egg, and we can observe the artery sending dark coloured blood into these membranes, while the vein brings back florid or oxydated blood. If, during child-labour, the umbilical cord falls down before the head of the child, at first it is not pressed but beats strongly, and the foetus is felt strug- gling in the womb ; but when, after a few pains, the head descends into the pelvis, the cord is pressed be- twixt the head and pelvis, the pulse falters, ceases; the child ceases to stir in the womb; and if not born in a few minutes is irrecoverably dead, and is black

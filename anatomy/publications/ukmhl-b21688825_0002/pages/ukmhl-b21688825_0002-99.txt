From this view any man may understand these vessels by other marks than the mere colours of an injection; and he will also easily understand why the heart twists so in its actions, and how it comes to pass that its posture is difficult for us to conceive, no one part having that relation to any other part which we should beforehand suppose. Of the Pericardium. But the pericardium, purse, or capsule, in which the heart is contained, affects and regulates its pos- ture, and makes the last important point concerning the anatomy of the heart. It is a bag of considerable size and great strength, which seems to us to go very loosely Found the heart, because when wre open the pericardium the heart is quite empty and relaxed; but I believe it to surround the heart so closely as to support it in its palpitations, and more violent and irre- gular actions; for when we inject the heart, its pe- ricardium remaining entire, that bag is filled so full that we can hardly lay it open with a probe and lancet with ut wounding the heart; and still further, when we open the pericardium before we inj ec the heart, the heart receives much more injection, swells to an unnatural bulk for the thorax that it is contained in, Vol. II- E and,

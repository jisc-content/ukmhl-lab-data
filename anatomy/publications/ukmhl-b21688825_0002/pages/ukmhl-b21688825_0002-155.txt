103 OF THE BT OOD. (a substance which irresistibly forces its way into all bolie^) 4 hat converts any ubstance i, to the aerial form: That some bodies require for their fluidity merely the heat of the atmosphere, and so canjiot ap- pear on this planet in any solid form: That others re- quire some new principle to be added, in order to give them the sraseous or aerial form: That others re- O quire very intense heat to force them into this state j but that all aerial fluids arise, or must be presumed to arise, from some solid body or basis, which solid basis is dilated by heat into an air. The solid basis of some airs can be made apparent, as of fixed air which pro- ceeds from charcoal; others, as pure air, or azotic air (the great constituents of our atmosphere), cannot be produced to view into any solid form. But those airs which cannot be exhibited in any solid form, can yet be so combined with other bodies as to increase their weight, and give them qualities of a very peculiar na- ture ; and these airs can be alternately combined with a body and abstracted again, adding or abstracting from its weight and chemical properties, not only in a perceptible, but in a wonderful degree; so that these abstractions and combinations constitute seme of the most general and important facts. When the old chemists, then, neglected to examine these airs, they refrained from examining the last elements of bodies at the very moment in which they came within their power. That these must be the most material and impor- tant facts in all the science, it is easy to explain; for chemistry, ever since it has been a science, has rested upon one single point.

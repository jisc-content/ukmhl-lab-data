THE FOETUS. 189 the lungs for the entire circulation of the blood. An injection being made by the right ventricle of the heart into the aitery of the lungs of a dead Dog, it happens, that if one continue to make the lungs rise and sink alternately by means of bellows put into his trachea, the liquor pushed into the artery does easilv pass and go thiough the vein into the left auricle; but when one ceases to bio v, it passes not but with a great deal of difficulty,” (page 262.)—Winch doctrine is dilated into its full absurdity in the next paragraph. “ Having viewed the difference of structure in a Tor- toise and in a Dog, it is easy to give some probable reason of the phenomena of these experiments; and the reason is, that it is necessary that these vessels shall be dilated for the receiving of the blood of the right ventricle of the heart, and that they may be after- wards compressed in expiration to press out the blood, and make it pass into the left ventricle.” Swammer- dam indeed says, concerning the Frog’s lungs, that an artery goes over them, which has no other purpose but to nourish the lungs; and that it is of the nature of those called bronchial arteries in Man. But the College of dissectors have plunged still deeper into this remarkable blunder; for they say (page 261.), in speaking of the lungs of Newts, Frogs, and other creatures which I have represented as having a pul- monic artery extremely small in proportion to their system, “ that in such creatures the lungs have mere- ly that quantity of blood pass ng through their sub- stance which is necessary f >r them own particular nourishment;” which is saying in the plainest terms, that

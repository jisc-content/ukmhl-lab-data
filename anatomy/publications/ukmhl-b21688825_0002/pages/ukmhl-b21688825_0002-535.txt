463 FEMORAL ARTERY. Mne of the crural arch. The epigastric artery moves inwards and downwards with the Fallopian ligament, running along its lower edge; then it crosses the opening called the abdominal ring, behind the ring, and also behind the spermatic cord which passes through the ring; then it mounts by the border of the transverse muscle, and gets to the rectus muscle of the belly; but it is pretty high before it touches the side of the rectus, and lying on the out- side of the peritoneum, and on the inner surface of the rectus muscle, and keeping in the direct line of the rectus muscle near its centre, or rather nearer the outer edge of the muscle, and inclining inwards, it mounts from the groin to a little below the borders of the thorax, wdien it inosculates very freely with the internal mammary artery. These are the inosculations which were mentioned page 346. Through its whole course this artery is so large as to make its wounds important: we should know where to stop it in wounds; we should remember to avoid it in opening or extirpating tumours. I have seen some confusion and much loss of time during an operation from not attending to this. The main artery must be remembered; its branches are of little value. The only branches which it is at all necessary to mention are, first, one small twig, which it sends downwards along the spermatic cord; soon after entering under the abdominal muscle, it gives off a large branch almost equal to the artery itself, which goes directly towards the navel, and ends there. This branch goes obliquely across the muscle, while the main artery follows the general line of the muscle, and gives branches on every

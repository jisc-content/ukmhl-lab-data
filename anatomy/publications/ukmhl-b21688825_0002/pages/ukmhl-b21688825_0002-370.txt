OF THE ARTERIES 304 artery which Is engaged in the canal has the form of ait Italic f Even after it gets into the skull, it must still bend once more sidewise and forwards, as if to meet its fellow, and to get to the side of the sella turcica; then it goes directly forwards till it touches the anterior clynoid process ; and then doubling back, or returning upon itself, it rises perpendicularly; and so perpendicular is this last turn/ that when cut across, the mouth of the artery gapes perpendicularly upwards : here it begins to give its branches to the ^rain. It is by the side of the sell a turcica that the cavernous sinus surrounds the artery. This sinus is formed by the two plates or lamellae of the dura mater, parting from each other, and leaving an interstice full of cells, like those of the penis or of the placenta, It is filled with blood, by communication with several of the smaller sinuses or veins about the basis of the brain; the opthalmic veins bring into it the blood from the eye ; four or five small veins descending from the fossa Sylvii bring blood into it from the middle parts of the brain ; the sinuses of the os petrosum (both on its upper and lower grooves) open into it, one high, another lower down, and that circular sinus or vein which sur- rounds the root of the optic nerves opens into it from either side. All this blood is poured into the cells, bathes the carotid artery which lies naked in it; and by the side of the carotid artery lies also that small nerve of the sixth pair which begins the great inter- costal nerve, naked in the blood; it is tinged by the blood, and its branches retain the tinge some way clown the neck.

25 OF THE HEART. the fished by the two first branches which the aorta gives off. The circulation destined for the nourishment of the heart is peculiar in this chiefly, that the forms of the arteries and veins of the heart are beautiful, and that the arteries rise just under the valves of the aorta, while the veins end with one great mouth in the right au- ricle. The coronary arteries are two in number, of the size of crow quills; we see from the inside of the artery their mouths opening under the sigmoid valves. One artery comes from the lower side of the aorta; it lies towards the right ; it belongs chiefly to the right ventricle ; it comes out first betwixt the roots of the aorta and pulmonic arteries ; it passes in the furrow betwixt the right ventricle and auricle, and turning round arrives at the back part of the heart, and runs down along the middle of that flat surface which lies upon the diaphragm ; and when it arrives at the apex of the heart, its extreme arteries turn round the point and inosculate with the opposite coronary. The other coronary belongs in like manner to the left side of the heart, and arises from the upper side of the aorta; it first goes out betwixt the pulmonic artery and the left auricle, and then turning downwards upon the heart, it runs along that groove which is betwixt the ventricles, and marks the place of the partition or septum ventriculorum ; its chief branches turn to- wards the left ventricle, and branch out upon it; it belongs as peculiarly to the left side of the heart as the other does to the right side : after supplying the left ventricle, &c. it turns over the point of the heart to meet the extremity of the first, and inosculate with it. Both these arteries give branches not only to

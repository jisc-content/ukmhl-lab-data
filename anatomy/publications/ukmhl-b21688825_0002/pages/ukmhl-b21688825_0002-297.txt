THE HEART. 2S3 like the rushing of water. But how such should be heard in this thickening of the heart, I cannot con- ceive: yet it is certain that one gentleman, whose disease came upon him all at once, and while perfectly at rest, with the sudden sense of something bursting within; who had moreover for several years a pal- pitation which could be felt outwardly, and a plung- ing noise, which at times the by-standers could hear very loud; who died in the end in great distress,— had yet none of these ossified valves, enlarged aoita, nor other organic affections, which there was so much reason to suppose, but merely this thickening of the substance of the heart. Among the diseases of the heart we may reckon the dilatation of the aorta, a disease more frequent than all the others, and more dreadful. It is a disease more frequent in the decline of life; it is then a dis- ease of weakness; it arises from a cause quite different from that which is commonly laid down. The cele- brated Dr. Hunter believes that it arises from that predisposition or weakness which naturally belongs to the form of this part, viz. a sudden angle of the artery, exposed in the most direct manner to the whole force of the heart. Dr. Hunter also believed, that no sooner is Nature sensible of this danger, than she seeks to prop up the artery; and for this end thickens its walls till it ossifies by slow degrees. Haller’s theory is different from this, and comes nearer to the truth 5 for he makes these scales of ossification not the con- sequence, but the cause of the disease. He says, the artery becoming scaly, and partly ossified, no longer yields to the force of the hyart; and the heart thus excited

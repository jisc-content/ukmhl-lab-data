OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 265 2. ARTERIA LINGUALIS. The lingual artery is one of which the four branches are nearly of an equal size, and which of course require all of them to be equally well remem- bered. It is next to the thyroid, comes off imme- diately above it, goes forwards towards the os hyoides* and at the same time upwards towards the tongue ; but all along it lies flat upon the side of the tongue upon its flesh or muscles, and gives the following branches. 1. Upon passing the horn of the os hyoid es, it gives first one twig of less note backwards to the constrictor pharyngis, at the place where that constrictor arises from the horn of the os hyoides (viz. the constrictor medius ;) and it gives another branch forwards round thÂ© basis of the os hyoides, where its meets its fellow : and to those who are acquainted with the muscles which arise from the os hyoides, it is needless to say what muscles it supplies *. This, which is named the ramus hyoid e us, seems to be very necessary, because it is a very constant branch; and when it does not come from the lingual, it infallibly arises from some other, commonly from the labial artery. 2. Dorsalis linguae is a branch which goes off from the lingual at the insertion of the stylo-glossus muscle into the tongue : it turns first outwards a little and then inwards over the root of the tongue, where the arteries of the opposite sides meet, and form a sort of net-work. Its chief branches are directed back- wards towards the epiglottis and mouth of the pharynx amygdalae, &c. * Viz. the hyo-glossus, digastricus, mylo-hyoideus, the coraco- hyoidei,sterno-hyoidei, and hvothyroidei.

OF THE HEART. 21 seen the chief bulk of this part, is turned directly backwards towards the spine, and is not to be seen in any com- mon view of the heart; but I have here added a plan of the back part of the heart*, showing, 1. How the left ventricle lies behind; 2. How the left auricle is turned still more directly backwards; 3. How the pulmonic veins enter into it in four great branches, so as to give a square or box-like form, compared with the gliding, gentle shape of the right auricle; 4. How the pulmonic artery comes out from under the arch of the aorta, dividing into its two great branches for each side of the lungs; and, 5. How the aorta arches over it, towers above all the other vessels, and is known always among the vessels of the heart, by the carotid and subclavian arteries, which come off from its arch. On the plan, N° 6. are seen—-{oo) the two pulmonic veins entering from each side of the lungs—[fip) the opening of these into the auricle—{qq) the sinus formed in part by the dilatation of these veins, and'—(r) the auricula or little ear, from which the whole bag is named auricle. 10. The valves which guard the left auricle are * * Explanation of the back view of the heart.

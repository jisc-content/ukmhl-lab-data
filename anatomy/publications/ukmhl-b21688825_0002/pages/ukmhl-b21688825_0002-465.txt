OF THE FOREARM. 397 gular hollow which has been described, till it touches the interosseous membrane: It first gives off a small branch to the pronator teres and common origin of the flexor muscles, before it passes through them: Sometimes it gives off here the recurrent, which should come from the interosseous artery ; in which case that branch, as it passes backwards through the interosseous membrane, is named interossea posterior suprema. Next the ulnar gives off the proper inter- osseous artery, which is named interosssea communis, because both the int erior and posterior arteries are branches of it. Then the ulnar artery, lodged deep under all the muscles, which go off from the inner condyle, as the palmaris, pronator teres, flexor ulnaris, Sec. perforates one of them, viz. the flexor digitorum. But though it passes through betwixt the upper and lower flexor, it does not, like the radial, appear immediately as a superficial artery; it shows itsel^only about three inches above the wrist. The ulnar artery, running along by the tendon of the flexor carpi, turns over the wrist at the pisiform bone; it then forms the superficial arch of the palmer arteries and supplies all the fingers, as the radial supplies the thumb. The arteries which the ulnar gives out after it passes through the muscles, and before it arrives at the wrists^ are merely muscular branches, extremely variable in size and number. To enumerate these would be but to repeat the names of all the muscles which lie upon the flat part of the forearm. As the radial sends a branch over the back of the hand, named dorsalis radialis, so does this send a branch

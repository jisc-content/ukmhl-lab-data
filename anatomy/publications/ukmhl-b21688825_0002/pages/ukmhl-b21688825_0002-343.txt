OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 279 infra-orbitary artery, and a branch to the back of the nostrils. In all this course the internal maxillary artery is extremely tortuous: First, It rises with a high and round turn at that point where it goes off from the temporal artery; then it bends suddenly downwards, where it passes betwixt the pterygoid muscle and the jaw-bone; then, as it approaches the back of the antrum, it rises with a third bending, and continues rising with very great contortions, till it ends in a lash of small vessels at the back of the eye and nostrils. Before this artery gives out its greater branches, which require to be marked with numbers, it very generally gives some small twigs, nameless, and of less note ; as a small twig to the ear, and the glands around it, another which gets into the tympanum to the muscle of the maleus, and a branch of it sometimes goes into the skull by that hole named foramen ovale, by which the fifth pair of nerves come out, and goes to that part of the dura mater which covers the sides of the sella turcica. 1. Of the larger branches which the internal max- 1llary gives out, the first is the arteria meningea, the great or middle artery of the dura mater. It goes off from the maxillary just where it leaves the temporal artery. Sometimes before entering the skull it gives small branches to the pterygoid muscle, to the mouth of the Eustachian tube, to the os sphenoides, and sometimes through that bone to the dura mater $ but the main artery passes through what T 4 is

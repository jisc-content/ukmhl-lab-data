But this artery, being extremely small, would be soon exhausted, were it not reinforced with small ar- teries coming into the sheath: these pass through the vertebral interstices into the spinal canal, and are de- rived from every artery that passes near the spine. Thus in the neck the spinal artery receives twigs from the vertebral arteries, and from the thyroid and cervical arteries j in the back it receives twigs very regularly from each of the intercostal arteries, and it receives its twigs from the lumbar arteries when it has got down as low as the loins. But this spinal artery which is continually dimi- nishing, at last fails in the loins ; and where the cauda equina begins, viz. in the canal of the os sacrum, the medulla is no longer supplied by a spinal artery, but by the small branches of the sacral arteries, which enter by the ten holes of the sacrum. Of those adventitious branches which reinforce the artery of the spinal marrow as it descends through the spine,each gives several other branches; they give twigs to the muscles of the spine, twigs to the substance of the vertebras themselves, twigs to the sheath of the spinal marrow ; and, finally, twigs which inosculate with the spinal artery, and which sink into the ner- vous substance to nourish it. 2.

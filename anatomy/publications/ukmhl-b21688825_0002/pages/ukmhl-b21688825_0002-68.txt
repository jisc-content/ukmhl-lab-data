24 OF THE MECHANISM valve, meet together when the valve is close, and give a more perfect resistance to the blood, and pre- vent the valve being forced open. These are to be seen chiefly in the marginal drawing, and from their being of the size ofsesamum seed, they have the name of Cokpora S samoidea : sometimes thev are named 7 4 Corpuscula Aurantii. 12. The aorta arises from its ventric'e very large and strong; it swells still more at its root than the pul- monic krtery does ; the three subdivisions of this swell- ing, which mark the places of the semilunar valves, are very remarkable ; the curvature at the arch of the aorta is called its great sinus, and these three smaller bags are called the three lesser sinuses of the aorta. Of the Coronary Vessels. But there still remains to be explained that peculiar circulation by which the heart itself is nourished, and yet there is nothing in it very different from the usual form of arteries and veins; it is a part of the general circulation of the body, for the heart is nou- is marked by bb, the carotids and subclavians—(c) Shows one of the coronary artei ies or artery of the heart.-— (d) A part of the walls of the heart.—(ece) The three valves stuffed and turgid towards the heart. N° II. shows the lower part of the aorta cut open; and two of the valves—(aa)—entire; and the third valve—(M>)— cut in two by slitting up the artery.—And (rr) shows the mouths of the two coronary arteries. N° 12. shows the aorta slit only in its lower part, and the valves (aa) and the mouths of the co- ronary artTies [bb) are seen in their natural situation.—IV. B. In these two last drawings the corpora sesamoidea are distinctly seen in the central part of the edge of each valve, and they need rto letter to distinguish them. . o n A /Hi

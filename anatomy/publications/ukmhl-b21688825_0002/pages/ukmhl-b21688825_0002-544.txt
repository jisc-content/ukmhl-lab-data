OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 472 through the flesh of the second; and turning obliquely downwards and backwards, close by the thigh-bone, it passes into the cellular interstice betwixt the flexor muscles of the opposite sides, i. e. betwixt the bellies of the hamstring muscles, and ends there. Before it passes through the triceps, it gives branches to the triceps, and vastus, and to the great trochanter, and to the thigh-bone. Its two chief branches, after it perforates the triceps, are, first, one great transverse branch, which goes directly across below the tendon of the glutceus, and gives one great branch up upon the glutaeus, and another to the vastus externus, making inosculations with the reflected arteries of the joint. Secondly, Its descending branch goes down in the hollow betwixt the great hamstring muscles, and its branches go into both muscles, but chiefly into the biceps, and in these the artery is exhausted. ARTER1A PERFORANS TERTIA. The third perforating artery comes off about a finger’s breadth lower than the former; it makes a gentle waving turn inwards before it pierces the tri- ceps; and after having perforated the triceps, it gives its branches to both the hamstring muscles, but chiefly to the semi-tendinosus. arteria-perfOrans quarta. The fourth perforating artery may be re- garded as the last, or as the termination of the pro- funda, though sometimes there is a fifth. It perforates again still lower, about a finger’s breadth below the

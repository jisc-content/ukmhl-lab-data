Those of the renal capsule I hold to be so irregular, that they hardly deserve the short description which I have given of them. The follow- ing classes of small and irregular arteries are equally insignificant; for few authors have been at the pains to enumerate the arteries going to the fat of the kid- ney ; and none (except Murray) have been at the pains to gather together into one class or description the tri- fling arteries of the ureter. ARTERIZG ADIPOSE. The arteries of the fat of the kidney are exÂ» tremely small but numerous. The upper arteries come < from the capsule and diaphragmatic arteries which are above the kidney; the middle arteries of the fat come from the renal artery itself, from the spermatic or even from the aorta; the lower arteries come frcm the colic arteries, and one from the spermatic* which comes off below the kidney, and turns up towards its lower end. ARTERIJE URETERICA2. The arteries of the ureter, as it is a long canal, come off from various parts which it passes. Its upper arteries are from the renal artery itself, before it enters the kidney; and also from the capsulars and spermatics. The middle arteries of the ureter are more particular and more important: they arise either Vol, II, F f from

or THE blood. 118 with it very easily; the blood turns black again if its colour be not supported by the perpetual contact of air; it is so imperfect, that we put it in the lowest point of saturation, and call it an oxyd or imperfect acid ; and how far it may be below the denomination even of an oxyd we do not know. To suppose, but for a moment, that all the heat which warms the whole body emanates from the lungs, were a gross error in philosophy; it were to suppose an accumulation of heat in the lungs equal to this vast effect of heating the whole body. But were it so, we should feel a burning heat in the centre, a mortal coldness at the extremities, and marked dif- ferences in the heat of each part in proportion to its distance from the lungs. In fevers, we should feel only the intense heat of the centre ; we should be distress- ed, not with the heat in the soles of the feet or palms of the hands, or in the mouth and tongue ; we should feel only the heat of the lungs. When the limbs alone were cold, would the lungs warm them ? How could it warm them up to the right temperature without over-heating the whole body ? When a part were in- flamed, how could the heat go from the lungs, parti- cularly to that point, and rest there ? From the lungs the heat could not be regularly diffused; for in almost all the Amphibiae the lungs are far distant from the centre of the body, and could not communicate any degree of heat to the extremi- ties without the greatest waste; they would, accor- ding to this theory, have lungs for crying with, if they pleased to cry, but by no means for distributing heat. Those who have been the chief supporters of this doctrine, viz. of animal heat emanating from the lungs

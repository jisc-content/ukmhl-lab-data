ss OF THE BLOOD. Sympathy of the blood and body both being alive,55â€™ that they both work upon each other mutually: but is it not very strange for any physiologist to forget, that the blood is at ieast in part a foreign body, that it must be continually impregnated with air, that it is neither its original constitution, nor these presumed sympa- thies that make it vital blood, that it becomes vital blood only by exposure to air, and that if this foreign principle be not continually added, the solids are not wrought upon by the blood ? The natural difficulties of this doctrine are very great; for it seems to be against all the laws of nature that any fluid should be endowed with life. A fluid is a body whose particles often are not homogeneous, have no stable connection with each other, change their place by motion, change their nature by chemical at- tractions and new arrangements; a body which can have no perfect character, no permanent nature, no living powers connected with it. But the definition of a solid is the reverse of this: a solid among every kind of metals, earths, or fossils, is recognized by its peculiar form and arrangement of parts: and in the animal body, the arrangement of particles gives the permanent unchanging chaiacter of each part; and in the muscles, for example, or in the nerves, where feeling and irritability chiefly reside, the form and mechanism of the solid is in each most peculiar, and is always the same. What is this blood that it should begin life and support it, and distribute it through all the system? Is it not a fluid which varies every hour, now richer, now poorer, now loaded with salts, now drowned in G 2 serum.

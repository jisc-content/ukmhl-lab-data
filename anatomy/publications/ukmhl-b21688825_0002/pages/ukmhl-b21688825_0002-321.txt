257 OF THE CAROTID ARTERIES, on a stupor 5 he has seen it bring on a profound sleep. Is it not a pity that he had not attended more to the history of this business, and joined to these facts the story of the She-goat and the young Men of Assyria ? If what Dr. Parry says be true, that in lean people, in women at least, we can, by reclining the head back- wards, compress the carotids entirely against the fore- part of the neck with the finger and thumb; why, then, we need have no fear of hemorrhagies of the nose, wounds about the jaw, cutting the parotid gland, or operations about the tonsils or tongue ! But there is a dangerous mistake here *, for there is ( as I know by much experience) a wide difference betwixt preventing the pulse of an artery and suppressing the flow of blood through it. In the case of a Man faint- ing during any great operation, if you are holding in the blood with the point of your finger upon some great artery, you feel the pulse there, while the face is deadly pale, the extremities cold, and the pulse of the wrist and of all but the largest arteries gone. In faint- ing, even the heart itself is not felt to move: and yet It moves, and the blood circulates : how else could a person lie in a hysterical faint for hours, I had almost said days ? I have tried, in great operations near the trunk of the body, to stop the blood with my hands; but though I could suppress the pulse of the femoral artery with my fore finger, I could not command its blood with the whole strength of my body, but have seen it with horror rush as freely as if my hand had not been there. In short, I suspect Dr. Parryâ€™s belief of his stopping the carotids with his finger and thumb is as Vol. II. S " vain

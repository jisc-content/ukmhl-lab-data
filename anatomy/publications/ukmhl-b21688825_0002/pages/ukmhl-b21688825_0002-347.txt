OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 283 â– alveolar or infra-orbital arteries, which are presently to be described. This artery perforates the bucci- nator muscle, and is spent upon it, and upon the other muscles of the cheek, as the zygomatieus and levator labii; it ends, of course, by inosculations with the arteries of the face. 7. The artery of the upper jaw serves much the same office with that of the lower jaw, viz. supplying chiefly the sockets of the teeth ; whence it is named arteria alveolaris. It is an artery fully as large as that of the lower jaw; it begins upon the back of the antrum Highmorianum, and runs round that tuberosity towards the face and cheek with very tortuous branches. Its branches are distributed first to the buccinator and fat, which fills up the great hollow under the cheek-bone, and also to the cheek- bone itself, where it is connected with the jaw-bone. Secondly, Other branches perforate into the antrum Highmorianum by small holes, which are easily seen upon its back part or tuber, and some of these branches go into the sockets of the backmost teeth. Thirdly, A more important branch than any of these, the branch indeed from which it has its name of alveolar artery, enters by a hole into the substance of the jaw- bone, and goes round in the canal of the teeth just as the artery of the lower jaw does, giving branches to each socket. The curlings of this artery upon the back of the antrum are very curious; and while its deeper artery furnishes the teeth, some of the super- ficial branches go to the gums. 8. The infra-orbital is so named from the hole <?r groove by which it passes all along under the eye, from

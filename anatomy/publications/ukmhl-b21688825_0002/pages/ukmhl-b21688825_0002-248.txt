CIRCULATION OF 184 straight line towards the aorta, and joins with it im- mediately below the arch. This is the ductus arte- riosus, the centre branch of the three branches into which the pulmonic artery of the foetus is divided. It is bigger than the aorta in the foetus ; it gives the full, force of the right ventricle to the blood of the aorta, in addition to that of the left. In the adult it is so thoroughly obliterated, that by the most careful dissec- tion we crm show no other vestige of it than a cord-like adhesion of the aorta and pulmonic artery. These, then, are the chief peculiarities of the foetus* ; but the conclusions which have been drawn from this mechanism are, as I suspect, very far wrong. But this I can in no shape prove, till I shall have first represented the real condition of the foetal heart. First, then, let it be observed, that every drop of blood which comes into the system is, either by the powers of the placenta, or by communion with the mother’s system, oxydated blood. •—One part of this blood, indeed, passes through the circulation of the liver before it reaches the heart, while another passes, more directly through the ductus venosus; but both are mixed, and the blood is all of which the two auricles were cut away to make every thing clear.— (d) The root of the aorta, known by (ce) its carotids.—(g) Is the root of the pulmonic artery— (i) the right and (Ic) the left pu1- monic arteries—(w<) the ductus arteriosus or middle branch, run- ning into the aorta—->) the place where they join—(oo) the aorta increased in size by this addition. N. B. This heart is but a very little under the natural size in a new-born child. * The umbilical arteries must be explained in another place. one

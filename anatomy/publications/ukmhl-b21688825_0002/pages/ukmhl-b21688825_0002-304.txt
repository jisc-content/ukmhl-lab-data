DISEASFS OF 540 But after all these dreadful reports of diseased heart,, must it not be a comfort for us all to know, that often the most simple affections, such as we call nervous, from peculiarity of constitution, or from ill health, resemble these organic diseases, so that all the physicians on earth could not pronounce upon the case ? In short, often those which appear to be at first the most awful diseases, turn out in truth the most trivial and temporary. Palpitations and quick breathing are the most usual signs. Palpitations, says Sckenkius, may arise from tubercles, abscesses, or congestions of blood; from worms, from stones in the heart, from poisons. But why distress us wit h the catalogue of these and many other horrible things, till first he have explained palpitation to us as a common but merely nervous disease, which many feel but few complain of? Were a man to study only these examples of organic disease, he must of course believe that there were no other, and think that every palpitation portended death ; while palpitation is, in truth, the nervous dis- ease of boys and girls, of women, or of weakly men : it alarms the young and the robust j while, in fact, organic disease belongs rather to advanced life, and comes seriously upon us at a time when all fears about palpitations are past and over. 1 like what Galen says (Lib. de Loc. Affect, cap. ii.) £* Palpitatio visceris hujus, pluribus integra valitudine degentibus, cum adolescentibus turn adultis, subito, sine ullo alio manifesto accidente, evenire visa est.” 1 think it dangerous to add what follows; “ atque omneseos sanguinis detractio juvitfor I know such bleeding to be but a temporary relief, more than coun- terbalanced ’ \

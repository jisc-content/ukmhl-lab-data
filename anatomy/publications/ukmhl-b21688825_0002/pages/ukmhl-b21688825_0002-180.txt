Secondly, It has less of the vital air, as is easily ascertained by the eudiometer which measures the purity of the whole: And, thirdly, All that remains is merely azotic air, unfit for ani- mal life, or for supporting flame. The oxygene. then, in part unites itself with the blood ; in part it forms fixed air by combining with the carbon of the lungs, in part it forms water by combining with the hydrogene of the blood. Respiration frees the blood of two noxious principles, the hydrogene^and carbon, the charcoal and the inflammable air : and it insinuates a new principle, viz. the oxygene, into the blood. Nature has appointed but a small proportion of vital air for our use: our atmosphere is so constituted as to hold but a fourth part of vital air, and of that small proportion one half only is used in the lungs. We see by this how necessary this contamination of our atmosphere is, which seems so unfavourable to life: nature intended that we should breathe slowly z modified atmosphere 1 With nothing but the purest air to "breathe, our life would be quickly consumed; like that deflagration of iron, which is so rapid in vi- tal air, while it burns so moderately and slowly in the common air. These assistances which we have from chemistry are but a promise of what that science may do ; no- thing of all that we know concerning the chemistry of the blood is either perfect or sure : we have our expectations

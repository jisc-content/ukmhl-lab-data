The vasa brevia are a set of three or four arteries which the splenic gives off just before it enters into the spleen ; and as the artery lies close to the stomach, these arteries which go to the great bulg- ing of the stomach are exceedingly short, and are thence named vasa brevia. The artery ends by eight or ten branches, which plunge into its substance. Some- times we see the artery pass, almost undivided, or divided into one or two branches only, into the bosom or sinus of the spleen. These are all the arteries of the stomach, liver, and spleen, the viscera which fill the upper region of the abdomen. OF THE ARTERIES OF THE INTESTINES. OF THE UPPER AND LOWER MESENTERIC ARTERIES. The bowels are so disposed within the abdomen, that the largest of them, viz. the colon, the great in- testine, encircles all the others. It begins on the right side in a blind sac called the caput coli, or head of the colon : it goes upwards, and crosses the belly, so as to support the stomach, and separate the stomach, liver, and spleen, from the small intestines : it descends again into the pelvis at the left side, forming the rectum ; and all the small intestines hang by their mesentery in the central part of the abdomen, surrounded by this great intestine;

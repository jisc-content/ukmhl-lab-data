102 OF THE BLOOD. among hundreds of medicinal plants which they had thus analysed, they could find no variety of princi- ples, nor any other variety of parts and names than those of phlegm, and oil, and alkali, and acid, and sulphur, and coal. By this they disburthened their consciences, of all they knew, pleased their scholars, and set the physicians to work, forming magnificent theories of salts, sulphurs, and oils ; for such has ever been the connection of chemistry with physiology, that good or bad, they have still gone hand in hand. The older chemists thought that they had arrived at the pure elements while they were working gross- ly among the grosser parts of bodies. They could know nothing of the aerial forms of bodies, for they allowed these parts to escape. When their subjects, by extreme force of heat, rose upwards in the form of air, no further investigation was attempted; it was supposed that the subject of their operation was consumed, annihilated, wasted into air, and quite gone. When they thus stopped at airs, they stopped where only their analysis became interesting or sim- ple ; stopping where they stopped, among their oils and sulphurs, they made their science a mere rhapsody of words. Philosophy they considered so little, as not to know that the lightest air is really a heavy body, and that with weight and substance other properties must be presumed. Modern chemistry begins by assuring us, that these airs are often the densest bodies in the rarest forms; that airs are as material, as manifest to the senses, as fairly subject to our operations, as the dense bodies /rom which they are produced: That it is heat alone (a sub-

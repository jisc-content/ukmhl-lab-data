of The arteries. 3S* all wounds at the bend of the arm j and especially it constitutes a difficulty in the operation of aneurism, of which authors of great eminence have spoken far too lightly; and surgeons of character have tied it in with their great ligatures, as if for amusement, or that they might see what would ensue. But, as I have said on another occasion, “ a man must show me either some positive necessity for doing this, or some positive good consequences which will result from it, before I admit him to argue about the bad effects which may ensqe.’’ Will any man persuade me, after the case which I have just related, that it is good or harmless to tie in the largest nerve of the arm ? We see by that case, that the ligature’s remaining firm in its place for three months is one of the least of the ill consequences, and the others may easily be conceived. Of these ill consequences I have seen more than I will venture to tell. Tiie humeral artery having left this most critical point at the bending of the arm, divides into three great branches, the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries ; at least the ulnar gives off the interosseous so soon, and the interosseous is so large, and has so pointed a destination, that I take the privilege of de- scribing the three branches apart. The ulnar artery, which we must regard as the continuation of the main artery, makes its way through the thickest flesh of the forearm, goes along the ulnar edge of the arm, appears again from under the flesh, about three or four inches above the wrist; it goes down to the root of the little finger, and gives the chief arches in

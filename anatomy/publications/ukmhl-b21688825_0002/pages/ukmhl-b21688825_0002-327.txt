OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 263 FIRST ORDER, Including the arteries which go forward to the thyroid gland, tongue, and face. 1. ARTERIA THYROIDS A. The thyroid artery, often also named the upper laryngeal artery, comes off from the external carotid almost in the very moment in which it separates from the internal carotid, and sometimes (the thyroid being always a very large artery) the carotid seems to divide into three branches, viz. the internal carotid, the external carotid, and thyroid arteries. The thyroid, then, gOes off the first branch; its place is behind the angle of the jaw; it goes down- wards and forwards in a very tortuous form, till it arrives at the thyroid gland, upon which it is almost entirely expended; but yet it gives some branches, or rather twigs, of which the following are the chief: 1. One superficial branch goes upwards to the os hyoides, and sends its twigs sometimes under, some- times over, the os hyoides: it belongs chiefly to that muscle and to that piece of membrane which join the os hyoides with the thyroid cartilage, named mus- culus hyo-thyroideus. This branch is both long and beautiful; it meets its fellow of the opposite side with free inosculations; it supplies cutaneous twigs, and twigs to the platisma myqides. 2. A second superficial twig goes downwards to the lower part of the thyroid cartilage, where it meets S 4 the

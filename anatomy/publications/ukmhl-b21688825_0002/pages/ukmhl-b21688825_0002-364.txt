OP THE ARTERIES 298 the dura mater, attach themselves to the pia mater, a delicate membrane, which is the immediate covering of the brain ; which follows all its divisions, lobes, and convolutions; which enters all its cavities, and lines its internal surfaces as it covers the external. To this membrane of the brain the arteries attach them- selves : it conducts them everywhere along the surface of the brain, and into its cavities; and when the arteries are to enter into the substance of the brain, they have already branched so minutely upon the pia mater, that they enter into the pulpy substance in the most delicate twigs; so that having injected the brain, at whatever level you cut into it, you find its white surface dotted with red points regularly, and like the dots of a pin. But in the lower animals, especially in the Calf, the Beer, the Sheep, which hang their heads in feeding, there is a provision of so singular a nature, that we can have no doubt that these contortions of the great trunks and minute divisions of the smaller arteries in Man have the same final cause ; for in those creatures the carotid, before it enters the brain, first divides into innumerable smaller arteries. Not one of these is sent off for any particular function: they are imme- diately reunited again, and gathered together into one trunk; and then the force of the blood being thus broken, the artery divides a second time into branches of the ordinary form, which enter safely into the substance of the brain. It is still further supposed, that the arteries of the brain have this peculiarity, distinct frotn all others in the body, that as they enter the skull they lay aside one

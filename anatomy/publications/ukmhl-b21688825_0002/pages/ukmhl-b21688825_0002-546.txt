OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 474 muscles, &c. after it has come into the hollow. The two first perforating arteries are the only arteries which are large and absolutely certain; the third is always very much smaller; the fourth is generally the ter- mination of this great artery; the fifth perforating artery is rare. Such a general idea as this of their size and value, and situation in the very heart or deepest part of the thigh (for the profunda turns backwards from the very first, and all its branches keep the same direc- tion), is of more importance than a particular know- ledge of every branch of each perforating artery; a thing really unattainable, since they vary more in their ultimate branches than almost any other arteries in the whole body; for they have more space, and a greater mass of irregular muscle to wander in, and produce varieties. ARTERIA FEMORALIS. Though the profunda is plainly the artery of the thigh, yet from the ignorance of anatomists and sur- geons (who never knew till about twenty years ago that there was more than one great artery) the superficial artery has been named the artery of the thigh. The femoral artery makes a spiral or serpentine turn round the whole thigh. It appears first on the forepart; it turns obliquely round to the inner side, following the lower edge of the sartorius muscle ; it passes through the triceps, after it has got about two- thirds down the thigh, by which it gets into the ham, and its spiral turn is completed. It lies deep where it is giving off the profunda; it rises then, and is su- perficial

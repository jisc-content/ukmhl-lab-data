OF THE BLOOD. 67 part alone, when they gave it the mark of chief im- portance, annexed to it alone the name of blood., they little thought how far they over rated its impor- tance, how far the red particles are from nourishing the system, from being essential to the blood, from being universal in all creatures. They had not consi- dered what myriads of animals, great as well as small, want the red particles, and (if these red particles are to be the characteristic) want blood ; while philoso- phers of less contracted notions have continued to call that fluid, blood, which fills the vessels of plants. The Idarveian doctrine had no sooner produced a revolution in the general doctrines of physiology, or physicians begun to think of the heart and its circula- tion, of the great arteries, and extreme vessels, of the difference betwixt arteries and veins, and of the ways in which the fluids move through the smaller tubes, (for they saw them moving by their microscopes); no sooner did all these phenomena and new wonders pre- sent themselves to iheir imaginations,than they thought also of curious ways by which these motions and se- cretions might be explained. They then began to es- timate the calibres of the arteries, to calculate with great affectation of care the shape, the size, the com- position, as they chose to call it, of the particles of the blood; chimeras and fancies sprung up innumer- able ; and it happened unfortunately that for a long while physicians studied nothing but angles, and lo- garithms, and algebraical equations; they reasoned according to those sciences only which have no connec- tion with the physiology of the animal body; they cal- culated the force, theâ€™thickness, the dimensions of tha F 2 It ear ^

OF THE HEART. 19 When they are filled till they become very tense, each valve forms a kind of bag ; so that when you look at the mouth of a dried artery, they appear like neat round bags; and when they are likely to be forced, the little horns or tagsby which each valve ^s fixed intothe coats of its artery, become so tense as to do the office of a ligament: these are called the semilunar or sig- O MO ID VALVES. Now the condition of the ventricle while it is con- tracting is well understood: the auricle by its action lays down the tricuspid or auricular valve, and fills the ventricle; the ventricle cannot feel the stimulus of fulness till its valves rise and its cordse tendineae be- gin to pull; and the ventricle could not be close for acting, nor its walls perfect, it could not in short be an entire cavity, till the tricuspid or auricular valves were completely raised. But there is another opening of the ventricle, viz. that into the artery which must be also shut ; this is one of the several instances of the subordination of these actions one to another ; for first the auricle acts, then the ventricle, then the ar- tery ; so that the auricle and the artery are acting in the same moment ot time ; the artery by acting throws down its valve, and closes that opening of the ventricle, while the auricle is filling it with blood ; and again, the moment that the ventricle is filled, both the amide and artery are in a state of relaxation, both their valves yield, the auricular valve rises so as to close the ventricle on that side; and the arterial valve fallsdown, both because the artery has ceased acting, and because the valve is laid fiat by the whole blood of the ventricle rushing through it. Hence it is very obvi- C.2 ous.

THE FOETUS. 393 at the time of their utmost fulness about 220 cubic inches of air. When we continue breathing; in a na- tural and easy way, we draw in and expel alternately about 40 cubic inches of air; but when we choose to force respiration, we find that we can expel without danger or harm 70 inches more; we can expel 110 inches of air, leaving only 110 inches remaining in the lungs. Now let us, for a moment, observe how little danger or distress it occasions when a forced, respiration is madeâ€”such as is used in coughing, laughing, speaking, crying, expelling the child, urine, or feces, bracing up the body for the lifting of heavy weights, or other violent occasions, for which such forced respirations are by nature reserved. Let us notice how much forced respiration exceeds the ordinary respiration, and how small a proportion the quantity of an ordinary breathing, viz. 40, bears to 220, the whole quantity of air within the Jungs. Reflecting thus what large inspirations of air we may take, and how very little we do take, we begin to perceive how gentle the motion of the lungs must be. There remains always within the lungs a great mass of air, which I will call the permanent dilatation of the lungs, which, from the first movements of the child, from the hour of birth till death, and even after death, must remain in the lungs. This mass, equal to 220, cannot be entirely breathed out; even the utmost force of respiration expels but the half: this is never done but on extraordinary and most urgent occasions, which do indeed disturb the circula- Vol. II.

OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 469 round the joint, and is expended on the muscles at the back of the joint, as the quadratus femoris, gemini, &c. The artery having turned towards the inside, the muscles which lie there are the triceps gracilis, &c. The first branches, therefore, which this artery gives off before it passes under the pectinaiis, are to the tri- ceps and gracilis. After having passed under the pectinaiis, and while it is turning round the root of the lesser trochanter, it gives branches to the pecti- naiis and triceps ; and especially it gives to the capsular ligament of the hip-joint an artery which is named articularis acetabuli. The artery now lying upon the pelvis, under the neck of the thigh-bone, divides itself into two chief arteries; one goes upwards and forwards along the triceps, till it ends at last round the symphysis pubis. The chief muscular twigs of this branch are given to the triceps, and to the obturator muscles; it is this branch which inosculates so freely with the branches of the obturator artery ; it is a twig of this artery which enters into the cavity of the hip-joint, by that breach which is in the inner edge of the acetabulum; and this branch entering then by its proper hole, goes to the gland in the bottom of the socket, or chiefly to it. The other branch turns away in the opposite di- rection, viz. backwards betwixt the little and the great trochanter, turning round the neck of the thigh- bone. It gives branches also to the triceps and ob- turator, inosculating with the obturator artery. But its chief branches are towards the other side, as to the capsule of the hip-joint, to the neck of the thigh- H h 3 bone,

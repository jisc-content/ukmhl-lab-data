OF THE MECHANISM 20 ous, that the right ventricle could neither be filled nor stimulated, unless the opening toward the artery were close during the time of its filling ; and again, it is obvious that this valve cannot be laid down by any other power than that of the artery - itself; who then can doubt that tlie artery has in itself (like the ven- tricle) a strong contractile power ? That it is the stroke of the artery succeeding that of the heart that lays down this valve so closely, is proved by this, that in many animals, the Frog for example, the aorta is as plainly muscular as the heart itself, it is like a second heart; and in many creatures, as in fishes, and often in human monsters, the artery alone,by its own mus- cular power, moves the whole circulation without any . communication with the heart. In fishes there is no second heart for the circulation of the â€˜body; and in monsters the heart is sometimes wanting, and there is found nothing but a strong aorta to supply its place. This stroke of the pulmonic artery, then, (which the heart excites,) pushes the blood through the lesser circle or circulation of the lungs, and by the pulmonic veins it is poured into the left side of the heart. 9. The left auricle of the heart is unlike the right auricle in these respects : the sinus, or that part which consists of the dilatation of the pulmonic veins, is smaller, while the auricula, which is the more mus- cular part, is larger; the pulmonic veins come in four great trunks from the lungs, two from the right side and two from the left; two great veins then enter at each side of the left auricle, by which it gets a more square form ; the whole of the left sinus, which forms

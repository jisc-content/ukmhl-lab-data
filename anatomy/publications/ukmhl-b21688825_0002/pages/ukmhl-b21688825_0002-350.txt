OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTlt)* times with the lower pharyngeal, or with the menin- geal arteries. This artery ends in small branches which play round the mouth of the Eustachian tube; II. The nasal artery is the last branch of the internal maxillary. It passes through the spheno- palatine hole*; by this opening it comes into the nostril at its upper and back part; the twigs go, one shorter to the backmost of the aethmoid cells, another to the cells of the sphenoid bone; one longer branch goes to the back part of the septum narium; and one branch, the longest of all, often passes both the upper and lower spongy bones (along the lining membrane of the nose, giving twigs to the antrum as it passes), till it inosculates with that twig of the palatine artery which rises through the foramen incisivum into the nose. This nasal artery often has two branches. 8. ARTER1A TEMPORALIS. The temporai. artery, if we consider its straight direction, may be regarded as the termination of the internal maxillary artery. When the maxillary artery- bends away from it to go under the jaw, this goes * Observe, this is not ihe spheno maxillary slit so often mentioned; which is a slit-like opening lying between the wing of the sphenoid bone and the upper jaw-bone; for it is at the bottom of the socket; and whatever parts enter it go to the eye. The spheno-palatine hole is betwixt the sphenoid and palate bones; it is at the back of the nostrils, and the branch which enters it belongs to the nostril. directly

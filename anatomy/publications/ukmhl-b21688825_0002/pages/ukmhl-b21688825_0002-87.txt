39 OF THE HEART. all mixed, crossed, and reticulated in a most surprising manner ; so that we at once perceive both that it is the strongest muscle in the body, and that the attempt to extricate its fibres is quite absurd *. Their desire of giving more correct and regular descriptions has been the cause why those who have particularly studied this point have been fatigued and disap- pointed; the most sensible of them have acknow- ledged with Vasalius, Albinus, and Haller, that the thing could not be done; while those, again, who pretended to particular accuracy, and who have drawn the fibres of the heart, have represented to us such extravagant, gross, and preposterous things, as have satisfied us more than their most ingenuous acknow- ledgements could havedone, that they also couldaccom- plish nothing. There is no question that irritability is variously bestowed in various creatures, that it is variously appointed in various parts of the body, that this pro- perty rises and falls in disease and health; without hesi- tation we also may pronounce that the heart is in all creatures the most irritable part; it is the part first to live and the last to die; “ Pulsus et vita pari ambu- lant passu.” When we see the punctum saliens in the chick, we know that there is life; and when we open either the human body or the body of an ani- mal soon after death, still the heart is irritable and contracts. 1 * Thickening the walls of the heart by vinegar, strong acids, alum, or boiling the heart, have assisted us in unravelling its struc- ture but very kittle.

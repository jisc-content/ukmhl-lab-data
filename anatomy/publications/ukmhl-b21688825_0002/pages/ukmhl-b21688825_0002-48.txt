OF THE MECHANISM whose cavity it arises ; it carries the blood in many branches through all tne substance of the lungs ; and thus that blood which had returned imperfect and robbed of its vital quality to the right auricle of the heart, is by this circulation through the pulmonic ar- tery ventilated and renewed, and made fit for the uses of the system ; and thus the lesser circulation or the circulation of the lungs, the circulation of the right side of the heart, is completed, and the purified blood is brought round to the left side of the heart to under- go the greater circulation or the circulation of the Thus it is from the extremities of this first circle that the second circle begins; it consists of like moving powers, of an auricle, ventricle, vein, and ar- tery ; for as the right heart receives the contaminated blood of the body from the veins of the body, the left heart receives the purified blood of the lungs from the veins of the lungs.-—[e, Represents the veins of th£ lungs, which are sometimes three, sometimes four, in number ; two enter from each side of the lungs, and re- turn the blood purified in the lungs to the left auricle of the heart.—-(f) Is the left auricle, smaller, but more muscular and stronger than the right; it receives easily whatever quantity of blood the lungs convey to it, it is irritated, contracts, forces the mouth of the ventricle,and fills it with this purified and redder blood. —(g) Is the left ventricle, whose form is longer, its fleshy walls thicker, its cavity smaller, its power greater far than that of the right side ; this ventricle is thus small that it may be easily filled and stimulated, and thus strong that it may propel all the blood of the body

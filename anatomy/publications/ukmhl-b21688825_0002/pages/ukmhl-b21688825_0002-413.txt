OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 34? two distinct branches, the one of which is internal the other external. The internal branch goes into the belly or substance of the rectus muscle, descends nearly as far as the navel, and inosculates with the epi- gastric artery. The external branch turns off to one side, goes rather to the lateral muscles of the abdomen especially to the two oblique muscles, and it inoscu- lates more with the lumber arteries; and so the mam- mary ends. But as it passes down along the chest, it gives the following branches: First, Where it is passing the clavicle, bending to go downwards, it gives a small retrograde branch which follows the course of the clavicle, and goes to the muscles and skin of the neck *. Secondly, It gives an artery, or rather arteries, to the thymus arteri.Â® thymicze. These are in the adult extremely small, because the gland itself is so; but in the child the gland is large, the upper part lies before the trachea, the lower part lies upon the heart,, or rather upon the pericardium betwixtthetwo lobes of the lungs: the upper end then is supplied by the thyroid arteries; the middle part is often supplied by a distinct and particular branch, viz. by this arteria thymica coming from the mammary, but this is far from being always so; the lowest part of the gland has twigs from those arteries which properly belong to the mediastinum, upon which it lies, or to the pericardium, or to the diaphragm. * Sabbatier is so confused, and copies Haller so ill, that he mis- takes this for the transversalis humeri, which is really an important artery.

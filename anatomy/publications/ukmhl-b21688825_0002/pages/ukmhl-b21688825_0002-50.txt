16 OF THE MECHANISM cavas arereceiving the blood from all parts of the body, and in the same instant the pulmonic veins are receiving blood from the lungs. 2. The right auricle is gradually filling with the contaminated blood of the body; the left auricle, marked also with a second figure, is filling with purified blood from the lungs* 3. The right ventricle is stimulated by its auricle, and throws its contaminated blood into the lungs; and in the same moment the left ventricle throws its purified blood over the body. 4. The pulmonic ar- tery reacts upon the blood driven into it by the heart; and in the same moment the aorta reacts upon the blood thrown intoit, and that reaction works it through all this great system of vessels from this the centre to all the extremities of the body. Thus it is easy to perceive how the successive actions accompany each other in the opposite sides of the heart: l. The two veins swell; 2. The two auricles are excited; 3. The two ventricles are filled with blood; 4. The two arteries take up and continue this pulsating action of the heart. It is thus that the two hearts assist and * support the actions of each other, and there seems al- most a physical necessity for their being joined; yet on the very best authority, and after deliberate dissection, we are entitled to affirm, that the heart is found, not with its apex sharp and conical, but deft; the two ven- tricles plainly distinct from each other and divided by £ great space. “ Latro, quae pcenas scelerum luebat, quando. exenteraretur a carnifiee, cor habuit singularis figurae, mucrone non acuto, ut fieri solet, sed bifido; ut distincti ventriculimanifestius externafacie apparuerint, dexter nempe et sinister, interjecto magno hiatu*.” * Bartholim Epist. p. 107.

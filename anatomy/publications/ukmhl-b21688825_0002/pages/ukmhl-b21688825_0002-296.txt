DISEASES OF **32 of the ventricles, a proportionate enlargement of the columnx carneae, and a proportionate narrowing of the cavity of the heart itself. Upon opening such a heart, one would almost pronounce it natural. If one should speculate upon its peculiarities, he would ^finding the heart strengthened, and its valves and vessels all sound) pronounce that it would cause rather a vigorous cir- culation and strong health: yet I shall never forget the miseries I have seen patients endure from having such a heart. They have often a full and bloated habit of body (at least so 1 have chanced to observe), a pulse weak at all times, but trembling, and hardly sensible, when a fit of difficult circulation approaches; then the pulse vanishes, the patient sometimes faints; the anxieties, oppressed breathing, languid pulse, actual faintings, and all the intermediate conditions less than fainting, but like it, and infinitely more miserable, make their chief sufferings. After struggling long under this disease, the patients grow languid for a few days, often become dropsical, and then die. The variety of symptoms which those suffer who have this simplest of all the diseases of the heart i$ very surprising, and puts to nought all our conjectures about certain signs indicating particular diseases of the heart. We cannot be surprized that in great enlarge- ments of the auricles, or vast aneurisms of the aorta, or in those enlargements in which something like polypi are found, and where, as Mr. Holder often said of himself, the circulation seems to go on for a time in one corner, as it were, of the heart; in all such cases, we cannot wonder at there being heard noises *â–  like

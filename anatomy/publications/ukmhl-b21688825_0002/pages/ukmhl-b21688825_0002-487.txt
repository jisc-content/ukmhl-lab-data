STOMACH-, LIVER, AND SPLEEN. 419 ( of the omentum or epiploon ; it runs along the sto- mach till it meets with a similar branch from the sple- nic artery; and the inosculation between them is so large and perfect, that we cannot tell where the one artery ends or the other begins. This branch from the hepatic artery is named the right artery of the stomach,or the right gastro-epiPloic artery, wrhile that from the splenic artery is the left. Besides this great artery to the duodenum and sto- mach, the hepatic artery, before it plunges into the liver, gives another branch, but small; it is named pylorica superior hepatica. PYLORICA SUPERIOR HEPATICA. The pylorica superior hepatica is so named to distinguish it from that upper pyloric artery which comes down from the stomach, and sometimes it is called gastrica vel coronaria minor. It comes off from the hepatic just before it divides, or imme- diately after from the left hepatic. It turns backwards at an acute angle to the lesser arch of the stomach, and having given small twigs to the omentum minus, it goes directly to the pylorus, inosculating with its upper and lower arteries. hepatica sinistra. The hepatic artery, now advanced to within about two inches of the liver, divides into its two great ar- teries. Both go to the porta of the liver; but thÂ© one belongs to the right lobe, the other belongs to the left. The artery which belongs to the left lobe of the E e 2 liver

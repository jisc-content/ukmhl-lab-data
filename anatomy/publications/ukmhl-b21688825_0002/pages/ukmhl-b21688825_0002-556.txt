OF THE THREE ARTERIES 434 hand to the muscles betwixt which it runs, of equal size nearly, and all equally unimportant. The tibia! artery, then, as it runs down the forepart of the leg, gives branches to the Tibialus Anticus on one hand; to the Common Extensor of the toes on the other hand; and to the Extensor of the great toe, which is the last of the three muscles that occupy the forepart of the leg. It also gives little arteries to the tibia, to the fibula, and to the interosseous membrane which lies betwixt them; but still it arrives unexhausted at the forepart of the ankle-joint. But before it crosses the joint {which it does by passing obliquely along with the tendon of the great toe), it gives out two malleolar arteries, i. e. two arte- ries, one to the outer, and one to the inner ankle. ARTERIA MALLEOLARIS INTERNA. The artery of the inner ankle goes off just where the head of the tibia begins to bulge. It turns over the inner ankle in many small branches; some mounting upwards along the tibia, but more going downwards over the inner side of the joint, i. e. over the tibia or inner ankle over the astragalus, and some down as low and as far backwards as the heelrbone. ARTERIA MALLEOLARIS EXTERNA. The artery of the outer ankle goes off a little lower down. It sends smaller branches upwards round the outer ankle, which go to the Peronaeus Brevis muscle, to the joint, and to the common extensor of the toes, inosculating round the outer ankle with the fibular arteries. But its chief branch descends along , thfi

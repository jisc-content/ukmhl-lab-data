OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID, 267 which goes off at a higher point, and goes to the in- side of the jaw; or angularis, because it goes to the corner of the mouth and there divides; or facialis, implying, that it supplies the face, as indeed it does as far as the angle of the eye and forehead, where there are other small arteries, Haller adheres to this name of labialis, and in compliment to him we adhere to it. This artery is still carefully kept down in the deep angle; although it is to come out upon the jaw, yet it is not exposed till it actually makes its turn: it lies underthe stylo-hyoideus and the tendon oftbe digastric muscle: it is very tortuous, that it may move along Â» with the jaw, and lies still so deep, even when it ap- proaches the jaw-bone, that it is forced to make a very violent and sudden angle when turning over it. This sudden turn, which is sometimes almost a circle, is made, as it were, in the heart of the great sub- maxillary gland, the artery being buried under it. The labialis is a very large artery, very tortuous; sometimes one great trunk gives off two important arteries at once, the lingual and the facial; in which case they separate just at the angle of the jaw, where the artery, dividing the substance of the gland, is quite imbedded in fat. When we consider how deep this artery lies according to this general description, and the parts which it passes along, it becomes easy to foresee what branches it will give and to trace them in imagination. 1. Where it lies the deepest upon the side of the pharynx, it sends a branch directly upwards, which goes Straight to the arch of the palate, spreading its small

Si- Cl7 THE BLOOD. serum, now much, now sparingly supplied with air, now darker coloured, now red, now fully supplied with chyle, and now starved of its usual supply? Is it not lost in astonishing quantities in hsemorrhagies, and drawn very freely from our veins upon tho slight- est disease? That such qualities are consistent with life in the blood, is what I cannot believe. But I can most easily imagine how the system, having by succes- sive operations converted the food into chyle, the chyle into blood, and fashioned the nutritious part of the blood into various solids; these new solids may partake of the vitality of all the parts to which they are applied, and to which they have been assimilated by so peculiar and so slow a process. The question is plainly this: Shall we follow the ge- neral laws of the system, such as physiology acknow- ledges? or shall we admit an absurd novelty without proof? Shall we allow of the simple accident of coagu- lation (an accident common to dead fluids) as a proof of life ? or shall we forget those stupendous proofs of the irritability residing in the heart, muscles, and other forms of our living solids, and which is the source ot Til the various actions of the body? *Shall v/e forget that polypi, worms, insects, the bloodless parts of fishes, the uncoloured parts of the human body, even plants almost inanimate, all partake of life, without having red blood in their system, or having it restricted to the central parts ? All these have life and vitality, but where is their blood ? In short, the question plainly resolves itself into this. Shall we have two living parts, fluid and solid; two agents acting on each other ? or shall we follow the common law of the osconomy, call the

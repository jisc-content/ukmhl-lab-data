OF THE SUBCLAVIAN AIITERV. 352 of the trapezius, gives twigs to those muscles, and ends in inosculations with the lower branches of the occipital artery; and lastly, another branch goes downwards towards the scapulae and shoulder. 4. The last branch of this artery is the transver- salis humeri; an artery so important in its destination, and so irregular in its origin, and so frequently arising as a distinct and particular branch, and having so little relation to these trivial branches of the thyroid artery, that I shall describe it by itself. 3. ARTERIA VERTEBRALIS. The vertebral artery arises next from the upper part of the subclavian artery ; and running upwards and backwards but a little way, it plunges into the hole destined for it in the vertebrae ; and it has been already described through all its course both within the bony canal and within the brain. 4. ARTERIA CLAVICALIS PROFUNDA. The deep cervical artery comes next in order ; it is generally the least important of all the branches from the subclavian artery, and the least regular in its place. It often comes from some other branch, ,and often it is entirely wanting; its course resembles a good deal that of the transversalis colli, i. e, it goes to the deepest muscles of the neck, and to the verte- brae, and ends about the occiput; it usually arises from that part of the subclavian artery where it is just going to pass, or has already passed, betwixt the scaleni

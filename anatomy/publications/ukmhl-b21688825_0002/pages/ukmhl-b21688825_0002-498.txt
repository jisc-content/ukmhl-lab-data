OF THE ARTERIES 425 9 branches makes an arch, which serves the ilium or lowest of the small intestines, and inosculates with the JLEO-COLIC ARTERY. 2. MESENTERICA INFERIOR. The lower mesenteric artery is that which is named by Haller the left colic artery, because it goes only to the left side of the colon. It arises from the forepart of the aorta, below the two emulgent arte- ries, i. e. pretty low down. It goes off rather from the left side of the aorta; it goes off very obliquely, and keeps close to the left side of the aorta for a great way; and when it has descended as low as the bifur- cation of the aorta; it gives off its great branch to the left side of the colon, viz. the left colic artery ; and then turning down over the iliac artery of the left side, it descends into the pelvis, along with the rectum, and ends there. 1. Its first branch is the arteria colica sinis- tra. The lower mesenteric has run a considerable length, has passed as low as the bifurcation of the aorta, before this branch is given off. This artery soon divides into three large branches; the trunk itself is short and stumpy, the branches go off like those of the other side, at very acute angles: First, One branch ascends towards the angle of the colon, under which the spleen lies, and there di- vides itself into two branches ; one keeping closer to the intestine, nourishes it; the other keeping more to the middle of the mesocolon, or broad membrane of the colon, meets the branch of the upper mesen- teric, and completes with it the mesenteric arch, being

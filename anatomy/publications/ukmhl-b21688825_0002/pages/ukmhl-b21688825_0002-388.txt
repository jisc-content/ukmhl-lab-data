ARTERIES OF THE EYE. 322 These are reasons for setting this order of arteries apart; and even with all possible care in the arrange- ment, it is not easy to deliver an orderly intelligible history of this artery. The ophthalmic artery sup- plies not only the eye itself, i. e. the globe, but it supplies also all the apparatus, if I may so call it, of the eye, i. e. the muscles, the lachrymal gland, the eye-lids, and even the forehead and nose. 1st, It sends a great branch, which leaves the oph- thalmic artery, and takes its own course outwards and upwards along the eye, to supply the lachrymal gland where it is exhausted. 2dly, The ophthalmic supplies the eye itself, both by that artery which enters into the centre of the optic nerve, called arteria centralis retinae, and also by other arteries which are named the ciliary arteries; because they go onwards to the fore part of the eye, where the ciliary circle is. 3dly, The muscles are supplied by an artery which comes from the same place nearly with those ciliary arteries. 4thly, There are two arteries which go down through holes in the socket into the bones and cavities of the nose ; and these, as they perforate chiefly the sethmoid bone, are named aethmoidal arteries. 5thly, and lastly. Those arteries which go out upon the forehead and nose are so directly from the trunk oi the ophthalmic artery, that they must be regarded as the termination cf it. This is the system of vessels which comes now to be described, and this is, perhaps, the best order for the description. FIRST

THE OP EXTERNAL CAROTID, 27Â® comes out in a manner from the fork betwixt the external and internal carotid arteries: it rises upwards very slender and delicate; it lies deep in the neck, upon the fore-part of the flat vertebrae, or rather lies upon the flat face of the longus colli muscle*. After rising in one slender artery, single, without branches or connections, it begins all at once to give twigs. First, It gives branches inwards to the throat; for one twig surrounds the lower part of the pharynx about the root of the tongue, and sometimes goes forwards along with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve into the tongue. Another twig goes to the middle of the pharynx, and wanders towards the velum palati, giving branches to the amygdalae. And still another goes higher towards the basis of the skull; it also gives twigs to the velum palati, to the back of the nostrils, to the upper part of the pharynx where the upper constrictor lies (viz. that which comes from the basis of the skull), and it gives small arteries to nourish the basis of the skull; as, to the os sphenoides, to the cuneiform process of the occiput, to the point of the temporal bone, and to the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. Secondly, It sends branches outwards to the mastoid muscle, to the jugular vein, to the ganglion of the intercostal nerve, and to the dura mater of the eighth pair; and one particular branch, very small * When dissected, it must be taken out in a manner from behind the (Esophagus. The carotids must be raised outwards before it can be seen; for it lies under them, betwixt them and the throat. and

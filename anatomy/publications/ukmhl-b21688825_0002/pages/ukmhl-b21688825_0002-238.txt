174- CIRCULATION OF divides into two great transverse branches at (m) and (n)—the one serving the right side of the iiver and the other the left; but in the foetus this left branch (?z) is not known as the limb or left branch of the vena portae, but looks rather like the right branch of the umbilical vein; indeed, it is named so by Mr. Ber- lin. But that I may not convey vague uncertain notions of vessels apart from the organ which they are to sup- ply, I have in figure 2. laid these vessels upon an out- line of the liver; by which I am sure to explain cor- rectly, l.Ilow the umbilical vein (a) enters at (b) into that great longitudinal cleft which parts the liver into two lobes. 2. How it begins, as if it were the peculiar vessel of the liver, to distribute its branches (c, d, e,f,) from right to left. 5. How the last great branch (g) of the umbilical vein is the left trunk for supplying the left side of the liver with blood. 4. How the ductus venosus (h) goes off in the most direct manner from the umbilical vein, and the fairest for receiving its full proportion of blood; and how it carries that blood directly onwards to the back of the iiver, or that part which touches the diaphragm, and there the ductus venosus enters the heart*. * The lobes of the liver in figure 2. are marked thus:-—(1 )The great right lobe-—(2) The great left lobe—(3) The little lobe, or Lobulus Spigelii, lying betwixt them ; and it should be remembered, with regard to the position of the liver in this drawing, that it stands upright, as if pulled up by pulling at^the umbilical vein (o)— or at the round ligament, which is the same thing (for the vein is converted into this ligament), so as to bring it into a perpendicular posture, and show the aek line of the liver (4, 4,)—where it touche* the spine and diaphragm.

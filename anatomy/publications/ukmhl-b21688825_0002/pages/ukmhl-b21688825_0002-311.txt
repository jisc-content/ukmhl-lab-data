THE ARTERIES. 247 chalky, or as they are called bony concretions, it is no longer able to resist the force of the blood; it is not dilated into aneurisms, because of the acute angle which it makes, and the direct impetus of the blood, for many other arteries turn backwards with very acute angles; the arteries tied in aneurisms, amputations, and on other occasions, do not dilate; the inosculations which save a limb after the operations for aneurism, receive the blood in a retrograde course, and the angles are often very acute, yet they do not dilate too much. The arteries under joints are oftener bent than straight: the aorta of deformed people follows closely the deformity of the spine, and makes such singular angles that after once seeing them no one will talk of angles occasioning dilatation. The aorta, when dilated, in nine of ten cases is covered with white spots ; it is diseased; they are aged people, and almost always the dilatation begins from the heart. The aorta, then, is the trunk from which the general tree of the arteries is to be explained. From the arch of the aorta go off three great arteries, which rise to the head, or bend sidewise towards the arms, and so nourish all the upper parts of the body. Of these three arteries, the first is a great one, which contains, if I may so express it, the right carotid and the right subclavian, and divides so as to form those two arteries, about one inch after it arises from the arch; the next is the left carotid artery going to the head; the third is the left subclavian, going to the left arm. These three branches occupy all the arch of the aorta. R 4 RI

70 OF THE BLOOD. compasses the arteries and veins, estimated the angles at which each branch goes off, compared the several branches with the parent trunk; and from such cal- culations they settled the general law as heartily and freely, as if, instead of the most extr'avagant plates in all anatomy, they had been measuring actually the human body itself. Thus they had set up their doc- trine of angles, branches, anastomoses, trunks, and ex- treme vessels : they had found that there was a regular series of descending arteries; they had a tube now suited to every descending particle that Leeuwenhoek could invent; and when a particle had got into a wrong vessel, it could go back till it found a tube that suited it; or if driven into a wrong bore, it could break itself down into serous or lymphatic particles. But when many particles did stick hard in the strait places, then there was an error loci; then the big par- ticles were out of their peculiar vessels, and then the part began to be red: thence came inflammations, fe- vers, deeper obstructions ; and from such causes, or from the breaking down of the blood and humours, came every disease that could be named. So very greatly were they delighted with the dis- covery, that Dr. Martin, who had measured the vessels, as I have just told, and had dreamt over this the longest and soundest of them all, speaks of it in these rapturous terms. â€œ But we are moreover certain from the observations of that most accurate and curious ob- server of the minima natural, that there are innume- rable vessels of such a smallness that none of these glo- bules could pass; so that it is necessary to suppose in- ferior classes of globules of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and other

©F THE ARTERIES 44© \ ARTER1A PUDICA COMMUNIS. The common pudic artery*, or the artery of the external parts of generation, is the third great artery which goes out from the pelvis backwards. And there is in the course of this artery a peculiarity which is never fully explained; and being unexplained, makes the succeeding description quite defective and lame: and it is this. The pudic artery (which is nearly of the size of a writing quill) usually comes off as a branch from the sciatic artery; it goes out from the pelvis along with the sciatic artery through the lower part of the sciatic notch, under the lower edge of the pyriform muscle, over the upper sacro- sciatic ligament. But no sooner has it made its ap- pearance along with the sciatic artery, and emerged from the pelvis, than it returns into the pelvis again ; it does not go over the outside of the tuber ischii, and so down to the perinaeum ; but it just appears out of the pelvis, rises over the upper sacro-sciatic ligament, gives out a few branches, turns in again under the lower sacro-sciatic ligament, or rather under the spine or sharp point of the ischium, whence that ligament arises: it. is now within the pelvis again; it lies flat against the inner surface of the ischium; it runs along by the direction .£>f that bone till it approaches the symphysis pubis, where the root of the penis is. It therq dives into the root of the penis, having just * It is named often the circumflex pudic artery^ the internal pudic artery, the middle pudic artery, the great pudic artery. before

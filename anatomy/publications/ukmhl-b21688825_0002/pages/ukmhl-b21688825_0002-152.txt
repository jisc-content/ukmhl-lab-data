OF THE BLOOD. iOO I have This analysis of the blood contains the analysis of almost ail the humours or secretions of the body. Observe how nearly the urine resembles the serum, indeed the urine, like the serum, preserves the peculiar form of the red globules, and sweat is but a serum loaded with salts ; observe how little saliva differs from the serum ; observe how perfectly the serum resembles milk, since mixing scrum with water produces a milky fkid, that is, a fluid which gathers cream on the top, and coagulates with acids and heat. The water of dropsies is purely serum; the mucus of hollow pas- sages is little else than inspissated serum; the bile it- self is said to be imitated by keeping putrid blood. In short, it is obvious that on the coagulable lymph depend all the internal secretions, i. e. for supplying the wastes of the system, for enabling it to grow, for repairing bruised or cut flesh, or broken bones; that on the serum which dilutes the blood, and contains ail such foreign bodies as might be injurious to the system, all the excretions, as urine, sweat, saliva, tears, &c. &c. depend*. X When the blood and solids of animal bodies come to be re- solved into their ultimate parts, we find a variety of combinations which belongs to another science, and which in this place it were tedious to explain. But still (here is one great distinction betwixt animal and vegetable matter, which should not be left unnoticed. Animal matters always, when dissolved by nalure, fall into a pu- trid state, and give only volatile alkali. Vegetables, when they dissolve, fall into fermentation, and produce acids or wine; not that alkalis are necessarily contained in their formal state in the animal body, but that the animal body contains much mephitis or basis of nitrous air, which, combining with the inflammable air afforded by decomposed water or by their oils, forms the volatile alkali.

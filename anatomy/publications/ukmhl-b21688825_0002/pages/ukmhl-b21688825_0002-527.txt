OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 455 ries. One passing down behind the tibia is named posterior tibial artery ; one perforating the in- terosseus membrane goes down along the fore part of the tibia, is named tibialis antica; the third artery, passing down behind the fibula, is named the fibular or peronae.il artery. These may be justly compared with the three arteries of the forearm; and as those meet in arches upon the palm of the hand, these meet and form similar arches on the sole of the foot. Even from this slight and general description of this important artery, many conclusions may be deduced not indifferent to the surgeon ; for there are several points in the course of this artery very peculiarly marked. First, It is thrown so forwards by the bulging of the pubis, where it forms the socket for the thigh- bone, it beats so strongly just under the rim of the belly, that we cannot, at leost till we try, doubt of its being easily compressed. I see, indeed, that Acrel, in very desperate circumstances, when his ligatures had given way even before his eyes, and the arteries burst, and after the surgeons had been twice deluged with the blood of the femoral artery, thought that be had suppressed this artery, by resting on it with his thumbs. But indeed the poor patient, under these horrible circumstances, as Acrel justly calls them, must have fallen so faint and low, by a tedious alarming operation, and by the repeated bleedings, that any thing might have suppressed the pulse in the femoral artery, when that of the heart itself was well nigh G g 4 gone.

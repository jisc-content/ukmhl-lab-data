OF RESPIRATION. 139 SECOND SPECIES OF RESPIRATION, VIZ. THAT OF BIRDS. Birds are supposed to breathe like Man, but have in fact no diaphragm to divide their body; they have vesicles, or air bags extending through the whole •body, and connected with the true lungs; their ster- num and ribs expand over the whole, and by their motion move the air vesicles, which blow the air through the true lungs; while the true lungs, far from having any thing to do wdth a diaphragm, never move. Every one skilled either in anatomy or physiology must know, that one of the greatest physiologists of our times has written a long paper about the respira- tion of birds, little understood, and in proportion much admired ; of which function he is so thoroughly ignorant, as to explain how they breathe with a dia- phragm ; and until I set this point right, my arrange- ment is good for nothing. “The diaphragm of fowls (says Mr. Hunter,) is thin, transparent,and membranous, and runsacross the abdomen.” But if thin, membranous, and transparent, it can perform none of the functions of a diaphragm, and must be merely such a membranous interseptum as some Amphibiaeand Reptiles have, supporting the viscera, or confining them in their place. But he thinks to make good his point by acknowledging the imperfection of this diaphragm; and adding, that it is moved by certain small muscles, which arise from the inner surface of the ribs, and pull the diaphragm and lungs down. He still persists in calling it a diaphragm

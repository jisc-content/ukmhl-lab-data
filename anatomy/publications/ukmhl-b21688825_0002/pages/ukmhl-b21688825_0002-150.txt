S3 * <Jf THE BLOOt), which the serum holds dissolved : till some decisive difference be proved important to the whole system, I cannot but believe that they are one ; nor can I, when I see the water which washes the coagulum impreg- nated with gluten, believe that there is any difference. Yet we need not wonder that such ignorant unmeaning distinctions as these should have been made, since the halitus of the blood, or that vapour which rises from it while it cools, was examined with a most ludicrous affectation of accuracy, though it is merely water alone, having a slightly urinous smell, from its connection with the blood. The serum dilutes the whole mass, and no other fluid can we find so fit to hold in solution a proportion of gluten, or so fit to support the form of the red glo- bules, or so fit to pass easily and smoothly along all the delicate vessels, without exuding through the pores. For in truth it is with the serum as with our injections\ if we inject simple water, it exudes at every pore, and the whole cavities are filled, and the whole body swell- ed and bloated; but when we mix size, i. e. gluten, common glue, with our water, it penetrates to the ex- tremest parts, yet still keeps in the channels of the ar- teries, and often returns by the veins. The whole fabric of the blood should now be expo- sed in one continued view, consisting of three distinct parts, whose uses are these : Fust, we see the serum diluting and tempering the whole, preserving its lubricous and fluid form, con- taining and dissolving all foreign matters which may have got access to the system, and running them off by various excretories ; for the secretions arc chiefly from

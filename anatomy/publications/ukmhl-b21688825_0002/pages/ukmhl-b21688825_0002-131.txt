79 OF THE BLOOD. pipler Ifso,\ve give the mark of its death as the proof of its living power. But in bis awkward attempts to prove this point, the author lias brought himself into great suspicion, and of course into great dishonour, by two experiments, in which he endeavours to show how this vita! power, .like the life of a perfect creature, is affected by cold first. In page 79, we are informed, that a fresh egg, in consequence of being alive, resists the cold, and is frozen with great difficulty; but being once frozen and thawed again, it loses its living principle and its power of resisting cold at once; it freezes now at the same temperature with other animal matter, showingno longer any power of generating heat, or resisting cold. But we are told*, that the blood having a deter- mined period for coagulating, you may, during that time, freeze the blood, and it will thaw again, and yet congeal at its proper time; and he tells us, that he had very cleverly frozen blood in the very time of its flowing from the vein, then thawed the cake, and still in due time it congealed. Now since the egg resists cold by its living principle, why did it die or lose that living principle when converted into ice ? or rather, since the blood coagulates through its living principle, and by a living effort, how did it preserve its living principle after being frozen ? This proves surely, either that the bloodâ€™s coagulation has no re- lation to any living principle, and therefore is not affected by the cold; or that the egg has a living principle of a very different kind, which is absolutely Page 87. and

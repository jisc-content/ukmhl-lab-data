OP THE ARTERIES 350, The artery does not divide immediately even after it has thus passed the bend of the arm, but goes down deep among the flesh of the forearm, and there di- vides ; the ulnar artery being lodged under the thick flesh of the pronator and flexor sublimis muscles, and the radial artery under the strong fleshy belly of the flexor radialis and of the supinators, not absolutely within their substance, but under cover of their fleshy bellies, which swell out into a great thickness at this part of the arm. The only part of the artery which is exposed, the point which we feel beating is that where the single and undivided trunk first begins to pass under the thicker fascia of the biceps muscle; and there the artery is pushed forwards, raised, and made to appear superficial by the projection of the coronoid process and brachialis muscle, or, properly speaking, by the protrusion of the forepart of the elbow-joint. This is just before it sinks into the tri- angular hollow betwixt the muscles. This artery is singular in one kind of lusus naturae, which never happens, nor any thing similar to it, in the lower extremity, viz. that the trunk of the artery forks into two great branches high in the arm; sometimes in the axilla, but oftener in the middle of the arm, or opposite to the pectoral muscle: and I have constantly observed, when this happened, that the radial artery was, as it were, the accidental branch, and passed across the arm near the bend of the elbow, so as to traverse the ulnar or main artery ; and that the radial artery passes quite on the outside of the fascia, which binds down the ulnar or main branch of the artery. m ~ This

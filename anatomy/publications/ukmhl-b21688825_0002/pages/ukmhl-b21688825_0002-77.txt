OF THE HEART. SB the valve made it always easier to say that it was only in the foetus that it could be found : it is also incredible what absurd consequences arose from this doctrine, which, after all, is but a dream, for in fact the valve is more easily shown in the adult heart*. The foundation being now laid for connecting this valve with the peculiar circulation of the foetus, they conceived the following theory, which has come down to this Very day; viz. that in the child the great object of nature, in arranging its vessels, was to convey the blood which came fresh from the mother's system directly into the carotids., and sd plump into the head at once. The pure blood from the mother comes through the liver by the ductus venosus; it is depo- sited in the lower cava at the right side of the heart; and these anatomists supposed that this current of fresh blood was directed by the Eustachian valve into the oval hole, through that into the lb ft auricle and ven- * One author, I find in the Acta Vindobonensia, is exceedingly dngry indeed with all the great anatomists, for not connecting more strictly with each other the anatomy and accidents of tile foramen ovale, and Eustachian valve; with Morgani, Albinas, and Wiedbriecht, he is offended for saying that they had seen the foramen ovale open, without saying one word concerning the state of this valve ; and with Lieuteaud, Portal, and others again, he is equally offended that they should have had opportunities of seeing the Eustachian valve entire without inquiring info the cbn* dition of the oval hole. The reason of all this is very plain ; the oval hole had not been open, neither in the one situation nor iii the other, else it is very unlikely that such correct and anxious anatomists should have described that valve which arises from one of the borders of the oval hole, without observing it open, if it iVas so j especially as the oval hole, being open, is by no means ah usual occurrence.

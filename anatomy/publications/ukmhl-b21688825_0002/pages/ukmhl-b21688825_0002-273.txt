THE HEART. 209 the pulmonic veins enter into the left auricle and the right and left ventricles receive their blood from their auricles in the usual way; yet the right ventricle sends out no pulmonary artery, the left ventricle sends out no aorta ; but both of them pour their blood into a middle ventricle, and the arteries go out from it: and here, as the blood is fairly delivered by both ventricles into this third ventricle, and as the pulmo- nic artery and aorta both arise from it, there is, of course, a fair division of the blood ; and of the quan- tity which should be oxydated, exactly one-half un- dergoes that change. This is somewhat like the heart of the Turtle; it is plainly the structure of an amphi- bious heart, a single heart; for though there be three cavities, yet are they single in their function; it is single heart with half oxydated blood. Such a heart is sufficient for amphibise, or for the foetus, but not for a child, which must breathe and have a double heart. These are a few of the varieties of the imperfect heart; but the sufferings of children who are born with these imperfections, the marks of imperfect oxydation, and the. manner of their life and death, was a chief motive for entering on this subject. "When the heart is so imperfect that the child lives but a few* days, its sufferings are slight, and not lin- gering, so that we cannot mark them : They are not explained to us by any account of its inward feelings: They are all accumulated into one terrible struggle, in which we see the worst marks of ill oxydated blood. The child is born well and healthy, it cries and draws its breath, it is removed from the mother; the Yol. II. P function

OF THE HEART, 15 and stimulates it; the auricle then lies quiescent for a moment, while it is gradually filling from behind with blood ; but during this quiescent state the whole blood from the ventricle would rush back into it, were it not guarded by valves. The valves, then, which rise whenever the ventricle begins to act, are of this kind: There is, first, a tendinous circle or hole, by which the auricle communicates with the ventricle. The opening is large enough to admit two or three fingers to pass through it; it is smooth, seems tendinous, is « /„ /•tctt/etr ( Ilir///, Auricular Valves explained* Fig. 7. shows the Auricle and Ventricle cut open, and tile ralv£ hanging in three great divisions.—(a) Part of the inside of the Auricle.-—(£) Part of the inside of the Ventricle.—(c) The Ten- dinous Circle from which the membrane of the valve arises.— (d) The Columns Carnete.-—(<>) The Cordas Tendtnex.—{fff ) The three great divisions of the Valve.——N° 8. shows the circle of the entrance of the Auricle still entire ; where—(g)—marks the entrance into the Auricle.—(fff) The three great divisions of the Valve.—(d) The Column Carnes ; and—(e) The Cordte Tendines?.

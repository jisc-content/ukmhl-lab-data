134 OF RESPIRATION. now full time to correct many mistakes into which modern as well as ancient authors have wandered, • from want of general principles, and from want of anatomical knowledge. I shall endeavour to make this chapter interesting and short. At one time all authors believed that the lungs were moved, not by any external agent, but by some inter- nal power residing in the lungs. When in their first essays to investigate this subject they opened the thorax, or rather the body, of amphi- bious animals, they observed that the creature lay out upon the table with expanded lungs; that the lungs continued for hours to appear like inflated bladders ; the lungs expanded, the heart playing, the creature quite alive. When they emptied their lungs for them by thrusting tubes down the trachea, or pressing the lungs, the lungs entirely subsided; but in a little while the lungs, at the creature’s will, rose again into complete inflation ; again they appeared like two tense bladders. Surely, said they, there resides some expansile power in the lungs themselves ? But when a few of them began to pursue this mistake with serious experiments, they committed absurdities which should be noticed, for they serve to illustrate the true doctrine concerning the expansion of the lungs. Mr. Houston, in our Philosophical Transactions, Undertook to prove the following things, which, to use the words of a learned author in our university, “ are So improbable as to be incredible;” first, That the breathing of a Bog is nothing affected by any wound of the thorax, if only the lungs themselves be not hurt; secondly. That the lungs never collapse, though the

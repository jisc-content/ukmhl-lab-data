310 OF THE ARTERIES. do not absolutely touch; they form a communication with each other, which of course is exceedingly short, but pretty large. It is this short communication which completes the circle of Willis at its fore part. This cross communication betwixt the arteries of the opposite sides passes just before the sella turcica and pituitary gland, and exactly in the middle it sends off an artery, which goes down into the third ventricle, and gives branches to the fore part of the fornix and to the septum lucidum. After this communication, both arteries rise, with a large sweep along the fiat surface of that deep di- vision which the falx makes betwixt the two hemi- spheres of the brain ; there each divides into its two great branches; one attaches itself to the corpus cal- losum, or that arch which we see upon holding apart the two hemispheres ; it arches along with the corpus callosum so as to describe a semicircle ; It is the larger of the two branches; it it named arteria corporis callosi : the other branch keeps upon the flat sur- face of the brain, where the one hemisphere lies flat upon the other, and it rises in a beautiful arch within the pia mater, dividing into beautiful and very mi- nute ramifications before it enters actually into the substance of the brain. These two great branches of the anterior artery are well distinguished by Wepfer by the names of arteria profunda and arteria sublimis ithe deep and super- ficial of the anterior artery), as there is a deep and a superficial branch of the middle artery. The arch of the arteria anterior cerebri overhangs in a manner that of the artery of the corpus callosum, and both of them

GENERAL PLAN OF 250 there are few important branches; and, finally, its branches, into which it divides at the bend of the arm, are named radial, ulnar, and interosseous, because they respectively run along these parts, the radius, the ulna, and the interosseous membrane. THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL AORTA., The aorta, after completing its arch, passes through the thorax, giving but few branches, and those very slender. But the abdominal aorta, as soon as it has emereged from under the legs of the diaphragm, gives three great abdominal arteries: First the celiac, going in three branches to the liver, the stomach, and the spleen; secondly, the superior mesenteric, which furnishes all the small intestines; and, thirdly, the lower mesenteric, which supplies most of the great intestines down to the rectum. The arteries of the kidneys and of the testicles follow these, and then the aorta divides into two great branches for the pelvis and legs. The iliac arteries are the two great branches into which the aorta divides within the abdomen, and these again are each subdivided into two great arteries; the internal iliacs to supply the pelvis, the external iliacs to go to the thigh. INTERNAL ILIACS. The internal iliac supplies the bladder, the rectum, the womb, with lesser arteries; but its great arteries go out by the openings of the pelvis to supply the very large muscles of the hip and thigh. Thus the

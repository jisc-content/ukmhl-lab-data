OF THE FIXED VISCERA, upper mesenteric artery, go to the fat and glands, and play over the vena cava (at least those of the right side do), and go to the middle parts of the gland, whence they are named capsulares mediae. Thirdly, they have their last arteries sent upwards to them from the emulgent artery, or artery of the kidney. They are named the lower capsular arteries. ARTERIT: RENALES. The two renal or emulgent arteries, the two arteries of the kidneys, go off from the sides of the aorta, midway betwixt the upper and lower mesen- teric arteries. Each goes to its kidney almost at a right angle, arching a little over the bulging belly of the psoas muscle. The aorta is still a little inclined to the left side, and so the left emulgent is shorter, and mounts over its accompanying vein; while the right kidney, being further off from the aorta, and some- what lower, on account of the liver being on that side, the right artery is longer, and is covered by its emul- gent vein. When the emulgent artery, which is short and very thick, arrives at the concave edge of the kidney, it is divided into three or four large branches, which surround the pelvis, or beginning of the ure- ter, plunge into the substance of the kidney, and inosculate and make arches with each other. Then they, in supplying the kidney within its substance, form circles and arches over the roots of the papillae uriniferse, or secreting parts of the kidney, the vessels being thus distinct from the glandular part; the vascu- lar part, being outermost, is called cortical; the secret- ing, being innermost, is named the tubular part.

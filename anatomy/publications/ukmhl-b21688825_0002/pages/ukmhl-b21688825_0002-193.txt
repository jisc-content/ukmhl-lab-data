OF RESPIRATION. 141 tjf the human lungs ; they are seated in the very up- permost part of the chest, are closely braced down to the back, and are indeed in part niched in among the ribs, which in birds have their edges very deep. These are the true lungs for oxydating the blood; they never move ; the air passes through them in the following way. These lungs cannot move, because they are braced down by a membrane very thin, and cobweb-like, yet very strong. This membrane is a peritoneum, li- ning at once the whole thorax and abdomen (which still are not parted from each other), and it is a cover- ing to the lungs, liver, and other viscera; but also the same cobweb-like membrane forms cells, which fill the whole cavity from the neck down to the anus, and from the breast-bone to the back; and which are so attached to all the surfaces, being, as I have said the lining membrane, that as the breast moves these cells must move. These cells appear at first sight quite irregular ; and Mr. Hunter gives but an idle description of them along with that of- the septum, which he calls the diaphragm: But I hold it as a principle, that, al- though we may not see it, yet all is orderly in the ani- mal body; in fact the order of these cells is ex- tremely regular: First, there is a membrane which comes down from the breast-bone in a perpendicular direction till it touches the viscera; it runs the whole length of this common cavity of breast and abdomen; it enters into the great cleft of the liver, and so divides the liver into two lobes, serving as a li- gament for the liver, a a mediastinum to divide the great

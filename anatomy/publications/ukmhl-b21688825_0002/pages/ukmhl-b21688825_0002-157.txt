OF THE BLOOD. *0.o away continually the superabundant phlogiston of the Mood; but how a metal should pass from a mild to a most acrimonious and caustic state; and above all, how by the loss of its inflammable principle it should not lose in weight, but increase in weight! This was the Gordian knot which they had to untie, and which they cut lustily, betaking themselves, in defiance of all philosophy, to the absurd project of a principle of ab- solute lightness. They all agreed to call the phlogistic principle a principle of absolute levity; and thus their doctrine stood for many years, viz. that when phlogiston, or inflammable principle, was added to the calx of any metal, as to red lead, by roasting it with any inflammable bodyâ€”the metallic lustre, tenacity, ductility, were restored, and the metal became lighter withal, because it now had within it the principle of levity. But that when by heat and air it was cal- cined, this principle was driven out, and then the metallic lustre, tenacity, ductility, &c. were lost by the absence of the inflammable principle upon which they all depended; but the weight of it was increased, for the principle of levity was gone. This is the brief abstract of the theory to which the very best che- mists have addicted themselves down to the present times. But the chief perfection of modern chemistry is, that its apparatus is so perfect, that it can employ exactly a certain quantity of air in calcining a metal; it can collect that air again to the twentieth part of a grain; it can prove whether the metal has really been giving out any inflammable principle to the air, or whether it has received matter from the air, and how

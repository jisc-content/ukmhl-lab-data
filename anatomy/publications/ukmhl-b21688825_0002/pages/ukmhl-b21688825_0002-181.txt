But after this view of animal respiration, it is not easy to refrain from saying a few words on the respi- ration of plants, which bears a relation to animals of infinite importance, and indeed to all nature. Water has all the appearance of a pure and simple element, but it is in truth a compound body, con- sisting of two parts; of inflammable air for its basis, and of oxygen combined with it, in that great pro- portion which the great appetite of inflammable air requires: and as inflammable air, when saturated with oxygen , forms not any acid air, but pure wa- ter, it has changed its name, and is now called hy- drogen air. When we make water pass through a bed of charcoal, heated to a great degree, the oxy- gene is seized by the carbon and converted into fixed * Vide page 236. K air; VOL. II.

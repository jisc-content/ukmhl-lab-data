97 OF THE BLOOD* paring the two, written whole pamphlets upon the subject, and named it the Albuminous Fluid, although it coagulates like gluten, although it putrefies like flesh, although it gives out upon distillation ammonia and a black and fetid oil; yet it is most natural that alonsr with these it should contain also some foreign O bodies, as a saccharine or extractive matter, belonging to vegetables, and some proportion of the oxalic, ma- lic, or other vegetable acids. Serum or the albuminous fluid is like whey, of a yellowish, or rather greenish colour, of an unctuous or slippery feeling among the fingersr; it is slightly saline, and its salt is chiefly of an alkaline nature 5 it contains soda completely formed, by which it turns vegetable reds to green; it coagulates firmly with a heat much lower than that which makes it boil: be- ing dropped into hot water, it coagulates as it falls ; by 150 degrees of heat it coagulates into an albumen * like the white of an egg; but if gradually evaporated,, the cake which remains is quite similar to the gluten of the blood. It is upon this alkali that the fluidity of the serum seems to depend ; spirits of wine do in- deed seem to congeal the blood, but it is not a true coagulation, since it depends merely on the avidity of spirits for water, by which the spirit of wine takes the water to itself, thickens the serum, and makes the whole turbid; but acids produce a true coagula- tion by seizing that alkali on which the fluidity truly depends. To say that lime coagulates the serum, but melts down the lymph, is by no means to establish a rational distinction betwixt the cake of gluten and this gluten Vol.'II. H which

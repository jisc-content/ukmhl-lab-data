OF THE ARTERIES, &C. 379 The The humeral artery still continues an undivided trunk, much lower than the bend of the arm; though we are accustomed to name that as the place at which it divides. The whole arm, it must be remembered, is covered with a fascia, and that fascia lies over the artery; but at the bend of the arm there is a pecu- liar fascia, or at least the round tendon of the biceps so strengthens the general fascia, by sending a broad expansion obliquely across the bend of the arm (which fascia is fixed into the condyle and down the edge of the ulna), that we call this expansion peculiarly the tendon of the biceps, and say that the artery is at the bend of the arm covered and protected by the tendon of the biceps muscle. The condition then of the artery is shortly this : It comes from the inside of the arm, inclining all along towards the middle of the bend or folding of the forearm ; there, without any parti- cular ring or aperture for its admission, it passes under the aponeurosis of the biceps muscle; for the aponeurosis of the biceps and of the arm in general are one continued sheath. When thus lodged behind the tendon, it lies in a deep hollow betwixt the flexors and extensors of the arm, or, in other words, betwixt the muscles of the upper and of the lower edge; the ten- don of the biceps covers this triangular hollow; the floor or bottom of it is the coronary process of the ulna and the forepart of the elbow-joint, and there the artery lies imbedded in cellular substance, encircled by those veins which accompany the artery particularly, and which are thence named venae comites; and it car- ries along with it a nerve in diameter equal to itself, and this nerve is named the great radial nerve.

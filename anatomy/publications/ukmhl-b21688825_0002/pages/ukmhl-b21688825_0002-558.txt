486 OF THE THREE ARTERIES. arteries to the bellies of the extensor brevis, where it lies under it. But its greatest arteries are the interosseous arteries, which it sends along the interstices betwixt the meta- tarsal bones. These interosseous arteries are three in number; they run along in that interstice which holds the interosseous muscles ; and when they arrive at the end of that furrow, or, in other words, at the place of the forking of the toes, each interosseous artery turns down to the sole of the foot, and goes into the fork of each digital arch, on the lowest side of the toes. Sometimes these arteries give also small dorsal arteries to the baclys of the toes. The tibial artery having proceeded along the tarsal bones, and arrived at the lower, heads of the metatar- sal bones, and having first given off some trivial branches to the joints of the foot on its inner side, and to the bones and muscles about the root of the great tee, next gives off a metatarsal artery*. ARTERIA METATARSEA. The artery of the metatarsus or instep goes off at the head of the first metatarsal bone. It bends across the roots of the metatarsal bones to the root of the little toe ; and it distributes branches to the ten- dons of the peronsei muscles, and ends in the abduc- tor of the little toe, and in the skin over the outer * N. B. Betwixt the tarsal and metatarsal artery, there is usually a small branch going outwards to the outer edge of the foot, i. e. in the same direction with both these arteries, but yery small. edge

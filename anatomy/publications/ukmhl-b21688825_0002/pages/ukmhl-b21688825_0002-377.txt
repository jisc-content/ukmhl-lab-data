311 OF THE BRAIN, them inosculate under the falx with the arteries of the opposite side. 3. ARTERIA COMM UNICANS. The communicating artery goes as directly backwards from the middle artery as the anterior ar- tery goes forwards. It is small, proceeds backwards, and a little inwards; it goes round the sides of the corpora mamillaria, and is about a quarter of an inch in length before it meets the vertebra] artery; and though it does give off small twigs, as to the infundi- bulum, to the optic nerve, to the crura cerebri, and especially one of greater size, to the choroid plexus; yet , all these are trivial arteries, such as every trunk at the basis of the brain gives off. It is not its twigs that are to be observed, but itself only that is important, as forming one of the largest and most important inoscu- lations of the body. It unites the middle artery of the brain, which is the trunk of the carotid, with the posterior artery of the brain, which is the first and greatest branch of the vertebral artery. This anastomosis is the circle of Willis, too re- markable not to have been very long observed; it was drawn by Veslingius and by Casserius; it is but ill represented by Bidloo and by Cowper; it is not a circle, but is right lined, and of course angular: it is of very unequal size; in one body it is large, in another smaller, often even in the same body; it is irregular, the one side being large and the other small. This inosculation brings us round to the first of the vertebral arteries, viz. the arteria posterior cere- X 4 bri ;

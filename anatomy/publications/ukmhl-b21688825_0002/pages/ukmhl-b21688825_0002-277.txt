THE HEART, 213 P 3 the collapse, and so obtaining a fuller draught, a draught of 110 ounces of air, to be mixed with the 110 ounces which must always remain in the lungs ? After half an hour of a kind of breathing;, most awful to behold, but much more effectual than com- mon breathing, the child recovers slowly. The boy^ when advanced a few years, knows how to prevent the fit; but the child of two or three years old knows only how to struggle with it: yet this Struggle being a more effectual breathing, the child is relieved at once from an anxiety, and oppression, and throbbing, which precedes the fit for many days; the languor goes off, the heat in some degree returns, and the lips acquire a Vermillion colour and the skin a higher tint, which last for many hours after the fit is gone. In those children, again, which have the heart so formed that they may live not two or three years only, but to the age of 15 years, it naturally happens that the symptoms follow each other in their course very slowly; and the ill oxydation of the blood in this its slower progress it is very curious to observe. There is one thing in the economy of the foetus very singular, viz. that whiie it is receiving much oxy- dated blood from the mother, but a small portion goes through the ductus venosus directly to the heart, much of it circulates through the liver, and is spoiled (we must suppose.) What then can this mean ? Sure- ly the child, the chick, the foetus of ever) kind, needs less of this principle of oxygene : the foetus lives (if this be so) like an amphibious creature; perhaps it has little oxydated blood; yet being totally deprived of that little, it soon dies. Perhaps the foetus, living

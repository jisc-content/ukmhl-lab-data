S8S OF THE FOREARM. Fourthly, The course of this double artery tempts me to believe, that in those few cases where the blood of an aneurism was truly diffused, where it was aft ecchymosis, where the blood was not confined by the fascia, but poured out under the skin, and driven up- wards to the shoulder, and downwards to the fingers^ giving the whole arm the appearance of mortification j that in such rare cases, there must have be6n a high division, and that the preternatural artery had been wounded, for it lies above the fascia, it is lodged in no hollow, such as might receive its blood, nor covered by any membrane which might confine it; but at all events, I am persuaded that Hunter is wrong in suspecting that, since the pulse so seldom returns instantly, this preternatural artery and the true one must be often tied together ; for if the preternatural artery were wounded, it would be a very diffused aneurism, under the skin and above the fascia ; but the main artery would be found in its place, under the fascia, quite safe ; whereas, if the true artery were wounded, the tumour would be under the true fascia, the preternatural artery would cress by the side of the tumour, or over it, and the wounded artery being^at the bottom of its own tumour, the two arteries would be six inches apart. Besides, the necessity of sup- posing this is not so strong as Hunter believed ; I have seen the pulse return during the dressing of the arm, when the dissection was so wide and free that I am sure there could be no lusus naturae, but one artery dividing in the common place. Fifthly, The close connection of the artery with the great radial nerve must always be considered in all

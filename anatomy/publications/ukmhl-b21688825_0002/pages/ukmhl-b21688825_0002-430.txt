OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 364 artery; it divides into two great branches, which course all over the lower or hollow surface of the scapula : o ne of these is deeper, runs downwards along the naked border of the scapula, lies under the muscles upon the flat bone, and supplies the inner surface of the subscapular muscle with many branches. It sends a branch upwards, which runs along the inner surface of the neck of the scapula, runs still forwards under the root of the caracoid process, and its extreme branch goes round by the basis of the scapula to make an inosculation with the larger branch. Secondly, The larger branch keeps nearer the sur- face, and supplies all the outer side of the subscapular muscle. Its general course is round the scapula, down the fore edge, then round by the lower angle, then up by the line of the basis scapulae, encircling it with what might be named a coronary artery. It first gives branches to the teres major; then passes down along that muscle to the angle of the scapula; then turning along the angle of the scapula (which it does not do without leaving many branches behind), it runs in a waving line all round the basis scapulae, till it arrives at the upper corner, where it ends in free inosculations, both with its own deeper branch, and also with the suprascapular artery which comes along the shoulder. Now this great branch, with all its arteries, belongs entirely to the lower surface of the scapula ; but the branch which leaves it at the neck of the scapula turns round under its lower edge, gets to the upper surface of the scapula, runs in under the infra- spinatus

VO CIRCULATION OF 2. This blood does not pass through the circulation of the lungs; perhaps it ought not to pass; for there being no respiration, no air admitted to the lungs, the blood might rather be contaminated; perhaps it can- not pass, the lungs never having been expanded with air: but, however that be, there is a side passage for conveying it from the right to the left side of the heart clear of the lungs. For this use is the foramen ovale, which is an opening of no inconsiderable size betwixt the right and left auricle of the heart; its area is as large as that of the vena cava; and it is suf- ficient, without the help of the ductus arteriosus, to convey the blood freely from right to left. S. The ductus arteriosus serves quite another purpose; for though the circulation of the aorta iswll maintained in the adult body by the force of one ven- tricle only, yet in the foetus one ventricle wi.l not Suffice. In the foetus the heart must push its blood not only through that system of vessels which is with- in the body, but also it must push it onwards through, a second circle of vessels, viz. those of the placenta; for the iliac arteries do n6t descend into the thigh and pelvis of the foetus, but the iliac artery itself, with little diminution (very small branches only be- ing given downwards into the pelvis and thigh), turns upwards along the side of the bladder; and these two arteries going out from the navel, form the umbilical cord; and the heart of the foetus has to give life and action not only to its own internal system, but to these two arteries comprehending the chief bulk of the aorta, which run out to the distance of three feet along the umbilical cord, and which make wonderful convolutions

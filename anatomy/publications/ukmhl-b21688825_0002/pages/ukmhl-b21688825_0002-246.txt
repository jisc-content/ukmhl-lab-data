1S2 CIRCULATION OF really strong. There is often left, after the closing of the valve, a small opening at its upper part. The valve closes soon after birth : the hole is so large, that this membrane forms a very large share of the parti- tion betwixt the auricles ; its transparency is such, compared with the rest of the walls, that it is as distinct in a boy, or in an adult, as in a foetus. This is the anatomy of the oval hole, and of its valve; and this proves, and any one who examines it will entirely be convinced, that the blood of the foetus passes through it from right to left*. * This heart of a foetus had all its parts cut away, except the ventricles (a a)—-the vena cava, with a blow-pipe in it (£)—and the wall or partition betw'ixt the auricles (c c)—which is here unfolded, to show the foiamen ovale. The musculi pectenati, or muscular fibres of the auricle, are well seen at (kk).—(d) Is the circle of the valve, the annulusToraminis ovalis.—(e) Is the valve itself.—(»') Is the small opening in the upper part of the valve, where the valve falls slack, and ready to open.—^m) Is one of the tricuspid valves, or of those valves

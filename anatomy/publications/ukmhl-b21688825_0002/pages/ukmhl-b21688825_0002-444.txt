576 OF THE BR'ACHIAL ARTERY, 2. ARTERIA PROFUNDA HUMERI INFERIOR YEJL MINOR. The lesser profunda, or the lower muscular ar- tery, is so named because it resembles the former in al- most all points. It is smaller, being not half the size (viz. of a crow-quill), and goes off, in general, about two inches lower down the arm. Its course, also, is exactly similar, except in this, that it is single, does not divide into two branches *, it gives twigs to the muscles of the arm ; runs down to the inner condyle, and after touching it, makes a sudden and serpentine turn, by which it gets upon the back part of the elbow-joint. Its chief inosculations are with the upper profunda, and with the recurrens interossea upon the back part of the joint. Betwixt the upper and lower profunda there gene- rally is sent off that artery which is to nourish the bone. It is named arteria nutritia humeri â€¢> but is not of sufficient importance to be numbered among the main branches of the artery. The nutritious ar- tery sends off small branches, or rather small twigs, to the brachialis, or that muscle which lies under the^ bi- ceps and to the triceps; and it perforates the bone about its middle in one larger artery, and sometimes there are also one or two smaller ones. 3. ramus anastomoticus major. The greater anastomosing artery is one of three or four which anastoqiose round the elbow- joint :

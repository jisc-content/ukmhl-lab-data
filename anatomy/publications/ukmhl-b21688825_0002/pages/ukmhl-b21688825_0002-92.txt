OF THE ACTION 44 pulsifica, its pulsative faculty as if they had said, the jaws chew by their mandicative faculty, and the bladder pisses by its expulsive faculty, and the womb expels children by its parturient power. The ancients, I have said, often opened Jiving crea^ tures, and saw the heart struggling to relieve itself because it was oppressed with blood: dais blood is itself the stimulus which moves the whole; for important as this function is, it is equally simple with all the others : and as urine is the stimulus to the bladder, food, an excitement to the intestines, and the full grown foetus a stimulus to the womb!—so.is blood the true stimulus to the heart. When the blood rushes into the heart, the heart is, excited and acts; when it has expelled that blood, it lies quiescent for a time ; when blood rushes in anew, it is roused again: so natural is both the incessant action and regular alter- nation of contraction and relaxation in the heart. It is when we are so cruel as to open a living crea- ture that we see best both the operation of the blood as a stimulus, and the manner in which the heart re- acts upon it. When we tie the two vena cavas so as to prevent the blood from arriving at the heart, the heart stops when we slacken our ligatures and let in the blood, it moves again ; when we tic the aorta, the left ventricle being full of blood will continue struggling, bending, turning up its apex, and con- tracting incessantly and strongly, and will continue this struggle long after the other parts have lost their powers. One author, whether from his awkwardness or the delicacy of the subject, or really from, the ■strength of the ventricle, assures us, that often while he

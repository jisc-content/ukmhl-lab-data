OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 269 over the angle of the jaw at that point where we feel it beating strongly ; and then mounting upon the face, begins to give a new set of arteries. 1. A branch to the masseter muscle; for the labial artery passes over the jaw, and up the face, just at the fore edge of the masseter muscle; and this branch inosculates with a twig descending over the surface of the masseter from the temporal artery. 2. The labial artery ascending in the hollowest part of the cheek, and lying flat upon the buccinator muscle, gives out small branches to it, which inosculate chiefly with the transversalis faciei, another branch, and a very great one, coming from the temporal artery across the face. Here also the main artery has still a very serpentine line, on account of the continual motions of the part. 3. Before the artery comes to that point where it is to give off the coronary artery of the lower lip, it gives a branch named labialis inferior ; which artery belongs to the lower part of the lower lip: its branches go to the triangularis and quadratus muscles, which lie on the chin and on the side of the chin, and also to the lower part of the orbicularis oris. This branch inosculates particularly with a twig, which comes from within the lower jaw through the mental hole, and with its fellow, and of course with the coronary arteries which run immediately above it, viz. in the red part of the lip. The artery now divides into two branches, one for each lip, named the coronary arteries, because they always surround the lips entirely, though their manner of going off is not, perfectly regular. The lower

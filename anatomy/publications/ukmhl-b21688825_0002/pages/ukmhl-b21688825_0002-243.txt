THE FOETUS. 119 N 2 valve y putes about the nature of this opening* or its valve. This is a subject which disputes may perplex, bat cannot explain. Another reason which I have for declining such controversies, is this: It is an easy matter to impose upon a whole academy, easier by far than upon one ingenious man: and thus it came to pass that in the French Academy each theorist brought dissections of tlie heart and foramen ovale suited to his own doctrines; each, when convenient, changed his ground a little, and brought new dissections; and thus valves and auricles, foetal and adult hearts, double Cats and human monsters, made their annual exhi- bitions in the halls of the French Academy: the Society never sickened nor tired, and the raree-show lasted exactly one hundred years. What kind of doctrines were current at such a time it is almost superfluous to explain; yet I think it not amiss to remark two examples, of obduracy on the one hand, and of ingenuity on the other, in two of the greatest men. Mr. Mery had conceived notions about the circulation of the blood in the foetus, which can hardly be explained* ; but it was one point essential to his doctrine, that the blood in the foetus moved directly from the left auricle to the right. He was forced to deny that the foramen ovale had a * All that can be done towards the explaining it in one word is this : He “ fancied that the right cavity of the heart was so large, and the left so small, that always the left side was obliged to dis- gorge again upon the right side ; and this was the meaning of the blood rushing through the foramen ovale from the left side to the right.”

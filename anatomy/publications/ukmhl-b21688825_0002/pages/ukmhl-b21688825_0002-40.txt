OF THE MECHANISM 2 right side a quantity of blood equal to that which is at each pulsation driven out from the left. The heart is placed betwixt the arteries and the veins, to regulate and enforce their action ; to receive the blood from the veins by a slow dilatation, and to restore, by a sudden contraction, that force which the blood loses in passing round the circle of the body. But the heart has also another and more important office to perform ; for by having two great cavities and two orders of vessels, it performs in the same instant two circulations, one for the lungs and one for the body; it receives from the lungs nothing but pure blood, it delivers out to the body nothing but what is fit for its uses : and this puri- fying or oxydation of the blood, and this excitement of the arteries, are two chief points of modern physi- ology, which every step of the following demonstration will tend to explain. It will be most easy to conceive at first the idea of a more simple heart, of one circle, of one simple circula- tion ; of one bag for receiving, and another joined to it for propelling, the blood. Indeed a heart consists merely of these essential parts ; a great vein, an auricle, a ventricle, and a great artery *. of a vein which returns the blood from all the body; of an auricle or smaller bag, which receives that blood and retains it till the action of the heart is relaxed; of a ventricle (which is. the proper heart), strong, muscular, very irritable, and easily excited, into which the auricle pours its blood j of an artery which is allied to the ventricle in strength and action 'as the auricle is to the vein in the delicacy of its coats), and which carries on the blood to the ex- tremities of the body:â€”and the vein and artery meet- ing

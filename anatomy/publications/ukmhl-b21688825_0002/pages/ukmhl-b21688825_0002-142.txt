00 OF THE BLOOD, $o, the loss of a promising young man. Falconer thought he saw these globules, not as spheres but as flattened spheres; he thought he saw them often as ^hey rolled down the inclined plane upon which he placed them, turning their edges, their sides, their faces, towards the eye; he even compared their flat- ness with that of a coin. Many authors have con- jectured that these globules are compressed when they come into narrow passages, and expand again when they get into wider arteries. This Reichell says he has seen, and Blumenbach believes; but Biumenbach, less easy of belief with regard to all these strange forms ascribed to the particles of the blood, pronounces his dissent in plain terms, “ They appear,” says he, “ to my eye no other than simple globules, apparently of mucus: that lenticular or oval form which authors speak of, I have not seen.” The following are their chief properties with re-? gard to the rest of the blood. When blood stands, they fall to the bottom, because they are heavier than the other parts of the blood; and although the gluten entangles them while it is forming, still it is to be no- ticed that the cake is always redder at the bottom; and when by weakness or disease this coagulation is very slow, some globules escape the grasp of the coagu- lum, and the serum is tinged with red, and the cake, though coloured at the' bottom, is white at the top, or has the bully coat. Their form they preserve only while in the blood, and seem to be supported more by the qualities of the serum than by their own pro- perties; for if mixed with water, they mix easily, and totally dissolve; the water is red, but the globules are g°ne;

873 OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. III. OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. The brachial artery is that division of the artery which is marked by the tendon of the great pectoral muscle ; for as that is the fore border of the axilla, all d ' ' , i.i above that is axillary, and all below it brachial artery, down to the bend of the arm, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. The brachial arfery # runs close along the os humeri on its inner side, here Â® the bone is most naked ; and this i^the line^n which ' we feel the artery beating, and apply the cushion^pff the tourniquet. To describe, as some authors have done, each insig- nificant and nameless branch which thif^artery gives off, were to make a simple matter intricate beyond all enduring. The whole matter is this: As the artery goes downwards, lying exactly on the inner side of the arm bone, and directly in the middle betwixt the bi- ceps on the fore part and the triceps behind, it gives frequent branches to each. Those going to the biceps are short, small, pretty regular, and exceedingly like each other all the way down the arm; and they are thus frequent, and very short, in consequence of the artery adhering closer to the sides of the biceps. Not one of them can be distinguished, or is worth naming. Those which it sends downwards to the triceps are (in consequence of that being a large muscle, with se- veral thick and fleshy origins) both longer and more tortuous, and more important; and they accordingly B b 3 have

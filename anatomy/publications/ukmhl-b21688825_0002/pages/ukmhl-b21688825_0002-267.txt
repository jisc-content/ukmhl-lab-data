THE HEART. 203 any hole In the septum betwixt the ventricles of the heart; if the pulmonic artery do not admit the blood, now that the child is born, and should breathe the air ; if the aorta arise from the right ventricle, so as to carry off all the blood from the lungs; or if the aorta be so displaced, that its mouth stands in part over both ventricles, so as to receive the blood of bothâ€”then the organization, movements, functions of the heart; are all wrong; no blood passes into the lungs, the child cannot live; it either dies immediately in convulsive struggles, or lives in misery but a few years. It is not in this rapid enumeration that these va- rieties of malconformation can be understood, nor yet do they deserve to be minutely detailed. I shall keep - the middle path ; and those of my readers will easily follow me who have studied the mechanism of the heart ; concerning which this subject will recal to their memory all the important facts. The most usual of all these disorders of the heart is some fault in the pulmonic artery; and that disorder again is fruitful of others: for if the pulmonic artery cannot receive its blood, the foramen ovale cannot close: then the blood cannot circulate nor pass into the lungs when they first expand; then the office of the right heart is taken away, it has no power but to drive the blood with struggles through the foramen ovale into the left heart; the left heart then drives this blood, unoxydated as it is, into the aorta: the heart is now a single heart; it is the left heart alone that receives or circulates the blood : either it labours bat for a few pulses, and then the child, after a con- vulsive

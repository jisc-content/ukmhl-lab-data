OF THE HEART. 46 lie has held the aorta of a Frog close with pincers, it has burst by the mere force of the heart. If, after violent struggles of this kind, you cut the aorta, even of so small a creature as an Eel, it will throw its blood to the distance of three or four inches. Thus we not only know that we can excite the heart by accumulating blood in it, but that by con- fining the blood in it we can carry that excitement to a very high degree ; and in short, by keeping the one or the other ventricle incessantly full of blood, we can make the one heart work continually* while the other lies quiet, or is only slightly drawn by the otherâ€™s motion, showing the true distinction betwixt the heart of the body and the heart of the lungs. And this is a memorable fact, that it is not merely the stimulus of the blood, but the sense of fulness that makes the heart contract; for the auricle often beats twice or thrice, sometimes it makes its push four or five times, before it can force the ventricle to contract. When we empty the heart, and tie all its veins, all its parts cease to act ; stimuli applied outwardly make it contract partially; it trembles in particular fibres : but it is only letting in the blood, or blowing it up with air, that can bring it into full action again. When we look with cruel deliberation upon the strokes of the heart in any living creature, we observe that at first, during the full and rapid action of the heart, there is hardly any perceptible interval among the several parts ; but towards the end of each experiment, when the pulse flags, and the creature falls low, the swelling of the great veins, and the successive strokes of auricle and ventricle, are distinctly told* The dh latation

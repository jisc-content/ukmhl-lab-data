OF THE MECHANISM 22 seen here* (ss):—Now it is to be remembered that the left auricle is smaller than the right, that the cir- cle or opening of the left auricle is of course smaller than that of the right; that while it requires a valve divided into three points to fill the opening of the right auricle, a valve divided only into two points suf- fices for the opening of the left auricle : this is the rea- son of this slight variety of shape betwixt the two au- ricular valves, and is also the reason of the valve of the right side being called tricuspid or three-pointed, while this of the left side, from some very slight re- semblance to a mitre, is named valvula mitr ai t-, the mitral valve. In all other points this valve is the same with that of the right side,it has the same apparent thinness, for it is even transparent, the same real strength, the same columns carneae and tendinous strings to support it; the same rough irregular surface towards the opening of the auricle ; the same smooth gutter leading towards the artery. The constitution of all these parts, in short, is expressly the same ; so that even concerning the left ventricle there is no- thing further to be observed, but that while it is much longer than the right ventricle, it is much small- er in its whole cavity, is much stronger in its co- LUMNiE carnet, and much thicker in its fleshy walls, as at (tt)—Where it is seen to be thicker than the right ventricle, it is indeed nearly three times as thick. * This begins the description of the left side of the Heart, and the description follows the Plan, N° 6. 11.

of the leg and foot. 489 near the lower end of the tibia in inosculations with the peroneal artery. Other nameless muscular arteries succeed to this, going to the tibialis posticus, to the flexor communis, and to the flexor of the great toe. When the artery arrives near the ankle-joint, it gives many small twigs to the periosteum, tendons, sheaths, and bursas mu- cosae behind the ankle ; and then passing in the very deepest part of the ankle, under the annular ligament, and betwixt the tibia or process of the inper ankle and the heel-bone, it adheres closely to the bones and cap- sule of the joint; and there gives a great many little tortuous arteries, making net-works over this joint and its bones, as over the other joints already described. But especially two delicate arteries go out at this hollow at the side of the heel-bone : one forwards to- wards the side of the ankle-joint, the other downwards and backwards over the heel-bone, which ramify very profusely and very beautifully. The artery now lying deep under the abductor magnus of the great toe, which arises from the heei- bone, forks into its two great branches, the external and internal plantar arteries. ARTERIA PLANTARIS INTERNA. The internal plantar artery is much the smaller branch, not to be compared in importance (though their names are contrasted) with the exter- nal plantar artery; and it is named internal, because as it runs along the sole of the foot it keeps to the inner edge, viz. that to which the great toe belongs. It comes off under the head of the abductor of the great

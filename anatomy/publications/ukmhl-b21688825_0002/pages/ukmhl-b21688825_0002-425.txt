of the axillary artery. 3,59 protected ; then it falls over the breast iii a very oblique direction; it inclines outwards towsiids the axilla, lies flat upon the slanting convexity of the chest, is covered by the pectoral muscles, because the pectoral muscles arise from the clavicle, under which the artery passes; but far from being protected, it is so far exposed as to be easily felt beating, and it is at this point only that it can be rightly compressed. It declines still outwards and downwards, till at last it gets so deep into the arm-pit, and so much under the scapula, as to lie betwixt the serratus anticus and subscapular muscles. There it is rightly called the axillary artery In this hollow it lies safe, protected by the deep borders of the pectoral muscle before, and of the latissimus dorsi behind, surrounded with fat and glands, inclosed within the meshes of the plexus, or great con- junction of nerves, which go to the arm, surrounded also by all the veins of the arm, which twine round it in a wonderful manner. Here it gives off the thoracic arteries to the thorax, and theâ€™ scapular arteries to the shoulder. In short, the axilla itself is a com- plicated study; but in all that respects the arteries it may be made very easy and plain. But let the surgeon remember that it is only by a perfect knowledge of the arteries, a bold stroke of the knife, and a masterly use of the needle, that the patient is to be saved from bleedings after wounds hereabouts! for the old story of compressing the axillary artery above the clavicle is now of no credit with any surgeon of knowledge or good sense. As the artery turns over the borders of the chest, it gives one or tv/o twigs to the adjacent parts, A a 4 as

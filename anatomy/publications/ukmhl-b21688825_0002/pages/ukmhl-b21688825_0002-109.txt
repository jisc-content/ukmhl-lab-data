OF THE HEART. 57 it is lubricated, supported and regulated in its motions, by the pericardium ; its nerves, which remain to be explained at a fitter time, are extremely small, while its vis insita, or irritability, is great beyond that of all the other parts. - We can easily follow the circle of the blood, which, as it arrives from all the extremities in ritates the auricle, is driven down into the ventricle, is forced thence into the pulmonic artery, pervades the lungs, and then comes round to the left side of the heart, or to that heart which supplies the body; and there begins a new circulation, called the greater cir- culation, viz. of the body, as the other is called the lesser circulation of the lungs. Thus we recognise distinctly the functions of the double heart, with all its mechanism ; the stronger heart to serve the body, the weaker heart to serve the lungs; and we see in the plainest manner two distinct functions performed by one compound heart: the right heart circulates the blood in the lungs, where it is purified and renewed; the left delivers out a quantity of blood, not such as to fill all the vessels, nor such as to move onwards by this single stroke of the heart to the very extremities of the body, but such merely as to give a sense of fulness and tension to the vessels : the force is merely such as to excite and support that action which the arteries every where perform in the various organs of the body, each artery for its appropriated purposes, and each in its peculiar degree. By understanding thus the true mechanism and uses of the heart, we can conceive how the ancients weFe led into strange mistakes, by very simple and natural, appearances. We understand why Galen called the right

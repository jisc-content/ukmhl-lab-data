OF RESPIRATION. 15? this single heart, and therefore the whole mass circu- lates, parcel by parcel, through the gills, for every time that it circulates through the body. We shall begin its circulation, then, at the heart. First, The whole blood of the body is returned into the heart of a Skate, for example, by two great veins [aa)—These two great veins deliver it into a vast auricle, or reser- voir rather, which lies over the heart {b b)—The au- ricle delivers it into a strong ventricle (c)—whose ac- tion is further strengthened by the action of its aorta, which from the heart up to {d),—where the valves are, is very muscular and powerful, and constitutes, in a manner, a part of the heart. But this great vessel must in this species of circulation change its name, for it really is not an aorta, has nothing to do with the body: both the heart of a fish, and this its only vessel, belong entirely to the lungs or gills, and as these are called the bronchias, this is the bronchial artery. The gills of this fish are five in number on each side, and on each side the bronchial artery gives out two branches (e and f)~which serve the five gills :—(<?) the lower branch is large, and serves the three lower gills—(/) the higher branch, which goes off like one of the arms of a cross, serves the two upper gills. Secondly, These arteries being distributed along the gills, divide into exquisitely small branches produ- cing that feathery appearance which is so beautiful. Those minute subdivisions of the bronchial vessels ex- pose the blood to the air. This may explain to us how in the human lungs the exposing of the blood, even with the interposition of membranes and of the arterial

OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. 315 when the arteries are dissected away. One of these transverse arteries, longer than the rest, looks like ano- ther posterior cerebri. It goes to the seventh pair, or auditory nerve, in the following way: The seventh pair of nerves proceeds from the back part of the pons Varolii; and as it goes forwards, the two nerves which it consists of, viz. the poitiodura and theportio mol- lis, are separated from each other by a small and very beautiful artery which shoots in betwixt them, and en- ters along with them into the ear. The basilar artery also gives twigs to the fifth and sixth pairs of nerves which arise from the fore part of the pons, as the se- venth pair arises from behind. Arrived at the fore part of the pons Varolii, the vertebral artery gives off almost at one point four great arteries, two to the right hand and two to the left. These are the anterior cerebelli and the posterior ce- rebri. 2. ANTERIOR cerebelli. The anterior artery of the cerebellum, or the upper artery as it is called, goes off at right angles from the basilar artery, and bends round the crura ce- rebri to get to the cerebellum. It gives its branches first to the crura cerebelli, to the cerebellum, and to the vermis. Secondly, There is a greater artery go- ing over all the upper part of the cerebellum, (where it lies under the brain), and also another which keeps closer to the brain than to the cerebellum, branches over that velum or delicate part of the pia mater which is interposed betwixt the cerebellum and brain; and

222 DISEASES OF Morgagni expresses it, a liver-like, solid consistence ; they have no longer the cellular appearance of lungs, for their branchiae are crammed with blood; their common cellular texture is also full of exuded blood ; they are dense, solid, very heavy, and black, and they sink in water like the lungs of a foetus. The heart is so curbed in its actions, that it gives but a small, feeble, and trembling pulseand even in a few days (as in the foetus having an imperfect organization) the heart is wonderfully dilated and enlarged, and filled with fluid and grumous blood. Haller laments the death of friends by this terrible disease, and espe- cially of his own son, “ whose body he gave to be opened by those skilled in dissections.” Perhaps the heart may be too small for the system to which it belongs ; and this, I doubt not, had been the case with that boy in whom Kerkringius found it so small, that though the boy was nine years old, the heart (/. e. the ventricles) was no bigger than that of a foetus; and the whole heart, auricles, ventricles and all, was no bigger than that of a child born at the full time. But in proportion as the heart was small the vessels were large, not at all aneurismal, but of such a size, and scarcely of such a size, as might suit the heart of a boy of nine years old. This boy had for five years been hectic, that is to say, he had been troubled with no formed disease, but with continual distress, anxiety, weakness, and quick pulse. This heart was plainly inadequate to the functions of any system ; but the case is too slightly sketched for us to find any decided marks of ill oxydated blood. But

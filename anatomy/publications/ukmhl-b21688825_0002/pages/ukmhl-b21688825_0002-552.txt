4S0 OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY. crucial ligament, the semilunar cartilages, and the fat about the back of the joint. LOWER ARTICULAR ARTERIES. The lower articu'ar arteries are more slender, longer run downwards very low, and return upwards with a very sudden angle. ARTER1A ART1CULARIS INFERIOR EXTERNA. The external articular artery below the knee goes off from the popliteal at the middle or centre of the joint, turns downwards along with the popliteal artery for a considerable way; it passes under the heads of the small plantar muscle and the outer head of the gastrocnemius, and having passed through, en- counters the head of the fibula, and passes above it to the side of the joint, spreading its branches towards the patella. In the ham this artery gives muscular branches to the heads of the muscles, as of the gastrocnemius, solasus, plantaris, and the popliteal muscle, that muscle which lies obliquely across the ham. When it reaches to the side of the joint, it passes under the external la- teral ligament; and several of its branches, besides their external anastomoses, go into the cavity of the joint, one of which within the joint is especially large. ARTERIA ARTICCLARIS INFERIOR INTERNA. The internal articular artery below the knee is larger than the external one. Like it, it bends down- wards, passes under the inner head of the gastrocne- mius

342 ARTERIES OF THE ARM. twigs to the glands, the pectoral muscles, and the breast or mamma ; and on the other hand it gives off first great articular arteries which surround the joint, and still great scapular arteries which surround the scapula, and nourish all that great mass of flesh which lies upon it. 3. But when this artery takes the name of the humeral artery, and passes along the arm, it must be simple, as the arm is simple; for it consists of a bone of one mass of muscles before and another behind: the artery of course runs along the bone undivided, except that it gives off one branch, which runs parallel along with the main artery, and which running deeper among the flesh, is named muscularis or profunda. 4. It divides at the bend of the arm, in order to pass into the forearm in three great branches. In wounds thus low, all danger of loosing the arm from wounds of the artery, unless by the gross ignorance or fault of the surgeon, is over: we do not attend so much to the parts which it supplies, or, in other words, to its inosculations, as to the parts against which the great branches lie. We observe here, as on all occasions, the. artery seeking protection, and running upon the firmest parts: its three branches now pass ; one along the radius, another along the ulna, a third along the interrosseous membrane. 5. in the palm of the hand we find the artery still following the order of the bones; and as the carpal bones are as a center or nucleus, upon which the metacarpal and finger-bones stand like radii, the palmar artery forms a complete arch, from which all the

THE FOETUS. 17« But my third plan explains the adult liver as if these branches had never existed. The two first plans show what are its veins in the foetus. This third plan shows what are its proper and permanent veins; for those pe- culiar veins which wTe find in the child are accommoda- tions for the foetus, are ranked among the peculiarities of the foetus, and are, when the child is born oblite- rated by a new circulation j and what is very curious, by a circulation which goes through the same vessels in a retrograde course. In this third plan I represent the liver of the adult; I consider only the vena portae, which is its proper vein, and I give the vein and the liver it- self a new and more simple form. This plan is drawn from an adult liver, most of its substance being dissected away.—[a) Marks the right lobe— the left—(c) the Lobulus Spigelii. These are sufficient to mark the more important points, and I have not spared the substance of the liver in other parts where vessels were to be shown.—(d) Is the shape of the vena portae tied after injection, and cut short and twisted a little so as to make it stand al- most perpendicularly—[e] and (/) are the two great lateral branches going to the right and left sides of the liver; and this cylindrical part of this very great vein is called the sinus of the vena portae. It is so formal, lies so fairly at right angles with the Vena portae, goes so regularly into two equal limbs, the branches too, even when spreading in the liver, are so formal, that it iooks mere like a piece of human mechanism than any thing belonging to the living body: it appears so here, not from the stiff Ind awk- ward

155 OF RESPIRATION. arterial coats, may be sufficient for the oxydation of the blood. All the blood thus oxygenated is returned by veins, corresponding exactly in number and ar- rangement with their arteries; and the heart being turned aside, as in figure 2. and all the other viscera taken out, the veins are seen accompanying their ar- teries and emerging from the gills at (ggg)—and they are seen at (h —to form the aorta. Thirdly, The aorta (/)—is formed by the veins of the gills, and the veins of the gills lie close upon the skull of the fish, and the aorta upon the back-bone ; and this vessel is in one sense a vein, since it is a continuation of those veins which return the blood bf the gills ; but both in office and form it is a true aorta; in office, because it distributes blood to the whole body ; and in form, because it no sooner swells out into the shape of an aorta than its coats grow hard, strong, muscular, fit for its office, while those of the veins from which it is formed are pellucid, de- licate, and very tender. The aorta is full of the oxy- dated blood of the gills ; and although, by the deli- cate circulation of the gills, it has lost all communica- tion with the heart, it circulates this oxydated blood through the body to all the muscles, glands, viscera, he. without the intervention of a new heart. The veins which return the blood of this aorta are the ordinary veins ; they arrive in two great branches at the heart, and need not b furt her explained. I will not be at the trouble to repeat the tedious calculations of authors concerning the immense sur- face which the gills expose : Let the student look to the gills, and he will presently, with the help of this short

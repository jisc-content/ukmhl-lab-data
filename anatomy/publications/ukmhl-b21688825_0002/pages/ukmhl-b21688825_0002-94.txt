46 of the Action iatation and contraction of each part is what we can- not observe, they are so quick ; but these things we distinctly observe: The auricle contracts and dilates the ventricle; the ventricle contracts, subsides, and fills the aorta ; the aorta turns and twists with the force of the blood driven into it, and by its own re-action, and the ventricle, every time that it contracts, assumes a form slightly curved, the point turning up like a tongue towards the basis, and the basis in some degree bending towards the point. The basis, indeed, is in some degree fixed to the diaphragm and spine, but the heart in its contraction always moves upon its basis as upon a centre ; its ventricles, and especially its apex, are free; the point rises and curves so as to strike against the ribs ; and the dilatation of the heart is such (together with the posture and relation of its several parts), that during the dilatation the heart turns upon its axis one way ; the contraction of the heart reverses this, and makes it turn the other way, so that it seems to work perpetually with the turning motions of a screw. All this is most striking, while we are looking upon the motion of the heart in a living creature. The posture of the human heart is very Singular, and will illustrate this turning motion extremely well; for in the human heart the posture is so distorted, that no one part has that relation to another which we should beforehand expect. In the general system, the human heart is placed nearly in the centre, but not for those reasons which Dionis has assigned ; it is not in order ihat by being in the centre it may feel less the difficulty of driving the blood to any particular limb'

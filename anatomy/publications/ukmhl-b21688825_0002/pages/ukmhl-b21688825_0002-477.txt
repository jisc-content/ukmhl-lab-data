OF THE ABDOMEN. 409 tined chiefly for the viscera, they have no other way of reaching the viscera than by taking the direction of the several branches which the abdominal aorta gives out. There are three great branches ; the coeliac, the superior mesenteric, and the inferior mesenteric arte- ries. Of course there are three great plexus of nerves ; the coeliac plexus, the superior mesenteric plexus, and the inferior mesenteric plexus. As these net works all come from the greater net-work which covers the aorta itself, that plexus is named, from its great size and from its many radiated nerves, the solar plexus ; and the semilunar form of the two great nerves which supply the whole gives them the name of semilunar ganglions. These connecsions of the aorta, deduced in this ge- neral way, will be easily understood; will show the importance of studying this point, where there are so many intricate parts; and will explain also the ne- cessity of mentioning this group of difficult parts at once. The aorta then passes from the thorax into the ab- domen, through betwixt the legs of the diaphragm; the beginning of the thoracic duct lies a little below this point, and the duct itself runs up by the side of the aorta; the great Splanchenic nerve, or that which goes to the bowels, attaches itself as soon as it enters the abdomen to the side of the aorta, and swells out into the semilunar ganglion or knot; So that the semilunar ganglion of each Splanchenic nerve lies along each side of the aorta ; the smaller nerves which these ganglions give out meet across the root of the abdo- minal aorta, to form the solar plexus ; and next the coeli&c

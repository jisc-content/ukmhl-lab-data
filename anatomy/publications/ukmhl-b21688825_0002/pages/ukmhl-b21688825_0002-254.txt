One shi uid have thought that rhe folly of this opi- nion would have appeared more striking in proportion to the earnestness of these arguments, and that no sub- sequent author would have deigned to honour such an opinion so tar even as to notice it: but behold the celebrated Haller not only adopts this notion very fully, but enriches it with further explanations, saying, “ that the vessels are all, during the contraction of the lungs, forced into numerous angles and joint-like folds; that the angles are made even, and the passages of the blood more direct upon the expansion of the lungs.” As if, forsooth, the lungs (which, as I shall presently demonstrate, scarcely move in respiration) folded and closed upon each other like the wings of a Butterfly or Beetle*. Santorini also represents the vessels of the lungs as thus collapsed, plaited, and folded a thou- sand various ways “ assaisse et replie de mille manieres differents, &c.” —“ One effect of expiration (says Haller) is so to compress all the arteries of the lungs, that they cannot receive the blood from the ventricle of the heart so freely as they are wont to do f. * “ Prasterea, in vivo animale, cujus cor contrahitur, et in arterias pulmonales sanguinem data vi emittit, omnino nunc sanguis in eas arterias facilius, atque adeo celerius irrumpit, postquam deletus re- tardatricibus plicis, recta nunc sunt.J> ■{- Verum alter effectus expirationis est utique pulmonis arterias ita comprimere, ut ce pari facilitate sanguinem a suo cordis ventri- culo recipiani. « It

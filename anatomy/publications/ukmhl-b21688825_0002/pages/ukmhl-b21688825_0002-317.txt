Vasalva, Van Swieten, Pechlinus, Lower and especially Drel- lincartms in his Experimenta Canicidia, and many others, spent days and weeks in tying up the carotids of Dogs. What does all this imply ?'Surely a strong belief in tales which would disgrace the Arabian Nights; tales concerning a manner of tying a cord round the neck of a SheTgoat, or even of a young Man, so that, without hurting them, they should be made to sleep or wake, according to the bidding of the spectators.

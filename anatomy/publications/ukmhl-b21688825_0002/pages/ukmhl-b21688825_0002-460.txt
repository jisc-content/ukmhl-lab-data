392 Â©F THE ARTEJtlES tery is about to turn over to the back of the hand; it passes in general through the flesh of the thumb, gor- ing under the root of abductor brevis pollicis. This artery we generally find dividing into three branches: The first is a more superficial branch, which crosses the palm of the hand, and gives its twigs to the skin, palmar aponeurosis, annular liga- ment, and all the tendinous parts about the joint: The second is a larger and more important branch ; it is the middle branch of these three; it goes deep; and having given several branches to the muscles about the root of the thumb, and to one or two of the interossei muscles, it makes a large inosculation with the great palmar arch, which seems to be indeed the chief ten- dency of the whole artery : The third branch is less regular than the others; it mounts along the. root of the thumb, and belongs to its outer edge*. The next branches of the radial artery are very small and nameless twigs, which go the naked part of the wrist, to the tendons, ligaments, and the bones; and then comes the artery opposite to this artery of the palm, viz. the artery of the back of the hand. ARTERIA DORSALIS CARPI. The artery of the back of the hand comes of from the radial, just after it has turned over the root * This branch anatomists have thought fit to call arteria ulna- ria radial i s pollicip, which involves such a complication of contra- dictions, that, upon reading it, one would naturally turn to the tables of errata. The artery is called radialis, because it comes from the radial artery ; and ulnaris pollicis, because it goes upon the ulnar side of the thumb. of

OF RESPIRATION, 144- lungs, .which lie close to the back-bone—-At ( i i ) is seen on with little. In short, there are two functions to be per* formed in birds: First, the oxydation of the blood, which is performed by the small, fleshy, contracted lungs, which lie immoveable in the upper part of the thorax, and through which the air blows continually as through a furnace, while they are quite passive: and, secondly, The lightening of their bodies for fly- ing*, which is performed by the abdominal cells 3 and the confounding of the abdominal cells with the true lungs, and the describing of a diaphragm where none can be, was like to have put us all wrong f. * Although I say the lightening the bird for flying, I do n'ot mean to aflirm absolutely, that it is either for flying, that they are made light; for I have given, on the contrary, an example in a bird which seldom flies, viz. the common fowl; and I have added a plan of the Ostrich’s cells, which is a swift footed bird, and never flies: nor do I even affirm, that it is for the sake of light- ness that these cells are thus provided. Perhaps one chief use is blowing through the true lungs to oxygenate the blood; yeti should think lightness were a chief use, for the cells are far too large for this office alone of ventilating the lungs: and they are s© diffused as to enter even into the bones of fowls, where the air is so freely admitted, that if you break a bone which has such an air cell in it, for example the shoulder-bone of a fowl, you produce an emphysema. •f- Plans of the Respiration of Birds. In the first Plan is seen—(a) The treachea dividing inte branches—(£) The heart sending great pulmonic arteries to the lungs—The true lungs shaped like the human, but ex- ceedingly smal', dense, and bloody—(d.) The thin and delicate membrane, which forms a mediastinum—(e) The great air cell in which the heart lay—(f) The cell where the stomach lay— (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) A number of cells, very large, which sur- round all the viscera, and fill the whole abdomen—(6, 6,) Two large cells which lie nearest the true lungs—(gj) The true

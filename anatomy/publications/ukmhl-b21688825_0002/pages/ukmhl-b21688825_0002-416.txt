350 OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. the diaphragm. From this destination it is sometimes named the ramus musculo-phrenicus. 2. ARTERIA THYROIDEA INFERIOR. *\ The lower thyroid artery, whose branches go to the neck, the shoulder, and the thyroid gland, arises from the fore part of the subclavian artery, close upon the origin of the internal mammary. It is there covered by the root of the mastoid muscle. It buds out from the root of the great ax illary artery, in the form ofa short thick stump, which immediately divides whip-like into four small and slender arteries. 1. The main branch of this artery is again named the ramus thyroideus arteriae thyroideae. This thyroid artery is the first great branch; it does not ascend directly, but moves a little inwards towards the trachea, from which the root is a good deal re- moved 3 it bends behind the carotid artery, is tortu- ous, ascends by the side of the trachea till it touches the lower lobe of the thyroid gland; it spreads upon it like a hand, inosculates very freely with the upper thyroid artery, and nourishes the gland. This branch moreover gives some twigs upwards to the lower con- strictors of the pharynx and to the oesophagus ; but its chief arteries, beside those which plunge into the gland, are its tracheal arteries. These tracheal arteries, two or three in number, are reflected along the trachea, turn down with it into the chest, and reach even to the bifurcation of the trachea, where, inosculating with the intercostal arteries, they form a most beautiful net-work. 2.

SSI THE ARTERIES. the glut/e al, a very great artery, turns round the bone, goes out by the sciatic notch, and goes to the glutaeal muscles. The sciatic, almost equally large, turns down along the hip opoosite to the glutseal, which turns up. The pudic, of great size, also turns out of the pelvis, turns inwards again towards the root of the penis, and belongs entirely to the private parts, as its name implies. EXTERNAL ILIACS. The external iliac, when it passes out of the abdomen, takes the name of femoral artery: it divides into two vast arteries a little below theligament of the thigh: the one goes deep, belongs to the mus- cles, is called the profunda ; it furnishes all the thigh, and it might with the strictest propriety be named the femoral artery. The femoral artery, as we call it, is the other great branch, which continues superficial, runs obliquely down the fore part of the thigh, gives few and but trivial branches to the thigh, and is really destined for the leg. "When the artery turns inwards towards the ham, it is named popliteal artery; and, like the artery at the bend of the arm, this one at the bending of the knee divides into three great branches, which, like thoseofthearm, take their names from the bones along which they run; the anterior tibial artery lies on the fore part of the tibia; the posterior tibial artery runs along the back part of the tibia; the fibvlar artery runs along the fibula; and these great arteries terminate by making arches with each other in the solÂ® of the foot, in the same

OF RESPIRATION, 165 internal parts; the mouth, the anus, and especially all the respiratory tubes, lose an internal skin, at the same time that the old s in or slough is pushed off from the outward surface of the body ; and when the pun . ta are thus changed, they arc left more open than before, and often their number is changed. For the drawing of this slough or skin (o'-—from winch the W orm has just disengaged itself, and the old air-tubes (b) —inverted, and adhering to the cast skin, see figure 8. which is the figure of the Oossus, an affected name by which Mouffet and others have chosen to distinguish the Worm from which the Horned Beetle proceeds. These are the various ways by which insects are supplied with air; and nothing can be more interesting than to observe the vast proportion of air w.ich they draw in, as if they lived upon that element; the in- finite care with which Nature has guarded this main function in insects, ordaining so many various ways by which they may in some sense fib their system with air. The variety of ways is changed, and suited, as I have observe , to their various ways of life, and to the various conditions and stages of their life; while they are Worms, when they are involved foe- tuses, and when they have burst their shell and are full grown. In short. Worms, Aurelize, Ifies, Beetles, Bees, and all forms of insects, have all of them their tracheas by which they breathe a wonderfully large proportion of air. M 3 There

OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. 313 wards; it is forced to make a very sudden turn, and is quite exposed. When the artery has passed through the transverse process of the atlas, it makes another very sudden turn, lies flat upon the circle of that ver- tebra, so as to make a large hollowness or groove up- on the bone, and then it enters the foramen magnum by rising in a perpendicular direction ; and then again it bends and inclines forwards, laying hat along the cuneiform process of the occipital bone, where it soon meets its fellow, and the two uniting form the basilar artery. This basilar artery lies, with regard to the bone, up- on the cuneiform process of the os occipitis, and runs along it from the foramen magnum to the sella tur- cica; with regard to the brain, it lies upon that great tubercle which is named the tuber annulare or pons Varolii; as it lies upon the tuber annulare, it marks it with a large furrow; and as it goes along in one great trunk, it gives out from each side little arteries, which belong to this tuber annulare. These also make smaller furrows on its surface. The vertebral artery has, like the carotid, its three great branches. 1. ARTERIA CEREBELLI POSTERIOR. The posterior artery, or lower artery of the cerebellum, Is small and not regular. It comes off from the basilar artery either immediately after the pnion of the vertebrals, or from the vertebral artery immediately

4 OF THE MECHANISM from the livor of the face, from the sobbing and struggles of the chest, from the regular convulsive sighs of those creatures which are butchered, rather a desire for air than a want of blood. It is for the purpose of this second circulation that nature has ap- pointed in every breathing creature two^ hearts, a heart for the lungs, and a heart for the body; two veins, two auricles, two ventricles, and two great arte- ries, one the pulmonic artery, or artery of the lungs, the other the aorta, or artery of the body. But still there are other varieties which distinguish animals into creatures of cold or of warm blood; for there are certain constitutions which do not require that the blood should be thus continually renewed* It is not because animals are amphibious, or go into the water, that they have peculiar lungs; for the Land Tortoise, the Newt, theCameleon,never go intothewa- ter ; yet they have membranous lungs: nor indeed can the Amphibise, as the Seal, the Porpoise, the Sea. Lion, &c. dive longer than a man can do ; though for whole days they lie in herds basking upon the shore; it is their peculiar constitution to need less than other creatures the office of the lungs. The cold-blooded animals are generally creeping animals, sluggish, lan- guid, cold, inert, difficultly moved, and tenacious of life to a wonderful degree. They can bear all kinds of stimuli; they can bear to have their heads, legs, bowels, cut away; and among other peculiarities of this constitution, they can live long without air ; they will rise from time to time above water, if you allow them; they can bear again to be kept under water, if you force them: but if they can live long under wa.

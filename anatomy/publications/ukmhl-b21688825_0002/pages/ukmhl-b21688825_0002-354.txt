OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 290 and the smaller twigs pierce the outer tables of the skull, and go into the bone in great profusion for its nourishment. CONCLUSION. I r would surely be wrong to conclude the description of a system of arteries so important as this, without attempting to interest my reader in this piece of anatomy, by observing a few anatomical and surgical facts. That arteries are not tortuous to favour the exten- sion of parts, but rather because they have been extended and long pushed by the current of blood, is a fact very manifest to any one who considers the con- dition of many of these arteries which I have just de- scribed. When we first observe the thyroid, lingual, and labial arteries; when we consider that the tongue, the throat, the lips, are moveable and dilatable parts— we are apt to say that such arteries are tortuous to favour those motions. But when we remark the cur- ling form of the alveolar artery, where it lies against the back of the antrum ; of the occipital artery, where it lies firm against the bone; of the temporal, where it rises along the side of the head—we perceive clearly that this curling has nothing to do with dilatation. And Dr. Hunter’s observation of the arteries of the womb being tortuous, to allow of extension, is not like the observation of so great an anatomist, but of one who had not considered many of the chief arteries

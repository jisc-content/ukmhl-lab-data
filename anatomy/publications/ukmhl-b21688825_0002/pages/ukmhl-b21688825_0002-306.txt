242 DISEASES OF These, then, are the habits, in which it occurs, and this its cause: and there remains but two things to be shortly observed, or rather to be proved, viz. that it is sometimes as alarming as an organic disease is; and that bleeding is dangerous is an extreme degree, or at least that it does not, as Galen affirms, “ always bring relief/’ “ Sanctius Velasco, son of the Count Velasco, had a palpitation of the heart so terrible, that I and many by-standers often heard it distinctly, at if a stone had been plumped into a jug half full of water.*” Yet this boy got entirely well, and his physicians made themselves very happy in the thought that they had cured him, by a sacculus of aromatic herbs steeped in wine applied to the region of his heart; and by the same aromatics, or cardiacs as they called them, given along \frith his food. I prove the second point, viz. the danger of bleed- ing, by a most alarming case, delivered by Morgagni, which I fear might (if it had so pleased the writers) have had in the records of medicine many precedents; it wholly destroys the authority of Galen’s rule, and plainly instructs us never to bleed. “ A boarding- mistress, having a slighter palpitation of the heart, was bled with some appearance of relief: but after two days her palpitations returned with such violence, that the breast seemed at every siroke to be lifted up; she had withal pain, fever, and difficult breathing.

CIRCULATION 0? 180 valve ; and this doctrine he continued, with many quirks and tricks, to maintain to his dying day. Mr. "Winslow agreed with Mery; he said, that the foramen ovale had no valve ; that though it had a membrane, that membrane performed nothing of the office of a valve; that the blood passed freely from right to left, or from left to right, as occasion required; that thus the two auricles were as one. He forgot for a time that there is but little circulation in the foetal lungs; that the right auricle is filled with all the blood of the body, while the left is filled very sparingly by the pulmonic veins. From these data it is pâ€™ain, that the balance must always' be in favour of the right auricle; that it always must be more full of blood; that with- out some valve the blood must rush with a continual pressure from right to left; while, again, the place of the valve is itself a demonstration that the blood can- not pass from left to right. Winslow, when he some years after perceived that he had spoken idly upon this subject, left Mr. Mery among his foolish argu- ments and dissections, and retracted all that he had written with a manliness of spirit which deserves to be recorded. The foramen ovale, is not strictly oval, but is rather round. In the plan it appears oval, because there I have endeavoured to represent the condition of the vessels vhen the heart is dilated and the vessels full; but-when we lay it. out for demonstration or for drawing, it appears, as in the drawing, of a rounded shape. The oval hole is in the partition betwixt the two auricles at its very backmost point; for, in fact, the auricles

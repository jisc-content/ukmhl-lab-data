109 OF THE BLOOD. out from a vat in basons, and poured from dish to dish. Combustion, then, is a process which consists in the rapid assumption of the basis of pure air, and a conse- quent conversion of the burning body into an air en- dowed with peculiar qualities and powers. If, then, the oxygenation of the blood be a process like this, it must differ chiefly in degree; it might In certain circumstances become too rapid, and resemble an actual combustion; and so in certain circumstances it does, for our atmosphere is so tempered that no more than 27 parts out of 100 consists of pure air; the rest is food for vegetables, but not fit to maintain flame or animal life. This is the reason that even burning as well as breathing are slow processes, and that an animal, if made to breathe pure air, or vital air as it is called, gets the basis of air too rapidly united to its system, is consumed and inflamed quickly, and dies. Secondly, the process of calcination is the same in all metals; it also is an assumption of the pure air, or rather of its basis, with a change of qualities and increase of weight: if you calcine lead slowly, it be- comes first yellow, then orange, then red; it becomes heavier, so that from 100 pounds of lead you have 110 pounds of lytharge, or calx of lead: if you calcine mercury, it also becomes first yellow, then red, and much heavier than at first: if you distil any of these metals, you can by heat merely drive out the purest air from them; they recover their brilliancy and grow lighter, because the basis of air is expelled. The basis of pure air is expelled, not in that solid form in which it was embodied by the calx, but be- Ing

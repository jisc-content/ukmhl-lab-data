DISEASES OF 226 gagni’s. In the first place, the distorted posture of his shoemaker can have no effect; for we must not forget how limber, flexible, and free from disease, the aorta is in those who have the unhappiness to be deformed, and in w horn the aorta follows the spine so closely, that often the bones almost meet in their dis- tortions, and hide it. I have cut out these aorta some- times and laid them on boards, to show the strange angles which they make with such perfect safety. Next I have to observe, that where the auricles and ventricles dilate in old people, the aorta also dilates: for there the aorta is old, partly ossified; its muscular coat stiff and incapable of action; it is, in short, as weak as the heart itself, and yields along with it to the accumulating blood. But in younger men, the aorta being muscular and strongly contractile, this phenomenon ensues: that as the heart increases in size and weakness every day, it struggles with less effect against the accumulation; its pulses are imperfect; it delivers less blood into the aorta; the aorta, less per- fectly filled, is not excited by the same power which formerly filled it and kept it full: therefore it con- tracts gradually and slowly ; it preserves stiil its healthy constitution; it is limber, pliant, and sound, in its muscular coat. In short, this doctrine of Morgagni’s implies only a stationary condition of the aorta; this other theory implies an active contraction. Now Morgagni’s shoemaker was a portly man, but his aorta was smaller than a woman’s. Even this case of his own implies an actual contraction ; since, had this man’s aorta continued stationary, it must have been still the aorta of a man of good statyre, joined to

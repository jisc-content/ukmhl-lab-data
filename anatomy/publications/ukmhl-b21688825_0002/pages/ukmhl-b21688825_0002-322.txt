OF THE CAROTID ARTERIES. 258 Vain as Dr. Monro’s expectation of compressing the? abdominal aorta by pushing with his fist against thebelly. The carotid artery, having emerged from the chest, runs up along the neck by the side of the trachea, a single undivided artery, without twig or branch, till it touches the jaw.

But the cylindrical form of this artery should not occupy our attention so much, as that peculiarity of direction which, though apparently exposed, keeps it safe; or those important connections which make it so danger-. ous either to cut or to tie this artery. First, The carotid artery, from the place where it emerges from the chest up to the angle of the jaw, is continually receding from the fore-part of the throat, is getting deeper and deeper by the side of the trachea, at last the strong projection of the larynx or cartila- ginous part of the tube defends it j and when it has got to the angle of the jaw, it lies there so deep under the ear, betwixt the ear and the jaw, in a sort of axilla, as we may call it, filled with fat and glands, that it is almost out of reach of danger, unless it be sometimes of the surgeon’s knife, but rarely of wounds.

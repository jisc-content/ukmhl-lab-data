OF THE BR Alfa. 305 Veussens first discovered this curious structure ; Ridley denied it, and Haller at last in his turn con* firmed it. Veussens believed that the sinus which deposited this blood conveyed it away again. Haller says that this is the peculiar office of that vein which accompanies the carotid artery, and which is named the vena sodalis arterise carotidis. It was once supposed that certain small arteries opened also into the sinus; but it has neither arteries, nor pulsation. Thus we trace the carotid through its canal, through the cavernous sinus, up to the side of the sella turcica, and about to enter the brain, to give off the arteries of the brain. But before we describe these, it will be easy to count shortly those little twigs which it gives off in the canal and in the sinus. The carotid artery seldom gives out arteries before it enters the skull; it is a lusus naturae, when it does happen that the occipital or pharyngeal arteries come off from it. The first twig, which in any case it gives off, is sometimes a small artery, which returns downwards along with the upper maxillary nerve * ; next a small twig, accompanied by a branch from the meningeal ar- tery, goes into the tympanum by way of theaquse duc- tus Fallopii; and next, while the artery is within the sinus cavernosus, it gives out two little branches, the one forwards the other backwards, named arteries of the receptaculum* 1. The little artery Which goes backwards from the sinus or receptaculum goes chiefly to that part of the dura * The second branch of the 5th pair. Vol. II. X

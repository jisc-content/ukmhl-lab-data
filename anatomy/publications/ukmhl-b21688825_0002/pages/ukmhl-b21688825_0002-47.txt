OF THE HEART. 7 circulation of the human body may be traced easily in the following way.—-Here the heart of the lungs is set off from the heart of the body, being as distinct in office as in form and parts ; on the right side is the heart of the lungs, on the left side is the heart of the body. —[a) Is the great vein called vena cava from its im- mense size ;—there is an ascending and a descending cava; the one brings the blood from the head and arms, the other brings the blood from all the lower parts of the body ; they meet at (</), and form by their dilatation there’a chief part of that bag which is call- ed the auricle,—in it they deposite all the returning blood of the body, and thus present it at the right side of the heart to be moved through the lungs.—{b) Is the right auricle ; it is in part formed by a dilata- tion of these veins, but it puts on a strong and mus- cular nature as it approaches the heart; it is the first, cavity of the heart, and, like all its parts, is strong and irritable ; it is filled by the returning blood of the Ca- vas ; it receives, dilates, is oppressed by this great quan- tity of blood; it is strongly excited to. act; in its action thebloodgoes down into the ventricle or lower cavity of the heart.—(c) Is the right ventricle, thick and strong in its walls, and of great muscular power ; it is filled by the auricle, and is strongly stimulated both by the stroke of the auricle and by the weight and quan- tity, and also, in some degree, by the qualities, of the blood; its action is sudden and violent, and it drives the blood through all the system of the lungs.—[d) Is the pulmonic artery,—the artery of the lungs which receives all the blood of the right side of the heart; it is filled by the stroke of the right ventricle, from B 4> whose

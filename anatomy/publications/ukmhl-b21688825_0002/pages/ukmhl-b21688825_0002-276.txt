MALCONFORMATION OF 212 of breathing which I have called forced respiration, and no other plainly can serve. ' The ordinary respiration, by which we draw in 40 cubic ounces of air, has failed; the fit is approaching, because that quantity of air will not suffice. However rapidly the child breathes, however rapidly the heart palpitates, it will not do, because there are but 40 ounces of pure air mixed with the whole of that great mass which remains always in the lungs. Then the child, driven by instinct, provides for the fullest respi- ration : it turns upon its face, that the weight may help to compress the thorax; it forces with all its power, and seems to cease from breathing, and refrains a long while in that state, because it is emptying and compressing the lungs. Thenits purposeis accomplished; the lungsare more emptied than in ordinary respiration; it draws in the largest draught of air, utters a sort of scream, seems quiet again; and again, by pressing its breast, and by contortions (convulsive like of its bo- dy) , it empties its lungs at a distant interval, and re- ceives again the fullest draught of air. It is this forced respiration that brings into the lungs 70 cubic inches of air more than the usual respiration does. This, then, is three times more effectual than ordinary breathing; and wffien a boy grown up to those years in which he knows the warnings of his disorder, and has found oat this relief; when such a boy by pressing upon the corner of a table, or by throwing himself upon the ground, prevents or alleviates his paroxysms, in what way can it be but by practising for a time this deeper respiration? pressing the chest, forcing and compressing the lungs beyond their usual degree of collapse.

3 3 OP THE HEART. the auricle of the heart. It looks as if formed merely by the vein entering at an acute angle, and by the inner edge of the vein, or that which is joined to the auricle, rising high, so as to do the office of a valve. The very first appearance of the valve, and its place just over the mouth of the cava, seems to point out that use which Lancisi has assigned it, viz. to support the blood of the upper cava, and prevent that column of blood which descends from the cava gravitating upon the opposite column which comes from the liver and lower parts of the body; and yet this, most likely, is not its use. The valve somewhat resembles a crescent, or the membrane called hymen. It occupies just that half of the cava which is nearest the auricle. Its deepest part hangs over the mouth of the cava, and is nearly half an inch in breadth, seldom more, often less, some- times a mere line. Its two horns extend up along the sides of the auricle ; the posterior horn arises from the left of the isthmus, as it is called, or edge of the oval hole; its anterior horn arises from the vena cava, where it joins the auricle. Behind the valve the remains of the foramen oval may be seen, now shut by its thin mem- brane, but still very easily distinguished; for its arch- like edges are so thick, strong, and muscular, that they look like two pillars, and thence are called the co- lumns foraminis ovalis *. these two pillars were called isthmus viessf.nii, and by Haller are named annulus fossae ova Life, while the hole itself is so deep that it is named the fossa ovalis. Before the Eusta- chian valve lies the great opening into the ventricle ; but betwixt that and the valve there is a fossa or hollow, in which lies the opening of the great coronary vein; and the valve which covers the coronary vein is a . neat

OF THE THORAX, 405 taking the pulmonic vein as a conductor, creeps back- wards along it into the substance of the lungs. These bronchial arteries are the least regular in all the body, coming off usually from the aorta, but some- times from the mammary, and often from the upper intercostal artery; sometimes also they arise from the intercostals of the aorta. But from one or other of these sources we usually have three or four bronchial arteries, which are so named from their belonging to the branches of the trachea or bronchiae. Ruysch, who first discovered this artery, and Syl- vius de la Boe and others who followed Ruysch, and used his words in describing the artery, explained its office truly: they said it was for nourishing the sub- stance of the lungs. But this sensible opinion was dis- puted by many physicians of very great reputation ; who maintained that it was quite disproportioned to the size of the lungs, and that it nourished the trachea only ; and they gave a most whimsical reason for be- lieving all this. The lungs they considered as made of very coarse stuff, which the half elaborated blood of the right ventricle and pulmonic artery might serve ; while the harder and more perfect substance of the trachea required a more perfect and finer blood. 5. ARTEREE CESOPHAGExE. The iE soph age al arteries are generally five or six in number. They are small twigs which come off from the aorta below the bronchial arteries; they encircle the oesophagus, and make anastomoses with D d 3 each

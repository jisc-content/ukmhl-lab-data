12$ OF THE BLOOD. any animal, the water which surrounds the air, in either case, will be raised to the same temperature, or, if surrounded with ice, the same quantities of ice will be dissolved. But to tell us . his, is to tell us nothing; for without knowing the* rapidity of the process, we know nothing of the intensity of the heat. Suppose, for example, that one of these philosophers had told us that iron-filings put into water to rust acquire the same quantity of oxygene that iron burnt in the fire does, and, though slowly, gives out the same quantity of heat, because it can acquire no oxygene but what parts with its heat. All this is true; but yet burning and rusting are very different, and so combustion and respiration are. While the vapour which issues from the lungs keeps to the temperature of 96°, and while the lungs and heart do not exceed in heat the rest of the body, there can be little chance of any heat being generated in the lungs, except what is balanced and carried off by the hydrogene and carbonic airs, or by the halitus from the natural secretions of the lungs. That the animal heat is produced by the action of vessels; that heat does not proceed from the lungs, but is produced in each part of the body—is beauti- fully proved by what happens in aneurism, where the artery is tied up (in the thigh for example); and where we make, as it were, a great experiment upon animal heat, in the human body itself. 1st. Immediately after the operation, the pulse is stopped, the limb is benumbed, it grows cold, and sinks one or two degrees below the standard of its natural heat. This is the moment of total interruption in the great trunk, and of particular danger. 2diy. In

OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 453 The projection by which the artery is thus thrown forwards is not merely the naked pelvis and the head of the femur; these parts are covered by the flesh and tendons of the psoas tnagnus and iliacus internus, which also come out from the pelvis to the thigh. The artery lies cushioned upon these muscles; the muscles dive very deep to get at the trochanter minor or posterior trochanter of the thigh-bone. The artery follows them; and thus it is plunged as it were into a deep cavity, assumes a new’ position, and this con- stitutes a second point of description. The hollow in which the artery now lies may be compared with that of the bend of the arm. The ar- tery now takes the name of femoral, lies deep in a hollow,surrounded by much fat and many glands; the cavity is covered with a very strong fascia, or tendi- nous sheath, which descends from the muscles of the belly over Poupart’s ligament, and which is greatly strengthened at this point by the general fascia of the thigh. Here the femoral artery, instead of sending off less effectual branches from point to point as it moves downwards, and which could not have conveniently penetrated through all the thickness of the thigh, sends off one great branch, which furnishes all the thigh without exception, whence it is named the muscular ar- tery of the thigh. This great artery goes off from the femoral just like the ulnar from the artery at the bend of the arm, i. c. very deep among the muscles, in the triangular cavity above described. Thence it is oftener named profunda than muscular artery. The femoral artery having sent down this great branch-, equal almost to itself in size, inclines out- Cg3 wards

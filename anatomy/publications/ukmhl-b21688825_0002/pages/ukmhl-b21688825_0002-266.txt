202 MALC0NF0RMATI0N OF know by the pale and subsiding countenance how aw- ful the inward feelings are, and woe be to him who has not feeling enough to sympathise with this distress* and an anxious desire to understand the cause, and to alleviate the misery, of inward diseases which he can- not cure! These are seducing motives, and might of them- selves have drawn me on to give this slight sketch of the malconformations and diseases of the heart: but I feel also the stronger motives of duty and necessity ; for truly, without some knowledge of the ill organized* irregular, and diseased heart, the structure and func- tions of the heart in its sounder state would be bull poorly understood. This sketch, then, is the last pari; of this anatomy of the heart. While the following history serves to correct our notions of the mechanism of the heart, we must also observe how it explains and illustrates up to a much higher point the combined functions of the heart and lungs, viz. the oxydation of the blood. Perhaps no- thing can better explain the effects of a full and heal- thy oxydation, than a sparing oxydation of the blood, such as produces disease. The foetus alone can live with its single heart; it lives in the womb by its having a heart different from that of an adult. A foetus, then, being horn, cannot live with that heart which served it in the womb; and Nature, as I have exained already, divides the single heart, and there is then a heart for the lungs and a heart for the body. But if any fault in the or- ganization prevent this separation of the heart; if the foramen ovale be preserved open ; or if there should be any

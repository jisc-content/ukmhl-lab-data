* 18 OF THE MECHANISM ger, laxer, flatter, and thinner in the walls, is, as it were, wrapped round the left; and thus the left ventricle alone forms the acute apex of the heart, and the left ventricle of necessity bulges very much into the cavity of the right, since the right ventricle is so much larger, and in a manner wrapped round it. In both ventricles, it is very remarkable, that towards the opening of the auricle the surface of the ventricle is very rugged, irregular, and crossed wTith columnar carnese, while a smooth and even lubricated channel marked (m)-—leads towards the artery. 7. The pulmonic artery arises from the right ven- tricle, to carry out the blood close by the great open" ing at which the auricle pours it in ; the artery rises at its root in a very bulging triangular shape. It is the valve within the mouth of the artery that gives it this very peculiar shape without; for the bulging root is divided into three knobs, indicating the places of the three valves, the artery dilating behind each valve into a little bag, which when it is described, is called its sinus. 8. This valve of the pulmonic artery (h)—has a more perfect and simple form than that of the auricle. The valves in the mouth of each of the great arteries are three in number 5 they are thin but strong mem- branes, rising from the circle of the artery, where it comes off from the /heart; each valve is se- milunar; its larger and looser edge hangs free into the cavity of the artery; the edge is a little thicker than the rest of the valve; the three valves together form one perfect circle, which closes the mouth of the artery so that no grosser fluid, nor hardly air can pass.

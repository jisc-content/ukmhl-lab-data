OF THE CAROTID ARTERIES. %55 Columbus in the presence of a great many gentlemen and strangers, with no less misery to them than amuse- ment to us (the pupils), who, though we knew the cause, ascribed it altogether to the black art.” But if any one word of this were true, Valverdus would have told us, and been proud to tell us, by what parti- cular operation, ligature, or pressure, this strange thing * was performed ; and Columbus himself, the author of this new amusement, would surely have dropped some hints about it in some place or other of his works. But from the modest silence of the master, and the secresy of the pupil, we have reason to believe it is untrue; and if Columbus did ever venture to exhibit such a mean piece of legerdemain, he put himself quite upon the level with the quack and his She- goat. The quack, indeed, was much beyond him in point of merit, since it must have been far easier to teach a clever young Man to fall down or start up than to teach all this to a She-goat. Galen has explained it well, saying, “ that physicians and philosophers, tying the carotid arteries, tie in along with them the recurrent nerves which serve for the voice; and if they will have silence to be sleep, no doubt the creature is mute after their awkward operation ; but no other function is hurt neither then, nor afterwards.” This is the trtyth, and the whole truth nearly ; for if but one Dog lives after both carotids are tied, nothing can be more certain than that those which die must have suffered by some awkwardness or disease. Is it wonderful that, after such a cruel tedious opera- tion as this is, the Dog should be exhausted, should be weakened

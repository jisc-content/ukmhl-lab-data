OF RESPIRATION. 247 of that skinny and bag-like part of its mouth which covers the lower jaw. We are apt now to fall into a worse mistake, for this bag under the jaw is alternate- ly dilated and contracted, the mouth is never opened to take in new air; the creature seems to live all the while upon one mouthful of air, and seems to be playing it backwards and forwards betwixt its mouth and its lungs. But, lastly, when we observe its nostrils, we find that there is in the nostrils a twirling motion for each â– movement of the jaws, which makes the whole pro- cess perfectly simple to our comprehension ; for a f rog breathes by the nostril alone, it cannot breathe by the mouth ; it never raises its mouth above water, nor opens it but to catch flies or other food. If you keep its mouth open, you see it presently struggling for breath ; for its respiration goes on in the following way: Its broad jaws are continually shut; they lock into each other by grooves ; the mouth is completely close,, and forms a sort of bellows, of which the nostrils are the air-holes, and the muscles of the jaws which come from the os hyoides draw in the draught by their alternate contraction and relaxation ; and the nostrils lie so obliquely over the hole in the skull, which is re- presented at (a) in the Plate at the end of this chap- ter, that the least motion of them enables them to perform the office of a valve. First there is a twirl of the nostril which lets in the air; then a dilatation of the bag under the jaws, by which the mouth is greatly enlarged and filled with air ; then a second motion of that bag, by which the mouth is emptied and the lungs filled} then there is a slight motion of L 2 the

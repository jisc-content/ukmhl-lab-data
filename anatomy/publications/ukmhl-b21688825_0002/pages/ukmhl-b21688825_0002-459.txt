3S1 OF THE FOREARM. the supinator and extensors; but being deep, it gives also twigs to the pronator and to the flexor radialis, inosculating with the interosseous arteries. Next the radial artery, emerging from among the thickest of the muscles of the forearm, becomes superficial, touches the naked radius, and runs along it, with the belly of the flexor pollices below it and the long ten- don of the supinator above it. Here are no mus- cles lying on the outside of it, nothing but the ten- don ; and therefore all its twigs are downwards to the flexor pollicis, upon which it lies; the flexor digi* tomm, which lies next to that; and to the flexor ra- dialis and the palmaris longus. Next it gives deeper branches, viz. to the pronator quadratus ; and also it gives small twigs, which accompany the several ten- dons along the naked bone. Arrived at the wrist, it does not divide, as authors have represented, into two branches, viz. a palmar and a dorsal artery, but quite the reverse; the radial artery passes on undivided to the root of the thumb, and there divides into three great branches; one to the thumb, one to the fore- finger, and one to the palm of the hand: it does in- deed, while it is passing the wrist, give two consider- able branches, one to the palm, and one to the back of the hand; yet they are but branches. ARTERIA SUPERFICIALIS VQLAS. The first branch, then, of the radial artery, after arriving at the wrist, is that which goes across the palm of the hand, and may be named the superficial arte- ry of the Faem. It goes off just where the main ar- C c 4 tery

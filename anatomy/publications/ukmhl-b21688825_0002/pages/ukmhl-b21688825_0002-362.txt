296 OF THE ARTERIES of the species, are the most liberally supplied with blood. The womb has on each side two arteries; it has two spermatics, and two bypogastrics, and the inosculations of these vessels are very large and free. The brain has two great arteries on each side; it has two carotids, and two vertebral arteries ; they are in- finitely larger than those of the womb; their inoscu- lations are so particular, that there are no others like them in all the body : the injection of any one artery easily fills the whole; the preservation of but one artery saves the life of tire creature, when the others are stopped. These four arteries alone convey to the head the fifth part of the whole mass of blood. This is the calculation of the older authors ; and even those who would settle it at the lowest point still acknowledge, that the carotid and vertebral arteries receive at least the tenth part of all the blood of the body. The brain then, which weighs not a fortieth part of the whole body, receives one tenth of all the blood; a proportion which must occasion surprise. Besides the profusion of blood which thus rushes into the brain, the impetus with which it forces its- way seems dangerous ; and Nature also seems to have provided against the danger. We cannot be but sen- sible of this danger; for the slightest increase of velo- city occasions strange feelings, if not absolute pain. We cannot run for any length of way, nor ascend a stair rapidly, nor suffer a paroxysm of fever, nor in short have the circulation quickened by violent exertions, by emotions of the mind, or by disease, without feel- ing an alarming beating within the head; we feel it particularly

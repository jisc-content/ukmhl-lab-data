OF THE ARTERIES 302 stuck in the mouth of the middle artery of the brain* Being carefully examined, it was found to be sticking firm in the month of the artery which had burst, as if by the separation of two of its rings. The blood, which thus filled the right ventricle, had also made its way down in prodigious quantity into the third and fourth ventricles, quite into the occipital hole j but the opposite ventricle of the same side it had not filled. The quantity of blood ascending to the head is ex- ceedingly great; its free circulation in all the arteries is perfectly secured ; and the plan of its distribution is extremely simple, for the carotid entering by the os petrosum gives three branches. First, A branch which unites the two carotids with the two vertebrals, and forms the fore part of the circle of Willis. Secondly,. It gives an artery to the great middle lobe, whence it is named the great middle artery of the brain. Thirdly, An artery which is named anterior cerebri, as belong- ing to the fore part of the brain. But the verte- bral, as it arises through the occipital hole, lies upon the cerebellum, and supplies all the cerebellum, and also the back part of the brain. One branch goes to the back part of the cerebellum, another to the fore part of the cerebellum, a third branch goes to the back part of the brain; and thus there is formed betwixt the carotid and the vertebral, by means of the great inosculation of the circle of Willis, one great set of vessels ; which should first of all be described free from all the interruptions of trivial arteries, which go off from point to point, but of which the destina- tions

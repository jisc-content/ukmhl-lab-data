OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. 375 from the humeral artery. One of these, perforating the biceps muscle, turns quite round the bone; and Monro the Father, who gave us the name of spiral nerve, named this also, very properly, the muscular spiral artery : so this artery also, as well as the supra- scapular and circumflex arteries, has its accompanying nerve. This long artery runs down the back and out- side of the arm ; it descends quite to the outer condyle of the os humeri, and by branches round the olecranon, and over the outer condyle, it inosculates very freely with the radial artery. The other branch of the profunda superior runs down the inner side of the arm, gives many branches to the triceps, and coraco-brachialis ; gives a few also to the biceps and deltoid muscle : its longest branch, the proper termination of the artery, runs downwards till it touches the inner condyle, as the posterior branch does the outer condyle; and this inner artery communicates with the outer branch round the ole- cranon, making small ,but frequent and beautiful in- osculations; and it also inosculates over the condyle with the reflected branch of the ulnar artery. In short, the profunda superior turns down towards the back part of the arm, buries itself under the triceps muscle, supplies all the flesh of the triceps, and di. vides in the heart of that muscle into two branches* both of which go down to the elbow-joint, and inos- culate ; the one, round the outer condyle with the ra- dial artery; the other, round the inner condyle with the ulnar artery.

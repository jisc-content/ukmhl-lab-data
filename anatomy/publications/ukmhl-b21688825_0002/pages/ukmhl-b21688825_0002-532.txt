460 OF THE ARTERIES operations ; the popliteal aneurism is a disease of this artery in the ham ; and even the simple operation of amputating either the limb itself, or tumours in the thigh or ham, requires a perfect knowledge of all these arteries. But although no formal operation affected these lesser arteries, yet the main artery itself is so ex- posed, and so superficial where it runs down the thigh, that it is wounded in a hundred various ways. It is very singular {row often it has been wounded by one particular accident, viz. the dropping of a pair of scissars, and with a sudden instinctive effort clapping the knees together to catch them. It has been wounded once or twice by a shoemaker clapping his knees thus together to catch his sharp-pointed paring- knife. One of my pupils lay three months in Lon- don, uncertain whether his femora] artery was wound- ed ; for he had in this way catched his pen-knife, the point of which had run into his thigh, and wound- ed some great artery. It has been cut across by balls; it has been wounded even by a single slug; it has been uncovered by wounds which yet did not touch |ts coats, and has in consequence dilated into an aneu- rism. I have known a boy stab another with a pen- knife in the thigh, and strike so critically as to open the artery with a wound like that of a lancet. My friend Mr. Harkness gave me the privilege of dissecting an aneurismai limb which he was obliged to cut off; and in which the artery was (if I may use such an expression) broken or torn across the upper end of the thigh-bone, which had been broken by a fall about three weeks before.

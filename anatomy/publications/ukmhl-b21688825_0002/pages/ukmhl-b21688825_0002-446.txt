378 OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. times felt for it, and found it after the operation, while the arm was still very small, having been wasted by the disease and by the suppuration. I have not, in describing these arteries of the arm, once mentioned the name of collateral artery; for it is a name which must be entirely dropped, because it has been much abused. Sabbatier, Murray, Haller, and all the French and German anatomists, have na- med the arteriae profundae collateral arteries; because they lie alongside of the great artery, run- ning along with it down the arm. Douglas, and the English anatomists and surgeons, have called the three or four short anastomosing branches near the elbow the collateral arteries; because, though they run off at right angles or obliquely from the trunk, yet they run parallel with each other. Dropping this name, then, we find no more than three arteries in the arm of any note: the upper or greater profunda, with its two branches; the lower or lesser profunda ; and the great anastomosing artery.

The place and condition of this artery at the bend of the arm is as interesting as where it lies in the axilla; for while bleeding is allowed, or is practised by low and ignorant people, operations at this point must be more frequent than at any other, and must be easy or successful only in proportion as the artery and all its relations is well understood.

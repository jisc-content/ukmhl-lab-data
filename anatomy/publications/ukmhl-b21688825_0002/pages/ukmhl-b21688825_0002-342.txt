of the External carotid. 278 emerges before the ear, mounts upon the temple, and is named of course the temporal artery; it per- forms here in the temple the same office which the occipital does behind, viz. it supplies the pericranium, muscles, and skin.: all this is very simple. But the other branch, in which (since it is exceedingly large) one would say the carotid terminates, goes off from the temporal with a sudden bend, sinks very deep under the articulation of the lower jaw, terminates in a lash of branches at the back of the antrum High- morianum, and there gives branches to the lower jaw, the upper jaw, the inside of the cheeks, to the temple (deep arteries which lie under the temporal muscle), to the upper part of the pharynx, to the nostrils, and to various other parts ; it is this artery too which gives off the chief artery of the dura mater. The description of so great an artery, so widely distributed, becomes both difficult and important. 7. ARTERIA MAXILLARIS INTERNA. The INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY tUl'nS off from the temporal artery while imbedded in the substance of the parotid gland, and about the middle of the upright branch or process off the lower jaw-bone. It passes betwixt the lower jaw-bone and the outer ptery- goid muscle; it then goes forwards till it touches the back part of the antrum maxillare, and terminates in a lash of vessels betwixt the back of the antrum and 1 the pterygoid process; and, finally, it ends at the spheno-maxillary fissure, or, in other terms, at the bottom of the socket of the eye, where it gives the infra-

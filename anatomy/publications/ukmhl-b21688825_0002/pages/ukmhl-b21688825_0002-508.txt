438 OF THE ARTERIES 1. ILEO-LUMBALIS. This artery is so named, because it so resembles the lumbar arteries that it might be mistaken for the last of them ; and because it belongs equally to the haunch- bone and to the loins. It goes off from the outer side of the iliac artery, about an inch below the bifur- cation *, it is about the size of the lumbar arteries, or a little larger; it turns in behind the iliac artery, and passes under the psoas muscle j its trunk is short, for it splits immediately into its iliac and lumbar branches. The lumbar branch goes off betwixt the last vertebra of the loins and the inner end of the ilium, and goes directly upwards ; it gives its branches about the psoas muscle. The iliac branch setting off from the same point, runs straight outwards, lodges itself under the edge or crista ilii, aad supplies the iliacus internus muscle by a superficial branch; and it nourishes the bone by a deeper branch, which lies close in the hollow of the haunch. 2. arteria; sacra: laterales. The lateral arteries of the sacrum are very generally three or four in number. Sometimes we find one general artery coming off from the iliac, or from the ileo-lumbar artery, running down all the side of the sacrum, and giving off the lateral sacral arteries; but much more frequently we find three dis- tinct arteries coming off from the sides of the iliac artery, which run across the sacrum in the following manner, to inosculate with the middle sacral artery : First, Each lateral sacral artery has one large branch, which

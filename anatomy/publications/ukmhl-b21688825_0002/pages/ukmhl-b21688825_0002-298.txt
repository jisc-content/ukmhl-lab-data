A 224 DISEASES OP excited to a higher action is itself dilated, and at last forces also the aorta. In truth, neither of these is the true theory; but the aorta in aged persons beginning to ossify, has its middle or muscular coat annihilated, and its outer and inner coats thickened, by the same process. Its muscular power is lest; it is no longer capable of withstanding, much less of seconding, the stroke of the heart by a second stroke; it ceases to act, Suffers itself to be dilated, and in a few years grows into a dreadful disease. I never saw an old aorta without some specks of ossification, or rather of cal- careous concretion, nor an aorta so affected which \yas not dilated in proportion pretty nearly to the degree of this thickening and ossification; at which we need not wonder, since we find not a bene (as it is usually called ossified aorta), but a vile calcareous concretion substituted to its muscular coat. Nature is not at this time, as Hunter supposed, building up and strengthen- ing the walls of the aorta against this disease; but taking down slowly that fabric which has lasted its appointed time. However produced, it is an awful disease; for every organ, when once deranged, especially if it be one as active as this is, never stops in its course; and this especially ends early or late in some terrible kind of death. Sometimes, increasing in size, it destroys all the surrounding parts and bursts within. Some- times it bursts into the chest, and then the patient drops suddenly drown; sometimes into the trachea, and then the cause of the sudden death is known: for the patient, after violent coughings and ejections Â©f blood by the mouth, expires. Sometimes it beats its

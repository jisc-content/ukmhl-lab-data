426 OF THE ARTERIES. moves along the right side of the colon, inclining also a little upwards towards the liver; it also splits when it approaches the gut into two branches; one turning towards the upper side to inosculate with the puddle colic artery, the other turning downwards towards the ilium or flank to inosculate with the ileo-colie artery, ARTERIA ILEO-COLICA. / / 3. The ileocolic artery arises about an inch lower than the last. It is a long, small, and slender artery compared with the two last; which are short, stumpy, and with contorted angles. This artery goes to the place where the small intestines end, and the great ones begin ; of course the membrane which holds the intestines at this corner (I mean in the right haunch) changes its name from mezzo-colon (in the middle of the colon) to mesentery, or mezzo- enteron, (in the middle of the intestines); and of course the ileo-colic artery runs down, not along the mesocolon, but along the mesentery. It goes directly down towards the joining of the ilium with the colon; it ends in three regular branches; one passes straight onwards to the junction of the ilium and colon, splits into two branches, one going over the fore and the other over the back part of the caput coli> and having a very curious correspondence with the valve within, so that it might be called arteria val- vular coli. While this branch goes straight for- wards over both sides of the caput coli, another branch runs backwards along the colon, and inoscu- lates with the right colic artery, and another runs down

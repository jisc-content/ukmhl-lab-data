1248 general plan of RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN. â€¢ The right subclavian goes off from the aorta in a more direct course than the left; it is thought to receive the blood more fully ; perhaps, also, it is rather larger than the left subclavian: but, at all events, there is something peculiar in the mechanism of the right arm; most probably it is the peculiar form or direction of this artery that gives to the right arm a superior dexterity and strength. When Horses are to be broken, we find the chief difiicultyto consist in teach- ing them to move equally with both feet, for they prefer the right; when a Dog trots, or when he digs the ground, he goes with his right side foremost, and digs chiefly with his right foot; and in these creatures we find the same arrangement of these arteries as in our- selves. When we lose our arm, the left hand acquires by use all the strength and dexterity of the right. Since, then, either arm can acquire this dexterity, and since the right leg is stronger by its dependence upon the motions of the right hand, we have every reason to believe, that the preference given to the right hand has some physical cause, and that it is the peculiar form of this artery, viz. going off more directly on the right side, and that those who are ambidexter must have the right as well as the left subclavian going off as one independent branch. There is another peculiarity which has occurred. The arch sometimes gives out four branches, and theleft subclavian, arising first from the arch,has passed behind the trachea, betwixt the trachea and the oesophagus. The

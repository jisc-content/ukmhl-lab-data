126 OF THE BLOOD. is a continual assumption of new parts. The extreme vessels are continually employed in forming some acids, which appear naked in the secretions; in form- ing oxyds, as the fat and the jellies of the membra- nous and white parts; in the various depositions of muscle, bone, tendon, &c.for these are all continually absorbed, thrown off by the urine and incessantly renewed. They are continually employed in filling all the interstices of the body with a bland fluid or halitus ; they are continually employed in forming secretions of various kinds. In performing all this the power of the vessels may do much ; but the ultimate effect in each process must be a chemical change, and perpetual changes will produce a constant heat. Place the organ and focus of this animal heat in the centre of the body, and you are embarrassed in a thousand difficulties; allow this heat to arise in each part accord- ing to its degree of action, and each part provides for itself. But how then, some will say, shall this heat be regulated ? I say plainly by the heart and lungs. The lungs regulate the stimulant power of the blood, the heart regulates the action of the arteries, in so far as regards the stimulus of fulness and distention; and with these to regulate the centre, nothing can alter the heat of the extremities except partial actions, that is disease. I will conclude then, that oxygene, if it do com- municate heat, does so, “ net to the Jungs nor to the blood, but to the whole body through the medium of the blood.”

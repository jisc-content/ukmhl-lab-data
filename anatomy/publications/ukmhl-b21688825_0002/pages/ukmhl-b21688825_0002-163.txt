O? THE BLOOD. Ill phur in open air, it seems to be consumed; but when we burn it in close vessels, still giving a free access to air, we find it converted into an acid the most pon- derous of all, weighing greatly more than the sulphur from which it was procured. The operation is done in close vessels nothing can pass but what is knov/n, and nothing is more certain than that the whole of this wonderful and rapid change is the mere effect of the sulphur, which is an acidifiable base, assuming the acidifying principle by which alone it can become an acid. Phosphorus being burnt in a close glass upon the point of a wire, the vital part of the atmo_ sphere is consumed, the azotic air (which the ancients mistook for their phlogiston) remains, the whole phos- phorus is changed into phosphoric acid, and the whole acid when weighed expressly equals the phosphorus which was burnt, and the air which was consumed along with it. Nay, arsenic, which is a metal, being calcined, is converted into a perfect acid. Thus we see, first, that calcination is a mere combustion, since it can be made so rapid as to be attended with heat and flame; next we see that acidification is, like cal- cination, attended with heat and flame, and an acqui- sidon of weight and of properties like those of calces. We see some metals converted into proper acids ; acids and metals mixing in qualities with each other; acids and metals are both acidifiable bases, both are capable of receiving new and similar properties, by assuming into their composition the basis of pure air; and in one single process the whole set of phenomena are ex- emplified. for in burning arsenic we have combustion, calcination.

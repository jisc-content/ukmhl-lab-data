OF THE ARTERIES OF THE 416 lian lobe. The pancreas covers the root of the hepa- tic artery; it then turns a little forwards, and rising somewhat upwards at the same time, it passes under the pylorus, i. e. under the stomach and duodenum ; it passes behind the omentum minus and biliary ducts j it arrives at the porta where the great vena portae enters the liver, and where the biliary ducts come out; it passes betwixt the biliary ducts and the vein; and having divided a little before into two great branches, these now enter into the right and left lobes of the liver. In this place it is inclosed along with all the other vessels in that sheath of cellular substance which is called the capsule of Glisson. Thus the artery finally terminates near the liver in two great branches, right and left; but before it does so, it gives, as it passes the stomach, duodenum, pan- creas, very important branches to these parts. Be- fore it gives these more important branches, it gives small twigs to the vena portae and to the head of the pancreas ; then it gives off the great artery which is the source of these lesser arteries (to the pylorus, pancreas, and duodenum), viz. the arteria duo- deno-gastrica, which, soon after it goes ofr from the hepatic artery, divides into two chief branche's. One turns backwards along the duodenum to the stomach, and from supplying the stomach and epiploon, is named gastro-epiploic artery. The other, turning down- wards along the duodenum, gives at the same time arte- ries to the pancreas, and so is named arteria pancre- atico-duodenalis. Thetrunkwhich divides into these two

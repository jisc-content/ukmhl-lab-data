28 OF THE MECHANISM contraction is not, like that of the heart, such as to bring its sides together ; on the contrary, the aorta is full when the heart strikes, the action of the heart distends it to the greatest degree, the aorta reacts so as to free itself of this distention, but still it remains in some degree full of blood ; else how could this, like every other artery, preserve always its form and ap- parent size ? In this condition of matters, it is obvious that the coronary branches are on the same footing with all the other branches of the aortic system ; that, like all the other arteries, they first feel the stimulus of fulness from the push of the heart, and along with it the stroke of the aorta. Secondly, with regard to the coronary veins a dis- pute has arisen more violent than this ; for it has been doubted whether the coronary veins, large as they are, do actually convey the whole of the blood which the coronary artery gives out. Veussens believed that some of the coronary arteries opened directly into the ca- vities of the heart, without the interposition of veins. Thebesius, after him, believed that there were some shorter veins by which the blood was returned, not by a long circle into the right auricle, but directly into the ventricles of the heart. Veussens, Thebesius, and others who belonged to their party, pretended to prove this fact by injections: But what doctrine is there which such clumsy anatomy and awkward injec- tions may not be made to prove ? They used mercury, tepid water, and air ; and they forced these, the most penetrating of all injections, till they exuded upon the inner surface of the heart; but if they had fixed their tubes, not into the coronary artery, but into the aorta, ahd

131 OF THE BLOOD, We find tfiis decomposition of water offering new connections, and great views of nature, in all the departments of vegetable and animal life ; which, in this place at least, we dare not pursue. How per- fectly simple the structure of the most delicate plants and flowers are, may be easily seen in the regularity of those vessels which run through them in one curve or slightly spiral line from root to flower. This sim- plicity of structure must be presumed from a thousand facts in gardening, very ordinary but very surprising: Parts may be cut from one plant and engrafted oa another; slips shoot and thrive, and grafts may be in- serted with either end downwards ; if with the upper part downwards, still it thrives ; the upper part then sends roots into the earth, while that which should have been the root puts forth leaves. It is still a more curious proof of the simple organization of plants, that all the parts of plants, their roots, stalks, leaves, fruit, are all capable of performing the common functions apart: the branches or leaves of plants, if plunged 'in soil, pump up their sap as usual ; even the leaves, strewed upon the surface of water, absorb the water ; and if it be impregnated, for example, with fixed air, they absorb the air, decompose it, reserve the carbon, and treasure it up in their own substance, and emit nothing but the purest air. Many things I must here pass over in silence; as, how plants perform their functions, and assimilate the principles of colour, taste, and smell, only when stimulated and aided by the presence of heat and light; how, when they absorb the atmosphere along K 2 with

OF THE HEART. 41 dead; and just as in this peculiar part o£ the system irritability is in high proportion, there are in the scale of existence certain animals endowed in a wonderful degree with this principle of life. They are chiefly the amphibious creatures, as they are called, needing little air, which have this power of retaining life; no stimuli seem to exhaust them, there seems especially to be no end to the action of their heart; a Newt’s or a ToadTs heart beats for days after the creature dies ; a Frog, while used in experiments, is often neglected and forgotten, its limbs mangled, and its head gone, perhaps its spinal marrow cut across, and yet for a whole night and a day its heart does not cease beating, and continues obedient to stimuli for a still longer time. It seems as if nothing but the loss of organization could make this irritable muscle cease to act; or rather it seems as if even some degree of deranged organization could be restored: breathe upon a heart which has ceased to act, and even that gentle degree of heat and moisture will restore its action. Dr. Gar* diner having left a Turtle’s heart neglected in a hand* kerchief, he found it quite dry and shrivelled, but by soaking it in tepid water its plumpness and contractility were restored. Since then this irritable power supports itself in parts long after they are severed from the body, what doubt should we have that there is in the mus- cular fibre some innate contractile power or vis insita independant of nerves ? And when we talk on a sub- ject so difficult and so abstruse, what other proof can we expect or wish for than the power of one peculiar- and insulated muscle surviving the separation of the head

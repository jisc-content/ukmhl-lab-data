W THE PELVIS. 443 ARTERIA GLUTjEA. The gluteal artery goes off from the internal iliac immediately after the lateral sacral arteries. It is exceedingly large, thick, and short, w ithin the pel- vis, for it immediately turns over the bone the turn which it makes over the naked bone is backwards and upwards; it instantly divides itself into a great lash pf vessels, which spread in every direction, supply the two glutaeal muscles, and turn and ramify upon the back of the haunch-bone, just as the great scapular arteries play over the surface of the scapula. The pyriform muscle goes out from the pelvis at the same great opening with the glutaeal artery, and the artery is further accompanied by the great sciatic nerve; they pass together over the pyriform muscle betwixt it and the bone; and when the glutaeal artery is to give out its branches, it splits into two great branches at the edge of the glutaeus medius muscle. By this splitting the glutaeal artery is ar- ranged thus: First, One great branch passes under the glutaeus medius, of consequence it is naked upon the back of the ilium; it sends one large and beautiful artery, which courses round the bone ac- cording to the line of the crista ilii, which supplies all the upper half of the haunch-bone with its nutri- tious arteries, and supplies of course all the upper half of the great or outermost glutaeal muscle where it arises from the spine and dorsum of the ilium. Another large branch, still belonging to this deeper artery, passes under the thickest part of the belly of the gluteus medius, lies upon the small fan-like muscle named

OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 5oo The supra-scapular artery very often conies off from the thyroid artery; in which case it is the last in order of all the branches of the thyroid, that is to say, the nearest to the shoulder, and then it is named transversaijs humeri, because of its going across the root of the neck to the shoulder. Some- times it arises from the cervicalis superficialis; but then it is a small artery, and I suspect it reaches in such cases no further than the tip of the shoulder, and does not descend to the scapula. Often I see it arising as a distinct artery, large, very long, tortu- ous like the splenic artery, and almost equalling it in size; running across the root of the neck, till at the top of the shoulder it dives under the acromion process; and then passing through the notch of the scapula, supplies all the flesh of its upper surface. The reason of my naming it supra-scapular artery, is its passing thus over the scapula, while another, the largest branch of all those proceeding from the sub- clavian artery, is named sub scapula ris, from passing under the scapula. To repeat the oiigin then of this supra-scapular artery, it arises sometimes as an independant artery, and is so great, that we wonder that it does not always do so. often it arises from the thyroid, is its last branch, and is named transversalis humeri, authors not observing that it belongs absolutely to the scapula; it rarely arises from the cervicalis super- ficialis; and when it does so, it is small: often in a strong man it arises apart; and when it does arise from the thyroid or cervical arteries, it is so large as

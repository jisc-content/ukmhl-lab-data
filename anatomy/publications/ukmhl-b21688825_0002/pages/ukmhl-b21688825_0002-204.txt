Their muscles of respiration are not the muscles of the belly but the muscles of the jaws; and this causes the uncouth br< adness of the jaws in Frogs, Newts, Lizards, Serpents, Turtles, &c. Now we shall no longer wonder why the Frog never opens its mouth ; why it never seems to breathe; why, after opening its belly, the lungs still project; why, after emptying its lungs, it can fill them again at will, not by any peculiar power in the lungs, but by blowing them up with its jaws. If you gag the Frog and keep its mouth open, it cannot fill them, because it cannot breathe; if you plug its nostrils, it suffocates, though not soon; if you keep its mouth open by force, you soon find it struggling for breath ; and looking into its throat, you see the glottis open- ing from time to time*. The Newt (or as it is called in this country, the Ask) breathes with the jaws and nostril like the * Dr. Monro in his explanation of Plate IS. shows us very obli- gingly the diaphragm of a Frog, marked (cJ.â€”This diaphragm is mentioned a second time in explaining the same Plats?.

OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. S68 But these things must not be passed over in total silence. In the firsrplace, the artery, as it passes over the border of the chest, and after leaving the arch of the clavicle, is felt beating, and there only can it be compressed. The compressing of the subclavian artery with a tourniquet or with the thumb, attracted at one time so much attention, and incited so many to speak about it, that it came to be thought important, and has been ever since esteemed practicable; and yet even those who have spoken the most con- fidently have taken the thing merely upon vague report, have neglected to read the proper books, have described the way of compressing as above the clavicle, not knowing that it should be done below it, Camper, in his ‘4 Fabrica Brachii Hu- mani,” first mentioned what he had demonstrated in his class, viz. that it could, by placing the thumb under the point of the carocoid process, so compress the axillary artery against the second rib where it lies upon it, that even the strength of a syringe could not push an injection through it *.

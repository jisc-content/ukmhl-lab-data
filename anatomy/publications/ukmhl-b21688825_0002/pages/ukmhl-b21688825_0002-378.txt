OP THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY-. 312 bri ; for the vertebral artery gives two arteries to the cerebellum, and one to the back part of the brain. OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. The vertebral artery, though but the secondary ar- tery of the head, is a principal one of the brain, and conveys a very great proportion of blood; and its turnings and windings before it enters the skull are almost as particular as those of the carotid itself. The vertebral is among the first branches of the axil- lary artery, and comes off from it where it lies across the root of the neck. The two lower ganglions of the sympathetic nerves lie over it, and their threads surround its trunk, making curious net-works round it. The artery then enters into the canal prepared for it in the transverse processes of the vertebra, com- monly getting in by the 6th vertebra; but in this it is irregular sometimes entering into the 7th or low- est; and it has been seen entering into the upper- most hole but one. In this canal it ascends in a di- rect line from the bottom of the neck to the top ; but like the carotid it makes great contortions before it enters the skull; for when it has reached the second vertebra, its transverse process being rather longer than those of the lower vertebrae, the artery is forced to incline outwards ; and the transverse process of the atlas or first vertebra being still much longer, the ar- tery in passing through it is carried still farther out- wards }

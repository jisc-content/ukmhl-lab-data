285 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID, jnaxillary slit, it descends along the groove, which is formed betwixt the pterygoid process and the palate bone; and when it has got down to the palate, one lesser branch turns backwards through the posterior palatine hole, and expands upon the velum palati; the other larger branch is the great palatine artery, for it comes through the anterior or larger palatine hole; the artery itself is large, it runs all along the roof of the mouth betwixt the pulpy substance of the palate and the bone; in this progress it gives little arteries to the sockets of the teeth, and it frequently terminates, mot merely in the palate itself, but in a small artery which runs up through the foramen in- cisivum, or hole under the fore teeth, into the cavity of the nose. This artery is also accompanied with a corresponding palatine nerve. 10. The UPPER PHARYNGEAL ARTERY is the highest of all the branches of the internal maxillary; it goes off at the back of the orbit, opposite the spheno-maxil- lary fissure; it ascends along the sphenoid bone to the place of the sphenoidal sinus, and along the upper part or arch of the pharynx, where that bag adheres to the basis of the skull; it also goes along the sides of the pharynx; its twigs are of very diminutive size; some go into the substance of the sphenoid bone to nourish it by small holes both over the cells and in the alse: a branch goes towards the ptery- goidean or vidian hole*, where it inosculates usually with a branch from the internal carotid artery, some- * This is the hole by which the recurrent of the 5th pair goes backwards from the nose into the skull. times

GS OF THE BLOOD. heart; the diameter, aiid the strength of walls, and the direction of the aorta; their experiments consisted in fixing clumsy tubes into the arteries, or in calculating the whole quantity of blood by bleeding an anfmal to death; they applied nothing but the laws of hydrau- lics, i. e. of fluids rising and falling in rigid tubes, to explain the active arteries of a living body: in short, in explaining the living body they forgot that it was alive. But now the age of infallible proofs and de- monstrations has passed over, and the works of Keill, Pitcairn, Borelii, are quite neglected. dhis disordered and miserable state of science, which continued for a century nearly, arose from those red particles of the blood engrossing too much attention, and from their being allowed an importance which does not belong to them; although one must still ac- knowledge that they are very surprising, because they are very unaccountable, at least I do not kilow that any natural or likely use for them has been yet assigned. Leeuwenhoek, looking through his glasses, saw that this which gave the red colour was the most perma- nent characteristic part of the blood: he saw that this part consisted of red particles floating in the serum; he found, or pretended to find, that they were of the same size in a Man as in a foetus; in a Chick as in a Hen; in a Whale or Elephant, he found them the same as in a Mouse or Minnow; merely because it was convenient for him to find it so. But poring still longer over these particles, he per- ceived that the great globules were so far imperfect as often to break in pieces, and roll about in the serum in separate parts; and he always found that there were

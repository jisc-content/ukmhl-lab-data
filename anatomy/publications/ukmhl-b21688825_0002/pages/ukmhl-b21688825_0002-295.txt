231 THE HEART. though wounds of the heart are really mortal, yet ulcers of the heart certainly are not mortal;” by which he means, that while the Eel was alive it was continu- ally biting the heart*. In short, from these things, we perceive that we need not look into books for any satisfaction on this delicate point; that we must depend upon ourselves, and make a better use of ail future occasions; for unhappily there are no good histories attached to those dissections in which the coagula have been likest to those of a long formed diseasef. The heart, which is so often dilated by weakness, is sometimes reduced in size by an increase of strength and action. It becomes dense, firm, thick in sub- stance, but small in its cavity; it appears to be dilated without, but is, in fact, contracted within. This thickening of the walls of the ventricles is what I cannot understand, though I have cut many such hearts with the utmost care. There is no ossification of the valves, no straitening of the aorta, nor any other obstruction to excite the heart. There is no enlarge- ment of the auricles, no dilatation of the veins, no disease of the arteries, nothing appears but a thicken- ing, and enlargement, and condensation of the walls * It is certain enough that small worms are found not only in the Gssophagus, but in the aorta too, of Dogs and other animals.

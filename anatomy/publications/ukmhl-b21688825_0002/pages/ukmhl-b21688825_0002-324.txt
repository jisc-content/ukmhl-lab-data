OF THE CAROTID ARTERIES. 260 nection which is thus early begun. They are, indeed, inclosed in one sheath of cellular membrane , so that what touchesthe one almost inevitably affects the other. The par vagum being the great nerve of the viscera, at least of the stomach, strictures upon it or wounds are certainly fatal. A surgeon might easily, if it were possible for him to be called in time, take up the gaping mouth of the artery safely when it were cut across; yet in most of such cases the nerve being also cut, the operation would be fruitless. But as for a deliberate dissection of the skin, the artery beating furiously, and the parts embarrassed with any tumour, and the operator alarmed with a deluge of blood from the veins: that, I think, would be a bold step. In short, the necessity of any such operation is reduced to the accident of tumours or wounds about the angle of the jaw; in which cases, the sponge thrust down into the wound will almost always check the blood. "When the common carotid has risen to the angle of the jaw, it divides into two great arteries, one going to the outside of the head, the other to the brain ; the one of course named the external, the other the internal carotid. Some of the most eminent anatomists are incorrect when they say, that the carotid artery gives no branches till it arrives at the larynx. They say so because the first branch goes to the larynx; but, in fact, the carotid passes much beyond the place to which it is to give its first branch, for instead of branching at the larynx, it does not do so till it arrives at the corner of the jaw; there, as I have observed, it can, as in an axilla, lie deep and safe; and the laryngeal artery, which is the first branch * of

OP THE ARTERIES ARTERIiE RECUR RENTES. The recurrent arteries are small arteries corre- sponding with the anastomosing arteries from above. They turn quickly backwards almost as soon as they are clear of the main arteries from, which they arise: they encircle the whole joint, for they are no less than four, or sometimes five, in numbers One from the radial, two from the ulnar, and one from the inte? yosseous artery, RECURRENS RADIALIS ANTERIOR. The anterior recurrent of the radial artery is the first branch which it sends off, excepting a small branch to the supinator and skin. The place where the radial recurrent is to be found, is deep in the hollow betwixt the brachialis internus or muscle of the arm, and the extensor radialis or first muscle of the forearm, viz. that which constitutes its outer edge. The recurrent lies upon the forepart of the joint, where the outer condyle is: the muscles which lie over this recurrent artery, or near it, are the two flexors of this wrist, the supinator longus, and the biceps, and these receive its first branches 5 and one of its branches runs down along the tendon of the supi- nator, Its next branches go less regularly to the other muscles of the forearm, as to the pronator teres, and to the flexors of the fingers; it has one superfi- cial anastomosing artery, whose anastomoses are not upon the naked joint ; but, on the contrary, the branch

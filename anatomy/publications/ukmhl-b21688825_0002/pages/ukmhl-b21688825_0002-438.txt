310 OP THE AXILLARY ARTERY. would make every wound less dangerous, but because it would greatly facilitate operations which we are called upon every day to perform. Would it not be pleasant if we could cut the cancerous breast without the loss of blood ? or search into the axilla with perfect delibe- ration, and cut diseased parts out with the knffe, not tearing them in a brutal manner with our fingers ? Yet still, by studying this piece of anatomy, the surgeon knows both from what source all the arteries which bleed upon the surface of the amputated breast come, viz. the long mammary artery; and also that in any very dangerous situation it would be easy to command all the bleeding orificies by one dip of the needle, the axilla being open. He also knows that the thoracica alarisand the short thoracic artery supply all the glands, and that these lurk too deep in the axilla to be secured otherwise than by a compress: so that these arteries are in fact opened by tearing with the fingers, and are- stopped by thrusting in a spunge. He knows also how many large arteries there are, especially about the sca- pula, of which the bleeding must resemble that of the axillary artery itself; he will judge of the nature of the wound by the pulse ; and he will act with great advantage in all doubtful cases, by remembering these great arteries of the scapula, which either bleed out- wardly most furiously, or if they seem to stop, it is only by filling the axilla with blood. Thirdly, The connection of the artery with the axillary nerves, though it must be more fully described in another place, must yet be observed here as a relation too important to be omitted. The artery passes

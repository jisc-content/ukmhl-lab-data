OF THE BLOOD. 11$ air, which is the cause or acidity in all bodies, anct this third great fact in chemistry may well Suggest to Us a higher view of our present subject; for liiis prin- ciple, which bestows weight and causticity on metals, acidity on acid bases, and new properties on all it touches, must make similar, or at least important, chan ges on the blood, converting it into an oxycl or subacid* and we may fairly begin our next general fact under the title of the oxydation or oxygenation of the blood! The oxydation of the blood makes a fact no less important in physiology than those are in chemistry j for as there are various marks of the influence of oxy- gene on the blood itself, there-are terrible proofs of its importance in the system, and how miserable the person is who has imperfect organs or an ill oxygena- ted blood. Nature, disregarding all occasional supplies, as'by the absorption of the skin, the assimilat ion of aliments, &c. has appointed one great organ for the oxygena- tion of the blood, viz. the lungs. In opening the breast of a living creature we best see the connection of respiration with the great system; but it is out of the body that we can best understand its particular effects upon the blood. The most obvious effect of air is its heightening the colour of the blood. If we expose blood to fixed air, or azotic air, it continues dark; these fluids com- municate nothing, they have no effect on the colour of the blood : when we expose blood to atmospheric air, it assumes a florid colour; for in the atmosphere there is a large proportion of oxygene gas: if, lastly! we expose it to oxygene gas, the purest of all air, it Vol. II; I

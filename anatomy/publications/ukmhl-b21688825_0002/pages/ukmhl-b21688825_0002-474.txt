406 OF THE ARTERIES each other; and very generally they pass off from the oesophagus to the posterior mediastinum, or that double membrane under the interstice of which the aorta lies. These secondary arteries, along with very small twigs which come off from the aorta itself, some anatomists choose to describe apart under the title of posterior mediastinal arteries. 6. INTERCOSTALES 1NFERI0RES. The lower intercostal arteries are nine or ten in number, according to the number of ribs which are not supplied by the upper intercostal artery (for the upper intercostal, which comes downwards from the subclavian artery, supplies usually the intercostal spaces of the two first ribs), but sometimes of three, and sometimes of one only. The aorta, in its course down the back, gives out, as it passes each vertebra, one artery for each rib; as it goes down along the loins it still gives off an artery at the interval of each vertebra ; in the thorax they are named intercostal, and in the loins the lumbar arteries. The right intercostals are longer, because they have to mount over the ridge of the vertebrae ; the left ones are shorter, because the aorta lies on that side of the spine: the intercostals often give small twigs to the oesophagus and mediastinum ; but besides these, each intercostal artery gives three principal branches. 1. By the head of each rib it gives a small artery, which belongs entirely to the spine, and this artery sends one twig to the substance of each vertebra; an- other twig goes to the sheath or dura mater of the gpinal marrow; the third, following each intercostal nerve

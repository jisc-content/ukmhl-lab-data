OP THE BlOOt). 122 formed and discharged in halitus from the lungs; the heat, whatever is evolved, must be divided into three proportions: First, when a part of the oxygene attaches itself to the blood, heat will be evolved, which might be supposed to enter the blood : But, secondly, there is formed n the same moment a quantity of fixed air, which arises from a second portion of the oxygene uniting with the carbon of the blood; and this fixed air requires some proportion of the heat to keep it in its aerial form. Thirdly, a third portion of the oxy- gene unites itself v\ ith the hydrogene or inflammable air, and generates water; this water exhales in steam or halitus from the lungs : and how great a proportion of heat necessary to preserve water in the form of steam, is known to every tyro. Now, to prove that all the heat is expended, not upon the blood, but upon the halitus, or upon the fixed air, we have only to re- tort their own grand experiment up n the believers in this doctrine, viz. that the breath of an animal communicates the same proportion of heat to water that combustion d' >es; of course none is left to pass into the blood. These philosophers do not mean to say that respiration is as rapid as combustion, or gives out the same quantity of heat in the same spaces; there is not even any two combustions, i. e. any two inflammable bodies, which are in this respect a ike: they mean, n j doubt, to acknow edge the one to be slow and the other rapid; they mean only that the same quantities of air being used in e ach process, the same quantities of heat will be produced; that one hundred ounces of air being burnt by a taper, and the same quantity of air exhausted by the breathing of any

61 OF THE HEART. When a vein was cut, they saw nothing but gross blood, and of a darker colour ; but when an artery was cut, they observed that the blood was red ; that it Was full of air bubbles ; that it spurted out, and was full of animal spirits ; and thus it became easy for them to show how safe it was to open a vein where nothing was lost but gross blood, how terribly dan- gerous it was to open an artery which was beating with the spirit of life ; and this they considered as such an awful difference, that when arteriotomy in the temple was first proposed, they pronounced it murderous, and on this reasoning it was absolutely forsaken for many ages. But the oldest of our modem physicians soon found a necessity of mixing this blood and animal spirits toge- ther, and for a long while could hit on no convenient way by which this mixture might be effected : as a last shift, they made the blood exude through the septum of the heart; and then the current doctrine was, that of the blood which came from the liver, one half went into the pulmonic artery to nourish the lungs; the other half exuded through the septum of the heart to mix with the animal spirits.

To make good this miserable hypothesis, Riolanus, Gassendus, and many others, saw the necessity of having side passages through the sep- tum of the heart. I really believe from their mean equivocating manner of talking about these passages, that

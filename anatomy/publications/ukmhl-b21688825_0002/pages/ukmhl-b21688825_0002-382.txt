316 OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. going along it supplies the crura cerebri, and arrives at last at the place of the nates,testes,and pineal gland, and attaches itself to them. Some of the twigs go down into the fourth ventricle. 3. ARTERIA POSTERIOR CEREBRI. The posterior artery of the brain goes off im- mediately after this, is like it, runs parallel with it, is larger, goes to the posterior lobe of the brain, and receives near its root the communicating artery from the carotid, which forms the circle of Willis. Where this posterior cerebri and the anterior cerebelli run pa- rallel with each other, the third pair of nerves rises betwixt them. The posterior cerebri first gives a small twig on either side to the bottom of the third ventricle which runs so far forwards as to give branches to the thalami, centrum geminum, infundibulum, and to the crura fornicis. Then the main artery bending like that last described round the crura cerebri, and passing- deep into the great division betwixt the cerebellum and brain, arches upwards towards the back lobes of the brain ; but before it arrives there, it gives first small twigs to the crura cerebri, and then another nota- ble artery (though small) destined for the internal sur- faces of the ventricles. This is a chief artery of the cho- roid plexus j it enters the lateral ventricle by the pos- terior horn ; goes along with the cornu amonis : helps to form the choroid plexus; inosculates, of course with the choroid arteries from the carotid j and twigs also go from this artery to the nates, testes, and pineal gland, or in other words, to the velum which sepa- rates

SSfi ARTERIES OF THE EYE. the little artery which often makes a perpendicular groove in the os frontis. The chief branch of the artery continues subcutaneous, is felt beating along the forehead, belongs chiefly to the skin of the forehead and to the hairy scalp, and mounts to the top of the head, to the place of the fontanelle, where it has free inosculations with the temporal artery. This last branch is the end of the ocular or oph- thalmic artery, of which the branches are so irregular in their origin, that the most diligent anatomists have declined that part of the description, and yet have arranged the branches upon that scheme, viz. the points from which the several twigs arise : whereas I have thought it more prudent, since the branches are regular in respect of the parts which they supp*y, to arrange them according to those parts, viz. the lachrymal gland, the eyeball, the muscles, the aethmoid cells, the face ; an order which also very nearly corresponds with the order in which the arteries arise. The learning and remembering these arteries, it is right to ackndw. ledge, is a task more difficult than useful; more suit- ing the severe anatomist, than the practical surgeon ; who yet, if he do his duty, will learn all; and as he learns much, must expect to forget much. 11 ?UllWrin'J CONCLUSION.

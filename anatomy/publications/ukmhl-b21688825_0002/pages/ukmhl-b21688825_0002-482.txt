414 or THE ARTERIES OP THE the smallest, not very much larger than a crow-quill; it rises upwards, and turns a little towards the left side, because the pyloric orifice of the stomach is there. Before it reaches the pyloric orifice of the stomach, it divides itself into two great branches; one going round the cardial orifice of the stomach, and the other returning along the lesser arch. CORONARIA SUPERIOR VENTRICULI. The branch which belongs to the cardiac orifice of the stomach attaches itself to the oesophagus, just where it emerges from the diaphragm, and is joined to the stomach : the artery turns round the oesophagus, passes first under and behind it, and then turns round and appears on the forepart, or rather on the left side, of the stomach to spread over it. In the middle of this turn it gives off an artery which runs backwards along the oesophagus, takes directly the line of thecesophagus, runs up with it into the thorax a considerable way, inosculates with the upper cesophagean arteries, and though a small branch, it is long, and seldom awanting. The second branch is a continuation of the same artery encircling the cardia, sending its arteries down over the large and bulging part of the stomach, somewhat in the form of a crown. As the spleen is attached to this end of the stomach, this artery inosculates with what are called the vasa brevia, or short vessels coming from the spleen j and so it epds, having the name of CORONARIA SUPERIOR VENTRICULI. The second branch of the coronary returns along the lesser arch of the stomach ; it is so connected with the last that it may be called ramus coronariÂ© dextra.

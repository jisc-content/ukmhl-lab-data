BELOW THE GROIN. These last branches, viz. the epigastric and reflected iliac arteries, I ascribe to the internal iliac ; for the ar- tery is still within the abdomen, or at least not without the arch of the thigh. The femoral artery, until it gets down into the hol- low which I have described, gives no branches, or none with which I would choose to confound the de- scription of the profunda or great artery of the thigh. The branches which the femoral gives off before that are only small twigs to the fat, glands, skin, or pri- vate parts ; but one or two of those to the private parts are sometimes large.—First, Twigs go out along the femoral ligament, and terminates in the skin.—Se- condly, Twigs go to the fat, and lymphatic glands of the groin.—Thirdly, There ascends a small branch, sometimes towards the origin of the sartorius, to the middle glutseal muscles, and to the beginning of the fascia lata.—Fourthly, Of those branches which go across the upper part of the thigh to the genitals, and which are named pudic^e extern^: to distinguish Vol, II.

■OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID, 261 branch of the carotid, turns downwards again to touch the larynx. The first division, then, of the carotid artery is into the external and internal carotids; and the external carotid gives branches so interesting to the surgeon,- yet so numerous, that it is at once very desirable and very difficult to get a knowledge of each: arrange- ment is here of more importance than in any order of arteries, though extremely useful in all. ARRANGEMENT OF THE BRANCHES OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The external carotid gives three sets of arteries, each of which, having a plain and distinct character, cannot be forgotten, nor their direction, nor their uses, nor their relative importance, misconceived ; for if we consider but the parts along which the carotid artery passes, as 1. The thyroid gland ; 2. The tongue; 3. The face; 4. The pharynx; 5. The occiput; €. The ear; 7. The inside of- the jaws ; 8. The temple:—-if we remember thus the order of these parts, we shall not forget the order in which the branches go off. But it will be further very useful to observe, that these many branches divide themselves most naturally into three sets. 1. The branches which go off from the carotid forwards are peculiarly important; one of them goes to the thyroid gland, another to the tongue, and a third to the face; parts which, to say no more, are S 3 peculiar

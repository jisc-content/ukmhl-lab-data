OF THE BLOOD. 115 delicate and pellucid, like the swimming bladder of a fish: Even in the extremities of the human system the blood of a vein is dark, of an artery red ; so that surgeons distinguish venous and arterial hemorfhagies in this way. From these facts we may understand why the blood of the womb, of sinuses, of varices, and of all stag- nant veins, is so offensive and black; and why that blood is so very pure and florid which is coughed up from the lungs. Is not the face livid in apoplexies or strangulations, in hanging or drowning, in fits of passion or of coughing, or in any accident which inter- rupts the lungs ?

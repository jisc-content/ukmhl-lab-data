445 OF THE PELVIS. arteria trivial branches to the rectum, and to the pyramidal muscle. The branches of so great an artery, ramifying merely among muscles, and among such a vast variety of muscles, can neither be named, nor are worth naming. All that is to be desired is, to know the trunk, and the general direction in which its greater branches go. Among these branches there are few remarkable. First, The coccygeal artery turns quick back- wards upon the sciatic ligaments, and lying under the glutaeus magnus ; and passing along by the direc- tion of the ligament, it arises at that part of the sa- crum whence the ligament takes its rise; and turning downwards upon the coccyx, and upwards upon the back of the sacrum, it inosculates with the sacral arteries through the posterior holes.—Secondly, An- other branch, more remarkable for its office than its size, runs downwards along the sciatic nerve, supply- ing its coats and substance.—But the great branch of this artery sends a confused lash of arteries down- wards, which give arteries, first to the glutaeal muscles and pyriformis, and then downwards to all those muscles of the back of the thigh which arise about the knob or tuber of the ischium. In short, all its chief branches are muscular ; and the artery is remark- able for no other peculiarity than this, that its inos- culations downwards with the reflected arteries of the thigh are so frequent, that these alone may save the limb in wounds of the femoral artery above its pro- funda, or that great branch which belongs to the thigh.

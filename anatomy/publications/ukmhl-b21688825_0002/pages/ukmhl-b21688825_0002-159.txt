. 107 OF THE BLOOD. abstraction of phlogiston, but on the addition of a new principle: That they ail arise' from one positive power, that the same principle gives life to fuel, heaviness (and other effects of calcination) to metals, acidity to acids, and redness to the blood. These are all performed by one power ; they arc all essen- tially one process; they are all effected by the co?m- munication of one sole principle, viz. the basis of pure air. Upon our atmosphere and its Surprising harmony with all parts of nature; with animal and vegetable life; with water, metals, acids, and all the solid bodies into which it entersâ€”much more depends than it is easy to conceive. Could we have supposed that it was the cause, not merely of life in all living crea- tures, but almost the cause of all the properties that reside in the most solid forms ? Could we have supposed that the air rendered heavy bodies heavier, changed metals into caustic earths, converted many bodies into acids, changed inflammable air into the pure element of water, which at least we have hitherto conceived to be pure? Yet, if there be one word of truth in che- mistry, all this is true. The atmosphere contains various gases or airs; but one only, viz. vital air, is useful to respiration, combustion, and animal life; that purer air must, like every other, arise from some solid- basis: That basis cannot be shown in any substantial form, but it can be combined with many various bodies, so as to give then an increased weight and new qualities: and thence we presume to say, whenever we see a' pody, by such a process, acquiring such qualities, that

BRANOIIES OF THE 464 every side to the rectus, transversalis, obliquus; in short to all the muscles of the abdomen, and spreads its last branches very freely about the lower border of the chest. ARTER1A CIRCUMFLEXA ILEUM. THE CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY of the HAUNCH IS named circumflexa from its turning directly back- wards, and ileum from its passing along the hollow of the haunch-bone. It is smaller than a crow-quill; it goes off from the outside of the femoral artery opposite to the epi- grastic, or rather a little lower ; exactly at that point where the outer end of the Fallopian ligament begins in the haunch-bone. It runs backwards in a curved line along the hollow of the haunch-bone, curving along with the crista ilii, or ridge of the ilium, under which it lies. Its line is along the most naked part of the bone, where the internal iliac muscle begins on one hand, and the transverse muscle of the belly on the other ; in short, it runs along all the upper edge of the internal iliac muscle, quite round almost to the lumbar spine, where it joins the ileo-lumbar artery by small inosculations; for at this place the reflected iliac artery, which grows gradually and sensibly smaller, is almost spent. There are no remarkable branches which deserve to be described or even to be named, unless it be one which goes off early, near the head of Poupartâ€™s ligament, and gives branches to the ligament, to the sartorius muscle which arises at the same point of the haunch-bone, and to the edge of the iliac muscle. And as it runs along

274 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID- under the root of the mastoid process, so as to lie at this place under the belly of the digastric muscle. Still as it encircles the occiput, it passes along very deep under the bellies, first of the trachelo-mastoideus, and then of the splenius and complexus, and emerges only when it arrives at or near the middle ridge of the occiput; and lastly, it rises with many beautiful branches over the back of the head, to meet the branches of the temporal artery. In this course the occipital artery sends out the following branches: 1. Branches to the biventer which lies over it, and to the stylo-hyoideus muscle; and there is one longer artery which attaches itself to the root of the mastoid muscle, and passes along that muscle, to inosculate with the thyroid arteries, or with the lower cervical arteries, which mount upwards as this descends. 2. Next it gives, like the pharyngeal, a small artery, which goes backwards along the jugular vein; and having entered by the foramen lacerum, attaches itself within the skull to that part of the dura mater which lies under the lobes of the cerebellum. 3. The occipital artery, as it passes under the ear,1 sends out to it a small posterior artery, which goes to the little lobe of the ear, and creeps up along its pos- terior border. 4. At this point the occipital often gives another artery, which passes upwards behind the ear, and is named the posterior temporal artery. 5 The

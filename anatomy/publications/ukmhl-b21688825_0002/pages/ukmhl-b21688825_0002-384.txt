OF THE ARTERIES. 318 muscles of the neck, and inosculate with the thyroid and cervical arteries. In like manner, other small ar- teries go inwards to the spinal marrow at the place where each nerve comes out. They enter into the sheath of the spinal marrow, and inosculate with the chief arteries of the medulla spinalis. As the vertebral passes through the atlas, both above and below that bone it gives out much larger arteries to the muscles, as to the recti, trachelo- mastoideus, and complexus, inosculating largely with the occipital artery : often there is at this point one large and particular artery going out to the back of the neck. Again, as the vertebral passes through the oc- cipital hole, it gives out a little artery, which ac- companies the trunk itself up through the foramen magnum,and4goes to that part of the dura mater which covers the cuneiform process, and there it inbsculates with the twig of the carotid, which enters along with the jugular vein. This is the posterior artery of the dura mater. Next come the arteries of the spinal marrow, the anterior of which comes out from the trunk of the vertebral artery; the posterior (though it also some- times comes off from the vertebral before the basilar is formed) more commonly comes off from the poste- rior cerebelli. J. ARTERIA ANTERIOR MEDULLE SPINALIS. The anterior artery of the spinal marrow is the larger of the two. It wTas discovered first by Willis ; it had

16? OF RESPIRATION. In a little tepid water. Nay, we find a thing which is at first inconceivable to be really true, that not- withstanding the inosculations of the air-tubes with each other, which seems to provide against all such effects, when we close no the stigmata of an insect one by one, the parts become >n the same proportion paralytic; if we varnish over the stigmata of one side, that side becomes paralytic; if we varnish over the stigmata of both sides up to the last holes, the insect lives, but in a very languid condition, it sur- vives in a kind of lethargic state for two days, with- out any pulsation in its heart; if we also stop the two highest holes, it dies. Of all the examples of respiration, that which is reported by Spallanzani is what 1 most wonder at, and cannot but doubt. In acescent liquors, or the juices of animal bodies, animalcules are seen plainly with sim- ple glasses, moving sometimes rapidly, sometimes slow- ly; but never hitherto has any author pretended to see their lungs or heart. M r. Spallanzani says, â€œ that these animalcules are elliptic bodies; that in the centre of each ellip- sis he sees two stars, which are in constant alternate and regular motion, whether the creature star-like body has in its centre a small globe, and every three or four seconds the globules are blown up slowly to three or four times their natural size, and as slowly compressed again ; and every time that the ra- dii are inflated the central globule subsides. On one side of these star-like bodies there is an oval part, which is continually agitated with a trembling mo- tion ; he calls the star-like bodies lungs, and the oval M 4

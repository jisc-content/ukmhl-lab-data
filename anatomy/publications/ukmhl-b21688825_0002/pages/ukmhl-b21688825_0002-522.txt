OF THE ARTERIES. 450 It is this artery which pours out blood so freely into the cells of the penis, and causes erection. These three, the glutaeal, the sciatic, and the pudic arteries, are the only ones which go out from the pel" vis behind, and one only goes out by an opening on its orepart, viz. the obturator artery. ARTERIA OBTURATOPJA. The obturator artery is so named from its pas- sing through the thyroid hole. No artery is less re- gular in its origin; ausing sometimes .from the Iliac, sometimes from the Hypogastric, and not unfrequently from the root of the Epigastric artery: in v/hich case it turns back again over the pubis, coming into the pelvis through the ring. But no artery is more regular in its destination; a large artery always passes through the thyroid hole; the thick muscles in the centre of the thigh cannot want it. The obturator artery, arising from the iliac or hy- pogastric, runs along by the upper edge of the pelvis, by the lower edge of the psoas muscle, accompanied with the obturator nerve, which is to go through the hole along with it. Having arrived at the forepart of the pelvis, it slips through the oval hole by a very small opening, which is in the upper part of the ten- dinous membrane,, which closes that hole, and which is consequently at the upper edge of the obturator in. ternus muscles. The artery, before it passes out of the -pelvis, often gives branches of considerable side down- wards to the neck of the bladder, prostate gland, and vesiculse; to the iiiacus internus and psoas muscles, and to the lymphatic glands which lie upon them; and

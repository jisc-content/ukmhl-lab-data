OF THE MECHANISM 6 the lungs; no blood can reach the heart of the body which has not been sent to it through the lungs; or, in other words, the veins of the lungs, and they alone, feed the left side of the heart. Words alone will never explain any of the endless difficulties which concern the mechanism of tlie heart; but at every point, in every kind of difficulty, in ex- plaining the form, the parts, the posture, even the coats or coverings of the heart, I shall have recourse to plans, such as cannot fail to make all this intricate me- chanism be easily conceived. The most simple form of the heart, which is repre- sented in the Plan, N°- 1. has a vein marked (a),—-an auricle (£),—a ventricle (c),—an artery (d);—it has no provision for purifying the blood ; it has no resem- blance to that kind of heart which is connected with lungs; but the blood is received by the vein, falls-into the auricle, is driven by its force into the ventricle, by the ventricle it is thrown into the artery, and courses round all the body, till at length, reaching the extremities of the veins, it passes by the veins to the auricle a second time, and so this single circle is perfect. The heart of the amphibious creature is repre- sented in .N°* 2; it is a frog’s heart: it has the most simple form, and the fewest parts; it has the same vein, auricle, ventricle, and artery; but its great artery divides into two chief branches, of which (d)—the aorta goes to the body,—(e) the pulmonic artery goes to each side of the lungs. The heart of a breathing creature is represented in N°. 3. in its most intelligible form; and the double circulation

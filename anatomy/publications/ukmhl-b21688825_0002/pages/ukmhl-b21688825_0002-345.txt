OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 281 bone at that great hole which is betwixt the condyloid and coronary processes ; then runs all along within the jaw-bone, surrounding each of the teeth with arteries at the bottom of each socket. About the middle of the jaw-bone it divides into two branches, which proceed together in the bony canal, till one of them emerges upon the chin at the mental hole, inosculating there with the arteries of the face, viz. the labial and submental arteries, while the other goes onwards to supply the roots of the fore teeth also, and to meet its fellow within the jaw-bone at the chin. The nerve for the lower jaw enters along with this artery; the vein of this artery accompanies it, but lies under it in a separate canal, though still in the rame line. The artery itself, before it enters into the hole of the lower jaw, commonly gives twigs to the inner pterygoid muscle which covers the hole. Considering the size of this artery, we cannot wonder at profuse bleedings from the teeth, or rather from their sockets. 3. The pterygoid arteries.â€”While the artery is thus crossing betwixt the jaw and the pterygoid muscle, it gives branches to the external pterygoid muscle, both into its substance and over its surfaces. The numbed of these pterygoid arteries is variable and unimportant. Next, while the maxillary artery is passing in a contorted form under the zygoma, where the tem- poral muscle is lodged, it gives off two arteries, which are called the deep tf.mpor.al arteries, to distin- guish them from the proper temporal artery, the only one which we feel outwardly, and which is super- ficial.. Of these two deep temporal arteries, one runs more

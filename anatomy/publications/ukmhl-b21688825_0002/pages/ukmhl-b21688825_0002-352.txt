OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 288. Next the temporal artery, as it rises towards the zygoma, and of course approaches the angle of the jaw, gives an artery which is proper to the articula- tion of the jaw. This artery belonging to the joint of the jaw is often named arteria articularis. After having sent its two branches to the articula- tion of the jaw, it sends another artery to the ear, which divides into two twigs; one of them going round the back part of the ear, assists the branch of ^he stylo-mastoid artery in forming the little circular artery of the tympanum; while another branch, pene- trating through the slit which is in the articulation of the lower jaw, goes to the muscle of the malleus. But before it reaches the zygoma, the temporal artery gives another branch, which is named the middle temporal artery, to distinguish it from the deep temporal arteries which lie under the whole thickness of the temporal muscles, and the superficial temporal, which lies above the fascia; for this middle temporal artery lies under the fascia: but on the outside of the muscle it arises from the main artery just under the zygoma, rises over the zygoma, and then pierces its way under the fascia of the temporal muscle, and under that covering gives branches to the temporal muscle, the artery itself still rising and passing obliquely forwards towards the outer corner of the eye, where one of its twigs often goes to the orbicu- laris oculi, and inosculates with the ophthalmic artery. About this point, or rather above the zygoma, the temporal gives off those small arteries, irregular in number, which are named anteriokes auris, the anterior

OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 280 is called the spinous hole, which is in the very extreme point or spine of the sphenoid bone : it is this artery of which the surgeon should be particularly aware, and which touches the parietal bone at its lowest corner in the temple, and spreads from that point all over the dura mater like the branches of a tree. But besides these, its chief branches, which spread thus upon the parietal bone, on its inner surface, it gives smaller ones, which go into the substance of the bone, or into the ear, and sometimes through the orbit into the eye. Thus first several smaller twigs go into the â– "substance of the os petrosum to nourish it; the holes may be seen about the rough part, where the os squamosum and os petrosum are united; next two twigs enter into the aqueduct by the small hole on the fore part of the petrous bone, one keeping to the canal itself, the other going to the cavity of the tympanum, and to the inner muscle of the maleus; and, lastly, one or two small twigs pass through the outer end of the foramen lacerum into the orbit, and go to the lachrymal gland*. 2. The lower, maxillar artery is a slender and curious artery, which belongs chiefly to the teeth of the lower jaw, and which runs all along in a canal within the jaw-bone. The internal maxillary proceeds nearly an inch before it gives off this branch; and then, while lying under the pterygoid muscle, it gives it off a long and slender artery, which enters the jaw- / * Sometimes the great and proper artery of the lachrymal gland, instead of arising from the opthafmic or proper artery of the eye, arises thus from the artery of the dura mater. bone

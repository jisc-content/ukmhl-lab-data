Such a scene the celebrated Dr. Hunter once wit- nessed ; and there was, I perceive, in that heart a pe- culiarity very much to be admired. The chief fault was in the pulmonic artery, which was contracted in- to a solid substance or cord absolutely and completely impervious, so that the lungs had never received one drop of blood by the pulmonic artery. And here 1 must stop to notice one thing which I have always suspected, and which this dissection proves, viz. that though it is natural to believe, and the best physiolo- gists suppose it, that some blood, as much at least as to support the form of the pulmonic vessels, passes through the fetal lungs ; yet here is direct proof that a well nourished child may be born capable of breath- ing, and in which the pulmonic vessels are all free ex- cept at the heart, in which not one drop of blood ever has passed into the lungs. But chiefly it is to be ob- served, that this child, with its pulmonic artery quite impervious, could not have struggled a single day, far less ten days, without some proportion of oxydated blood! and accordingly we find that it had a small portion, just such as supported life for a few days; which small proportion it obtained thus: The blood went to be oxydated, not from the right ventricle in- to the pulmonic artery, but from the left ventricle in- to the aorta j from thence into the ductus arteriosus; and

418 or THE ARTERIES OF THE which passes under the pancreas, runs along its back part, gives its arteries into the substance of the pan- creas from side to side; and yet is not exhausted till it has run along more than two thirds of the length of this long gland. The next branch is that from which the whole ar- tery has its name: for the artery having given off the lower pyloric artery, and the transverse artery of the duodenum, turns downwards, bending according to the circle which the duodenum makes, lying in the hollow side of that circle just as other mesenteric arteries lie along their proper intestines. In all this circle it gives continual arteries outwards to the duodenum ; it gives also frequent arteries inwards to the pancreas. From these two connections this branch is peculiarly named arteria pancreatico-duodenalis. It ends in inosculation with the mesenteric artery. At the place where the pancreatico-duodenalis turns downwards, the other great branch turns backwards and upwards to reach the stomach. It is so great that it must be considered as the continuation and ultimate part of the artery. It goes to the stomach and epiploon, and thence is named gastro-epiploic artery. The course of the gastro-epiploic artery is along the lower part of the stomach, and is most beautiful; it makes a broad sweep round all the greater arch of the stomach; it lies in that line where the great omentum comes off from the stomach ; it sends many and large branches upwards upon the stomach, both on its fore and on its back surfaces; it sends opposite branches, very frequent and considerable, down into the web Of

OF THE INTESTINES. 423 intestineand the arteries lie within the two lamellse of the mesentery or supporting membrane of the in- testines, so that they are called mesenteric arteries; and they follow the intestines in the order in which I have named them. The GREAT Or SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY gives its first branches to the caput coli; its next branch to the middle of the colon under the stomach ; the thousand turns of the small intestines next absorb all its other branches. The lower mesenteric artery which gives no branches to the small intestines, at- taches itself to the left side, and especially to the lowest part of the colon, and goes down with the rectum into the pelvis, and ends there. This, then, may serve as a general plan or arrangement for the intestines and for the two mesenteric arteries. 1, MESENTERICA superior. Ir is not surprising that the upper mesenteric is the largest of all the abdominal arteries. It arises from the aorta, where it is still betwixt the legs of the diaphragm, and not more than half an inch below the cceliac artery. The cceliac and mesenteric arteries lie close upon each other ; only we are less sensible of their nearness by the axis cceliacae jutting perpendicu- larly forwards, and by the trunk of the mesenteric running very obliquely downwards, and by the head of the pancreas lying immediately over the mesenteric and hiding its root. The trunk of the mesenteric artery passes under the pancreas, then through the mesocolon E e 4 or

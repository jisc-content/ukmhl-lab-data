OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 473 last, through the flesh of the triceps magnus. Its first branch, while on the forepart of the triceps, is the nutritia magna femoris, or proper nutritious artery of the thigh-bone; and after it perforates the triceps, it gives its arteries to the two hamstring muscles, but more especially to the biceps; and so this la.4: branch of the profunda ends. But this minute description of any important set of arteries never presents any clear idea to the readerâ€™s mind, nor any knowledge which he can easily retain. I expect rather to do so by one short description. The title of perforating arteries is one which comprehends all the great muscular branches of the profunda, except the two reflex arteries belonging to the joint. They vary in number, as all muscular branches must do, and are proportioned in size and number to the bulk of the thigh. The profunda passes down along the forepart of the triceps, while it is giving off these arteries ; they must, of course, perfo- rate the triceps before they can get to the back part of the thigh. When they do perforate, they come into a great muscular interstice or hollow, which is formed by the hamstring muscles of opposite sides, by the biceps on one side, and by the semi-membrano- sus and semi-tendinosus on the other. It is to these two great muscles of the back part of the thigh that the branches of all the perforating arteries are chiefly di- rected. Each perforating artery succeeds another at about the distance of an inch or more; each suc- cessively coming out into this interstice at a lower and lower point. Each artery gives branches to the tri- ceps, &c. before it perforates, and to the hamstring muscles.

i 95 THE FOETUS. â€¢through the lungs in all states and conditions with O O equal ease * ? It is also universally believed, and it is indeed a most legitimate conclusion, from this doctrine of the collapse of the lungs hindering the passage of the blood, that if but the foramen ovale or any passage be left open to let through the blood, that person will live without breathing. It has been affirmed, that the Seal, the Beaver, the Otter, have the foramen ovale open. In the Seal, the Parisian dissectors found the oval hole open as in a child; but when they came to the foramen ovale of the Beaver and Otter, they found them, and sore against their will, quite close. In their disappointment they could have said any thing ; but all that they thought prudent to say was that the Beaver had not been in the water for a long while, not even to re- fresh himselff, and the Otter had been close penned up in his hut at Versailles; and so the foramen ovale had closed in these poor beasts quite close; and behold they were no longer Otters and Beavers, but * Their old and favourite experiment, so of;en repeated by Hooke, Croone, and others, before our Royal Society, viz. of blowing up the lungs of a Dog, and then compressing them, is good for nothing: for there the thorax is cut clean away; the permanent distention of the lungs is entirely lost; and then, no doubt, there is such a collapse of the lungs, as may, or rather must, hinder respira- tion ; for the lungs are alternately distended to the greatest degree, and then emptied as completely. t The"Beaver sits in his hut just up to the hips in the water, and builds his hut so that he may sit just up to the hips.

OF THE PELVIS. 447 before given off that branch which goes to the peri- naeum. It is this long artery, running naked and un- protected along the whole inner side of the ischium, bending as the arch of the ischium and pubis bends? that is cut by ignorant lithotomists, which a broad gorget is sure to wound, and which can be safe only by our exchanging the gorget for the knife. The branches of the pudic artery are chiefly these : —First, Before it proceeds out of the pelvis, it usually sends branches inwards to the neck of the bladder, vesiculas seminales, and prostate gland:—Secondly, When it emerges from the pelvis, and while bending over the sacro-sciatic ligament, it gives, like the sciatic artery, chiefly muscular branches; it gives twigs to the sacro sciatic ligament and pyriform muscle ; others go to the gemini muscles, and turn over them to the great trochanter, and to the hip-joint, reaching as far as the acetabulum ; others spread over the tuber ischii, to which they give arteries, which go outwards along the three muscles of the thigh which arise from this point; and it sends inwards from this part an artery which encircles the verge of the anus, and belongs to the sphincter and levator ani muscles. This branch is named the lower or external haemorrhoid a l artery : and other branches it sends forwards into the perinaeum ; but these are smaller and less regular arteries; they are not what are distinguished by the peculiar name of perinseal arteries. This artery, like the ischiadic, ends every where in inosculations with the reflected arteries of the thigh. Thirdly, The artery returning again into the pelvis, and running along under the flat internal surface of the

OF THE BLOOD. 80 and totally extinguished by cold. I am sure, that had Mr. Hunter seen these two experiments brought face to face in this manner, he would have put one of them at least back quietly into the< portfolio from which they both came. I have always observed, that your great tellers of experiments need to have good memories; and I am come to look on a suite of ex- periments as coolly as upon a set of neat plans and figures by which the author chooses to illustrate his hypothesis. That this coagulum, being once formed, has the power of becoming more perfectly alive, and forming vessels within itself, it is not easy to conceive. Nothing indeed is more common than clots of blood, or depo- sitions of the coagulable part, becoming highly vascu- lar, by vessels shooting into them from surrounding parts ; but this is of no value in Mr. Hunter’s doc- trine ; this is not the fact which he means to speak of; this is much too natural and easy for him; and that his meaning may neither be misrepre- sented nor mistaken, I quote his words; “ When new vessels are formed, they are not always elonga- tions from the original ones, but vessels newly formed, which afterwards open a communication with the original.” That a clot of mere blood should have in it a living principle, and should possess through that principle the power of forming within itself arteries and veins, a new and independent circulation ; that it should have the privilege of knowing when it should exert itself thus, is really wonderful; that it should have some kind of intelligence ; or consciousness, by which

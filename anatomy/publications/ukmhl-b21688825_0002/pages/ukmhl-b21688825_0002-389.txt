323 ARTERIES Of THE EYE. FIRST ORDER. 1. ARTERIA LACHRYMALIS. The lachrymal artery is the first branch of the ophthalmic; but, in order to know its place correctly, we must first observe how the ophthalmic artery enters the eye. It comes off from the carotid, where that artery touches the clynoid process; and is so close upon the process, that the setting off of the ophthalmic is almost covered by that projection. It then divÂ«s under the optic nerve, and appears on the outer side of it; and as the artery goes along through the orbit, it makes a spiral turn till it completely surrounds the nerve. The lachrymal artery goes off from the ophthalmic immediately after entering the orbit*, though some- times it arises from the artery of the dura mater; and then it enters by the foramen lacerum, which is the next opening to the optic hole. It goes off from the ophthalmic about two or three lines after it has entered the socket. It goes all along the outer side of the orbit, because the lachrymal gland lies in the outer corner of the eye. When it reaches the gland, it is branched out and entirely expended upon it, except that it sends some small twigs forwards to the eyelid* * Sometimes it goes off one or two lines before the ophthalmic en= ters the optic hole, sometimes from the middle of the artery.

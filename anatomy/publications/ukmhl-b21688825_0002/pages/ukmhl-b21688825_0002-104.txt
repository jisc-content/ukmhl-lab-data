Oi? THE PERICARDIUM. 52 in the child, but increasing in thickness by the con- tinual frictions of the heart, just as a capsular ligament does by the working of its joint; anditsuses are to keep the heart easy and lubricated by that exhalation which proceeds from its exhalent arteries (and not from any glands), and which can be imitated so easily by inject- ing tepid water into its arteries, to suspend the heart in some degree by its connections with other parts, especially by its connections with the mediastinum and diaphragm; and to limit the distentions of the heart, and check its too violent actions, just as we see it pre- vent too much of our injections from entering the heart.

If I have not mentioned any fluid under the di- rect name of aqua pericardii, or the water of the pericardium, it is because I consider the accident of water being found as belonging not to the healthy structure but to disease. Yet this same water occu- pied the attention of the older authors in a most ludi- crous degree.

216 OF THE BLOOD. every moment giving up to the solids; and which no other process but respiration can restore. This sti- mulant power the blood gradually loses as it circu- lates round the body; it is quite effete when it returns to the right side of the heart: the heart of a creature never moves, if we allow its lungs to lie collapsed; but the heart returns to act the very instant that pure air is forced into the lungs, and so communica- ted to the blood. This stimulant power is most of all apparent when we force a living creature to breathe nothing but the purest air; for oxygenated or vital air makes this process too rapid ; the pulse rises, the eyes become red and prominent, the creature seems drunk with the new stimulus, too great for its sy- stem. The universal heat of its body is greatly in- creased, the eyes are turgid and red, and at last a sweat breaks forth all over it; and when dead, the lungs (it is said) are mortified or inflamed. But whatever the marks are, whether these signs of in- flammation be really true, it is plain, since the crea- ture dies, that pure air is fatal by a too rapid oxy- genation of the blood. If, in our experiments upon a dying animal, we inflate the lungs with mephitic air, the heart does not act; if we inflate its lungs with common air, the heart begins to act; if we inflate its lungs with oxygene air, the heart is irritated to a still more powerful action. If we open the breast of a. Frog and stop its breath- ing, we observe, first, its pulmonic blood florid, and the heart beating strongly: Secondly, in half an hour the pulmonic blood has become dark, and the heartâ€™s motion has grown languid ; in a little, while the pul- monic

OF THE BRAIN. SOI to be hysterical merely; but upon opening the thorax, we found the heart wonderfully enlarged and crammed with a dark and grumous blood. But next a new scene opened upon us; and this enlargement of the heart appeared to arise like that of the liver, which so often accompanies fractured skull, from the languid action of the heart and torpor of all the system in those who lie even for a few days comatose. Now, for the first time, I was informed that the shock of slipping her foot had caused a sudden pain of the head; that it was pointed, confined to one single spot, incessant, accompanied with perpetual vomiting or desire to vomit, and with giddiness during the night. Upon opening the head, I found the dura mater of a most singular appearance; livid, or rather like the gizzard of a fowl, with green and changing colours. Having cut it open the pia mater appeared like red currant jelly, with fresh coagulated blood so firmly attached to it, that it seemed as if driven into its very substance and incorporated with it.

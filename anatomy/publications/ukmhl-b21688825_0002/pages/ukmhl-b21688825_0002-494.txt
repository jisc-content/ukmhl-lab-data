OF THE ARTERIES 424 or mesentery of the colon, then into the proper mesen- tery of the small intestines. It turns first to the left; and then, by a second gentle bending, it turns again towards the right side of the abdomen. It runs very low into the abdomen before it gives out any branches; and then it gives them off in the following order. From the right side it gives branches to the great intestines, of which there are three chief arteries ; but, from the left side, where it gives arteries to the small intestines, it gives innumerable branches, very large, and so inosculated with each other, that they form a sort of mesh or immense plexus in the mesentery be- fore they go onwards to the guts. The undivided trunk of the artery is very large and long; the gentle curvature of it from left to right gives k the form of an Italic f; the prodigious size of that mesh or plexus of vessels which goes to the great intestines is such as to carry the artery down to the left ilium or flank where the caput coli or conjunction of the ilium with the colon lies. It is from the convex of this gently bending arch, and from the right or outer side of the artery, that the following arteries to the great intestines go off*. The qolica media to the middle of the great intes- tine, the colica DEXTRAto the right side of the great intestine, the iueo-cqlica to, the joining of the ilium N * Often before giving off its greater arteries, the mesenteric gives to the pancreas several small arteries; and to the duode- num two or three, which are sometime? named under the title of duodenales inferiores,

490 OF the three arteries great toe, and under the beJly of that muscle, and close upon the bone ; its branches run forwards, quite up to the root of the toe, all along its metatarsal bone. The internarplantar artery has in general four branches, which all run pretty nearly in the same direction, viz. straight forwards. It gives, while under the head of the abductor, small branches, which go backwards to the joint, its capsule, and tendons, and some into the spongy sub- stance of the heel-bone ; some also to the short flexor of the foot, and to the massa carnea. But its four greater and more regular branches are these : The first lies nearer the inner edge of the foot; is the largest and most considerable ; it runs along under the inner border of the abductor; it goes quite up tp the ball of the great toe, and unites with the proper artery of the toe. As it gees along it gives small twigs to the periosteum and bone. The second resembles the former, except that it does not com0 off so early by two inches; it is of course shorter, but it passes along in the same direction, only a little distant from the first, lying along the middle of the metatarsal bone. It also advances up to the root of the great toe, and rims also into ttie proper ar- tery of the great toe (which comes from the external plantar branch), sc as to enlarge and strengthen it. The third lies still nearer to the centre of the foot, and deeper among the muscles. It runs the same ge- neral course, viz. along the side of the metatarsal bone up to the ball of the great toe, and ending like the others in the artery of the great toe; but as it lies deeper, it gives branches to the short flexor, to the tendons.

SOS OF THE ARTERIES. dura mater which covers the posterior clynoid pro- cess, and which covers the cuneiform process of the occipital bone ; it gives twigs to the 4th, 5th, and 6th pair of nerves and to the pituitary gland; in short, to all the parts at the back of the sella turcica ; it ends in inosculations with those twigs of the verte- bral artery, which come off from the vertebral before it enters the skull. \ 2. The little artery which comes out from the recep- taculum to go forwards, arises where the carotid is crossed by the 6th pair, mistaken for a nerve by those who suppose that the intercostal arises from a branch of the 5th pair. The distribution of this little artery is nearly the same with that of the first, for it belongs to the 3d, 4th, and 5th pairs of nerves, and to the pi- tuitary gland. The carotid having risen to the anterior clynoid process, gives out there a small artery, no bigger than a crow-quill, which enters directly into the orbitary hole, accompanies the optic nerve into the eye, fur- nishes the eye, the eyelids, the muscles, and the la- chrymal gland, and sends out branches upon the fore- head, viz. the frontal arteries in which it ends. This is a short history of the ophthalmic artery ; which, as it furnishes all the arteries of the eye, must be de- scribed apart. II ■ '!■ ■ DIVISION OF THE INTERNAL CAROTID. The carotid, now about to enter into the brain., divides at the sella turcica into three arteries; one ' to

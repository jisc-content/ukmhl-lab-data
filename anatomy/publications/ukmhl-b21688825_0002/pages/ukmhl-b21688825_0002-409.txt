343 ARTERIES OF THE ARM. the fingers are supplied by arteries, issuing in a radiated form. Of all these subdivisions the subclavian artery is that which seems the least important to know; and yet without a perfect knowledge of it, how shall we understand many important arteries of the neck or shoulder ? How shall we understand the anatomy of the greatest of all the nerves, viz. the sympathetic nerve which twists round it ? How shall we judge rightly of tumours near it, or of aneurisms which so often mount along this artery from the arch of the aorta until they are felt here ? Of the second division of the artery, viz. where it lies in the axilla, the import- ance is most unequivocal; since every attempt to stop haemorrhagies, by compressing this artery, requires a knowledge of it; since every full bleeding wound near this place alarms us, and requires all our know- ledge : since every tumour that is to be extirpated" opens some of its branches ; since we cannot cut off a cancerous breast, or the glands which should be taken along widi it, without cutting the thoracic arteries.—• Next the artery of the arm, simple as it is, interests us greatly. It is this simple artery which is hurt in aneurisms; it is its delicate, I had almost said capil- lary, branches, which are to establish a new circulation, and to save the limb. We have indeed no apprehen- sions of losing the limb for want of blood (the con- tinual success of our operations having established this point); yet it is most interesting to observe the extreme smallness of these branches, as an assurance to us in other cases of danger; though I do indeed believe, that there cannot in any simple wound in any Z- 4- limb

B y the simplest methods the blood can be resolved into various parts, but chiefly into these three; the red globules, which give colour to the blood; the gluten, which gives consistency and nutritious quali- ties to the blood; and the serum, which dilutes, mixes, and suspends the whole. Though the serum and gluten did not pass entirely unnoticed, the red globules were the part of the blood which first excited the attention of physicians, and seemed to promise a rich harvest of discoveries; a pro- mise which too surely never was fulfilled. The red particles have always appeared important, because they seem to give the colour, the useful qualities, and the whole character to the blood. It is by the rolling of the red particles only that we see the circulation in the microscope ; it is red blood only that we ever name as blood; and the colour of the red blood changes in health and disease.

ARTERIES OF THE EYE. 326 cross arteries inosculate with those of the retina, and are plainly the arteries which secrete and support the vitreous humour. The central artery stops when it comes to the back of the lens: it is scattered in a radiated form, as if by the resistance, into a great many branches. These branches go round all the capsule of the lens, and meet again on its fore part; where, uniting into one or more small arteries, they pass onwards into the opening of the pupil, and help to form that membrane which in the foetus shuts out the light, protects the eye, and vanishes very gradually. So the arteria centralis retinae passes first through the centre of the optic nerve; next through the centre of the vitreous humour; next, after going round the capsule of the lens, it passes through the posterior chamber of the aqueous humour, and terminates in the centre of the pupil. But as these last arteries, viz. of the pupil, vanish soon after birth, we may con- sider the central artery as ending in inosculations with those arteries, which coming upwards along the sides of the eye along with the retina, form a strong circle of arteries at the root of the ciliary process. 2. ARTERI.E CILIARES. The ciliary circle is known, upon looking outwardly at the eye, by that white line which borders the iris, and separates the iris or coloured part of the eye from the white or colourless part. That circle marks the place where there is a great concourse of arteries. The corpus ciliare, or ciliary body, is the part within the

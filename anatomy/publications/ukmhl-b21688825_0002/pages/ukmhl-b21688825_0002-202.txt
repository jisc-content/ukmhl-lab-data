At (a) is seen its tongue of prodigious length; it is not like the tongue of any other crea- ture, hinged far back in the mouth, but is fixed in the chin to increase its length, while at the further end it is forked. We see it saunching out this monstrous tongue in catching flies; perhaps also with this it rakes mud. At (Â£), behind the root of the tongue, is the slit-like opening of the trachea; this is what is called the glottis in the human subject. We see this rima open- ing and gasping for air when we keep the mouth thus distended; it has no epiglottis or valve to defend it; its own contraction is sufficient, for when closed you cannot even guess at its place ; besides, the jaws force down the air into it, and the long tongue carries the food over it into the gullet. At (c) is seen the opening of the gullet, which when dilated is as wide as its jaws; it looks more like the stomach opening directly into the throat; and this great width requires a very strong muscle to contract it, and makes a great circle of rugae. At (d) is seen the most important part of all, the nostril of the Frog, with which it continually breathes, never opening its mouth.

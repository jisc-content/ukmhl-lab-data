OF THE ARTERIES 454 wards again, meets the inclined line of the sartor ins and follows its oblique direction, assuming a new character; for now it becomes a second time quite superficial, is covered by nothing besides the stro n fascia of the thigh and by the skin. It is felt beat- ing along the line of the sartorius muscle ; and by that line we apply the cushion of our tourniquet. It retires from our feeling only about two hands breadth, of a little more, above thejoint of the knee ; at which place It perforates the triceps or great muscle of thâ€™e thigh, gets from the fore to the back part, or, in other words, forsakes the thigh to go down behind into the ham, where it exchanges its name for that of popliteal artery. The popliteal artery, when it has got into the ham, meets with its corresponding nerve, which is of vast size ; and the artery lies now flat upon the back part of the thigh-bone, passes down in a hollow formed betwixt its great condyles, lies flat upon all the back of the knee-joint, is enclosed by the two great ham- string muscles from above, and by the two great heads of the gastrocnemii muscles below. But although we say it is protected, yet in truth it is not tightly bound down by a fascia embracing it, but lies on the contrary so loose and unsupported among the cellular substance, that we have the most certain evidence of its being often racked and strained in sudden or awkward mo- tions of the joint. from the ham the artery descends into the leg, un- der the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles ; and being lodged behind the great bulging, or head of the tibia, felow the joint, it there divides into three great arte- ries*.

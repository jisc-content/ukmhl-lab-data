58 OF THE HEART, right auricle the c< ultimum moriens,” or the part which died last; for, upon opening the body soon after death, he found the right auricle filled with blood, and still palpitating with the remains of life, when all the other parts seemed absolutely dead3 and if the blood always accumulates in the right side of the heart before death, it is plain that the stimulus of that biood will preserve the remains of life in the right side, after all appearance of life on the left side is gone. But the cause of this accumulation of blood in the right side is very ill explained by Ilaller, though it seems to have employed his thoughts during half his life. He says that in our last m aments we breathe with difficulty; the lungs at last collapse, and cease to act; and when they are collapsed, no blood can pass through them, but must accumulate in the right side of the heart. That there is really no such collapse of the lungs, I propose hereafter to show 3 but, in the meanwhile, this is the true reason, viz. that when the ventricles of the heart cease to act, and the beating of the heart sub- sides, the two auricles lie equally quiet, but in very different conditions ; the right auricle has behind it alj the blood of the body pouring in from all parts during the last struggles 3 but the left auricle has behind it nothing but the empty veins of the lungs3 nothing can fill it but what fills the vessels of the lungs ; or, in other terms, nothing, can fill the left auricle but the stroke of the heart itself 3 but instead of acting, the heart falls into a quiescent state, the left auricle re- mains empty, while the blood oozes into the right auricle from all the extremities of the body till it fills it up.

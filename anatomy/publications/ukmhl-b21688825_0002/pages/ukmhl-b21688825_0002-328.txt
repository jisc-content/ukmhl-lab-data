264 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. the cricoid, and there gives little arteries to the mastoid muscle, jugular vein, and skin. 3. There is another branch which proceeds fre- quently enough from this second one: it belongs- entirely to the larynx, for which reason the thyroid is often named the superior laryngeal artery: it dives immediately betwixt the cartilages of the larynx; it enters betwixt the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, carries in along with it a twig from the eighth pair of nerves ; it gives its twigs to the epiglottis, and to all the small muscles which lie under cover of the thyroid cartilage, and which move the little arytenoid car- tilages ; and then passes outward emerging from the larynx, and appears again supplying the cryco- thyroideus muscle. 4. The fourth branch of the thyroid is properly the main artery, or continuation of this branch into the substance of the thyroid gland; it applies itself to the sfde of the gland, nourishes its substance by a great many small branches into which it is divided. These branches are all oblique, tending downwards and for- wards. Their course is upon the side of the gland, because, indeed, the gland consists chiefly of two lateral lobes, and hardly any of the gland, or only a small por- tion crosses the trachea; consequently this artery does not inosculate so much with its fellow of the opposite side as with the lower thyroid, which comes from the axillary artery, and whose branches, mounting upon the lower part of the gland, have pretty nearly the same degree of obliquity with those of the upper thyroid. 2, ARTERIA

20J THE HEART. and then, by a retrograde course, backwards through the lungs; and then by the pulmonic veins it was re- turned oxydated into the left side of the heart, from whence it came. This child accordingly lived a few days, and could not live longer; because this difficult circulation was continually accumulating a quantity of black blood in the right side of the heart. Tills child, then, had a heart resembling that of the Newt or Frog; for the pulmonic artery was closed, and the right heart of no value; the left heart pushed its blood into the aorta, and the aorta, as we may express it, sent a side branch into the lungs. In this first instance, then, of malconformation, the child could not live, because it wanted t e pulmonary artery, and of course the office of the right ventricle: it had but a single heart. Next to this disorder of the pulmonic artery, viz. being obliterated o’-ao>eing closed, is this: That the aorta, in place of arising distinctly either from the right or from the left ventricle, is so placed, that its root stands directly over the septum ventriculorum, or partition of the ventricles ; that the partition is per- forated with a large hole, opening a very free passage from side to side; and that the hean being cut up, we find, upon thrusting down the finger into the aorta, that it passes with equal ease into the right or into the left side of the heart—All which we are the less surprised at, when we remember that in the Chick in ' ovo, the parts of the heart are all separate pieces, which are joined ope to another; and that in the foetus of other creatures, in the Frog for example, the auricle, ventricle,

ARTERIES OF THE EYE. SSI optic nerve, the periosteum of the orbit, and some- times to the adnata and lower eyelid. FOURTH ORDER. The set of arteries which stand next in order are those which go down into the nose through the aeth- moidal bone, whence they are named aethmoidal arteries. The aethmoidal arteries are, like the other branches of the ophthalmic, pretty regular in their destination, but far from being regular in the manner in which they arise. ^ 1. ARTERIA JETHMOIDALIS POSTERIOR. The posterior aethmoidal artery is so named because it passes through the posterior of two holes which are in the orbit at the joining of the aethmoidal with the frontal bone*. It is an artery by no means regular in its place, coming sometimes from the oph- thalmic trunk, sometimes from the lachrymal artery, very rarely from the supra-orbitary artery. It is of no note: it is the smaller of the two aethmoidal arte- ries j it goes through its hole, and is scattered upon the bones and membranes of the nose. While it is circulating its twigs among the aethmoidal cells, it * In describing the skull, these are named the internal orbitary holes. inosculates.

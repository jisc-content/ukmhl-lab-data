OF RESPIRATION. 140 in the very sentence in which he informs us that “ it is perforated in many places with holes of a considerable sized’ Since Mr. Hunter is so bold as to say of other authors, that they have too limited notions of a dia" phragm, we may be allowed to say, that his notions of it are as much too liberal as theirs are too confined. But descriptions and arguments of this kind, where the author is entirely wrong, should not be tediously refuted, nor answered in any other way than by a simple statement of the case*. The anatomy of a fowl’s respiratory organs is plainly this.—The trachea having descended into the thorax, divides into two branches; of which one goes in a simple and ordinary manner into each side of the lungs. The heart, which lies immediately up* on this division of the trachea, sends into the lungs two great pulmonic arteries, and receives in return two veins. The lungs themselves are very small, dense, and bloody; they are somewhat of the shape * For the respiration of birds, /, e. for raising and depressing the thorax, 1 see many muscles having a very strong analogy with those of Man. The pectoral muscles are amazingly strong, and their scapulas absolutely fixed, so that these could raise the breast with great power; but I suspect that no such power is needed, that the elasticity merely of the sternum and ribs raises them. There lies under these, upon the back, a very strong muscle like our serratus posticus. There lies on the inside of the ribs a set of three beautiful muscles like large intercostals ; they are quite in- sulated from, all other parts, are seen instantly upon opening the belly: these are what Mr. Hunter calls Muscles of the Diaphragm; but in truth the breast of a bird is pulled down strongly by its short yet strong abdominal muscles, and rises again by its own elasticity with little help; and these are merely intercostal muscles,

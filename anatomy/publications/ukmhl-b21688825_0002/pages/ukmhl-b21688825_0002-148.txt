OF THE BLOOD. 96 as in living animals; and view it only as that parti- cular form of matter which nature has wisely appointed for our chief nourishment and support.* THE SERUM, The serum is the thinnest and most fluid part of the blood, which dilutes the other parts, and receives all those extraneous substances which often circulate in our system: this must be kept in view when its properties are to be told, for though it so exactly resembles the white of an egg, that some have in com- * It will easily be perceived, that here I choose to sink, in this general description, all those lesser distinctions which are so im- perfectly proved. Distinctions betwixt the gluten and the albu- men or serum in animals, or betwixt the vcgeto animal gluten and the starch in vegetables, I hold to be very vain; these are but various stages of the same product; what is less perfect in the albumen, is more perfect in the gluten; and a little more or a little less of the oxygene or acidifying principle, makes perhaps all the difference: these parts, as they are more or less perfect, contain more or less of this principle, and are more or less ready to congeal; both kinds of jelly, when treated with nitrous acid, give out azotic gas; azotic gas, united wiLh hydrogene gas, forms the volatile alkali; and the giving out of this azotic gas to nitrous acid, or the forming of the volatile alkali in the act of putrefying, are the chief tests by which animal matter is known. Then to make formal distinctions betwixt the tendinous and the fleshy parts of animals, and to call the first gelatinous and the latter glutinous parts, as formed of the proper gluten, seems very vain ; and not less so to make essential distinctions betwixt the gelatinous parts of vegetables and those of animate, since the slight change of proportion of azot or oxygene must make the whole difference when these vegetable jellies are assumed into the living system and completely analysed. paring

32 8 ARTERIES OF THE EYE. the from one source, sometimes from another, but most commonly from the muscular branches; and. they go along with the muscles, and consequently enter the eymat its fore part just where the recti muscles are inserted. But, though small, these anterior ciliary arteries are of considerable number. From the places at which these several arteries enter the ball, one might guess a priori how they will be distributed through its coats. First, The short ciliary arteries do not all of them arise from the ciliary trunk; but of this great num- ber of very small arteries, many arise from the mus- cular branches. As soon as they touch the eyeball, they enter into it near the insertion of the optic nerve, pass through the sclerotic coat (leaving for its nou- rishment a few twigs ; they divide so, that just after they have entered, we can. count twenty-five or thirty all round the root of the optic nerves, which go forwards in a radiated form, and are completely dif- fused upon the choroid coat, which they cover with an inner membrane, or rather tissue of vessels, named tapetum, or tunica Ruysehiana. This coat of vessels lines the choroid all the way forward to the lens, goes still onwards to the fore part of the lens; and then turning down upon the lens at right angles, it meets with the anterior vessels, and forms the ciliary circle, and the ciliary processes or radii, which are about thirty; so that the short ciliary arteries having formed about thirty branches in entering at the back part, they now terminate by a like number at the fore part, of the eye. A few twigs go still forward upon

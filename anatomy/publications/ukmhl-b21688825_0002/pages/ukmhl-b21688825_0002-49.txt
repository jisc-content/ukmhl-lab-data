OF THE HEART. 9 body.—(A) Is the aorta or great artery of the body, arising from this left ventricle, just as the pulmonic artery arises from the right: the left ventricle, by its strong and sudden stroke, not only delivers itself of its own blood, but propels all the blood of the body, communicates its vibratory stroke to the extremest vessels, and excites the whole ; this is the greater circle or circulation of the body, as opposed to the shorter cir- culation or lesser circle of the lungs. That there are strictly two hearts, is now clearly made out; they are as different in form as in office; there are two distinct hearts, two systems of vessels, two kinds of blood, and two circulations. These two hearts might have done their offices, though placed in the opposite sides of the breast, it is in order to strengthen mutually the effect of each other that they are joined ; for the fibres of the two hearts intermix ; they are both inclosed in one membranous capsule, viz. the pericardium; the veins, auricles, ventricles, and ar- teries, correspond in time and action with each other, and harmonize in a very beautiful manner. But this, I believe, will be more easily explained by marking the succession of motions, by a suite-of figures placed upon the several parts of the heart, by which the successive motions are performed. In N° 4. I have joined the right and left hearts; both that it may be seen' how the left heart locks in behind the right heart, how the right heart comes to be the anterior one, and'how the aorta seems to arise from the centre of the heart while its root is covered by the great artery of the lungs; and also that the synchronous parts, i. e.„ the parts which beat time with each other, .may be correctly seen,—1.

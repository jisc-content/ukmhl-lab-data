OF RESPIRATION. 152 bear any other kind of injury with equal ease, and could live two days without their heart or their head. FOURTH SPECIES OF RESPIRATION, VIZ. THAT OF FISHES. In this species of respiration the creature breathes nebher water nor air, but water mixed with air, and this v'ffice is performed by gilis in place of lungs. Ihe reason why 1 have called this a species of re- spiration, needs to be very fully explained; for, though little observed, it is a certain fact, that a creature, without any apparent change upon its system, can do well*, having its blood oxygenated at one time by gills, at another time by lungs. The Frog, for example, lives longâ€™ in the water; while it does so, it may be considered as a foetus which cannot breathe: the young frog which has not yet acquired its proper and natural respiration, breathes like a fish. For the first fourteen days after hatching from the egg, and while the Tadpole is very small, it has gills, which are two long, projecting, fimbriated appendages like fins; by the thirty-sixth day these appendages are taken into the jaws, and form four rows of gills on each side, regular, and like those of a fish; but at the same time, this foetus has its lungs within the body, not to be used till it come out into the air, when the lungs assume their function and the gills shrink. The same system in this instance, which was at first served by gills, is in the end oxygenated bylungs. The motion of the gilis in fishes is a true and per- fect respiration: for, in the first place, if there be no

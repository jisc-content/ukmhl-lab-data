I believe a 2 DR. JAMES JEFFRAY, PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW. Dear Sir, 'When this volume first appeared, you mentioned to me some doubts concerning the office which I hadascribed to the Eustachian t. # # valve. You proposed to publish some critical observations on this part of my Book, and, with a liberality becoming our common profession, and your high station in it, you spoke of ad- dressing those strictures to myself. It is no small gratification to me, that I have it now in my power to present a new Edition of this Volume, imperfect as it is, to one who allows it some merit, while he is yet not insensible to its defects.

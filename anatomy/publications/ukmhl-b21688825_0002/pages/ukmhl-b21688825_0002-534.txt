462 BRANCHES OF TH® exposed, and most dangerous, and by all this the most important, artery in the body; and from these previous hints and general descriptions, the value of the several branches which are now to be enumerated will be more easily felt and understood. BRANCHES OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. ABOVE THE GROIN. The femoral artery above the groin, that is, just before it passes from under the socro-sciatic liga- ment, gives off two very singular arteries, which turn backwards and never appear in the thigh; the one, going upon the forepart of the belly on the inner side, is the epigastric artery; the other, turning backwards along the inner surface of the haunch-bone, is named circumflexa ilicum. ARTERIA epigastric a. The epigastric artery, so named from its run- ning up along the belly, goes off from the inner side of the femoral artery about an inch before it passes out into the thigh. The epigastric, when first given off, turns down- wards with a full round turn till it touches Poupart’s ligament. The peculiarity of its course here must'be very carefully attended to. The femoral artery, lies at the very outer margin* of the opening, called the crural arch. The Fallopian ligament forms the upper * Viz. that end of the slit or arch which is newest to the haunch-bone. line

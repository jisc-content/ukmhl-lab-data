CHAP. II. OF THE ARTERIES OF THE ARM. The subclavian arteries arise from the arch of the aorta. The left subclavian arises from the extremity of the arch, and just where the aorta is turning down towards the spine. It is longer within the thorax, runs more obliquely to pass out of the chest, receives in a less favourable direction the current of the blood. But the right subclavian arises from the aorta by that artery which is called the arteria innominata ; for it is an artery which can have no name, being neither the carotid nor the subclavian, but a trunk common to both. It is large, rises from the top of the aortic arch, receives the blood in the most direct manner; from which physiologists have deduced those conse- quences which have been already explained*. The artery of the arm, as it proceeds, changes its name according to the parts through which it passes, It is named subclavian within the breast, axillary in the arm-pit, brachial as it goes down the arm, and * Douglas says the left i* shorter, which I can by no means understand. when

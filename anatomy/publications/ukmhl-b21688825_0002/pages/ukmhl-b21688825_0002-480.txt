412 OF THE ARTERIES OF HIE small arteries to the capsulae renales, and to the oeso- phagus and neighbouring parts j the cesophegean branch running upwards into the thorax, to inoscu- late with the upper arteries of the oesophagus. 5 3. OF THE ARTERIES OF THE STOMACH, LIVER, AND SPLEEN. The upper part of the abdomen is occupied entirely by the stomach, liver, and spleen ; the stomach in the middle, the liver on the right hand, and the spleen on the left. The coeliac artery supplies all these parts; it rises up from the forepart of the aorta a short thick artery encircled by the lesser arch of the stomach; and immediately splits into three branches, of which the middle branch goes to the stomach, the left goes to the spleen, the right goes to the liver ; and thus we have all the branches of the coeliac artery neatly and simply arranged. ARTERIA CCELIACA. The coeliac artery is so important, that its place and connections must be more minutely described. It arises from the forepart of the aorta, just at that place â€˜where the aorta is closely embraced by the crura dia- phragmatis, and over the eleventh vertebra of the back; it juts directly forwards, almost at right angles from

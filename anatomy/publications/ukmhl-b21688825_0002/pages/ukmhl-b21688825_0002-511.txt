441 OF THE PELVIS. ALTER IA HJEMORRHOIDEA MEDIA. The middle hsemorrhoidal artery is not a large branch. Often we do not find it, but other arteries supplying its place; sometimes again it is so large as to p-ive off both the uterine and the lateral sacral arte- O ries ; but in general it is small. It comes off from the hypogastric opposite to the glutaeal artery (presently to be described); it touches the rectum below its mid- dle, and descends curling and winding chiefly along its forepart quite to the anus; and often it gives, as it runs betwixt the rectum and bladder, arteries to the bladder, prostate gland, and vesiculas seminales. It is this artery also which in Women gives small branches to the vagina. ARTERIA UTERINA. The womb has four arteries, two from each side; the uppermost that which enters by the upper corners of the womb, comes from the aorta, corresponds with the spermatic in Man, runs along the broad ligament towards the ovaria. The lower artery of the womb, and the largest, comes from the hypogastric, enters the womb, where it is connected with the vagina, and runs upwards along the sides of the womb to meet the spermatic ; and it sends also at the same time branches downwards into the vagina, and forwards upon the bladder, where it adheres to this part of the womb. This uterine artery arises from the hypogastric be- side the origin of the hsemorrhoidal artery, and when it enters the womb it becomes very tortuous. These,

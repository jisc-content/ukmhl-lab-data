29 OF THE HEART. the and had proceeded to inspect, not 'the heart, but all the viscera of the body, they would have found their injections exuding from every surface ; of the pleura, and lungs ; of the peritoneum, and intestines ; of the brain, and dura mater; of the mouth, and tongue ; and universally through the cellular membrane of the whole body ; but if any coarse injection, as tallow or wax, be used, it does not exude this way, but, fol- lowing its natural course, keeps within the arteries and veins, and sometimes finds its way back to the auricle of the heart. Du Verney was so far engaged in this question, that having an opportunity of dissecting the heart of an elephant, he tied up the coronary arteries and veins, washed and cleaned very thoroughly the cavities of the heart; and then tried, by squeezing, and all kinds of methods, to make that blood which was tied up in the coronary arteries and veins exude upon the inner surface of the heart, but with no effect. On the present occasion, a theoretical answer happens to be as satisfactory as the most correct experiments ; and it is this. If there really were to be formed (by disease for example) those numerous openings which Thebesius and Veussens describe, then the blood flow- ing all by these shorter and easier passages, none could come to the great coronary vein j its office would be annihilated, and itself, contracting gradually, would soon cease to exist.

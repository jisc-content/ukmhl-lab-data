121 OF THE BLOOB* have done: by which he proved much more than he intended; for he proved plainly by this, that all the heat which respiration can possibly generate is by the fixed air carried from the lungs, and he forgot to reserve any for going into the blood. This slip of Dr. Crawfordâ€™s leads us to perceive what becomes of any proportion of heat that may be gene- rated in the lungs. In the first place, vhis respiration is not a rapid but a slow and gradual oxydation, for the quantity of pure air in the atmosphere is small. It is not a perfect oxydation, the blood bearing no marks of an acid, nor its oxydation causing any heat, Jt is not a fair nor permanent oxydation; for blood soon loses its colour out of the body, and within the body it returns very quickly from the extremities of the circulating system into the heart, deprived of all its. oxygene. T he oxygene seems but slightly attached to the blood; it is not so much united with the blood as conveyed by it; and perhaps it is only when this principle is taken from the blood, and assimilated with the several parts of the body, and fixed among its solids, that it gives out heat. This process of. oxy da- tion is intended rather for conveying new properties to the blood than for generating heat, and its chemical changes happen not so much in the lungs as in the extremities of the bodv. 4 But allowing it to be a perfect combination, a full oxygenation of the blood, and that this, like every other oxygenation, must give out heat exactly proportioned to the quantity of spoiled air, it is easy to perceive how - this heat may be bestowed; for in respiration there is always a generation of fixed air; there is much water formed

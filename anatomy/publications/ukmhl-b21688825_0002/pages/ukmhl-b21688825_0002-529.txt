4 51 OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. we also perceive, notwithstanding the doubts and fears of some modern surgeons, that when the femoral ar- tery is wounded, it is after all only a wound of the artery of the leg. Fourthly, The large branches which the profunda sends upwards round the haunch, inosculating with the sciatic and pudic arteries, and the branches which it sends downwards to the knee, inosculating round that joint with the arteries of the leg, make this branch of peculiar importance to the surgeon ; for when the artery is wounded in the groin, above the profunda, this branch saves the thigh, by its inosculations round the haunch; and when the ar- tery is wounded in the thigh, below the profunda, or in the-ham, it saves the leg by its inosculations round the knee jp and when the whole line of the femora! ar- tery has been obliterated, it has saved the whole ex- tremity, as I have elsewhere proved, by receiving the blood from the arteries round the haunch, and con- ve ing it down to the arteries below the knee, being thus an intermedium betwixt the internal iliac artery and the arteries of the leg, capable of forming a new line of circulation behind the thigh when that before is shut up. Nor should it be forgotten, that the aneurism on the forepart of the thigh may be from the profunda $â€¢ and then the femoral artery which lies be- fore it may be cut across by a rash or ignorant sur- geon. Fifthly, The place of the femoral artery passing through the triceps muscle is next to be observed, for these reasons. At that point it lies close upon the bone; and as this happens exactly at that distance above the knee at which we usually amputate, we expect in such

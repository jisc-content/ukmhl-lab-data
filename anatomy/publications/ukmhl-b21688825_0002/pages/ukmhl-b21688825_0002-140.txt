OF THE BLOOD. 88 the red globules are engaged in this clot, and give it colour; the serum may be poured off, the coagulum may be washed till it is freed of the red parts of the blood; and then the red particles are found in the water with which the coagulum was washed, and the coagulum remains upon the strainer, little reduced in size, pure and white, the gluten or fibrous part of the blood. Or we may separate this part by a method which Ruysch first taught us; we may, while the blood is congealing, stir it with a bunch of rods, when the pure and colourless gluten gathers upon the rods and the serum, with the red particles suspended in it, remains behind. OF THE RED GLOBULES. The red globules, as wre have observed,are not uni- versal ; yet in all creatures, even in colourless insects, there seem to be formal particles in the blood; in white insects, they are white, in green insects they are green, in most insects they are transparent. The red globules of the human blood are easily seen; they are best examined with a simple lens, the globules being diluted in serum, and laid upon an in- clined plane, riot in water which dissolves them quick- ly, but in serum, which has the property of preserving their globular form—The size of the particles of the blood varies in various creatures; in the foetus, they are bigger than in a grown animal; and«although Leeu- wenhoek thought it essential to his doctrine, to say, that they were alike in all creatures, we know beyond a doubt that there are in respect to the size of the animals

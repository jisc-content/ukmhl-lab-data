OF THE HEART, mg in ail the extremities of the body, like various branches of one tube, the whole is a circle, and the heart is the central power. If an animal do not breathe, its system will be what I have now described; â€¢ it will have but one vein, one auricle, one ventricle, one artery; it will have one simple heart: but with us, and other breathing ani- mals, it is not so; and I am now to describe a more complex and curious circulation. For suppose this blood so essential to our existence, to have jin it some principle of life, which is continually lost, that principle must be continually renewed : the heart, which fills the arterial system, must not be taken from its appointed office, nor disturbed ; nature appoints a second heart, which belongs entirely to this most im- portant of all functions, viz. renewing the blood; and it may be renewed in many various ways. It might, for example, circulate in some peculiar viscus like the liver or spleen ; in the foetus it does circulate in such a mass, for the placenta is a thick and flat cake, whose office we know to be equivalent to that of the lungs, but whose structure we do not understand: in the chick we see its blood circulating over the yolk (for the yolk is inclosed within the membranes of the un- hatched chick), and we perceive the blood redder as it returns to the heart, and plainly changed: in fish we find the blood circulated over the gills, exposed thoroughly to the water in which they swim, and thus the gills perform to them the function of lungs. But in all breathing creatures, the lungs do this of- fice ; the lungs are, nekt to the heart itself, essential to fife; in those who die from bleeding, we can perceive B 2 from

396 OF THE ARTERIES 2&TERIA PALMARIS PROFUNDA. The third branch of the radial artery, and that by which it ends, immediately succeeds the artery of the thumb. It crosses the palm of the hand so as to form the deep arterial arch, or the radial arch of the palm; it lies under the aponeurosis, and all the tendons and muscles close upon the metacarpal bones. Having gone its circle so as to complete the arch, and having arrived at the root of the little finger, or rather lower, near the pisiform bone, it turns backwards with a sudden ser- pentine turn, and enters into the side of the ulnar arch, so as to make a complete inosculation. This deep palmar arch gives out many arteries; but as it lies close upon the bones, they are all of the smallest order of arteries, and go only to the bones, and to the joints, of the carpus and metacarpus. Those branches again which run upwards, give little arteries to the in- terossei muscles, to the lumbricales, to the long tendons, and to the interstice of each bone. Small twigs are sent through to the back of the hand, which are named arteriae perforantes, and which inosculate with the dorsalis carpi, or artery of the back of the wrist; they also inosculate with the arteries of the fingers. ARTJERIA ULNARIS. The ulnar artery, both from its size and its direction, is to be considered as the continued trunk. It dives downwards and backwards into the trian- gular /

CIRCULATION OF 194 tion; as coughing, laughing, crying, or running do. But this great mass is seldom so moved; it is regularly and gently agitated by the change cf 40 parts of the 220 \vhich we expire and draw in again at each breath: we do not empty and fill the lungs at each breath; there is on the contrary, a permanent expansion of the lungs, and a mass of air always in them; there is along with this a gentle and regular agitation; andthere is changed at each respiration a small proportion of this mass of air. Our lungs are little different (in respect of distention) from those of Amphibiae: for their lungs also, as I have described in the Frog, are permanently expanded, and at each respiration a little dilated and contracted; the air a little changed, a little moved, a little renewed; the change is in both cases placid and gentle, and hardly to be perceived. ' With these opinions concerning the state of our lungs, nothing can appear to me more coarse than the notion of their being entirely filled and emptied at each breath; nothing more ignorant than the sup- posing them to fall flat, as Hales expresses it, so as to hinder the motion of the blood: and the s:ross- ness of this opinion appears in its true light when I put down this last proof, viz. that for each act of re- spiration there are four pulses of the artery, or four strokes of the heart. Is it not plain, then, to the meanest apprehension, that if the blood moves twice through the lungs in expiration, and twice during in- spiration ; or, in other words, if there be four strokes of the artery for each respiration, and if each of the four pulses be equally strong, that the blood pass.es through

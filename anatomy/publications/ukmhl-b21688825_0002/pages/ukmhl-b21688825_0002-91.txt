OF THE HEART. 43 mathematics, and all those parts of science which have nothing to do with the philosophy of the human body, refined upon this theory most elegantly; for observing that the nerves of the heart turned round the aorta, and passed down betwixt it and the pulmonic artery, he explained the matter thus: “ These great arteries, every time they are full, will compress the nerves of the heart, and so stop this nervous fluid, and every time they are emptied (a thing which he chose to take for granted, for in truth they never are emptied), they must leave the nerves free, and let the nervous fluid pass down to move the heart.” Des Cartes, who studied every thing like a right philosopher of the old breed, viz. by conjecture alone, supposed that a small quantity of blood remained in the ventricle after each stroke of the heart; which drop of blood fermented, became a sort of leaven, and operated upon the next blood that came into the heart “ like vitriol upon tartar;” so that every suc- cessive drop of blood which fell into the ventricle swelled and puffed up so suddenly as to distend the heart, and then burst out by the aorta. Philosophers have been so bewitched with the desire of e> plaining the phenomena of the human body, but without diligence enough to study its structure, that from Aris- totle to Buffon, it is all the same, great ignorance and great presumption. But on this subject of the pulse of the heart, physicians almost surpassed the philosophers in the absurdity of their theories, till at last they were reduced to the sad dilemma of either giving up speak- ing upon this favourite subject, or of contenting them- selves with saying, “ that the heart beat by its facultas pulsifica.

34 i ARTERIES OF THE ARM. Z 3 twigs when it divides at the bending of the arm, its two branches are named the radial and ulnar arteries, after the radius and ulna, along which they run, until at last they join to form vascular arches in the palm of the hand. Nature has thus arranged and divided the parts of this artery; and the study of its branches becomes easy to those who will first condescend to observe this simple arrangement and the parts through which it goes. 1st, While the artery is within the breast, it lies transversely across the root of the neck; it supplies the neck, the breast, the shoulder; it gives all its branches upwards into the neck, or downwards into the breast: upwards it gives the vertebral to the inside of the neck (if I may use an expression which cannot now be misunderstood); the cervical, which goes to the outside of the muscles of the neck; the thyroid, which goes to the thyroid gland. While it gives off from its opposite side downwards, and into the chest, the mammary, which goes to the inner sur- face of the breast; the upper intercostal artery which serves the space betwixt the uppermost ribs; the mediastinum and pericardium; and even the diaphragm, though far distant, receives branches from this mam- mary artery. 2. When the artery, having turned over the sloping part of the chest, glides into the axilla, and lies deep there betwixt the scapula and the thorax, what parts can it supply, or what vessels can it give off, but sca- pular and thoracic arteries ? Its branches accordingly are three or four slender arteries to the thorax on one hand, named the four thoracic arteries, which give

292 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. maxillary artery; but it has besides small assisting' arteries, entering by almost every point at tl basis of the skull; and especially it has arteries from the maxillary, by the mouth of the Eustachian tube, from the pharyngeal, running in by the hole for the great jugular vein; and from the occipital both by the hole of the jugular vein in the basis of the skull, and also by the small occipital hole in the back part of the skull, close by the temporal bone. The throat also, though it has many peculiar arteries, derives its branches from a great many sources; as from the lingual artery by twigs, which cross the root of the tongue; from the labial artery by branches, which go to the tonsil, tongue, and palate; from the pharyngeal artery, many branches not confining themselves to the pharynx, stretch forwards to the palate, tongue and tonsils; and lastly, the maxillary artery gives a pro- fusion of branches to all parts of the throat. These V may serve as hints by which the student, if he wishes to become a correct anatomist, may trace the inoscula- tions ; or for the surgeon, if he wishes to separate the study of this minute anatomy from that of the greater arteries. The surgeon’s interest in understanding these arte- ries is, indeed, very strong. It were impossible to enumerate all the various occasions on which this piece of anatomy may be useful; but, surely, one may easily say enough on this subject to attach the young surgeon to the diligent study of these arteries. Among the various motives for diligence, I would mention these; the terrible hamorrhagies which he is daily called to stop, when, suicides, though they have ’ not

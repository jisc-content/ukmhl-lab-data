327 ARTERIES OF THE EYE, the eye which lies flat upon the fore part of the vitreous and crystalline humours, which is like a second iris behind the first, which is extremely vascu- lar, and corresponds with the ciliary circle without. This corpus ciliare is radiated (that is a consequence of the peculiar order and arrangement of its vessels, which run in rays from the ciliary circle, i. e. from the circumference towards the centre.) These radii coming from the ciliary circle are called the ciliary processes; so that the ciliary circle, corpus ciliare, and ciliary processes, are all parts of the same vascu- lar organ. This is the part of the eye to which all those arteries s;o which are next to be described. 1. Two arteries of considerable size go off from the sides of the ophthalmic artery: these go along the sides of the optic nerve; they go towards the ball of the eye; and the one on the outer side of the eye is named external ciliary artery, that on the inner side of the optic nerve is named the internal ciliary, 2. These two divide themselves again into two sub- ordinate branches : one of them as soon as it touches the eye, that is, just beyond the implantation of the optic nerve, enters its substance, and is spread out on its choroid coat in a great number of branches, which are named ciliares breves, the short ciliary arte- ries : the other goes further forward upon the eye before it enters, and even after it enters it still goes forwards to the very fore part of the eye before it divides ; hence named ciliares longas. 3. The anterior ciliary arteries are some small and uncertain branches, which come sometimes Y 4 from

OP THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 362 5. arteria and pectoral muscles; and the most curious branch is a small artery which accompanies the cephalic vein, and runs backwards along the course of the vein, a small and beautiful branch. 4. ARTER1A THORACICA A LARIS. Sometimes, though not always, there is a fourth thoracic artery. When it exists, we find it close by the last artery; its branches, which are sometimes numerous, belong entirely to the cup or hollow of the axilla ; it goes to the glands and fat, and thence -its name of alaris or axillaris. This is the deepest or backmost of these mammary arteries; it attaches itself to the lower border of the scapula, and we often see it running along the lower border a considerable length, and giving branches chiefly to the subscapularis muscle. These are the four mammary arteries which go to the breast. The arteries which go to the scapula follow next, and are only three in number; one, which is the counterpart of the suprascapular artery, is the greatest branch from the axillary artery, supplies the lower surface of the scapula, and thence is named subscapular artery ; one, which, as it is reflected round the joint by the outside, is named the external circumflex artery ; and one, which, as it turns round the inner side of the joint, is named the in- ternal circumflex artery.

OF THE BLOOD.

OF THE HEAT OF THE BLOOD. The next effect of oxygene is said to be the com- municating of heat to the lungs. But I suspect that if the small quantity of oxygene which can enter by the lungs do communicate heat, it must be not to the lungs, nor to the blood, but to the whole body through the medium of the blood- There are some who pretend to say, that when they dra-w in vital air, they feel a genial warmth in the breast, diffusing itself over all the body; but it is easy to feel in this way, or any way, when a favourite doctrine is at stake, while those who know nothing about doctrines breathe the vital air without any peculiar feeling which they can explain. There are many circumstances which make it hard to believe that there is, in consequence of the oxyda- tion of the blood, any remarkable generation of heat in the lungs. Oxydation of the blood, out of the body, is attended with no increase of heat, and yet we operate on a quantity of blood much greater than that which, circulates through the lungs. We call this process not the oxygenation, but the oxydation of the blood, be- cause we are conscious that it is an imperfect process $ it is perfect, indeed, with regard to its ultimate object, viz.thatof communicating oxygene to the whole bodyj but as an assumption of the acidifying principle into the blood itself, we see it to be so imperfect, the union so slight betwixt the oxygene and the blood, that it parts

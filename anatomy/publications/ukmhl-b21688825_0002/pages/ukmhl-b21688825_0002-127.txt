75 OF THE BLOOD. mals, and they never feel the loss, nor decline in health. There is not the smallest doubt that the spleen has pro- truded at wounds, and been strangled, and so cut off. Every day we find it more or less diseased ; sometimes it has swelled to thirty or forty pounds; sometimes it has been reduced to an extremely small s ze ; some- times it has been found like an empty bag. In the foetus, as in a Chick for example, red blood circulates in great profusion long before its lymphatics, spleen, or thymus, can be seen to exist; whereas, on the contrary, since the Chick is insulated, and has no red blood from the mother, the spleen should have been first coloured, and all the red blood of the system should have emanated from the spleen. It is but a poor evasion to say, in answer to these ob- jections, “ some other part may perform this office of the spleen.” What other parts will perform the office of the liver, if it be wanting ? or of the kidney, or of the testicle, or of any other gland ? or will the testicle secrete urine, or the kidney secrete bile ? What gland, then, will be able to perform so peculiar an office as this of adding vesicles or coverings to the central parts of the blood. After all this long dream about the vesicles and their central parts, the best physiologists of the present day seem to deny that they exist. But one author has finished this career of useless ✓ speculation, by maintaining that the life is in the blood: and thus we have seen this simple and beau- tiful subject of the blood tortured through all kinds of imaginations, and running its fiery ordeal, first through mathematics.

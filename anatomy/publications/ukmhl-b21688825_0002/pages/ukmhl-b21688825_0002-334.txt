3*70 OF f'HE EXTERNAL CAROTID, lower coronary artery is usually smaller, and is to be named the branch, while the upper one not only sur- rounds the lip, but mounts along the side of the nose; it is larger ; and is therefore to be considered as the continued trunk. We frequently observe the upper coronary larger on one side of the face, and the lower coronary larger on the other. 4. The lower coronary comes off about an inch or more from the angle of the mouth, at that point where the triangularis oris and many other muscles meet. It goes directly forwards to the angle of The mouth, enters into the lower part of the lip, and runs along the red pulpy part of it, where with the finger and thumb it can be felt beating. It inos- culates with all the arteries formerly mentioned ; as the submental, the twig which comes through the hole near the chin, the inferior labial artery, and with its fellow. With all these it inosculates so freely, that it signifies little from which side your injection is driven: it goes freely all round the lips, and the arteries are every where equally filled. 5. The upper coronary artery we are to con- sider as the continued trunk. The labial artery is still rising, and still tortuous, when it arrives at the angle of the mouth; runs into the border or fleshy part of the upper lip, and runs along it till at the middle of the lip it meets its fellow of the opposite side, with a very free inosculation: yet the two arteries do not terminate here, but usually two very delicate arteries ascend towards the point of the nose, along that little ridge from the nose to the lip which we call the filtrum; and almost always two considerable arteries run

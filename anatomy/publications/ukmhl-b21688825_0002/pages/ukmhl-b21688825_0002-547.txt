475 OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY, perficial all along the middle of the thigh; and when it has advanced two-thirds down the thigh, it again gets too deep to be felt; but all along it is covered by the thick strong fascia of the thigh. Through the whole of this course it gives no one branch out that is of any considerable importance. They are all mus- cular arteries, very small, nearly of one size, nameless, and undistinguished, going into the muscles of the forepart of the thigh; or if any are distinguished, it is only by their relation to other arteries, when the trunk gets low enough to make anastomoses with the arteries of the joint. The nameless muscular branches of the Femoral artery, go, in one word, to all the muscles on the fore* part of the thigh ; to the rectus, sartorius, vasti, gra- cilis, and triceps; to the glands, fascia, fat, and skin; and it thus continues giving successive branches to each of these long muscles as it passes the several points of them. There is no distinguished branch till, having arrived within two handsâ€™ breadth of the knee-joint, it gives out (just where it is about to pass through the tendon of the triceps) a larger branch named (like a similar branch of the humeral artery) ramus anastomoti- CUS MAGNUS. This branch goes out from the inner side of the femoral artery just where it is about to perforate the triceps; it passes into the flesh of the vastus internus; it first sends smaller branches to the vastus internus and sartorius, and through the interstice of these two muscles to the skin of the knee. But having pene- trated into the fleshy belly the vastus internus, this artery.

69 OF THE BLOOD. were six less parts composing the greater globule of the blood. By looking more and more, he pi etended to observe, that these smaller parts into which the red globules broke down still preserved their form ; that these were the particles of the serous part of the blood; and that the great or red particles frequently broke down into serous particles, and these again as frequently united and composed afresh a red globule. He pre- tended to find, that exactly six smaller globules went to make up one great one; and he called the red and serous globules the globules of the first and second order. By this notion of orders it was plain that he intend- ed to plunge deeper into this hypothesis, and to have at least a third and fourth order; besides, these orders and particles were at his call, he might do as he pleased ; and he was almost the only person possessed of glasses which could enable the physiologist to see and tell about them. He pored till he believed, or at least made others believe, that he saw globules of a third order, six times smaller than the serous globules, and of course thirty-six times smaller than the red globules. And thus he had lymphatic particles, six of which made up one serous particle ; and serous particles, six of which made one red globule. To the geometrical physiologists of that day all this instruction concerning the structure of the blood was most delightful; it corresponded very notably with their calculations about regularly descending series of vessels; and a most curious method did they find out for settling this law of the branching of arteries.

485 OF THE LEG AND FOOT. I i 2 hand bones of the tarsus ; it sends one branch across the foot, another forward to the great toe : but the artery itself dives betwixt the first and second metatarsal bone in the middle of the foot, and so gets to the sole, where it ends in inosculations with the back ar- teries There is here something like a posterior recurrent artery; for the tibial artery, before it passes out of the ham, gives a small branch which ascends towards the back part of the joint, and is distributed to the heads of the bones, viz, the tibia and fibula, and to the ori- gin of some of the muscles. ARTERIA RECURRENS, There is here an anterior recurrent, larger than any in the arm, and much resembling the recur- rens interossea. It is a branch which comes off from the forepart of the tibial artery, instantly after it has perforated the interosseous membrane ; it turns imme- diately upwards under the flesh of the tibialis amicus ; it gives many muscular branches, some to the head of the tibialis, others to the upper part of the extensor digitorum, and branches go round thehead of the fibula to the origin of the long peronams muscle. One branch goes directly upwards, and spreads all over the lower part of the knee-joint, mixing its branches in the common vascular net-work. The tibialis antica gives no other branch of irm portance, or which should be named, even from the place of this recurrent quite down to the ankle joint 5 for this, like the radial, or femoral, or any long mus- cular artery, continues giving off branches from eilhetf

9\ QF THE BLOOD, gone; when we mean to preserve their forms for experiment, we must keep them in serum, or must make an artificial serum by impregnating water with salts. Their quantity, in regard to the whole mass, varies so, that the appearance of the blood is a real index of health or disease: in disease and weakness, the blood is poor and colourless; in health and strength, it is rich and florid; by labour, red particles ipay be accumulated in a wonderful degree: in hard working men they abound; they may be accumu- lated by exercise into particular parts, as in the wings ofMoorfowl or Pigeons, and in the legs of common Hens. In short, the red globules are numerous in health ; in large and strong creatures; and in the centre of the system, where they often circulate when (as in fishes) all the flesh is colourless; in such a system, par- ticular glands only, or viscera, as the liver, stomach, or spleen, are coloured with blood, and but a small proportion circulates in the great vessels round thp heart. The redness of these particles is a peculiarity for which we know no meaning nor cause. The greatest physiologists have ascribed it to the iron of the blood; but when we reflect how many various colours iron gives in its various states; when we reflect, that the unknown cause which gives colour to the iron may give colour to the blood; when we reflect that of this crocus of iron we can hardly procure one poor grain from four hundred grains of these red particles of the blood;â€”we cannot but be conscious that this peculi- arity is not yet explained.

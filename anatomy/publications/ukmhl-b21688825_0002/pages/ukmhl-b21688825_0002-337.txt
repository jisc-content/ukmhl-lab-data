OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. 273 and delicate, goes along conducted by the great jugu- lar vein, enters together with it into the skull, and makes one of the arteries of the dura mater, but it is a very delicate twig. In general one artery only of the dura mater is known or mentioned; but here we have seen, besides the great artery of the dura mater, lesser arteries entering to it by all the perforations at the basis of the skull. The pharyngeal actually terminates in the dura mater, passing through the foramen lacerum anterius, and sending also a branch in together with the jugular vein. The occipital artery also sends one with the jugular vein, one by the foramen mastoideum, and one by a small hole in the occiput. The temporal often sends one through by the hole in the back part of the parietal bone. 5. ARTERIA OCCIPITALIS. The occipital artery is also a simple artery, dis- tributing its twigs about the ear, over the occiput, and down the back of the neck, and having no branches of sufficient importance to be particularly marked. It arises next to the pharyngeal from the back part of the carotid; and lying particularly deep, it not only is covered at its root by the other branches of the carotid, but is covered in all its course by the thick muscles of the neck, except just where it is passing round the mastoid process. At first the occipital artery lies close in among the bones, passing over the transverse process of the atlas, crossing the root of the great jugular vein, and passing Vol. If. T under

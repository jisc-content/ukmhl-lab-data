374 OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. have some of them appropriated names. Of these arteries going down towards the back part of the arm, and working their wiy among the muscles, three chiefly are to be observed. First, The arteria profunda su- perior, which goes round the back of the arm to the exterior muscles, and is often namedthe upper muscular artery. Secondly, Another like it, called arteria pro- funda inferior, or the lower muscular artery. Thirdly, The ramus anastomoticus major, which anastomoses round the elbow with the branches of the ulnar artery. These three chiefly deserve notice. I. ARTERIA PROFUNDA HUMERI SUPERIOR. Those arteries, which in the limbs go deep among the fleshy parts, as in the arm or thigh, have always one of two names, either profunda or muscularis, and often both. The upper deep muscular artery of the arm is about the size of a crow-quill, or larger; it goes off from the inner side of the brachial artery, just where the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres are inserted, and very often it arises from the great artery of the scapula, or that of the joint, viz. the sub-scapu- iaris, or reflexa humeri. The profunda turns downwards and backwards round the bone ; it glides in betwixt the first and se- cond head of the triceps ; there it divides within the thick flesh of that muscle into two chief branches, or the two branches sometimes part immediately after their common origin, or sometimes they go off apart from

OF THE MECHANISM 26 seen tlie flesh of the heart, but also to the roots of the great arteries, constituting the vasa vasorum, as such vessels are called. The great coronary vein which collects the blood of these arteries, arises in small branches all over the heart j these meet so as to form a trunk upon the fore-part of the heart, where the septum or union of the ventricles is. While small, the veins accompany their respective arteries ; but after the great trunk is formed, the vein takes its own peculiar route. When the trunk of the great coronary vein (accompanied by several lesser veins) arrives at the auricle, it runs in between the left auricle and left ventricle ; it turns all round the back of the auricle till it gets to the right side of the heart; it lies in the deep groove betwixt the auricle and ventricle, surrounded with much fat; and having almost entirely encircled the heart, it dis- charges its blood into the right auricle, close by the entrance of the lower cava. The opening is very large ; it lies just above the tendinous circle of the auricle, and it is guarded with a strong semilunar valve. This is the great coronary vein : all the veins which appear upon the heart are but branches of it; what are called the middle vein of the heart, the vein of the right auricle, the vena innominata, &c. are all but branches of the great coronary vein running along the right side or lower surface of the heart; if there were to be any marked distinction, it should be into the great co- ronary vein belonging to the left side of the heart, and the vena innominata belonging to the right side. But one thing more is to be observed; viz. that upon the inner surface of the right auricle may be

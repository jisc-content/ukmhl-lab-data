293 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. not cut the carotids, have cut the great arteries of the thyroid gland; the necessity of thinking about the tumours of the gland itself, for I have had the unhappiness to see a person perish by suffocation while consulting physicians forbade any operation; and I had no other than the melancholy privilege of watch- ing, for many hours, the last struggles of a person, who had the day before been walking through all the rooms in tolerable ease and health. Could nothing have been resolved on ? Must we always submit to this? Might not an incision in the fore part (where few arteries are) have at least uncovered the trachea, given a temporary relief, and made the tumour sup- purate more freely ? The extirpation of the tongue, which is mentioned with horror, would be a less ter- rible operation to one acquainted with these arteries ; the extirpation of all tumours under the jaws is dan- gerous; the cutting out completely the parotid gland is a thing quite impossible, since the greatest of all the arteries, viz. the temporal and the maxillary, lie absolutely imbedded in the gland. Yfhat shall we think, then, of those surgeons who talk in such fa- miliar terms of cutting out the parotid gland ? Bleed- ings from the nose have been so often fatal, that Petit is celebrated to this day for a discovery which he never made, viz. the way of plugging the nose so as to stop this bleeding. Have not the French Society been busy renewing inventions for securing even so small an artery as that of the dura mater ? In the hair-lip operation, in cutting cancers, in dissecting tumours from all parts of the face, the surgeon commands the blood only by knowing these arteries. Cowper the U 3 celebrated

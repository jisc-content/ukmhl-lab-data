491 or THE LEG AND FOOT. tendons, and to the inner surface of the aponeurosis plantaris, forming a sort of superficial arch. From these three arteries, much of the skin on the sole of the foot has its branches. The fourth and last branch of the plantaris interna, is one which goes down deep into the centre of the foot j it lies close upon those ligaments which bind together the bones of the tarsus, and under all the tendons, except those of the tibial muscles which are like liga- ments to the bones. Its destination is chiefly to the tarsal joints and caDSules; its inosculations with the ex- ternal plantar artery can be of no importance. PLANTARIS EXTERNA. The external plantar artery is the great artery of the sole of the foot, from which the arches of the foot and the inosculations with the anterior tibial artery are formed. It turns outwards towards the outer edge of the foot j it runs its great circle round by the metatarsal bone of the little toe ; and its plantar arch, or the arch of the sole of the foot, passes over the middle of all the other metatarsal bones. It receives the anterior tibial artery under the middle of the matarsal bone of the great toe. It is this great curve of the artery turning round in the sole of the foot that we name the plantar arch; and it is from it that all the proper arteries of the toes arise, expressly after the same order in which the fingers receive their arteries. The great or external plantar artery lies deep, but not upon the naked bones like the former. It passes through betwixt the heads of the short flexor and massa

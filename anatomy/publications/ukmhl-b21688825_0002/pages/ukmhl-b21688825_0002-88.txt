OB THE ACTION 40 In the very first days in which the heart appears in the chick, while yet its parts are not distinguished, and the punctum saliens is the only name we can give it, the heart, even in this state feels the slightest change pf heat or cold; it is roused by heat, it languishes ■yyhen cold, it is excited when heated again. It is sti- mulated by sharp points or acids,it works under such stimuli with a violent and perturbed motion. In all creatures it survives for a long while the death of the body; for when the creature has died, and the breath- ing and pulse have long ceased, and the body is cold, when the other muscles of the body are rigid, when the stomach has ceased to fee], when the bowels which pre- serve their contractile power the longest have ceased to- roll, and they also feel stimuli no more, still the heart preserves its irritability; it preserves it when torn from, the body and laid out upon the table; heat, caustics, sharp points, excite it to move again. We know also another thing very peculiar concern- ing the irritability of this organ, viz. that it is more irritable on its internal than on its external surface; for if instead of cutting out the heart we leave it con- nected with the body, seek out (as the old anatomists were wont to do) the thoracic duct, or pierce any great vein, and blow a bubble of air into the heart, it pursues it from auricle to ventricle, and from ventri- cle to auricle again, till, wearied and exhausted with this alternate action, it ceases at last, but still new sti- i muli will renew its force. Thus it is long after apparent drowning or.other suffocation before the principle of life is gone; and, )c„ng after the death of the body before the heart be dead ^

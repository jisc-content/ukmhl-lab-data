108 OF THE BLOOD, that it acquires them by absorbing the basis of pure air; for pure air is nothing but this presumed basis dilated into the form of a;r by heat; and when it combines with any body, it gives out its heat; so that in ail these processes heat is produced. And although inflammable bodies, metals, acids, and animal blood, seem very distinct from each other; although com- bustion, breathing, calcination, and the forming of acids, are processes seemingly very unlike; yet they are in all their essential points the same, viz. a change of qualities and a production of heat in consequence of the absorption of pure air. First, when an inflammab le body is burnt or con- sumed by fire, the basis of pure air is combining with the combustible body; the air is entering into a new combination, and therefore must give out its heat; it combines rapidly, gives out its heat rapidly, is wasted; the inflammable body burrs and seems to be con- sumed: but if w e catch that air which escapes from the inflammable bodv, we find it to be equai exactly to the whole weight of the air and of the burning body that have been consumed; and this air consists of two parts, viz of the substance which was burnt, and of the basis of pure air. Thus, for example when we burn charcoal or carbon, the whole sub- stance of it, weight for weight, is converted into an air, which is called fixed or fixable air; the same which is discharged from stoves, the same also which is found in pits, the same which oozes through the ground in the Grotto del Cane, the same which floats upon the surface of fermenting vats, and which is so much heavier than common air that it can be taken o\}X

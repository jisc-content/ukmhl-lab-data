51 OF THE PERICARDIUM* E 2 in contact, the diaphragm only intervening; thence the lower cava which passes from the liver into the right auricle of the heart cannot have any length. 'While the pericardium thus passes round the great vessels, it must leave tucks and corners ; and these have been named the cornua or horns of the pericardium. But there is another peculiarity in the form of the pericardium, which I have explained in this second plan*; viz. that the pericardium constitutes also the immediate coat of the heart; for the pericardium having gone up beyond the basis of the heart so as to surround the great vessels, it descends again along the same vessels, and from tlie vessel goes over the heart itself. I have marked the manner of this more delicate inflection of the pericardium at (aa)—where the peri- cardium is loose; at (bbJ,—-the angle where it is re- flected; and at (cc),—where it forms the outer coat of the heart. The pericardium where it forms this outer coat becomes extremely thin and delicate, almost cuticular, but strong: under this coat there is much cellular substance ; the coronary arteries pass along in this cellular substance, the muscular fibres are bound together by it, and under it the fat is gathered some- times in a wonderful degree, so as to leave very little to be seen of the dark or muscular colour of the heart. The pericardium then is a dense and very strong membrane, which I would compare with the capsule of any great joint, both in office and inform: for it is rough and cellular without, shining and tendinous within; bedewed with a sort of halitus like the great joints, delicate and almost a cobweb-like membrane * N°.

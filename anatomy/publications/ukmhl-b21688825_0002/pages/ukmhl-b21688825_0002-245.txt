THE FOETUS. 381 auricles touch each other only behind; at their fore part they are separated by the roots of the aorta and pulmonic artery, as may be seen in any of the plans. We look, then, for the foramen ovale at the very backmost part of the right auricle; or rather it is placed so high in the auricle as 10 seem to belong rather to the root of the cava descendens.—A ring rises round the borders of the hole, very pro- minent, and exactly like the ring of the meatus auditorius internus in a child.—This was named isthmus viussenh; but this conceited name of isthmus, which Veussens gave it, is quite unintelligible, and it must be changed for that of the circllus for am i n is oval is, the ring or circle of the oval hole.—This circle is thick at its edges ; very strongly muscular, like the musculi pectinati of the auricle ; in so much that authors of some character have thought this a sphincter for the oval hole. There is no doubt a kind of decussation xaf the fibres at each end of the oval hole ; so that these fibres, forming a sort of pillar on each side or edge of the foramen, the name of Pil- lars of the Ring, or columns foraminis ovalis, is less exceptionable; though these pillars, or any thing deserving such a name, will not be easily found by one beginning anatomy^ The valve of the oval hole Ijes entirely on the left side, as the round edges of the right side may demon- strate. By taking the blunt probe, we find we can lift it towards the left side ; but being pushed towards t; ,e right side, it rises into a sort of bag, and opposes‘the probe. The valve is perfectly transparent; it seems delicate, like all the other membranous valves, but is N 8 really

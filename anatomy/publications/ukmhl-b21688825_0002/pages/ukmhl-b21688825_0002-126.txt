74 OP THE LL00D, probably in that condition pass intotheblood. But if the foetus requires a great supply of bicod, and the thymus assists the lymphatic glands, how conies it, when both lymphatic glands and thymus are working'in concert to prepare a great quantity of- blood, that the spleen, â– which is to finish all the^e particles, and to make vesicles for them, is not in a child as big as its liver is ? That red globules are found in the lymphatics, and most especially in the lymphatics of the spleen, is a most ordinary occurrence, and quite intelligible. There are not found any where, not even in the spleen, imperfect globules advancing in their organization ; on the contrary, those which we do find are full formed globules which have been forced out of the common line of the circulation ; they are extravasated, and taken up by the absorbents before death; or they are squeezed into them by handling after death. If we want to have an example of the first, we have but to inflame a part and tie up its lymphatics, and then many red par- ticles are found in them ; the second we see every time we eilher look for, or prepare the lymphatics of the spleen, or of any other soft viscus ; for by handling and squeezing, the blood passes through the small breaches occasioned by this violence into the lympha- tics ; if we allow the part to spoil, then air is generated, and, by handling it, air passes into the lymphatics in the same way. But the spleen is essential to finish the work ; it makes the vesicles, and lias ceils for the business; and yet this part, which has the most important of all offices, viz. that of organizing the general mass of blood, is every day cut out from Dogs and other ani- mals,

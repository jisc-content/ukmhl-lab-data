ARTERIES OF THE EYE. 334 the upper and one to the lower eyelid; and often the two arise by one trunk. Arteria palpebralis inferior.*— The artery of the lower eyelid is the branch of the two which goes off the first; but it is the smaller and less regu- lar of the two. Its twigs go one to the union of the two tarsal cartilages, to the caruncula lachrymalis, and to the adjoining part of the adnata ; another goes deeper, viz. to the lachrymal sac, and even into the aethmoid cells; and a third twig runs along the margin of the tarsus, named tarsal artery, supplying the Maibomian glands. Arteria palpebralis superior.— The artery of the upper eyelid arises along with the lower palpebral or near it; it gives few branches ; one keeps to the angle of the eye, and supplies the orbi- cularis oculi, the caruncula, and the tunica con- junctiva ; another having pierced the fibres of the oblique'muscle, runs along the borders of the tarsus inosculating with a similar branch of the lachrymal artery, and forming an arch along the upper tarsus as the other does below. 3. ARTERIA NASALIS. The nasal artery goes off at the edge of the orbit, rises over the lachrimal sac, and over the liga- ment of the eyelids; it first gives a twig upwards to the root of the frontal muscle; then another goes down over the lachrymal sac, and after giving branches to the sac, goes to the orbicularis muscle, and inoscu- lates wjth the infra-orbitary artery j and lastly, the most

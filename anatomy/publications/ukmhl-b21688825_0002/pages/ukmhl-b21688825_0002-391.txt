325 ARTERIES OF THE EYr that it stands quite open and gaping when the nerve is cut across; and was long known to the older anatomists by the name of porus opticus, before the meaning of this orifice or hole was understood. When this artery arrives within the eye, it branches out most beautifully upon the retina. The angles and meshes which this artery makes give the name of retina or net-like to the whole; for the pulpy part of the optic nerve expands into a very thin and delicate web which resembles mucus. This web has all its strength from these branches of the central artery. The branches of the artery, and the mucus-like ex- pansion of the nerve, lie in two separate layers ; and hence some anatomists reckon the retina a double membrane. The arteria centralis having given off sidewise these innumerable branches to the retina, still goes forwards, plunges through the substance of the vitreous .humour, does not stop till it arrives at the back part of the lens, and is of course the arteria centralis oculi, the central artery of the eye itself. This central artery can no more be seen in the adult eye than the arte- ries of an unprepared bone; but by injecting the small arteries of the eye of a foetus, of a slink Calf, or of any young animal, the arteria centralis oculi is found to distribute its branches in the following way ; As it goes forwards through the centre of the eye. ball, it gives oft' its delicate arteries from side to side, which go along the partitions of the vitreous humour (for the vitreous humour is divided every where by membranes into small honeycomb-like cells.)

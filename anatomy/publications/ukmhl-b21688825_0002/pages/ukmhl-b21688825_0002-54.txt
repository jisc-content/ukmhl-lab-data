] 2 OF THE MECHANISM upper part of the chest, and lies over the carotid arteries. The lower vena cava, or cava Ascr-NDENS, brings in like manner all the blood from the belly and lower parts of the body by two great branches. One, mark- ed (c),—is the great vein which lies in the belly along the left side of the spine, and brings the blood from the legs, the pelvis, and parts of generation, the kid- neys, &cy it is named the vena cava abdominalis, because of its lying in the abdomen. Another, marked (ddd),—arises in three or four great branches from the liver ; it is named the branches of the vena cava in the liver, or the vena cava hepatic a ; and these two make up the lower cava ; and the lower and the upper cavas now join themselves at —to form the right sinus of the heart. 2. The right sinus or the heart marked (<?), is of considerable extent; it is just the gradual dilatation of the two veins forming the auricle or reservoir, which is incessantly to supply the heart; the veins grow stronger as they approach the sinus, and the sinus still stronger as it approaches the auricle or notched and pendulous part (/), and the auricle again approaches in its nature to the ventricle of the heart; for it is crossed with very strong muscular fibres, which make very deep risings and furrows upon its inner part. To say that these veins, or the sinus which they form, are not muscular, merely because, they are not red nor fleshy, is very ignorant; for t e ureters, urethra, ar- teries, intestines, the iris, and many other parts of the human body, are, at the same time, perfectly muscular and perfectly pale; and the heart of a fish is as trans- parent as a bubble of water, and yet is so irritable, that

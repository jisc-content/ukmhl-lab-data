268 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID. twigs upon the arch o£ the palate, upon the velum palati and upon the uvula : it usually has two small branches for supplying these parts, one superficial and one deep; and thus the labial gives a particular artery to the palate, name arteria palatina inferior. 2. It gives a particular artery to the tonsil, which arises at the point where the stylo-glossus begins to mix with the other muscles of the tongue. This little artery penetrates the walls of the pharynx upon which it lies, and spreads its many twigs upon the tonsil and tongue. 3. While passing through the submaxillary gland, dividing it as it were, into two parts, the labial artery gives a great many small twigs into the substance of the gland itself; and after these it gives many twigs to the tongue, the skin, the muscles, &c. Of these, two chiefly are remarkable; one, which goes to the pterygoid muscle chiefly, though it also gives branches to the constrictors of the fauces and palate, and to the root of the tongue; and another artery, more con- stant and regular, which breaks off at the place where the labial artery curls and bends to turn upwards: it runs superficially, and goes straight forwards to the root of the chin, where it is named arteria submen- talis : it turns upwards over the chin to the face at the middle of the chin, and often inosculates with some of the arteries of the face : it sometimes comes from the sublingual artery. But the artery having emerged from betwixt‘the lobes of the submaxilly gland (for this artery in a manner divides it into lobes), and from among the fat with which it is surrounded, makes a sudden turn over

But if Leeuwenhoek knew this as well as Dr. Martin, I cannot for my heart think it any wonder that Leeuwenhoek chose “ the most convenient and firmest way of constructing a red glo- bule, viz,, out of six smaller ones.” Seeing that he had the affair entirely in his own hands, “ what a beau- tiful harmony and regularity do we perceive, says Martin, in t'he mass of blood? Magnum certe opus oculis video.” In plain truth, they desired but a little of this harmony, a little consistency in their doctrine, and all was well. But the mistakes concerning the formation or or- ganizing of this blood are worse than these ; for they came from men truly learned, and diligent in ana- tomy, led on by too strong a desire of finding out the uses of several parts of the human body, as of the Spleen and Thymus, parts hitherto unexplained. Mr. Hewson supposed that the lymphatic glands, which seem at first to be mere convoluted vessels, but which microscopes shew as consisting of numerous cells, form in these cells the primordia of the red blood ; for each red particle he supposes to consist of a central particle, which is solid and dark-coloured, surrounded by a vesicle which is transparent or white; and this dark or central part he supposes is formed in the lymphatic cells ; for he finds a sort of round particles in the lymph, and often he finds the lymphatics full of red blood. Next, he has supposed that in the child there is re- quired a much greater supply of blood j for this pur- pose

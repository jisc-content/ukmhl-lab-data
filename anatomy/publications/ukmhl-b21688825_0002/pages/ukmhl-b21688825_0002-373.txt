OF THE BRAIN. 30*? to tlie fore lobe, another to the middle lobe, and a third to form the circle of Willis. These arteries are usually so numbered that the communicating branch is first described, next the anterior artery of the brain, and lastly the middle artery of the brain. But of this arrangement no one who is accustomed to ob- serve the course of this artery can entirely approve ; for when the carotid rises from the side of the sella turcica, it divides into its three branches all at once, in a tripod- like form : the middle branch of the tripod is largest - the next, which goes forwards to the fore lobe of the brain, is smaller ; the third, which is the communica- ting branch, going backwards to unite with the verte- bral artery and form the circle of Willis, is the smallest of all. The middle artery of the brain then is, from its great size, to be regarded as the trunk. 1. ARTERIA MEDIA CEREBRI. The middle lobe of the brain is separated from the anterior lobe by a very deep sulcus or furrow, which is named fissura sylvii. This fissura Sylvii is formed by the transverse process of the sphenoid bone, or, in other words, by that very sharp line which runs out laterally from each of the clinoid processes, and which parts the fore lobe, which lies in the shallow part of the skull upon the orbitary processes of the frontal bone, from the middle lobe, which is the largest of all, and lies in the deepest part of the skull behind the clynoid processes. The middle artery of the brain having risen from the side of the sella turÂ° eica, runs straight along this fossa Sylvii, and is really X 2 thg

89 OF THE BLOOD. animals the strangest reverses. The Skate has red globules much larger, and the ox has globules much smaller, than those of a man Fish have large globules, serpents smaller ones, and Man smaller still. In Man the diameter of each globule is much less than the three thousandth part of an inch. There is in the effect of lenses, or in the nature of these globules, some strange refraction, by which there seems a darkness in the centre of each globule, and thence a deception which has been universal; so that no single description has tallied with that which went before. Leeuwenhoek believed that he saw them con- sisting each of six well compacted smaller globules: Hewson believed that they were bladders, which had within them some central body, loose and moveable; that often the central part might be seen rolling in its bag; and that sometimes the bladder was shrunk ancl shrivelled around the central body, and could, by put- ting a drop of water upon it, be plumped up again. The Abbe Torre examined them with simple lenses too; but they magnified so highly, that from this cause all his noisy mistake has arisen; for he used not ground lenses, but small sphericles of glass formed by dropping melted glass into water: they magnified so much, that to him the central spot appeared much darker; he said that these were not globules, but rings. He sent his sphericles of glass and his observations from Italy, his own country, to our Royal Society; and for along while, though nobody could see them, still the pub- lic were annoyed by Abbe Torre’s rings. Falconer, with all the zeal of a friend, published Hewson’s disco- veries after he was dead; lamenting, as we all must do.

OF THE ACTION 42 head and brain, the destruction of its nerves, or its total separation from that living system to which it belongs ? if the heart be the most irritable muscle of the body, if all this irritability arise from the nerves, how can it be that this muscle, which is thus announ- ced as the most dependent on its nerves, is really the most independent? that the muscle which of all the body needs this nervous supply oftenest should want it the least, and should survive the loss of its nerves so much longer than the other muscles of the same body ? Although the ancients knew how irritable the heart was, although they often opened living creatures, and saw the heart struggling to relieve itself, because it was oppressed with blood, yet they continued entirely ignorant of the cause: and why the heart should al- ternately contract and relax without stop or interrup- tion, seemed to them the most inexplicable thing in nature. Hippocrates ascribed it to the innate fire that is in the heart; Sylvius said, that the old and alkaline blood in the heart mixing with the new and acid chyle, and with the pancreatic lymph, produced a ferment there; Swammerdam, Pitcairn, and Freind, thought that the heart, and every muscle which had no antagonist muscle, was moved by a less pro- portion of the vital spirit than other muscles required. C hers believed that each contraction of a muscle com- pressed the nerves of that muscle, and each relaxation relieved it; and that this alternate compression and relief of the nerve was the cause of the alternate move- ments of the heart: another physician of our own country, a great mechanic and a profound scholar in mathematics.

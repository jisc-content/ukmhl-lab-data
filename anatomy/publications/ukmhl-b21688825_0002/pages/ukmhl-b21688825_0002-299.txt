THE HEART. 2 35 its way through the ribs, destroys the vertebrae, affects the spinal marrow; and thus the patient dies a less violent or sudden death. Most frequently, the tumour rises towards the root of the neck, is felt beating there, destroys the sternum, bursts up the ribs, dislocates and throws aside the clavicles, appears at last in the form of a great tumour upon the breast, beating jiwfully.â€”A dreadful state! and with nothing to keep in the blood but a thin covering of livid skin, which grows continually thinner, till, bursting at last, the patient expires in one gush of blood.

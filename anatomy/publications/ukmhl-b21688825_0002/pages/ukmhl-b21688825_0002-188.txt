136 OF RESPIRATION. wounds in the human body, the diaphragm, ches£, every thing which contributes to breathing, is so closely contracted, and the pressure is so great, that the lungs are actually compressed and protruded: so that his seeing, as he says, the lungs dilated, that is, squeezed out, when the thorax contracted, is like the ignorance of a child looking from a carriage-window, who believes and wonders at the trees and houses running backwards. But as no experiment-maker ever allows his experiments to remain incomplete, Mr. Bremond finishes his by the following daring assertion, “ that always when he made his incision no more than three inches long, the lungs dilated themselves with so much violence that they drove out the air before them, protruded themselves through the opening, and made the blood jerk out at ail points*.” In short, he repeats this mistake in every possible form, viz. that the motions of the lungs and thorax are directly opposite to each other ; that the lungs are contracting while the thorax dilates, and the thorax contracting again when the lungs dilate. When I open a Frog, it fills its lungs with perfect ease after both its breast and belly have been entirely cut away. <c If admitting air into the thorax could really make the lungs collapse, why do not those of the Frog col- lapse?'5 This is such gross ignorance as should not have been endured in pne reading papers before the * If one word of this were true, what would become of those who had adhesions of the lungs? Surely if the lungs and thorax moved in opposite directions, the one contracting while the other dilated, the force of the lungs never could pull down the thorax.-— Such patients must die. % KoyaJ[

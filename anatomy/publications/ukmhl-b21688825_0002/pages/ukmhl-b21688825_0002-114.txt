62 OF THE HEART. that they had never believed them themselves** w The chyme,” says Bartholine, ec and the thinner blood* passes through the septum of the heart, when the heart is in systole and the pores and passages are en- larged.” Thus did the celebrated Bartholine believe the septum perforated. Wallaeus, and Marchetti, and Mollinettus, and Monichen, believed it, and Mr. Broad- becquius of Tubingen proved it \* But I believe most potently with Haller, that whenever they wanted to show those perforations, they managed their probes so as to make passages as wide and as frequent as the oc- casion required : tc Solebant foramina parare adigendo stylos argenteos in resistens septum,” says Haller; and this is a full and true account of all the authors who have described side passages through the septum of the heart: they needed them, and they made them. Amidst all this ignorance, we cannot wonder that a thousand childish imaginations prevailed, nor that the qualities of the mind were deduced from the phy- sical properties of the heart. We have heard the vul- gar, for example, speak of the bone of the heart. And from whom did this arise ? From Aristotle ! who ex- plains to us, that there is at the root of the heart a bone which serves for its basis ; and not a physician has written upon the heart since his time, who has not spoken more or less mysteriously about this bone : * That I may not seem to speak too harshly of this knot of conspirators against Harvey, I will quote what Boerhaave says of Riolanus, who was at the head of them : “ Non ipse callidus cavillationum artifex Riolanus,” Sic. f Experiment perforatum ostendit Broadbeequius Tubingae. while

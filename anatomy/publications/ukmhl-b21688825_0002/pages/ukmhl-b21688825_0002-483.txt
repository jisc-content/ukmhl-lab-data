STOMACH, LIVER, AND SPLEEN. 415 dextra, though properly it is not a branch, but the continued trunk of the gastric artery. As the first branch turns round behind the oesophagus, this stops and turns to the lesser arch of the stomach, touches it just at the cardiac orifice, i. e. at the root of the oesophagus ; turns with a gentle turn round the lesser arch of the stomach, bending as the arch bends, giving its branches down both forwards and back- ward! over each side of the stomach. As it runs along the stomach it is sensibly exhausted by these arteries, so that it arrives very small at the lower or pyloric orifice of the stomach; there it turns over from the stomach upon the small gut in such a way as to belong to the pylorus or union of the gut with the stomach ; and though small and trivial, it has an appropriated name, arteria pylorica superior, and thus the gastric artery ends. But sometimes, ashas been mentioned in the general description, the gastric artery sends a branch to the liver; yet, in that case, the order of these arteries already enumerated, is in no degree disturbed; the artery running along the oesophagus, the artery running round the cardia and in form of a crown, the artery returning along the lesser arch, are still the same; only, after giving off this last artery, the trunk of the gastric goes off from the stomach, continues its course towards the liver, and passes into it. 2. arteria hepatica. The hepatic artery goes off from the cceliac axis, where it almost touches the point of the spige- lian

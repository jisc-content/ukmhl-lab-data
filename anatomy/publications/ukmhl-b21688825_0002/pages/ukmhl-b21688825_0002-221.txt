OF RESPIRATION, I 6$ Often when the insect lives in water, it has only two puncta respiratoria: these puncta begin either in the snout or in the tail; they are the openings of two great air-tubes which run down each side of the in- sect like two aortas, and the insect has means of rising to the surface, takes down a bubble of air along with it, and discharges a bubble of air before it rises again : of this nature are the air tubes of that Worm from which the Ephemeris proceeds. The sketch of the Ephe- meris and its air-tubes is given in figure 7.â€”This Fly lias but two spiracula; they are so small towards the neck, where their commencement is, that their mouths cannot be easily found. The two great air-tubes [a a) are seen like two aortas running all along the body, and their minuter branches (b b) are seen ra- mifying beautifully upon the abdominal muscles and other parts. Many insects are aquatic when first they are hatched from the egg. They have little gills which serve them while they continue in the water, as, for example, the Ephemeris Fly; but along with these gills they have the ordinary structure of air-tubes, and the day on which they emerge from the water, the gills shrink, and the air-tubes begin their function; and these changes succeed each other very rapidly in all insects, but most especially in the Ephemeris, which is destined to live but one day. It is most of all singular, that in some insects the number of respiratory points, or puncta, changes ac- cording to the various condidons or stages of their existence. For example, a Worm which crawls among the dust, since it must breathe less easily, has more puncta than when it has changed its state to that of M 2 a Fly

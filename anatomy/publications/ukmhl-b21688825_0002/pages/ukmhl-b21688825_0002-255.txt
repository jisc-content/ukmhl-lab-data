THE FOETUS. 191 u It must seem very strange for me, after saying that inflating the lungs restores an animal after appa- rent death, and recovers the drowned, to afllrm that long continued respiration is fatal*; and yet we need not look long for the cause of this; for during this long continued inspiration, much blood must be gathered in the lungs, but none can get outf.” Nothing is attributed, in his explanation, to the want of air, but all is attributed to the obstruction of the blood: yet if this were all, Amphibia woud need no lungs, fishes would need no gills, insects could need no air-tubes; for none of these assist the motions of the heart.- Monro, who puts Haller to rights in every thing else, follows him in this. “ In all amphi- bious animals, therefore,” says Monro, <e every part of the body may receive a considerable portion of blood, although the respiration and free passage of the blood through their lungs be interrupted,” &c. (p. 21.) And the celebratell Blumenbach, the man * “ Paradoxum videri possit, ab inspiratione sanguinis in pulmo- ncm commeatum expediri: inflato etiam aere, quod genus est magnse inspirationis, animalia moribunda reviviscere, et sanguinis per pul- mones iter revocari: et tamen hanc eandem, adeo faventem sanguinis per pulmonem motui inspirationem, sola pauio diuturniori continua- tione, anxietatem primo incredibilem facere, deinde, si vel voluntatis violento imperio tamen aer in pulmone retineatur, vel ab alia causa intra pulmonem copiosior servetur, denique sanissimum et fortissimum hominem subito interire.” f “ Hujus nunc anxietatis et suffocationis, et denique mortis causam non est arduum invenire. Adparet enim, ab inspiratione diutius continuata, sanguinem in pulmonem quidem advenire, et <Songeri, exitum vero ex pulmone non in venire. most

572 or THE AXILLARY ARTERY. ' the stroke of a blockhead’s needle in the following case, 1 am at a loss to conceive. A Woman came to me with a great string hanging in her axilla, and along with her came her surgeon. He had about three months before cut off her breast for a cancer, and moreover some glands from the axilla, from which there was a bleeding; and of course, as his fingers could not go deep enough, he took a needle propor- tionably large, struck it down into the arm-pit, and tied all up. When he brought his patient to me, there hung from the arm-pit, not a surgical ligature, but a good large tape; the axilla was a large gaping and terribly fetid ulcer; I passed my finger into it, and felt the arteries beating around it, and the tape firm about some cord of nerves, whether one or more I could not tell; the Woman’s lingers were as crooked as a bird’s talon, and her arm hung by her side quite useless and lame. I made the surgeon feel the nerve with his fin- ger, and offered to cut out the ligature safely; but he carried away his patient, that he might, though at a long interval, finish the operation himself. The breast had been long healed, and the cord acted as an issue in the axilla. How near the edges of this needle must have been to the great artery, it is terri- ble to think; and it is most providential that such ac- cidents do not happen daily, considering how much this crooked needle is used in deep places, where it is least fit to be used.

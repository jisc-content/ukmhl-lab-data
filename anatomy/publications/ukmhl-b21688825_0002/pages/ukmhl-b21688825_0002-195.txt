OF RESPIRATION. 145 may fly, and in forcing the air through the true lungs. Fourthly, There is in the place of a divided abdomen and thorax, with long abdominal muscles, no proper abdomen, a long thorax, a high sternum, and very elastic ribs, extending along the whole body till they almost meet the pelvis, making the abdominal muscles very short; and the air-cells all along adhere to the inner surface of these bones. With these points clearly before us, we cannot mis- take the mode of respiration in birds. The thorax does the whole ; the thorax is raised, and immediately the cells are expanded, by which two functions are performed; for the air which comes into the cells, passing through the lungs, oxydates the blood, and the cells become full at the same time so as to make the body lighter. The thorax is depressed again, and the air, which passes now a second time through the lungs, may a second time oxydate the blood, for it is not thoroughly spoiled; and what is spoiled is duuted with the air of many cells, which respiration cannot empty at one stroke. The final cause also is plain. Had the lungs in a fowl been solid and fleshy as they arein fowls, (or even in any other creature,) and at the same time sufficiently large to perform, without the help of those air bags, all the functions of lungs, they must have been large and heavy in proportion to the body of the fowl; they must have occupied much room, and added much to the weight. But the lungs of a fowl are very dense, very small in proportion to its system, very full of blood, quite fixed, and undilatable; the rapid course of the air through them backwards and forwards ena = hling them in their business of oxygenation to do much with

The whole heart lies out flat upon the diaphragm; it's basis (c)-—where the auricles are, is turned towards the spine and towards the right side ; the apex (d)—or acute point, is turned forwards, and a little obliquely towards the left side, where it strikes the ribs ; the vena Cava (^)—enters in such a manner through a tendinous ring of the dia- phragm *, that it ties down the right auricle to that floor (as I may term it) of the thorax ; the aorta (/) does not rise in that towering fashion in which it is seen when we take a dried-up heart, which naturally we hold by its apex, instead of layirlg it out flat upon the palm of our hand; nor in that perpendicular direction in which hitherto, for the sake of distinctness, I have represented it in these plans ; but the aorta goes out from its ventricle towards the right side of the thorax ; it then turns in form of an arch, not directly upwards, but rather backwards towards the spine ; then it makes a third twist to turn downwards ; where it turns downwards it hooks round the pulmonic ar- tery (g),—just as we hook the fore-fingers of our two hands within one another; The right heart (hh)— stands so before the other, that we see chiefly the right hitherto represented it in all my plans, while 17. represents its inclined position lying almost horizontally upon the floor of the diaphragm; ^ Let it be observed, that (e) in this drawing marks the point where the lower cava was tied close upon the diaphragm, to pre- vent the injection going down into tire liver. auricle

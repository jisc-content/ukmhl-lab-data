ns CIRCULATION OF easily explained ; and the part first mentioned, viz. the ductus venosus, is the part the most difficult to be un- derstood, and never without the help of a plan. In my plan 1 have endeavoured to elucidate these points. First, The mere anatomy, connections, and inoscu- lations of the vessels ; showing how the umbilic. 1 vein brings in the blood of the mother; h >w that vein spreads in the liver and feeds all its left side with blood ; and how the ductus venosus carries part of that blood away from the circu.ation of the li er, conducting it directly onwards to the right side of the heart. Secondly, I have endeavoured to explain what parts of the liver each branch supplies, and how these vessels lie in the liver of a new-born child. Thirdly, I have contrasted with this the change of form in these same vessels, when, as Happens in the adult, the form.of the liver s changed, and the ductus venosus and the umbilical vein are obliterated, and gone or converted into ligaments of very trivial use or size. The blood from the maternal system transmitted through the placenta, and oxydated, or having un- dergone some change equivalent to oxydation, comes down along the umbilical vein;â€”the vein enters by the navel, adheres to the inner surface of the abdo- men, enters into the liver at the top of that great transverse cleft which divides the liver into two lobes; and after entering the liver, it begins, as if it were the regular

32 OF THE MECHANISM the neat small slip of white arid very delicate membrane* the one end of which connects itself with the fore-part of the Eustachian valve ; so that both valves are moved and made tense at once. The Eustachian valve is in general thick and fleshy; it is sometimes reticulated or net-like even in the foetus, but by no means'"'so often as to vin- dicate Winslow, in adding reticulare to the name; it grows reticulated chiefly in the adult. The only beautiful drawing that we have of a reticular Eustachian vaive is in Cuwper; and that was from a man of eighty years of age. Perhaps in eight or ten hearts you will not find one that is reticulated in the least degree; in old men it is reticulated, just as all the other valves of the heart are, not by any thing peculiar to the constitution of this valve ; not by the pressure of the blood and continual force of the vessels, as Haller represents ; but by the gradual absorption which goes on in old age, and which spates not the very bones, for even they grow thin and in many places transparent. This is the simple description of a valve, which has been the occasion of more controversy than the cir- culation of the foetus and the use of the oval hole. Winslow first began about eighty years ago to observe the connections and uses of this valve: he laid it down as an absolute fact that this valve was almost peculiar to the foetus ; that it was perfect only while the fora- men ovale was open ; that it vanished gradually as the foramen ovale closed; that in the adult it was sel- dom seen unless the foramen ovale was also open by chance. It is incredible what numbers of anatomists followed this opinion; for the difficulty of dissecdng

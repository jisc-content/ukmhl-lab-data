OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 361 branches as this is; it is sufficient to say, that aftey giving small twigs to the axillary glands, it terminates with all its larger branches in the pectoral muscle, mamma, and skin, and in inosculations with the intercostals and internal mammary ; it is very long, descending sometimes so low as to give branches to the oblique muscles of the belly. 3. ARTERIA THORACICA HUMERARIA. The thoracic artery of the shoulder goes off from the upper and fore part of the. axillary artery. Its place is exactly opposite to that of the mammaria superior, viz. under the point of the coracoid process, insomuch that Haller has named it thoracica acro- mialis. It is a short, thick artery; it bursts through the interstice between the pectoral and deltoid muscles, and appears upon the shoulder almost as soon as it comes off from the main artery; it resembles the thyroid in shape, being a short thick artery, termi- nating all at once in a lash of slender branches, which go over the shoulder in various directions: but I never could observe any order worth describing. One deeper branch goes to the serratus major, a branch goes along the clavicle, gives it the nutritious artery, and then goes on to the pectoral muscle, and to the skin of the breast: it gives small branches to the axil- lary glands, and larger ones to the deltoid and pec- toral muscles and skin of the shoulder, for this is very much a cutaneous artery. The chief branch is that which is last named, running down betwixt the deltoid and

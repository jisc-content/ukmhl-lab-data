138 OF RESPIRATION. would be formed, but that instantly the lungs follow it and prevent a vacuum ; for the lungs are free in the thorax, the air has free access to go down into the ve- sicles of the lungs; and so when the diaphragm retires, the lungs follow it, being dilated by the pressure of the air which enters by the trachea. But this protrusion of the belly excites the abdo- minal muscles to react; their pressure restores the diaphragm to its natural form; when pressed back again by the abdominal viscera, it rises in the thorax, becomes again convex towards the lungs, the thorax is reduced in size, the lungs are compressed, and that air is driven out again which they had just received. The thorax also moves in concert with the diaphragm: and this motion is most curiously arranged; for, first, the intercostal muscles lift the thorax for respi- ration, in the very moment in which the diaphragm is pressing down, and consequently at the instant wrhen the abdominal muscles, which are attached to the lower borders of the thorax, are relaxed, so that they suffer it to rise. Next, the thorax is to be compres- sed and pulled down by the abdominal muscles; and this happens at the very instant in which the abdo- minal muscles react against the diaphragm; so that the abdominal muscles, while they thrust back the diaphragm, pull the lower edges of the thorax down with great power. Thus in Man, and almost all animals, the respira- tion is performed by a diaphragm. SECOND

Â®F THE ARTERIES 44$ the ischium, gives off many small branches to the blad- der, prostate gland, vesiculx seminales, and rectum. But when it has reached the perinxum, and is about to emerge from the pelvis a second time, and go into the root of the penis, it gives out three chief arteries ; one to the perinxum, one to the body of the penis, one to the back of the penis thus: When the artery has approached nearly to the musculus transversalis perinxi, it splits into two branches; one of which is the artery of the perinxum, the other is the proper artery of the penis. ARTERIA PERINiEI. The artery of the perineum passes under the transversalis perinxi, and betwixt the accelerator and erector penis; in short, it comes out from that triangular cavity which we cut into in lithotomy; in which opera- tion ofcoursethisbranch cannot escape. The artery hav- ing escaped from this triangular cavity, runs forwards along the perinxum for two or three inches, according to the size of the subject, growing very sensibly smaller as it goes along. It is chiefly forsupplying the skin and muscles of the perinxum ; and gives these branches : 1. When it has just come out from the triangular hol- low, it gives off from its root one branch at right angles, which goes directly across the perinxum it x keeps the course of the transverse muscle; it may be named aRteria transversalis perinxi, and ends., about the sphincter ani. 2. It gives branches to the accelerator and erector muscles. 3. It gives branches to the scrotum ; and being continued along the corpus cavernosum of each side, it ends upon the tendinous sheath.

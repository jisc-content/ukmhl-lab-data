MALCON FORMATION OF 20S in every direction. This was the pericardium cover- ing a heart of enormous size, filling the thorax, and reaching almost to the first rib ; very little of the right lobe of the lungs, and none almost of the left, was to be seen; the yeins in the upper part of the thorax, viz. the subclavian and jugulars, were choaked by the pressure, and much distended ; the heart itself was full of blood, and the coronary veins so turgid, that it re- sembled a most minute and beautiful injection of the heart.

ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. 337 confusion in the reader’s mind; and regarding chiefly those little arteries which belong to the membranes of the brain. It is of great importance in studying the brain, to know the manner in which its membranes • are con- nected with it; and it is especially to be remarked that the internal surfaces, or, in other words, the cavities of the brain, need to be supported, nourished, and supplied with blood as much as the external sur- face ; and that for this end the pia mater turns inwards and lines all the cavities of the brain. At different points the pia mater and its arteries take various forms, and are called rete mirabile, velum, or choroid plexus, according to that form. The rete mirabile has already been explained, as being that division and reunion of the branches of the carotid artery by which the force of the ascending blood is broken before it enters the brain. In many of the lower animals this provision of Nature is most curious and particular; but in Man it would appear, that the erect posture in which he walks, the contor- tions of the carotid artery as it enters the skull, the manner in which it lies in the cavernous sinus, and, finally, the minute division which it undergoes by spreading over the pia mater before it enters the brain, are sufficient. In Man there is not the smallest vestige of a rete mirabile; and whenever we find a rete mirabile described in Man (as often it has been described), we find invariably that it means no more than the plexus of delicate vessels which go out from the first twigs of the carotid artery, either to supply Vol. II.

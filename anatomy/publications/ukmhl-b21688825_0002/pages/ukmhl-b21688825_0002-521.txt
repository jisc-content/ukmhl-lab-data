Â©F THE PELVIS* 449 sheath, which binds the corpora cavernosa. Thus ends the perinseal artery. ARTERIA PENIS. The proper artery of the penis is the continued trunk of the pudic artery. It is much larger than this perinseal branch; is as big as a crow quill; it keeps still close to the bone, while the perinseal artery goes out- wards; it at last touches the symphysis pubis, and of course pierces the corpus cavernosum,just where it takes its rise from the leg of the pubis : and here it splits into two great branches; one to the corpus cavernosum, and one to the back of the penis, or rather into three, since there is one also for the bulb of the urethra. The bulb of the urethra is quite insulated in the perinaeum, while the corpora cavernosa arise from the bone. Now, first, as the artery of the penis is pasting by the side of the bulb, it gives off an artery to the bulb sidewise, which in part plunges into the bulbous substance, and in part is scattered upon the accelerator, prostate gland, he. Secondly. The artery having risen to the place where the root of the corpus cavernosum is, gives off that artery, which runs small and delicate along all the back of the penis, till it ends at last in a branch which encircles the corona glandis. This is named the mrteria dorsalis penis. dhirdly, The artery now plunges de;-p into the proper substance of the penis; the artery of each side goes into each corpus cavernosum at its root, and splits into two branches; these run chiefly along the septum, or partition betwixt the corpora cavernosa of each side.

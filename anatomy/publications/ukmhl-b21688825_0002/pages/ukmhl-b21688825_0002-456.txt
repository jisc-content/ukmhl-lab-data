OP THE ARTERIES. 388 passes up under cover of the pronator teres, lies close upon the forepart of the inner condyle, and Is of importance, not only by its own size, but also by its anastomosing with the ramus anastomoticus major* which is the largest of the arteries from above. RECURRENS ULNAJIIS POSTERIOR. The posterior recurrent of the ulnar artery is often a branch of the anterior one, coming off with it in one common trunk. When it comes off apart* it arises a little lower; it is a larger and stronger ar- tery, i. e. it makes as full inosculations, goe,-. farther, and gives more branches to the muscles. This pos- terior recurrent arises from the ulnar at that place where it perforates the bellies of the flexor muscles; it also dives through betwixt the two bellies of the flexor muscles of the fingers, it thus gets round the condyle, for these two muscles arise together, from the condyle: the artery gives many branches both to the pronator and flexor muscles, and to the perio- steum, and capsule of the joint; it then lodges itself in the deep hollow which is betwixt the olecranum and the condyle, where the ulnar nerve lies (that nerve which we feel so benumbed when we strike the inner side of the elbow). The artery stretching upwards along the bone, meets a similar descending branch from the upper profunda, and inosculate with it. As far as we yet know, the whole weight of the business in saving the arm after aneurisms depends upon these two arteries. In Mr.' Whiteâ€™s preparation it. is the anterior branch which is enlarged, inosculating with

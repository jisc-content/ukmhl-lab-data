135 OF RESPIRATION. the thorax be laid open ; thirdly. That when the breast is entirely laid open, the lungs continue to move, and the thorax also continues to move, but that the motion of the thorax never keeps time with the motions of the lungs. But, to do Houston justice, he endeavoured to explain away the inconsistencies of his own experi- ments ; and the world would never have been troubled any more with them, had it not been for a Mr. Bre- mond, a great academician, philosopher, and expert* ment-maker, who published the following suite of ex- periments in the academy of Paris. His first mistake is this. “ I found (says he) that having stabbed a Dog in one side only, it could run about the house and howl.” This is what nobody will doubt. “ But also (says he) the air which the Dog took in by the wound when it expired, was pressed out again by the wound when it inspired.” This is one cunning stroke of Mr. Bremond; for had the air entered the chest during inspiration, that must have proceeded from the rising of the thorax, w'hich is not the kind of respiration which he wanted to prove j But as the air entered the chest during expiration, it proceeds clearly according to his principles, that the lungs in squeezing out their air have a contractile power; that they contract by their own motion, and leave the ribs, and so make room for the air. “ Next (says Mr, Bremond,) I opened the thorax of a living Dog, and there I saw, that when the lungs con- tracted the thorax dilated, and v/hen the thorax con- tracted the lungs dilated.”—But, in fact, it means no more than this, that often in these agonies produced by such cruel experiments upon animals, or by actual K 4 wounds

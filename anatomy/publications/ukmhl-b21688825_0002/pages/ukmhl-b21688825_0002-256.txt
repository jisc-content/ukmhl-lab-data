192 CIRCULATION OF most admired on the continent for his Physiology, says, at p. 80. “ Post extremam respirationem rede- unti per venas cavas sanguini via sueta in pulmones nunc collapsos prascludatur Thus I have proved, that it has been the opinion down to the present day, that the collapse or over- distention of the lungs are both equally opposite to the easy passage of the blood: but instead of going round about the matter slyly, as some lesser authors have done, I like rather the manner of the Reverend Dr. Hales, who says plumply, ‘4 that suffocation con- sists in the falling flat of the. lungs,” (p. 271.) He talks in this way, becaus^like Buffon, Derham, Des Cartes and some others, he was a philosopher by inclination, and by force a sort of an anatomist. Now, the condition of the human lungs is quite opposite to all this ; and also (in respect of distention) is less different from the lungs of reptiles than it is easy for any one bred up in the old doctrines to conceive. In expiration the lungs do not even collapse in any sensible degree. Let us take for our data the com- mon calculations concerning the quantity of air in the lungs, and let us see what they will do towards prov- ing this opinion. The lungs are supposed to contain * Mr. Kite, one of the latest writers on the recovery of drowned persons, has the same notion, “ We inflate and empty the luDgs (says he), in order by their expansion and contraction to force the blood across from the right to the left side of the heart,”—and he expresses himself as perfectly indifferent what kind of air be used, foul or pure is all one. at

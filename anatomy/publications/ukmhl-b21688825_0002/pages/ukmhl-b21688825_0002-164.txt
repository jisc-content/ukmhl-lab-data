OF THE BLOOD, 112 calcination, and generation of acid, ali in one process the product being named indifferently oxyd of arsenic, or white calx of arsenic*. But. if most acidiliable bases be thus forced by combination to forsake their solid and assume their aerial form, others more singular still are recalled from their aerial form, and condensed into the fluid form of a strong acid. Thus azotic or nitrogene air, which forms the great bulk of our atmosphere, is converted by oxygenous or pure air into an acid formfj it becomes nitrous acid, nitric acid, nitrous air, strong or weak according to the various degrees of oxygenation communicated to it; and thus nitrous air, by its appetite for oxygene, and by its change of colour and its condensation, whenever it takes oxy- gene from the air, makes a eudiometer or measure for the purity of the air j and, according to the purity of the atmosphere, more turbidness and more redness is produced in the nitrous air, and a greater loss of bulk, which may be marked on a scale. Thus are all acids formed of an acidifiable basis, vari- ous each according to its kind, on which the variety of acids depends; but these all become acid by the ad- dition of one uniform principle, viz. the basis of pure * It is necessary to add nitre to make it burn. The result is not directly an acid, but a neutral salt formed of the arsenical acid joined to the alkali of nitre ; without the help of nitrous acid it is only an oxyd or imperfect acid,; and it is necessary to use the hyper-oxygenated muriatic acid for communicating to it a sufli* eiency of oxygene to constitute it a perfect acid. + N, B.

,120. OF THE BLOOO. each new edition of the book on animal heat must be prefaced with new apologies, new confessions, new corrections, new calculations, unhinging so entirely the conclusions and calculations of former copies of It, that we find ourselves engaged, along with our in- structor, in a wilderness of errors, from which we can have no hopes .of being extricated. Oxydation is a process whig!} had no place in Dr. Crawfordâ€™s views; he never conceived that it was the presence of oxygene, as a new principle, which gave colour, stimulant powers, coagulability, and all its most useful properties, to the blood; but he believed that pure air, uniting with inflammable air in the lungs* formed fixed air; and this fixed air being incapable of containing the heat which it had while in the state of pure air, that heat was deposited, or, as it were, pre- ^ cipitated upon the blood. He maintains, that there are of inflammable air two kinds; one capable of forming water, another of forming fixed air ; but fix- ed air, derived from inflammable gas of any kind, al! chemists wdl deny. He begins his doctrine, there- fore, not with a fact, but with a petitio principii; and what is worse, his main experiment is wrong. He was extremely anxious to prove, that in proportion as air was changed by respiration, it gave out its heat to the blood; he also wished to put respiration and com- bustion on one level; and by this second thought he forgot entirely v/hat he first had it in mind to prove. Accordingly, having inclosed a Guinea-pig in pure air, and under water, he found that the air which it had respired'communicated nearly the same heat to- water that- burning the same quantity of air would have

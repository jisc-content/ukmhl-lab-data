284 OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID, from the back of the nostril till it emerges upon the face. The infra-orbital, and the branch last described, viz. the alveolar artery, generally come off from the maxillary by one common trunk; the alveolar goes forwards and downwards by the back of the antrum ; the infra-orbital mounts upwards, and enters the spheno-m axillary hole, or rather it comes off just at the spheno-maxillary hole, which is the great slit at the bottom of the eye. As the artery enters its proper canal at the bottom of the eye, it gives some twigs to the periosteum and to the fat of the socket; as it passes along its canal in the bone, one branch dives down into the antrum through the bone; for this plate of bone in which its groove runs, is at once the floor of the eye and the roof of the antrum ; within the socket it gives twigs also to the deprimens occuli, and to the lower oblique muscle, to the lachrymal sac, or even to the nostrils ; when it emerges from the socket by the infra-orbitary hole, it terminates in the levator iabii and levator anguli oris, and in inosculations with the arteria buccalis, labialis, and especially with the nasal branch of the occular artery. This infra-orbif tary artery is accompanied through the canal, and out upon the face, with a small nerve of the same name, viz. the infra-orbitary nerve. After this the maxillary, though nearly exhausted, still sends out three small arteries, in which it termi- nates irregularly, sometimes one, sometimes another twig being larger. Of these three, one goes to the palate, one to the pharynx, one to the nostrils. 9. The upper palatine artery arises near the infra-orbital j and from that point, viz. the spheno-: maxillary

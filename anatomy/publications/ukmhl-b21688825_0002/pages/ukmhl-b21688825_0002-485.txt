417 STOMACH, LIVER, AND SPLEEN. two arteries may be described thus: The duodenum begins from the pylorus ; the pancreas pours its liquor into the duodenum; and therefore the head of the pancreas is attached to the duodenum : this marks the point at which the trunk of the arteria buodeno- gastrica goes off; for it rises at right angles from the hepatic; it lies behind the lower end of the stomach just between the pylorus and pancreas; there it splits into its two great branches, viz, to the duodenum and to the stomach. But besides these two great branches there are subordinate arteries, which must be enu- merated together with them. One artery goes off to the upper and back part of the duodenum over the biliary ducts; next go off small arteries to the duodenum of still less importance, and nameless ; and at the same place small twigs are often given to the pancreas. The first which is distinguished or regular, or has a name, is the pyloric a inferior, the lower pyloric artery. It goes off from the pancreatico-duo- denalis almost as soon as it touches the duodenum ; there are sometimes two or more pyloric arteries going off at this point; they encircle the pylorus with deli- cate branches ; and at the same time turn obliquely upwards, to receive inosculations from the upper pyloric, which comes from the artery of the stomach. The next artery to be- distinguished by a peculiar name is one which goes off directly opposite to this, belongs to the pancreas, and is named, from its run- ning transversely across the pancreas, the transverse pancreatic artery. It is a neat small branch, Vol. II, E e which

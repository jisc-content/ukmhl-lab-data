324 ARTERIES OF THE EYE. Of these vagrant branches, one twig goes to the periosteum of the orbit, perforates the cheek bone, and so gets into the hollow of the temple, inosculating with the deep temporal artery; while another little branch goes to the tarsus of the upper eyelid, and another to the tarsus of the lower eyelid, and thus ends the lachrymal artery. SECOND ORDER. In the second order are included the arteries which go to the eye itself, viz. the arteria centralis retinte, and the ciliary arteries; of which arteries there is none more curious than the arteria centralis retinae. 1* ARTERIA CENTRALIS RETINAS. This artery is so named because it perforates the optic nerve, runs up through its very centre or axis, enters into the cavity of the eye through the very centre of the optic nerve, and spreads its branches all over the retina. It usually arises from the ophthal- mic artery, where it turns in the middle of the orbit over the upper part of the optic nerve*; it plunges into the nerve; and this artery, or rather the artery and vein, both (for the vein accompanies it) make so large a canal in the centre of the optic nerve, * It may be found arising from the ciliary arteries, or sometime* from the muscular. that

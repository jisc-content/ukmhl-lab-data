OF THE FOREARM. 402 belovr the elbow into the interossea anterior and inter- ossea posterior : next the interossea post erior gives off the posterior or interosseous recurrent. That artery is already described ; and I proceed to describe now the course of the two interosseous arteries. First, The anterior interosseous artery is the conti- nued trunk, for it goes straight forwards, and is lar- ger ; while the posterior interosseous is smaller, turns out of the straight course to perforate the membrane, and is exhausted before it reaches the wrist. The anterior interosseous artery lies flat upon the forepart of the interosseous membrane ; is larger than a crow-quill, or about half the diameter of the radial artery. As it goes down the forearm, it gives branches to all the muscles ; it gives the nutritious arteries of the radius and ulna ; it goes forwards, and, ending in small branches under the anular ligament of the wrist, it makes beautiful net-works and anastomosis over the capsular joints of the carpus. Secondly, The posterior interosseous artery turns through the interosseous ligament about two inches below the elbow joint. It instantly gives off the in- terosseous recurrent ; which being very large, the ar- tery seems to be divided into two equal branches, of which one is the recurrent, turning upwards towards the elbow-joint; the other is the posterior interosseous itself, running downwards, and distributing its branches among all the great bellies of the extensor muscles which lie on the outside of the forearm. Thirdly, There is something like a second interossea posterior; for the anterior interosseous artery sends off, about four inches above the wrist, another artery, Vql. II. D d but

RESPIRATION. air in the water, or not enough of air, they cannot breath ; distilled water is to a fish what the vacuum, of an air-purno, is to a breathing creature : if you exhaust water with an air-pump, if yoif boil it, if you distil it, if in any way you deprive it of its air, fishes cannot breathe in it, but come up to the sur- face and gasp for air. If vou take a fish out into the air, it is the same with plunging any breathing crea- ture into water, it gasps and dies. Fishes cannot breathe in air wanting water, for that element is not accommodated to their species of I mgs; nor in water wanting air, for then there is no oxygene; and we find, upon extracting the air from water which fishes have breathed, that it contaminated, exact iv in the same way with air which had been breathed by any breathing animal, that it differs very little from that in which a candle has burnt out. This is the reason that when many small fifties are inclosed in a narrow glass, they all struggle for the uppermost place, and that when in winter a fish-pond is entirely frozen over, you must break holes for the fishes, not that they may come and feed, but that they may come and breathe ; without this, if the pond be small, they must die. In the respiration of fishes, there are two curious points to be considered: First, The manner in which their respiration is performed; and secondly, The manner in which their blood, when thus oxydated, is distributed over the body. The red part or gills, which serve as lungs, lie under a broad scale, which defends them from all ex- traneous bodies, or hurt, or pressure of any kind, for they

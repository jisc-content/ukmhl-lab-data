71 OF THE BLOOD. other orders.—Whence by analogy we are to conceive globules of the third order made up of six globules of the fourth order, and these of six of the fifth order, and so on ad infinitum through various degrees, the number of which we are not to take upon us to de- termine.” This is a pleasant addition of Dr. Martin’s; and makes it a most manageable system of most di- latable materials, stretching so as to suit all occa- sions. This rider or codicii to the doctrine made it easy for every particle to pass every vessel; but, alas ! it leaves no room for that old catchword of the sys- tem, the error loci, nor any provision for making diseases. How all the physicians in Europe could digest this absurdity, of yellow particles, by aggregation and arrangements in sixes and sixes, becoming red, it is not easy to conceive; nor is it easy to conceive how men, whose education in mathematics and algebra should have taught them to think accurately and reason closely, could believe that globules should break down into six particles each, and that these particles, being themselves particles of serum, should yet be distinctly seen floating in the serum. Kow could these geome- trical physicians possibly believe, that these particles, from large to small, should descend, not gradually and imperceptibly, but by sixes and sixes, one after another like steps of stairs ? In all his mathematics, I do not believe that Martin could find any contrivance fit to help him out of these difficulties. Martin observes, in his own way of geometry, and proceeds to prove it by most laborious schemes, “ that just six small sphe- ricies should go to make up one larger globule, if you F 4 were /

OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY. 479 it appears again at the edge of the vastus externus: one branch plunges into the vastus externus, mounts upwards, and besides supplying the muscle, inoscu- lates with the long descending branch of the reflexa externa; while another branch turns as directly down- wards over the face of the outer condyle, and spreads beautifully over the side of the joint, inosculating in many net-works with the corresponding artery from below. ARTERIA ARTICULARIS SUPERIOR INTERNA. The upper articular artery of the inner side goes off in like manner over the inner condyle, pierces the tendon of the triceps, where it is implanted into the condyle, and passing under the edge of the vastus internus, turns towards the forepart of the knee, proceeds towards the patella, and covers chiefly the inner side of the joint with its net-work of inoscula- tions ; its little twigs slip in under the great lateral ligament, and under the sides of the patella 10 the cavity of the joint itself. It inosculates like the outer artery with the lower arteries of its own side. ARTERIA ARTICULARIS MEDIA. The middle or azygous articular artery usually arises from the back part of the popliteal artery, but sometimes from one or other of those last described; but this branch, at all events, is seldom wanting. It runs down behind the main artery upon the back part of the joint, into the great hollow betwixt the condyles; and all its branches are ex- pended' upon the back of the capsule, the posterior crucial

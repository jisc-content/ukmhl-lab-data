OF THE ARTERIES 40S k. . § 2. ARTERIES OF THE ABDOMEN. AORTA ABDOMINALIS. The aorta descends into the belly under that arch which is formed by the legs of the diaphragm. It passes along the left side of the spine ; but now, upon emerging into the abdomen, it inclines nearer to the middle of that ridge which is formed by the vertebrae. The flat and tendinous legs of the diaphragm not only stride over the aorta, so as to form an arch appa- rently for its protection; but the uppermost part of the crura turns flat under it, so as to embrace it. No vein goes along with the aorta; for the cava, which returns all its blood, leaves it a little above the pelvis, and inclines towards the right side, that it may enter into the right side of the heart, which it does by pas- sing under the liver. But the aorta has other very important connections j for as one of its -first arteries is the great artery of the intestines, of course the root of the mesentery (the membrane which conducts the arteries of the intes- tines) lies over the aorta; and as the mesentery con- ducts the lacteals from the intestines, of course the meeting of the lacteals and of the lymphatics, or, in other words, the beginning of the thoracic duct, is at the side of the aorta.

329 ARTERIES OF THE EYE, tha uvea and iris, so as to make a very important con- nection of all the vascular parts of the eye. Secondly, The longer ciliary arteries enter the sclerotic a little further forward, penetrate at a greater distance from 'the optic nerve, they penetrate the sclerotic a little before its middle; but still they continue entire, or they give but very small branches. When they approach the ciliary circle, they divide into two or three long arteries, which go off at right angles, embracing a corresponding quarter of the ciliary circle: from these arms their branches meet each other, and are now joined both by the shorter ciliary arteries and by the anterior ciliary arteries; by which conjunction an arterial circle is formed which corresponds with the outer circle of the uvea* and is called the outer ciliary circle : this again sends radii of vessels, perhaps thirty, inwards, which meeting form a second circle, the inner ciliary CIRCLE. Thirdly, The anterior ciliary arteries again enter the eye at its fore part, and immediately unite with these, as has just been explained; they help to form the ciliary circle, which is the great conjunction of all the internal vessels of the eye. THIRD ORDER. In this order are included the muscular arteries, which are the least regular of all the branches of the ophthalmic artery. From one or other branch of the ophthalmic

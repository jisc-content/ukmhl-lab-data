OF THE PERICARDIUM. 55 water will be found in the pericardium. When such fluid is to be found, it is of the same nature with the dropsical fluids of other cavities: in the child, and in young people, it is reddish, especially if the pericar- dium be inflamed ; in older people it is pellucid, or of a light straw colour '; in old age and in the larger animals it is thicker, and more directly resembles the liquor of a joint. Thus does the pericardium contribute in some de- gree to settle the posture of the heart; but still the heart is almost entirely loose and free. It is fixed by nothing but its great vessels as they run up towards the neck, or are connected with the spine; but how slight this hold is, how much the heart must be moved and these vessels endangered, by shocks and falls, it is awful to think. The pericardium is no doubt some restraint: its connections with the diaphragm and with the mediastinum make it a provision, in some degree, against any violent shock; its internal lubricity is, at the same time, a means of making the heartâ€™s motions more free: yet the heart rolls about in the thorax, we turn to our left side in bed, and it beats there ; we turn over to our right side, and the heart falls back into the chest, so that its pulse is nowhere to be per- ceived ; we incline to our left side again, and it beats quick and strong. The heart is raised by a full sto- mach, and is pushed upwards in dropsy; and during pregnancy its posture is remarkably changed; it is suddenly depressed again when the child is delivered, or the waters of a dropsy drawn off. It is shaken by coughing, laughing, sneezing, and every violent ef- E 4- fort

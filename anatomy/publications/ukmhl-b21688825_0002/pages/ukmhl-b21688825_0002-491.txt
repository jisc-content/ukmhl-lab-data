421 STOMACH, LIVER, AND SPLEEN. the abdomen), and gives arteries to it; when it ap- proaches the spleen, it gives off that great artery which returns along the lower border of the stomach, and when it actually arrives at the spleen, it divides into a great many branches, which enter by the concave surface of the spleen, and plunge into its substance. The branches then, of the splenic artery, are these; 1. It gives a great artery to the pancreas named pan- creatic a magna, which passes to the right under the pancreas, and belongs chiefly to the head of the pan- creas, or that rounded end which is next to the duo- denum. Though named magna, it is a variable ar- tery, and of little importance. 2. All along, as the splenic artery is passing to the left by the border of the pancreas, it sends short branches into it. They are named pancreatic.Â® par vie, or small pancreatic arteries. 3. It often sends small arteries upwards to the back part of the stomach named posterior gas- tric arteries. 4. The gastro-i piploic a sinis- tra, or the left gastro-epiploic artery, is a very large and principal branch of the splenic artery. It arises under the stomach a little beyond the left or larger head of the pancreas ; it makes a large arch, and then turns with a serpentine turn towards the stomach, returns along the lower border of the stomach within the doubling of the omentum, and gives its arteries upwards to the stomach and downwards upon the omentum, so much like those of the right gastro-epiploic artery, that when they meet in the middle of the great arch of the stomach, and inrscalate, we cannot distinguish where either of them ends; the chief difference is, that E e 3 some

GENERAL PLAN OP 246 with the power of a second ventricle: in the Frog we find its internal surface beset with a triple row of valves, and its coats are like those of a ventricle, they are so exceedingly strong: In Man we find it plainly muscular, surrounded in circles with great fibres, and having much muscular power. The beginning of the aorta, then, lies deep in the flesh of the heart; it is there that it gives off its coronary arteries ; it bulges at its root into three great knobs, which mark the place of its three valves, and are called the lesser sinuses of the aorta; it is large at the root, it grows smaller as it rises, it mounts upwards and backwards from the heart, till it begins to form its arch or curvature; its direction is first towards the right side of the thorax; looking backwards, it turns in a very distorted manner, where it forms the arch; it strides over the root of the lungs, going now to the -left side and backward, till it touches the spine; its arch lies so upon the forking of the treachea, that its aneurisms often burst into the lungs: it then applies itself close to the spine, so that in aneurisms the pres- sure of the aorta often destroys the vertebrze; and now lying along the left side of the spine, and with the oesophagus running close by it, it passes down through the thorax, and from that to the belly under the legs of the diaphragm. This, then, may serve as a short description of the aorta, which is the root of all those arteries which we proceed now to explain. Its structure is strong, mus- cular, and continually active, performing the office of a second heart. When in old age it begins to lose this muscular power, to have its fibres embarrassed with chalky,

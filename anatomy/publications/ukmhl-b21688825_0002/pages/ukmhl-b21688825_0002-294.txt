They even mistook such clots for living animals. Dr. Edward May sent from England to the celebrated Severinus a description of an Eel which he had found in the cavity of the heart. He entitles it, with some 4 propriety, “ Historia mirabilis anguis bifidi.” It is, indeed, a wonderful story; they describe head and tail, and all fairly, as if it had been bona fide a Jiving creature, and tell us how its head was sticking to the inside of the heart (where you may suppose it was biting), and how its body was very white and very strong, and its arms or tails, I do not know what to call them, red.

OF THE BLOOD. 119 lungs, have established their doctrines on very fan- tastical and absurd laws; not merely of chemical changes producing heat in the lungs, but of the blood acquiring a greater capacity for heat than those substances have from which the blood itself is formed. The blood is formed from flesh, milk, wheat, rye, barley, and various other foods: these are curiously measured; the degree of heat which they communicate to water is assumed as the truth of their absolute heat: the absolute heat of all kinds of food is declared to be greatly lower than that of the blood itself; and this accumulation of heat in the blood is taken as a sure proof, that in respiration much heat is deposited upon the blood, it having a greater appetite or capacity for heat. But concerning this doctrine, which in its philoso- phical as well as in its chemical part is now antiquated it is allowable to say, more freely than of almost any other, that its intricacies are its beauties; that it is a hypothesis illustrated by experiments, which have no other tendency than “ to make it look well in the face;” and which are made with such affectation of niceness as is completely ludicrous. The author pre- tends to measure, to the tenth part of a degree, the proportions of heat in wheat, barley, flesh, milk, &c. Airs he also measures, showing the various capacities for heat in the different kinds of air to the tenth part of a degree; a thing much fitter for a magician than a philosopher to undertake; and which Dr Crawford has executed so ill, that we are teased, or rather tho- roughly exhausted, before we begin, with correctin .measures and instruments and settling data; wnile I 4 each

346 OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. and ends at the cartilago ensiformis in numerous inosculations with the epigastric artery ; for the epi- gastric arises from the femoral at the groin, just as this does from the subclavian at the top of the chest, and runs upwards along the belly, as this the mam- mary runs downwards along the breast till they meet each other midway. This is an inosculation, which fifty years ago was inuch noticed. Physiologists deduced the most important consequences from it, ascribing the connection of the breast and womb to the flax and reflux, to the alternate stoppage and accelera- tion of the blood in these vessels; although the sym- pathy of the breasts and womb is plainly a connection which Nature has established upon other laws, upon a kind of sympathy such as we see everywhere in the system, but can in no instance explain. The course of the mammary artery and the order of its branches, is this: It goes off from the lower and fore part of the axillary artery; it lies on the outside ofthe membranous bag of the pleura; and considering the pleura as ending in an obtuse and rising apex, the mammary artery lies at first a little behind the pleura, its first movement is to rise and turn with an arch over the top of the pleura or bag which incloses the cavity of the chest; there it descends again, and passes betwixt the riba and pleura ; the artery runs along the inside of the thorax under the middle of the cartilages. At the seventh or eighth rib the mam- mary itself emerges from the thorax, and becomes an external artery; it first sends a branch towards the ensiform cartilage, which plays round it, and then it goes to the upper part of the abdominal muscles by two

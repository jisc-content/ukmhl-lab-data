70 Without mechanical confinement. Will not a wire when electrified continue to he so, if surrounded by non-conductors ? Experiments made on the limbs of ani- mals with electricity, produced in the mannei first explained by Volta, shew th.it different parts of the body have dif- ferent conducting powers. Skin and mem- brane being very bad conductors, and brain, muscle, and blood being remarkably good ones. The celerity with which motions are transmitted from the tangible extremities of nerves most distant from the brain, and the celerity with which volition is transmitted to the muscles, in consequence of sensations thus induced, are sufficient to convince us that such effects must be produced by the motions of a very mo- bile substance.' It is not necessary to suppose that when such motions are trans-

though the nervous fibrils in each packet appear distinct, and may be separated from each other in the manner already described, yet they have nevertheless transverse com- munications with each other. Each nervous fibre has been supposed to be covered by investing membranes similar to those of the brain; but this opinion is founded on an analogy with what is observed in the optic nerve, rather than on ac- tual observation with respect to others. That they have investing membranes is clear, and we are told that we may dis- solve the medullary or nervous matter by an alkali, and leave these investing membranes; or on the other hand, that we may dissolve the investing membranes by nitric acid, and leave the medullary fibres.

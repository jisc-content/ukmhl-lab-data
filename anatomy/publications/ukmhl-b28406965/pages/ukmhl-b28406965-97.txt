Now though chemists may solve the cause of these phenomena, physiologists have vet to learn, and probably they never may learn, why certain actions succeed to certain causes in living bodies. Causes which induce muscular or nervous actions in one part do not induce similar ac- tions in another. Both muscles and nerves have peculiar habitudes and modes of action, and require the application of various peculiar excitements. Causes which pro- duce no bad effect upon one person, will have a detrimental influence upon another, and this we say is the result of idiosyn- crasy. Thus the odour of a cat, or the effluvia of mutton, the one imperceptible, the other grateful to the generality of persons, has caused individuals to fall on the ground as though bereaved of life, or to have their whole frame agi- tated by convulsions. Substances which in- â€¢i duce disease in one person or animal, do not induce disease in others. That

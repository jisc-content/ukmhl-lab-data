71 mitted along the nervous chords, an evident â€¢ motion of the visible matter of those chords should be induced. Electrical motions take place along a wire without occasioning any visible motion of the metal itself. Formerly, it was thought that the mo- tions of the nerves that cause sensation, were the effect of an impulse made on their tangible extremities, which was pro- pagated along the chord to the brain. It seems to be an improvement in modem physiology, to attribute sensation to an action begun in the nervous fibrils, in consequence of the stimulation which they suffer from such impulses. This opiuion is contended lor by Doctor Darwin, in his paper on Ocular Spectra, published in the Philosophical Transactions; and Sir Everard Home has further shewn, that the living principle of nerves has an ir- ritability belonging to it. resembling that m

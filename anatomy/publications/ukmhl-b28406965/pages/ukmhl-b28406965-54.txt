42 \ The phenomena of electricity and of life correspond. Electricity may be at- tached to, or inhere, in a wire; it may be suddenly dissipated, or have its powers annulled, or it may be removed by de- grees or in portions, and the wire may remain less and less strongly electrified, in proportion as it is abstracted. So life inheres in vegetables and animals; it may sometimes be suddenly dissipated, or have its powers abolished, though in general it is lost by degrees, without any apparent change taking place in the structure; and in either case putrefaction begins when life terminates. P. if The motions of electricity are charac- terized by their celerity and force ; so are the motions of irritability. The mo- tions of electricity are vibratory ; so like- wise are those of irritability. When by long continued exertion the power of

68 exists in the brain, and that volition pro- ceeds from that organ, it necessarily fol- lows that motions must be transmitted to and fro along the nervous chords, whenever they take place. It was formerly supposed that these chords were passive, and might be made mechanically to vibrate, but their want of elasticity and tension, and their pulpy origins and terminations, are circumstances which render such a sup- position inadmissible. Physiologists were therefore led to conjecture that the ner- vous fibrils were tubular, and that they contained a subtile fluid, by means of which such motions were transmitted. Of the extensive knowledge and high intellectual powers of Baron Haller no one can entertain a doubt; and yet, he could devise no other theory to account for the phenomena of the nervous func- tions. His opinions have ahvays appear- i

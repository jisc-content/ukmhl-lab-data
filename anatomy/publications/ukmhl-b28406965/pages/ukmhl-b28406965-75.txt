from a nervous packet, in the manner before mentioned, though too minute to admit of further subdivision, appear by the microscope to be themselves packets of smaller threads. It is generally as- serted by microscopical observers, that the nerves and medullary matter of the brain and spinal marrow are the same, and are composed of very minute fibres. Fontana speaks confidently on this point; and he further says, that he has seen these nervous fibres regenerated in the medium which has been formed to unite a divid- ed nerve. He describes the nervous fibres in every part of the nervous sys- tem as cylindrical, pursuing a slightly un- dulating course, and being in a consi- derable degree transparent. He states also that they are larger than the ulti- mate fibres of muscles. Microscopical observers also tell us, that

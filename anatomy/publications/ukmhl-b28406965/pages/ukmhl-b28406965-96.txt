84 are not warranted in supposing there is any sensation such as I have defined. Assuredly, motion does not necessarily imply sensation; it takes place where no one ever yet imagined there could be sensation. If I put on the table a bason containing a saturated solution of salt, and threw into it a single crystal; the act of crystallization would begin from the point touched, and rapidly and regularly pervade the liquor till it as- sumed a solid form. Yet I know I should incur your ridicule, if I suggested the idea that the stimulus of the salt had primarily excited the action, or that its extension was the effect of continuous sympathy. If also I threw a spark amongst gun-powder, what would you think were I to represent the explosion as a struggle resentful of injury, or the noise as the clamorous expression of pain ?

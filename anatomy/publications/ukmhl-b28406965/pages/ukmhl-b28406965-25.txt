13 Besides, we never can be sure, that the series of facts belonging to any subject is full or complete; new ones may be dis- covered, that would overturn our best es- tablished theories. Upon the foregoing terms alone do I wish to uphold Mr. Hunterâ€™s theory of life ; and I do so on the present occasion, because it seems highly probable, it was his think- ing in the manner he was known to do, that caused him to survey all the facts connected with the subject of life in general with so much accuracv, as well as to note its disordered states and sympathies in a manner which has so greatly contributed to increase our practical knowledge. It is highly probable that it was his hypo- thesis respecting life which incited him to enquiries by which he has been able to supply the deficient facts, so as to es- tablish his conjectures, or convert his hy- pothesis into a theory.

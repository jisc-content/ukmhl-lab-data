768 ORGANS OF SECRETION. 9. DEEP LYMPHATIC VESSELS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 2792. I.ymphatics of the Brain. The lymphatic vessels of the brain and its membranes are not yet known in a satisfactory man- ner. Although the most minute researches have been made in those parts, there have only been distinctly traced a few trunks that are met with in the dura mater. 2793.

They all follow the coiirse of the blood-vessels, gain the subparotid ganglia and those which en- velope the internal jugular veins. They then divide a great num- ber of times, join some trunks coming from the larynx and thy- roid body, and open partly into the right and left internal jugular and subclavian veins, partly into the thoracic duct to the left, and into the great lymphatic vein to the right, by a greater or less number of trunks.

These organs, by their continuity, constitute a double oro-an, placed symmetrically on either side of the median line of’the body, and extending from the outer and upper region of each orbit, to the inferior meatus of the nasal fossae. These two apparatus are pretty frequently designated by the collective name of Fioe lachryniales. Each of them consists of the lachry- mal gland, the puncta lachrymalia, lachrymal ducts, lachrymal sac, and nasal canal. 1. OF THE LACHEYMAL GLAND. 2785. The Lachrymal Gland (Glandula Lachrymalis) is lodged in a depression of the frontal bone, at the upper, outer, and

PUEFACIi Vll with equal care, and nearly equal minuteness. They do not presume to prejudge the relative importance of cer- tain regions of the body, and to measure the degree of attention which the student and surgeon should devote to some, and the measure of neglect to other parts of the body. They do not inculcate to their readers that the mus- cles of the back are altogether unimportant; a minute knowledge of the bones unnecessary; the smaller ar- teries not worth remembering, and the anatomy of the nerves absolutely useless. These doctrines, wherever or by whomsoever taught, are peculiarly dangerous to the student; if listened to for a moment, they must destroy his views for ever. There are many persons, indeed, some of them, I re- gret to say, teachers of anatomy, who seem to think that anatomy in itself is the most tiresome, disgusting, and uninteresting of all studies; and, proceeding on this notion, pregnant with dangerous consequences to the profession and to the science, have taught anatomy as a mere appendage to surgery ; and carrying into a liberal profession their own empirical views, have rejected, and anxiously taught others to reject every anatomical fact which did not lead to the â€œ dextrous performance of some cunning and skilful operation in surgery, the execution of which should be most profitable to the surgeon or they have compounded it, to use a pro- fessional phrase and metaphor, with medicine, physio- logy, and pathology, as if anatomy were a nauseous draught lequiring to be masked by some palatable, over- powering ingredient. And this is the language held of a science, most exact in itself, most interesting and im- portant to the human race, the foundation of the philoso- phy of living beings, and the only basis on which the superstructure of medicine, surgery, and physiology can be raised.

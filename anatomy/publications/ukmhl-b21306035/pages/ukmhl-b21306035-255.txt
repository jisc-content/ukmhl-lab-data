239 CLASSIFICATION OF THE MUSCLES. 6. CLASSIFICATION QF THE MUSCLES. 801. Anatomists have successively introduced various modes of dividing the muscles. Some, and in particular Winslow, have ar- ranged them according to their uses. Albinus, Sabatier, Boyer, and Bichat have employed a method which appears to us more congenial to a descriptive science; they have distributed them ac- cording to the different parts of the body which they occupy; and each of these parts has received the name of a Region. It is this classiffcation which we adopt as the more elementary,* and which we now proceed to unfold in a general manner. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. I. MUSCLES OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 1.

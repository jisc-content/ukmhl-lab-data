163 OF THE ARTfCU.LATIONS. CHAPTER SECOND. OF THE ARTICULATIONS. I.—PRELIMINARY REMARKS. 553. The bones are not connected by a continuity of substance from one end of the body to the other, as is the case with several systems of organs, the nerves and vessels in particular. They are contiguous to each other in many of their points, and it is their mu- tual connection, the manner in which they meet and are fitted to each other, their mode of union, whatever it may be, that is desig- nated by the name of Articulation. It is by means of articula- tions that the osseous system forms a whole, which constitutes the Skeleton. II.—DIVISIONS OF THE ARTICULATIONS. 554. In the long bones, it is by the extremities that the articu- lations take place; in the broad bones, it is commonly by the edges ; in the short bones, by various points of the surface. 555. The articulations are naturally divided into two general classes, according as they retain the bones together without admit- ting motion, or permit motion to take place. The former, which belong peculiarly to the bones which unite to form cavities destined to protect the organs, such as the head, the pelvis, &c. are themselves subdivided into different orders, de- pendent upon the conformation of the surfaces which concur to form them. Thus, these surfaces may be, 1st, Simply placed in juxtaposi- tion, which is the case in places where the bones must preserve their mutual relations in a permanent manner, by their very posi- tion, as is observed at the base of the skull and in the articulation of most of the bones of the face, where the mechanism of the part is of itself sufficient to ensure solidity. 2dly, They are inter- locked, if the general mechanism of the region is insufficient to maintain this solidity. They then present asperities and depres-

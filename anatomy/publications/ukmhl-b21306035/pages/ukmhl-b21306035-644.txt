These two notches are continued into each other by a groove which pre- vails along the anterior surface of the thymus gland. 2164). This organ is enveloped by a very thin globular capsule, which sends prolongations into its interior, and thus divides its soft yellowish or whitish parenchyma into lobules of unequal size, in each of which there are distinguished several vesicles tilled with a milky and slightly viscous fluid, and appearing to communicate with each other in the whole extent of the organ. No excretory duct has been discovered for it, but it is traversed by blood-vessels and lymphatics. Its arteries, although of a small size, are pretty numerous. They arise from the inferior thyroid, internal mammary, bronchial, mediastinal and pericardiac arteries. The veins precise- ly correspond to the arteries. It receives some nervous filaments from the pneumo-gastric and diaphragmatic (1667) nerves, and from the inferior cervical ganglia. CLASS SECOND. ARTICLE THIRD.

The Pericardium is a membranous bag which envelopes the heart and the arterial and venous trunks which issue from or enter into it. It is lodged in the inferior separation of the ante- rior mediastinum, above the central aponeurosis of the diaphragm, to which it is strongly united. Its foi'm is, at first sight, that of a cone, with the base directed downwards "and a little to the left; but when freed of the fat in which it is, as it were, immersed, and ex- tricated from the laminae of the mediastinum, it is found to be ex- IIij/, circa; cor.

795 OF THE ENVELOPES OF THE TESTICLES. CLASS THIRD. ARTICLE FIRST. ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE MALE. 2891. The organs of generation in the male are very numerous, and exhibit great differences as to situation, texture, and uses. Some of them, the testicles, secrete the seminal fluid; others, the vesiculm seminales, hold it: another, the penis, carries it into the organs of the female.

These envelopes consist of five layers or coats, the cu- taneous envelope, the dartos, the tunica erythroides or cremaster muscle, the fibrous coat, and the tunica vaginalis, which, by their superposition, form a kind of bag, divided into two equal portions by an internal septum,* and which bears the name of Scrotum. Attached above to the pelvis, and free in every other direction, this bag is laterally contiguous to the inner and upper part of the thighs ; anteriorly to the penis ; and posteriorly is separated from the anus by an interval of the extent of two or three fingers’ breadth, to which the name of PerincEum is given. It is loose and elongated in weak and old persons, after coition, and during the action of debilitating causes ; drawn up and contracted upon the testicles in strong and vigorous men, and during cold weather. Its right side is generally higher than the left: a circumstance which has not escaped the notice of painters and sculptors. 2893. Cutaneous Envelope of the Testicles. This is merely a prolongation of the skin of the inner part of the thighs, the pe- rinaeum, and penis. It is remarkable for its brown colour, always darker than that of the other parts of the skin, the numerous rugo- sities which it presents, especially when contracted, the great quan- tity of sebaceous follicles which it contains in its substance, and • of the Greeks.

246 ACTIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. CHAPTER SECONl). OF THE MUSCLES IN PARTICULAR. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. I. MUSCLES OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 1. Anterior Vertebral Region. OF THE LONGUS COLLI. (M. Fredm'so-atloidien^ Chauss; M. Longus Colli, Soemm.) 802. The Longus Colli is a flat, narrow, elongated muscle, broader above than below, and in the middle than at the extremi- ties, lying on the anterior lateral part of the bodies of the vertebrÂ®, from the atlas to the third dorsal vertebra inclusive, and formed of two fasciculi which are in a manner superimposed upon each other. One of these is superior, directed obliquely outwards, extended from the anterior tubercle of the atlas, where it takes its origin by aponeurotic fibres, to the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae, at the fore part of which it terminates by small aponeuroses. The other fasciculus is inferior. It de- scends vertically from the body of the axis and that of the third cervical vertebra, and from the anterior tubercle of the fourth or fifth cervical vertebra, whence it rises by aponeuroses, as far as the bo- dies of the last four cervical vertebras and of the three first dorsal, to which it is attached by more or less distinct aponeurotic fibres, which are also inserted into the fibro-cartilages and the base of the transverse processes. 803. Its anterior surface is covered by the rectus capitis anti- cus major, the pharynx, the carotid artery, the pneumo-gastric nerve, and the communicating cords of the cervical gangha and the oesophagus. The posterior surface covers the vertebrm to which it is attached, as well as their fibro-cartilages. Opposite the body of the two first dorsal vertebrae, its outer edge is separated from the scalenus anticus by a triangular interval which lodges the verte- bral artery and vein. Its upper eMremity is confounded with that of the muscle of the opposite side. 804. The aponeuroses, which give origin to this muscle, or

ACTIVE OUGANS OF LOCOMOTION. Â«30 MYOLOGY, ou A DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. CHAPTER FIRST. OF THE ACTIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION, OR OF THE MUSCLES AND THEIR APPENDAGES IN GENERAL, I. Of the Muscles. 776- The Muscles (Musculi)* are organs formed of long pa- rallel fibres commonly of a red or reddish colour, soft, irritable, con- tractile, united into distinct fasciculi, varying in number and size, and themselves composed of subordinate fasciculi. 777* body of man, and of the vertebrate animals in gene- ral, we find two classes of muscles. Some, which are internal, membraniform and hollow, are especially destined for the functions of nutrition and generation; others, which are external, are more or less thick and sohd, and are subservient to what most physiolo- gists call the animal functions. 778. The character by which the muscles of the latter order are essentially distinguished, is the faculty which they possess of con- tracting under the influence of the will, and of thus becoming the efficient cause of most of the motions performed in the animal body (15). They owe this property to the organic element which we have termed Fihnn (8), which constitutes the greater part of their mass, and seems to be prepared beforehand in the blood, where its presence is easily detected, and where it even appears to crystallize under the eye at the moment of coagulation, according to the expression of an eminent modern anatomist; a circumstance that has given rise to the saying, which has much appearance of reason, that blood is liquid fesh. 779- The fibrous tissue which forms the proper part of the or- * Muf from Mvir*.

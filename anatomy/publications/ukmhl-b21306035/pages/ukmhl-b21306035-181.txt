165 OF THE ARTICULATIONS IN GENERAL. Or obscure, called by some authors the planifurtn, or close Diarthrosis, and which others have considered as the true Amphiarthrosis. Ex. Articulation of the hones of the carpus. 2. Or, only permitting limited motions of opposition. This is the Ginglymus,* or alternating or Cardiniform Diaetheosis. It is distinguished into Angular Ginglpmus, or Hinge, of which the motions are commonly reduced to flexion and extension. It is c&WeUi peifeet, if these motions are absolutely the only ones allowed ; Ex. The elbow joint; Or imperfect, if some lateral motions are also permitted. Ex. The knee-joint. Lateral Ginglymus, or Rotatory Diarthrosis, in which rotation is the only possible motion, and which is double, when a bone turns on another by two given points. Ex. The radius on the ulna ; Or simple, if the motion is performed at a single point, Ex. Articulation of the atlas with the odontoid process. JB. Immoveable Articulations or Synarthroses.^ 1. Suture.J The articular surfaces, more or less thick, constantly invest- ed with a cartilaginous plate intimately united to both, receive each other by means of more or less distinct indentations. Sometimes the denticulations which form them have a contracted neck. It is this that constitutes the Dove- tail Suture. Ex. Sagittal Suture. At other times, on the contrary, the circumference of a bone presents but few inequalities, and is sloped to receive the neighbouring bone. This is the Squamous Suture, in which the articular edges of the bones are fitted to each other, like the pieces of a multivalve shell. Ex. The temporal suture. 2. Harmonia.ยง Here the surfaces are only in juxtaposition. They merely present rugosities, which are fitted to each other. Ex. Articulation of the maxillary and nasal bones with each other. 3. Gomphosis.|( The surfaces implanted. Ex. The teeth in their alveoli. 4. Schindylesis.it A plate of a bone is received into a groove of another bone, as is observed between the Ex. Upjjer edge of the vomer, and the lower surface of the sphenoid boner; between the lachrymal bone and the ascending process of the maxillary bone. 558. The aggregate of the means by which the connection of the bones is effected, is what is called Symphysis; ** and as these means vary in the greater number of cases, they being sometimes cartilages, sometimes cartilaginous ligaments, fibrous ligaments, &c. the old anatomists, taking them for the basis of their ^visions, distinguished several kinds of symphyses. Thus the articulations in which cartilages are employed to keep the bones together are * TiyyXv/Mi, cardo. + YiJv, cum; articulus ; coariiculatio. J Sutura, a soatn ยง adapto.

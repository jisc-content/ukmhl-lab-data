8 TO ORGAKIS OF GENERATION. CLASS THIRD. ARTICLE SECOND. ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE FEMALE. 2948. The genital organs of the female form an apparatus at least as complicated as those of the male. Some of them are sub- servient to the act of copulation, such as the vulva, vagina, &c; others, the uterus and its appendages, are the seat of conception, and retain the product during a determinate time ; while others, the mammae, are subservient to the nourishment of the child after birth. I.—OF’ THE VULVA AND ITS APPENDAGES. 2946. The name of vulva or Pudendum is now given to the external parts of generation in the female in general, although this denomination was formerly bestowed solely upon the fissure whicli exists between the labia and which leads to the vagina. The vulva is bounded anteriorly at the fore part of the pubes by a prominent surface covered with hair. This is the Mam Veneris. Posteriorly, it is only separated from the anus by an interval of an inch, to which the name of Perinceum is given. This interval is consequently of much less extent than in the male, and it scarcely presents any trace- of raphe (2893). On its sides are observed two elongated eminences, commencing at the Mons Veneris, and unit- ing posteriorly to form the Fourchette. These eminences are the Labia Pudendi. Between the labia, are observed, superiorly the Clitoris, a small hard and more or less prominent and elongated body ; the Nym~ pirn, a kind of folds which arise from the clitoris and lose them- selves upon the inner surface of the labia; the Vestibule, a triangu- lar space comprised between the upper parts of tlie two nymphm ; the Meatus urinarius or orifice of the urethra, the Entrance of the Vagina, with the Hymen or the CarunculcB myrtiformesand

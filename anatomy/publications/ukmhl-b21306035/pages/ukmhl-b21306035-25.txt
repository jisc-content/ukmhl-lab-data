CLASS FIRST. ARTICLE FIRST. ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. 18. The essential organ of motion is the fleshy or muscular fibre, which, by contracting under the influence of the will, de- termines partial changes of position m the body of animals, or even causes them to remove entirely from the place which they originally occupied. But in order that motions of this kind may be perform- ed with the requisite precision, it is necessary that the muscles should be attached to hard parts, whether within or without the body, which serve as levers, and afford fujcra to each other. Hence the very natural division of the locomotory apparatus into two kinds, the one consisting of the passive organs of locomotion, the other of its active organs. The bones and their appendages be- long to the former, the muscles and the parts connected with them to the latter.* tr^ f Description of the passive organs of locomotion. CHAPTER FIRST. OF THE BONES. ยง Preliminary Remarks. 19. The bones are the hardest, driest, most solid, and most com- pact organs of the body of animals. Having little flexibility, and being incapable of extension, they are easily broken. In general, their colour is an opaque white, reddish externally, and of a more or less deep red internally, when they are fresh. In man, and the animals of the higher orders, they are surrounded by the muscles and teguments, whether they form cavities for the nervous and vascular centres, or constitute the framework of the limbs. They are all internal. They are immediately invested on the outside There are intcnial, involuntary, organic motions, by means of wliieh each of tJie uinctioiis appears to be performed. These Iiuvc no connection with the motions re- ferred to m the present article.

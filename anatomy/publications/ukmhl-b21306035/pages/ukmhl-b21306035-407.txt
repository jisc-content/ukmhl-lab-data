FIRST CLASS. ARTICLE SECOND. ORGANS OF THE VOICE. OF THE LARYNX AND ITS APPENDACIES. GENERAL DISPOSITION. 1401. The larynx* is a rather complex apparatus, formed of several pieces moveable on each other, and which is itself capable of being moved with relation to the surrounding parts. Broader before than behind, and above than below, situated in the middle line of the body, at the upper and fore part of the neck, symmetri- cal and regular, it surmounts the trachea, with whose cavity it com- municates. It is placed below the hyoid bone, opens at its level into the mouth, and is connected with it by ligaments.^ The pha- rynx separates it posteriorly from the vertebral column, and muscles are interposed between it and the skin anteriorly. Cartilages, liga- ments, muscles, glands, membranes, vessels, and nerves enter into the composition of the larynx. This apparatus is manifestly destined to afford a passage to the air for the act of respiration, and to imjiress upon it certain modi- fications which constitute the voice. Its dimensions vary in dif- ferent individuals, and are not always proportional to the stature. It is observed, however, to be always larger and .situated lower in the male than in the female. OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS WHICH ENTER INTO THE COMPOSITION OF THE LARYNX. 1. Of the Cartilages of the Lanjux. OF THE THYROID CARTILAGE.-f* 1402. This is the largest of the cartilages of the larynx, and occupies its anterior and lateral parts. It is of greater extent in the transverse than in the perpendicular direction, and is broader * G'r.

rUKFACE r thereon deductions subversive oi every feeling of respect for that ffreat name wliicli all anatomists have been O tiiught to venerate ? And yet this is true. The trench anatomist affirms Vesalius to have given a representation of the fetus and placenta of a quadruped, knowing it to he Slick, for the human fetus and placenta; which as- sertion is so strangely incorrect, that one is at a loss to explain how it happened to be made by any one ; com- ing, as it does, from the first anatomist of the day, it is inexplicable. To the class of writers who, adopting Winslow as their model, have founded their expectations of public appro- bation on the excellency of their writings, as text books, aiming apparently at no higher merit, belong most of the excellent compilations produced on the Continent since that period ; the writings indeed of Soemmering, Sabar tier, Boyer, Portal, Bichat, Cloquet, and others, leave nOr thing to be desired as mere descriptions of the anatomy of the human body ; and if we deny to them the smalf est title to genius or originality, the praise of clearness of description, admirable general perspicuity, happy arrange- ment, and minute description, cannot possibly' be with- held. In addition to these good qualities, the anatomical writers of whom I now speak pay the greatest attention to method. This stamps an additional value on works of purely descriptive anatomy; but, when carried into surgical anatomy, as has been lately attempted by our Continental neighbours and quondam rivals, it has oc- casionally given rise to the most ridiculous results. (Soon after the introduction of surgical anatomy into Irance (which took place in 1815), the subject of sur- gical anatomy became all at once, like every novelty, a complete mania; and systematic works on surgical ana- tomy were got up with incredible rajiidity. In these works, every region of the.body is deemed of equal siuv

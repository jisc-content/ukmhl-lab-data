. 540 ORGANS OF SENSATION. 1. EXTEnXAL 1 ILAMENTS. 1588. Pretty numerous, and of considerable thickness, but very short, tliesc arise by fasciculi, and go to anastomose with the ante- rior branches of the sacral nerves (1736). Others are distril)utcd to the pyramidalis and levator ani muscles. 2. INTEENAI, FILAMENTS. 1859. Their number is indeterminate ; those of one side anasto- mose with those of the opposite side upon the middle of the sacrum, where they form a kind of plexus. 3. HYPOGASTKIC PLEXUS. 1860. Formed by several filaments of the vesical, uterine, va- ginal, and haemorrhoidal nerves of the sciatic plexus (1763), by the end of the inferior mesenteric (1849) and aortic (1856) plexus, and by a considerable number of the anterior filaments of the sa- cral ganglia, the hypogastric plexus sends its ramifications to the rectum, bladder, vesiculae seminales, uterus, vagina, and anus, along with the arteries which go to be distributed to these parts. More- over, it also sends out of the pelvis, filaments which follow the ar- teries to the posterior .jregion of the thigh. 1861. The last sacral ganglion emits from its inferior part fila- ments which direct themselves inwards to the anterior sacro-coccy- geal ligament (622), where they unite with those of the opposite side, by means of a small ganglion, and forming an arch of which the convexity is directed downwards, and from which proceed some filaments which lose themselves on the anterior surface of the coccyx. IV. OF THE ORGANS OF SENSATION IN PARTICULAR. ARTICLE FIRST. OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES, OR OF THE ORGAN OF VISION 1862. The Eyes, (OcuTi,*) are placed in the orbitar cavities, which we have already described, (342), while their appendages, (ot'uli tutaminn. Hall), occupy the circumference of these fossm, and consist of the eyebrows, eyelids, cilim. Meibomian glands, Sec. â€˜ OipUaXfios of the Greeks.

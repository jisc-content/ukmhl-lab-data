SPERMATIC ARTERIES. 314 The Colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and divides into branches which form arches, and are distributed to the ascending colon. Its descending branches inosculate with the ileo-colica, and the ascending with the colica media. The Colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the su- perior mesenteric, and passes forwards between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, where it forms arches, and is distributed to the transverse colon. It inosculates on the right with the colica dextra ; and on the left with the colica sinistra, a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery. The Spermatic arteries are two small vessels which arise from the front of the aorta below the superior mesenteric ; from this origin each artery passes obliquely outwards, and accompanies the corresponding ureter along the front of the psoas muscle to the border of the pelvis, where it is in relation with the external iliac artery. It is then directed outwards to the internal abdominal ring, and follows the course of tb*3 Fig. I 55.* * The distribution and branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. 1, 1.

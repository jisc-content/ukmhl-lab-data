Gluteus maximus, Gluteus medius, Gluteus minimus, Pyriformis, Gemellus superior, Dissection. â€” The subject being turned on its face, and a block placed beneath the os pubis to support the pelvis, the student commences the dissection of this region, by carrying an incision from the apex of the coccyx along the crest of the ilium to its anterior superior spinous process ; or vice versa, if he be on the left side. He then makes an incision from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, to the apex of the trochanter major, this marks the upper border of the gluteus maximus; and a third incision from the apex of the coccyx along the fleshy margin of the lower border of the gluteus maximus, to the outer side of the thigh, about four inches below the apex of the trochanter major. He then reflects the inte- gument, superficial fascia, and deep fascia, which latter is very thin over this muscle, from the gluteus maximus, following rigidly the course of its fibres; and having exposed the muscle in its entire extent, he dissects the integument and superficial fascia from off the deep fascia which binds down the gluteus medius, the other portion of this region. Obturator internus, Gemellus inferior, Obturator externus, Quadratus femoris.

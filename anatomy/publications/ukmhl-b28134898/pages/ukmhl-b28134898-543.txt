545 FEMALE PELVISâ€”VAGINA. Fig. 241* and its speedy return to its original diameter. The meatus is encircled by a ring of fibrous tissue, which prevents it from distending with the same facility as the rest of the canal; hence it is sometimes advantageous in performing this operation to divide the margin of the meatus slightly with the knife. VAGINA. The Vagina is a membranous canal, leading from the vulva to the uterus, and corresponding in direction with the axis of the outlet of the pelvis. It is constricted at its commencement, but near the uterus becomes dilated; and is closed by the contact of the anterior with the posterior wall. Its length is variable; but it is always longer upon the posterior than upon the anterior wall, the former being usually about five or six inches in length, and the latter four or five. It is attached to the cervix of the uterus, which latter projects into the upper extremity of the canal. In Stmdure the vagina is composed of a mucous lining, a layer of erectile tissue, and an external tunic of contractile fibrous tissue, resembling the dartos of the scrotum.

The External carotid artery ascends nearly perpendicularly from oppo- site the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, to the space between the neck of the lower jaw and the meatus auditorius, where it divides into the temporal and internal maxillary artery. Relations. â€” In front it is crossed by the posterior belly of the digas- tricus, stylo-hyoideus, and platysma myoides muscles; by the hypoglossal nerve near its origin; higher up it is situated in the substance of the parotid gland, and is crossed by the facial nerve. Behind, it is separated from the internal carotid by the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscles, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland.

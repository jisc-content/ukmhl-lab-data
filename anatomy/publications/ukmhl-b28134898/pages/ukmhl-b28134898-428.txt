430 POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE. formed by the two bellies of that muscle; at a variable distance below the articulation of the knee it receives a large branch, the communicans peronei, from the peroneal nerve, and the two together constitute the ex- ternal saphenous nerve. The External saphenous nerve pierces the deep fascia below the fleshy part of the gastrocnemius muscle, and continues its course down the leg, lying along the outer border of the tendo Achillis and by the side of the external saphenous vein, which it accompanies to the foot. At the lower part of the leg it winds around the outer malleolus, and is distributed to the outer side of the foot and little toe, communicating with the external peroneal cutaneous nerve, and sending numerous filaments to the integu ment of the heel and sole of the foot. Fig. 192* Fig. I93.f The Posterior Tibial Nerve is continued along the posterior aspect of the leg from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the posterior part of the inner ankle, where it divides into the internal and external plantar nerve.

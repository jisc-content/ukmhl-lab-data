' FEMALE PELVIS. The peculiarities in form of the female pelvis have already been ex- amined with the anatomy of the bones (p. 118). Its lining boundaries are the same with those of the male. The contents are, the bladder, vagina, uterus with its appendages, and the rectum. Some portion of the small intestines also occupies the upper part of its cavity. The Bladder is in relation with the ossa pubis in front, with the uterus behind, from which it is usually separated by a convolution of small in- testine, and with the neck of the uterus and vagina beneath. The form of the female bladder corresponds with that of the pelvis, being broad from side to side, and often bulging more on one side than on the other. This is narticularly evident after frequent parturition. The coats of the bladde; are the same as those of the male. The Urethra is about an inch and a half in length, and is lodged in the upper wall of the vagina, in its course downwards and forwards, beneath the aich of the os pubis, to the meatus urinarius. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is disposed in longitudinal folds, and is continuous in ternally with that of the bladder, and externally with that of the vulva, the mucous membrane is surrounded by a proper coat of elastic tissue, to which the muscular fibres of the detrusor urinae are attached. It is to the elastic tissue that is due the remarkable dilatability of the female urethra, * Human testis injected with mercury. 1, 1. Lobules formed of seminiferous tubes 2.

ULNAR ARTERY—BRANCHES. 307 and in the palm it rests upon the tendons of the flexor sublimis, being covered in by the palmaris brevis muscle and palmar fascia. It is accom- panied in its course by the venae comites, and is in relation with the ulnar nerve for the lower two-thirds of its extent. Plan of the Relations of the Ulnar Artery. In Front. Deep fascia, Superficial layer of muscles, Median nerve. In the Hand. Tendinous arch from the pisiform bone, Palmaris brevis muscle, Palmar fascia. Inner Side. Flexor carpi ulnaris, Ulnar nerve (lower two-thirds). Ulnar artery. Behind. Brachialis anticus, Flexor profundus digitorum, Pronator quadratus. Outer Side. Flexor sublimis digi- torum. In the Hand. Annular ligament, Tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum. The Branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged, like those of the radial, into three groups :— Fore-arm, Wrist, Hand, Anterior ulnar recurrent, Posterior ulnar recurrent, Interosseous, $ Anterior interosseous, l Posterior interosseous. Muscular. ( Carpalis anterior, ( Carpalis posterior. Digitales. The Anterior ulnar recurrent arises immediately below the elbow, and ascends in front of the joint between the pronator radii teres and brachialis anticus, where it inosculates with the anastomotica magna and inferior profunda. The two recurrent arteries frequently arise by a common trunk. The Posterior ulnar recurrent, larger than the preceding, arises imme- diately below the elbow joint, and passes backwards beneath the origins of the superficial layer of muscles; it then ascends between the two headis of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and beneath the ulnar nerve, and inosculates with the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna. The Common interosseous artery is a short trunk which arises from the ulnar, opposite the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. It divides into two branches, the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries.

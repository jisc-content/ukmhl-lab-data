(xi) TO THE FOURTH AMERICAN EDITION. The Editor, in presenting this new edition of Mr. Wilson’s standard work on Anatomy, has found but little to add, the author having so com pletely revised and brought up his last edition ; while he has incorporated in the text many of the Editor’s notes to former editions. A small increase in the size of the page has enabled the Publishers to take in the additional matter, while diminishing slightly the number of pages. The Editor has added some new matter and a large number of new cuts— among others an important series on the nerves—he has rewritten his in- troductory chapter on Histology; and he has taken every care to ensure, throughout, perfect correctness in the text. He thus hopes that the work will continue to hold the high character which its merits have acquired in this country, and to maintain its position as a standard Text Book for the student, which it has assumed in so many of our Colleges. The London edition is still known by the Author’s original title of “Vade Mecum;” but the publishers consider themselves sustained in the change they have made, by the fulness and completeness of the work, which amply warrant for it the title of “A System of Human Anatomy.” P. B. G. Philadelphia, July, 1848.

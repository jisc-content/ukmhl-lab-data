510 MUCOUS COAT. vascular at the great extremity, and becomes thicker and lighter in cclour towards the pyloric extremity. It is formed into plaits or rugce, which are disposed for the most part in a longitudinal direction. The rugse are most numerous towards the lesser end of the stomach; while around the cardiac orifice they assume a . radiated arrangement. At the pylorus the mucous membrane forms a circular or spiral fold which constitutes a part of the apparatus of the pyloric valve. In the lower half of the duodenum, the whole length of the jejunum, and the upper part of the ileum, it forms valvular folds called valvulce conniventes, which are several lines in breadth in the lower part of the duodenum and upper portion of the jejunum, and diminish gradually in size towards each extremity. These folds do not entirely surround the cylinder of the intestine, but extend for about one- half or three-fourths of its circumference. In the lower half of the ileum the mucous lining is without folds; hence the thinness of the coats of this Fig. 223 * intestine as compared with the jejunum and duodenum. At the termina- tion of the ileum in the caecum, the mucous membrane forms two folds, which are strengthened by the muscular coat, and project into the caecum. These are the ileo-azcal valve (valvula Bauhini). In the caecum and colon the mucous membrane is raised into crescentic folds, which correspond s A vertical section of the anterior parietes of the anus, with the whole canal dis- played so as to show the relations of the sacculi of the middle region, and their relations to the surrounding parts, their orifices being marked with bristles. 1, 1.

POSTERIOR TIBIAE AND PERONEAL ARTERIES. 331 border of the popliteus muscle to the concavity of the os calcis, where it divides into the internal and external plantar artery. Relations.—In its course downwards it lies first upon the tibialis posti- cus, next on the flexor longus digitorum, and then on the tibia ; it is covered in by the intermuscular fascia which separates it above trom the soleus, and below from the deep fascia of the leg and the integument. It is accompanied by its vense comites, and by the posterior tibial nerve, which latter lies at first to its outer side, then superficially to it, and again to its outer side.

Branches.—The branches of the posterior tibial artery are the— Peroneal, Nutritious, Muscular, Internal calcanean, Internal plantar, External plantar. The Peroneal artery is given off from the posterior tibial at about two inches below the lower border of the popliteus muscle; it is nearly as large as the anterior tibial artery, and passes obliquely outwards to the fibula. It then runs downwards along the inner border of the fibula to its lower third, where it divides into the anterior and posterior peroneal artery. Relations.—The peroneal artery rests upon the tibialis posticus muscle, and is covered in by the soleus, the intermuscular fascia, and the flexor ongus pollicis, having the fibula to its outer side.

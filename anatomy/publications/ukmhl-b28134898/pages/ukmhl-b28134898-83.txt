85 LATERAL REGION OF THE SKULL Upon the inner or cerebral surface of this region is a shallow groove, extending* along* the middle line from before backwards, for the superior o o Fig. 39 * Fig- 40 t longitudinal sinus; on either side of this groove are several small fossa* for the Pacchionian bodies, and further outwards, digital fossae correspond- ing with the convexities of the convolutions, and numerous ramified mark- ings for lodging the branches of the arteria meningea media. The lateral region of the skull is divisible into three portions; tem- poral, mastoid, and zygomatic. The temporal portion, or temporal fossa, is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, in front by the external angular process of the * A front view of the skull. 1. The frontal portion of the frontal bone. The 2, im- mediately over the root of the nose, refers to the nasal tuberosity; the 3, over the orbit, to the supra-orbital ridge. 4. The optic foramen. 5. The sphenoidal fissure. 6. The spheno-maxillary fissure. 7. The lachrymal fossa in the lachrymal bone, the com- mencement of the nasal duct. The figures 4, 5, 6, 7, are within the orbit. 8. The opening of the anterior nares, divided into two parts by the vomer; the number is placed upon the latter. 9. The infra-orbital foramen. 10. The malar bone. 11. The symphisis of the lower jaw. 12.

259 PLANTAR REGION. The Dorsal Interossei muscles are placed between the metatarsal Dones; they resemble the analogous muscles in the hand in arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones ; their tendons are inserted into the base of the first phalanx, and into the digital expan- sion of the tendons of the long extensor. The first dorsal interosseous is inserted into the inner side of the second toe, and is therefore an adductor; the other three are inserted into the outer side of the second, third, and fourth toes, and are consequently abductors. Relations. — By their upper surface with a strong fascia which separates them from the extensor tendons. By their under surface with the plantar interossei. Each of the muscles gives passage to a small artery (posterior perforating) which communicates with the external plantar artery. And between the heads of the first interosseous muscle the communicating artery of the dorsalis pedis takes its course. Plantar Region. First Layer. Abductor pollicis, Abductor minimi digiti, Flexor brevis digitorum. Dissection.—The sole of the foot is best dissected by carrying an inci- sion around the heel, and along the inner and outer borders of the foot, to * Dorsal interossei. 1. Abductor secundi. 2.

On the second and third toes, the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum are seen passing through the bifurcation of the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum.

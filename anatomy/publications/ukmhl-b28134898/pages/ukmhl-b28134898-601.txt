No other work that we have seen presents the reader with so wide a range of ele- mentary knowledge, with so full illustrations, at so cheap a rate.—Silliman's Journal, Nov. 1853. TAYLOR (ALFRED S.), M. D., F. R. S., Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence and Chemistry in Guy’s Hospital. Third American, from the fourth and improved With Notes and References to American Decisions, by Edward Hartshorne. volume, of about seven hundred pages. (Just Issued.) MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. English Edition. M. D. In one large octavo We know of no work on Medical Jurisprudence which contains in the same space anything like the same amount of valuable matter.—N. Y. Journal of Medicine. The American editor has appended several im- portant facts, the whole constituting by far the best, most reliable, and interesting treatise on Medical Jurisprudence, and one that we cannot too strongly recommend to all who desire to become acquainted with the true and correct exposition of this depart- ment of medical literature.—Northern Lancet. No work upon the subject can be put into the hands of students either of law or medicine which will engage them more closely or profitably ; and none could be otTered to the busy practitioner of either calling, for the purpose of casual or hasty I reference, that would be more likely toafTord the aid desired. We therefore recommend it as the best and safest manual for daily use.—American Journal of Medical Sciences. We have heretofore had reason to refer to it in terms of commendation, and need now only state that, in the edition before us, the author has com- pletely revised the whole work, making many addi- tions and alterations, and brought it fully up to the present state of knowledge. The task of the Ameri- can editor has been to present all the important facts and cases that have recently occurred in our own country, hearing on the subjects treated of. No better work can be placed in the hands of the physician or jurist.—St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal. BY THE SAME AUTHOR. ON POISONS, IN RELATION TO MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AND MEDICINE. Edited, with Notes and Additions, by R. E. Griffith, M. D. In one large octavo volume, of 688 pages. The most elaborate work on the subject that our literature possesses.—British and Foreign Medico- Chirurgical Review. It contains a vast body of facts, which embrace all that is important in toxicology, all that is necessary to the guidance of the medical jurist, and all that can be desired by the lawyer. — Medico- Chirurgical Review. One of the most practical and trustworthy works on Poisons in our language.—Western Journal of Medicine. It is, so far as our knowledge extends, incompa- rably the best upon the subject; in the highest de- gree creditable to the author, entirely trustworthy, and indispensable to the student and practitioner.— N. Y. Annalist THOMSON (A. T.), M. D., F. R. S., &c. DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT OF THE SICK ROOM, necessary in aid of Medical Treatment for the Cure of Di-eases. Edited by II. E. Griffith, M. D.

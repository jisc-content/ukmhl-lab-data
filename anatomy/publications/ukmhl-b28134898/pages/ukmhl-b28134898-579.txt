AND SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS. 5 BARTLETT (ELISHA), M. D., Professor of Materia Medica and Medical Jurisprudence in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York. TIIE HISTORY, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT OP TIIE FEVERS OF THE UNITED STATES. Third edition, revised and improved. In one octavo volume, of six hundred pages, beautifully printed, and strongly bound. In preparing a new edition of this standard work, the author has availed himself of such obser- vations and investigations as have appeared since the publication of his last revision, and he has endeavored in every way to render it worthy of a continuance of the very marked favor with which it has been hitherto received. The masterly and elegant treatise, by Dr. Bartlett is invaluable to the American student and practi- tioner.—Dr. Holmes's Report to the Nat. Med. Asso- ciation. We regard it, from the examination we have made of it, the best work on fevers extant in our language, and as such cordially recommend it to the medical public.—St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal. Take it altogether, it is the most complete history of our fevers which has yet been published, and every practitioner should avail himself of its con- tents.— The Western Lancet. Of the value and importance of such a work, it is needless here to speak ; the profession of the United States owe much to the author for the very able volume which he has presented to them, and for the careful and judicious manner in which he has exe- cuted his task. No one volume with which we are acquainted contains so complete a history of our fevers as this. To Dr. Bartlett we owe our best thanks for the very able volume he has given us, as embodying certainly the most complete, methodical, and satisfactory account of our fevers anywhere to be met with.— The Charleston Med. Journal and Review. BUCKLER (T. H.), M. D., Formerly Physician to the Baltimore Almshouse Infirmary, &c. ON THE ETIOLOGY, PATHOLOGY, AND TREATMENT OP PIIIRO- BRONCHITIS AND RHEUMATIC PNEUMONIA.

In one large volume, octavo, with numerous wood-cuts. pp. 720. The treatise of M. Colombat is a learned and la- borious commentary on these diseases, indicating very considerable research, great accuracy of judg- ment, and no inconsiderable personal experience. With the copious notes and additions of its experi- enced and very erudite translator and editor, Dr. Meigs, it presents, probably, one of the most com- plete and comprehensive works on the subject we possess.—American Med. Journal. M. Colombat De L’Isere has not consecrated ten years of studious toil and research to the frailer sex in vain; and although we regret to hear it is at the expense of health, he has imposed a debt of gratitude as well upon the profession, as upon the mothers and daughters of beautiful* France, which that gallant nation knows best how to acknowledge.—New Or- leans Medical Journal.

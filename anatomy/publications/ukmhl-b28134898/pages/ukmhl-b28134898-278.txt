280 ABDOMINAL AORTA. The Thoracic aorta is situated to the left side of the vertebral column, but approaches the middle line as it descends, and at the aortic opening of the diaphragm is altogether in front of the column. After entering the abdomen it again falls back to the left side. Relations.—It is in relation, behind, with the vertebral column and lesser vena azygos ; in front, with the oesophagus and right pneumogastric nerve ; to the left side, with the pleura; and to the right, with the thoracic duct.

Lesser vena azygos, Vertebral column. The Abdominal aorta enters the abdomen through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and descends, lying rather to the left side of the verte- bral column, to the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the two common iliac arteries. Relations.—It is crossed in front, by the left renal vein, pancreas, trans- verse duodenum, and mesentery, and is embraced by the aortic plexus; behind it is in relation with the thoracic duct, receptaculum chyli, and left lumbar veins. On its left side is the left semilunar ganglion and sympathetic nerve; and on the right, the vena cava, right semilunar ganglion, and the com- mencement of the vena azygos.

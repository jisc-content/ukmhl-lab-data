313 SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. tributed to the small intestine from the duodenum to the termination of the ileum. In their course between the layers ot the mesentery, they foim a series of arches by the inosculation of their larger branches; from these Fig. 154.* are developed secondary arches, and from the latter a third series of arches, from which the branches arise which are distributed to the coats of the in- testine. From the middle branches a fourth and sometimes even a fifth series of arches is produced. By means of these arches a direct commu- nication is established between all the branches given off from the convex- ity of the superior mesenteric artery; the superior branches moreover sup- ply the pancreas and duodenum, and inosculate wdth the pancreatico- duodenalis ; and the inferior with the ileo-colica. The lleo-colic artery is the last branch given off from the concavity of the superior mesenteric. It descends to the right iliac fossa, and divides into branches wThich communicate and form arches, from which branches are distributed to the termination of the ileum, the caecum, and the com- mencement of the colon. This artery inosculates on the one hand with the last branches of the vasa intestini tenuis, and on the other with the last colica dextra. * The course and distribution of the superior mesenteric artery. 1.

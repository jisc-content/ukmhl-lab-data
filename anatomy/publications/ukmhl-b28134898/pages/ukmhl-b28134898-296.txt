Â£96 SUPRA-SCAPULAR ARTERY. remarkable communication at the base of the brain is formed by the ante- rior communicating branch, anterior cerebrals, and internal carotid arteries, Fig. 149* in front, and by the posterior communicating, posterior cerebrals, and basilar artery, behind. The Thyroid axis is a short trunk, which divides almost immediately after its origin into four branches, some of which are occasionally branches of the subclavian artery itself. The Inferior thyroid artery ascends obliquely in a serpentine course behind the sheath of the carotid vessels, to the inferior part of the thyroid gland, to which it is distributed; it sends branches also to the trachea, lower part of the larynx, and oesophagus. It is in relation with the middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, which lies in front of it. The Supra-scapular artery (transversalis humeri) passes obliquely outwards behind the clavicle, and over the ligament of the supra-scapular notch, to the supra-spinatus fossa. It crosses in its course the scalenus anticus muscle, phrenic nerve, and subclavian artery, is distributed to the * The circle of Willis. The arteries have references only on one side, on account of their symmetrical distribution. 1. The vertebral arteries. 2. The two anterior spinal branches uniting to form a single vessel. 3.

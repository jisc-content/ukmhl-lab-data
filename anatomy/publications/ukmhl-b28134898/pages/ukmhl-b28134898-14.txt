PREFACE. Vlll to request a continuance of those communications from scientific investi- gators, which have hitherto so materially aided him. The woodcut illustrations which accompany the Anatomist’s Vade Mecum have been increased with each edition. Several of the new figures are illustrative of General Anatomy, and, to insure their absolute correctness, have been drawn from the microscope by the Author himself, with the aid of the camera lucida. Figures 13, 14, 15, showing the changes which occur during the development of bone; figures 63—66, the minute anatomy of cartilage; and figure 103, the structure of the ultimate muscular fibril, are examples of such drawings. The structure exhibited m the latter figure formed the subject of a paper which was read before the Royal Society during the present year. Upper Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, November, 1844.

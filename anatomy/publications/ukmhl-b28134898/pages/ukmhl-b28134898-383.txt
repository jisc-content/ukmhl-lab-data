385 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Sylvius. In their interior they contain grey matter, which has a semilunar shape when the crus is divided transversely, and has been termed the locui junker. The third nerve will be observed to arise from the inner side of each, and the fourth nerves wind around their outer border from above. The Pons Varolii* (protuberantia annularis, nodus encephali), is the broad transverse band of white fibres which arches like abridge across the upper part of the medulla oblongata ; and, contracting on each side into a thick rounded cord, enters the substance of the cerebellum under the name of crus cerebelli. There is a groove along its middle which lodges the basilar artery. The pons Varolii is the commissure of the cerebellum, and associates the two lateral lobes in their common function. Resting against the pons, near its posterior border, is the sixth pair of nerves. On the anterior border of the crus cerebelli, at each side, is the thick bundle of filaments belongingto the fifth nerve, and, lying against its posterior border, the seventh pair of nerves. The upper surface of the pons forms a part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata (bulbus rhachidicus), is the upper enlarged por- tion of the spinal cord. It is somewhat conical in shape, and a little more than an inch in length, extending from the pons Varolii to a point corre- sponding with the upper border of the atlas. On the middle line, in front and behind, the medulla oblongata is marked by two vertical fissures, the fissura longitudinalis anterior and posterior, which divide it superficially into two symmetrical lateral cords or columns; whilst each lateral column is subdivided by minor grooves into three smaller cords, namely, the cor- pora pyramidalia, corpora olivaria, and corpora restiformia. The Corpora pyramidalia are two narrow convex cords, tapering slightly from above downwards, and situated one on either side of the fissura lon- gitudinalis anterior. At about an inch below the pons the corpora pyra- midalia communicate very freely across the fissure by a decussation of their fibres, and at their point of entrance into the pons they are constricted into round cords. The fissura longitudinalis is somewhat enlarged by'this constriction, and the enlarged space has received the name of foramen caecum of the medulla oblongata. The Corpora olivaria (named from some resemblance to the shape of an olive), are two oblong, oval-shaped, convex bodies, of about the same breadth with the corpora pyramidalia, about half an inch in length, and tuber cinereum, from which the infundibulum is seen projecting. 12. The corpora al- bicantia. 13. The locus perforatus, bounded on each side by the crura cerebri, and by the third nerve. 14. The pons Varolii. 15. The crus cerebelli of one side. 16. The fifth nerve emerging from the anterior border of the crus cerebelli; the small nerve by its side is the fourth. 17. The sixth pair of nerves. 18. The seventh pair of nerves con- sisting of the auditory and facial. 19. The corpora pyramidalia of the medulla oblongata; the corpus olivare and part of the corpus restiforme are seen at each side. Just below the numeral is the decussation of the fibres of the corpora pyramidalia. 20. The eighth pair of nerves. 21. The ninth or hypoglossal nerve. 22. The anterior root of the first cervical spinal nerve. * Constant Varolius, Professor of Anatomy in Bologna: died in 1578. He dissected the brain in the course of its fibres, beginning from the medulla oblongata ; a plan which has since been perfected by Vieussens, and by Gall and Spurzheim. The work con lairiing his mode of dissection, <( De Resolutione Corporis Humani,” was published after his death, in 1591. 33 z

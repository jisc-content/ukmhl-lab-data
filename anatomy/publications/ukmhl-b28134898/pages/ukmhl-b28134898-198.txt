MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 200 latter origin takes place by muscular slips, which indigitate with the ex- ternal oblique muscle of the abdomen. The fibres from this extensive Fig. ] 14.* origin converge as they ascend, and cross the inferior angle of the scapula; they then curve around the lower border of the teres major muscle, and terminate in a short quadrilateral tendon,f which lies in front of the tendon of the teres, and is inserted into the bicipital groove. A synovial bursa is interposed between the muscle and the lower angle of the scapula, and * The first and second and part of the third layer of muscles of the back ; the first layer being shown upon the right, and the second on the left side. 1. The trapezius muscle. 2. The tendinous portion which, with a corresponding portion in the opposite muscle, forms the tendinous ellipse on the back of the neck. 3. The acromion process and spine of the scapula. 4. The latissimus dorsi muscle. 5. The deltoid. 6. The muscles of the dorsum of the scapula, infra-spinatus, teres minor, and teres major. 7. The external oblique muscle. 8. The gluteus medius. 9. The glutei maximi. 10. The levator anguli scapulae. 11. The rhomboideus minor. 12. The rhomboideus major. 13. The splenius capitis; the muscle immediately above, and overlaid by the splemus, is the complexus. 14. The splenius colli, only partially seen; the common origin of the splenius is seen attached to the spinous processes below the lower border of the rhom- boideus major. 15. The vertebral aponeurosis. 16. The serratus posticus inferior. 17. The supra-spinatus muscle. 18. The infra-spinatus. 19. The teres minor muscle. 20. The teres major. 21. The long head of the triceps, passing between the teres minor and major to the upper arm. 22. The serratus magnus, proceeding forwards from its origin at the base of the scapula. 23. The internal oblique muscle. {-A small muscular fasciculus from the pectoralis major is sometimes found connected with <his tendon.

284 SUPERIOR THYROID ARTERY. Branches.—The branches of the external carotid are eleven in number, and may be arranged into four groups, viz. Anterior. 1. Superior thyroid, 2. Lingual, 3. Facial. Posterior. 4. Mastoid, 5. Occipital, 6. Posterior auricular. Superior. 7. Ascending pharyngeal, 8. Parotidean, 9. Transverse facial. Terminal. 10. Temporal, 11. Internal maxillary. The anterior branches arise from the commencement of the external carotid, within a short distance of each other. The lingual and facial bifurcate, not unfrequently, from a common trunk. 1. The Superior thyroid artery (the first of the branches of the ex- ternal carotid) curves downwards to the thyroid gland to which it is dis- tributed, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the inferior thyroid arteries. In its course it passes beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and sterno-hyoid muscles.

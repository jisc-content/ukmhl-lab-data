DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. 47 of the shaft in a long, or the mid-point of a flat bone, and here the punctum ossificationis, or centre oi ossification, is established. What determines the vascular concentration now alluded to, is a question not easily solved, hut that it takes place is certain, and the vascular punctum is the most easily demonstrable of all the phenomena of ossification. During the formation of the punctum ossificationis, changes begin to be appa- rent in the cartilage cells. Originally they are simple nucleated cells (scfeo t0 Fig. 13.* 1 of an inch in diame- <$> % * % 09 I <*0 $ q © ® § r\ ^ GO) a ® ° <g<S> ®!b ^ ® <** 6 % VS 1 \ ■£,*§>« ij, s « ^ V'fWi si 51)0 0 ter), having a rounded form. As growth pro- ceeds, they become elon- gated in their figure, and it is then perceived that" each cell contains two and often three nucleoli, around which smaller cells are in progress of formation. ^ If we examine them nearer to the punctum ossificationis, we find that the young or secondary cells have each attained the size of the pa- rent cell (ooVo an inch), the membrane of the parent cell has disappeared, and the young cells are separated to a short distance by freshly effused intercellular substance, a more remarkable change has ensued, the energy of cellule reproduction has augmented with proximity to the os- sifying point, and each cell in place of M producing two, gives birth to four, five, or six young cells, which rapidly de- $ 09 .0 03, ,, up uw ^ v y® <2% Nearer still to the punctum ossificationis 15.* Fig. * Figures illustrative of the development of bone; they are magnified 155 times, and drawn with the camera lucida. a.

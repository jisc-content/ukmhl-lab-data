42 HISTOLOGY. 2d. Cells may elongate so as to form tubes or solid rods ; in the former case they adhere by their ends to neighbouring cells, and their cavities mutually open into each other, thus forming a vessel: in the latter the F> fluid content is lost, and a rod or lg* ' fibre is the result. Curious forms are produced by a modification of the same law, as exemplified in fig. 5. 3d. Solid deposits may occur within the cell wall, obliterating its cavity. 4th. The same thing may occu. in the blastema, exterior to the cell walls, and thus a solid will result. Examples of the third and fourth kind occur in the formation of cartilage, as is illustrated in the accompa- nying cuts. Fig. 6.f Fig. 7.f Fig. 8.j- Fig. 9.* 10.§ 5th. A curious modification of development occurs in the feathers of birds, where a nucleated cell elongates and becomes filled with fibres; the «cell wall is rubbed off by attrition, and the fibres are thus uncovered and exposed. See fig. 10, a. 6, c. Finally, it is believed by some that the blastema may form a simple membrane or fibre without the intervention of a cell, although this is by no means proved. » Curious forms of cell transformation usually found in abnormal deposits, j- Development of cartilage. $ Deposit in layers of lignin in the interior of vegetable cells. § Mode of formation of the feathers of a bird in the interior of a nucleated cell.

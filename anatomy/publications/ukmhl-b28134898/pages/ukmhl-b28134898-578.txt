The reputation which this work has obtained as a full and practical treatise on an important class of diseases will not be diminished by this improved and enlarged edition. It has been carefully and thoroughly revised by the author; the number of plates has been increased, and the style of its me- chanical execution will be found materially improved. The full digest we have given of the new matter introduced into the present volume, is evidence of the value we place on it. The fact that the profes- sion has required a second edition of a monograph such as that before us, bears honorable testimony to its usefulness. For many years, Dr. JBudd’s work must be the authority of the great mass of British practitioners on the hepatic diseases ; and it is satisfactory that the subject has been taken up by so able and experienced a physician.—British and.

The new edition of Dr. Bird’s work, though not increased in size, has been greatly modified, and much of it rewritten. It now presents, in a com- pendious form, the gist of all that is known and re- liable in this department. From its terse style, and convenient size, it is particularly applicable to the student, to whom we cordially commend it.— The Medical Examiner.

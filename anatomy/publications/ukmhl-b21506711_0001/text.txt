MARTIN’S. 1 8 5 8.MEDICAL STUDENTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AEE THESE “ ANATOMICAL EXAMINATIONS” MOST SINCEEELT AND EESPECTFULLY INSCEIBED BY THE AUTHOR.PREFACE. Amid a multiplicity of toils and responsibilities which invariably accompany the duties demanded of the General Practitioner, the Author, as such, has nevertheless appropriated every available •oiroortunity in preparing and completing a System of Human Anatomy, comprising in Two Volumes a series of Ten Thousand Five Hundred Questions and Ansicers for the use of those Gentle- men who are, and those who intend hereafter, pursuing their Medical and Surgical Studies in accordance with the Curricula reouired of them by the various Examining Boards. In the fulfilment of this task the Author’s chief aim has been to avail himself of all aids within his reach, which the importance of the subject so essentially claims. As Osteology forms the basis of, and the prelude to, the Student’s general acquaintance with Anatomy, he is earnestly solicited to embrace this Department of the Science with that unceasing assiduity which is essential to his subsequent labours. ■r From the Title accorded to these Volumes the Student must not expect to meet with speculative ideas, whereby his mind may be gratified with phenomena in unexplored regions, but will have revealed to him those which Nature presents, as evidenced by ♦ that Supreme Being, whose nobig work, the creation of man, he must ever regard as an unutterably sublime display of the Great Creator’s power. In conclusion the Author indulges the hope, that as a work of reference, these Volumes may neither prove uninteresting nor un instructive to the General Practitioner. 10, Steep-hill, Lincoln, December 14 th, 1858.QUESTIONS , ‘j i /» ON HUMAN ANATOMY.

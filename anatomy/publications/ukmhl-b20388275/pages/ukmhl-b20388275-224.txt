220 THE MAKING OF THE BODY of the face have to do with the nose, but also their names and some of their uses. It is a wonderful place this house of smell, with ex- quisite rooms and all sorts of marvellous contrivances. In it are the scroll-like bones {irife'rior furhinated)^ which, twisting in and out, make many rooms. It is the nose bones {nasal), which form the outer walls of the chambers, while their roof is made of our old friend the sieve-like bone [ttiLnnjid)^ and in the Hoor we find another acquaintance, no less a one than the bone that formed the roof of the mouth [palate hone). The little tear troughs {lacltriinial) run down the sides of tliis home of smell, and the ploughshare bone {vomer) divides the wall passage exactly in half. Each passage is called A Nostril. And now, in imagination, we will follow an odottr in the air until yoti know that yoti smell a smell. First, the tiny particles approach the door of the passage and enter by one of the nostrils. It finds it lined with tiny hairs, which, like those in the hearing passage {^Auditory t'Linah. serve as a sort of screen to keep files and dust otit, or to prevent them going farther up the nose into the delicate chambers that lie farther back. These are the guards. If the incomer is an intrtider, they bend forward and resist its entrance : but if it is only a smell, they stand still and allow the tiny particle or invisible gas to go on itndisturbed. On it travels throtigh a little room, rotmd a corner, down a passage, tintil it reaches the chamber made by one of the scroll-like bones {'iiuddde tiii'hi'iiattd). Up to now the odottr had travelled with the rest of the air which naturally went into the nose on its way to the lung, but now it leaves the rest of the air, continties its path, and goes otit mto the throat chamber {pltarynx) by the two openings which are called The Back Doors {Posterior Xares).

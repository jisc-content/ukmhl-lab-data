REFLEX ACTION 87 remember that the little sleep may make mother's head- ache well, and so your will comes in and commands your motor nerves not to move. Again and again goes the order down the spinal cord and through the front nerves {ant€rior)y that the body is not to move, and the laugh to be stifled. If the will has been practised often enough it will conquer, in spite of the grey matter in the spinal cord being ready, without any brain orders, to send back quite different instructions. This is a little instance, but as you go on through life you will find many opportunities of seeing how the will should and can conquer what we call our natural feelings; but you must practise it when you are young, or it will not be strong enough to do all it should do when you arc older. The will, like the muscles, grows by use. " Disuse is death." CHAPTER XXI. THE yoURNEY OF THE SENSATIONS. REFLEX ACTION. Reflex action—what does that mean 1 Well, you learnt something about it in the last chapter, though not by the name of reflex action. Shortly, we mean by reflex action those actions that take place without the aid of the will or consciousness, Avhich have their only home in the brain. They are the actions about which the grey matter manages to receive information, and to give orders with- out further instruction from anywhere. They are the actions which are done, as it were, by the little nerve centres, without the knowledge, and un- controlled by the will, which dwells only in the brain in the head. The grey matter which manages reflex action is not al- ways in the spinal cord. If somebody's hand was suddenly held up as if to throw something at you, you would instinctively close your eyes. "Instinctively," I say.

When the food enters the stomach it is not allowed any time to rest, for directly it is within the bag the work begins that is to turn the meat, and bread and butter, and potatoes into something else.

When the food enters the stomach each and all of these muscles begin to work. The A muscles shorten and lengthen, and as they do so they throw the food from the broad to the narrow end of the stomach or in the picture from the right-hand side to the left-hand side. The B muscles shorten and lengthen, and by their

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 154 In the nose the air is both filtered and warmed. It is filtered by the little hairs which are inside the nostril, and by some wool-like threads which stick out and catch hold of the dirt in the air, and do their best to keep it from going any further. Thus people who breathe through their mouths run a greater risk of getting dirty things into their lungs than those who breathe through their noses and make use of the filter which has been wisely placed there for this purpose. Besides being filtered, the air is also warmed as it goes through the nose. All around its bony plate blood-vessels are placed; through them the warm blood travels, and by their aid the passage gets some of the warmth of the life blood, and so becomes nearer the same heat at which the lungs are constantly kept. It is even more important to breathe through the nose in winter than it is in the summer, because the lungs, being delicate, are apt to take cold. After the air has passed through the nose, it enters the big chamber of the throat {plianjnx). There are, as you know, five doorways to conduct things in or out of that chamber. 1. From the Ear {Eustaclimn Tube). 2. From the Nose {Nasal Passage), 3. Into the Lungs {Larynx). 4. From the Mouth. 5. To the Stomach {Gv.llet Oesophagus). The air has come in by the nose passage. Through which one is it to continue its travels ? If the air went into the stomach it would be wasted. ISTeither the ear nor the mouth wants it: it is needed by the lungs, and has to find its way into them. The road it has to take is by The Windpipe (2?w/iea). Here are two pictures of it. One will show you

42 THE MAKING OF THE BODY CHAPTER IX. THE MUSCLES. Here is a piece of elastic. Muscles are like it in three ways— I. Muscles can become longer, or expand. II. Muscles can become shorter, or contract. III. Muscles can remain as they are, or be stationary. All over the body there are muscles ; they have differ- ent objects and different work to do; they are of different shapes and sizes. There are a great many, nearly five hundred, but broadly they are divided into two sorts — 1. The willing muscles [ ix>luntarij striped) obey our will. 2. The wilful muscles {inwluniary smooth) act with- out our knowledge or control. Every one has seen the muscles of animals; indeed, the lean of meat is nearly all composed of muscles. But we have yet to learn of what muscle is made. If we removed the two skins, the upper skin (ejjidermis) and the true skin {dermis), from any one of you— skinned you, in short—we should find under the skin the flesh which is made of muscles. Did you ever see a bit of the coarse part of the leg of beef boiled for such a long time that it is what people call stringy ? Xow, if you took one of these bits of stringy meat and boiled it again it would separate into still smaller strings, and a little patient working with a needle-point and a magnifying-glass would divide it into even finer threads. The thinnest of these three sorts of threads is called fihrillce. A number of these lying side by side make a jihre. A bundle of fibres makes 2^ fasciculus, A number of these fasciculus (called fasciculi) make a muscle. 1. The finest threads [filrillce). 2. A number of the finest threads [fihrillce) lying together is a fibre. 3. A bundle of fibres is called Si fasciculus. 4. A number of these bundles [fasciculi] make muscle.

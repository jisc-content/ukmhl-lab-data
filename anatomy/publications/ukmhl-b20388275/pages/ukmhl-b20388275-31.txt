27 HOLLOW BONES I rushed to pick up the baby, as one naturally does go first to the help of the most helpless; but though it roared with all its power, we soon found that no bones were broken. Its little bones were still soft, and had not been hardened by the earthy or mineral matter. But the poor slim old body lay and moaned, and only after we had got her to her home did we learn that the bone in her left arm was broken, and that the fingers in her right hand were damaged and crushed. The bone she broke is called the Kadius. You will see it marked in the skeleton. Her bones were brittle, because during her long life much earthy mineral matter had been added to them; and also because, as she was so thin, the little cells containing the fat, about which you learnt in the chapter on the skin, were all but empty, and so the bone had no warm covering of fat to protect it from the hard flag pavement. All bones are made up of two sorts of tissues— Compact {dense) tissue. Spongy tissue {cancellous). The hard, ivory sort of substance that every one has seen when they look at the bones in the butchers' shops is called compact (dense) tissue. The softer, looser sort of substance that is formed at the head of long bones is called spongy tissue {cancellous). Do you not know how easy it is to bite through the head of the chicken-bone leg, while the teeth will make little or no impression if they are tried in the middle of the same bone That is because the head of that bone is made of spongy tissue, with a very narrow rim, if any, of compact tissue. There are three sorts of bones in the human body— 1. Hollow Bones, such as those of the leg. 2. Flat Bones, such as those on the top of the skull. 3. Irregular Bones, such as the back-bone. I will now tell you what distinguishes each of these sorts of bones— I. Hollow Bones Have (i) an outer coat of compact or dense tissue. (2)

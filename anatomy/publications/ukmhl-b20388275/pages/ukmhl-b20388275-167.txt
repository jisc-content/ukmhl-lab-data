THE LUNGS 163 will show you one lung looking like a tree, and the other resembling a sponge. We will first talk about the tree-like appearance of The Lungs. After the windpipe (trachea) has divided into the two tubes {bronchi), they in their turn divide again into three other pipes, each smaller than the tube. They divide again, and each gets smaller as it divides and divides and divides, until the last and smallest tube is only about the fortieth part of an inch big, and the windpipe is, as you know, in a grown-up person one inch broad. At the end of each of these tiny tubes is an air cell. Here is a pic- ture of a group of air cells. Every time we draw breath we take in the air, which, as you know, travels down the wind- pipe till it reaches the two bronchial tubes. It takes its choice which of these two it will use. If it goes into the right lung, it will find three divisions waiting for it to fill. If it goes into the left lung, it will find but two—lobes they are called; but whichever lung it chooses to use, its work will be the same. Down one of the tubes it will go, dividing itself as the tubes divide, until at last the air will find itself at the end of the tiniest of all the tubes, and ready to fill Fig. 70.—A End of Gkoup of Air Cells at A SMALL Bronchial Tube.

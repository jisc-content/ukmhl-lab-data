THE AIR IN THE BLOOD l8l Now we shall see why it went there. These little air cells are full of oxygen, which you will remember was carried into them by the air after its long and interesting journey. The blood needs oxygen. So the air cells yield up their oxygen, which quickly goes through the thin walls of the tiny hair- like pipes {capillaries), and gets taken up by the red corpuscles of the blood; but that is not all. The blood is full of carbonic acid gas which it does not want. So this gas is sent out through the thin walls of the capillaries into the air cells, and from these it is returned by the bronchial tubes up into the mouth and out into the air. Now you know what it is that does this useful work inside the lungs. You know that air went into the body in one condition and returned in another, leaving some of its oxygen there. You knew that the body absolutely required fresh air to breathe, and you knew that it was poisoned if bad or dirty air was breathed, but you did not know till now what it was that did this useful work. But now you know. The little red corpuscle inside the tiny hair-like pipe {capillary) gathers up the oxygen that is in the air cells. The thin capillary walls let the carbonic acid gas out, and the body has thus got rid of its impurities, and got within it a quantity of blood made clean and fresh and red and strong by the oxygen that is needed. What is its fate now 1 Ah ! now begins its work of keeping alive and strong and pure all the organs of the body, but first it has to go again to the heart.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 128 inside the body to glide over each other. As the small intestine is so long, so closely packed, and so constantly moving, it needs a great deal of serum to oil it and enable it to move easily and safely. So the over-all coat has many glands in it, and they work both hard and patiently. II. The Outer Coat [Muscular) has in the small intestine only two instead of three different sorts of muscles. It has only what we may call the ^'long—short muscles and the "all-round'' muscles, or those which in the picture of the stomach, on page 117, we called A and B. Here is a picture which will show you more clearly the direction of the muscles in the small intestine. Fig. 54.—Showing the two sorts of Muscles that compose THE Outer Coat (Muscular) of the Intestines. In those lands where the sun has great power, it is of course much colder in the shade. One day in India we walked down a road where, if we had had a thermometer, it would have stood at 130 degrees. From there we turned into a courtyard closely shaded, with a fountain playing in the midst. Immediately the thermometer fell—20, 30, 40 degrees—settling finally at 88. It is these sudden changes that the little muscles around the intestines do not like. They are busy doing their work, stretching out lengthways, squeezing up roundways: suddenly they feel it cold, and the cold stiffens them so that they cannot go on moving so fast or so regularly as they ought. This being so, the food is not pushed along the small pipes ; it stays in the intestines. Pain is the result, and sometimes serious illness. When we were in Ceylon we heard of a young lady who lay a dying of an illness brought on because she had neglected to wear extra flannel over her digestive organs. ^'You had better do it," her friend said; '^we all have to wear extra flannel here.'^

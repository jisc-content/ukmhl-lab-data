THE WILFUL OR INVOLUNTARY MUSCLES CHAPTER XI. THE WILFUL OR INVOLUNTARY MUSCLES, The last chapter was about the willing or voluntary muscles. There are a great number in the body, but you were only tolcl of a very few. Of two in the upper arm you learnt the names, the biceps and triceps; but there are many more, as you will see from the picture of the arm, which will give you some idea of the number and variety of these elastic bands which enable our limbs to move. When one is young the brain is not strong enough to take in much, and if I told you the names and uses of all these muscles you would not be able to remember them nor to understand the lesson; but the picture will teach you that there is a great deal more to learn about the body, and will help you to feel reverence for this wonderful work of Nature that you have to keep clean, healthy, and under control. You will perhaps have seen old people with lumbago. They are bent down with pain. ^' Ah ! I have got the lumbago," they say. You may have felt sorry, and perhaps you have tried to help them by pushing them upstairs, or fetching any- thing they may have wanted when they have once sat down, knowing that a move hurts them; but now you will know what lumbago is. It is cold that causes stiffness in the lumbar muscles of the back, and if you turn to the skeleton, page 26, you will see where the lumbar vertebrae are, and guess from it, what is the truth, that the lumbar muscles are those near and iround them. But now we will talk of The Wilful {involuntary) Muscles. These act and move and do their work whether we wish it or not. The heart is made of these muscles, and they contract and expand constantly without our even thinking about them. D

THE BKEAST-BONE 35 " Oh dear !" some of my readers will say, " are we to learn about another material to-day?" "Yes, and no." Cartilage is hardly another material, though it has another name; it is much hke bone, only it has neither nerves nor blood-vessels, and less earthy or mineral matter. You will remember that you learnt that the bones of the little baby have not much mineral matter in them. They are soft and soon bend, and this is why little children get crooked or bandy legs if they are allow^ed to walk too much. Well, cartilage is much like baby's bones, only ^ with this difference: the little one's bones will get harder and firmer, if it is fed properly, as it grows older, but cartilage is of that sort that will never become bone. It will always be soft, for it is needed in places where it can bend or move without joints. The figure on the left hand of the picture is a side-view of the breast bone. While you are looking at it, please notice the little numbers that are marked at its side, about which you shall hear soon. You have already learnt about the great bone which goes down the back, and now you have heard about the shorter and softer bone which goes down the front of the body. They are the Back-bone and the Breast-bone ; or, Fig. (A The Breast-bone or Sternum. viewed from before ; B, viewed from the right side.) 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are the surfaces to which the corresponding costal cartil- ages are attached.

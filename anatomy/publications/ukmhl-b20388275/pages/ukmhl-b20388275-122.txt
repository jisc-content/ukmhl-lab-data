Il8 THE MAKING OF THE BODY movement the food is kept moving, not only from right tu left, but from the top to the bottom of the stomach. The C muscles shorten and lengthen, and their action j)revents the food from remaining still. It is thus kept ever on the move. If you have ever made a pudding, you will know how many different movements your hands have to make before the flour and the milk can be properly mixed. You not only throw the flour from the right to the left of the basin, you also lift to the top all that has sunk to the bottom, and you roll all together round and round till the parts are mixed. In a similar way the outer coat (muscular) of the stomach mixes up the food that has been swallowed, moving it somewhere else directly any of it settles or touches the inside wall of the stomach, which, 3^ou must not forget, resembles the gullet, in not only being soft and wet, but in being well lined with the inner or gland coat (nmcous). In the meantime, what is the inner coat (^mucous) doing ? It is not idle, for it is secreting and pouring out large quantities of a juice called The Digesting Juice (Gastric). In Chapter XXY. you Avere told about two sorts of glands, and how one sort—the preparing gland (secreting) —had the power of taking from the blood certain materials, making out of them a certain fluid, and storing it till it was wanted. The inner coat (mucous) of the stomach is very full of a special sort of these little glands, which are called The Digesting Glands (Gastric or Peptic). You have all seen them in tripe. Opposite is a picture of one of them. The narrow white pocket at the bottom of the figure is the gland, and we must imagine the food tumbling about where the word " food is marked. Directly it touches the little mouth or duct, the white pocket, which is full of the digestive juice (gastric), pours it

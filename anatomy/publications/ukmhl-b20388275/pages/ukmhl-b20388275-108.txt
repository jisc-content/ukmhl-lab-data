104 THE MAKING OF THE BODY CHAPTER XXYI. THE yOURNEY OF THE FOOD, THE TEETH. All the girls and boys who will read this book will be above seven years old, so they will all have got their second or permanent teeth. The first teeth, or milk teeth, as they are sometimes called, come when the baby is between six months and a year old; but they have no roots, and drop out when the little one is about five years of age. The number of the milk teeth is twenty, but when they disappear twenty-eight per- manent teeth take their place and do all the duty of chewing and grinding until the person is about twenty-one years old, when four more teeth are cut. These are sometimes called wisdom teeth, because they do not come out until, it is hoped, their owners have learnt wisdom. Here is a picture of a tooth. You will see that each tooth consists of three parts :— I. The Root or Fang; 2. The Neck; 3. The Crown. Teeth look something like bones, but they are not made of the same material, and in other ways are not of the same structure. They chiefly consist of a substance called Dentine, which is in itself somewhat soft, and soon decays if it is Fig. 45.—Section of a Tooth.

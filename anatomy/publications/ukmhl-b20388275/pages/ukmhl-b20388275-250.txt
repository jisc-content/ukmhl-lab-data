246 THE MAKING OF THE BODY about which you have often heard in this book, and which are called wet skins, or mucous membranes. This wet skin has a special name, or it may be called The Joining Wet Skin {Conjunctiva). It lines the eyelids, and then turns back again and goes over the eyeball itself. Thus the eyelid is lined and the eyeball covered with the same sort of skin, which face each other when the eyelid is shut. The use of the eyebrow and the eyelashes and the eyelids and the joining wet skin (conjunctiva) is to pro- tect the eyeball. Why does it need so much protection ? Because it is so delicate ] and it is not only delicate, it is very complicated and difficult to understand. The Eyeball is round, as its name shows. All that is visible, both the white and the coloured part, as well as a great deal more about which you are going to learn, is in- cluded when we speak of the eyeball. It lies in a socket. Did you ever see an orange sitting in the middle of a soft downy pillow ? That is how the eyeball sits in its socket. The eyeball is firm and hard; the socket is soft, and made of fat. If a child sat on the orange it would sink further into the soft cushion, but if it had been placed on a hard chair and some one had sat on it, it would have been crushed quite flat. It did not hurt much, dear, did it ? " said an anxious mother to her boy of eight, whose brother had just thrown a ball which had hit his eye. "No, mother, not much," he said, ^^my eye seemed to go in." What made the little chap say so I can't think, for I don't suppose he had ever heard of the eyeball lying in its cushion of fat, but his words expressed something very near the fact. As it lies comfortably on its fat cushion (orbit), the eyeball must be kept clean. How this is done must be told in the next chapter.

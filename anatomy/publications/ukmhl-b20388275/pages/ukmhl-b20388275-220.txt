2l6 THE MAKING OF THE BODY coverings are placed the touch corpuscles who object to heat, thereby doing their duty of protecting the eye, which is easily injured by scorching or becoming too hot. In Murano, near Venice, there are large glassworks where beautiful vases and ornaments are made Very lovely are some of the things, but you will think that they cost dear when I tell you that all the best glassblowers go blind when they are forty years old. The eyelids give warning that the eyes object to the heat, but the blowers' work compels them to disregard their warning; they keep their eyes open, and when in the full prime of life they lose their sight.

If this were not so planned we should probably pour things down our throats so hot that they would injure the deli- cate coats and glands inside the stomach, by the aid of which the food is digested. The touch corpuscles {tactile corpuscles) are more

In people who are quite grown up it is about 12 inches long, and that is why it is given this name.

But as you yet know nothing about the sweetbread {pancreas)., or the gall bladder, or the liver, so we must leave the food-paste {chyme) resting in the 12-inch pipe {duodenum)^ while we try to learn a little about them. ^'Eesting," did I say? That was a wrong expression. JSFot for one moment will the food-paste be allowed to rest, for the 12-inch pipe {duodenum) is surrounded by the same four coats as the stomach, and so they will go on working, and as they work they will moisten and tunable about the food in the same way as it has been tumbled in the stomach.

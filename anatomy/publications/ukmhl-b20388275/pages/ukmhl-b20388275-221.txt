WHERE WE FEEL MOST 217 numerous at the tip of the tongue than anywhere else. The grown-up Japanese people do not kiss one another; they say it " is a foolish foreign habit." They only kiss their tiny little children, and their kisses are very queer ones, like so many of their ways. The mother puts out the tip of her tongue, the little child does the same; both touch, and that is their kiss. They kiss, you see, with that part of their bodies where the touch corpuscles are most numerous. After the tongue the tips of the fingers are most sensitive. Blind people often read with their fingers which they pass over letters which have been raised in the printing. If you tried you could not feel the difference between the letters, but they have cultivated their sense of touch until it has grown, and become both much stronger and more delicate. Once I knew an old blind man who had lost both his arms, but he was very intelligent, and as he had no fingers with which to read, he learned to do so by his lips, for they, you know, are well supplied with touch corpuscles. The nose also has a good share. My brother was often naughty, and one day he pro- posed we should tickle grandpapa when he was asleep, so he began with a straw. It was not much fun, for he slept peaceably on till his nose was touched, then he jumped up with a start. Heigh ! yes ! what is iti Who is there?" he said, while we stooped low and hid behind his big chair. It was very naughty, but you have learnt with its help that the nose has under its skin many touch cor- puscles (tactile corpuscles). The sense of touch serves to us as a protection. Without it the body would get into many dangers and heed them not. "I feel nothing when I am painting," wrote a great artist. " A snake may crawl over my foot, a bird may sit on my shoulder, and I would not know it." Few of us get quite so unconscious as he did, for most of us are conscious of a touch, and this saves us from things hurtful or disagreeable.

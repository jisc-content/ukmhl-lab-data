THE MAKIXG OF THE BODY 200 This is a long bone, and a strong bone. It has one body and two heads, both of which are larger than the bone itself. One head is at the top of the bone, the other is at its lower end. Its top head fits into the cup or shallow saucer made by the collar bone {clavicle) and the shoulder bone [scapula). " Fits/^ I have said. AYell, fits is not quite the word, because if one thing fits another, it generally suits it exactly, and it would not be true to say that the head of the upper arm bone {Itumerus) exactly fits into the shoulder bone {sca'pula) cup, for it is much too large for it. Did you ever play the game of cup and ball % If you play with the big cup end it is easy enough. If once the ball gets into the cup it does not fall out. But if you play with the little cup end, greater skill will be required, for then the difiiculty is not only to catch the ball, but to keep it resting in the little cup, which is much too small. It is the same thing with the ball of the upper arm bone and the cup of the shoulder bone. The ball being big often slips out of the cup. ''His arm is broken, I fear,^^ said a young nurse who had volunteered to go and tend the sick wounded in the Franco-Prussian war. " jSTo, I think not,'' said the doctor; "not broken, only dislocated." " Pull! then, doctor, pull! pull him out and he'll come in ! I've seen many a one done," said the poor fellow, and then fainted with the pain, caused by the shaking waggon and the loss of blood from a fiesh wound in his leg. "What does he mean? " whispered the young nurse, dreadfully frightened, "The ball has slipped out of the cup, and gone beyond it," answered the experienced nurse. " It must be pulled down till it gets below the rim of the cup, and then it will slip in again. Don't be frightened," she added kindly, for she was sorry for the girl whose generous kind heart had made her volunteer to do work about which she knew nothing, and which frightened her so much.

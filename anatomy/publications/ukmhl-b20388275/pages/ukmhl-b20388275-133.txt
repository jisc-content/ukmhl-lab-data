How could I teach in this melting heat weighed down by more clothes 1" She was a teacher, and had come out to try and show the little black children some of the good and beautiful truths that are in the world. You need not fear,'' she said; ^' I am so strong, and I never catch cold." But she did, and her brave work was stopped, and the heathen children, for whose sake she had left home, country, and friends, remained untaught. III.

The Inner Coat (Mucous) is the fourth coat, and about this there are various interesting things to tell you. The inner coat {mucous) of the little intestine, like the inner coat (mucous) of the stomach and the duodenum, is full of glands which secrete various fluids.

THE JOURNEY OF THE BLOOD have such a rush of blood constantly driven against it, and should have some time to rest and recover itself," she was told, and she undertook the duty. Hour after hour she stood pressing her two fingers into the great artery so as to prevent the walls from bulging out. How tired she must have got, never moving or changing her position; how often, as she ached all over with fatigue and longed to sit down, or lie once for half-an-hour on the bed, she must have thought that all her efforts would be of no use; for the doctors could not promise that her husband would be cured, even if she could carry out this difficult task. But we are told that Love beareth all things," and she had the great joy of saving her dear husband's life. She was rewarded. To have anything the matter with the aorta is terrible, for, as you will see, it is the only pipe by which the clean oxygenised blood leaves the heart. As I have said, this big artery goes up first towards the neck and then arches over and runs down the body just in front of the backbone. As it goes down the body it gets smaller, because it gives out branches to carry the blood to all parts of the body, until just when it ends at the bottom of the back it divides into two big arteries, one to feed the right leg, and one to carry nourishment to the left leg. Tell me something about the circulation of the blood," the teacher once said to a boy who had been studying anatomy and physiology. Please, sir," said the lad, the blood goes down one leg and up the other." " Yery clever of it," said the teacher. " How does it get across ?" But that, neither that boy nor any other could answer, could they ? You will know better than that, I hope, for you will not forget that the blood gets taken out of the heart by arteries, and gets taken back to it by veins, and that the tiny hair-like pipes (capillaries) are the means by which it is conveyed from the one to the other.

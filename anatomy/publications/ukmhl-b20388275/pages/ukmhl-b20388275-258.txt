254 THE MAKING OF THE BODY sides it is re-named. You may not be able to remember its long name, so you may call it The Hairy Coat {ciliary processes). It does the work of a joinerâ€”it joins together the back and the front of the middle coat, and makes folds hardly bigger than hairs, in which tiny nerves and muscles are covered up safely. Two names already has this middle coat, and there are yet two more to learn about, for as soon as it gets exactly to the front of the ball it is called The Curtain {the iris). Here the colour cells reside which determine what is commonly called the colour of the eyes. What lovely eyes she has ! but I don't know what colour to call them," said a young girl who was enthu- siastic about her school friend. **Umphr' growled her brother, a medical student, who hated to hear what he called "girls gush." Why not say at once that her colour cells are un- equally distributed, and variable in size ? " " Really, George, you quite vex me," said his sister, *^as if her lovely eyes depended on her cells ! It is the soul in them that is beautiful." "All right, dear," replied the aggravating boy, but the colour is in the cells all the same." And he was right, although tiresome. It does depend on the colour-cells which are hidden away in the curtain (iris) whether eyes are brown or blue, grey, black, or green-hazel. In the very middle of the curtain (iris) is The Round Window {the pupil). We must speak of both these together. They are like the boy's shirt-front and his stud-hole; but first, with the teacher's kind help, we will make an experiment. Let one of the pupils be chosen, and let all the others look carefully at the pupils of his eyes.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY Down the big aorta, and down all its many branches —all called arteries—travels the blood, and the further it goes the more the arteries divide and sub-divide, until at last they are again reduced to the tiny capillaries. These have the same delicate thin walls as those about which we talked in the lungs. As they twine in and out of the skin, the intestines, the muscles, the brain, the stomach, the tongue, the toes, the glands, the throat- chamber, wherever they twine they carry the blood now red and bright and full of oxygen. The oxygen is what these parts of the body want, so the blood yields its oxygen and it enters into the muscles, or the skin, or the tongue, or w^hatever organ you can think of, and feeds it and enlivens it. Feeds it and enlivens or gives it life, I have said. Yes 1 that is what the bright blood does, but the organs want something more than that. They want their worn-out parts taken away, and the blood which they have used, and so made dirty, carried off; and here comes in some more work for the hair-like vessels (capillaries). These tiny tubes have, as I have already told you, only one coat, a very thin coat indeed; so fine is it that things can pass through it. Through these miles of fine coating the good clean blood passes out into the organs; through the miles of fine coating the dirty blood and waste stuff passes into the capillaries. What comes to it then ? Is it tired ? Does it rest? No, it rests notj it is drawn up into the small veins, and from them into the larger veins, and on and on it travels till it enters The Large Upper Vein {Superior Vena Cava), The Large Lower Vein {Inferior Vena Cava\ and from them it is poured into The Top Right Room {Right Auricle)^ and this is the place from whence we started when we first spoke of the circulation.

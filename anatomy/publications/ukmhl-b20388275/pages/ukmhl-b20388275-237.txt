THE MIDDLE EAR quickly as they could; and when they were gone, and it was no longer any fun to tease them, I still went on throwing the stones. Each one as it splashed made a ring in the water as it fell, and the ring widened and widened. "It will never stop," said nurse, who, as usual, came to see if I was spoiling my frock. " It is like a word. Once said, it goes on and on through the air." I did not understand her, and I am not sure she understood herself, but what she meant was that the word struck the air and made waves much like the stone had made them in the water. This is true. When your teacher says *^duty," the sound makes waves in the air, and these little waves enter into the wing {pinna) and travel down the passage, past the little hairs that turn their points all outwards, through the yellow wax, till they arrive at a sort of wall which reaches right across the passage. This wall is the end of the outer ear. It is called The Drum of the Ear (Tympanic Memhrane), It is made of a sort of thin muscular skin, and is stretched very tightly across the passage from one side to the other, much like the top of a drum is stretched across from one of its sides to the other. When we were in Japan I went to see a school where blind and deaf and dumb children were all brought up together. The blind played music, and made much noise, but the deaf went on with their queer painting quite undisturbed. The air waves were there hitting their ear drums, but the machinery inside was broken, and the brain got no news of it. One side of this little wall or drum of the ear ends the outer ear. The other side is the beginning of The Middle Ear. 'â€¢'Tis my wall, I tell you,'' said one country man. "It is not. I affirm it is mine," replied his neighbour. " There is sure proof that it is my wall," argued the first man, " for see it ends my field."

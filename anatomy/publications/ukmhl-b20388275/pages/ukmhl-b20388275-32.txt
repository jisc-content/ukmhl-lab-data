The compact or dense tissue is marked A. The spongy tissue {cancellous) is marked i)\ But I have not yet told you about the substance marked C. That is the marrow. Marrow consists of blood- vessels and cells full of fat. It is considered very nice to eat. Perhaps some child will want to know why the heads of the hollow bones are made of the spongy (cancellous) tissue. All things are made with a reason in the physical as well as the moral world.

But being made of the softer and more spongy tissue, each can give way, or yield a little, and so not injure the other. The other reason is, that compact {dense) tissue is

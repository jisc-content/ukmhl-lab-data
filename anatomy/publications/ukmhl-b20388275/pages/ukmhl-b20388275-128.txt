THE MAKING OF THE BODY 124 You may have seen the sweetbread of the ox or the sheep when it is sold in the butchers' shops. It, as Qhll BLADDER ■SPLEEN Fig. 52.—SnowiNa the Position of the Liver, Stomach, Sweetbread, Spleen, and i2-inch Pipe {Duodenum). well as the sweetbread (^pancreas) of a human body, is a sort of pale pink or coral colour; it is about seven inches long, and broader at one end than at the other. The Work of the Sweetbread {Pancreas) is to secrete a fluid. It takes from the blood certain materials, turns them into something else, makes a fluid of them which it pours into the 12-inch pipe {duodenum)] where the fluid joins the food-paste (chyme)^ and tumbles about with it and the bile until all is well mixed together. The fluid which the sweetbread {pancreas) secretes is called The Pancreatic Juice. The pancreatic juice does very much for the food-paste {chyme) what the spittle did for the food in the mouth. When I was a child, I was often very naughty, but I had a good and devoted nurse, who did all she could to teach me what was right. One day I took my biggest doll out for a walk.

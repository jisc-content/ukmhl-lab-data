37 THE RIBS The first 7 pairs are joined to the breast-bone at the places where the little figures are put in the picture. Count them, and you will find each of the seven fastened to the breast-bone. Ribs 8, 9, 10, are first joined to each other, and then fastened to Rib 7, which, you know, is the last one that is joined directly to the breast-bone. Ribs 11 and 12 are loose; they are merely sticking out, and move about as required. I should so like to show you all the beauties of the marvellous way in which the ribs are connected with the vertebral column at the back, with the breast-bone in the front, and also one with the other, but you cannot receive all this that I would give you. You are not yet old or clever enough, but you must try to understand and remember as much as I do tell you. I will show you a picture of a pair of ribs as they are joined to the breast- bone and back-bone. V is one of the bending bones or vertebra, which when put together make up the spinal cord (vertebral column); R R are the ribs; C C is the cartilage; S is the breast-bone. " What is cartilage ? " once asked the little girl who had intelligently listened to her elders' talk about a neigh- bour's illness. Don't you know, J enny ? Girls never do know things. It is what you fire a gun with," said her brother. " That is a cartridge, not cartilage," corrected their father, to the conceited boy's annoyance, and then he explained that cartilage was a kind of gristle which takes the place of bone when it is EiG. 12.â€”The Eibs and Breast-bone {Sternum).

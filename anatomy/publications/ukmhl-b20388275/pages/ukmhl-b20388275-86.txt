THE MAKINCt of THE BODY 82 they are not arranged in exactly the same way as they are when they enclose the brain itself. The brain is in the bony box of the skull which covers and protects it, and the spinal cord is packed in the bony box of the backbone, which enwraps it and saves it from rough usage. You will not have forgotten what you learnt about the backbone {vertehral column), and that we imagined it to resemble a row of cotton reels (vertehroe) threaded to- gether by a bit of string. Down the middle of the back- bone, through the holes in the centre of each of the bones, goes the spinal cord. It is composed of Nerve Fibres, white matter—carriers. Nerve Cells, grey matter—commanders. Between each one of the reels [vertehrce) there go in and come out a pair of nerves—sixty-two in all. Thirty- one go to the right hand side of the body, thirty-one find their way to the left hand side of the body. These nerves are called the spinal nerves. Each one has A Back Root {posterior). A Front Root (anterior). Here is a j^icture of two pairs of nerves coming out from between the reels (vertehrce) of the backbone. Fig. 35.—Nerves entering in and issuing from THE Spinal Cord. Very soon after they come from the spinal cord they join together, and then they are called a nerve trunk. It is the nerves that come through the front (anterior) holes that carry the commands about movement from the grey matter of the brain or spinal cord. It is the nerves

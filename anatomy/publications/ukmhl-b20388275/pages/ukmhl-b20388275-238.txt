It is a good thing that the outer ear and the middle ear do not quarrel in the same way about their wall, for that is what the drum of the ear (tympanic memhrane) is to them. 'Tis a sort of wall ending up the larger field of the outer ear, and beginning the smaller garden of the middle ear.

You will not, I hope, have forgotten that we spoke of it in Chapter XXYIII. when we learnt about the throat chamber (pJiarpix) and the doors leading into it. Air is very heavy. If we took a bit of wood measuring exactly an inch every way, and if we could weigh the air that just covered that bit of wood, we should find it

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 136 ^^How does the food get into the blood ?I do not think that I told yon that the inner coat {mucous) of the little intestines is all in folds. The object of this is to allow more room for the glands which, either of one sort or another, are closely packed all over the lining of the intestine. Here is a pic- ture which will show yon partly what is meant. In this picture some part of the outer coat is taken away, so we are looking, as it were, inside the small intestine. You will see the folds. It is as if we had pleated a yard of fine silk into a fur muff. But besides the glands which make or secrete the intestinal Fig. 58.—Part of the juice, there is something else packed Small Intestine LAID ^ ^^^^^^ ^-^^^^ ^^^^^ f^^^ ^^^1 OPEN so AS TO SHOW , , , . , , THE Folds. there are tiny mounds no bigger than hairs. A great many of them there are, so many indeed that you will be astonished to hear the figure, even if you cannot realise the number. Four mil- lion little greedy hairs are mixed up with the secreting glands, all lying close together, ready to do their work. This is a drawing of them. What is their work ? and why do you call them greedy ?" I can fancy I hear asked. Their names, though, I must first tell you. They are called Fig. 59.—A Bit of the Inner Qomi^ [Mucous) of the Small Intes- tine. The Shaggy Hairs (F?7//). The duty of these shaggy hairs {villi) is to take up the food from the intestine and use it.

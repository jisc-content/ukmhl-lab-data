2/2 THE MAKING OF THE BODY CHAPTER XVIL—NERVE FIBRES Run all over the body. Are of two kinds. Each nerve fibre is composed of three parts— I. The central part (axis cylinder). 2. The white substance. 3. The Swann sheath. A bundle of fibres covered by a skin [neurilemma) is a nerve. There are two kinds of nerve fibre— 1. Carrying-to {afferent), takes news to the brain. 2. Carrying-from (efferent)^ takes news from the brain. Both kinds within one skin {neurilemma) is a mixed nerve. Nerve fibres are generally white. CHAPTER XVIII.—NERVE CELLS or GANGLION Receive the messages from the nerve fibres, and act upon them. Are outside the brain. Inside the spinal cord. Along each side of the back-bone. Nerve cells are grey. CHAPTERS XIX. and XX.—THE SPINAL CORD Is the continuation of the narrow oblong brain {medulla oblongata). Is 18 inches long. Is enclosed in the back-bone. Is composed of— Nerve Fibres.—White matter. Carriers of news. Nerve Cells,—Grey matter. Commanders, creators. Consists of 62 nerves, forming the Nerve Trunh „ , „ , . , f Carry messaa^es to the brain.

Each pair of nerves unite and form a spinal nerve trunk. Contains grey matter, and can act without the brain.

257 THE WATER CHAMBER ^*It overworks your eye muscles/' she said. ^-As the fire jumps up and flickers down your pupil has to alter its size, and that tires the iris muscles." " It doesn't feel tired, dear," he said, "but I won't do it as it vexes you." A nice boy that. "No, thank you, ma'am, I would rather not be her maid," a young servant said. She was very ignorant, and had been sent to see a lady who it was hoped would take her and teach her good household ways. " Why not ? Do you not think you can trust her as a mistress ?" the girl was asked. " No, ma'am, I think she is mad," was the answer. " Mad ! what has given you the idea?" " The black spots in her eyes were an odd shape," the girl said, " and I have always heaixl such people are mad." " Foolish child," I said, for I knew that my friend had had to suffer an operation on the eye, by which the curtain {iris) had been cut. This had injured the delicate round muscle which opens or closes so as to admit the light waves through the round window (pupil), and prevented it acting as is usual in a circle. Thus the light waves had more space by which to enter and travel to the crystal glass, but the pupil was no longer round. I tried to explain something of this sort to the girl, but it was of no use. She would not go, preferring her ignorant opinion to "running the risk." Before we quite leave the curtain (iris) and its round window (pupil) I must tell you that in front of it is a chamber called The Water Chamber (Aquf^ous Humour). It contains several drops of water which float about between the horny coat (cornea) and the curtain (^iris). The light waves pass easily through this water chamber. The use is clear. It provides a space for the curtain (iris) to move in, much in the same way as the watch- glass contains an air space in which the hands of the watch can move. R

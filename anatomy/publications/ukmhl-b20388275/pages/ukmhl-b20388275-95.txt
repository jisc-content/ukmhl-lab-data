THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM 91 same way as the grey matter of the brain or spinal cord is enabled to do. '^In what way, then," you may ask, "does the Sympa- thetic (or ganglionic) system differ from the brain and backbone (cerehro-spinal) system?" " iN'ot much in what it does, a great deal in where it does it," would be the answer. The work of the Sympathetic system controls and influences only The Circulation, the Heart's work. The Digestion, the Stomach's tuork. The Respiration, the Lung's luork. We can liken the sympathetic system of nerves to a careful daughter or son. We will fancy a family, consist- ing of a father, mother, and daughter, all carrying on a business. The brain we will imagine to be the father of the family and the head of the household. To him come all the important matters, and he is asked what he thinks about these things, and what he wills to do about them. He is much engrossed and not very strong, and therefore his thoughtful wife—the spinal cord—saves him all she can, and decides many lesser matters herself. He is frequently aware by the results that take place that she has done so, but otherwise he is not troubled, and things are very well managed by his partner. But the wife also is much loved by her daughter, who for her i3art is most anxious to save her mother un- necessary care. "I cannot do much," we will fancy her saying, "but anyhow I can manage three departments of this great business without asking either mother—Spinal cord—or father—Brain—to settle things." So she does, choosing the three departments that, in healthy people, go on with most regularity, i.e.— The Circulation. The Digestion. The Res'piratlon. The sympathetic system of nerve knots lies, as I have said, on either side of the backbone, and is connected with the spinal cord by nerves of both the sensory and

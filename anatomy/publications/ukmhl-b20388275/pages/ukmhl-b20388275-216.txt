212 THE MAKING OF THE BODY The continuation of the instep bones {metatarsal) are The Toe Bones (Phalanges). There are fourteen altogether, divided among the five toes. " Which do you think is the thumb of the foot ?" I asked the children in a class. "The little toe," one child said. "It is the shortest, like the thumb." " The foot has no thumb toe," another answered. Both were wrong; for the big toe is the thumb of the foot, which, in another sense, "has no thumb toe," because the big toe cannot move about and stand opposite to the other toes as the thumb twists about in front of the fingers. Yery like fingers are the toes— in monkey bodies more so than in human bodies—but they enough resemble them to make the French people name the toes "the fingers of the feet." Altogether the bones of the feet form an arch. There are several reasons for this. In the south of France the women walk a great deal, bearing on their heads large baskets of lemons. The great weight sometimes causes the ligaments of their feet to give, and the arch drops and they become flat-footed. "It is my foot, dear lady, the doctor says, but I feel it in my head,'' was said by a dark-eyed, rich- skinned Italian girl in her pretty patois^ and though it sounds funny, it really was the truth. Her work had been to carry large baskets full of yellow lemons on her head, and the weight had injured the arch of the foot. One of the uses of the arch of the foot is to prevent the body being jarred by every step. If the arch has sunk and the foot falls flat, the jolt is felt all over, but especially in the head, which is the seat of so many of our finest powers.

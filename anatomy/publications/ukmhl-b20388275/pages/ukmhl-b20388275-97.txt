You will all remember the lesson about muscles, and how I told you they were bundles, or separate masses of flesh, which have the power of stretching or becoming long, or contracting and becoming short, like so many pieces of elastic put side by side, only some muscles are a hundred times smaller than any bit of elastic that any of us have ever seen.

76 THE MAKING OF THE BODY There are two sorts of nerve fibres, and they are called The Carrying-to Nerves [Afferent). The Carrying-from Nerves {Efferent). Each has its separate and distinct work. You will remem- ber that when we talked of the brain, yon were told that to one part of it was carried the news that your toe was trodden on, and from another part of it went the orderâ€” ^'Move the foot." IsTow it Avas a carrying-to {afferent) nerve that carried the news to your brain {sensory portion); through it was flashed the fact that pain was felt in your foot. The brain {motor portion) gave the order for the foot to be moved, and sent out its order by a carrying-from {efferent) nerve. Thus you see that both kinds of nerves have their uses. Did you ever have the curious sensation in any of your limbs that is called "going to sleep.'"' It is caused by the nerves not doing their duty. A friend of mine was going for a tour in France. He hoped to see the beautiful churches and cathedrals and to enjoy studying the various styles of architecture which are to be seen there. When he left Dover the sea was blue and sparkling, and he went up to the extreme end of the boAv to watch, the ship cut the waves that danced gaily around her. Soon, however, the wind arose, and it be- came so rougb that our friend was made very sea-sick. He lay down, hoping soon to feel better; but he got worse and worse, till when they reached land he had to be carried ashore. He soon got over the sea-sickness, but he had laid on his right arm till it had ''gone to sleep,'' and it would not awaken. By lying on his arm the little tubes had been flattened. Their walls were pressed together so that the fluid could not move easily about, and the road was not clear for the messages to be flashed up and down to the brain. Sometimes the liundles of nerve fibres that go to make up a nerve contain both afferent {carrying-to) and efferent

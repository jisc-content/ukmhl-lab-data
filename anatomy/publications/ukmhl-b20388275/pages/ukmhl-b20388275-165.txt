THE JOURNEY OF THE AIK l6l dreadful storm arose. The ship tossed about so much that the captain ordered the sailors to send all the men and women and children down into a large room under the deck, because he was afraid they might be in the way. The sailors fastened the doors so that they could not get out. The storm went down in a few hours, when the captain told the sailors they might open the doors, or hatches, as they were called. The sailors took a candle, because the room where these poor creatures were put was quite dark. When they entered the candle went out. They lighted it again, and it went out a second time. This was done several times. At last it remained alight, and so they were able to descend. And what do you think they found'? Nearly all the men, women, and little children lying on the groundâ€”some of them dead, others unconscious. The only air they had had to breathe was the air that had come out of their mouths." ^ And as that was not fresh air, it had poisoned them. This is a sad story, but it taught a great lesson, for no one now puts either people or animals into rooms where fresh air cannot get in ; though few people, even among those who know something of physiology or anatomy, are quite as particular about methods of getting fresh, clean air into their houses as they should be. It was because the air was dirty, or poisonous, that the people shut up in the ship died, for our bodies need all the oxygen that is in the air. Each time any of these poor people took in a breath, more of the whole- some oxygen was used up; each time any of them breathed out a breath, more of the poisonous carbonic acid gas was in the room; and the absence of the oxygen and the presence of the carbonic acid was what caused some to die, and others to become unconscious. 1 "Health in the House," by Mrs. Buckton.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 132 In order the better to understand this wonderful organ, you must imagine the liver to be a palace containing not ten or twenty, but hundreds of roomsâ€”and yet the word palace hardly describes it, for all the rooms are work- shops. In each one very important work is done. There are two entrances by which things get into this palace, but only one way for them to leave. It is true that there are two doors that lead out of the palace, but one goes only to the store-room. About each of these doors, and what goes through them, we will now speak. The first is called The Gate Vein (Por^a^ Vein). You will not have forgotten that around the stomach and sweetbread (pancreas) there are hundreds of little blood- vessels, and that these take from the food as much mate- rial as they can carry. When they have taken every- thing they can get they carry it all towards the liver, and it is the gate vein (portal vein) which conveys it into that organ. Once inside it is conveyed into one of the workrooms which is called A Lobule. This workshop is not very big, only about ^^th. of an inch in width, but wdthin it wonderful changes take place. The rich blood is robbed of its richness. All that it does not want is taken from it, and made up into something else. This something else is called The Bile. The blood is then sent on again, but the bile is sent out of the liver by one of the doors, and conveyed to the store-room, which is known as The Gall Bladder. It is the shape of a pear. Opposite is a picture of it. " One of the doors," I said, and added nothing more about it; and yet you would like to know that it has a name, and is, in fact, a very important passage* It is plainly marked in the figure, and is called The Liver Passage (Hepatic Duct).

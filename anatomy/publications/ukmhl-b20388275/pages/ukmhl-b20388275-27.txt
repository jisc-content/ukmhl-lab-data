SWEAT GLANDS AND DUCTS 23 swollen; in thin people they are empty and much smaller. Fat cells are very useful; they are like a thick woollen garment, keeping the body warm. We all know how much colder thin people feel than fat people do. One of the reasons of this is because the fat cells of thin people being empty, the heat of the body gets out, and so they feel cold. Do you know what is meant by The pores of the skin? Once more turn to Fig. i. You will see three lines going down it marked li. Let us follow them. They are a little twisted as they go through the upper skin {epidermis)^ a; quite straight as they pass between the colour cells {Malpigliian lai/ei'), h; wavy in the true skin {dermis)^ c ; and all coiled up as they lie between the fat cells. These lines are meant to represent The pipes to carry sweat {sivcat ducts). The coils to collect sweat {sweat glands). The openings of the ducts on the top of the epidermis, marked i i i in the picture, are the pores of the skin which eject sweat. Around each of these little coils or sweat glands are numberless blood-vessels. As the blood hurries along through these vessels it is the duty of the sweat glands to take from it a fluid that is called perspiration. Then begins the duties of the sweat ducts or pipes. They have to pass the perspiration which the glands collect upwards, and push it out of the pores. You have all seen perspiration standing in little drops on the face of a man who is hard at work, or who has been running fast. The tiny drops come out of the pores of the skin, which are the mouths of the sweat ducts, and every day as much as two pints of perspiration should pass through these pores. If dirt is allowed to be on the skin, the sweat cannot get out; it has to reniEiin inside ; and as it consists of something which the body wants to get rid of, it injures and weakens the body.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 228 result. If we do not want to speak, the vocal cords hang loosely, and the air passes easilv in between them and out without causing a sound. " You must not even try to speak in public for three months at least; your vocal cords must have rest," was the verdict given the other day to a public speaker. It did seem a pity, for this man seldom spoke out publicly without doing good, but there was no cure for it. He had lost his voice " because, as he shouted out of doors to great crowds who were too poor to hire halls, he had stretched his vocal cords too much, and now they refused to obey. If we could have seen them they would have looked like a bit of elastic out of which all the " stretch " had gone. , In more than one way do the vocal cords move, as you will see by this picture. The first, A, shows how the Yoice-hox (larynx) would look during the singing of a high note. The second, B, tells its appearance while quick breathing only is going on. The third, C, indicates how it would look while a very deep breath was being taken. So much for the voice-box (laTynx)^ but that is not the only part of the body that is concerned in producing speech. The brain also has to work. Fig, 100.

WAVES OF LIGHT 255 Then let him be placed with his back to the light, and as much as possible in the dark. If the cupboard is opened, and he stands looking into it, the door will shield him from the light, or an umbrella may be put up to keep it from his eyes. Then give him a book of very small print, and ask him to read. I can't see," he will say. " You must look closer and try," you will answer. He must be kept reading for three or four minutes, and then when he is brought out into the light you must quickly look again at the pupils of his eyes, which you will see are much larger than they were when he first tried to read in the darkened place.

It may be the middle of the day in India when the sun is the brightest, but the blind man sitting there under the palm tree cannot see the light because the delicate instrument that ought to enable him to catch the ether rays has got damaged.

The pupil looks black, but it really is no colour at all. It only looks dark as the opening to a tunnel appears black. The curtain (iris) has some very curious muscles, which enable it to make its round window (jpupil) large

59 THE FACE AND ITS BONES nose, a small but most important feature, it being the means by which a person is often told what is good and what is harmful to him ; for generally unwholesome things smell badly, and what is good is sweet-savoured. The Two Cheek Bones {Malar) are marked 3 in the picture. You can easily find them in your own face, and see them in other people's. Some races have much higher cheek bones than others. Indeed, races are recognised by the difference in the shape and size of their face bones.

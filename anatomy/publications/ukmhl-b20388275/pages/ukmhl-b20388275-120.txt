THE MAKING OF THE BODY ii6 CHAPTER XXIX. THE JOURNEY OF THE FOOD, THE STOMACHâ€”ITS COATS AND ITS GLANDS. In the last chapter we brought the food from the mouth to the lower end of the gullet {oesophagus)^ and left it just as it was, all ready to enter the stomach. The gateway or door by which it enters that important place is called The Stomach Door {Cardiac Orifice). Through this doorway the mouthful of food enters, and immediately finds itself in a big bag, shaped some- thing like both a pear and a carrot, and not much like either. This bag is called The Stomach, and it has four coats. Three of them are exactly like the coats of the gullet (oesophagus), with exactly the same duties. The Inner Coat (Mucous Gland), The Outer Coat (Muscular), The Middle Coat (Connective). The fourth stomach coat is called The Over-All Coat (Peritoneum). To this is given a new work, that of secreting a fluid which you may call Whey (Serum). This fluid or serum is very necessary, for the difi'erent parts of the body are packed quite close to one another. It would never do for them to stick together or to become hard and dry, for then they would run the risk of cracking or scratching each other. So around most of the organs is placed a secreting over-all coat, called difi'erent names in

THE TOES AND THEIE BONES 211 " Not broken—only dislocated, I hope," said a more hopeful member among the talkers. " JSTo ! it was broken, I am sure,'' repeated the first speaker; " but what does it matter whether you say broken or dislocated ? It is all the same thing, I suppose." But there is so much difference between the two that it does matter. If it is said that the ankle is broken, it means that one of the ankle-bones is itself injured or shattered. If it is said that the ankle is dislocated, it only means that the leg-bone has slipped off its place on the ankle bone, and can be easily put back again. Just where the seven ankle-bones (tarsal) leave off the Instep-Bones {Metatarsal) begin. There are five of them, and they, like the palm bones in the hands, are the beginning of the toes. (^1 Fig. 91.—Right Foot, viewed from above. a, b, cd, e, f, g, and h, the tarsal bones ; I to V, metatarsal bones ; i and 3, phalanges of great toe ; i, 2, and 3, phalanges of second toe.

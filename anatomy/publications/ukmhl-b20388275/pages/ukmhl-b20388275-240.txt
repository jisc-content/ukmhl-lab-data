THE MAKING OF THE BODY 236 The hammer {malleus) leans close and tight against the drum skin, and when it shakes the hammer shakes too. The anvil (incus) leans close and tight against the hammer, and when it shakes the anvil shakes too. The stirrup (stapes) is fastened on to the anvil, and when it shakes the stirrup shakes too. Here is a picture of them— Anvil. Fig. 102.—The Ear Bones. The Hammer (malleus). The Anvil (inctis). The Stirrup (fttapes). by which you will see their shapes. Turn now to diagram on page 231 and you will see exactly where they are placed. The hammer is tight against the drum of the ear. The anvil is tight against it; tight to it is the stirrup, and the stirrup itself is tight against a queerly-shaped bone. About this odd-shaped bone I must now tell you. It is very difficult, but you must make a strong effort, and the blood will obey your will and fly to your brain to feed it and help you to understand what is coming. There is a picture on page 239 of The Inner Ear (Osseous Labyrinth). It has three parts. The central part looks like nothing in particular, but the right hand part of it is something like a shell, and the other part of it is something like a bow of ribbon in three loops.

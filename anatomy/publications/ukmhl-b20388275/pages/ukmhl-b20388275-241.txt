THE INNER EAR The part that looks like a shell is called The Shell Tube {Cocldea). If we were to cut it open and apply a very strong micro- scope and much patience, we should find a great deal in it to astonish and delight us. The part that looks like loops of ribbon may be called The Ribbon Loops {The Semicircular Canals). If you look you will see that though there are three loops, yet they only have five instead of six openings, Fig. 103.â€”The Right Bony Labyrinth. .1. Vestibule ; 2. fenestra ovalis ; 3, 4, and 5, semicircular canals ; 6, 7, and 8, the cochlea ; 9. fenestra rotunda. Ihe smaller figure below shows the natural size. because two of them join together before they run into the middle part. This middle part is called The Entrance Room {Vestibule). I shall have something to say about each part sepa- rately, but I must also tell you of a wonderful arrange- ment which concerns them all. These three parts are all full of water, and the name of the fluid is Clear Water {Perilymph).

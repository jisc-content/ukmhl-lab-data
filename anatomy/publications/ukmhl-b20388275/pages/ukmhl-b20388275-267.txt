THE SEEING NERVE 263 The bottom of one thing must be on the top of another. This sounds very profound, but yet it is quite easy. Think a moment. You are standing. The bottom of your feet are resting on the top of the floor. You are in a house. The bottom of the house is resting on the top of the land. So it is true in the eye. The net- work (retina), which you will remember is the bottom coat of the eyeball, now becomes the top of this glassy water (vitreous humour). The retina is a very fine network, chiefly composed of tiny nerves. It has, as it were, hundreds of wee arms. These it puts round the jelly-like ball and waits for its work. What is its work ? A very important one. It takes all the images which the crystal glass (crystalline lens) brings to it, and tells the news to the brain much in the same way as during a war a telegraph clerk would receive news from any one who brought it to him, and telegraph it to headquarters. The road by which all these messages go is by The Seeing Nerve (Optic Nerve), The optic nerve is the eye's messenger. Quickly it travels to the brain, and, behold ! we see. Look at your slate pencils. Is there one thinner than the others'? If so, it is about as thick as the seeing nerve. All the tiny nerves of the network coat (retina) are gathered together till they make this seeing nerve, which then goes straight through the coloured coat (choroid) and hard coat (sclerotic), and out of the eyeball into the brain. All the parts of the eye are important, each in their different degrees and positions, but the two most impor- tant are the crystal glass (crystalline lens) and the net- work (retina). If either of them are injured we cannot see, even if all the other parts are perfect and beautiful. People are often^ colour-blind, and terrible railway accidents have taken place because the retina in the engine-driver's eyeballs is not quite perfect and able to distinguish between the different colours.

CHAPTEE XXVIII. THE JOURNEY OF THE FOOD, THE UVULA THE THROAT CHAMBER OR PHARYNX THE GULLET OR (ESOPHAGUS. To-day we will take a mouthful of food, and follow it on its journey till it reaches the stomach. First it Avill be rolled by the tongue, then it will be bitten, torn, chewed, and ground by the teeth. From the mouth glands the spittle {saliva) will be poured upon it, and at last it will be ready to leave the mouth and begin its journey towards the stomach. If you take a looking-glass, and open your mouth ivide^ and say "Ah-h-h-h-h !" you will be able to see a little bit of flesh hanging from the io]) of the mouth, j)ink and soft, which jumps up and down very quickly as the sound of Ah-h-h-h !comes out of your mouth. That bit of flesh is called ™ tt ^ The TJvula. The hard palate is the roof of the mouth. The soft palate is the continuation of the hard palate, and lies at the back of the mouth. At its very end it is called the uvula, which as the food reaches it will jump up and let it pass, and then the food will find itself in a kind of chamber or room called The Throat Chamber (Pharynx), There are five openings into it. 1. I from the ear (Eustachian tube), 2. I from the nose (nasal passage), 3. I into the lungs (larynx). 4. I from the mouth. 5. I to the stomach.

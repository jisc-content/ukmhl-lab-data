The heads of the bones are larger than the other parts, and if the large heads were made of the heavier substance, they would be too weighty for the rest of the bone. Now you must learn a little about— 2. Flat Bones. Here is a picture of one. Flat bones consist of a layer of the spongy {cancellous) tissue, which, you will remember, is the soft and porous substance between two layers of the compact {dense) tissue, which is the hard, ivory - like substance. A shoulder of mutton will give a good ex- ample of this sort of bone. 3. Irregular Bones. Both the irregular and the short bones are composed of spongy {cancellous) tissue, sur- rounded by a covering of compact {dense) tissue, and this varies in thickness according to the work the bone has to do, or the place it occupies. The spongy bone {cancellous) looks something like a sponge. It has little holes all over it, and in these holes there is a kind of marrow, or collection of fat cells and blood-vessels.

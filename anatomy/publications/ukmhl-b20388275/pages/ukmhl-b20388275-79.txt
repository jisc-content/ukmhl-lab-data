75 THE NERVE STORE-ROOMS ■AXIS CYLINDER .—WHITE SUBSTANCE about Xature's laws. He says, in speaking of tlie e(Mitral part (axis cylinder) of a nerve— " Imagine a telegraph cahle made of delicate indiarnhber tubes filled with mercury—a squeeze would in term] )t tlie electrical continuity of the cable without destroying its physical continuity." Later in the lesson I will further explain this to you. The White Substance is the coat of the delicate tul)e. It protects it, and over both is The Swann Sheath, so called because a Mr. 8wami was the first gentleman to discover its existence. Here is a picture of white nerve fibres. But nerve fibres are not nerves. Each strand of a rope is not a rope, though it goes towards making one. There must be many laid side by side, and in the same way there must be quite a little bundle of nerve fibres all laid together before we can have A Nerve. The nerves have for their work that of mes- sengers; to all parts of the body do they run, not only to those parts which we can see, like the hands, arms, legs, and face, but they are also to be found around every organ inside the body— the heart, the lungs, the liver. Each and every organ has its messengers, the nerves. They are of various sizes. At the nerve trunk they are quite large, and then they divide and subdivide until they become very tiny, like the finest hairs, EiG. 30.—White Nerve Fibres, SHOWING the Axis Cylinder, White Substance, and Sheath OP Swann (much Magnified).

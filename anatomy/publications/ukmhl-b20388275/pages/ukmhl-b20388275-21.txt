WHAT IS GROWING? 17 two words which carry sadness to those who under- stand them—the "irreparable past/' and they mean that what is done cannot be undone. And yet into our hands is given the future, however badly we have used the past ; and it is also true to say of our bodies, as of other things, " It is never too late to mend." But mended things are not so nice as whole ones, are they ? Neither shoes, nor tea-cups, nor chairs, nor anything else that one can think of; and this is also true of human bodies. Thus it would be better so to treat our bodies that they never get injured beyond what they themselves can repair. They can manage to do all the repair necessary for fair, honest usage, but they cannot mend themselves if they are injured by accident, or man's disobedience to the golden rules of health ; rules which have to do with food, heat, cleanliness, light, exercise, rest, and perhaps the most important, if the most difficult, self- control.

One wise man I put the ques- tion to replied that— Growing is the assimilation of certain portions of the environment by the animal or plant that grows." In the Dictionary you will find it is stated that to grow "is " to produce, to raise, to become enlarged, to advance towards a state, to extend, to improve, to become."

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 204 On the right hand side of the picture you will see the ligaments of the wrist; and on the left you will see the upper arm bone {humerus), and the elbow bone (ulna), and the spoke bone (radius), all bound together by their binders or ligaments. Bound to the elbow (ulna) and spoke bones (radius) are the wrist bones (carpal bones), and they, in their turn, are fastened by their ligaments to the Palm Bones (Metacarpal Bones). Of these there are five. Unless you look very carefully at the picture, you will think that they are only the beginning of the fingers and thumb. So they are, but instead of being each separate they are all bound together by the flesh and skin. It is quite easy to feel the palm bones. Try, and you will be able to trace each one from the wrist to the Finger Bones (Phalanges), We have four fingers and a thumb, but it takes fourteen Fig. 87.—The Right Hand before. bones to make them—three in each finger and two in the thumb. In this picture you will see each one clearly marked.

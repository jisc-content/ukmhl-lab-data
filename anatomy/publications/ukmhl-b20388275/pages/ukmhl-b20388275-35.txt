THE BACK-BONE 31 of cotton ? The reel will be this sort of shape. From one side of each reel we will suppose that a piece of wood projects. Now let us add to it two more side- pieces of wood, thus, and we shall have a reel with three little wooden flaps or wings sticking out of it. Let us fancy that we thread these queer-shaped reels on a bit of string, standing each reel on the top of the other reels. If we keep the string fairly tight we shall be able to bend what will now be a sort of stick made of reels to and fro, and this will be a rough model of the back-bone of the human body. The back-bone (vertebral column). The spine is made of a number of bones, each standing on the other, as we imagined the reels doing. Each of these bones is called a bending bone (yertehra). The part marked S in the picture is the a body of the vertebra; the part marked M is the hole or channel through wh ich the spinal cord goes, just as we imagined the string go- ing through the cotton- reels. The parts marked E, are the three wings (processes). Now turn again to the picture of the spine, and you wiii see how the round, smooth parts, i.e., S, of each turning bone (vertebra) lie inside the body, the pointed wings or pro- cesses being placed outside. The spine often gets out of ordero I remember, when I was hardly older than any of you, seeing a little boy who was always lying down taken out every day for an airing in a long wheeled couch. We used to run about with our hoops or enjoy Body YiG, 7.â€”A Bending Bone (Vertebra).

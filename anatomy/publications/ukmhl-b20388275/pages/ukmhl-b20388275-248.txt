THE MAKING OF THE BODY 244 CHAPTEE LVII. THE yOURXEY OF THE LIGHT. THE EYE AND ITS COVERS. To-day we are going to talk about the eye, that wonder- ful organ which enables us to know so much that ears cannot hear or fingers touch. Just pause a moment or two, and try and think what you take in by your eyes which no other sense helps you to understand. How sad it is when those beautiful organs get injured, and the "-soul windows'" are for ever curtained. Blind people lose a great deal. Which would yoti rather be—blind or deaf?" an old and gentle lady was once a>ked. Deaf/' she immediately replied, Avithotit waiting a moment to think, ^'becatise I could then see when people wanted helping. If I were blind I shotild have to wait until they told me." Did it not show a sweet and sympathetic nature that her first thought was not for herself or what she would lose, but which sense enabled her to be of most use to other people 1 The eye is a very delicate instrument, easily injured, diflicult to repair, and not at all simple to tmderstand. However, once more you must try and ''"put on yotir thinking-caps," as one of my little ptipils used to say when anything very difiicult had to be learnt. "W'e will first speak of those parts which have as their object the protection of the eye. There are three of them— The Eye Brows, The Eye Lashes, The Eye Lids. The eyebrows are little rows of hairs just at the bottom of the forehead, one over each eye. If you ask. What is their use ?" I should have to answer, A twofold use."

THE HEARING NERVE seem to have any idea of music to begin with, and then played the piano well in later life." But she can^t," urged the doctor, she can't create in her ear that which nature has left out." Both were right to a certain extent. Some people have either more little hammers or more little hairs than others, and those people are the musical ones. They can hear the tiniest difference in the sound waves which others cannot distinguish. Some animals hear far better than human beings. A horse or a dog can hear notes that we cannot; but, on the other hand, there can be no doubt that trying to hear and distinguish sounds, which is done by the culti- vation of music, helps these little organs to develop and become more alive, just in the same way as working at the forge helps the blacksmith's muscles to grow and become strong. Listening is ear-growing. There is an extraordinary difference between wave sounds. If I struck the lowest note which the human ear can hear, it would travel into your ear in about the fourth of a second, and if we could measure it as we could measure the wave made by the stone thrown into the pond, it would be about twenty yards long. But if I struck the highest note that the human ear can hear, it would travel to your ear so fast that 74,000 of them would only take one second to reach it, and if we could measure it, it would be less than a quarter of an inch long. Is there not a great difference between the two ? Lowest, twenty yards long, the fourth of a second to travel. Highest, less than one-fourth of an inch, and 74,000 in a second. Can you not now imagine how delicate and fine must be the instrument which can measure all these sounds, and how important it is not to injure it.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY which will show you more clearly the three flaps as they would look when they are distended with blood, something, as you will see, like parachutes. But now we have waited long enough to speak of the valves. If we had kept the blood in the bottom room {right ventricle) all the time we have been leaving it there in imagination, we should all have been dead, for it has to pass through both rooms in something like three- quarters of a second. When the bottom room (i-if flit ventricle) is quite full, the muscles in its walls squeeze together suddenly and jerk the blood all out in a moment through a big pipe which is called The Lung Artery {Pidmonctrij Artery), But the heart does not stop its labours. No ! Ko sooner has it got rid of all that was in the right lower room {right ventricle) than the upper room fills again. From there it flows into the lower room. The three flap valve works again, once more the ventricle jumps, once more the twelve tablespoonfuls of blood is jerked on, and so on and on it goes, never stopping until Death does his work, and the heart stops. I once knew an old gentleman whose three flap valve {tricusjjicl valve) was out of order. Something was wrong with the little flaps, and they did not work so as to completely close the trap door, and so some of the blood which had left the top right room {riglit auricle), and ought to have been safe in the bottom right room {riglit ventricle)^ got back again into the upper storey. Poor gentle gentleman! He was very good and patient, but the consequence was that the heart, in trying to empty itself, had to make a still bigger jerk than usual, and that shook him all over. He could hardly hold a book steady enough to read, and as he much liked learning what men were doing for the government of the country, and what fresh discoveries were being made in science, his life was made sadder and emptier, all because his little three flap valve did not close quite tightly.

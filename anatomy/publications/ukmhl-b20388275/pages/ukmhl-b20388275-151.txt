THE COLON again into the smaller intestine ; but in order to prevent it doing this there is a curious and wonderful arrange- ment in the large intestine called A Valve {the ileo-ccecal valve). When the food has once passed through the valve it reaches the large intestine, and the work of digestion begins again. The large intestine is called The Colon.

There are no shaggy hairs {villi) in the colon, but there are many blood-vessels, and these little greedy suckers take up all the nourishment that has been left in the food, until at last nothing remains in the colon but waste. If the waste material were allowed to remain in the body it would cause illness, so it is necessary that it should be ejected. For this purpose there are placed in the colon some delicate nerves which become irritated when they are touched. As the waste material touches and irritates them they set in motion some involuntary muscles, which slowly push out all that which the body no longer wants. Now, my pupils, that you have learnt a few facts about the food, and how it becomes chyme and chyle and gets absorbed into the blood, you will the more easily understand why one sort of food is wholesome and another unhealthy. All the children who belong to a Band of Hope have learnt that beer and wine and spirits are bad for health, and they are told that the spirit, or alcohol, which is in one and all of such drinks, inflames the blood and injures the body. You also know a little of the reason why, for you have learnt something of the mucous membrane of the stomach. You have learnt how delicate and how numerous the gastric glands are, and it is not difficult to fancy how the burning spirit inflames them, and to believe that the alcohol, whether it be in beer, wine, or

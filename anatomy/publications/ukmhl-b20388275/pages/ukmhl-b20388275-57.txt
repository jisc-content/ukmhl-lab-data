THE HEAD AND ITS BONES 53 The Forehead {Frontal Bone) is the bone that makes the front-head* It makes the front and a part of the top of the box. If the frontal bone sticks out it allows lots of room for the brain behind it to grow, and you will hear people say—"He ought to be clever; he has a good forehead." "A good forehead" does not necessarily mean that the person who has it is clever; for although he may have lots of room for his brain, he may not have used it, and it is only a well-used brain that makes a man clever. There are— Two Partition Bones {Parietal), one on each side of the head, and they make parts of the sides and part of the top of the head box. The Occipital Bone is the large one that lies immediately above the neck at the back of the head. It makes part of the back and a large part of the bottom of the box, for when it reaches the neck it does not abruptly end, but turns under, just as the bottom of a box is the continuation of the side. Right through this bone is a hole, about i \ inches across, through which the spinal cord passes, which, as you know, goes right down the backbone as the cord went through the row of cotton reels. The Two Temples {Temporal Bones) lie, one on each side of the head, immediately behind each of the ears. They form part of the sides of the head box. The bone marked 7 in the jDicture is The Wedge Bone {Sphenoid). The bone runs right through the head, and forms part of the bottom of the box. It starts just Avhere the hair begins to grow on each side of the head, and goes behind the nose, and part of it forms the sockets of the eye. It is an irregular and complicated bone, too difficult in its structure for children to understand. The Sieve-like Bone {Etliinoid) is also a part of the side of the brain box. As you will see in the picture, it runs a little up towards the frontal

88 THE MAKING OF THE BODY because you Avould close your eyes from instinct, and before your brain had had time to receive (in its sensory IDortion) the news that a blow was threatened, or to send (by the motor iierves) the command that the eyelids were to be drawn over the eye to preserve that wonderful little organ. ^N'o, the news never got to the sensory chamber of the brain; it only got as far as the nerve centres in the brain which have to do with the eye, and from there the reflex action took place which caused the eyelids to close. If a child is very hungry, and sees something good to eat, his mouth waters. The idea entered the nerve centre in the brain by the carrying-to (afferent sensory) nerve of his eye, but no order is carried back to the eye. Reflex action causes the carrying-from {efferent motor) nerves of his mouth to be set in motion, and their action causes the saliva to flow. Choking is very often entirely a matter of reflex action. Sometimes people will choke in their sleep. Some saliva or a little remnant of food will go down what is called the "wrong way." Unconsciously they will begin to cough and splutter. Reflex action is set up, the grey matter both receiving the news that the saliva or food is where it should not be, and giving the command that by coughing it should be evicted as an unwelcome tenant. All that you have been learning about is a part of The Brain and Backbone System {Cerebrospinal). Now, before we finish this chapter, I must tell you that there are no less than twenty-four very important nerves. Not but that all and each is important, but these twelve pairs are specially so. They are called The Skull Nerves (Cranial). It is always easier to understand a diflicult thing if you see it in a table, so I will make you one below this. From it you will see a little about each pair of nerves and what they have to do. One pair carries to or from the brain all the messages and commands aboutâ€”

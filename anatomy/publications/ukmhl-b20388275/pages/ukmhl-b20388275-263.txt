It is very fine and goes all round the back of the eyeball. Just as the coloured coat {choroid) lines the hard coat {sclerotic), so the network coat {retina) lines the coloured coat {choroid}). It is always easier to see things in little tables, so here is one which will show you the coats of— The back of the eyeball. The front of the eyeball. The middle of the eyeball. At the back of the eyeball are— 1. The Hard Coat [sclerotic). 2. The Coloured Coat {choroid). 3. The Network Coat {retina). In the middle of the eyeball is— 4 and 5. The Hairy Coat {ciliary process). At the front of the eyeball are— The Joining Wet Skin {conjunctiva). The Horny Coat {cornea). The Water Chamber {aqueous humour). The Curtain {iris), in the centre of which is The Round Window {pupil). The Crystal Glass {crystalline lens). The Glassy Water {vitreous humour). 6. . 7. 8. 9 and 10. 11. 12.

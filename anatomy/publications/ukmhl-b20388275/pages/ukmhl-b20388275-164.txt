l6o THE MAKING OF THE BODY This wet skin {mucous memhrane) is full of tiny hairs, which are called Cilia. They constantly move, gently swaying to and fro, and always pushing upwards towards the mouth. Their work is to catch any little bit of dirt or dust that may come in with the air, and push it out again, so as to prevent it getting into the finer bronchial tubes and air cells. " My cough is so bad. I am nigh to choking oft- times,'^ said an old Greenwich pensioner to me one day. He was a dear old man, and had been a brave sailor- soldier in his young days, being one of the people who had made England's ^' wooden walls" impregnable to her enemies. " Oh no; you won't choke," I said to him; and then I had to explain all about the little cilia and their work of pushing upwards whatever was in the air tubes. I told him how the heavy phlegm would injure the bronchial tubes if allowed to stay there, and so the cilia pushed it up until it touched the top of the larynx, and could then be jerked up. "Ah," he said, "I always thought man was clever; but there's somethings cleverer still." From the bronchial tubes the air passes into the lungs. About these wonderful organs you must learn in the next chapter.

The following story will prove this :â€”" There was once an emigrant-ship that sailed from Liverpool. The men and women and children on board were going to leave Old England to work in a strange land. One night a

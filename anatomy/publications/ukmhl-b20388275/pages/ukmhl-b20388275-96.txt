THE MAKING OF THE BODY 92 motor kinds, so that, if necessary, news from it may be sent to the spinal cord, and hy the spinal cord to the brain, and this is done if anything goes wrong with either of these departments that requires the help of the will. For instance, we know that if any one says anything unkind or rude to us we feel hot all over and blush." The words enter our ears, and are carried by their nerves to the brain. They cause thoughts. The impression is received by the spinal cord, and passed on by the spinal cord to the sympathetic system. For a moment or tAvo the nerves are paralysed or become limp, as it were ; their control over the blood-vessels has gone, and the blood gathers in the vessels and makes the skin red. In a similar way a great sorrow will upset a person's digestion, because it ^Y^\l affect the nerves, which will act through the sympathetic system. In many ways it is known that the imagined daughter —IMiss Sympathetic—can have easy access to the brain in case of anything unusual occurring; for though we are not generally conscious of our heart beating or of the blood flowing by, if they go on in the usual way, yet should the heart beat too fast we know that we have palpitation, or should the blood stop we feel without looking that we are blushing. But, on the other hand, Father Brain has not absolute power over Miss Sym- pathetic's departments, for however much Ave may Avill, Ave cannot make our blood go sloAver, or decide Avhat Ave shall or shall not digest. You must not, hoAAxver, think that the sympathetic system is independent of the spinal cord. Xo, both are closely connected. Indeed, AAuthin the bony box of the spine are a special set of nerA^e cells from AA^hich the sympathetic fibres proceed; but their exact relation is too difficult and complicated for you to understand until your brain cells are bigger and their tails more vigorous, but if you Avork hard and conscientiously they Avill cer- tainly become so.

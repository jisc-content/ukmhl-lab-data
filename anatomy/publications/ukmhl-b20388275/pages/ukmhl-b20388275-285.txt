SUMMARIES 281 CHAPTER XLIL—THE JOURNEY OF THE BLOOD, Is the size of our fist. Contains four chambers— H I Two on the right side. Two on the left side. < I Each top chamber has a door leading to the lower chamber. H ' Auricles.—The two top chambers. W I Ventricles.—The two bottom chambers. W I Eh Hight Auricle.—Fills with blood—twelve tablespoonfuls. \ Bight Ventricle.—Receives the blood from right auricle. Three ( Opens and lies flat to let blood into the ventricle. Flap Valve 1 Floats on the top of the blood when ventricle is OR Tricuspid ) full and thus prevents more blood entering. Valve ^ Attached by little cords to the walls of the heart. The Blood /Rosses through both auricle and ventricle every \ three-quarters of a second. The Lung and / Receive the blood from the right Pulmonary Arteries I ventricle. CHAPTER XLIIL—THE JOURNEY OF THE BLOOD. g / Is a thick strong pipe; has 3 coats— W I Outer coat—strong and rough. < Middle coat—composed of muscles, and is elastic. I Inside coat—elastic, and lined with soft skin. ^ V Sub-divides again and again till becomes capillaries. f Are all over the body. Are very tiny. Capillaries Have very thin walls. tBlood flows slowly through them. The LUNGt f Divides into two smaller arteries— Artery \ One going to left lung. One going to right lung. f These also divide and subdivide until PULMONAEY ARTERY. | ^^^^ ^^^^^^ capillaries. rAre in among the air-cells, and everywhere else. J Use—To carry oxygen into and carbonic acid out of CAPILLARIES^ the blood. Course of JFlows from the right ventricle into the lung artery. THE Blood. \Groes back to the heart by veins. !Travels fast in the arteries. Travels slowest in the capillaries. Travels quicker in the veins.

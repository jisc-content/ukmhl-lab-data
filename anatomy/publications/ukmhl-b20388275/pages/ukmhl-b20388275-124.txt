THE MAKING OF THE BODY 120 his stomach a great deal of meat, they could not secrete enough juice to melt it, and so it lay there hard and undigested, and the pain he sufifered was what is called indigestion. If people eat quite different food from what they are accustomed to, they should eat very little of it. A great deal of this digesting fluid {gastric) is secreted —so much that I am sure it will surprise you to hear the quantity; for never less than ten pints, and sometimes as much as twenty pints, are poured into the stomach every day. If we could see it as it leaves the hundreds of little hags, hottles, or glands, it would look much like clear water, and a large proportion of it consists only of water. But it also has something in it which influences certain sorts of food that have been eaten. The details of these changes is too difiicult a subject for you. When the stomach has done its work the food is changed into a substance called Food-Paste {Chyme). The food-paste {chyme), once made, is immediately ready to leave the stomach, so it goes to the gate on the left- hand side of the picture, in order to get out.

In front of that gate we will now leave it, carrying it in the next chapter to still further foreign, or to it lui- known, regions.

156 THE MAKING OF THE BODY The Windpipe {Trachea) is a tube about ^ of an inch wide and 4J inches long. It is made of strong round bands of cartilage. Hoops, I was going to write, but then I remembered that hoops went all round a thing, and that if I said hoops of cartilage you would think they went all round the tube or windpipe (trachea); but they do not. These bands go only across the front and a little way round each side of the windpipe (trachea), but they do not go across the back at all. Look at the picture and see what I mean. There is a very good reason for this plan. As you know, cartilage is hard and firmâ€”indeed, sometimes it is very strong and unresisting. At the back of the windpipe, lying almost close by the side of it, is the gullet (oesophagus), down which the food travels. Here is a picture to explain to you the position of both the wind- pipe and the gullet. When food is going down, the gullet is ex- tended; it moves and be- comes bigger if an unusually large mouthful is pushed on- wards. Then the windpipe (trachea) po- litely gives way to it. It bends inward as it were, and gracefully removes itself out of the way of the gullet (oesophagus). This it is able to do all the more easily because it has no stiff, hard cartilage going quite round it. The portion that has to yield to the gullet is the back part where there are no complete bands.

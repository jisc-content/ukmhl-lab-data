THE SPINAL cord's MESSAGES 81 cells. Now here is a picture showing how the nerves go all over the body. Yon will notice how thick is the nerve trunk {spinal cord) and how tiny are some of the nerves that go into the fingers, and toes, and face. Many as there are in this picture, there are yet thousands more than can be shown here. CHAPTEE XIX. THE yOURNEY OF THE SENSATIONS. THE SPINAL CORDâ€”ITS MESSAGES AND COMMANDS. You will remember that you were told that when any part of the body was touched, the carrying-to (afferent) nerve carried the message that it was touched to the brain. I did not then stop to tell you by which road the carriers travelled, but now you must learn that they first had to get between the bones of the spinal column, right into the very centre of it. Once there, up they rushed till they reached its thick end, the oblong Marrow (medulla oblongata). Through that they sped until they arrived at the brain, gave their news, and found the carry- ing-from (efferent) nerves, awaiting to receive orders from the brain. That was the road they took ; but I hope some one will be wondering how the little postmen got into the spinal cord. If so, now is the time for wondering to cease and knowledge to begin. The Spinal Cord is the continuation of the oblong marrow (medtdla ob- longata). In grown-up people it is about eighteen inches long, and almost as thick as one of their middle fingers. It is covered with the same coverings as the brain, but F

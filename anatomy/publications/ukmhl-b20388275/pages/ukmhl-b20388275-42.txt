38 THE MAKING OF THE BODY wanted to bend, move freely, or yield easily. Suppose we make a little experiment. Let each child stand straight upright, hold the book with the right hand, and lay the left hand on the chest, ^sow let every one draw a deep long breath. The chest will rise and then sink. Each of the ribs has moved as the breath was taken. The back-bone has remained steady, but the cartilage that joins the ribs to the Breast-bone (ster?ui))i), being flexible, has allowed the ribs to raise themselves so as to give the wonderful lungs that lie beneath them more room to work. People often break their ribs. Sometimes the accident is very dangerous : sometimes it is soon cured. It all depends on which rib it is that is broken, and whether the broken bits of ribs stick outwards against the skin or turn inwards against the lung or heart. CHAPTER YIII. THE BODY BASIN OR THE PELVIS. In the last chapter we likened the ribs to the hoops round a barrel; to-day we will learn about the sides of the barrel of the body. It is called the pelvis, and is something like a basin in shape, but is bottomless. A queer basin," you will say; and so it is. And it is something more than a basin. It is also a bridge and a box. Now turn to the picture on page 33, and notice that at the bottom of the back-bone there are five of the bending bones or vertebrse all joined together. They form one solid bone, ending with a short bone that sticks out by itself. This solid bone is called, as you have already learned, the Sacrum ; it forms one of the four sides of the pelvis. On each side of it is A hip bone {ilium). You can easily feel them if you put your hands on

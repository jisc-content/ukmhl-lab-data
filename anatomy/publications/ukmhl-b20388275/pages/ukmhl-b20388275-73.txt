69 THE BIG BRAIN AND ITS CHAMBERS If at this moment some one were to tread on your toe, you would at once move your foot. Perhaps, if you wanted sympathy, or were very much hurt, you would make a wry face. If you thought the some one had trodden on you purposely, you would be inclined to push him away or hit him; and if you thought he had done it carelessly, you would tell him to be careful; or if you were unkind or un-Christian, you would perhaps abuse him and be rude to him. Will it surprise you very much to learn that the big brain (cerehrum) and the oblong marrow (inedulla oblongata) have both been at work to enable you to do or feel any of these things % Your toe is trodden on. It itself could not feel any- thing, but at once the brain {cerehrum) is told that your foot is hurt, and in your brain you feel the pain that is in your foot. Directly that part of the big brain (cere- hrum) which is called the sensory portion learns that your foot is in pain, a message is sent from its middle portion, which is called the motor motion, to bid the foot move; for it is in this portion that Ave will to move, and thereby set in motion the voluntary {stri- ated) muscles, about which you have heard a few chapters back. Down the oblong marrow {medulla ohlongata) goes the message. The foot is accordingly moved, but a message goes back again once more, through the oblong marrow {inedulla ohlongata) to the sensory portion of the brain to say the pain goes on. In the intellectual portion arises the thought— " I must show that I am hurt." From it to the motor portion goes the message— Contract the muscles of the face." The message is sent to the face, the muscles are moved, and a wry grimace is made. That done, a new idea occurs in the intellectual portion, namely— " Hit the person who trod on your foot." Quick as thought," we say, and it is a good expres- sion, for along some nerves the force travels at the rate

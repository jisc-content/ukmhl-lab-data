WHAT ARE GLANDS? 103 3. The Under-the-tongue Glands (Sublingual) are easily to be seen. The next time you look in the glass, if you open your mouth and put your tongue over your upper lip you will see that membrane. One gland is on either side of the little skin bridge that joins the tongue to the lower jaw. From these three pairs of glands, as well as from those of the mucous membrane, there pours forth a great quan- tity of the liquid called spittle {saliva). It is difficult to decide how much is made in the day, but a learned man called Dalton has made a calculation, from which he tells us that an ordinary healthy person, eating a fair amount of both sorts of food, will secrete from one to two pounds a day. All this saliva has three usesâ€” 1. To make the food wet. 2. To make it stick together. 3. To turn into sugar the starch of the food. Starch is found in beans, peas, potatoes, rice, corn, and maize. Thus we see that directly the food goes into the mouth it begins the changes that have to go on till it becomes part of the human body. She is small, but then she has not been long born," was the comfort given to a mother who was anxious because her child was so small. " Not long born, ma'am ! Why, she is six months old !" explained the woman. What do you feed her on?" was next asked. ^' Milk, corn flour, or a little ground rice pudding, and a bit of mashed potatoes sometimes." " JSTo wonder she is not well grown then," returned her friend, " because all these foods are starchy. The spittle glands {salivary) do not begin to work until a child is five or six months old, and it is they who begin the work of turning starchy foods into blood."

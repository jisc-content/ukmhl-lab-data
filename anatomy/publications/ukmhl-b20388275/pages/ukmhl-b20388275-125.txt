THE STOMACH GATE 121 CHAPTER XXX. THE yOURNEY OF THE FOOD. FOOD-PASTE (chyme)—THE GATEWAY (PYLORUS)—THE 12-INCH PIPE (duodenum). In the last chapter we left the food-paste (chyme) waiting in the stomach ready to go through a little door, which is called Cca^te (Pylorus). It does not swing on hinges or rise as if on rollers, like some of the other doors in the body. It is a different sort of door, and opens and shuts as a mouth does. When it is shut it is all jDushed up together, like your mouth is when you are going to Avhistle. When it is open it is round, like your mouth is when you yawn. Generally this gate (pylorus) is kept shut; but when the food-paste (chyme) is ready, or thinks itself ready, to go through, it j)ushes against the gate and asks to be allowed to pass on. The gate is kept shut by a round muscle called A Tight Band (Sphincter). It is the duty of the gate (pylorus) to let the food- paste (chyme) through, and it opens readily to do so; but if the food is not quite as fine a paste as it should be, the tight band (sphincter) draws together, and the gate (pylorus) contracts, or takes the shape of your mouth when a whistle is coming out, and the food-paste (chyme) is not allowed to go through. Back then it must go into the stomach, and be churned again by the actions of the muscular coat, until the paste has been made still finer and smoother, and fit to go through the little gate (pylorus) and past its sensitive walls.

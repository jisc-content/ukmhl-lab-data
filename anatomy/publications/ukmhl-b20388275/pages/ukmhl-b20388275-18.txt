THE MAKING OF THE BODY 14 Have you ever seen any delicate machine ? I once went over the Mint at London, where the coins are made, or ^'struck," as it is called. It is very important that each coin should weigh exactly what it is said to weigh, and so every sovereign, and shilling, and sixpence, or threepenny-bit is put into the scales before it is sent out on its way in the world, to be paid in wages to some worker, or to buy goodiesfor some child. The machine where the sovereign is weighed is most beautiful. It is so delicate that even changes in the wind or a shower of rain affect it, so it has to be kept under glass. Through a narrow hole in the glass case a sovereign is slipped in by another dainty machine. It stands for a moment on the scale; then if it is too heavy, even one hair's weight too heavy, it is tipped off on one side, and goes back again to the fire to be melted down and made all over again. If it is too light, it gets tipped off on the other side. If it is just right, it passes on to a bowl to join the other sovereigns that are exact and fair, and is then all ready for use. It is a wonderful machine, every part perfect, every part clean, every part doing its own work and depending on the other parts. But wonderful as it is, it is not so wonderful as the human body. The mechanism by which the heavy coin is turned on one side, the light coin sent to another, and the right one pushed forward, is not so delicate or so beautiful as the mechanism of the eye, by which we see colours, tolerate strong light, or get used to dull atmosphere. All the machinery that ever was made is not so com- plicated as the arrangement in our ears by which we hear sounds, or the contrivance to carry those sounds up into our brains, by the aid of which we know whether the sound we hear is baby's cry, if we have left it alone too long, or the clear song of the blackbird, who is sing- ing in his own language of his happiness.

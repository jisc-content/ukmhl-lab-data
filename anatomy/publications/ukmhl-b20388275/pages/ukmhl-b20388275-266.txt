THE MAKING OF THE BODY 262 the light waves, bring them to a point. In so doing they cross, and the image becomes topsy-turvy, and forms a little picture. Fig. 113.—Figure showing how the image of a Candle is seen upside down after passing tiirough the crystal Glass (Crystalline Lens). Are you near-sighted I am," said one lady as she chatted over her tea at a working-party. "JSTo ! I am long-sighted, and can enjoy views how- ever distant," said the other. What did they mean ? They meant that in some people the eyeball was too long. In that case the little picture was formed too far in front of the wonderful net- work (retina), and it all got blurred. These people are called near-sighted. In other people the eyeball is too short to allow of the picture being properly formed, and so the retina cannot do all it should do—these people are called long-sighted. Several times we have talked of the eyeball. You have heard of its coats—many in name and material— but you have not heard of it itself. Perhaps some one will say— *'I thought it was made up of all the coats." So it is, and yet it is not. It is made up of the coats, and yet underneath them all is a centre—a kind of kernel. This is called The Grlassy Water (Vitreous Humour). In Fig. 112 it is shown to you quite clearly. It is large; indeed, it is the largest of all the many parts of the eye. It is made of a kind of jelly, and is very soft. It is clear. The images of things pass through it quite easily.

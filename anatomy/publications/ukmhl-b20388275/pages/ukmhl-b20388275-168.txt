THE MAKING OF THE BODY all the little air cells which are waiting empty for it. They are close together, and look like the little holes in a sponge. Now you will know why I said that the lungs look both like a tree and a sponge. They branch out as a tree branches, but at the end of each of the tiniest of the twigs is this little arrangement of air cells which makes them look like a sponge. So far, then, we have followed the air. Do we leave it in the air cells ?" Yes and No." " Yes " because some of it is left there, and ^^No" because some of it returns by the same way as it entered into the outside air, changed though, quite changed by the work it has done while it has been in the lung.

All around these bronchial branches and twigs are hundreds, nay, thousands, of little tiny blood-vessels. They have very thin walls; indeed, they are so thin that what is inside them can pass through them. Are these not strange walls 1 They are thick enough to keep all they wish to keep inside them—they are thin enough to allow all they wish to go to pass through them. Through these walls of the tiny tubes goes the fresh clean air. Through the walls of the little blood-vessels go the impurities that are in the blood. To the blood the air gives its purifying strength. From the blood the air takes all that which makes it dirty and unfit for health. Now you will see why it is im- portant always to breathe fresh air, for it is only fresh air that has the power to clean the blood and make it fit to do its work of feeding the organs and sustaining life.

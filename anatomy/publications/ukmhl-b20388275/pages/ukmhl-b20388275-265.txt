261 THE EYE TUNIC wonderful muscles which I told you were buried in among the folds of the hairy coat {ciliary process). These muscles are fastened, not to the crystal glass {crystalline lens) itself, but to a little tunic that it wears. It is a clear tunic, clear like the glass itself, and may be called The Tunic {Capsule). A most important duty has the crystal glass. In the last chapter we left the light waves just coming through the round window {pupil). Directly they have passed through it they reach the crystal glass {crystal- line lens).

Because she had no teeth the food was hurried out of the mouth before the spittle (salivary) glands had had time to change it, as they ought to have done, and so the sweet- bread (^'pancreas) had to do the left-undone work. It had to secrete more pancreatic juice, and pour more than nature rightly bade it to do through the little tube which you will see quite clearly marked leading to the 12-inch pipe {duodenum) in the picture on page 124.

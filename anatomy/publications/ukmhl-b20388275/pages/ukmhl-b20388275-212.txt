208 THE MAKING OF THE BODY In olden days gentlemen wore stockings and knee breeches, which they buckled on with smart buckles. You will see them in museums. Some are made of gold or silver, while I have seen others beautifully decorated with coloured enamels, diamonds, or precious stones. The buckle bone gets its name from this fashion or dress, for it lies immediately below where the smart men fastened their smart breeches. You will remember that there is an arrangement in the arm to enable the hand to turn. This does not exist in the leg. The buckle bone {fibula) is fastened to its twin both at the top and bottom, and the shin bone is joined to the ankle at one end, and to the thigh- bone [femur) at its opposite extremity. During one holiday my husband and I drove about lovely Cornwall. We had a small two-wheeled cart, so near to the ground that we could jump out to pick the wild-flowers or drink of the clear brooks. Our pony was old, but was believed to be sure-footed. The hills are very steep in Cornwall, and one day when we were descending an unusually steep one, the old nag slipped on a loose stone and fell with a crash. " He has broken his knees, I fear," said my husband, and he hastily got out to see. " Poor beastie !" I said, " I hope not." We will hope it is only the hair, but I am afraid it is more-â€”it was a heavy fall," I got as a reply. However, we found he had done neither, and was only so vexed and annoyed at finding himself tripping that he sulkily objected to rising. When it is said of a horse, ''He has broken knees," it only means that the hair and skin are broken; but if the words are used of a human being, it is a much more serious matter.

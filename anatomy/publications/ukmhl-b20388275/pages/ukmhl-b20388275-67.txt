THE BRAIN COVERSâ€”OUTSIDE THE SKULL 63 vessels. From it are created little fr(^sli new (jells. Each new one pushes the older one forward as a new one is created, and this new one in its turn becomes an old one as a still new^er one comes into being, and these little cells make new hair. So you see the hair near the end is the old hair; the hair near the head is the ne^v fresh young hair. The Shaft {or Stem) of the hair is the part which we all see.

Is it not a strange custom ? The second covering of the skull is called the Scalp. There is but little need to pause over the scalp, for you have already read something about the skin, fat glands, and the muscles, and when thfese form the scalp they are not essentially different than when elsewhere. But I should like you to carefully study the picture (Fig. 25), from which you wdll see how the hair roots and the grease {sebaceous) glands lie in amid the fat cells, sweat pores, sweat glands, and sweat ducts. I have seen these Ked Indians in their own homes in Canada, if one can use the beautiful word home for their miserable tent huts. One man called "The Mountain Bull" was pointed out to us, who boasted that he had got the scalps of fifteen men in his tent. I do not know if it was true, for these savages know but little more al)out

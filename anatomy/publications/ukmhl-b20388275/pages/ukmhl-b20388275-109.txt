THE TEETH lOS at all exposed to the air. Over this is another substance It is very hard, brittle, and white, and has no blood- vessels. If, therefore, it becomes chipped or damaged, it does not grow again, and the softer dentine, without its coat of harder enamel, soon falls ill, decays, or rots. If you look at the picture you will see that before the two fangs divide, and below the enamel and dentine, is a cavity called The Pulp Cavity, which is filled with Tooth Pulp. Tooth pulp is a mass of nerves and blood-vessels. Each tooth, then, not only consists of three parts, but each one is composed of three different substances, namely, Dentine, Enamel, Tooth Pulp. The enamel is the coat or sheath, and it is the part that we should be most careful to preserve from injury or decay; for if you break the enamel and let the air into the dentine, it decays. While it is decaying we feel little or no pain, but directly even a little hole is made right through the dentine, which allows the air or spittle or food to get into the pulp cavity, the pain begins, be- cause the nerve is reached, for, as you have heard, it is the nerves that have the wonderful power of carrying feelings of pain or pleasure to the brain. The enamel can be easily broken, scratched, or damaged. Cracking nuts, or biting hard things, or thread, will chip it; while sweet stuff, or goodies, make an acid that sinks through the enamel, hard as it is, and gets at it, from the inside. It is very important to have good teeth, and to keep them clean and healthy. "She would be very pretty, only she has such bad teeth," is more often heard of a girl than it should be; orâ€” " Yes, he's a nice boy, but he would be nicer if he used his tooth-brush," is a verdict given sometimes on boys. This is a pity, for a tooth-brush only costs a few j^ence, and to brush or clean the teeth merely costs a little trouble

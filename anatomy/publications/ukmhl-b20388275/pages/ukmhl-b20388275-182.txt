These two in their turn divide again into other branches, and they divide into yet smaller ones. The Lung Arteries [Pulmonary Arteries), j^iG. 76.—The Human Heakt from Behind. I, right ventricle ; 2, left ventricle ; 3, 3', and 3", the pulmonary arteries and their branches ; 4' and 4", the aorta; 5, right auricle ; 6 is placed on the division between the right and left auricles; 7, superior vena cava; 8, inferior vena cava; 9, hepatic vein; 10, u, and 12, right pulmonary arteries; 13 and 14, left pulmonary veins ; +, the coronary arteries. Smaller and smaller become the arteries as they twine in and out of the air passages about which we talked in the chapters on the lungs; smaller and still smaller

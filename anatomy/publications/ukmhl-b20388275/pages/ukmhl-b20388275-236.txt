232 THE MAKING OF THE BODY and to carry them towards those wonderful arrange- ments that enable people to hear, and about w^hich you are going to learn. You have all seen horses and dogs and donkeys prick up their ears. That is, they turn them towards the direction whence the sound proceeds in order to collect the sound waves and direct them down the passage, but we cannot prick up our ears. So the wing {pinna) is no good for that. It may be that they are only for ornament, or perhaps man used to have the power of moving his ears, only that now he no longer lives by the aid of his acute hearing, the muscles which are there for that purpose have fallen into the weakness of disuse. But besides the wing {pinna) the outer ear consists, as you know, of the passage leading inwards. It is about an inch and a half long, and you can get your little finger down it until it reaches some yellow wax. It is called The Hearing Passage {Auditory Canal). This passage is lined with some fine hairs that push anything out that may get in, and that gradually send the wax out also. This wax is made by some tiny glands situated about three-quarters of an inch down the passage. They secrete very slowly, and the wax is evidently meant to take care of what is beyond it. Shall we imagine that we are going to send a sound on its journey from the air to your brain ? Shall the sound be a note of music or a word ? If you decide it shall be a note of music, you must ask your teacher to sing it to you. If you wish the sound to be a word, let us take some big word like Duty—Patriotism^—Love— Mother—God—so that when it reaches our brains it may give them a good thought also. Shall we take the word Duty ? Your teacher says it. As it leaves the mouth the air vibrates. Have you ever thrown a stone into a pond ? Once, when I was a little girl, I was idly throwing stones into the duck-pond in our garden. Splash ! went the stone. Quack ! quack!" said the ducks, wriggling off as

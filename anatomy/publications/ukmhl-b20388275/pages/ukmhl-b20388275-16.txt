THE MAKING OF THE BODY 12 should die, as the engine does if the stoker forgets to feed it. The machine wants coal, coke, oil, and water as its food; we want three sorts of food, i.e.— Strength-giving food (carbonaceous), Flesh-repairing food [nitrogenous), Health-preserving food {mineral), and plenty of air and water as well. More about this I will tell you in another chapter. Now we will pass on to— II. The human body and the machine both throw off waste.—We have all seen the steam-engine puff off its clouds of steam, which roll away in beautiful wreaths and lovely shapes; and in the evening, when it is lit up by the fires beneath, it looks like an overhanging cloud of glory, leaving behind a trail of light, like a gentle memory. We have all seen this, and some of us have seen the stokers shovel out the clinkers, or fuel which has not been wholly burnt. Thus the engine throws off its waste. Human beings throw off their waste in different ways—by the perspiration of the skin, by the help of the kidneys and the liver, and by the breath. By various methods both machines and people alike must throw off their waste, or it poisons them and hinders progress. III. The human body and the machine both have to be kept clean.—Did you ever see a dirty machine ? One feels quite sorry about it. It works with such an effort; it wheezes and groans, jerks and splutters, and some- times breaks itself in its effort to go on before it runs down altogether and stops dead. It is sad to see an engine spoiled by dirt, but sadder still to see the beautiful human body inj ured for want of washing. But it often is. Bodies want washing inside and out. This can be done in various ways, but, on the whole, water is the best thing to wash with. Better than beer, spirits, or medicine for the inside; better than sand or oil for the outside. When we come to the chapter on the skin I will tell you why.

All sounds, as you know, travel into the ear by the same pathways. Rat-a-tat-tat " sounds the stirrup against the little opening, and into the entrance room (vestibule) go the sound waves.

So you see that it is the duty of the shell-tube (cochlea) to help to tell the brain about the pitch of a sound, and it is the duty of the ribbon loops (semicircular canals) to tell the brain about the loudness of a sound. What do they find inside the shell-tube? We will follow them and see. Shell Tube (Cochlea). Here is a picture of how its inside would look, but the picture does not show one - hundredth part of all its wonders.

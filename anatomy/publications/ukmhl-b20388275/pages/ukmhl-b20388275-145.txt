A LYMPHATIC TRUNK 141 on, and it continues its journey going along other lymphatic vessels, always kept in the straight path by the aid of the little bags or valves about which I told you in the last chapter. They will not allow it to return, and so on and on it goes till it reaches A Lymphatic Trunk. Here it meets with some lymph, which has arrived from other parts of the body by other roads. How closely we have w^atched the food. We have never lost sight of it since it was a bit of bread or meat in the mouth until it is in a lymphatic trunk. We have not missed one of its stages, though I have only been able to tell you very little about each of them. Its long journey and the changes it has undergone has now all but made it ready to join the blood and become part of it; but before it takes the last stage we will once more leave it, this time with plenty of room in the lymphatic trunk, while we go and try to learn something about The Lymph that I have just told you joins it in the lymphatic trunk. Before we start, though, I must tell you that you have two more sorts of lymph to learn about. " Two more sorts," did I say 1 Well, that explains it partly, but not entirely. It is truer to say that lymph is made of three materialsâ€” I. The fatty part of the food. ^ 2. The blood that is not wanted. 3. The worn out bits of the body dissolved. Already we have spoken of the food as one of the materials that makes lymph; but before we talk of the other two, you must learn about another set of pipes. I have told you about Lymphatic Trunks and Lymphatic Vessels, but you have yet to be told about Lymphatic Capillaries, what they are and what they do. Shortly, they are the

THE LUNG VEINS 183 First it has three coats like an artery— The outer coat {areolar tissue), The middle coat {muscular)^ The lining coat {epithelial), but each of these three coats is much thinner than those surrounding the artery. Here is a picture of a vein and its coats. The arteries have no pouches or valves, but veins have them, for the same reason that lymphatic ves- sels do—namely, to prevent the blood flowing back- wards. The blood which, in ima- gination, we have followed from the right top chamber {right auricle) of the heart, 78.-Transverse Section ^ \ , .

It is by this time a bright red colour, and full of life- giving force. Up and about the capillaries it wanders till all the work it had to do there has been done, and then it is drawn up by a little tiny vein, and by it it is conducted into a larger vein. If it wants to go back it cannot do so, the little pouch valves immediately fill and block the passage, so it has no chance but to go on, and on it goes, until it approaches near to the heart. By this time all the many veins have joined together, until there are only five—three come from the right lung, two from the left lung. They are called The Lung Veins {Pulmonary Veins), You will see them all marked in Fig. 76, on p. 178, if you study the drawing carefully. The three veins from one lung and the two veins from

THE LIVEE VEIN No ; it must have certain things done to it first. The liver is ready and fit to do what is required. So instead of the usual course being taken, the capillaries take this rich blood to some special veins, and these veins join togfether into one vein called The Portal Vein, and by this all the rich blood is poured into the liver. Inside the wonderful chambers of the liver it is worked up until it is more like the blood in the other veins which has come from the head, or the leg, or the arm, or any other part of the body. Then, when it is ready, it leaves the liver by another vein called The Liver Vein {Hepatic Vein), and finally joins the other blood in one great vein, not the one of which we have already spoken several times, the superior vena cava, but the inferior vena cava. On the next page is a picture which will show you some- thing about this system of circulation, which is called The Portal Circulation. To make this quite clear, we will put down the stages of the portal circulation as we did those of the lung (pulmonary) and whole system (systematic) circulations. From the great artery {aorta) Into the smaller arteries. ^ From the smaller arteries Into the capillaries which go round the stomach, pan- creas, spleen, intestines. From these capillaries Into many veins. From many veins Into one vein called the portal vein. From the portal vein Into the liver—where changes occur. From the liver Into the liver vein [hepatic vein). From the liver vein [hepatic vein) Into the inferior vena cava. From the inferior vena cava Into the heart. You may have heard people say— " Ah ! poor man, he is bilious, his liver is out of order. See how yellow he looks."

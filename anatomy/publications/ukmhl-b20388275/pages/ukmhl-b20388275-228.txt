224 THE MAKING OF THE BODY CHAPTEH LIII. THE yoURNEY OF A WORD, THE VOICE-BOX {lARVNx). One of the great differences between human beings and other animals is that the former talk, the latter are speechless, though all, or nearly all, of them make some sound. The beautiful instrument that enables mankind to speak is called The Voice-Box {Larynx), It is placed immediately at the top of the windpipe, indeed, it may be said to be the enlarged top of the windpipe itself. There are two pictures of it on page 225. To understand this picture you must recall the facts about the two first bands of the windpipe. The top one is named the shield ring {thyroid). You can see the front of it in any boy's throat. It pokes out, and is then called Adam's apple. Where it got this funny name I can't say, but I have heard that it was so called because of an old legend which says that Eve ate her apple, enjoyed it, swallowed it, and thought no more about it, but that a piece of Adam's apple stuck in his throat, and so this queer cartilage, which looks like a three-cornered bit of apple, got called Adam's apple. It goes but half-way round the windpipe. Standing immediately above it is a small bone called ; The U-Shaped Bone {Hyoid), It is easily found in the picture. The second ring {cricoid) is, as you will remember, the ring that goes quite round the windpipe and refuses to move out of the way when the gullet requires more room.

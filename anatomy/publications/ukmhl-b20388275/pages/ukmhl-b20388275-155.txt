ON DRINKING TOO MUCH is given them, get overtired, and fail, therefore more has to go off in waste. If less food is given, the stomach and digestive organs are able to take all the good that there is in it and use it every bit. The Americans, the English, and the Germans eat more food than any other people. The Hindoos eat very little, and the Japanese hardly exceed them.

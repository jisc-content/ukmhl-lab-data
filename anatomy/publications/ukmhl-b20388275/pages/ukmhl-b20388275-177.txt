THE heart's CHAMBEES left hand side, but each of the top rooms has a door which leads to the bottom room that lies immediately below it. Once we were staying by the seaside in a house that was next door to another house which looked exactly like it. So much alike were they outside that some- times we made a mistake and went into the neighbour's house instead of our own. But once inside we soon found out our error. Outside both houses looked as if each had a room upstairs and a room downstairs, a door in front and a garden door ; but inside, though each house had an upstairs and a downstairs room, they were otherwise quite differently planned. Their doors were in different places and were used for different purposes. "That architect is a clever fellow," said my husband. " He knows what his tenants want, and has built accordingly." Now the heart is something like these two houses. Each has two rooms and various doors, but each is planned differently, and is used for different purposes. The heart, too, is like the two houses, inasmuch as no one could go from the rooms of the one into the rooms of the other. The rooms in the heart are called Auricles. Ventricles. Or if these two words are too hard for you to learn, you can call them heart rooms, but I should advise you to try and remember these terms. The top right room (right auricle). The bottom right room {right ventricle). The top left room {left auricle). The bottom left icoom {left ventricle). Into the top right room {right auricle) pours the blood. More and more goes in, until twelve tablespoon- fuls are packed into it. Then it flows through a sort of trap door, which is placed in the floor of the top right room {right auricle)^ and enters the bottom right room {right ventricle). Gradually this chamber fills, but before we can let it out I must tell you about how the trap door is closed when the bottom right room {right ventricle) has got as much blood in it as it can hold.

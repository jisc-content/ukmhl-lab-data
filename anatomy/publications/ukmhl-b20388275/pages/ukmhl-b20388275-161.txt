ADAM'S APPLE The top band of the windpipe (trachea) is called The Shield Ring {thyroid). It is wide in front and sticking out in an angle, forms what is known as Adam's Apple. Behind it is like the others, soft and open ; but the second ring is an all round band. Have you ever swallowed a very hard crust, or a bit of fish bone, or a bit of meat skin which stuck out and would not be rolled and chewed into a pill or soft ball ? If you have, you will know that you felt a pain at the top of the throat, which went off as soon as the too hard or too big mouthful had gone down beyond that particular place. Some people think that their gullet {oesophagus) is smaller at the top, near the throat, but that is not the case. The pain is caused by the hard mouthful passing The Second Ring {cricoid cartilage) of the windpipe (trachea); for as it is entirely round, there is no soft place, at the back, ready to squeeze itself out of the way when the gullet is wishful for more room. No; the second ring is a complete all round one, and is hard and strong. So when the over-big mouthful passes, it has either to push the cartilage band, or else to extend the gullet the other side. Both of which acts hurt, and that is why we have pain when we swallow anything which is too big or not enough chewed. Perhaps it has been arranged that the second ring {cricoid cartilage) of the throat should go all round, and be hard and firm, to remind us that we must not give the stomach pieces too large for it, or bits of unchewed food that cannot easily pass down the gullet. John, do not bolt your food; you will suffer from it one day,'^ was the advice given to a big lad of twelve one day by his mother " All right, mother," said the boy, " I'll wait till I do. This was neither a courteous nor a wise answer; for Nature is an unforgiving friend, and, sooner or later, John would suffer from having " bolted his food," and

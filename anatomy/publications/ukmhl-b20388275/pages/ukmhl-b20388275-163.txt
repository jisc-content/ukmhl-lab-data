159 THE AVINDPIPE'kS DOOK stood the news that food, or drink, or spittle was going to leave the mouth and enter the large chamber {pliarynx), or else if it understood it had not done its work. It had stopped one moment too long before slipping down and covering the glottis, and so the travelling food had taken the wrong turning. We come of a choky family," said a sweet mother lady to me the other day, while a strong boy of fourteen thumped a delicate girl hardly, but not unkindly, on the back, because she choked. If the lady had talked in scientific language, she would have said— " We come of a family where the epiglottis is not very sensitive/' but we should have thought it both odd and pretentious of her. The greater people are, the less they pretend or lay claim to knowledge. The over door (epiglottis) only shuts down when food is passing by, and generally it is open and admits the air quite naturally into the windpipe (trachea). But we must return to the air, and follow it as it journeys, much in the same way as we accompanied the food as it travelled along. It has to go down the windpipe {trachea) to the very bottom. If you have a cold, or if the air is very chilly, you will feel it as it passes right down the chest, exactly in the middle. At the end of the windpipe it divides into two tubes—one goes to the right hand side of the chest, the other branches off to the left hand side. These two pipes are called The Wind Tubes {Bronchi), and their work is to convey the air on towards the lungs. These two wind tubes (hronchi) are very strong and also very delicate. They in their turn divide and sub- divide, and as they do so they get re-named and are called The Bronchial Tubes. They, as well as the windpipe {trachea), the bronchial tubes, and all the branches down to the tiniest, are lined with a wet skin {mucous membrane).

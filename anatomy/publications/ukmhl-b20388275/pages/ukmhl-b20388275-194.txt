190 THE MAKING OF THE BODY will tell you in the next chapter, for I want in to-day's lesson to tell you of a brave boy who saved his sister's life by using his wits and the little bit of anatomy that he had learned. The boy was about twelve, and his sister some three years younger. They were out playing in a hay- field. The sun shone, the sky was blue, soft fleecy clouds floated overhead, and both girl and boy were having what the Americans would call *'a real good time."

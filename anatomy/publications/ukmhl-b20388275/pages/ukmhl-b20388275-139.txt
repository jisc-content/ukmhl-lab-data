HOW THE FOOD GETS INTO THE BLOOD 135 The gall-bladder is very sensitive, and as soon as the food-paste {chyme) enters the 12-inch pipe (duodenum) it gets news of it, opens itself, and outpours the bile which the liver has secreted, and which it—the gall-bladder —has taken charge of until it is wanted. Down the little tube the bile travels, and enters the 12-inch pipe (duodenum) towards its lower end. There it meets the food-paste (cliyme)^ which is, as you know, being churned from side to side. It joins it, and is soon mixed in so well that it would be difficult to know the two apart. ^'Mother says I am bilious, but I don't know what that means. Do you know?" asked a boy of his teacher. "Yes, my lad, I know," said his master, "but it is too difficult for you to understand." Is it too difficult for you, my pupils, or do you think you understand a little about what being bilious is? Anyhow you now know that it has to do with the liver, which makes the bile that is stored up in the gall-bladder. Sometimes biliousness is caused by the liver working too hard and secreting too much bile, and sometimes from other causes. The liver is easily influenced by beer or spirit drinking, and there are few diseases. more horrible than what is known as the drunkard's liver. I have only told you of a part of what the liver does. There are a great many other things that it does besides, but I do not know myself how it does them, so we must all wait until the wise men have found out about it and let us know. CHAPTER XXXIY.

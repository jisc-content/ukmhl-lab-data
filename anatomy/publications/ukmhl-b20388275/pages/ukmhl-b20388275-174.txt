THE MAKING OF THE BODY 170 bones, muscles, organs, and skin, he would find that it weighed about a tenth of all the rest of him put together. We will first speak of the blood fluid (liquor sanguinis). It is chiefly water, to which is added certain mineral salts and other matter. It is the part of the blood that has the power of clotting, or forming the sort of paste which, covering a wound, hinders further loss by bleeding. In this fluid float the white corpuscles. They are slightly larger than the red ones; and yet, when I say that, yon must still go on thinking that they are smaller than anything that the human eye can see. They are all sorts of queer shapes. If you had a very strong microscope, and were looking down it upon a drop of blood, you would say, as you caught sight of the white corpuscle— " It is the shape *of a pear.'^ And after another few moments you might add— " No, it isn't—it's like a ball; surely not ! it is square —now it has three corners *'—for all the while you were watching it, it would take new shapes as it rolled and tumbled about in the watery fluid. The duty of the white corpuscle in the blood is not fully known, but so far as has yet been discovered, it is thought that its work is that of a gobbling scavenger. I never heard of a gobbling scavenger,*' one pupil told me. How could any one eat the dust in the cart?" It is quite true that no one could eat house refuse, and yet to absorb some of the body refuse is the work of the white corpuscle; but what he does with it when he has got it, is so far undiscovered. There are undis- covered lands in the world of science, waiting for some patient and humble Columbus to find them out. The Red Corpuscle is very tiny. Supposing you wanted to make a pile of them an inch high, you would have to put 140,000, each one on the top of the other, before you could do so. They are round, as you will see in

138 THE MAKING OF THK BODY our old friends, the bread and meat, which have wandered far, and l)een luucli tumbled and tossed, and soTue of which finds itself, in the form of chyle, inside the tiny milk thread {lacteal) of a shagq;y hair (oillm). First it is ready to be again re-named, and this time it is to be called Lymph. Can it rest now, and have time to consider itself with its new name ? No ; it must not rest. Nature allows nothiui^ much rest wlion slie is at work, and the chyle, —which must now \)c calUnl lymph. It does not long remain there, it is soon called out of the mouth of the tiny milk thread (lacteal), and from there drawn into what is called A Lymphatic Vessel. This vessel is a sort of very lino tube, but it is not like other tubes, for it has inside it a wonderful little contrivance, which is, however, best explained by a picture. You must know that the ligure marked A is the picture of one of these vessels when laid Hat open, but that when it is ck)sed it will be round like a, little tube as we see in the figure marked B. Now, in each lymphatic vessel there are many little flat bags lying up against the side of the tube. When they are empty they are flat like the drawing on the right of Fig. 62. The lymph goes rapidly past them ; they lie low,'' and one might be in danger of even forgetting they are there, J^ut if any of the lymph by mistake wishes to flow the wrong way, or return to the little white milk threads {lacMah), then these little bags quickly iill; they bulge out and take yiG.6i.—Diagram showing Vai.vks.

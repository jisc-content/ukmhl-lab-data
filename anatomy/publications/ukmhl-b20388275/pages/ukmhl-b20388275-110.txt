I06 THE MAKING OF THE BODY and a few minutes, and all of these are well expended if they keep the teeth clean and from decay. When food is being taken little bits sometimes stick to the teeth, or remain clinging to the gums. This is uncomfortable, but sometimes small pieces get wedged in between the teeth so that they are not noticed, and then the aid of the tooth-brush is required to find them out and dislodge them. If any food is allowed to remain round the gums or teeth it decays and gives out a gas which in time injures the enamel and so the tooth.

" Ah 1 poor little dear," we hear kind mothers and nurses say, "he is trying to cut his teeth," by which they mean that the new teeth are being pushed outward through the gum. It is much better to help the tooth to come by Cutting or lancing the gum. A little hole is then made through which the tooth can easily push its way, and the strength of the little one can be used for growing and digesting its food, instead of being fretted away by a tiresome and niggling pain, which often makes the nerves ill and causes convulsions or fits. People are often afraid of lancing babies' gums, but now you know something about it you will be able to tell them that there is no need to fear to do so. CHAPTER XXVII. THE JOURNEY OF THE FOOD.

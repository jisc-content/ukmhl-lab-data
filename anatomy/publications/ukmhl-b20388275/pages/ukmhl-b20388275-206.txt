202 THE MAKING OF THE BODY CHAPTER XLYIII. THE ARMS, WRISTS, AND HANDS, The upper arm bone {humerus) has, as you know, two heads. The top head fits into the shoulder bone cup, its lower head fits on to two bones; the larger of these two is called The Spoke Bone {Radius). It is called this queer name because it is supposed to resemble one of the spokes of a wheel. It also, like the upper arm bone (liumerus), has two round heads. In its top head is a small shallow cup, and in this rests the lower head of the upper arm bone {humerus), which you see not only has two ball heads, but two cups in which to rest them. Its lower head is fastened to the bones of the wrist. The name of the second bone, which bears the upper arm bone {liumerus), is The Elbow Bone {Ulna). The elbow bone has only one head, and it fits into the lower head of the big bone above it by a kind of hinge, which is like the hinge of a door, and does not allow the bone to bend backwards. Try, and you will see that your arm will not bend backwards at the elbow joint. Now we will make a little experiment. Let one child lay his arm flat on a table, the inside touching the wood, but with the palm of the hand turned upwards. If we could suddenly skin that child and strip off his muscles, with all their marvellous arrangements of nerves and blood-vessels^ we should find the spoke bone {radius) and the elbow bone {ulna) lying side by side, the one straight with the other. Now give the order. *'Turn the hand till its back is outwards and the palm near the wood.'' He begins to obey. Let us see what happens. The elbow bone {idna) does not move, but slowly the lower end of the spoke bone {radius) turns round and

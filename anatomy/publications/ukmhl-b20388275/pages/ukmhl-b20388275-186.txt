THE MAKING OF THE BODY CHAPTER XLIY. THE JOURNEY OF THE BLOOD, THROUGH HAIR-LIKE PIPES, VEINS, AND THE HEART DOORS. In the last chapter we followed the blood as it journeyed through the big artery to the little arteries, and from the little arteries into the tiny hair-like pipes {capillaries). There we saw it give out its dirty carbonic acid gas, and take in the nice clean oxygen gas; and then, as I told you, it was ready ^' to begin its work of keeping alive and strong all the organs of the body," but first it had to go back to the heart. The blood travelled from the heart by an artery. The blood travels to the heart by a vein. How does it get from one to the other ? By the tiny hair-like pipes {capil- laries). They are the bridges between the arteries and the veins. Here is a picture. If you look carefully at this picture you will see that the capillaries branch off from the artery, twist in and out and round about, and then run into another vessel which is . f called A Vein. Now I must tell you in some ways it is quite Fig. 77. â€” Capillakt Blood- Vessels in the Web of a Frog's Foot, as seen with THE Microscope. a, small artery; 6, capillaries; c, small vein. The arrows show the course of the blood. that a vein resembles, but different from, an artery.

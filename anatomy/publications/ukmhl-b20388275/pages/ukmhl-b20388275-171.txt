THE LUNG BAG new air and some of the old air both go out together, leaving some of both sorts inside to do the work of blood purifying. " Oh, I shall die ! I can't get my breath !gasped a thin woman, as she was thrust by a kindly, but rather rough, railway porter into the train just as it was start- ing. And certainly she seemed to suffer a great deal. She gasped and struggled for her breath, while her face got quite purple in colour. We fanned her, and opened the window to give her air, and did what we could, and she slowly recovered. I ought not to run," she explained, when she got better. ^' The doctor told me I should never do it. I have had my lungs bad.'"' ^'Ah!" thought I, some of your air cells, of which you ought to have 600,000,000, have got closed by the cold or stuffed up by phlegm, and so you have not got enough room for the 250 cubic inches of residual air." Thus you will see all or nearly all that she had for the blood to use was the 26 inches of incoming air (tidal air). That was not enough; and so, in order to get more, the nerves in the lungs were told to carry messages to the oblong marrow {inedidla oblongata), to tell it to command the muscles to work harder and faster so that more air might be drawn in. This they did, which made the poor woman " out of breatf The blood-vessels could not take up all the oxygen which the dirty blood wanted while it was so hurriedly going to and fro, and so the blood had to remain impure, and that was why the poor woman looked purple in the face, for dirty blood is bluish before it is cleaned, and turned red by the oxygen in the air. Now we have followed the air from the nose to the air cells, and some of it we have left there; but before we say farewell to it I must tell you that the whole lung is enclosed in A Double-Bag Skin [Pleura). One side of the bag fits closely to the lung, the other side lies against the walls of the chest, while between

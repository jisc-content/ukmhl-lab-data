83 THE SPINAL coed's COMMMANDS which come through the back {posterior) holes that carry the messages about some sensation to the grey matter in the brain or spinal cord. Back (posterior) iterbes carrg nebs of sensation, JFront [anterior) nerbes carrg com- mands about mobcmcnt. Sometimes the carrying-to nerves are called sensory and the carrying-from nerves are called motor. You will see why.

Eapidly the carrying-to nerves \posterio7') took up the news to the brain. There it was received and immediately acted on. The carrying- from nerves (anterior) carried commands to various ]3laces. To the hands it sent the order—"Eemove your fingers from the bars." To the face—"Contort the features." To the mouth and throat—"Cry for help." To the feet and legs—"Step backwards." To the eyes—" See that your dress has not caught fire." All the news that the carrying-to nerves {afferent pos- terior) took was about sensation, and therefore they are often called sensory nerves. All the news that the carrying-from nerves {efferent anterior) took was about movement, therefore they are often called motor nerves.

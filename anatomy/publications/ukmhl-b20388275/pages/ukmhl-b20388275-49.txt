THE WILLING OR YOLUNTAKY MUSCLES 45 CHAPTER X. THE WILLING OR VOLUNTARY MUSCLES. I WILL tell you in to-day's lesson about The Willing {Voluntary) Muscles. These are very obedient; they always do exactly as we tell them. Sometimes they do things without our know- ing that we have told them ; but that is only because we have told them so often that they have got used to acting without fresh commands. I think it is a very beautiful fact, and it should help us very much to know that our wills can command our bodies, that even our fingers move because we order our muscles to move them. It should help us in times of temptation, for though it is true to say ''the flesh is weak,'' it is also true to say 'Hhe will is strongand as the poet has written it— " So near to glory is our dust, So nigh to God is man, That when Duty whispers, ' Lo ! thou must,' The soul replies, ' I can.' " The willing or voluntary muscles are of two kinds— 1. Bending muscles [flexor). 2. Extending muscles {exte7isor). Look at your hands. You are perhaps each holding a book in your right hand. If the fingers and thumbs are closed, and kept closed so as to hold the book, you are using the bending {flexor) muscles. Open your hand and pass the book to your left hand. Now you have used the extending {extensoi') muscles. Here is a picture showing the muscles of the hand which will help you. Both the bending {flexor) and the extending muscles {extensor) are voluntary. They obey your will. You wish and will that your hand shall close. The muscles inside it contract; the muscles at the back of the hand extend. The hand closes.

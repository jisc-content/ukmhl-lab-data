THE MAKING OF THE BODY 134 but which, after it has joined others, and become bigger, is called The Liver Vein {He^patic), You will see it in Fig. 57, exactly in the middle of the workshop (Johule), and marked with the figure i. Fig. 57.â€”Cross Section of a Lobule. Magnified about 60 Diameters. I, intralobular vein; 2, its smaller branches, collecting blood from the capillary network; ^, lobular branches of the portal vein, with their subdivisions passing inwards. Does the liver vein (liepatic) keep the blood ? ^sTo : it passes the blood onward until it reaches the largest vein in the body (inferior vena cava), which finally pours it into the heart. And now we must return to the store-house, where we shall find all that this industrious organ has made. It is called, as I have already said, the gall-bladder, and it contains the bile, and a great deal of it too, for every day no less than a pint and three-quarters is made or secreted by it. Secrete is the right word to use when speaking about glands.

THE liver's WOEK It allows nothing else but the bile to travel along it, and nothing ever returns by it. Its only use is to convey the bile, which has been made in one of the workshops, out of the over- rich blood, into the store-room—the gall- bladder. The liver is a wonderful organ, and it is both very useful and very industrious. Indeed, it never stops its work, for it has no "eight hours day,'' and neither does it cry out for playtime. It works on all day patiently, only doing a little more extra work as soon as the stomach receives fresh food, and slackening off a little when its owner is very hungry. But it never stops still. It cannot work so hard without being well fed, and the Fig. 56. — The food it requires is blood. ^ot dirty Gall Bladder blood, but fresh blood lately cleaned and . . SELS enlivened by the oxygen in the air. So the heart pumps towards it some of this bright red blood, which enters by the second of the doorways, which is called The Liver Artery (Hepatic). Once inside, this artery does the double work of feeding and removing. It leaves behind what the liver wants ; it takes away what the liver has done with. Fig. 57 will explain the shape of a lobule, or liver workroom, in which so much interesting work goes on. We have now seen that two sorts of blood enter the liver, each by its own door. The over-rich blood on which the lobule has had to work, and the fresh blood, which has had for its duty that of feeding this hard-working organ. After all the work is done, both sorts of blood want to leave the liver. But there is only one passage by which they can leave. So as both have to use it, they wisely unite. You are too young to understand all the wonderful mechanism by which they unite, but after they have done so they leave by the vein, which is then quite tiny,

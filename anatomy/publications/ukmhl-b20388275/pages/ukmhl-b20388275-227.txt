223 THE SMELI. CHAMBER I can't smell it," said a poor pale mite; " I have got a cold." "I—I—I shan't sniff, for I don't want tosm—sm—smell it," stuttered one ill-mannered boy. "You will lose a pleasure then, and punish only your- self," said a teacher who was there. But I expect you will want to know why people can smell more by sniffing in the scent. Let us try the experiment. Close your lips firmly and draw a long breath. All the air will be compelled to go through the nose passages, which will be fuller than usual, so more air will find its way into the smell chamber (olfactory) until it is full to the roof. On its roof are still more little nerves, and these are extra acute, so if the odour reaches them the brain hears still more about it. But cold prevents people from smelling. "My nose is stuffed up," they say, and it is true the cold makes the wet skin (^mucous membrane) swell and discharge so much that the opening into the smell chamber (olfactory chamber) is stuffed up, and the odours cannot get in, but have to pass on and out of the nose with the other air. " Ugh I I have swallowed a smell. It went right into my lungs," a gentleman said who had been to look at dustbins and drains to try and find out why so many children were ill in a certain alley. What he meant was that the smell had gone past his smell chamber (olfactory) into his throat chamber (pharynx) and down into his lungs. Alas ! it was too true. The tiny unwholesome par- ticles were picked up by the blood-vessels around his lungs, and he died ten days afterwards. And his is not the first noble life that has been sacrificed because people will not be clean and obey the laws which Moses gave to the Jews and to all others besides.

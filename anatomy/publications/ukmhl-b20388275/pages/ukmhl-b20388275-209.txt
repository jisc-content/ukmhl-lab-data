205 THE THIGH BONE The English have introduced many good things into India, among them the game of cricket. It is very curious to see black boys wearing very few clothes running with a ball and fielding as carefully as any English lad could do. They catch the cricket ball, and it goes " crack " into their palms, just as it does at home. Why does the blow not break the hand ? Because it is made of twenty-seven bones, and the many, each yielding a little, enable the hand to resist shocks, which, if it were only made of one or two, would break it to pieces. CHAPTER XLIX. THE LEGS. The legs and feet very much resemble the arms and hands; so, believing that you have studied the last chapter carefully, there will be no need in this one to dwell so long on the mere bones. When we talked about the body barrel (pelvis), I told you about the cup into which the ball of the leg bone put its head, and you also learnt that the legs were like the two piers of an arch on which the whole weight of the body rested. The name of this bone is The Thigh Bone (Femur). As people have two legs, they also have two thigh bones, one in each leg, but I will speak only of one leg, and you will know that what is true of one is also true of the other. The thigh bone (femur) is the largest and heaviest bone in the body. It reaches from the thigh to the knee. The ball head is bound into the cup by the strongest ligaments. This cup is not so shallow as the cup in which the big bone of the upper arm (humerus) rests, and the consequence is that the leg cannot move

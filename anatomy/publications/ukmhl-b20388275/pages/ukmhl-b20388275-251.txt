THE TEAR CANALS 247 CHAPTER LYIIL THE EYE WHAT WASPIES AND MOVES IT. We left the eyeball comfortably lying on its cushion of fat waiting to be washed. This is done by water which is made {secreted) by The Tear Gland {Lachrymal Gland). The glands you know draw out from the blood certain materials, and make them up into something else, and this something they put aside until it is wanted. The tear gland is one of these secreting glands. It prepares tears, and stores them for the use of the eye. "Are we then always crying?^' asked the happiest of happy little girls. " I did not know that. I thought we only cried sometimes when we could not manage things." Yes," said the teacher, "the tear gland is always at work making tears.'' These tears are the water that keeps the eyeball clean. The tear gland (lachrymal gland) is about the size of a small almond, and is placed by the eyeball on that side of it which is furthest from the nose. It makes a tear— or rather a bit of one—which runs down over and across the eye, washes it, and escapes into the opposite corner of the eye. From there it is taken by little pipes called The Tear Canals {Lachrymal) into another and a larger pipe {lachrymal duct), and by that into the nose. Sometimes when we are sad this tearful gland works harder, and makes so many tears that the tearful canal {lachrymal) is not large enough to carry them all away.

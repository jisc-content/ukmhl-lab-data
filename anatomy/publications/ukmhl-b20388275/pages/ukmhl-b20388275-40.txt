THE MAKIXO OF THE BODY 36 if you like to remember them by their scientific names, the A'ertebral Column and the Sternum. The two are joined together by The Ribs, which go round the body like the hoops of a barrel or a tub. There are twenty-four ribs in everybody's body— twelve on one side, and twelve on the other. They are curved bones, and are in pairs. One of the pair starts from one side of the back-bone: the other of the pair starts from the other side of the back-bone. They curve round and meet each other in the front of the body, where some of them, not all, are joined to the sternum or breast-bone. It would be much easier if each of the ribs started from the back-bone, and ended up with the breast-bone, or even if they each went all straight round like the V Vertebrae. > Gristle or ^ Cartilage.

If they did, we could just leave them, and not learn much more about them; bat, alas ! it is not so easy as all that, for, instead of being quite straight, they go a little downward.

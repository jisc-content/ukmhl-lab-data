41 THE BODY BASIN OR THE PELVIS could not then have two legs. The back-bone might be extended, and we should look like a snake or a fish, but legs would be impossible. Look at the picture of the skeleton and you will see my meaning. The pelvis is like the top of the bridge, the two legs being the two piers on which it stands. When we talked about the back-bone, I showed you that the lower vertebrae were larger, and heavier, and stronger than the upper ones, so as to enable them to bear the weight of those above them. For the same reason, the bones of the pelvis have to be strong, for on them the whole weight of the upper part of the body rests. The pelvis takes upon itself the weight of the back-bone, and all the back-bone bears—such as the head, the arms, the shoulders—and dividing it, gives it in equal shares to the two legs to carry. Mary, don't stand on one leg," I heard a woman shout as I was riding past her cottage. She spoke to her little girl, a pretty lassie, who was nursing a pretty kitten in a still prettier garden. I often admired the child, with her flaxen curls and graceful ways, but after a while I missed her from the garden gate, and on asking after her I found she was laid by with a spinal disease. The doctor says her leg has pushed up into her back," explained her mother, who had not learnt much physiology; but you, I hope, will see what had happened. Poor Mary had stood on one leg until the ball bone had pressed too hard into the cup {acetabulum) of the pelvis; that pushed her pelvis on one side, and curved the back- bone. The pelvis had done its duty in dividing the weight of the body between both legs, but she had made one leg do all the work.

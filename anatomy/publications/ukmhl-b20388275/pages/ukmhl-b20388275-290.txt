THE MAKING OF THE BODY 286 p fAre two bands of elastic fibre stretched from the front of the ^ o second ring {cricoid) to the back of the shield ring {thyroid). W If tight, they vibrate when touched by the air, producing sound. < When loose, the air passes through them, causing no sound. P \^They move in various ways. CHAPTER LIV.—THE JOURNEY OF A SOUND. The Ear—Has three parts—i. Outer. 2. Middle. 3. Inner. -^The part we see consists of two parts— I. The wing {pinna). 2. Hearing passage {audit07'y canal). Auditory Canal. —About i J inches long. Lined with fine hairs. Fine Hairs—Keep dust out of ear. Push out the wax. Wax.—Made by glands. Protects drum {tympanic membrane). {A thin muscular skin. Stretched tightly across hearing passage (auditory passage), and acts as wall between outer and middle ear. ^ Chamber which receives sound from drum {tympanicmembrane). S~\ Ear Pipe or f Passage from middle ear to the throat chamber § Eustachian^ {pharynx). g V Tube. I Carries warm air from mouth to the middle ear. Course of Sound—Enters wing {pinna). Goes down auditory canal. Through wax. Reaches drum. W H o CHAPTER LY.—THE JOURNEY OF A SOUND. [The hammer {malleus). The anvil {incus). The stirrup {strapes). Hammer/Lies close to the drum {tympanic membrane). {malleus)\'Use—to vibrate with drum. Anvil J Lies close against the hammer. {incus) yjJse—to vibrate with hammer. i g Stirrup J Lies close to anvil. ,M I {stapes) \Use—to vibrate with anvil. /^Has three parts— 1. The Shell Tube {cochlea). 2. The Ribbon loops {semicircular canals). 3. The Entrance room {vestibule). Clear Water f Clear water filling all three parts, in which floats {perilymph) \ tiny skin bag {membranous labyrinth). The Skin Maze i Contains water and ear stones {membranous labyrinth) \ {otoliths). Course of Sound—Touches drum. Vibrates hammer. Vibrates anvil. Vibrates stirrup. M I—I w w Eh

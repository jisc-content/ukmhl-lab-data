THE MAKING OF THE BODY 48 L.Point of Origin of the Muscle. The Belly of the Muscle, and is called the triceps. It is fastened to a bone below the elbow {the ulna). You will see it marked in the picture. At the same time that you tell the muscle in front of your arm (biceps) to extend, you command the muscle at the back of your arm {tricep)s) to contract. Both immedi- ately obey you, and the arm straightens. Each of the muscles that joins bones can be divided into three parts— 1. The point of origin of the muscle. 2. The belly of the muscle. 3. The point of insertion of the muscle. Here is a picture of the big leg muscle, which will show you the three parts, the point of origin being at the top. ^ . . . "What is a tendon?" you The Point of , Insertion of Will aSK, the Muscle. Nothing very difficult to understand; only that the muscle when it gets thinner and is attached to the bone is called a tendon. ^'A ten- don," as Professor Wilson says, " serves the same pur- pose as a rope to fix the muscle to that point of the bone from which it is intended to act." The point of origin is that part of the muscle which is joined to the bone by a tendon. The belly of the muscle is the large central part that gets large and thin as it contracts or extends. The point of insertion is the place where the big muscle joins the bones of the foot. Fig. 19.—The Leg and Foot, showing the muscles of THE Calf.

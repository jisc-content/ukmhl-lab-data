Let us in imagination take one of the bones of the backbone and look down into it. AVe should see a bit of Fig. 37.—Illustrating the Shape of the Grey Matter of THE Spinal Cokd. the spinal cord, and we should find that it would look sometlnng like it is drawn in Fig. 34.

As you know, the white matter are the nerve fibres, the carriers,

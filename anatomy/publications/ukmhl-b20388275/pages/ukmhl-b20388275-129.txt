THE SWEETBREAD 125 "You will get tired of carrying her/' said nurse. "You had better leave her at home." 'â€¢No, I shan't," I replied; "I never get tired of having her ; " and in my own mind I remember silently thinking, "If I do get tired, you will carry her." " Well, do as you like," said the kind woman. During the walk my arms ached with carrying the heavy toy. " Please, carry Minnie," I said to nurse. "No," she replied ; "I advised you not to bring her, and now you must carry her." " I won't," I said in a rage; and I sat the doll in the hedge and left it. On we went, I very uncomfortable, and nurse very firm ; but at last she gave way, went back, fetched the doll, and carried it herself. She was like the pancreatic juice, and picked up what another had neglected. It w^ould have been much better for me to have carried the doll. It would be much better for the teeth and spittle glands (salivary) to do their own work ; but when they do not, the kind nurse, sweetbread {jpancreas)^ works to make up their neglect. It is better fof every reason that the spittle (salivary) glands should be made or allowed to do their own work, which they will do if the food is chewed enough, and kept a sufficient time in the mouth ; but if through carelessness or necessary haste the food is swallowed too quickly, the sweetbread (^pancreas) will have to work extra hard to make up for the neglect of the mouth glands. It is a pity that this should ever be the case, for overwork of glands, as well as of people, is likely to produce illness. You will now be able to understand another reason why the old lady of whom I told you in the last chapter got indigestion. Because she had no teeth the food was not chewed enough, and so the stomach and its glands had to work harder. Its muscles had to work till they were weary and ached from fatigue: its glands had to secrete more juices, and pour out more and more liquid to melt the unchewed food, until they were limp and weak with weariness.

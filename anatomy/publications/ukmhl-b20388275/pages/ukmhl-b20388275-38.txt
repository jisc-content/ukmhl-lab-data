34 THE MAKIXG OF THE BODY one another both in shape and in use. It would be too difficuk for you to learn all the differences, but you can just notice how their bodies get larger as they get down. Look how small is Xo. i of the Xeck Bones {cervical vertelrct^) compared to Xo. 5 of the Loin Bones {lumhcir vpii^^hr(t^). The lower ones are bigger and stronger, to enable them to bear the weight of those abov-e them. Again, you all know how rapidly and easily you can move your neck. You can turn your head from side to side, hold it up or down, lean it backward, or drop it till the chin totiches the chest. That is partly because the neck bones {cerv/raJ verfehrcp) are so many and so small, all seven only occupying a little more room than three of those of the big loin {lumbar vertehrce). The back cannot be moved so readily as the neck can be turned. Some people's backs are much more lissome than those of others. Yott will all have seen the people in the circuses, how they bend their backs till they can put their heads on the ground, or how they tie their legs around their necks. CHAPTER YIL THE BREAST-BONE OR STERNUMâ€”THE RIBS. To DAY, children, you will learn about The breast-bone {sternurrt) and The ribs. Every one has a little hole or dent in front of the throat. If you put your finger on it and j^ress it you soon feel a difficulty in breathing. Xow ptit your middle finger on this place, and let your hand rest on your chest; your wrist will then just about reach to the end of your Breast-bone {sternum). Its top is made of spongy or cancellous bone, btit the bottom is hardly bone at all ; it is made of gristle, or what is called cartilage.

THE SHAGGY HAIRS Here is a picture of two very much magnified. In the centre of each of the shaggy hairs {villi) is a small white tube. This is called A Milk Thread {Lacteal). Sometimes a shaggy hair (villus) has one milk thread {lacteal), as you will see is the case with the left-hand villus in the picture.

It is a delightful pleasure to see things that are quite new, to meet people that are hitherto unknown, and to experience pleasures or sensa- tions that are fresh.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 74 it? How does our brain know, even when we are asleep and our Avill is not working, that the coverlid has fallen off, or that some one has touched our hand ? The brain knows because the nerves have told it; and now I will try and teach you something about your nerves, what they are and what they do. We will speak to-day about Nerve Fibres. If you were to see a nerve, it would look something like a bit of fine white cotton, but if, after a person is dead, you could see one of his nerves through a magni- fying-glass, it would look, not like one bit of cotton, but many. Each thread would appear something Hke a very tiny glass tube filled with oil. Did you ever see one of the big cables by which the ships are fastened to the piers ? If it is cut, or broken, you will see that although it is only one rope, it really consists of many strings or strands, as they are called, each lying side by side, and then twisted together. Some- thing in this way is made the telegraph cable, through which the messages go under the sea to America and the Colonies. *'But the telegraph cable is something more than strings or strands ?" Yes; sunk deep amid the strands of the cable or rope, well covered up, is the wire by which the message is sent. A nerve is something like a telegraph cable, for it is made of a bundle of nerve fibres, and each of these nerve fibres is composed of three partsâ€” a. The Central Part {Axis Cylinder), , J). The White Substance surrounding the Central Part. r. The Sheath of Swann surrounding the other two parts. The Central Part {Axis Cylinder) is a very tiny pipe. It is so small that you could not see it without a micro- scope, but it contains a sort of fluid.

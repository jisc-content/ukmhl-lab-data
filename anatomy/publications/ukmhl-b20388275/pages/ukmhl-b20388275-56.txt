THE MAKING OF THE BODY 52 like horses without reins. It is the horses with the reins that can be pulled and made to move when we will. It is the muscles with the stripes which can be pulled by one's will and made move when we will. Yery useful are these wilful servants, for though I have given them this name they will only do what is right and helpful. CHAPTEK XII. THE HEAD AND ITS BONES, Everybody knows that the head is one of the most im- portant parts of the body. It contains the brain, and it is also the seat of most of the senses. The ears by which we hear, the nose by which we smell, the eyes by which we see, the tongue by which we taste, are all parts of the head, while on its front side is situated the mouth, through which the body takes in food, air, and water, which enable it to repair itself and also to grow. The head is divided into two parts— The Skull {cranium). The Face. The skull {cranium) is the long box which protects the brain, and it consists of eight bones. Their names are a little difficult, but the j)icture will help, and you must make up your mind to learn them. The chief bones of the head are— I. The Forehead [Frontal Bone). 2 and 3. The Partition Bones [Parietal). 4. The Occipital Bone. 5 and 6. The Temples [Temporal Bones). 7. The Wedge Bone [Sphenoid). 8. The Sieve-like Bone [Ethmoid). You must now try and imagine a box with a bottom and a top to it, and four sides, but no square or right angular corners.

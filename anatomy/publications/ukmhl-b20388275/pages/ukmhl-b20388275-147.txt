THE LYMPHATIC CAPILLARIES H3 Do not take more than you can carry." But if we have learnt the lesson, a great many of the organs within our bodies have not done so, and they, like the greedy sailor, often take more blood than they want, or than they can use. But they are not left alone like the sailor. He was punished because he had not called his companions to share the good things he had found, and they, after looking and waiting for him a long time, naturally thought he was dead, and sailed on in their journey.

In this way its journey is just like that of the chyle, though it comes from a different source. The refuse blood, then, is the second material from which lymph is made. We have yet to speak of the third material, which is the worn out bits of the body dissolved. Everything or everybody that works wears,'' and this statement is true of the tissues and organs in the body. As they do their work they wear away. The waste must be got rid of.

As the waste substances are collected they make the same journey as the chyle did, and the same journey as the superfluous blood did. Indeed, from whatever

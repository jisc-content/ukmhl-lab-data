HAIK-LIKE PIPES 179 as they divide and subdivide, until they are no longer called arteries, but Hair-like Pipes {Caioillaries). Capillaries are very very tiny. They have only one wall, and that is so thin that all that there is in them can pass out, and all that is outside them can pass in to them. In them the blood goes much more slowly. This you will be able to understand if you have ever seen a stream enclosed within narrow banks. Then it was deep and rapid, but perhaps a mile or two lower down it spread out into a shallow lake, and then it moved slowly. I once learnt this fact by an interesting experience. "We were driving in California, but we found after we had gone a long way— over forty miles—that we could not reach any house in which to sleep unless we forded a river, as the usual road was broken down. The river was deep and rapid. It made two glorious waterfalls, as it leapt down nearly 2000 feet over the great rocks of the Yosemite Yalley, and then hurried on over its narrow and stony bed. We stood before it and wondered what to do. The horses, well trained and strong as they were, refused to face it, so rapid and noisy did it seem. The driver told stories of sad fates that had befallen people who tried to urge horses to face rivers of which they were afraid. We could not ford it there, so we turned back and wandered down the stream till it divided into three smaller streams. Here we crossed, stopping after having waded through one branch to rest the horses before we urged them to ford the other. The water came almost to the top of the horses' backs, but still the stream was much less strong and rapid than it was higher up before it was divided. The next day we returned to the place again, and found that a mile lower down the stream it was divided again into still smaller channels, and that through them the water was moving quite slowly and gently.

THE JOURNEY OF A SOUND weighed just 14 lbs. Now air being so heavy, you can imagine that if its waves were very rapid or strong they might beat too hardly against the thin skin that is stretched so tightly across the ear passage, and that it might break. Indeed, the very weight of the air itself might easily break it unless there were something on the other side to support it. The best thing to support the air pressure is other air. So it is arranged that air should be brought up to the other side of the drum of the ear (tymjpanic membrane), and then the 14 lbs. on every inch should press as much one side as the other, and so neither side would feel the weight. The use of the ear-pipe (eustachian tube) is to bring the air from the mouth, all nice and warmed, to the middle ear. ^^How does the air get to the inside of the drum of the ear ?" I asked a girl to whom I had been telling some of these marvels. By the other ear," she quickly answered. Then she was laughed at, and you will think she deserved it, will you not ? CHAPTER LY. THE yOURNEY OF A SOUND. THE HAMMER THE ANVIL THE STIRRUP. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat " played the air waves against the drum of the enr {tympa7iic membrane), and went through it. Yes, it is true to say that the air waves went through it," but that is not all the truth. Leaning against the drum skin are three bones called The Hammer {Malleus), The Anvil {Incus). The Stirrup {Stapes).

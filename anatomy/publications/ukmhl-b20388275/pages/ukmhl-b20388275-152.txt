THE MAKING OF THE BODY 148 spirits, stimulates and vet fatigues these and other of the internal structures. The liver is especially influenced by alcohol. Among its delicate tissues the spirit plays havoc, and many of the sad diseases of this organ are brought about by people drinking liquids containing alcohol. Sometimes it is taken to help digestion, by which is meant the process of melting or changing solid food into a liquid. But if we go to a museum we shall see lots of little bottles full of liquid, in which are dead but solid animals. What makes them remain solid ? why do they not melt into the liquid ? you ask. The answer is that the liquid is spirit, and it prevents them from dissolving, and this is the same sort of spirit, or alcohol, which people put in their insides, with the mistaken idea that it will help the solid food to dissolve. How mischievous,'' writes one doctor, is the drink- ing of alcoholic drinks, particularly during meals ! How absurd the popular, but too often medical delusion, that they assist or promote digestion ! *' And two wise professors, who wrote a big book, declare that, were it not that these drinks quickly left the stomach, it would be impossible for the stomach to do its work of digestion. But besides alcohol there are other foods which are unwholesome. Sometimes one hears people who are not very rich say they are " too poor to afford much meat.'"' If they knew more about physiology, they would not feel so sorry about this : but this is a large subject, and must be reserved for the next chapter.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 96 lie evenly on the top of the true skin (dermis), but that the true skin (dermis) ran up into the upper skin (epi- dermis) in little loops or hillocks which contained the wonderful nerves and blood-vessels. These little loops are called Hillocks {Papillce). 1^0w the hillocks (^papillce) of the tongue are much larger and also differ in other ways from those of other parts of the skin. There are three kinds :— 1. The Thread Hillocks {Filiform Papillce), 2. The Mushroom Hillocks {Fungiform Papillce). 3. The Rampart Hillocks {Oircumvallate Papillce). Each of these kinds of hillocks look different from the others, and has different uses and objects. We will begin by showing you a picture of— I. Thread Hillocks {Filiform Papillce). As you will see, and as the name shows, they are thin and thread-like in shape. They run up into the upper skin {epider- mis), and carry the blood and nerves with them. These thread hillocks {filiform papillcB) are jDlaced all over the tongue, but towards the tip of it there are hardly any other sort of hillocks. To them is given the power of tasting both sweet and salt things. You have often heard people say—''Ah ! she has such a sweet tooth. This sounds as if the tooth had the power of tasting, but this is not the case. It is those little thread hillocks which have that power; and if any one has a "sAveet tooth," it means that he has more of these thread hillocks on his tongue than most other people. If you could suppose that some one had all these thread hillocks on his tongue destroyed, he would not be able to taste salt. You might give him a whole S230onful, and yet it would only seem to him like a tasteless powder in his mouth. Did you ever give a dog a lump of salt just for fun, Fig. 41.—The Thread Hil- locks.

THE MAKING OF THE BODY 40 You will remember that the bone \Yhich makes the cup into which the leg ball fits, is large and heavy—larger, indeed, than your closed-up fist. Instead of continuing thick and heavy round the fourth side of the basin, it divides into two bones. Both together they form the front of the pelvis, but oue is rather above the other. The bone that is above the other, and also sticks out furthest in front, is called the pubis. The bone that is below the other and lies rather behind it, :s called the ischium—both difficult words, I fear, but there are no easier meanings to them. Now you know something about the four sides of this queerly shaped basin. The pelvis is a box. All our vital organs—and by Fig. 14.—The Front of the Pelvis. vital I mean those on which our life depends—are put into boxes,—bone-boxes. The heart and lungs are protected by the ribs. The spinal cord, which has to do the great work of connect- ing the body with the brain, is well wrapped up. It goes through the tunnel of the spine, just like the string went through tlie reels of cotton {s}jincd con^ flirougli vei'ft'J>ral coJumu). The brain is protected by a very strong bone-box; and the pelvis, about which you have been learning to-day, is the bone-box which protects many delicate organs. But, besides its use as a box to protect organs, the pelvis has another use. It distributes the weight of the body. Let us suppose there was no pelvis. We

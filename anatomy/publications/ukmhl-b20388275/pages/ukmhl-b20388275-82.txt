78 THE MAKING OF THE BODY in the picture you will see how the tails of the nerves stick out, and how vigorous and alive they look. If you saw a picture of these same nerve cells when they were weak, yon would see the tails drooping, and the centre 23art would seem limp and flabby Many learned people have tried to find out where memory, thought, and will dwell in the brain, but it has not yet been discovered, though it is generally believed that the brain cells, and the condition of their tails, have something to do with all three. Have you ever had a long illness? If so, you will know how, after it, not only your body feels weak, but your brain seems useless and incapable. I can't understand it," you say. 1 could have done so before I was ill, but now I can't." '^^>rever mind," says the kind friend who is tending you; '4t will come back to you." If the explanation was given, it would mean that the brain cells and their tails were weak and could not work, either to carry facts, or to create thoughts about the facts. When people get old the cell tails wear out, and then they are apt to forget. It is no use," you will hear an old person say. I can't recall it now, though time was when I knew it well." His brain cell tails are worn out, and can't carry the memory stores; but sometimes it will come to him ^'in a flash " long after he has left off thinking about it. That may be because the tails of those brain cells that are not worn out have been set to work, and at last have succeeded in hunting ""out from a brain cell the memory he wanted. This picture will shoiy you how certain brain cell tails could in this way help other brain cells which have had their tails worn out or injured. As you will see, the tails interlace and touch each other, and so the idea that could not pass from one cell because its tails are feeble or worn out is sometimes able to use the tails of other centres, and travel along them.

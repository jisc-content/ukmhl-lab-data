THE JOURNEY OF THE BLOOD E <=> § a Let us put down the stages of its journeyings :- From the large upper vein {superior' vena cava) and the large lower vein [inferior vena cava) Into the heart's top right room [right auricle). From the top right room {right auricle) Into the bottom right room [right ventricle). From the bottom right room [right ventricle) Into the big lung artery [pulmonary artery). From the big lung artery [pulmonary artery) Into the smaller arteries [lesser pulmonary arteries). From the smaller arteries Into the hair-like pipes around the lungs {capillaries). From the capillaries [after picking up oxygen and dis- gorging carbonic acid) Into pipes with valves called veins [pulmonary veins). From pulmonary veins Into the heart's top left room [left auricle). I From the top left room [left auricle) Into the bottom left room [left ventricle). From the bottom left room {left ventricle) Into the great artery [aorta). From the great artery [aorta) Into the smaller arteries, which go into the head, arms, legs, body, &c. &c. From the sm.aller arteries Into the capillaries. From the capillaries [after disgorging oxygen and picking up waste) Into the veins. From many veins Into two veins called— The large upper vein [superior vena cava) The large lower vein [inferior vena cava). j You will see that on the right hand side of the page I have put brackets and divided the circulation into two branches. One has to do with the lungs, where dirty blood is made clean. The other has to do with the whole system, where clean blood is made dirty. But there is yet a third circulation.

444 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. Insertion.â€”By muscular fibres into the anterior half of the external lip of the iliac crest. By its aponeurosis, which unites in the middle line with the opposite muscle (as well as all the other lateral abdominal muscles), to form the linea alba, extending from the ensiform to the symphysis. By a dense band of the aponeurosis, which extends from the anterior superior spine of the ilium over the femoral vessels to the spine, iliopectineal line, crest and front of the pubes. The portion of this band attached to the spine of the pubes is Poupart's lig'ament, the reflection to the iHo- pectineal line is G-imbernat's lig'ament. The Linea Alba. Fig. 89. Diag. 29. This is the fascial junction of all the lateral abdominal muscles in the middle line from the ensiform appendix to the symphysis pubis. A gap is left between the fibres of the external oblique over the spine of the pubes, through which passes the sper- matic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female. This is the external abdominal ring- or opening*. Figs. 89 to 93. The outer border of the ring is formed by Poupart's liga- ment, the inner, by the fibres of the aponeurosis passing to the front of the pubes ; these borders are called columns. In order to strengthen this weak spot in the abdominal wall these columns are bound together by fibres passing at right angles to them, and extending outward to near the anterior superior iliac spine. These fibres constitute the intercolumnar fascia. From the lower part of the inter- columnar fascia and the margins of the ring a thin membrane descends upon the cord ; this is the external spermatic fascia. It is these structures that close in the gap between the separated fibres of the external oblique and effectually

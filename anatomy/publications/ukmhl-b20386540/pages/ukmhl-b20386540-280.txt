278 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. along the upper border of the pectoralis minor, {b) The acromiothoracic. This arises as a short trunk from the front of the axillary, just above the pectoralis minor, pierces the costocoracoid membrane, and breaks up into three or four sets of branches ; the humeral (descending), which accompanies the cephalic vein into the groove between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles ; the acromial, usu- ally a branch from the above, to the region of the point of the shoulder ; the thoracic, two or three branches to the chest and pectoral muscles ; the clavicular, often from the thoracic to the subclavius muscle. Second Portion.—(a) The alar thoracic. There may be one or several alar arteries, and they may arise from the axillary or from the neighboring branches, usually from the long thoracic. They supply the glandular and adipose tissue in the axillary space, {b) The long thoracic is given off from the inner side of the axillary behind the pectoralis minor, passes along the lower border of the same, and is distributed to the pectoral muscles, side of chest, and mammary gland. Third Portio7i.— {ci) The subscapular, the largest branch of the axillary artery, arises from its inner side just above the lower border of the subscapularis muscle, passes down- ward and inward to the chest, lying in the angle between the subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi muscles, and terminating in the serratus magnus muscle. About one inch from its origin the artery gives off the dorsal artery of the scapula (dorsalis scapidce), a large branch (really the continuation of the subscapular) which winds backward around the axillary (outer) border of the scapula to its posterior surface. It passes through the triangle formed by the subscapularis, teres major, and long head of the triceps muscles. For rest of course see page 371. (B) The anterior

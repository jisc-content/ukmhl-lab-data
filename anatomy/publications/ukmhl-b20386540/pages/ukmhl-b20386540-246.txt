A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 244 an unnecessary refinement of description into seven other lobules. The cerebellum is connected to the rest of the brain by three pairs of nerve-bundles, or peduncles : the superior, middle, and inferior. The middle peduncles have already been referred to as the great transverse commissure or the pons, which unite the two hemispheres of the cerebellum in front of the fibres of the crura cerebri. The superior peduncles are flattened bundles which project backward and outward from the testes of the corpora quadrigemina to reach the cerebellum internal to, and in front of, the middle peduncles. The superior peduncles are united across the median line and from the posterior margin of the quadrigeminal lamina to the front of the under surface of the cerebellum by a thin sheet of white matter called the valve of Vieussens, or the superior medullary velum. A tongue-shaped pro- jection—the ling'ula—from the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum rests upon the posterior part of the velum. An extension of some fibres from the valve of Vieussens forward between the posterior pair of quadrigeminal bodies is called the frenulum veli. The inferior peduncles of the cerebellum connect it with the lateral regions of the posterior part of the medulla. They are formed of the fibres from the direct cerebellar tract, the internal and the external arciform fibres, and go under the name of the restiform tracts. They enter the cerebellum internal to and behind the middle peduncles. On sections of the cerebellum the peculiar arrangement of its white matter within the gray gives the appearance of a branching tree, hence the name of arbor vitse which is applied to it.

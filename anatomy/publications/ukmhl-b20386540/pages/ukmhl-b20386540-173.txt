173 THE BRAIN. axis of these masses lies anteroposteriorly. The most anterior (and external) mass of cells becomes the adult corpora striata, the posterior (and internal) mass, the optic thalami. These masses are at first separated from each other, but as growth goes on they become united along their opposing surfaces. Furthermore, the primitive corpus striatum is separated from the lateral wall of the brain vesicle, but as development proceeds the two approach and finally fuse, but this Hne of junction is always a weak spot in the brain. Along this Hne of junction the lenticulo- striate artery passes, and that this line of junction is a weak spot is proven by the fact that cerebral hemorrhage takes place here from this artery more often than at any other point. The effused blood separates the apparently united corpus striatum from the vesicular wall. The fore part of the interbrain which unites the fore- brains of opposite sides is called the lamina terminahs. By the extension of this backward along with the growth of the forebrain and by the development in it of fibres which connect the forebrains, the great median commissure— corpus callosum—is formed. The portion of the lamina beneath the corpus callosum is projected backward in the shape of cylindrical bundles of fibres which are called the fornix. Between the fornix and the corpus callosum the lamina terminalis persists as a triangular shaped, very thin layer of brain matter, which helps to separate the two lateral ven- tricles and is called the septum lucidum (pellucidum). Within the septum lucidum by a process of vacuolation a cavity is formed which in the adult is called the fifth ven- tricle. It has no connection with the other ventricular cavities of the brain which are developed from the original cerebrospinal canal.

The large anterior portion in the anterior horn is the head of the caudate nucleus ; its body corresponds to the body of the ventricle itself, while the tail of the nucleus is its slender prolongation into the descending horn. The nucleus thus describes almost a complete circle and shows two cut surfaces in horizontal or vertical transverse sections. The Lenticular Nucleus.—Is the lower and outer— extraventricular—portion of the corpus striatum. In horizontal section it is biconvex in shape and faces inward and outward ; in vertical-transverse section it is triangular or wedge-shaped, with the base of the wedge abutting on the central lobe; in vertical anteroposterior sections its outline is oval with its lower part reaching to the base of the brain (at the anterior perforated space). The lenticular nucleus is separated from the caudate nucleus by a sheet of white fibres—the internal capsule— which bounds it on the inside. There is a similar sheet of white fibres bounding the nucleus upon its external surface called the external capsule. The two nuclei are not en- tirely separated by the internal capsule, as will be seen on study of a series of anteroposterior sections, but they be- come continuous with each other around the anterior margin of the internal capsule ; they are also connected by numerous fibres which pass through the anterior limb of the internal capsule.

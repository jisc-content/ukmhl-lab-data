A MANUAL OF AAA TO MY. 134 Within it are found the suboccipital nerve, the vertebral artery, and their branches. Its floor is formed by the pos- terior arch of the atlas and the occipito-atlantal ligament. Obliquus Capitis Superior. Fig. 19. Origin.—From the upper surface of the transverse pro- cess of the atlas. Insertion.—Into the occipital bone between the outer halves of the curved lines. Nerve Supply.—The suboccipital. Action.—To extend and slightly flex the head laterally. Obliquus Capitis Inferior. Fig. 19. Origin.—From the side of the spine of the axis. Ijtsertion.—Into the lower, posterior surface of the trans- verse process of the atlas. Nerve Supply.—The suboccipital. Action.—To rotate the atlas and head upon the axis ; to slightly flex the atlas upon the axis. Rectus Capitis Posticus Major. Fig. 19. Origin.—From the spinous process of the axis. Insertioit.—Into the middle third of the inferior curved line of the occipital bone. Nerve Supply.—The suboccipital. Action.—To extend the head upon the neck when both act; when one acts, in addition to the extension, it rotates the head to the same side. Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor. Fig. 19. Origin.—From the side of the tubercle upon the posterior arch of the atlas. Insertion.—Into the inner third of the inferior curved line of the occipital bone, and the depression anterior to it. Nerve Supply.—The suboccipital nerve. Action.—To extend the head.

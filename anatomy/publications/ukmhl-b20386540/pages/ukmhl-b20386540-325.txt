THE THORAX. 323 artery, and lower portion of the superior vena cava (all within the pericardium); the phrenic nerves* and their accompanying arteries ; the azygos vein (termination) ; the roots of the lungs and some bronchial lymphatic glands. The posterior mediastinum is that portion of the space between the pleurae laterally, the pericardium and roots of the lungs in front, and the spine (below the fourth dorsal vertebra) behind. It contains the descending and thoracic aorta, the oeso- phagus, pneumogastric nerves, azygos veins, thoracic duct, and lymphatic glands, sympathetic cord, ganglia, and splanchnic nerves. Structures which traverse the superior opening of the chest:— Muscles.—Sternohyoid, sternothyroid, longus colli. Arteries.—Innominate, left common carotid, left subcla- vian, internal mammary, superior intercostal. Veins.-—Left innominate, right internal jugular and sub- clavian, inferior thyroids, and superior intercostals. Nerves.—Phrenics, pneumogastrics, cardiac, sympathetic cord, recurrent laryngeal. Other Structures.—Thymus gland, thoracic duct, trachea, oesophagus, apices cf lungs, pleurae, cervical fascia. DISSECTION. If the pleurae have been preserved whole, remove the presenting portion. Trace the phrenic nerves and save the arterial branch (very small) that accom- panies them. Carefully dissect away the areolar tissue in the superior and anterior medi- astina, exposing the remains of the thymus gland, the great vessels, and pericardium. ThePleurse. Each pleura is a closed sack containing a lung, over which it is reflected, passing into the fissures. This reflec-

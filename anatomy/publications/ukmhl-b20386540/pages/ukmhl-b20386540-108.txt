A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 108 The artery terminates on both sides of the body at the lower border of the first rib, where the name for the arterial trunk becomes the axillary. The artery is divided into three portions by the scalenus anticus muscle. The first portion, internal to the muscle ; the second, behind, and the third portion external to the muscle. The right artery is three inches, the left about four inches in length. Relations.â€” First Portion of the Left Subclavian Artery. (Inserted here to complete the description of the artery.) In front: Sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and sternomastoid muscles. The left pleura and lung. The left innomi- nate vein. (In the neck), internal jugular, vertebral, and sub- clavian veins. Phrenic nerve (in the neck), cardiac nerves (from sympathetic). Thoracic duct (root of neck). Behind (and internal) : (Esophagus, thoracic duct, sym- pathetic and inferior ganghon, longus colli muscle, and spinal column. Behind (and externally) : The lung and pleura. At the right: Trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, and thoracic duct. At the left: Left lung and pleura. Right Subclaviafi Artery, First Portion. In front: Skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep fascia (two layers), the clavicular origins of the sternomastoid, sternothyroid, and sternohyoid muscles. The subclavian vein, the beginning of the innominate, end of the internal jugular and vertebral veins. Pneumogastric and phrenic nerves, the sympathetic cardiac branches. The artery is surrounded by a loop of the sympathetic, called the ring of Vieussens (annulus Vieussens). Behind : Longus colli muscle, transverse process of the

A MANUA L OF ANA TOMY. 338 tion of the under surface of the arch is opposite the articu- lation between the first and second portions of the sternum. From its upper surface it gives off the innominate, left com- mon carotid, and subclavian arteries. Relatiojis,—In front, pleurae and lungs (in inspiration), left phrenic and pneumogastric and cardiac nerves, and the left superior intercostal vein ; behind, trachea, oesophagus, thoracic duct, deep cardiac plexus, left recurrent laryngeal nerve ; above, its three branches and the left innominate vein ; below, left bronchus, bifurcation of pulmonary artery, left recurrent laryngeal nerve, remains of ductus arteriosus, some lymphatic glands. The Descending" Aorta. Diag. 22, This continues the arterial vessel from the ending of the transverse aorta (see above) to the level of the lower bor- der of the fifth dorsal vertebra, where it becomes the thoracic aorta. Relatiojis.—In front, left lung and pleura covering it; behind, left side of the (third), fourth, and fifth vertebrae ; at the right, oesophagus, thoracic duct, and the above vertebrae ; at the left, lung covered by its pleura. The Thoracic Aorta. Diags. 22, 23. Figs. 72, 74. Is the continuation of the aorta from its descending por- tion (see above) along the front of the dorsal vertebrae to the twelfth, where it leaves the thorax by passing through the aortic opening in the diaphragm into the abdomen. At its beginning it is a little to the left of the middle line, but at its ending is over the middle line. It is one of the constituents of the posterior mediastinum. Relations.—In front, root of left lung, oesophagus, dia- phragm ; behind, the dorsal vertebrae from the fifth to the twelfth inclusive, vena azygos minor (at the seventh or

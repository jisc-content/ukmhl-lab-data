THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 477 downward to become the descending" colon. This bend is the splenic flexure. At this point the transverse mesocolon is seen to be continued to the under surface of the tenth rib, forming the costocolic ligament or the sustentacu- lum splenis, as it supports the spleen. The descending colon is covered like the ascending, front and sides, the peritoneum at the right passing into the left lower surface of the mesentery, to the left, to line the lateral abdominal wall. In both the posterior surface is usually bare ; this allows the bowel to be entered from the back without opening into the general peritoneal cavity. The large loop of intestine following the descending colon is the omega loop, or the sigmoid flexure. It has a dis- tinct mesentery about three inches long and the same width. This allows the gut to hang free in the pelvic cavity. When the hollow of the sacrum is reached the peritoneum passes around to cover in the front of the rec- tum, descending to a point about an inch above the level of the tip of the coccyx, then reaches upward, covering in the back and sides of the bladder until its top is attained, from which point it is continued on to the anterior abdomi- nal wall. The cavity between the rectum and bladder is the rectovesical fossa. The peritoneal folds formed around the rectum and bladder are termed the ligaments of those organs. In the female the condition is altered by the interposition of the uterus and vagina between the bladder and the rectum. Posteriorly the peritoneum reaches as low as the upper part of the vagina, anteriorly only to the lower part of the uterus. The hollow behind the uterus is the rectovag*inal fossa, Douglas's pouch, the one in front of it the utero- vesical. Laterally from the uterus the peritoneal folds

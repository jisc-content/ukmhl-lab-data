65 THE HEAD, ANTERIOR. anguli oris to the lower lip, and runs inward between the mucous membrane and the orbicularis oris. It anasto- moses with the opposite coronary artery and the arteries below. (4) The superior coronary. Takes a similar course along the upper lip. It supplies the upper lip and gives off the artery of the septum of the nose. (5) The lateral nasal artery. This is a small (sometimes a large) branch to the side of the nose. It anastomoses with the nasal from the ophthalmic, and with the facial branches adjacent. (6) The angular artery. The last portion of the facial along the side of the nose. It terminates at the inner angle of the eye by anastomosing with the nasal branch of the ophthal- mic. The facial anastomoses on the face. As already stated, the facial branches toward the middle line freely communicate with each other. They also anas- tomose with the artery next above and below (excepting the coronary arteries do not anastomose with each other). The other connections are, with the temporal, by the mas- seteric and buccal branches uniting with the transverse facial; with the internal maxillary, through the inferior labial and coronary joining with the mental (of the inferior dental), by the muscular branches to the masseter and buc- cinator from both arteries, and through the infra-orbital ; and with the ophthalmic by its nasal branch anastomosing with the artery of the septum, the lateral nasal, and angular branches of the facial. DISSECTION. Cut the parotid gland away piecemeal, finish the facial nerve ; the upper portion of the external carotid artery and its terminal branches, the temporal and internal maxillary arteries; the transverse facial artery and posterior auri- cular arteries ; and the temporomaxillary vein or sinus. 5

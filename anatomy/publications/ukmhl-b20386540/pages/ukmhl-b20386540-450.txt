448 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, joined tendon arch over the spermatic cord (or round liga- ment). In the angle between the external and internal oblique muscles is seen the cord (or round ligament) resting upon Poupart's ligament, and disappearing under the arching fibres above mentioned. The space occupied by the cord or round ligament is the ing'uinal canal. (Fig. 91.) The same remarks apply to this canal that were made in reference to the abdominal ringsâ€”it is not a canal except when made such by a hernia or by the dissector. It is a " potential" canal. It extends from the internal to the external abdom- inal rings, a distance of one and one-half inches. The floor is formed by Poupart's ligament, upon which the cord is seen to rest. In front is the aponeurosis of the external oblique ; behind, the conjoined tendon, internal oblique, and fascia of the transversalis (will be seen later). Above, at outer part, the muscular arch of the two internal muscles. As the cord is examined, it will be found covered with detached loops of muscular fibres, which are reflected upon it in gradually lengthened festoons as low as the testicle. These muscular loops constitute the cremaster mtiscle^ and with the connective tissue binding the loops together is known as the cremasteric fascia. The cremaster mus- cle is usually described as detached portions of the internal oblique. Some fibres no doubt come from this source, and some from the foetal structure called the gubernaculum. See page 460. The cremaster is supplied by the genitocrural nerve. There is neither cremaster muscle nor fascia in the female. The ilio-inguinal nerve (Fig. 92) can be traced from where it passed through the external ring, upward and out- ward until it disappears through the internal oblique and transversalis. It lies close to Poupart's ligament.

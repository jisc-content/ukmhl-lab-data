A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 106 as it is entering the chest at the root of the neck. The right nerve passes to the deep cardiac plexus and the left to the superficial cardiac plexus. See page 354. For the remaining branches of the pneumogastric nerve see page 342. The Cervical Sympathetic Cord and Ganglia. Figs. 12, 18. There are three cervical ganglia, the superior, middle^ and inferior, joined by the nerve cord which extends from the base of the skull into the thorax, where it is continued as the thoracic cord. The sympathetic cord lies upon the rectus capitis anticus major and the longus colli (separated from them by the prevertebral fascia), and behind the inter- nal and common carotid arteries. The pneumogastric nerve lies external to the cord. The Superior Cervical Ganglion. This is about an inch in length ; it lies in front of the transverse process of the second and third cervical ver- tebrae. It gives off the ascending branch, which passes upward with the carotid artery and forms the carotid and cavernous plexuses ; the arterial branches to the external carotid and its branches ; the communicating filaments to the ninth, tenth, and twelfth cranial nerves; pharyngeal branches to the pharyngeal plexus ; the superior cardiac nerve, which on the right side passes to the deep cardiac plexus and on the left side to the superficial cardiac plexus (see page 354); and slender filaments to the anterior division of the first four spinal nerves. The middle cervical ganglion is not always constant ; when present is found in front of the inferior thyroid artery as a slight thickening of the cervical cord.

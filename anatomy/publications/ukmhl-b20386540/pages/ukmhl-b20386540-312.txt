310 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. Nerve Supply.—From the ulnar, by its deep palmar branch. The filaments arising from the eighth cervical nerve. Action.—See Dorsal i7tterossei. The Deep Palmar Arch. Diag. 18. Fig. 67. After the radial artery has gained the front of the hand by coming through between the first and second metacar- pal bones, it turns inward between the adductor and inner head of the flexor brevis poUicis, and crosses the bases of the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones and inter- ossei muscles, to form the deep arch by anastomosing with the deep communicating artery from the ulnar. The line indicating the deep arch is half an inch nearer the wrist-joint than the superficial. Branches of the Deep Arch. (Radial in the hand.) (a) Princeps poUicis, is a branch from the radial just as it enters the palm. It passes outward and downward between the adductor poUicis and the abductor indicis muscles. Over the metacarpophalangeal joint it divides into two branches, one for each side of the thumb. (K) Radialis indicis, issues between the adductor pollicis and abductor indicis muscles, descends along the outer anterior border of the index finger to its tip. {c) Palmar interos- seous arteries, three in number; descend between the in- dex and middle, middle and ring, and ring and little fingers, along the anterior surface of the interossei muscles, and terminate by joining the digital branches from the super- ficial arch. See page 305. They supply the adjoining muscles, (d) The recurrent, are two or more small twigs which pass upward to the front of the carpus and form an anastomosis with the anterior carpal branches of the radial, ulnar, and anterior interosseous arteries, (e) The perforat-

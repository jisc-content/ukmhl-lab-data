A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 564 Insertion.—Into the front of the tibia just internal to the tubercle by an inverted J-shaped tendon, the curve of the J hooking over the tendons of the gracilis and semitendino- sus muscles. Also, into the deep fascia over the lower part of the knee-joint and upper part of the leg. Nerve Supply.—The anterior crural, through its middle cutaneous branch, which pierces the muscle at its upper and middle thirds. Actions.—To flex the thigh on the abdomen, to flex the leg on the thigh, to rotate the thigh outward, to rotate the leg (when semiflexed) inward. It has a slight action of abduction, but no action tending to cross (adduct) the thighs. Acting from below it will flex the pelvis on the femur, and slightly rotate it toward the opposite side. Tensor Vaginae Pemoris. Figs. 117, 118. Origin.—From the anterior one inch of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium, the upper portion of the notch below, and from the fascia covering the gluteus medius (a portion of the fascia lata). Insej^tion.—Into the inner surface of the fascia lata at its upper fourth, and by the continuation of the fascia, under the name of the iliotibial band, into the head of the fibula and external tuberosity of the tibia. The muscle at its in- sertion is found between two laminae of the fascia lata. An external part of the fascial covering of the thigh, which reaches up to the crest of the ilium ; and an internal layer, which passes up to the anterior inferior spine of the ilium and the tendons of the rectus muscle. Nerve Supply.—The superior gluteal, which comes for- ward between the gluteus medius and minimus, and enters the posterior surface of the muscle. Action.—To tense the fascia lata, to flex the thigh, to

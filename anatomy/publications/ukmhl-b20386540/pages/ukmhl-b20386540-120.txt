A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 120 and in the sublingual fossa of the inferior maxilla. It rests upon the mylohyoid muscle, and has the geniohyo- glossus muscle and the opposite gland at the inner side. Behind, it comes in contact with the deep lobe of the sub- maxillary gland. Its main duct is called the duct of Rivinus. It accom- panies Wharton's duct and opens with it upon the top of the same papilla in the mouth. Numerous smaller ducts from the anterior portion of the gland open upon the floor of the mouth. The blood supply is from the subhngual (from the Un- gual) and the submental (from the facial). The nerve supply is from the gustatory (lingual) and sympathetic. The Internal Maxillary Artery. The internal maxillary artery is the larger branch of bifurcation of the external carotid. It is given off behind the neck of the lower jaw within the parotid gland. It follows a tortuous course forward and inward, passing between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament, then upward and forward across the front (exter- nal surface) of the external pteryoid muscle, then turns into the sphenomaxillary fossa, where it divides into its terminal branches. The course of the artery divides it into three portions, the maxillary, behind the neck of the jaw ; the pterygoid, in connection with the pterygoid muscle ; and the sphenomaxillary, within this fossa. Branches of the Internal Maxillary.â€”Maxillary portion or first portion. (1) The deep auricular. A small branch to the anterior wall of the external meatus. (2) The tympanic branch, a very slender artery which

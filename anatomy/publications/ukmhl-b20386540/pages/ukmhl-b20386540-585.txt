THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR, 583 The anterior branch suppHes the pectineus, adductor brevis and longus, and the gracilis muscles, the hip joint, and the intecrument at the middle of the inner side of the o thigh. The posterior branch descends through the obturator ex- ternus muscle, then between the adductor brevis and mag- nus, and is continued as a long, slender filament through the lower part of the last muscle into the popliteal space^ through which it descends on the anterior surface of the popliteal vessels to the posterior ligament of the knee joint. The posterior branch supplies the obturator externus, and adductor magnus muscles, the hip and knee joints. The Accessory Obturator Nerve. Fig. 107. For the formation, course, and distribution of this nerve, see page 536. The Obturator Artery. Figs. 112, 114, 120. This is a branch from the anterior division of the inter- nal iliac artery. For its course and branches within the pelvis, see page 547. The artery appears with the nerve at the upper margin of the obturator externus muscle, which it perforates, and divides into an internal and an external branch. These course along the internal and external margins of the obturator foramen respectively, anastomose with each other at the lower border of the foramen and supply branches to the adjacent muscles. In addition the internal branch anastomoses with the internal circumflex, and the external branch passes outward below the hip (which it supplies) and terminates in small branches which anastomose with the terminal branches of the sciatic artery.

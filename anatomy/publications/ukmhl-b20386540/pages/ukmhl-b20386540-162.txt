A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 162 distribution in other parts of the body in the following points :â€” (i) The main arteries do not divide and subdivide and continue to do so until the arterial capillaries are reached, but each trunk gives off along its course branches which are of the same size, and the trunk ends in terminals which are of the same size as the branches. (2) The branches from the ganglionic system do not anastomose with each other, nor do the branches of the cortical system, nor do the branches of both systems anastomose with each other. (3) The arteries enter the brain vertically to its surface, and proceed inward along approximally straight hnes. The Ganglionic System. Diag. 10. Figs. 21, 22. This system embraces all the branches arising from the circle of Willis and an inch beyond it. The branches are arranged in four groups (two being double, making six really). (i) The anteromedian group. These are from the anterior cerebral and supply the anterior part of the cor- pus striatum. (2) (3) The anterolateral. Branches from the middle cerebral to the corpus striatum and anterior part of the optic thalamus. These branches entering the base of the brain produce that sieve-like appearance to which the name of perforated " space (anterior) is given. The lenticulostriate artery is the largest and most im- portant branch of this group, because it is most frequently the seat of hemorrhage or embolism. Its course is upward between the lenticular nucleus and the external capsule, it then turns inward through the internal capsule, and terminates in the caudate nucleus.

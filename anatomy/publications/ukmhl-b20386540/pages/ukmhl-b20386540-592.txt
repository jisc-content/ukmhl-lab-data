A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 590 brevis digitorum muscles blend with the margins of the long extensor tendons along the first phalanges. Nerve Supply.—The anterior tibial. Action.—To extend the toes, to flex the foot upon the leg. The action upon the toes is most marked upon the first phalanges, the extension of the second and third phalanges being effected through the interossei and lumbri- cales. Extensor Proprius Hallucis. Figs. 123, 124. Origin.—From the middle two-fourths of the anterior surface (antero-internal) of the fibula and from the interos- seous membrane adjacent to this origin. Insertion.—Into the dorsal surface of the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. At the metatarsophalangeal articulation a fibrous expansion from the tendon passes to the lateral ligaments of the articulation. Nerve Supply.—The anterior tibial. Action.—To extend the great toe, to flex the foot, to adduct the fore part of the foot, to raise (invert) the inner border of the foot. Due to the tendon being crossed by the lower leg of the ■< ligament. See Attachments of Annular Ligament^ page 585. Peroneus Tertius. Figs. 123, 124. Origin.—From the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the fibula, being continuous with the extensor longus digitorum, from the adjacent interosseous membrane, and intermuscular fascia. Insertion.—Into the upper surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. Nerve Sttpply.—The anterior tibial. Action.—To flex the ankle-joint, to raise the outer border of the foot (eversion), to abduct the fore part of the foot.

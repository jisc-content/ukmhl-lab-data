A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 136 It appears in the dissection of the posterior region of the neck, under the complexus and upon the semispinaHs ; its course is vertically upward to anastomose at the suboccip- ital triangle with the deep branch (continuation) of the princeps cervicis of the occipital. The artery in its course enters into anastomoses with branches of the vertebral. The Deep Cervical Vein {Profiuida Cervicis Veiii). This begins in the suboccipital triangle by the confluence of smaller veins from the surrounding parts. It descends along the course of the deep cervical artery, and opens into the innominate or vertebral veins. The Vertebral Vein. See page 111. In the suboccipital triangle the deep cervical and verte- bral veins freely communicate. The vertebral receives tributaries from within the spinal canal, the vertebrae, and muscles. The Suboccipital Nerve. The posterior division of the first cervical nerve passes backward between the vertebral artery and the posterior arch of the atlas, then through the suboccipital triangle to the deep surface of the complexus muscle. It supplies the muscles forming the triangle, the rectus capitis posticus minor, the complexus, and sends a twig to the great occipital nerve. The Deep Cervical Fascia. The deep cervical fascia consists of the membranous sheaths of muscles, the covering of glands (capsules), the firm supporting encasement of vessels and the thinner ones of nerves, and the connecting processes (or ligaments) which join the detached to the fixed parts of the head and neck.

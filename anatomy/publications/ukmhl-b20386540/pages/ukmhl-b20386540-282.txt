Insertion.—Into the anterior aspect of the vertebral bor- der and superior and inferior angles of the scapula. Nerve Supply.—The posterior or long thoracic (external respiratory of Bell), which brings filaments from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. Action.—(i) On the scapula. The muscle draws the scapula forward, and owing to the lower portion of the muscle being longer than the upper, the lower angle of the scapula will be advanced farther than its upper angle, thus producing a rotation of the scapula around a central axis perpendicular to its plane surface. This action is further developed in raising the arm to a vertical position, the deltoid carr^^ing it to a right angle, the trapezius and serra- tus magnus completing the action. (2) On the ribs. If the scapula is fixed backward, the muscle would tend to draw the ribs outward, and so enlarge the chest laterally and aid inspiration. The Posterior Thoracic Nerve. Figs. 63, 64. For formation, see description of brachial plexus, page 315. Appears in the axilla posterior to the axillary artery and vein, continues downward across the middle of the serratus magnus muscle to the various digitations to which it is distributed. The Intercostohumeral Nerve. Figs. 62, 63, 64. This comes through the second intercostal space. It is the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve. In the floor of the axilla some of its filaments interlace with others from the lesser internal cutaneous nerve to form a loose plexus. The nerve is then distributed to the integu- ment of the inner, upper, and posterior part of the arm.

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 269 tal ridge, for a distance of two inches below the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The tendon of insertion is in two layers, the anterior layer belonging to the clavicular portion of the muscle ; the posterior layer to the sternocos- tal portion. These layers are open above but joined below along the lower border of the tendon. The fibres of the muscle (sternocostal) inserted into the posterior layer of the tendon are twisted on themselves until the lower fibres of origin take the highest point of insertion, and the highest fibres of origin take the lowest point of insertion. Nerve Supply.—From the anterior thoracics : The ex- ternal thoracic nerve arises from the outer cord and enters the muscle above the pectoralis minor ; the internal nerve comes from the inner cord and pierces the minor to end in the major muscle. Action.—(i) On the humerus. The muscle adducts and flexes the humerus if previously extended ; when the arm is at the side it will rotate it internally and draw it across the front of the chest (adduction and flexion). (2) On the shoulder. When the arm is fixed the muscle will draw the shoulder downward and forward. (3) On the chest. When the body is supported on the arms the pectoral muscles sling the chest between them. If the arms are fixed upward and forward the muscles will raise the body (as in climbing). The sternocostal portion of the muscle may have some action in enlarging the chest in difficult respiration, and thus become an accessory muscle of inspiration. The Cephalic Vein. Figs. 60, 61. (Now dissected from the middle of the arm ; see below for its formation at the elbow.) The cephalic vein starts just above the elbow-joint by the confluence of the median cephaHc and the radial veins;

334 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. behind, right bronchus ; above, transverse aorta ; below, the left auricle. In the root of the lung it is between the bronchus (above) and the pulmonary veins (below) ; behind is the azygos vein, pneumogastric nerve, and posterior pulmonary plexus. The Left Pulmonary Artery. Is shorter than the right, reaches to the left lung, and divides into two branches. Relations.â€”In front, phrenic nerve, anterior pulmonary plexus, left pleura ; behind, descending aorta, left pneumo- gastric nerve, posterior pulmonary plexus ; below (and in front), pulmonary veins, left bronchus. The Aorta. (The description will be given here in full. For dissection see page 352). Figs. 57, 58, 69 to 74. The outlet for the blood from the left ventricle. In the subject is seen to be contained in the pericardium for its first two inches (or less). It presents to the right of and behind the pulmonary artery and right auricle. Its direction is upward, backward, and to the left, then down- ward along the spinal column to leave the thorax through the aortic opening. It is divided into the ascending, trans- verse, descending, and thoracic portions. The Ascending- Aorta. Diag. 22. This is about two inches long. It begins at the left ventricle of the heart, passes upward, curving slightly to the right in its course ; it ends where the artery turns to pass transversely into the left portion of the thorax. From its base on the right and left sides are given off the coronary arteries to the heart, the left coronary artery supplying the left ventricle mostly, and the right, the right ventricle. At the base of the aorta it is dilated into three

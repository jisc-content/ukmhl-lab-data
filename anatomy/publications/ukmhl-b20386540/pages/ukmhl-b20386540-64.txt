The facial artery comes into the face from the neck over the lower border of the inferior maxillary bone, lying in the facial notch just at the junction of the ramus and body, at the anterior border of the masseter muscle. It takes a very tortuous course around the angle of the mouth and along the side of the nose to terminate at the inner angle of the eye. In its course it passes under the platysma, zygomatic major and minor, the levator labii superioris, and levator labii superioris alaequse nasi. The facial vein lies behind the artery. Branches of the Facial Ai^tery. On the Face. (i) Muscular, to the masseter and buccinator muscles. The masseteric branches anastomose with the transverse facial and muscular branches from the internal maxillary. The buccal, with the same, and also with the infra-orbital, from the internal maxillary. (2) The inferior labial. Its course is forward under the depressor anguli oris and mid- way between the border of the lip and the chin, to supply the muscles of the lower lip. It anastomoses with the facial branches above and below itself and across the median line. All the anterior facial branches anastomose across the median line with corresponding arteries from the opposite facial, as well as with the arteries next above and below. Exception : the coronary arteries do not anastomose with each other, except at the angle of the mouth. (3) The inferior coronary. Extends forward beneath the depressor

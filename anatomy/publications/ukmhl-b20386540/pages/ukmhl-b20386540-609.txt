THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. 607 From the upper and back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, along the lower border of the groove for the ten- don of the obturator externus. The tendon of the obtura- tor internus leaves the pelvis through the small sacrosciatic foramen; after coming through the foramen it receives the two gemelli niuscles, the superior above and the inferior below, on either side. These small muscles are really portions of the obturator internus arising external to the pelvic cavity. Insertion.—The common tendon of the three muscles is attached to the front of the upper margin of the great tro- chanter (in front of the pyriformis as explained. See Pyri- formis). Between the tendon of the obturator internus and the margin of the small sacrosciatic foramen is a large bursa ; another one may exist between the tendon and the capsule of the hip joint. Nerve Supply.—By muscular branches from the sacral plexus. The nerve to the obturator internus gives a branch to the gemellus superior, while the gemellus inferior receives its supply from the nerve to the quadratus femoris. See pages 6io, 612. Action.—To rotate the thigh outward (external rotators) when the limb is extended. If the thigh be flexed the muscles act as abductors of it. The femur being the fixed point, the opposite side of the pelvis will be carried backward in extension or flexion. Quadratus Femoris. Figs. 126, 127. Origi7t.—From the outer hp of the tuberosity of the ischium. Inse^'tion.—Into the linea quadrati, which extends verti- cally downward from the middle of the posterior intertro- chanteric line for about one and one-half inches.

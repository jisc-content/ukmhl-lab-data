The septum lucidum consists of a double layer for some extent; the small, oval, slit-like cavity between the two layers is the fifth ventricle. This ventricle is not, in all probability, a portion of the foetal longitudinal fissure which has become included beneath the corpus callosum, but is formed within the originally solid septum lucidum by a process of vacuola- tion. The fifth ventricle has no communication with, nor is it formed in any Hke manner to, the rest of the ventricular cavities of the brain. The Fornix. Figs. 29, 31, 32, 35, 38, 39, 40, 43 to 47 inclusive. The fornix is a double band of fibres, one on each side of the median line, separated in front and behind but coming together in the middle, where they fuse for a short distance and form the body. The anterior and posterior separated portions are called the anterior and posterior pillars re- spectively. The fornix begins at the base of the brain, as the anterior pillaj's, in the corpora albicantia. The pillars ascend nearly vertically and at the anterior extremity of the third ventricle until they nearly reach the under surface of the corpus callosum, then they turn suddenly backward (the genua) (leaving an aperture extending into the third ventricle, which is the foramen of Monro), become united to each other, forming the body of the fornix, and to the under surface of the corpus callosum. After a short distance they again diverge, and, as the postejdor pillars, pass outward and downward to the outer surface of the hippocampus major, with which they become blended.

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, POSTERIOR. 365 and inward, and to rotate the humerus inward (adduction, extension, and internal rotation of humerus). The insertion being the fixed point, the muscle will raise the body and swing it forward (if both muscles are acting) or to one side (if only one muscle acts). Acting upon the ribs, it will raise them and act as an accessory muscle of inspiration. DISSECTION. Cut the deltoid away from its origin and turn it downward and forward ; in doing so save its nerve and arterial supply. Disarticulate the clavicle from its acromial attachment; divide the coraco- clavicular ligaments and draw the clavicle out of the way. Remove the supra- and infraclavicular fasciae and clean the muscles covered by them. Also, clean the levator anguli scapulae, rhomboid, and teres muscles. Remove the fascia covering the triceps. The superficial fascia of the arm has been already de- scribed (see page 282). The cutaneous nerves of the back of the shoulder and arm. The shoulder receives filaments through the acromial nerves from the third and fourth cervical nerves. See page 91. The deltoid region of the arm and a small surface of the outer part of the arm from the deltoid half-way to the elbow is suppHed by the circumflex nerve. The rest of the outer portion of the arm is supplied by the superior external cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral nerve. The inner half of the back of the arm is suppHed from above downward by the internal cutaneous branch of the musculospiral, the intercostohumeral, and the lesser internal cutaneous nerves.

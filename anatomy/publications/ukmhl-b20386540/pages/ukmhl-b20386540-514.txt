512 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. q. V. above, {li) From the convex side the vasa intestini tenuis, 12 to 16 branches, are given off to supply the small intestine from the last portion of the duodenum to within a short distance from the caecum. These intestinal branches form from three to five systems of arterial anastomoses between their origin and distribution, (c) The ileocolic supplies the last portion of the small intestine and the beginning (caecum) of the large. It anastomoses on one side with the last intestinal branch and on the other with the colica dextra. This artery is distributed to the ascending colon, (e) The colica media supplies the trans- verse colon. These last three arteries form long arterial arches from one to the other, and from the main arches other secondary ones are formed before the intestine is finally reached. Along with the artery runs the vein, only in the contrary direction, and at the right side of the artery. The vein disappears under the pancreas, where it helps to form the portal vein. See page 514. Its tributaries are the right gastro-epiploic, pancreaticoduodenal (superior and inferior), besides the veins corresponding to the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. DISSECTION. Tie two strong strings around the small intestine six inches from the duo- denum and the same distance from the csecum, divide the intestine between the cords at both points, cut it away from its mesentery, and remove it entirely. Clean the inferior mesenteric artery, tracing its branches to the descending colon, omega loop, and rectum. The Inferior Mesenteric Artery. Figs. 102, 105. Is given off from the left side of the abdominal aorta one and one-half inches above its bifurcation. Its Branches. (a) The colica sinistra supplies the descending colon. {B) The sigmoid is distributed to the sigmoid, or omega

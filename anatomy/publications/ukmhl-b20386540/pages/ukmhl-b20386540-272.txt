A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 270 it runs upward in the groove at the outer margin of the biceps muscle, then enters the interval between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, to finally pierce the costo- coracoid membrane in front of the clavicle and empty into the axillary vein. In the course between the last muscles it is accompanied by the descending (humeral) branch of the acromiothoracic artery. DISSECTION. Section the pectoralis major at its middle and outer thirds, and cut it away from the clavicle. Raise the parts and reflect them. Notice the formation and method of insertion of the tendon, and the nerve and arterial supply to the inner part of the muscle. Carefully expose the deep fascia (costocor^acoid membrane). The nerves and arteries exposed can now be completed. The Costocoracoid Membrane. Fig. 6i. This starts from the under surface of the clavicle in two layers, one in front, the other behind the subclavius muscle. These two layers become united along the front of the muscle and form a single plane of fascia that spreads downward to the pectoralis minor muscle, inward to the first rib and cartilage, and the aponeurosis of the first inter- costal space, and outward to the coracoid process. The portion of the membrane between the coracoid process and the first costal cartilage is much thicker and stronger than any other part of the membrane, and is known as the costo- eoracoid ligament. The costocoracoid membrane is perforated by the cephalic and acromiothoracic veins, the acromiothoracic artery, the external anterior thoracic nerve, and the axillary lymphatic trunk. The outward continuation of this membrane is in the shape of two layers of thin fascia which enclose the pector- alis minor muscle, unite at the lower margin of the same,

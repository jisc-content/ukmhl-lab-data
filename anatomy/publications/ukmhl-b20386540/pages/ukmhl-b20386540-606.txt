A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 604 tain the knee in that position and to resist flexion, yet after flexion is once started its action (if any) is as indicated above. (4) Upon the trunk. Taking its fixed point from below the muscle will extend the trunk upon the thighs as in assuming an upright position after stooping forward. The action of the gluteus maximus and tensor vaginae femoris, through the attachment of the iliotibial band is very necessary in the maintenance of the trunk erect when standing upon one leg. They act here like the guy rope to a derrick in lifting a weight, the femur being the up- right, the pelvis the cross beam, and the body the weight; the centre of motion being at the hip joint. The Small Sciatic Nerve. Fig. 126. The small sciatic nerve is formed by branches from the second and third sacral nerves, passes through the great sacrosciatic foramen under the pyriformis muscle, then be- neath the gluteus maximus and behind the fascia lata through the middle of the thigh into the popliteal space, where it pierces the deep fascia and supplies the integu- ment over the popHteal space and the upper third of the calf of the leg. Its Branches are :â€” (1) Recurrent cutaneous branches to the integument over the gluteus maximus. (2) The inferior pudendal. This branch turns inward under the gluteus maximus, pierces the deep fascia about an inch external to the tuberosity of the ischium (see page 406,) and runs forward to supply the inner side of the thigh and the scrotum (or the labium majus). (3) The femoral cutaneous branches supply the skin over the back of the thigh and popliteal space.

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 263 the lungs would begin over the middle of the clavicles, pass upward and inward for a distance of three-fourths of an inch until over the sternal end of the clavicles, then drawn downward and inward, crossing the sternoclavicular articulations, toward the middle line of the body, to meet at the level of the upper border of the second cartilages (junc- tion of first and second pieces of the sternum). The anterior borders of the two lungs lie in contact (separated by the pleurse) from this point to the level of the middle of the sternum (the mid-point between the fourth carti- lages). From here they separate, due to the presence of a notch in the anterior border of the left lung for the accom- modation of the heart. The right continues directly down- ward to the sternal end of the sixth cartilage. The left turns outward and downward along the upper border of the fifth cartilage until it reaches a distance of one and one-half inches from the middle line, when it turns downward to the upper margin of the sixth rib three inches from the median line. Each lung is divided into two main lobes by the great fissure and the right has in addition a third lobe cut off by a secondary fissure. The g-reat fissure is indicated on the chest by drawing a line from the third dorsal spine obliquely downward and forward to the sixth costochondral articulation, for the left side ; and from the fourth dorsal spine to the seventh costo- chondral joint on the right side. The secondary fissure, on the right side, is drawn from the angle of the sixth to the cartilage of the fourth rib. The lower border of the lungs is represented by a line drawn around the chest diagonally from the sixth cartilage at the sternum, to the tenth dorsal spine behind. On the left side this line represents the lower border also, but it should be started at a distance of three inches from the middle line. This entire border

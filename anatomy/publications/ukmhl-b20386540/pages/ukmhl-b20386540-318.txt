It passes upward between the axillary artery and vein from the inner cord to the under surface of the pecto- ralis minor muscle. Some filaments pass through the minor and terminate in the major. The external and inter- nal nerves form a slight interlacement with each other between the two pectoral muscles. (/;) The lesser internal cutaneous descends to the floor of the axillary space and enters into a loose plexus with the intercosto- humeral nerve. The nerve itself is distributed to the skin of the inner and back part of the arm over and above the olecranon process, {c) The internal cutaneous nerve, another branch from the internal cord, passes through the axillary space, along the inner side of the arm above the elbow, divides into two branches, the anterior, which supplies the skin of the inner half of the front of the fore- arm as low as the wrist, and the posterior branch, which takes a similar supply upon the back of the inside of the forearm, (d^ The ulnar nerve. This continues the direct course of the inner cord, descends along the inside of the arm with the inferior profunda artery, behind the internal condyle of the humerus with the recurrent branch of the ulnar, between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, then between the flexor sublimis and profundus digitorum muscles ; at the middle and upper thirds of the forearm joins the ulnar artery at its inner side, keeps this position with reference to the artery into the hand ; here it divides into its terminal digital branches.

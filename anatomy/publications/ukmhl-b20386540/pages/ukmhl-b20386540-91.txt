For the distribution see (i). (6) The muscular branch to the trapezius muscle appears on the posterior border of the sternomastoid at its middle, passes backward to the trapezius, and with the spinal acces- sory, which courses at a higher level, is distributed to this muscle. (7) , (8), (9) The branches to the integument over the sternum, clavicle, and acromial regions. They become superficial at the posterior border of the sternomastoid muscle and descend to their distribution. The supra- sternal to the integument over the first piece of the sternum ; the supraclavicular, to the skin over the front of the clavi- cle (and chest as low as the fourth rib) ; and the supra- acromial to the region of the shoulder.

It continues downward through the sternomastoid muscle, in the substance of which it forms a plexiform junction with a branch from the second cervical nerve for the supply of the muscle, then appears at the posterior border of the sternomastoid and extends down- ward and backward to the anterior surface of the trapezius, to which (with branches from the third and fourth cervical nerves) it is distributed. The deep course of the nerve after it comes through the central compartment of the jugu- lar foramen (with the ninth and the tenth nerves) is down- ward and backward across the internal jugular vein and

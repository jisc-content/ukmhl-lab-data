428 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. composed of two small corpora cavernosa attached simi- larly to the corpora cavernosa in the male. See page 416. The corpora cavernosa converge from the pubic arch, unite to form the body of the clitoris, and terminate in a blunt extremity (different from the male) which is called the glans clitoridis. The clitoris is covered by a modified integument, and is suspended from the symphysis pubis by a small ligament similar to the suspensory ligament of the penis. The Artery and Nerve to the Bulb. See pages 412, 414. The Artery and Nerve to the Corpus Cavernosum and the Dorsal Artery and Nerve of the Clitoris. See pages 413, 414. Fig. 86. The Anterior Layer of the Triang'ular Ligament. The description on page 403 will answer for this struc- ture in the female, in addition noting that it is perforated by the vagina. DISSECTION. Remove the anterior layer of the triangular ligament. Compressor Urethrse. Constrictor Vaginae. {Deep Transversus Pej^incei.') The compressor urethrse muscle occupies the same posi- tion in the female that it does in the male. Besides its urethral function it also constricts the vagina. It is not so well developed as in the male. See page 416. Various small muscles are described in this plane by various dissectors. It is sufficient if the student now recog- nizes the above muscle. The Glands of Bartholin. [Cowper's Glands in the male.) These are two small glands lying opposite to the posterior half of the vaginal orifice, just behind the bulbs of the vagina, imbedded within the constrictor vaginae muscle.

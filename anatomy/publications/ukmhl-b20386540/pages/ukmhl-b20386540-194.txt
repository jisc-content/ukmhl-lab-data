194 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. The internal is continuous with the superior frontal convolution, the anterior with the middle frontal, and the posterior or external with the inferior frontal convolution. The internal convolution is grooved by the olfactory sulcus, within which rests the olfactory nerve. The under surfaces of the temporal and occipital lobes should be taken together, as there is no Hne separating them. The fissures seen here are portions of the hippocampal or dentate, the parieto-occipital, the calcarine, the collateral, and the inferior temporal. This last is more often com- posed of several short, indistinct grooves, which extend anteroposteriorly along near the external borders of the temporal and occipital lobes. External to the inferior temporal sulcus is the inferior temporal convolution (ante- riorly) and the inferior occipital (posteriorly). Between the above sulcus and the collateral fissure lies the inferior occipitotemporal, or simply the occipitotemporal convolu- tion. Then between the collateral and the calcarine, fissures is the superior occipitotemporal convolution, which, as explained before, is described under the names of the uncinate gyrus for the anterior part, and the lingulate convolution for the posterior portion. To see these convo- lutions and sulci the cerebellum must be raised. The cerebral hemispheres will be found separated ante- riorly and posteriorly by the great longitudinal fissure. By raising the temporal lobe the beginning of the Sylvian fissure is found : it starts behind the frontal lobe in a de- pressed portion of the base of the brain (anterior perforated space). Projecting backward from the centre of the base of the cerebrum, between the temporal lobes, are seen the two rounded masses of fibres, which are called the legs of the

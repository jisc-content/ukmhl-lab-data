A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 494 The Stomach. Figs. 96 to 100, 103, 104, 105. The stomach lies on the left side of the abdomen, below the diaphragm and left lobe of the liver. It is about twelve inches long, four inches wide, and weighs four and one-half ounces. It is entirely covered by peritoneum. See De- velopment, page 462. Its long- axis is placed obliquely from above, behind, and at the left, to downward, forward, and to the right. It has two opening's, the cardiac, the opening of the oesophagus into the stomach, and the pyloric, the beginning of the intestinal canal. There is no constriction about the cardia, but around the pylorus is a muscular collar forming a sphincter. The short border, or the lesser curvature, is three and one-half inches long and concave. From it passes the gastrohepatic omentum to the liver. See above. From the longer border, or the greater curvature, hangs down the broad peritoneal apron, the greater or gastrocolic omentum. The fundus is the dilated end of the stomach to the left of the cardia. At the oesophagus the anterior and posterior layers of peritoneum come together and pass on to the diaphragm, forming the g"astrophrenic ligament. To the right along the lesser curvature these layers after joining, form the gastrohepatic omentum and continue to the liver, while below from the greater curvature these two layers unite to form the great omentum, and returning again to the colon may also be called the gastrocolic omentum. Relations.â€”The anterior surface is in relation with the liver, diaphragm, and anterior abdominal wall. The area of stomach opposed directly to the abdominal wall is re- presented by a triangle formed on the right by the anterior

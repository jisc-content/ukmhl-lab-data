UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, POSTERIOR. 387 The arteries which form the anastomosis about the elbow-joint are the following :—In front of the elbow : On the outer side there is the termination of the superior profunda above and the recurrent radial below ; on the inner side the anterior branch of the anastomotica magna above and the anterior ulnar recurrent below. Behind the elbow : On the outer side the articular branch of the superior profunda above, and the recurrent interos- seous below ; on the inner side the posterior branch of the anastomotica magna and the inferior profunda above, with the posterior ulnar recurrent below. On the back of the elbow all these arteries inosculate to form a free plexus and communication with each other. The Radial Artery at the Wrist. Fig. 79. Continuing the description of the artery from the lower end of the radius where it was left off, see page 293. The artery is seen to run backward around the lower end of the radius, between the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and brevis poUicis and the external lateral liga- ment of the wrist-joint, to the interval between the bases of the first and second metacarpal bones, where it lies under the tendon of the extensor longus pollicis muscle. It now passes forward and inward between the first and second metacarpal bones and the two heads of the abductor indicis muscle to the palmar side of the hand, where it is continued as the deep arch. See page 310. The Bra7tches of the Radial at the Back of the Wrist.— (i) The posterior carpal arises as the radial issues from under the tendon of the extensor brevis pollicis, runs inward across the back of the wrist, and terminates by anas- tomosing with the posterior ulnar carpal and the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. From this posterior

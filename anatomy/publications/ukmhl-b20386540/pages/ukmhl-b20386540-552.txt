A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 550 of an inch behind the lower margin of the symphysis and two inches above the level of the perineum. Internal Trig'one.—This is the triangular area mapped out by connecting the orifices of the ureters and internal meatus of the urethra by imaginary lines. The Urethra. This is the membranous tube which forms the outlet to the bladder and seminal vesicles. Its length is approxi- mately six inches when the penis is relaxed. Its diameter to the size of the penis is as four to nine (Otis). It is divided into the prostatic portion (one and one- quarter inches long), the membranous portion (one-half to three-fourths of an inch long), and the spongy portion (the remainder of the canal). The prostatic portion pierces the prostate from base to apex, lying nearer the anterior than the posterior surface of the gland. On section the canal is U-shaped, with the convexity forward and the legs " backward. Within the prostatic portion the following structures are found :— (i) The verumontanum, or coUiculus seminalis. This is a vertical elevation along the posterior wall of the ure- thra, about half an inch long. At its centre is the opening of a blind canal (2), the sinus pocularis, or the uterus mas- culinus. Embryologically related to the female uterus. Below the opening of the sinus pocularis appear (3) the orifices of the ejaculatory ducts, one on each side of the median line. The depressions along the base of the veru- montanum are called (4) the prostatic sinuses, and into them open (5) the ducts of the prostatic glands. The membranous portion of the urethra is the only fixed

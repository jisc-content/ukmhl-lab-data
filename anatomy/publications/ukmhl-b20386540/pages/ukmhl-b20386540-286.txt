A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 284 about the wrist by means of thickened portions called an- nular ligaments. At the elbow the fascia is united to all the bony points. Behind, to the olecranon, and here it receives the fibrous expansion of the tendon of the triceps muscle. At the sides, to the humeral condyles, and by means of the inter- muscular septa to the condyloid ridges. In front, it receives the fascial prolongation of the bicipital tendon, and is pierced for the deep median vein. The intermuscular septa in the arm separate the anterior from the posterior muscles. In the anterior compartment are the biceps, coracobrachialis, brachialis anticus, origin of the supinator longus, and the extensor carpi radialis longior. In the posterior is the triceps muscle. In the forearm the intermuscular septa are especially well-marked and appear as ''white lines," indicating the separations between the various muscles and forming guides to the arteries. DISSECTION. Remove the superficial veins and the deep fascia to just below the elbow. Leave the insertion of the biceps into the deep fascia. Complete the dissection of the parts exposed. Coracobrachialis. Fig. 62. Origin—From the tip of the coracoid process of the scapula with the short head of the biceps. Insertion.—Into the middle third of the inner border of the humerus for a distance of two inches. Nerve Supply.—By the musculocutaneous, which usually passes through the muscle. The nerve filaments come from the seventh cervical nerve. Action.—It is an adductor and flexor of the arm ; helps to hold the humerus against the scapula.

142 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The cartilage which constitutes the anterior portion of the Eustachian tube forms a prominent ring around the opening orifice called the tubal e^ninence. Behind the Eustachian tube opening is a blind pit, the fossa of Rosenmiiller. Below the posterior nares the soft palate hangs down- ward and terminates medianly in the uvula. The soft palate serves to shut off the nasal passages from the pharynx in deglutition. Laterally the free margin of the soft palate is thrown into two prominent arches ; the posterior, descending to the pharyngeal wall; the anterior, to the side of the tongue, leaving a hollow between them. These arches are called the anterior and posterior arches of the fauces, or the anterior and posterior palatine arches. The depres- sion between them is the tonsillar recess, and lodges the tonsil. The posterior arch is produced by the palatopharyngeus, the anterior by the palatoglossus muscle. The tonsils are two oval-shaped masses of spongy ade- noid tissue, situated within the two palatine arches. Their size in the cadaver is never as large as in the living, conse- quently their relative size can best be estimated from an examination of the throats of friends. The roof of the pharynx is occupied by an adenoid mass, the pharyng-eal tonsil, which in children sometimes assumes very large proportions. The base of the tongue is seen below the soft palate. The opening of the mouth posteriorly into the pharynx is called the isthmus faucium. It is bounded by the soft palate above, the faucial arches and tonsils laterally, and the base of the tongue below. Upon the base of the tongue will be seen in the middle line the foramen csecum.

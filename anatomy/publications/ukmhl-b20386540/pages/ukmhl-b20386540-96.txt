(5) The Posterior Auricular Artery : See Dissection of the Face, page 65. This is the second branch from the back of the external carotid. It is given off just above the occipital, runs up- ward and backward between the spinal accessory and facial nerves, and through the parotid gland to the groove between the external auditory meatus and the mastoid process, and supplies branches to the ear and the scalp behind it. From the posterior auricular is given off the stylomastoid branch which enters the foramen of that name. (6) The Ascending" Pharyngeal: This is the first branch of the external, and comes off in the angle between it and the internal carotid. It is a long, slender artery, which runs upward between the pharynx, internal carotid, and spine to the base of the skull. It supplies fine branches to the pharynx, front of the spine, palate, and posterior meningeal, which reach the interior of the skull through the middle lacerated, jugular, and anterior condyloid foramina.

26 A MANUAL OF AAA TO MY. men, of that name, and, ascending vertically over the fore- head, is distributed to the integument of this region and the anterior portion of the scalp. The Frontal and Supra-orbital Arteries. Fig. 3. The first is one of the terminal branches of the ophthal- mic, the second a branch also from the ophthalmic. The frontal accompanies the supratrochlear nerve (see above); the supra-orbital the nerve of the same name through the supra-orbital foramen to the distribution of that nerve. The former artery anastomoses with the opposite frontal and the supra-orbital arteries, the latter with the frontal and anterior branch of the temporal. The Temporal Artery. Figs. 2 and 3. This is the external branch of bifurcation of the external carotid. It starts under the parotid gland at the neck of the lower jaw, passes upward and over the zygoma, and divides into the anterior and posterior temporal branches. These are distributed to the anterior, lateral, and posterior portions of the head. The anterior anastomoses in front with the frontal and supra-orbital; the posterior, with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries ; and both, over the top of the head, with the corresponding arteries of the other side, and in the lateral region with each other. For remaining branches see page 62. Temporal Branches of the Facial, and Auriculotem- poral Branch of the Fifth Nerves. Figs. 2, 3. For the former see the facial nerve, page 61. The auriculotemporal branch of the fifth nerve is found (at a later stage of the dissection, see page 117) to arise by two roots trunks, which surround the middle meningeal

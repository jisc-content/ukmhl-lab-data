THE ABDOMEN, EXTERIOR. 451 Transversalis Abdominis. Figs. 91, 94. Origin.—By fleshy slips from the inner surfaces of the six lower costal cartilages, interdigitating with the origins of the diaphragm. From the lumbar fascia, and the ante- rior three-fourths of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, and from the outer third of Poupart's ligament. Insertion.—By the conjoined tendon as given. See page 447. Into the whole length of the linea alba, which it helps to form. The Lumbar Fascia. Fig. 76. Diag. 29. Consists of three layers. The anterior, from the bases of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The middle, from the tips of the same processes. The pos- terior, by the broad sheath of the erector spinae muscle from the spinous processes and the supraspinous ligaments of the lumbar and adjoining dorsal and sacral vertebrae. Between the first and second layers is the quadratus lum- borum ; between the second and third, the erector spinae. That portion of the anterior layer extending from the first lumbar vertebra to the tip of the last rib is called the ligamentum arcuatum externum. Lying upon the traaversalis muscle are the nerves which are passing forward to supply the abdominal muscles. They are the lower six intercostal and the iliohypogastric and ilio-inguinal from the first lumbar. Along with the nerves are found branches from the intercostal and lumbar arteries. The deep circumflex iliac artery gives off several large branches which pass upward between the internal oblique and the transversalis muscles. In the dissection of the preceding muscles it has been noticed that the fibres of the three layers run obhquely or at right angles to each other. The fibres of the trans-

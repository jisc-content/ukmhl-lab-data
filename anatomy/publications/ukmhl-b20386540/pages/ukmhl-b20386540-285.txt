UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR, 283 and the median receives the deep median vein from the in- terior of the forearm and divides into the median cephaHc and median basilic. The deep median vein is formed by the venae comites of the ulnar, radial recurrent, and mus- cular arteries. The median cephalic joins the radial vein to form the cephalic, which passes upward in the groove at the outer border of the biceps muscle. The median basilic joins with the common ulnar to form the basilic, which ascends in the inner brachial groove, pierces the deep fascia in the middle and lower thirds of the arm, and terminates as one of the tributaries forming the axillary vein. The Superficial Nerves. Figs. 62, 63, 65. These are, on the inside of the arm, branches of the intercostohumeral, lesser internal cutaneous, internal cuta- neous ; on the outside, the cutaneous branches of the cir- cumflex and the superior external cutaneous branch of the musculospiral. In the forearm there are, on the inside, the anterior divi- sion of the internal cutaneous, which reaches to the wrist; on the outer side, the external cutaneous branch of the musculocutaneous, which is distributed as low as the ball of the thumb. The Deep Fascia. Figs. 61, 65. The deep fascia of the arm and forearm encases the muscles like a tight sleeve, forming their compartments and fixing them in position. Above it is continuous with the deep fascia covering the deltoid, pectoralis major, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and axillary space. Through these extensions it passes to the spine and acromion process of the scapula and the clavicle. Below, the fascia is attached

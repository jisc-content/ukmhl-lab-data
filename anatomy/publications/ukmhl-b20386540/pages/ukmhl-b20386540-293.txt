The tendon grooves the trapezium upon its inner side and passes superficial and external to the central compartment of the annular ligament. Nerve Supply.—The median, by filaments from the sixth cervical nerve. Actions.—To flex the wrist and slightly abduct the wrist, to pronate and feebly flex the forearm. Palmaris Long-us. Fig. 66. Origin.—Same as the flexor carpi radialis. (See note above.) Insertion.—Into the anterior annular Hgament and central portion of the palmar fascia. Nerve Supply.—The median from the eighth cervical nerve. Action.—Tensor of palmar fascia, feeble flexor of wrist and forearm. The Flexor Carpi Ulnaris. Fig. 66. Origin.—By the common tendon from the internal con- dyle (see note), by a second head from the internal surface of the olecranon and the upper two-thirds of the posterior ridge of the ulna.

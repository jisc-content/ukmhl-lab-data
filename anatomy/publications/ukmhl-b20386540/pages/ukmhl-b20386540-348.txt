(3) The oesophageal, four or five to the oesophagus and mediastinum. (4) The intercostal arteries. There are nine or ten of these distributed to the parietes of the chest. The first and second spaces are supplied by the superior inter- costal branch of the subclavian (see page 113). The right intercostals are slightly longer than the left, owing to the dis- placement of the aorta to the left of the median line. Their course is alike in all. Each artery runs outward, with the intercostal vein above and the nerve below, upon the exter- nal intercostal muscle, then between the external and inter- nal intercostal muscles, and in the intercostal groove of the rib above ; passing around the chest to the front, it finally anastomoses with the upper of the pair of anterior intercos- tal arteries from the internal mammary. The lower inter- costal arteries anastomose with the musculophrenic branch of the internal mammary and the upper lumbar arteries. Each intercostal artery gives off a dorsal artery to the parts posterior to the chest, and a branch to the spine and cord. Also, a small collateral intercostal artery opposite the angle of the ribs. This artery runs forward along the top of the rib below and between the external and internal intercostal muscles to anastomose in front with the lower of the pair of anterior intercostal arteries from the internal mammary. (5) The pleural, muscular, and mammary (from the third,, fourth, and fifth) are small branches from the intercostals. The Intercostal Muscles. The External.

It is surrounded by the compressor urethrse muscle, and has the glands of Cowper in close relation to it. The spongy portion of the urethra. This presents two dilatations : one at its beginning, the pars bulbosa, and one at its termination, the fossa navicularis. The external meatus is the vertical opening of the ure- thra in the glans. Along the spongy portion of the tube are several small blind depressions opening forward, called lacunae. One of these, the lacuna magna, is situated about an inch from the external meatus, and may catch the point of a sound or catheter. The urethra shows on cross sec- tion as a transverse slit in the membranous and spongy portions of the urethra, and at the external meatus as a vertical slit. The Sacral Plexus. Fig. 114. This is formed by the union of the Liunbosacral Cord, (see page 529), and the anterior divisions of the first three sacral nerves to form a broad ribbon at the entrance of the great sacrosciatic foramen. It rests upon the origin of the pyriformis muscle. The fourth sacral nerve enters into the plexus indirectly by sending a branch to join the internal pudic nerve. The fifth sacral nerve has no part in the sacral, but enters into the formation of the coccygeal plexus. The fourth sacral nerve has most of its filaments distrib- uted independently of the sacral plexus, to the skin over the lower internal portion of the gluteus maximus muscle, to the integument of the anus, besides furnishing branches to the external sphincter ani, coccygeus, and levator ani muscles.

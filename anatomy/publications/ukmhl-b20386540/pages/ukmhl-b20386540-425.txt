423 THE PERINEUM, FEMALE. differences will be marked ; these differences are believed to be justified by a careful examination of the subject (living as well as dead) and from the conclusions of other ob- servers. The Vulva.—"The external genitals of the female, ex- cepting the mons veneris " Foster's Dictionary The Pudendum.—"The external genitals (especially those of the female, including the vulva and mons veneris ") (same). Quain uses the terms synonymously to include the mons veneris, labia majora and minora, the hymen or its remains, the clitoris, and meatus urinarius. (1) The Mons Veneris.—The fatty elevation covering the pubes. (2) The Labia Majora.—The homologue of the scrotum, remaining permanently cleft along the middle line (this cleft is the rima pudendi, or genitalis). The labia majora form two elevations reaching from the mons veneris in front toward the tendinous centre of the perineum. The posterior junction of these labia is said to form the posterior com- missure, but an examination of the subject (living and dead) will convince any one that they do not unite in this manner, but flatten out into the smooth covering of the perineum. (3) The Labia Minora.—Related morphologically to the integument and foreskin of the penis. They are two folds of integument (the word is used advisedly) smaller than the labia majora, located internal to the labia majora, by which they are usually concealed from sight. They are joined in front over the clitoris, forming its prepuce, and behind by the fourchette, a thin fold of membrane. (4) The Clitoris.—Akin to the penis of the male. Its blunt extremity is called the g"lans clitoridis, and is cov- ered by the prepuce, formed by the labia minora.

THE HEAD AND NECK, POSTERIOR. 151 branches on the face are four labial (usually), three or four nasal, and two small palpebral branches, supplying in turn the upper lip, side of the nose, and the lower eye- lid. The communications of these branches with the infra- orbital branch of the facial nerve forms the infra-orbital plexus. See page 6i. Meckel's, the Sphenopalatine, or the Nasal Ganglion. Fig. II. This is a small ganglion placed in the sphenomaxillary fossa close to the sphenopalatine foramen and under the superior maxillary nerve, to which it is suspended by two sensory branches forming its sensory root. The motor and sympathetic roots enter the posterior part of the ganglion as the Vidian nerve. The Vidian nerve is formed by the junction of the great superficial petrosal nerve from the facial with the great deep petrosal branch from the sympathetic plexus on the carotid artery in the carotid canal. The united nerves pass forward through the Vidian canal to terminate in Meckel's ganghon. Branches of the ganglion. (1) Ascending or orbital branches. Three or more very small filaments which pass to the orbit through the spheno- maxillary fissure and supply the periosteum and mucous membrane of the posterior ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses. (2) Descending branches. (a) The large or anterior palatine nerve. Passes through the posterior palatine canal to the roof of the mouth, which it supplies as far forward as the incisor teeth. This nerve gives off two in- ferior nasal filaments while in the posterior palatine canal, which pass forward through minute openings to supply the

372 A MANUAL OF AAA TOMY. The Posterior Circumflex Artery and Circumflex Nerve. Fig. 77. The artery is a branch from the third portion of the axillary, the nerve comes from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. See pages 279 and 318. They are found coming through a quadrilateral space bounded above (and in front) by the subscapularis (behind by the teres minor), below by the teres major, internally by the long head of the triceps muscle, and externally by the humerus. The nerve supplies the teres minor and deltoid muscles and sends branches to the shoulder-joint and the skin over the deltoid and middle third of outer surface of the arm. The artery supplies these muscles, the joint of the shoulder, and anastomoses with the anterior circumflex, and by a large branch with the superior profunda arteries. The Superior Profunda Artery and the Musculospiral Nerve. Fig. 77. These are found together as they course through the musculospiral groove, from the inner to the outer side of the arm, where the nerve terminates by dividing into its radial and posterior interosseous branches (see page 318), and the artery by anastomosing with the radial recurrent. The artery also sends a branch upward to anastomose with the posterior circumflex and one downward—the articular—which, descending in the substance of the triceps, supplies that muscle, and terminates in the anasto- motic circle about the elbow-joint (for which see page 387). DISSECTION. Divide the levator anguli scapulae and rhomboid muscles. Clean the inner surface of the serratus magnus, noting its attachments. Remove the serrati muscles and clean the fascia covering the extensor muscles of the spine and note its attachments.

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 392 The Spinal Pia. Fig. 8i. This, like in the brain, is the vascular membrane which encloses the cord from the foramen magnum to the end of the cord proper at the second lumbar vertebra, beyond which, under the name of the filum terminale (mostly pia but little cord), it extends to the base of the sacrum. From the lateral margins of the cord (pia) saw-teeth-like processes pass outward to be attached by the apices of the teeth to the inner surface of the dura (and thus pin the arach- noid to the dura at these points). There are 21 of these teeth, and they are termed the ligamentum denticulatum. They serve to hold the cord steadily in its proper position within the centre of the spinal canal. The space between the arachnoid and the pia is the spinal subarachnoidean space and communicates with the similar spaces of the brain. It contains the cerebrospinal fluid, which can thus flow freely from the spinal canal into the subarachnoid spaces at the base of the brain, and thence by way of the foramen of Majendie into the ventricular cavi- ties of the same. The pia dips into the anterior and posterior fissures of the cord. The pia and arachnoid are connected by filaments of connective tissue constituting the subarachnoid tissue. It becomes thickened around the vessels which pass to (and from) the cord at its posterior fissure and here forms an in- complete partition called the septum. The Spinal Cord. Fig. 81. The spinal cord is 16 to 18 inches in length, ex- tending from the margin of the foramen magnum to the first or second lumbar vertebra. Its diameter is from two- to three-fifths of an inch. It weighs about one ounce.

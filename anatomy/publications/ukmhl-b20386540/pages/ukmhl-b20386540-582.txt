A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY, 580 downward to supply the front and outer side of the muscles of the thigh. A long branch reaches to the outer side of the knee and anastomoses with the superior external articular branch from the popHteal. Other branches in front extend to the knee joint and at the inner side anasto- mose with the deep branch of the anastomotica magna. (2) The Internal Circumflex arises from the inner and back part of the profunda artery near its origin. It passes backward between the tendon of the psoas and pectineus, then between the adductor brevis and the obturator ex- ternus, and continues between the quadratus femoris and the adductor magnus to the back of the thigh, where it anastomoses with the sciatic, external cutaneous, and the first perforating artery of the profunda, thus forming the crucial anastomosis.'* In its course the internal circum- flex supplies the muscles adjacent to it, the hip joint, anastomoses with the obturator artery, and gives off a branch of considerable size which follows the tendon of the obturator externus muscle to the back of the hip joint (above and behind the quadratus femoris) to anastomose with the sciatic, and gluteal arteries. (3) The Perforating" Arteries.â€”There are three of these given off from the profunda, and counting the termination of that vessel itself, makes four. The three perforating are branches from the profunda as it lies behind the ad- ductor longus muscle. They all pass through the adductor magnus (the two upper ones in addition piercing the ad- ductor brevis) by means of aponeurotic openings close to the bone, and appear upon the back of the adductor mag- nus where they form a chain of anastomoses with each other. In addition the first artery anastomoses with the sciatic, internal circumflex and the external circumflex, the third perforating with the termination of the profunda,

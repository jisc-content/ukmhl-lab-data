417 THE PERINEUM, MALE. Nerve Supply.—Dorsal nerve of the penis. Action.—To compress the membranous urethra, which it surrounds, expelling its contents (urine or semen). To aid erection by compressing the emergent veins of the penis. To compress Cowper's glands and so force out their secre- tion. This may be independent of the emission of semen or in connection with that act. Cowper's Glands. Diag. 28. These are two glands about as large as small peas, situated between the two layers of the triangular ligament, close to and behind the membranous urethra, and under (above) the bulb of the penis. The duct of a gland is about an inch long. It pierces the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, the corpus spongiosum, and opens into the floor of the urethra (bul- bous portion). DISSECTION. Carefully remove the compressor urethrse muscle and the nerve and artery and their branches. Remove the hemorrhoidal vessels and nerves. Section a portion of the gluteus maximus. The Posterior Layer of the Triangular Ligament. See page 402. The Anal Fascia. See page 402. DISSECTION. Remove the posterior layer of the triangular ligament and the anal fascia (which are continuous, as explained). Levator Ani. Fig. 83. Origin.—From the inner surface of the body of the pubis, from the angle between the obturator and recto- vesical fasciae—the so-called ''white Hne "—and from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium. 27

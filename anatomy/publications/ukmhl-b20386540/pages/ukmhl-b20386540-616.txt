614 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. funda (below), the external circumflex, and the internal circumflex upon the outer and inner sides of the femur. This arrangement of < communicating branches constitutes the crucial anastomosis." The student must not expect to find the inosculating branches forming any well defined ''cross." However, as one artery (the sciatic) is above, another (first perforating) is below, and two others upon either side (the external and internal circumflex) a some- what ''cross-shaped" anastomosis is formed. (5) Within the pelvis the sciatic gives twigs to the adjacent muscles, nerves, and pelvic viscera. The Great Sacrosciatic Ligament. Figs. 126, 114. This is a very strong band of fibres extending from the posterior, superior, and inferior iliac spines, and from the side and posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx to the inner margin of the tuberosity of the ischium, along which it is prolonged as a long curved band (the falciform pro- cess) for an inch and a half A part of the fibres of the great sacrosciatic ligament pass into the tendon of the long head of the biceps (flexor biceps femoris). This muscle then may be said to take an origin from the surface from which this ligament rises. The great sacrosciatic ligament converts the small sacro- sciatic notch into a foramen (assisted by the small ligament of the same name). From the posterior surface of the ligament the gluteus maximus arises ; from the anterior surface some fibres of the pyriformis. To the outer margin the deeper lamina of the fascia lata is attached ; at its inner border it becomes continuous with the obturator fascia.

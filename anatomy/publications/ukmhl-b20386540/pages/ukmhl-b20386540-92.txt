This vein is formed just at the base of the skull by the junction of the inferior petrosal (anterior) and lateral (pos- terior) sinuses. Diags. i, 5. Its course is along the posterior surface of the internal and common carotid arteries to behind the sternoclavicular articulation, where it is joined by the subclavian, to form the innominate vein. See page 99. In its course it receives veins corresponding to the branches of the external carotid artery. It is also connected by communicating veins with the external and internal jugular veins. DISSECTION. The internal jugular vein should be tied off and divided about two inches from the clavicle, and as high toward the head as possible, and the intervening portion with all its tributaries removed. Keep in mind that the thoracic duct opens into the angle at the junction of the internal jugular and the subclavian veins. The description of the duct is given with the dissection of the thorax. The External Carotid. Figs. 16, 17, 18. This is the outer branch of the common carotid. It ex- tends from the bifurcation of the common carotid at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage to behind the neck of the inferior maxilla, where it divides into the temporal and internal maxillary arteries. At its beginning it lies anterior to the internal carotid, and at its termination superficial to the same. The natural guide to the artery is the anterior border of the sternomastoid muscle.

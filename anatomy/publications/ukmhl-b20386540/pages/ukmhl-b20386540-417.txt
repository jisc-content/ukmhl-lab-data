THE PERINEUM, MALE. 415 the g-lans. (See dissection, page 440.) It is a heart- shaped enlargement, which spreads out laterally and back- ward beyond the crura, which terminate within it. The margin of the glans is called the corona glandis, and the constricted portion behind it the neck of the penis. The glans shows a vertical slit at its extreme end, the external urinary meatus. The posterior dilatation is named the bulb. It is about one and one-half inches long, and pro- jects a little beyond the membranous urethra, which enters this portion of the corpus spongiosum. The bulb lies upon (really below) the anterior triangular ligament, being sur- rounded by the accelerator urinse muscle and covered by the perineal fascia. The portion of the corpus spongiosum between the glans and bulb is called the body. Through its centre the ure- thra passes, the space between the urethra and sheath of the corpus being filled with erectile tissue. The corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum are bound together by the elastic fascial sheath of the penis, which extends from the root of the penis to the glans. Within this elastic sheath are found the deep dorsal nerves, arteries, and vein of the penis, while external to it are the superficial dorsal vessels and nerves. The former arteries and nerves are from the internal pudic artery and nerve ; the vein emp- ties into the prostatic sinus plexus. The latter vessels are from the external superficial and deep pudic arteries ; the veins open into their venae comites, and the nerves are branches of the iliohypogastric. See page 440. Beneath the skin and external to the fibrous sheath lies a membranous layer composed of fibrous and muscular tissue—the dartos—which is continuous with the similar layer of the scrotum and the fascia of Scarpa.

In the female the rectovesical fascia encloses the vagina and forms a sheath for it similar to the prostate in the male. The Anal (Ischiorectal) Fascia. Diags. 27, 28. Fig. 82. This is a thin layer which covers the lower surface of the levator ani muscle and coccygeus muscles. Laterally, it is attached to the obturator fascia close under the orie^in of the levator ani muscle from the ''white line;" behind, it blends with the obturator fascia ; in front, it becomes con- tinuous with the triangular ligament; centrally, it passes into the fibrous tissue about the anus. The prismatic-shaped cavity which is left between the lower part of the obturator fascia and the anal fascia is called the ischiorectal fossa. The Deep Layer of the Triangular Ligament. Diags. 26, 27, 28. Posteriorly, this ligament becomes continuous with the anal fascia (also the superficial layer of the triangular liga- ment and the perineal fascia, as will appear later). Later- ally, it is attached all along the inner margin of the rami of the ischium and pubes ; anteriorly, to the subpubic ligament, leaving here an opening for the single dorsal vein of the penis. The upper surface of the deep layer of the triangular ligament is continuous at the anterior margin of the levator ani muscle with the rectovesical fascia, which here forms the capsule for the prostate gland. The prostate gland rests upon this portion of the triangular ligament as on a shelf The triangular ligament (deep portion) is perforated at its apex by the dorsal vein of the penis ; at its base centrally, by the membranous urethra ; at its base laterally, by the pudic artery, vein, and dorsal nerve of the penis.

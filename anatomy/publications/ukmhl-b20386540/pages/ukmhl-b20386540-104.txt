A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 104 of the ganglion of the trunk, passes downward and forward under both external and internal carotids to the side of the larynx, where it divides into two branches. The superior, larger, internal, or sensory branch enters the larynx through the thyrohyoid membrane with the laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid artery and sup- pHes sensation to the mucous membrane of the interior of the larynx. It communicates with the inferior laryngeal nerve. The inferior, smaller, external, or motor branch descends to terminate in the cricothyroid muscle, which it supplies. From this branch are some fine filaments of communica- tion to the sympathetic and pharyngeal plexus. {c) The recurrent laryngeal or inferior laryngeal: The right one is given off as the pneumogastric turns over the subclavian artery, the left as it passes in front of the arch of the aorta. See page 342. In the neck they both pass behind the common carotids and inferior thyroid arteries, then in the groove between the trachea and the oesophagus, where they are covered by the thyroid gland, then under the lower border of the inferior constrictor, where they enter the interior of the larynx and are distributed to all the muscles of that organ excepting the cricothyroid. The recurrent nerve also furnishes small branches to the trachea, oesophagus, inferior constrictor, inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion, and the cardiac plexus. (d^ The cervical cardiac branches. For the Thoracic, see page 354. There are one or two upper cervical cardiac branches which join the cardiac branches of the sympathetic. See page 106. There is one lower, which comes off the pneumogastric

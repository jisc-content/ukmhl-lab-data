473 THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. mesentery, mesorectum ; and lig-ament, the process of peri- toneum that connects and supports organs not parts of the alimentary canal, as the ligaments of the liver, uterus, etc. ; exceptions are the gastrophrenic and costocolic ligaments. The hollows formed by the reflections of the peritoneum are called fossae, the position being indicated by the names of the parts between which the fossa is formed, as recto- vesical fossa. The anterior parietal layer of peritoneum has been ex- posed. It is seen to cover the abdominal organs and reach from the pelvic cavity to the under side of the diaphragm. Attention has already been called to the fact that the peri- toneum can be raised from the iliac fossae, exposing the vessels there. The membrane is now to be opened by an incision from the ensiform to the symphysis at the left of the middle Hne, and one horizontally across just below the umbilicus. Reflect the four segments. Attached to the right upper one are two ligaments of the liver. Save these. Diag. 40. To follow the peritoneum, the membrane is seen lining the under surface of the diaphragm to the posterior portion ; it then is reflected on to the liver and the oesophageal end of the stomach, forming the anterior layer of the coronary and lateral ligaments of the liver and the g'astrophrenic ligament of the stomach ; then, covering the upper surface of the liver, the peritoneum turns over its anterior border to line its under surface as far backward as the point of entrance of the hepatic vessels ; at this place the membrane descends to the lesser curvature of the stomach, forming the anterior layer of the gastrohepatic omentum. The peritoneum covers the entire anterior surface of the stomach and first portion of the duodenum, and from the greater curvature of the former and front of the latter this

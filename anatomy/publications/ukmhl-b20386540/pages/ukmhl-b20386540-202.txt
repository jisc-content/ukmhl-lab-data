A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 202 ward through the cavernous sinus to the sphenoidal fissure, through which it passes. See pages 43, 46, 57. (The deep origin of the nerve is from a nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle.) 7. The Facial Nerve. Figs. 29, 53, 10, 11, 12. The facial arises from the groove between the pons and the medulla at the outer side of the olivary body. The nerve enters the internal auditory meatus with the eighth nerve, traverses the Fallopian canal, and emerges at the base of the skull through the stylomastoid foramen. See page 61. Shortly after entering the canal the nerve is slightly thickened ; this is called the geniculate ganglion. From this ganglion are given off the greater, lesser, and external superficial petrosal nerves. The great superficial petrosal nerve passes through the hiatus Fallopii and then runs forward and inward to the foramen lacerum medium, pierces the cartilage which fills in this opening, joins the deep petrosal nerve, and forms the Vidian nerve. See page 151. The lesser superficial petrosal nerve passes through a small opening external to the hiatus Fallopii, runs forward and inward, and leaves the skull through the foramen ovale to terminate in the otic ganglion. Seepage 119. The external superficial petrosal nerve traverses a minute hole external to the above-mentioned foramina and terminates in the sympathetic plexus on the middle menin- geal artery. Below the geniculate ganglion the facial nerve gives off the following minute twigs : one to the stapedius muscle, another communicating with the pneumogastric, and a larger branch—the chorda tympani—which courses

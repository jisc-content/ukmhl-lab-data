{From a preparation in the Museum of the University Medical College.') Fig. II. The Course, Relations, and Distribution of the Cranial Nerves.â€” I, Optic nerve. 2, The internal carotid artery. 3, The sixth cranial nerve. 4, Third cranial nerve. 5, Fourth cranial nerve. 6, Fifth cranial nerve, vi^ith the Gasserian ganglion. Its divisions into the ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxil- lary branches is clearly show^n. The course of these branches with their terminal divisions or distributions can easily be traced. To indicate each small branch on the photograph would ruin it. 7, The facial nerve. The geniculate ganglion and branches, the chorda tympani (passing downward and forward to join the gustatory nerve), and the terminal divisions and their branches are all shown. 8, Spinal accessory passing upward to the foramen magnum. 9, Same nerve in the neck. 10, Pneumogastric nerve. II, Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 12, Internal carotid artery. Notice the various sympa- thetic plexuses upon it. 13, Superior cervical ganglion. 14, Ophthalmic ganglion. 15, Supra-orbital nerve. 16, Lachrymal gland. 17, Meckel's ganglion. 18, Infra-orbital nerve. 19, Mental nerve. 20, Internal pterygoid muscle. 21, Frontal sinus. The student is urged to study the relations within the orbit and the three great trunks of the fifth nerve.

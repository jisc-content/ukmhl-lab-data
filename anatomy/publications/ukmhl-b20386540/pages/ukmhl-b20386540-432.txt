Draw the rectum backward and separate it from the vagina until the recto- vesical fold of peritoneum passing between them is reached. Notice how far this fold reaches downward into the rectum and vagina. In like manner separate the vagina from the urethra and base of the bladder. Expose the ureters, and carefully note their position with reference to the uterus, vagina, and bladder. The Rectum. See page 421. For the description of the rectovesical fascia^ see page 399.

The Thyroid Gland. Fig. 18. The thyroid gland is a ductless gland, composed of two symmetrical halves, which are joined by a narrow^ isthmus. The halves, or lobes, of the gland rest upon the antero- external surface of the trachea, and the isthmus crosses its front. Each lobe is about two inches long, and one and one- half inches broad, and three-fourths of an inch thick. The lower end of the lobe is broader than its upper end. Its antero-external surface is convex, and its inner surface adapted to the trachea, against which it rests. It reaches from the fifth or sixth tracheal ring upward to cover the lower fourth of the thyroid cartilage. The isthmus is about one-half an inch wide and crosses the second and third tracheal rings. The entire gland weighs from one to two ounces, and is usually heavier in females than males.

220 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, posteriorly with the pia, from which it originally springs. The velum interpositum forms the covering or roof for the third ventricle. Its margins project into the cavity of the lateral ventricles and are composed of masses of capillaries called the choroid plexuses of these ventricles. In a similar manner from the under surface of the velum festoons of capillaries hang downward into the cavity of the third ventricle and furnish the choroid plexuses for that ventricle. As stated above, the velum is a portion of the pia which seems to be contained within the ventricular cavity of the brain. But such is not really the case, for though it projects into the ventricles of the brain it carries in front of it a covering of epithelium which is the attenuated remains of the roof of the primitive vesicles of the brain. This layer covers the velum and the choroid plexuses and becomes continuous with the walls forming the boundaries of the ventricles and so shuts the velum and choroid plexuses out of the cerebral ventricles. Diag. 15. The velum interpositum with its lining layer of epithe- lial cells (which represents the primitive roof of the brain) is called the tela choroidea superior, and the portion of the pia which reaches from the under surface of the cere- bellum to the upper surface of the medulla, and forms the covering for the posterior portion of the fourth ventricle, is called the tela choroidea inferior. The Deep Cerebral Veins. (a) The vein of the corpus striatum collects the blood from the corpus striatum, optic thalamus, fornix, septum lucidum, courses forward and inward in the groove between the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus, and terminates at the entrance of the foramen of Monro.

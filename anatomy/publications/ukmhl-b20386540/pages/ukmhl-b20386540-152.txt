A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 152 mucous membrane of the middle and inferior meatuses and inferior turbinated bone of the nose, {b) The small or posterior palatine nerve traverses the lesser or accessory palatine canal to reach and supply the soft palate, the tonsil and the uvula ; also the levator palati and the azygos uvulae muscles, (c) The external palatine nerve. A very small filament extends through the external palatine canal to supply the tonsil and the soft palate. (3) The internal branches. {d) The superior nasal branches, six or seven filaments, passing through the sphenopalatine foramen to supply the mucous membrane covering the posterior part of the middle and superior tur- binated bones and the posterior ethmoidal cells, (b) The septal branch—nasopalatine, or nerve of Cotunnius— crosses the roof of the nose to the septum, runs down- ward and forward buried in the mucous membrane of the septum, which it supplies, to terminate after passing through the anteroposterior pair of foramina (Scarpa's) in the mucous membrane of the roof of the mouth. (The left nerve takes the anterior, the right the posterior foramen.) (4) The posterior branch has already been described as the Vidian nerve. See above. THE BRAIN. The Membranes of the Brain. The membranes of the brain are the dura, arachnoid, and the pia. The dura has already been described. See page 32. The Subdural Space.—The space between the dura and the following membrane—the arachnoid—is called the subdural space.

66 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, The Parotid Gland. Figs. 3, 14. This is a large salivary gland, which fills up the space below the zygoma, and between the ramus of the lower jaw and the auditory and mastoid processes, and extends downward as low as the level of the angle of the jaw. Its lobes extend forward (pterygoid), upward (glenoid), and inward (carotid), between the surrounding structures. One portion usually detached and lying upon the masseter muscle is the socia parotidis, which connects with the paro- tid duct by a separate opening. The duct of the parotid gland is Stenson's. It passes forward across the masseter half an inch below the zygoma, pierces the buccinator muscle, and opens into the mouth opposite the second upper molar tooth. Figs. 2, 3, 4. The gland is covered by the extension upward of the cervical fascia called the parotid fascia. See page 59. It is separated from the submaxillary gland by the stylo- maxillary ligament. Page 59. Within the parotid are found the facial nerve and its primary divisions and branches (forming the pes anserinus) ; the termination of the external carotid artery, its posterior auricular branch, the beginning of the internal maxillary and the temporal arteries ; the transverse facial from the temporal, as also the glandular branches from these arteries to the parotid itself; and the temporomaxillary vein. The arterial supply is from the arteries within the gland, the nerve supply from the seventh, great auricular, auriculotemporal, and sympathetic plexus on the carotid artery. The veins open into the temporomaxillary sinus. The lymphatics empty into the superficial and deep lymphatic glands of the neck.

The heart will be seen to be contained in a similar membranous sac, the pericardium, though it is much stronger than the pleurae. The space between the lungs (and pleurse), sternum, and spine, and reaching from the root of the neck to the diaphragm, is the mediastinum. The Mediastinum. Figs. 68 to 72. The mediastinal space is the central portion of the thoracic cavity between the pleural sacs laterally, the ster- num and cartilages in front, the vertebral column behind, the diaphragm below, and the superior aperture of the thorax above. The mediastinum is divided into several portions, as the superior, anterior, middle, and posterior. The superior mediastinum lies behind the first piece of the sternum. In front are the sternal origins of the sterno- hyoid and sternothyroid muscles ; behind, are the four upper dorsal vertebrae and the longus colli muscle. It contains the trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct; trans- verse aorta, innominate artery, the thoracic portions of the left carotid (common), and subclavian arteries ; the innomi- nate veins, the upper portion of the superior vena cava ; the pneumogastric, left recurrent laryngeal, the phrenic, sym- pathetic, and cardiac nerves ; lymphatic and thymus glands ; longus coUi, sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles. The anterior mediastinum is all that portion of the mediastinum anterior to the pericardium. It corresponds to the area of heart dullness. It contains a little areolar tissue and a few small lymphatic glands. The middle mediastinum is the central portion of the space. It contains the heart, ascending aorta, pulmonary

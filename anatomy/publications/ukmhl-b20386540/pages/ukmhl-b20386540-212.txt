The hippocampus minor is an elevation along the inner wall of the posterior horn, formed by the involution of the brain corresponding to the calcarine fissure. The bulb of the posterior horn is a bulging in the pos- terior horn above and parallel with the hippocampus minor produced by the bundle of fibres—the forceps major—which is proceeding from the splenium of the corpus callosum to the occipital lobe. The floor of the anterior horn and body of the ventricle present from before backward the caudate nucleus (the intraventricular portion of the corpus striatum), the taenia semicircularis, the optic thalamus, choroid plexus, and posterior pillar of the fornix. The floor of the posterior horn is a flat surface behind but becomes gradually elevated as the floor passes into the descending horn ; this raise is the eniinentia collateralis, and is produced by the upheaval of the brain over the collateral fissure. The middle or descending horn of the lateral ventricle : The course of this extension of the cavity of the lateral ventricle is backward, outward, and downward, then forward, downward, and inward to the anterior extremity of the temporal lobe. The roof of the horn is formed by that portion of the body of the corpus callosum passing to the temporal lobe and is called the tapetum, also by the tail of the caudate nucleus and the taenia semicircularis. At the extreme anterior portion the roof is formed by the amygdaloid nucleus in which the tail of the caudate nucleus and the taenia semicircularis terminate. Figs. 36, 37. The inner wall presents a long, rounded eminence—the

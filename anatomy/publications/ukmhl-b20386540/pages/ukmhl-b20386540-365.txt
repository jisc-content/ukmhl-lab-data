UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, POSTERIOR. 363 Insertion.—Into the posterior portion of the upper surface and border of the outer third of the clavicle ; into the upper border of the spine and acromion process and the slight tubercle near the base of the spine of the scapula. Nerve Supply.—The spinal accessory and deep branches of the third and fourth cervical nerves. They are distrib- uted to the anterior surface of the muscle. Action.—The spine and head being the fixed points and both muscles acting, the shoulders will be drawn backward and the points of the shoulders slightly elevated. The muscles acting singly and in parts from the fixed spine : if the upper portion acts, the clavicle and acromion will be raised (shoulder elevated) ; if the middle portion of the muscle acts, the scapula will be drawn toward the spine, a slight rotation taking place at the same time ; if the lower portion acts, the vertebral border of the spine will be drawn downward (the shoulder carried downward and backward), at the same time the point of the shoulder is very slightly elevated. Acting from the shoulder as the fixed point, both muscles will retract the head and neck and elevate the chin ; one muscle acting, will carry the chin to the opposite side and flex the neck laterally. The muscle fixing the shoulders gives the accessory muscles of inspiration a better chance for acting. The Deltoid. Fig. 60. Origin.—From the anterior border of the outer third of the clavicle, from the outer margin of the acromion, lower lip of the spine of the scapula, and the infraspinatus fascia. Insertion.—For a distance of two or three inches into the outer surface of the humerus just above its middle, at a rough triangular surface.

THE BRAIN, 177 By the growth of the brain at a much faster rate above and below this depression its depth is increased, and as the brain becomes larger the fissure becomes deeper and longer, extending backward (the horizontal limb) with the backward prolongation of the forebrain. Thus the fissure is formed by the excessive growth of parts of the cerebrum about a very slowly growing portion, so at the last the slowly grow- ing portion is covered in by the more rapidly growing por- tions, and there is left between them a fissure which leads to the former part of the brain (in this case to the insula). As an example of the third class of depressions—sulci —we will consider the formation of the fissure or sulcus of Rolando. The first appearance of the fissure of Rolando is between the fifth and sixth months, and it is produced by the growth of the cortex of the cerebrum on either side of a linear depression at a faster rate than the cortex grows along the line of the depression itself. The result is to form a deep fissure. All the rest of the third class of sulci are formed in this manner—by the upgrowth of the cortex at a faster rate along certain lines than along other lines, these up- growths being called convolutions and the depressions sulci. The Formation of the Velum Interpositum and the Choroid Plexuses.—(Diags. 13 to 16.) Go back to the time when there are the three primary vesicles ; cover them with the vascular membrane, which is to become the adult pia. Now remember how the forebrain grows backward, taking with it the lamina terminalis (corpus callosum), so as to cover in the middle vesicle. The forebrain does cover in the middle vesicle or that portion of it which we call its roof, but upon this roof rests the vascular membrane (which later we designate as the velum interpositum), so at the end of the process the velum interpositum is found within the brain, 12

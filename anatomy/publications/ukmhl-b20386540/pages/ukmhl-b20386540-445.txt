THE ABDOMEN, EXTERIOR. 443 abdominal wall. How these coverings are secured is ex- plained later ; only their names can be given now. First is the dartos, as already described. Second, the external sper- matic fascia. Third, the cremasteric fascia. Fourth, the infundibuliform fascia. Fifth, the extraperitoneal tissue. In addition to these the testicle has a partial envelope formed of peritoneum, called the tunica vaginalis. Of these various layers only the first, third, and last can be demonstrated apart from their seurces. For the first, see page 406 ; for the second, page 460 ; the last, the tunica vaginalis, is a covering the testicle has acquired from the peritoneum, see page 460. It consists of two layers ; the visceral, enveloping the testicle, except at its posterior part; and the parietal, forming the walls of the sac contain- ing the gland. DISSECTION. Open the tunica vaginalis and recognize the following parts ; The testicle proper and the epididymis. The tunica albuginea (Fig. 93) is the dense white fibrous covering of the testicle. At the posterior margin of the testicle there is an extension from this capsule into the body of the gland of a fibrous septum called the mediasti- num, from which radiate secondary septa dividing the organ into lobes. The epididymis lies at the back of the testicle and is divided into the head or globus major, the body, and the tail or globus minor, from which the vas deferens extends. See page 542.

Origin.â€”From the outer surface and lower margin of the eight lower ribs, by muscular slips that interdigitate, the three lower ones with the latissimus dorsi, the rest with the serratus magnus.

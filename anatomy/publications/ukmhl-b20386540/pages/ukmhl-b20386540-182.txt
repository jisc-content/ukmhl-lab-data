A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 182 angle lies the portion of the cortex which is external to the corpus striatum. As growth proceeds and the cortex above and below overlaps more and more the central depressed portion, the fissure assumes a linear appearance. This is the horizontal limb of the adult fissure. About the fifth month an offset from the main fissure appears ; this ultimately becomes the vertical limb of the adult fissure. In the adult the fissure of Sylvius begins at the base of the brain at the outer part of a perforated layer (anterior perforated space), passes outward, backward, and slightly upward until near its terminus, when it turns abruptly up- ward to end in the parietal lobe. This is the main, or horizontal limb of the fissure. Fig. 24. From the anterior part of the horizontal limb a short (one inch long) fissure extends forward and upward into the frontal lobe ; this is the ascending or vertical limb of the fissure of Sylvius. Sometimes this fissure is bifid and one part extends directly forward for a short distance into the frontal lobe, forming the anterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius. The fissure of Sylvius serves to separate the frontal and parietal lobes above from the temporal lobe below. The Fissure of Rolando. Figs, i, 7, 23, 24, 26. This fissure appears between the fifth and sixth months of foetal development. It belongs to the class of fissures which are formed by the heaping up of the cortical portion of the cerebrum itself. It is found grooving the outer surface of the cerebrum about at its middle. Its course is down- ward and forward from about the middle of the great lon- gitudinal fissure, into which it frequently opens, to near the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It forms an

524 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. On the outside, the right Hes against the Hver for its upper three-fourths, the left against the spleen for about the same extent. Above, the suprarenal bodies rest upon the upper and inner margin of the kidneys. On the inner side are the arteries, veins, and exit of the ureters. The arteries are derived from the Aorta. The veins empty into the Vena Cava. The nerves are derived from the solar and aortic plexuses. The lymphatics empty into the receptaculum chyli. The Suprarenal Bodies. Figs. io6, 107. These small triangular glands are found resting upon the upper and inner borders of the kidneys. Their base is about one and three-fourths inches, their height about one and one-fourth inches. The right suprarenal body is behind the liver, duodenum, and in contact with the vena cava, the left behind the stomach, pancreas, splenic artery, and has the spleen to the outer side. The arteries are from the Aorta^ Inferior Phrenic, and Renal. The veins empty into the vena cava, or renal. The nerves are derived from the same source as the kidney. The lymphatics pass to the renal glands. The kidneys and suprarenal bodies are behind the peritoneum. The Ureters. Figs. 105 to 107, 112. Are the excretory ducts of the kidneys, and pass down- ward to empty into the base of the bladder. They are from twelve to sixteen inches long, and below the kidney one-sixth of an inch in diameter. At the kidney they become expanded to form the sinus, into which the calices empty. In its course to the bladder the ureter crosses the psoas muscle, genitocrural nerve, common iliac artery and vein. It lies behind the peritoneum, and is crossed by the

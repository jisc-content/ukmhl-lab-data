THE THORAX. Relations.—Right: In front, sternal origins of the sterno- hyoid and sternothyroid muscles, clavicle, first costal carti- lage, and remains of the thymus gland ; behind, pleura and lung ; to the right, pleura, lung, and phrenic nerve (right) ; to the left, right subclavian artery and pneumo- gastric nerve, the innominate artery, and trachea. The left: In front, sternohyoid and sternothyroid mus- cles, manubrium, clavicle, sternoclavicular articulation, re- mains of thymus gland ; behind, innominate, left carotid and subclavian arteries, trachea, left phrenic nerve, left pneumogastric nerve; below, the transverse aorta ; above, the cervical fascia and inferior thyroid veins. Tributaries.—Both receive the internal jugular, subcla- vian, vertebral, deep cervical, and inferior thyroid veins above, and the internal mammary below. The left vein also receives the left superior intercostal, thymic, medias- tinal, pericardiac veins, and the thoracic duct; the right, the right lymphatic duct. The ducts empty into the in- nominate veins at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian. The Superior Vena Cava. Fig. 70. Diags. 21, 22. This is formed in the first intercostal space close to the right side of the sternum by the junction of the right and left innominate veins. Its course is downward to the right auricle of the heart, into which it opens. Relations.—In front, first and second intercostal spaces and the second costal cartilage, remains of the thymus gland, pericardium, pleura, and right lung ; behind, azygos major, right bronchus, right pulmonary artery, and right superior pulmonary vein, the pericardium ; to the right, phrenic nerve, lung, and pleura ; to the left, ascending aorta, innominate artery.

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 256 to join the acromion process of the scapula, and thus hinge the upper extremity to the thorax. The articulation between the clavicle and the acromion is usually easily found, and often is so prominent as to consti- tute almost a subluxation of the former upon the latter. The margin of the acromion can be traced, and the angle formed by the junction of the spine with the acromion is always easily located. This point is the one from which measurements are made in determining differences in the length of the upper extremity. The lower fixed points depend upon the part to be measured. If only the arm, the external condyle of the humerus or the tip of the olec- ranon with the forearm flexed to a right angle. For the arm and forearm, the tape is carried to the tip of the styloid process of the radius or ulna, and for the entire extremity, to the point of the middle finger (any finger or point will do provided the corresponding point is taken on the opposite side of the body). In front of the middle and outer thirds of the clavicle is usually a depression corresponding to the interval between the pectoraHs major and deltoid muscles ; in this depression the tip of the coracoid process will be found by making a little pressure. The cephahc vein lies in the groove between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles and passes upward to empty into the axillary vein below the middle of the clavicle. The deltoid tubercle may be prominent enough to be dis- cerned by touch at the outer and middle thirds of the anterior border of the bone. Under the deltoid muscle the tuber- osities of the humerus can be felt, especially on rotation of the bone. The greater is external, the lesser internal, and between them is the bicipital groove, which can be appreciated in thin people.

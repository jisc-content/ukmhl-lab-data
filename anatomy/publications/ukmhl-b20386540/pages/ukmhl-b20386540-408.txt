A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 406 layer of the superficial fascia. All these terms are applied to the membranous lamina of the superficial fascia, which covers over the structures forming, and contained within, the perineal triangle. It is attached behind to the base of the triangular ligament, curving backward over the trans- verse perinei muscle to do so ; laterally, to the inner margin of the rami of the ischium and pubes external to the attachment of the superficial layer of the triangular liga- ment. Forward, it passes over the bulb of the 'penis into the scrotum, where it receives a reinforcement of involun- tary muscular fibres, and is called the dartos of the scrotum (it is also continuous with the dartos of the penis or labium majus). After leaving the scrotum (and penis or labium majus) it passes upward to become continuous with the deep layer of the superficial (Scarpa's) fascia of the abdo- men over the spermatic cord (round ligament) at the exter- nal abdominal ring. The perineal fascia, after surrounding the scrotum and penis (as the dartos), becomes attached to the front of the symphysis pubis as explained on page 438, forming the suspensory lig'ament of the penis, or clitoris. The Anus. Figs. 82, 85. The anus is the opening of the bowel externally. The lower part of the rectum and the anus is surrounded by circular muscle fibres, the external sphincter, that wrinkles the skin into radiating Hues. For this muscle see below. The Inferior Pudendal Nerve, or Nerve of Soemmering. Fig. 82. This nerve is a branch from the small sciatic under the gluteus maximus ; it winds forward around the tuberosity of the ischium, perforates the deep layer of the superficial fascia about an inch external to the tuberosity, passes for-

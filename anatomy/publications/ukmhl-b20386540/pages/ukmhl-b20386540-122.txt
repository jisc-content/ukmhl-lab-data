A MANUAL OF AAA TO MY. 122 The sphenomaxillary, or third portion :â€” (1) Branches which supply the molar and bicuspid teeth, mucous membrane of the antrum, and twigs to the gums, given off from the internal maxillary upon the back of the superior maxilla. (2) The infra-orbital. This runs forward with the superior maxillary nerve through the infra-orbital canal, and appears upon the face through the infra-orbital foramen, where it breaks up into branches to the surrounding muscles and in- tegument of the upper lip, lower eye-lid, and to the lachry- mal sac. Within the canal it supplies orbital branches to inferior obHque and rectus muscles ; the anterior dental, to the canine and incisive teeth and mucous membrane of the antrum ; and the nasal branch to the mucous membrane of the nose. (3) The superior palatine artery. Its course is down through the posterior palatine canal, along the roof of the mouth, and up through Stenson's foramen into the nose to anastomose with the nasopalatine artery. It supplies the soft palate, tonsils, and mucous membrane of the mouth. (4) The Vidian artery. Runs backward through the Vidian canal, supplying the Eustachian tube and roof of pharynx. (5) The pterygopalatine. A twig through the pterygo- palatine canal to the roof of the pharynx. (6) The nasal, or nasopalatine. Passes through the sphenopalatine foramen to supply the ethmoidal cells, frontal sinus, and antrum. The continuation of the artery extends forward and downward upon the vomer and termi- nates by anastomosing with the anterior terminus of the superior palatine artery, through Stenson's foramen.

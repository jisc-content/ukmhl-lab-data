A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY, 582 which is called the fourth perforating artery. It passes through a similar gap in the adductor magnus close to its insertion and just above the opening for the femoral artery, to the back of the adductor magnus, where it forms an anastomosis with the third perforating, and the superior muscular and articular branches of the popliteal. All the perforating arteries supply the muscles near them. Subcmreus. The innermost fibres of the crureus which pass to the synovial membrane of the knee joint. Its function is to keep the synovial membrane raised up out of the way of the patella. Obturator Externus. Fig. 120. Origin,—From the inner portion of the external surface of the obturator membrane, and from the adjacent portions of the rami of the pubes and ischium. Insertion,—Into the digital fossa of the great trochanter. Nerve Supply.—Posterior division of the obturator nerve. Action,—To adduct the thigh, to rotate the thigh out- ward, to flex the thigh. This is the muscle which should have been called the sartorius " as it is the muscle which crosses the legs. The Obturator Nerve. Figs. 119, 120. For its formation, and course through the pelvis, see page 534. The nerve emerges into the thigh through the obturator gap in the obturator membrane along with the obturator artery. It divides into two branches, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior bra7tch passes over the upper mar- gin of the obturator externus, over the adductor brevis, and under the pectineus and adductor longus muscles.

THE NECK, ANTERIOR. 125 sides of the posterior nares, mouth, and larynx ; behind, it rests upon the prevertebral fascia ; and below, is continued into the oesophagus. For the (Esophagus, see Thorax. The Pharyngeal Plexus. This is a loose meshed plexus of fine nerve filaments formed upon the outer surface of the middle and inferior constrictor muscles by nerve fibres from the glossopharyn- geal, pneumogastric, and superior cervical ganglion. Inferior Constrictor. Oingin,—From the side of the cricoid cartilage, from the inferior cornu, the oblique line, and the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. Insertion.—Into the fibrous raphe of the pharynx. Its lower fibres pass horizontally, the upper, obliquely upward, backward, and inward. The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes upward under the lower border of the muscle, and the superior laryngeal per- forates the thyrohyoid membrane above the upper border of the muscle. Middle Constrictor. Origin.—From both cornua of the hyoid bone and the stylohyoid ligament. Insertion.—Into the median raphe of the pharynx. Its fibres run to the insertion; the lower, downward; the middle, horizontally ; the upper, upward. It is overlapped below by the inferior constrictor and in turn overlaps the superior above. Superior Constrictor. Origin.—From the side of the tongue and mucous membrane, from the posterior portion of the mylohyoid ridge, the pterygomaxillary Hgament, and the hamular process and lower portion of the internal pterygoid plate.

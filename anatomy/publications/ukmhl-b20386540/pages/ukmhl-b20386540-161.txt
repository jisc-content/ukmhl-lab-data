161 THE BRAIN. very small or wanting, and the other quite large to make up for the deficiency. When both are present the arterial circuit called the cwcle of Willis is formed. The arteries which form it are the two anterior cerebrals, which are united by the anterior communicating, the two middle cerebrals (or internal carotids), which are joined by the two posterior communicating vessels to the two posterior cere- brals. Within this circle are found the following structures at the base of the brain. The posterior perforated space, third and fourth nerves, the corpora albicantia or mammillaria, the tuber cinereum, infundibulum and pituitary body, the optic chiasm tracts and nerves, and the lamina cinerea. The function of the circle of Willis is to maintain an even supply of blood to all parts of the brain. The anastomoses of the opposite carotids through the anterior cerebrals and anterior communicating, and of the posterior cerebrals with each other, is so free that no trouble would arise from interference with one carotid or one vertebral. But the anastomosis of these two systems through the posterior communicating is not so free and constant, owing to the smallness of these arteries, or even the absence of one. As a rule, we find both of these arteries small, rarely find both large, often one may be quite good sized and the other very small or wanting entirely. In cases where there is not a free communication between the anterior and posterior parts of the circle of Willis it would evidently be dangerous to ligate both carotids at one operation. The cerebral blood-supply is divided into the vessels distributed to the base of the brain—ganglionic system,— and those to the outer surface of the cortex—cortical system. The blood supply to the brain differs from the blood 11

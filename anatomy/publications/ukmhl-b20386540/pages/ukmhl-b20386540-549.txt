THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 547 and inferior, which are distributed to the bladder. The superior gives off the deferential artery to the vas deferens (in the female a similar one to the round ligament), and at the bladder the obliterated hypogastric^ which in the foetus was pervious, {b) The middle hemorrhoidal. This sup- pHes the middle section of the rectum, anastomosing above with the superior hemorrhoidal from the inferior mesenteric and below with the inferior hemorrhoidal from the internal pudic. (c) Uterine. Supplies the lower section of the uterus ; the two arteries form an anastomosis around the neck of the cervix by the circular artery, {d ) The vag'inal. Four or five small arteries to the side of the vagina, {e) The obturator. It runs forward just below the nerve which it accompanies through the obturator canal. For the ter- minal distribution, see page 583. The pelvic branches are small, only one of them being of any size, viz. : the pubic, which anastomoses upon the inner surface of the pubes with the pubic branch of the deep epigastric. Frequently this anastomosis is by larger trunks, or the obturator may rise (one in three and a half cases) from the deep epigastric artery and pass to the obturator canal at the outer side of the femoral opening, or in a few cases (one in ten) the artery may encircle the femoral opening (likewise any pro- trusion through it, as femoral hernia) to gain the obturator canal around the inner side of the femoral opening. (/) The sciatic artery is the larger terminal branch of the ante- rior trunk of the internal iliac. It passes downward to leave the pelvis through the great sacrosciatic foramen, be- low the pyriformis muscle. For its continuation, see page 613. (^) The internal pudic, the smaller terminal branch, passes through the same opening with the sciatic, but above and internal to it. For the rest of the artery, see page 411.

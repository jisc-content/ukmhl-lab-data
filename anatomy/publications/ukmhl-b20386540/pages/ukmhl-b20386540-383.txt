UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, POSTERIOR. 381 terior annular ligament in a bunch. Lower down they separate to pass to their respective fingers. Across the knuckles the tendons of the three outer fingers are united by fibrous bands which diverge from the tendon of the ring finger to the tendons of the middle and little finger on either side. The insertion into the fingers is as follows :— From the side of each tendon a fibrous extension passes to the lateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal articu- lations. Beyond this each tendon divides into three slips. The middle slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, the two lateral slips pass forward to be inserted into the base of the last phalanx. Each tendon of the extensor communis digitorum re- ceives laterally the insertions of the lumbricales (see page 307) and the dorsal and palmar interossei muscles (^palmar, see page 309; dorsal, page 388). Nerve Supply.—The posterior interosseous (the filaments issue from the seventh cervical nerve). Action.—To extend the fingers, hand, and wrist, to slightly extend the forearm. Extensor Minimi Digiti. Fig. 78. Origin.—The same as the preceding, with which it unites for the upper third of its length. Insertion.—Into the tendon of the common extensor going to the little finger. Nerve Supply.—Same as the preceding. Action.—To extend the little finger, the hand, and the wrist, and a very feeble extensor of the elbow. Anconeus. Fig. 78. Origin.—-From the back of the external (epi) condyle of the humerus, and from the posterior ligament of the elbow- joint.

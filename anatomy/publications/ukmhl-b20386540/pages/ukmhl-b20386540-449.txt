THE ABDOMEN, EXTERIOR. 447 micturition, vomiting, parturition, expiration. If one acts it rotates the thorax to the same side, or the pelvis to the opposite side, and flexes the spine laterally. Both acting will flex the thorax upon the pelvis or the reverse. Nerve Supply. Page 453. DISSECTION. At the level of the anterior superior spine of the ilium make a small trans- verse cut through the aponeurosis of the external oblique, until the muscle beneath is seen. Insert a knife-handle or finger in this opening, and, raising the externa] oblique, divide it transversely toward the medial line, until the linea semilunaris is reached. Reflect the upper part of the muscle, first raising it carefully from the one beneath, and dividing its aponeurosis over the linea semilunaris ; cut away the two or three upper costal attachments of the muscle and turn it backward as far as it will go. The lower portion is to be turned back in a similar manner, dividing the aponeurosis as near the linea alba as convenient, and down to the pubis. This leaves a triangular flap attached by Poupart's ligament, and showing the external ring. Obliquus Interims Abdominis. Fig. 89. O^ngbi.—From the posterior layer of the lumbar fascia, from the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the iliac crest, and from the outer half of Poupart's ligament. Insertion.—By the conjoined tendon into the iliopectineal line and crest of the pubes, by its aponeurosis into the whole length of the linea alba from ensiform to symphysis, and by muscular fibres into the lower borders of the last three or four ribs. The conjoined tendon is formed by the union of the fibres of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, in- ternal to the middle of Poupart's ligament, into a common tendon, that is inserted into the iliopectineal line and crest of the pubes. The conjoined tendon lies directly back of the external abdominal ring, and strengthens this naturally weak spot. The fibres of the muscles passing into the con-

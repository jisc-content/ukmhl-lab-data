A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 118 of the posterior division. It descends behind (usually in- ternal to) the external pterygoid muscle, passes between the internal lateral ligament and ramus of the lower jaw, gives off its mylohyoid branch, and enters the inferior dental foramen. Its course is then through the inferior dental canal, supplying branches to the bone and teeth, until the mental foramen is reached, when it comes for- ward through it and terminates in the muscles and integu- ment of the front of the chin and the mucous membrane and skin of the lower lip. The inferior dental nerve has the inferior dental branch of the internal maxillary artery accompanying it in its course. The mylohyoid nerve passes downward and for- ward, grooving the inner surface of the lower jaw and lying upon (beneath) the mylohyoid muscle, to w^hich it gives branches, and terminates in the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. See page 8i. It is accompanied in the latter part of its course by the submental branch of the facial artery. (3) The lingual or gustatory nerve. Next in size to the inferior dental. Its course is the same as the inferior dental, lying internal to and in front of it, until the inferior dental foramen is reached. Here the lingual nerve con- tinues forward between the internal pterygoid muscle and the ramus of the lower jaw, then upon the mylo- hyoid muscle close to its origin, then between the mylo- hyoid and hyoglossus above the deep portion of the submaxillary gland (see page 86). It joins Wharton's duct on its lower side and passes with it to the tip of the tongue. Near its origin the lingual nerve is joined by the chorda tympani, and below the external pterygoid muscle is connected to the inferior dental nerve by a small branch.

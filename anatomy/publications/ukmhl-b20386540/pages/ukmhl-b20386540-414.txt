The latter continues the course of the internal pudic forward and upward, perforating the superficial layer of the triangular ligament close to the opening for the dorsal vein of the penis, then passes between the crura and symphysis pubis and through the suspensory ligament of the penis to the dorsal surface of that organ, where it lies external to the dorsal vein, which is centrally placed. It continues along the dorsum of the penis to the glans, where it ends by breaking up into a coronary anasto- mosis. It also sends branches to the prepuce. The dorsal artery is accompanied in its course by the nerve of the same name which is placed outside of the artery. Braiiclies of the Internal Pudic. (1) The inferior hemorrhoidal branch (or branches, i to 3) is given off as the pudic enters the rectovesical fossa. It passes through the fat, filling the fossa, to the rectum and anus. Above, it anastomoses with the middle hemor- rhoidal of the anterior division of the internal iliac. (Con- sult the intestinal anastomoses.) (2) The superficial perineal artery is given off at the base of the triangular ligament, perforates the perineal fascia, crosses over or behind the transverse perineal muscle, extends forward between the erector and crus penis and the accelerator urinse muscles, to the base of the scrotum, where it ends in supplying the superficial parts of that structure. It gives off the transverse perineal artery to the muscle of that name, besides supplying the adjacent parts. (3) The artery to the bulb. This is a considerable artery which arises from the internal pudic within the space between the layers of the triangular ligament. Its course

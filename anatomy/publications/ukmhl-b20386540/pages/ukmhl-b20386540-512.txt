510 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Hepatic Artery, Next in size, comes off from the right side of the coeliac axis. It takes a direction to the right and upward to the liver. Branches.—(a) The pyloric. This is given off opposite the pylorus, passes to this end of the stomach, turns to the left and joins the terminal branches of the gastric. (^) The g-astroduodenalis, really one of the branches of bifurcation of the hepatic, descends behind the pylorus. See its fur- ther course below, (c) The cystic. This supplies the gall bladder, (d^ The terminal branches, right and left, to supply their respective lobes of the liver. The relations of the hepatic artery, duct, and portal vein have been given. See Gastrohepatic Omentum^ page 492. (e) The hepatic gives off several small pancreatic branches to that gland. DISSECTION. Divide the anterior layer of the greater omentum just below the greater curvature of the stomach. Turn the stomach up over the chest and fasten it there with chain hooks. Complete the dissection of the splenic and gastro- duodenal arteries. Trace the common bile duct and portal vein as far as possible. Clean the anterior surfaces of the pancreas, duodenum, and the beginning of the superior mesenteric artery. The Splenic Artery. Fig. 105.—This is the largest of the coeliac branches. It passes behind the stomach toward the left to supply the spleen. It gives off {a) numerous small branches to the pancreas as it courses along its upper border, called the pancreaticse parvse. {b) A large artery, the pancreatica magna, to the same gland, (c) Then the left g-astro-epiploic which follows the greater curvature of the stomach between the layers of the great omentum, from left to right to inosculate with the right artery of this name. (d) The vasa brevia, several branches to the fundus of the stomach, which anastomose with the gastric, (e) The ter- minal branches to the spleen itself

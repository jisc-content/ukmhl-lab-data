103 THE NECK, ANTERIOR. The Pneumog-astric Nerve. Figs. lo, ii, 17, 18. This leaves the interior of the skull through the jugular foramen, lying in the central compartment of the same with the ninth and eleventh nerves, passes straight downward behind and between the internal jugular vein and the inter- nal carotid artery, then between the same vein and the common carotid, resting upon the fascia covering the rec- tus capitis anticus major, and longus coUi muscles. At the base of the neck the right nerve crosses over the front of the subclavian artery and lies between it and the innominate vein. On the left side it lies between and behind the subclavian and common carotid arteries. For its course and relations in the chest see page 342. Just below the skull will be found the enlargement of the pneumogastric called the ganglion of the trunk. To this the hypoglossal nerve is firmly united by connective tissue. Branches of the Pneumogastric.â€”The pneumogastric re- ceives branches from the spinal accessory, hypoglossal, superior cervical sympathetic ganglion, and the loop be- tween the two upper cervical nerves. These branches enter the ganglion of the trunk. The pneumogastric gives off minute branches to the glossopharyngeal, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, and two upper cervical nerves. The branches of distribution, in the neck. {a) The pharyngeal: May be one or more ; come origi- nally from the spinal accessory branch of communication. They form, with branches from the sympathetic and glosso- pharyngeal, the pharyngeal plexus, from which branches are given to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx. ib) The superior laryngeal: Arises from the lower part

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 352 left of the middle plane of the body. The oesophagus with the pneumogastric nerves pass through it. Also some small oesophageal arterial filaments. The caval opening is in the right portion of the diaphragm at the posterior border of the central tendon where the right and middle leaflets join. Through it passes the inferior vena cava. Through the crura pass the cord of the sympathetic nerve, the splanchnic nerves, and in addition, on the left side, the azygos minor vein. Having removed the heart and great vessels (viz. : the ascending and transverse aorta and its branches, the pul- monary artery, the superior cava), the trachea and lungs, in one mass, they are to be dissected :â€” (i) The heart, great vessels, coronary arteries, ventricles, and auricles are to be studied as they are seen from the front. (2) The structures and their relations which com- pose the root of the lungs are to be investigated. (3) Sep- arate the heart (and vessels) from the lungs (and trachea). (4) Complete the dissection of the posterior of the heart (ventricles, auricles, and vessels), then open its cavities and learn their parts or contents. (5) Complete the study and comparison of the right and left lung, inflating them for this purpose. (6) Follow up the bronchi to the main sub- divisions, three for the left and two for the right lung. The Right Coronary Artery. Figs. 70, 71. Comes off from the anterior sinus of Valsalva of the aorta, appears between the right auricle and pulmonary artery, follows the auriculoventricular groove to the right border of the heart, here divides into two terminal arteries. One continues the course around in the auriculoventri- cular groove to the back of the heart to anastomose with a

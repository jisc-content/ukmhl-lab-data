101 THE NECK, ANTERIOR. Action.—They flex the neck laterally if acting from below; if from above, they raise and fix the first rib, thus aiding inspiration. Scalenus Posticus. Fig. 76. Origin.—From the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower two or three cervical vertebrae. Insertion.—Into the outer surface of the second rib behind the insertion of the serratus magnus. Nerve Supply.—The three lower cervical nerves. Action.—As slight lateral flexor of the lower cervical vertebrae, also as an accessory muscle of inspiration by raising and fixing the second rib. The Common Carotid Artery. Figs. 18, 71. On the right side the common carotid extends from the bifurcation of the innominate behind the sternoclavicular articulation, upward to the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into the external and internal carotids. On the left side the artery arises as the middle branch from the arch of the aorta. Its course is upward to the same point as on the right side. Relations.—The relations of the thoracic portion of the left common carotid are given on page 340. In the neck they are alike. At the base of the neck the common carotids are about an inch apart, at their termination about two inches apart. The course of the artery is indicated by the anterior bor- der of the sternomastoid (natural landmark), or a line drawn from the sternoclavicular articulation to the front of the mastoid process (artificial). The common carotid, internal jugular, and pneumogas- tric nerve are contained within the same sheath of the deep

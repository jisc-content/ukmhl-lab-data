A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 610 and in flexion to rotate the leg inward (pronation). (2) Upon the thigh, it has the same action as the semitendi- nosus. (3) Upon the body, the muscle acts as the semi- tendinosus. The Great Sciatic Nerve. Figs. 112, 114, 126, 127. This is the largest nerve in the body. It is formed within the pelvis but close to the great sacrosciatic foramen, by the convergence of the lumbosacral cord, the first, second, and third sacral nerves (anterior branches, see page 553). It emerges through the great sacrosciatic foramen being below the pyriformis muscle, and descends into the thigh until at its lower third, when it divides into the external and internal popliteal nerves. In its course the great sciatic nerve lies between the tuberosity of the ischium and the great trochanter, and crosses the gemellus superior, tendon of the obturator internus, gemellus inferior (tendon of the obturator externus), the quadratus femoris, and adductor magnus muscles. It lies under the gluteus maximus, and long head of the biceps muscles, and is covered by the fascia lata, superficial fascia and the integument. In the upper part of its course it is accompanied by the arteria comes nervi ischiadici. Branches,â€”(i) Muscular, to the biceps, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and adductor magnus. (2) Articular, to the hip and knee joints. The latter through the internal and external popliteal branches. The Internal Pudic Nerve. See page 413. The Nerve to the Obturator Internus. This branch of the sacral plexus arises from the second

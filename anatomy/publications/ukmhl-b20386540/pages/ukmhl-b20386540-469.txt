THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 467 duodenum, to which it is connected by a duct, is a mass of budding cells that subsequently forms the liver. The foetal liver, then, is in front of the stomach, between the layers of the anterior mesogaster (future hepatic ligaments and gastrohepatic omentum), by which it is connected to the diaphragm the stomach, and duodenum. Into the last opens the duct of the liver. Behind the stomach another mass of cells springs up from whose growth the spleen is formed ; this also develops between the two layers of the mesogaster. In the same way the pancreas springs from a mass of cells in the mesoduodenum (posterior to the gut). (Diags. 32, 33, 34, c.f.g:) Coincident with the rotation of the small and first parts of the large intestine, the stomach, first part of duodenum, and liver turn over toward the right side of the abdominal cavity (Diag. 3 5), while the spleen is crowded over to left side of the abdomen. In order to understand these new relations and how they come to be formed, we must consider how the peritoneal attachments can be shifted. There is more surface to be covered than there is peri- toneum to cover it. Some parts must be only partially covered by peritoneum in this case ; this is what really oc- curs. In the beginning there is enough peritoneum to cover the primitive gut, but the gut, liver, spleen, etc., growing faster than the peritoneum, some of them become deprived of their peritoneal covering in part. The attach- ments of the peritoneum to the abdominal wall are also shifted by the peritoneum being drawn up in one direction more than in another, until the base of the original attach- ment is completely altered. For instance, the colon rotates to the right side of the abdomen, the right layer of the mesocolon is taken up by the growth of the other abdomi-

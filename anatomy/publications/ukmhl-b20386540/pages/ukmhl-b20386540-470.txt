468 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. nal organs (chiefly the liver), until the colon may be left covered only in front and at the sides (the usual condition), or, less peritoneum being drawn off from the colon, there will be left a distinct mesocolon of varying length. In the same manner the entire attachment of the gut below the stomach is moved to the left. As a part of this process of peritoneal alterations the Formation of the Omentu7n must next be explained. It is formed by the pouching to the left and forward of the mesogaster below the spleen and as far as the duo- denum. This bag will be composed of two layers of the peri- toneum originally forming the mesogaster. It comes to hang down over the intestines covering them in. In a ver- tical section of the foetus from before backward, the dilated bag of mesogaster (omentum) is seen to come off from the lower part of the stomach, and after making the down- ward loop, to return to the back of the abdomen, where it is attached : the transverse mesocolon and the mes- entery are attached separately and in this order below the posterior omental attachment. (Diags. 36, 37.) As growth goes on, the under layer of omentum is drawn away from the spine and then from the upper part of the colon, while the inner layer comes to rest upon the colon and to form the upper layer of its mesocolon. (Diag. 38.) This gives the typical formation seen in the adult vertical anteroposterior sections. If the process is inter- rupted, the foetal condition prevails and the omentum is separate from and above the transverse mesocolon at their posterior attachments. (Diag. 37.) This failure of develop- ment is a predisposing condition to volvulus of the bowel. The omentum passing to the colon and becoming attached

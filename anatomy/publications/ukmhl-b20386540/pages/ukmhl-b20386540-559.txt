THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 557 The Superficial Arteries. Figs. 88, 115. Are the superficial external pudic. The superficial epigastric. See page 436. The superficial circumfiex iliac. See page 572. Superficial twig-s of the muscular branches of the femoral are seen after penetrating the fascia lata along the front of the thigh. The superficial branch of the anastomotica magna will be found on the inner side of the knee with the internal saphenous nerve. The Superficial Veins. Fig. 115. The internal saphenous vein is found at the inner side of the knee as it ascends from the leg. It passes upward to enter the saphenous opening (passing through the cribri- form fascia), and empty into the femoral vein. In its course up the thigh it receives the external and internal cutaneous femoral veins, and at the saphenous opening the superficial external pudic, epigastric, and circumflex iliac veins. The Superficial Nerves. Fig. 115. These will be demonstrated as the fascia lata is cleaned, though filaments of the main branches will be found at this stage. It is not advisable to delay the dissection to look especially for them. They are branches from the last dorsal, between the crest of the ilium and great trochanter; External Cutaneous; the middle and internal cutaneous from the Anterior Crural; the Genitocrural (see page S32) ; and the Ilio-i7tguinal (see page 530). The Femoral Lymphatics. Fig. 115. These will be found below the middle of Poupart's liga- ment and grouped about the saphenous opening. They receive the drainage of the superficial area of the lower

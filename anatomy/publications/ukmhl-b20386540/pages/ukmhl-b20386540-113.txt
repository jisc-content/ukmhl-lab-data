THE NECK, ANTERIOR. 113 The artery crosses the phrenic nerve, scalenus anticus muscle, subclavian artery, and brachial plexus. Its branches in this part of its course are (a) muscular to the sternomastoid and subclavius; (li) nutrient to the clavicle ; {c) the suprasternal; {(T) supra-acromial to these regions ; and (c) the articular to the acromioclavicular and shoulder joints. For the remaining branches, see page 371. The Internal Mammary Artery. Fig. 18. It is given off close to the scalenus anticus muscle from the under surface of the subclavian. It descends directly into the thorax behind the cartilage of the first rib. For its course, relations, branches, and veins, see pages 320. The Superior Intercostal Artery.—Second Portion of the Subclavian. Fig. 74. This branch arises from the back of the subclavian, be- hind the inner border of the scalenus anticus muscle. It takes an arched course backward, upward, and then downward into the chest, passing in front of the neck of the first rib. From the back of the arch it gives off the deep cervical (profunda cervicis) branch, which passes backward between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib to the back of the neck, where it will be found between the complexus and semispinalis colU muscles. Seepage 135. For the costal portion of the superior intercostal, see page 346. The Posterior Scapular.—The Third Portion of the Sub- clavian. Figs. 17, 18. The posterior scapular artery usually arises from this portion of the subclavian. When arising as a branch of the subclavian the posterior scapular takes a course backward 8

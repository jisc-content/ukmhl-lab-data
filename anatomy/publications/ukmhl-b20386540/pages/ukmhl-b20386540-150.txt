Branches of the Superior Maxillary Nerve, (1) Within the skull, one or two recurrent filaments supplying the dura. (2) In the sphenomaxillary fossa. {a) The orbital or temporomalar nerve. Enters the orbit through the sphenomaxillary fissure, and divides into the temporal and malar branch. The temporal branch passes through the temporal foramen in the malar bone, enters the temporal fossa, passes through it to pierce the temporal fascia above the zygoma and be distributed to the integu- ment of the anterior part of the temporal region. The malar branch passes through the malar foramen of the malar bone to supply the integument over that bone, {p) The posterior superior dental nerve divides into two branches, which descend along the posterior surface of the superior maxillary bone, enter the posterior dental foramina, and supply the molar teeth and mucous membrane adjacent to them, (c) The middle superior dental nerve is given off the superior maxillary in the posterior part of the infra- orbital canal, runs downward and forward in a special canal on the outer wall of the antrum to supply the bicuspid teeth, (d^ The anterior superior dental nerve is given off at the anterior part of the infra-orbital canal, and descends in a canal on the anterior wall of the antrum to supply the incisive and the canine teeth and gives off the nasal branch to the mucous membrane of the floor and wall of the anterior part of the inferior meatus. The three dental nerves have loops of communication with each other, thus forming the superior dental plexus. {e) The terminal

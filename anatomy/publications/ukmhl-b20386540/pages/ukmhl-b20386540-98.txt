98 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, Nerve Supply.—The glossopharyngeal. Action.—To raise the pharynx and larynx. The Glossopharyngeal Nerve. Figs. lo, ii, i8. This is found in the dissection of the neck, as it curves for- ward around the outer side of the stylopharyngeus muscle. It leaves the skull through the jugular foramen, in the central compartment, with the tenth and eleventh nerves. It runs forward between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, then winds around the outer border of the stylopharyngeus muscle to terminate in the under surface of the hyoglossus muscle. Branches.—The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies the stylopharyngeus muscle, then gives off small filaments to help form the pharyngeal plexus, and to supply the tonsil and tongue. The Internal Carotid Artery. Figs. i6, 17, 18. This begins at the same point as the external, viz. : at the bifurcation of the common carotid, at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It passes directly upward to the base of the skull, being internal to the external carotid, and separated from it by the structures mentioned on page 93. Relations.—See the relations of the external carotid, page 92. In the beginning of its course the artery lies in the su- perior carotid triangle, and then within the submaxillary triangle. As it passes upward it rests upon the rectus capitis anticus major, the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion, and the pneumogastric nerve. Behind it is the internal jugular vein, which, near the base of the skull, is separated from the artery by the hypoglossal, pneumogas- tric, glossopharyngeal, and spinal accessory nerves.

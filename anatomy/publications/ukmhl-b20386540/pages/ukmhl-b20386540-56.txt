A MANUAL OF AAA TO MY. 56 cavity through the sphenoidal fissure in three divisions, the frontal, lachrymal, and the nasal. The frontal and lachrymal nerves enter above the rectus externus, the nasal between the two heads of that muscle. The frontal and lachrymal branches have already been given above. (Pages 49 and 50.) The Nasal Nerve. Fig. 13. Diag. 4. This nerve runs forward and inward between the rectus superior and the optic nerve to the inner wall of the orbit, where it enters the anterior ethmoidal foramen, passes through it into the cranial cavity, runs forward on the outer border of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, leaves the cranium by traversing the nasal slit at the side of the crista galli, and appears in the nasal fossa, where it termi- nates in three branches. In the orbit the nerve gives off the following branches :â€” Between the two heads of the rectus externus, the long root to the ophthalmic ganglion. A very slender filament about half an inch long. Two long" ciliary filaments to the eye. These run along the inner side of the optic nerve. The infratrochlear nerve is the last branch given off just before the nerve leaves the orbit. It passes forward beneath the pulley for the superior oblique and supplies the integument about the inner part of the eye and upper part of the nose, also the mucous membrane of the inner part of the eye, lachrymal sac, and caruncle. The remaining branches will be given when describing the nasal fossae. The Ophthalmic, or Lenticular Ganglion. Fig. 11. This is a ganglion developed in connection with the oph- thalmic division of the fifth nerve. It is about as large as

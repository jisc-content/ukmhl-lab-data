The parotid gland and masseter muscle are covered by a dense layer of fascia, the parotid and masseteric, a prolongation of the superficial layer of the cervical fascia upward to the zygomatic arch. Be very careful in remov- ing this fascia to leave the branches of the facial nerve, the auriculo-temporal nerve, the transverse facial artery, Stenson's duct, and the detached portion of the parotid gland (glandula socia parotidis) uninjured upon the masseter muscle.

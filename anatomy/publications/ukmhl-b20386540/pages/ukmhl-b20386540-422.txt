It receives the two veins of divisions of the dorsal vein of the penis, the veins of the prostate and bladder, communi- cates with the hemorrhoidal plexus, and empties by a right and left branch into the corresponding internal iliac vein. The Vesical Plexus Is formed by the veins which surround the bladder and at its base empty into the prostatic plexus. In the female, the vaginal plexus surrounds the vagina and opens into the hemorrhoidal and vesical plexuses. The uterine plexus terminates in the ovarian veins. Base of the Bladder. See page 537. The external trig"one (Fig. 84) is the surface of the bladder included between the diverging vasa deferentia and the peri- toneal reflection from the bladder to the rectum, which is from one to one and one-half inches from the base of the prostate.

These are two in number, two inches long, one-half inch wide, one-quarter inch thick, situated outside the vas deferens, one and one-quarter inches above, and, like the vas, inclining downward and inward to the prostatic notch to empty into the common duct. Their function is the storage of the seminal fluid. Relations.â€”Behind is the rectum ; in front, the bladder and termination of the ureters ; internally, the vas deferens ; below, the prostate. They are enclosed in a capsule from the rectovesical fascia. When unraveled each vesicle is found to consist of a single tube about four inches long, with numerous blind outgrowths. Vas Deferens. See page 542. The Prostate. Fig. 84. Diags. 27, 28. This is a fibromuscular gland surrounding the neck of the bladder and the beginning of the urethra. It is heart-

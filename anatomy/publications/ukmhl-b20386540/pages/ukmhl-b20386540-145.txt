145 THE HEAD AND NECK, POSTERIOR, of the soft palate downward and forward, or the tongue upward and backward. The Eustachian Tube. The cartilaginous portion of this tube will be exposed from its anterior part, lying between the levator and tensor palati muscles and giving origin to some fibres of these muscles. The palatopharyngeus also has a small bundle arising from the tube, the salpingopharyjigeits. The opening of the Eustachian tube is in the shape of a vertical slit, and the canal leads into the cavity of the middle ear. DISSECTION. Separate the tongue and larynx from the skull. Remove any remains of the oesophagus. Identify the epiglottis, hyoid bone, thyroid, cricoid, and (upon the top of the cricoid behind) the small arytenoid cartilages. Forward and upward from the arytenoid cartilages pass the aryteno-epiglottic folds to the side of the epiglottis. Between these folds is the upper opening of the larynx. Looking into this opening the canal of the larynx will be seen to be con- stricted at two places by two anteroposterior bands. The upper pair are the false vocal cords and the lower pair the true vocal cords. The slit between the vocal cords is the rima glottidis and varies in width according to the approximation of the vocal cords. The true vocal cords may be made to approach or diverge from each other by depressing or elevating the thyroid upon the cricoid cartilage, or by rotat- ing the arytenoid cartilages upon the cricoid cartilages. The description of the cartilages of the larynx is omitted from this manual as being to the larynx what the bones are to the other parts of the body. External Structures. Muscles. Cricothyroid. Origin.—From the anterior part of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion,—Into the inferior border of the thyroid carti- lage. lO

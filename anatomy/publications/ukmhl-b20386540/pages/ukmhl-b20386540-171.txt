171 THE BRAIN. The interbrain gives origin to the optic thalami, pineal gland, infundibulum, (part of the) pituitary body, the optic nerve (primarily). The cavity within the interbrain remains as the third ventricle. It is joined to the lateral ventricles by the foramina of Monro, which are the remains of the comparatively wide openings in the embryo, that connects the fore and interbrain cavities. The midbrain furnishes the crura cerebri, corpora quad- rigemina, secondary portion of the optic nerve. The narrow canal which runs through it is the aqueduct of Sylvius. The hindbrain forms the cerebellum, valve of Vieussens, pons, and the anterior part of the fourth ventricle. Dias^. 14. Same stage as the preceding diagram.

From it arises the auditory nerve, and it completes the posterior part of the fourth ventricle. To follow the changes a little more in detail that result in producing the above results : The forebrain enlarges rapidly forward, outward, upward, and backward until it

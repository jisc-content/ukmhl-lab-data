234 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. As the optic thalami grow upward they approach each other and become united along their opposing surfaces. This central bond of union later diminishes in extent, but persists as the middle commissure. The fibres of the internal capsule turn downward and backward under the optic thalamus ; thus the latter is said to rest upon the former. The Internal Capsule. Figs. 32, 35, 45, From what has been said it will be apparent that this part of the cerebrum is a mass of white fibres which pass from the cortex and ganglia to the base of the brain, where they appear as two rounded bundles of fibres under the name of the crura cerebri. Fig. 29. From a vertical-transverse section the internal capsule will be seen to pass upward and outward between the optic thalamus on the inside and the lenticular nucleus on the outside, then between the caudate and lenticular nuclei, and then to radiate to the cortex of the brain. This radiation of the fibres of the internal capsule is called the corona radiata, and takes place to all parts of the cortex. Fig. 37. On a horizontal section the internal capsule presents two portions or limbs, an anterior and posterior, united together at an angle of about 113 degrees. The angle is the knee, and is at the gap between the caudate nucleus and the optic thalamus. The anterior limb lies between the caudate and lenticular nuclei, the posterior between the optic thalamus and the lenticular nucleus. As previously stated, the lenticular nucleus has a narrow sheet of white fibres covering its ex- ternal surface ; this is the external capsule. Again external to the external capsule is a plate of gray matter—the claustrum—which is placed vertically, and in

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 390 Beginning above with a pair of curved bone cutters (having a blunt-pointed lower blade), carefully sever all the laminae on both sides from above down- ward, keeping as close to their outer extremities as possible. Remove the laminae, the spinous processes, and connecting ligaments. Clean the posterior surface of the dura. Carefully trace outward the nerve trunks as they pass from the dura to enter the intervertebral foramina. Open the dura carefully from above downward. The Spinal Dura. Figs. 80, 81. This membrane is similar in structure to the cranial dura, with which it is continuous at the foramen magnum. It differs in this point that it does not in the spine form the inner periosteum for the vertebrae as it does for the cranial bones, though it is connected to the periosteum and liga- ments of the former by a loose connective tissue. It extends from the foramen magnum to about the second or third sacral vertebra, beyond which it is prolonged as a cord-like sheath for the filum terminale of the cord, and is attached to the base of the coccyx. The dura is pierced by the spinal nerve, around which it is prolonged in the shape of funnel-like sheaths for a short distance, until it blends with the sheaths of the nerves. The inner surface of the dura is smooth, as in the brain, and is separated in a similar manner from the arachnoid membrane by the subdural space. The spinal dura does not send processes into the fissures of the cord. The Spinal Arachnoid. This reaches as low as the dura, to the inner surface of which it is closely applied (but separated from it by the subdural space, which in the normal condition is very nar- row). It surrounds the nerves within the tubular sheaths of the dura and terminates like that membrane by becom- ing continuous with the sheaths of the nerves.

414 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. (2) The perineal nerve. This lies below the artery (subject standing). It penetrates the perineal fascia close to the base of the triangular ligament, divides into two branches, the posterior or external and the internal or ante- rior. These branches pass through the perineal triangle and terminate in the scrotum (female, the labium majus). From this nerve muscular branches pass to the transversus perinsei, accelerator urinae (sphincter vaginae), erector penis (clitoris), and filaments also pass to the compressor urethrae, bulb, and mucous membrane of the urethra. (3) The dorsal nerve of the penis lies first above the internal pudic artery, continues with the artery into the triangular space, crossing the artery to get below it. It leaves the triangular space with the dorsal artery of the penis, being situated at the outer side of the artery, and terminates in branches to the glans. For the course of the artery see above. The nerve supplies in its course branches to the corpus cavernosum, glans, and integument of penis. In the female the nerve is smaller, but takes a similar course and distribution. DISSECTION. Remove the erector penis, accelerator urinae, and transversus perineae mus- cles. Clean the bulb (corpus spongiosum), crura (corpora cavernosa), and the anterior layer of the triangular ligament. The Corpus Spong-iosum. (Is described here, but see page 440 for dissection of penis.) Fig. 83. This is a cylindrical tube of fascia containing erectile tissue, and traversed through its centre by the urethra. It is placed below and between the two crura, to which it is firmly bound by the sheath of the penis. It is dilated at each end ; the anterior dilatation is called

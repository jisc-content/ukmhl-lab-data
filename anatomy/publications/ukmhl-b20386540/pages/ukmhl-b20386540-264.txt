A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 262 is inclined from above downward and outw^ard. The Left: Is a small oval space half an inch by an inch, its centre an inch and a quarter to the left of the median line behind the second left space and third cartilage. Its long axis is directed from above downward and outward. (8) The auriciiloveutricular groove is indicated by a line from the right to the left heart border, beginning on a level with the upper margin of the fourth right and ending on a level with the lower edge of the third left cartilage. This hne is convex upward and crosses the middle of the ster- num on a level with the lower border of the third cartilages. (9) The aortic area is a little more than an inch wide and two inches in length. It extends from the upper border of the third to behind the middle of the first cartilages. At its beginning and ending its centre is behind the median line, but in the middle of its course the artery is convex toward the right. (10) The Area of the Pulmonary Artery.—About an inch and a quarter wide and an inch and a half long (in the photo- graph). Begins on a level with the lower border of the third, and ends behind the middle of the second left carti- lages. Below, its centre is half an inch, and above, three- quarters of an inch, to the left of the median line. (11) The superior vena cava is represented by a vertical area three-fourths of an inch wide at the right of the aortic area, reaching from the (right auricle) right extremity of the base line upward to the first intercostal space, where the innominate veins coalesce. (12) The outline of the lungs (in inspiration) is indicated by the following lines :— The apices of the lungs reach into the base of the neck a distance of from one and a half to two inches above the first ribs, consequently the lines representing the apices of

395 THE SPINAL CORD. matter is enclosed within the white, and exists in the shape of two large commas " ('), turned with the head anterior, the convex surfaces turned toward each other, and con- nected at their middle by the gray commissure. Here we must pause. The subject of the internal arrange- ment of the cord and brain is most fascinating, but it does not properly enter into the scope of such a manual of anatomy as this. However, the student should not be con- tent to let the matter rest here, but should pass from this hasty and necessarily incomplete description of the brain and cord to the microscopic anatomy of the same, then to their functions, and lastly to the application of all this knowledge to the workings of medical and surgical practice. The Spinal Nerves. Fig. 81. They arise from the side of the cord in 32 pairs by two sets of roots as already indicated, the anterior (motor) and posterior (sensory), the former being smaller than the latter. Inasmuch as the spinal cord does not reach to the lower extremity of the spinal canal, it follows that, as the spinal nerves leave the cord they have to descend in order to leave by their proper foramen, the downward inclination of the nerves increases from above downward, until at the lower end of the cord the canal is filled with the nerves from below the last dorsal vertebra, which run parallel with each other and then slightly outward to reach their foramen of exit; this arrangement produces a tasseled appearance named the cauda equina. The point at which the spinal nerves leave the side of the cord and their points of emergence are given in the following table copied from Gowers :â€”

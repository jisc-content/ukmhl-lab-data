165 THE BRAIN, The Cerebral Veins. These are grouped into cortical, basilar, and ganglionic (deep or central). The superior cortical veins gather the blood from the outer and inner surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres and ter- minate in the superior longitudinal sinus. They are eight to ten in number, and open into the sinus forward, contrary to the direction of the blood stream, which is backward. The basilar or inferior cortical veins collect the blood from the lower and under surface of the cerebrum and empty into the cavernous, superior petrosal, and lateral sinuses. The more important of these are the {a) middle cerebral vein, which accompanies the middle cerebral artery and empties into the cavernous sinus. (U) The great anastomotic vein of Trolard (which extends from the parietal lobe to open into the superior petrosal sinus. It communicates above with the superior cerebral veins and thus forms a communication between the superior longitu- dinal sinus and those at the base of the skull), and {c) the posterior anastomosing* vein of Labbe (which passes from the middle cerebral vein to the lateral sinus over the outer part of the temporal lobe). The central, gang-lionic, deep cerebral veins empty into the veins of Galen, which will appear when dissecting the interior of the brain. DISSECTION. The pia and its numerous vessels are to be removed from the brain. This must be undertaken very slowly. It is best to begin the removal from the cortical surface, then from the inner surface, and finally from the base. Dur- ing this dissection it is well to place the brain in a basin of water, which partially floats it and preserves its contour. When working upon the inner surface of a hemisphere do not separate them too widely, or the corpus callosum will be torn through. Do not draw the vessels directly upward, but at right angles to the surface.

20 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The junction of the vertical with the external surface of a hemisphere is indicated by a line drawn from the nasion over the top of the head to a point half an inch external to the inion. This line when drawn on both sides will indicate the position of the superior longitudinal sinus. The line of junction of the inferior and external surfaces of the cerebrum is indicated as follows : Start the line at the nasofrontal groove, and carry it out- ward to a point five-eighths of an inch (one-half to three- fourths of an inch) above the E. A. P. ; from here pass backward to the Sylvian point, then curve a line downward and forward (with its concavity backward to correspond to the rounded extremity of the temporal lobe) to a point just above the junction of the zygoma with the frontal process of the malar bone. (This last point is situated one-fourth of an inch above the zygoma and the same distance from the posterior border of the frontal process of the malar bone. Or, if measured from the E. A. P., it is a vertical line dropped downward from a point five-eighths of an inch posterior to the E. A. P. to terminate one-fourth of an inch from the zygoma.) Now continue the line backward and slightly downward until the junction of the zygomatic arch with the skull is reached (just over the condyle of the inferior maxilla). The line then inclines upward and back- ward to reach a point one inch behind and half an inch above the level of the external auditory meatus. (This portion of the hne passes from one-eighth to three-eighths of an inch above the upper margin of the external meatus and intersects a vertical line drawn upward from the pos- terior border of the root of the mastoid process, one inch behind and half an inch above the external auditory meatus.) The lower posterior border of the cerebrum is finished

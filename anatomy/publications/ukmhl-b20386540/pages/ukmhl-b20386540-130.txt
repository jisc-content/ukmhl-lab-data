The remaining branches of the posterior divisions of the occipital nerves are small The internal branches supply the integument of the back of the neck near the middle hne. The external branches are distributed to the muscles of this region. The Occipital Artery. Figs. 76 and 77. It is found at this stage of the dissection as it emerges from under the inner border of the splenius capitis muscle, between the sternomastoid and trapezius muscles close to the occipital bone. Its course is upward over the back of the head, breaking up into branches as it goes, to finally anastomose with the posterior temporal, posterior auricular, and the opposite occipital. Its deeper course, from where its dissection stopped (page 95) as it lay between the rectus capitis lateralis and posterior belly of the digastric, is backward between those muscles to the occipital groove on the mastoid process of the temporal bone, then along the insertion of the superior oblique muscle and complexus, being covered by the sternomastoid, splenius capitis, trachelomastoid, and pos- terior belly of the digastric in this part of its course. The artery gives off numerous small branches to the muscles, and one of considerable size, the princeps cervicis^ which courses downward beneath the splenius and com- plexus muscles to form an anastomosis with the profunda cervicis. See latter, page 135. The preceding is usually called the deep branch of the princeps cervicis. A small branch of the princeps cervicis perforates the splenius and forms an anastomosis with the superficial cervical branch of the transverse cervical. See page 112.

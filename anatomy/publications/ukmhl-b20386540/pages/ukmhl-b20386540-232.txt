A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 230 mens (and in the original photographs) shows the lenticu- lar nucleus to consist of three portions vertically divided by thin striations of white fibres (the external and internal medullary laminae). The two inner portions of the nucleus are lighter in color than the outer portion ; the former con- stitute the globus pallidus, the latter the putamen. The Optic Thalami. Figs. 30, 33, 39, 40, 46, 51, 53, 54. These are double structures, which form the lateral walls for the third ventricle and lie internal and posterior to the corpora striata. An optic thalamus is somewhat oval in shape with the long axis directed anteroposteriorly. It is slightly contracted in front and below, and expanded behind and above. The narrower anterior extremity is the anterior tubercle, which forms the posterior boundary for the foramen of Monro ; the prominent posterior part is the posterior tubercle, or the pulvinar. The pulvinar terminates externally in a sHght oval elevation, which is the external geniculate body. The superior surface of the optic thalamus forms a part of the floor of the lateral ventricle, and furnishes support for the posterior pillar of the fornix and the choroid plexus. The course of the latter is indicated on the thala- mus by a shallow groove, sulcus choroideus, which divides the upper surface into two portions, the external being within the lateral ventricle and the internal covered by the velum interpositum. The internal surface forms a nearly vertical wall and limits the third ventricle laterally. It is divided from the superior surface by the peduncle of the pineal gland which runs forward from the gland to join the anterior pillars of the fornix. At the posterior internal part of the superior surface of the thalamus, in the angle between the peduncle of the

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 362 of the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves at the side, and the dorsal branches from the same source along the spine. The arteries are minute branches from the intercostals and the other vessels which will appear later. The Deep Fascia. This is a well-marked layer of dense connective tissue which covers in all the structures of the back. Above, it is attached to the base of the occipital bone along the supe- rior curved line, and to the mastoid process of the temporal bone; laterally, in the neck, it becomes the outer layer of the deep cervical fascia, and is attached to the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae ; in the middle line it is attached to the spinous process of all the vertebrae from the skull to the coccyx, in the neck forming the ligamentum nuchae ; back of the shoulder it is attached to the spine and acromion process of the scapula, and becomes continu- ous with the fascia covering the deltoid ; lower down it covers in the latissimus dorsi muscle, and at its anterior border becomes continuous with the axillary fascia (see page 268) ; below it is attached to the crest of the ilium, and above the bone reaches around the body, covering in the external oblique muscle. DISSECTION. Remove the deep fascia, exposing the first layer of muscles. The Trapezius. Fig. 77. Origin.â€”From the inner third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone and occipital protuberance, from all the spines of the cervical vertebrae by means of the liga- mentum nuchae, from the spines of all the dorsal vertebrae and the supraspinous ligament.

88 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. Divide the mylohyoid along the median raphe and at its insertion into the hyoid bone, and reflect the several parts of the muscles. The Hypoglossal Nerve. Figs. lo, i6, 17, 18. The hypoglossal nerve leaves the skull through the ante- rior condyloid foramen, winds outward around the ganglion of the trunk of the pneumogastric nerve from behind forward, passes between the internal jugular vein and the internal caro- tid artery, appears at the lower border of the digastric, turns forward around the occipital artery and across the internal and external carotids, and extends into the muscles of the tongue (resting upon the hyoglossus and under the mylohyoid), where it breaks up into its terminal branches. For the part that the nerve takes in forming the lingual triangle, see page 85. As the hypoglossal nerve crosses the ganglion of the pneumogastric, it receives filaments from that nerve, the sympathetic, and a branch from the first and second cervi- cal nerves. See Cervical Plexus, page 89. Branches.â€”The descendens hypoglossi. This is com- posed of the fibres derived from the cervical plexus (first and second). It leaves the hypoglossal nerve as it is turn- ing around the occipital artery (may come off much higher) and runs forward and downward upon the sheath of the carotid, where it is joined (in the middle of the neck) by the communicantes hypoglossi, forming the ansa hypoglossi (hypoglossal loop). The descendens hypoglossi gives off a small branch to the anterior belly of the omohyoid muscle before the for- mation of the loop. From the loop branches are supplied to the posterior belly of the omohyoid, the sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles. The hypoglossal also gives off a small branch just below

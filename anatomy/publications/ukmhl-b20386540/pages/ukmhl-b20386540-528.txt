A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY, 526 Poupart's ligament, is seen a dimple that is usually occu- pied by a small lymphatic gland. This dimple or small fossa is due to a slight depression in the transversalis fascia, as it pouches into a small gap that is left between the vein and Gimbernat's ligament. The gap (as seen after dissec- tion or after being made by a hernia) is the femoral ring, and the transversalis fascia that covers it over is the septum crurale. A femoral hernia bulges the septum crurale before it in its descent to leave the abdominal cavity by the fem- oral opening. As the dissection progresses the femoral opening will be seen to have these boundaries : To the in- side, Gimbernat's ligament, conjoined tendon, and triangu- lar ligament; in front, Poupart's ligament; to the outside, the external iliac vein covered by the sheath (formed by the union of the iliac fascia beneath, with the transversalis fascia above) ; behind, the pubic portion of the fascia lata covering the pectineus muscle and the horizontal ramus of the pubic bone. The description of the canal will be given later. DISSECTION. Ligate the vena cava at its beginning, divide and remove it, with all the veins emptying into it. Carefully remove the iliopsoas and anterior layer of the lumbar fasciae. Dissect out the receptaculum chyli, splanchnic nerves, sympathetic cord and ganglia, the beginning of the lumbar arteries, the branches of the lumbar plexus external to the psoas muscle, the psoas and iliacus muscles. Follow the vas deferens to the bladder, or the round ligament to the uterus. Trace the ureters to the bladder. ThÂ© Lumbar Sympathetic Ganglia and Cord. Figs. 74, 106, 107, 113. Consist of four ganglia connected together by the sym- pathetic cord, which above comes from the thorax, and below passes to the sacral ganglia. These ganglia lie in

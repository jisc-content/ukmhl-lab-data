The Inferior Maxillary Nerve. Figs, ii, I2. This is the third or lowest branch of the fifth cranial nerve. It issues from the skull through the foramen ovale. It is composed of the entire motor portion of the fifth and a part of the sensory fibres, which unite, after travers- ing the foramen ovale, to form a single trunk that at once divides into a smaller anterior and a larger posterior division. The anterior branch is mostly motor, and the posterior sensory. From the trunk before its division a filament, the recur- rent nerve, passes into the skull through the foramen spinosum with the middle meningeal artery; and a muscu- lar branch to the internal pterygoid, which enters the deep surface of the muscle. Branches of the Anterior Division. (i) The deep temporal nerves. Usually two in number, anterior and posterior, enter the deep surface of the tem- poral muscle. (2) The masseteric. Passes through the sigmoid notch with the masseteric branch of the internal maxillary artery and terminates in the masseter muscle. (3) The external pterygoid nerve to that muscle. (4) The buccal nerve comes forward between the two heads of the external pterygoid muscle, appears in the face issu- ing from under the anterior border of the ramus of the jaw and lying upon the buccinator muscle. The nerve is distributed to the skin and mucous membrane of the cheek. Branches of the Posterior Division. (1) The auriculo-temporal nerve. See page 26. (2) The inferior dental nerve. This is the largest branch

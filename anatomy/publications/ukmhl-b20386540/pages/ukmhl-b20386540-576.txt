A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 574 varying in number, to the muscles in relation to the femoral artery in its course. The Femoral Vein. The femoral vein begins at the opening in the adductor magnus, where it is the continuation of the popliteal vein, and ends under Pouparf s ligament, beyond which point the venous trunk is continued as the external iliac vein. The relations of the femoral vein have been sufficiently given with those of the artery, q. v., page 570. The Tributaries.â€”(i) The venae comites of the anasto- motica magna artery. (2) The venae comites of the mus- cular branches. (3) The deep femoral vein. The deep femoral vein retraces the course of the profunda artery, receiving as it does so the venae comites corresponding to the branches of the profunda femoris artery, and finally empties into the femoral vein about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. In its course the vein lies at the inside and in front of the profunda artery. (4) The long or in- ternal saphenous vein. This large subcutaneous vein emp- ties into the femoral opposite the saphenous opening. See page 557. The femoral vein contains several valves. The anterior crural nerve. See Lumbar Plexus^ page 532. DISSECTION. Divide the iliotibial band just below the tensor muscle and turn the latter upward; at the same time look for its nerve supply. Divide the sartorius, gracilis, and rectus at their middle and reflect their ends, saving their nerves. Incise the fascia stretching across the front of Hunter's canal, and expose the femoral artery, vein, and internal saphenous nerve. Divide the adductor longus at its middle and lower thirds (below where the nerve enters it). Draw the pectineus upward, dividing it through the middle if necessary. Cut through the iliacus under Poupart's ligament and turn the lower part downward. Divide the femoral artery below the origin of the profunda.

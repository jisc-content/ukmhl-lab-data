A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 224 reum, infundibulum (and pituitary gland), the corpora albi- cantia, and the posterior perforated space. The third ven- tricle communicates by means of the foramina of Monro with the lateral ventricles anteriorly, and through the aqueduct of Sylvius with the fourth ventricle posteriorly. The opening into the infundibulum is only a blind one. The Pineal Gland. Figs. 33, 39, 46, 47Â» 54- This is a small gland located between the posterior ex- tremities of the optic thalami and resting upon the groove between the anterior pair of the quadrigeminal bodies. It is about as large as a small pea, and is connected to the rest of the brain by a divided stalk, the lower fibres of which connect it with the posterior commissure, the upper fibres, under the name of the peduncles of the pineal gland, running forward along the optic thalami, marking the junction of the superior and internal surfaces, to cross the depression at the floor of the foramen of Monro and join the anterior pillars of the fornix. The Corpora Quadrigemina. Figs. 33, 38, 39, 40, 47, 48, 53, 54. These consist of four rounded elevations arranged in pairs, situated on either side of the middle line, between the optic thalami and the cerebellum, and upon the quad- rigeminal lamina which forms the roof of the aqueduct of Sylvius. These pairs are separated from each other by vertical and horizontal intersecting grooves, forming a crucial sulcus. The anterior or superior pair of elevations is called the nates, the posterior pair the testes. The quadrigeminal bodies have a narrowing prolongation forward which is called their brachia, or arms. Between these brachia and close to the groove under the pulvinar of the optic thalamus is the internal geniculate body, which

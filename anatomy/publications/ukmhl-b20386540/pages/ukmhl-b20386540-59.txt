THE HEAD, ANTERIOR. 59 The fasciae and platysma and its facial portion, the risorius, are all to be studied and then removed, and the facial muscles above then below the mouth are to be cleaned. Along with the dissection of the muscles will proceed the cleaning of the nerves, veins (facial especially), and the arteries. Risorius. This is a thin sheet of loosely joined muscular fibres, an extension and derivation of the platysma, which extends from the masseteric and parotid fasciae to the angle of the mouth. The Masseteric and Parotid Fasciae. The upward continuation of the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia from the neck over the masseter muscle and parotid gland is called the masseteric and parotid fascia respectively. See page 138. The former is attached, above, to the lower border of the zygomatic arch, and below, to the lower and posterior bor- ders of the lower jaw. An extension of this fascia from the angle of the jaw to the styloid process is called the stylo- maxillary ligament. It serves to separate the parotid from the submaxillary gland. The latter (parotid) fascia covers in the parotid gland. In front it is continuous with the masseteric fascia; above, attached to the zygomatic arch ; behind, to the front of the mastoid process, and below, extends into the cervical fascia. Zyg'omaticus Major. Fig. 3. Origin.—From the outer surface of the malar bone. Insertion.—Into the orbicularis oris, levator anguli oris, and skin at the angle of the mouth. Nerve Supply.—The seventh or facial by its infra-orbital branch. Action.—To raise and retract the angle of the mouth. ZygomaticTis Minor. Origin.—The lower part of the anterior surface of the malar bone.

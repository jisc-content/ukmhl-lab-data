A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY, 436 Superficial Fascia. Fig. 88. This consists of two layers, the external or the subcuta- neous, the internal, deep, or fascia of Scarpa. (i) The external layer is composed of connective and adipose tissue, the varying quantities of the latter determin- ing the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue. Above it is continuous with the superficial fascia of the thorax, and below with that of the thigh. In this layer lie the subcutaneous vessels and nerves. The more important of the vessels are {a) The super- ficial (superior) external pudic, which forms with the artery of the other side an anastomotic arch over the pubes, and at the side of the root of the penis gives off the superficial dorsal artery to that organ, {fi) The stper- ficial epigastric. This passes upward toward the umbilicus, having crossed the middle of Poupart's ligament. These arteries are branches from the femoral; for their origin, see Dissection of Thigh. They are usually divided in operations upon the inguinal lymphatics and herniot- omies. (<f) Numerous cutaneous arterioles from the inter- costals, lumbars, deep epigastrics, and superficial circumflex iliacs. The veins take the names of, and accompany, the arteries. The cutaneous nerves are unimportant, and need not de- tain the student for their dissection. They come from the lower intercostals and the first lumbar nerves. The Lymphatics. Fig. 88. The only lymphatic glands of any importance are those grouped around the superficial epigastric artery, over and above the middle of Poupart's ligament. They drain the superficial region of the lower zone of the abdomen, the

440 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. turn to the perineum, and the gap left over the cord, explains how extravasated urine may find its way from the perineum into the scrotum, and even to the lower abdomi- nal region. The Penis. Figs. 88 to 93. Is divided into the root or base, at the symphysis ; the glans or head ; the neck, just back of the glans ; and the body, between the neck and root. The penis is slung from the symphysis pubis by the suspensory lig*ament, formed from the deep layer of the superficial fascia (Scarpa's), of the abdomen. See above. The integument covering the glans is called the pre- puce or the foreskin. The angle of the penis is the bend which the flaccid organ makes at the symphysis pubis. The Superficial Vessels and Nerves of the Penis.â€” The arteries are derived from the superficial external pudic, the nerves from the terminal branch of the iliohypogastric. The veins are venae comites of the arteries. The Sheaths of the Penis are described in connection with the Corpus Spongiosum on page 414. DISSECTION. Incise the superficial fascia transversely at the level of the umbilicus and vertically in the middle line. Reflect the several portions, leaving the lower segment fastened by its lower attachments. Notice, [a) the iliohypogastric nerve, which appears through the aponeurosis of the external oblique above the spine of the pubes and passes to the dorsum of the penis. (Superficial dorsal nerve of the penis.) [b) The gap in the superficial fascia over the sper- matic cord, {c) The formation of the suspensory ligament of the penis. In- cise the dartos sheath along the dorsum of the penis, reflect it laterally. It will be found continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen and dartos of the scrotum.

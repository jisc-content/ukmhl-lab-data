210 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, These fibres are grouped in four bundles, one beneath each gyrus fornicatus—tcenice tectce—and one on either side of the median line—the strice longitudinales ; between the latter a thin groove is left called the raphe. The longitudinal fibres start from the base of the brain, at the beginning of the fissure of Sylvius, and pass forward to the corpus callosum (as its peduncles), over which they continue to the forceps major. The taeniae tectae are stray fibres belonging to the gyrus fornicatus. The Lateral Ventricles. Figs. 30, 31, 32, 35, 41 to 49 inclusive. These are the irregular cavities which are contained with- in the cerebral hemispheres. Each lateral ventricle communicates with the third ven- tricle and with each other through the foramina of Mon- ro. A lateral ventricle presents, in horizontal section, a central portion, an anterior, a posterior, and a middle pro- longation or horn. The miiejdor horn curves forward, downward, and outward, the posterior horn curves back- ward and inward, and the 7niddle horn takes a course backward, outward, downward, forward, and inward (the descending horn). All these prolongations open into the body of the ven- tricle, which is that portion of the ventricle extending from the foramen of Monro to the beginning of the descending and posterior horns, and corresponds to the intraventricular portion of the optic thalamus. The Boundaries of the Ventricle.—The anterior horn, body, and posterior horn are roofed over by the arched corpus callosum as previously described. The internal wall of the anterior horn is formed by the septum lucidum ; of

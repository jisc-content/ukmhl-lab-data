A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 484 Summary of the Development of the Viscera and Peri- toneum. (1) The alimentary canal is first undifferentiated and a straight tube. (2) It is attached to the backbone by a thin membrane â€”the primitive peritoneum. Also for its upper portion to the anterior abdominal wall. Diag. 32. (3) As development proceeds the various parts of the alimentary canal appear, as stomach, duodenum, small in- testine, large intestine (colon, omega loop, rectum). (4) The peritoneum attached to these various parts of the intestinal canal receives special names according to the part to which it is attached, as mesogaster, mesoduodenum, mesentery, mesocolon, sigmoid mesentery, mesorectum. (5) As the alimentary canal grows it becomes thrown into loops, the greatest lengthening taking place in the part known as the small intestine. Diag. 33. (6) The primitive relations are destroyed by the large intestine crossing over to the right side of the abdominal cavity in front of the small intestine (duodenum), this brings the small intestines to the left side of the abdominal cavity. (7) This also brings out new attachments for the mesen- tery of the large intestine (colon, ascending and transverse). (8) The lower (pyloric) end of the stomach and the liver share in the change about, by falling over to the right side of the abdominal cavity, while the spleen and the upper (cardiac) end of the stomach turn to the left. Similarly, the head of the pancreas turns to the right, while its tail points to the left. Diags. 34, 35. (9) The liver is developed between the folds of the an- terior mesogaster, passing from the anterior border of the stomach to the diaphragm. It is connected with the

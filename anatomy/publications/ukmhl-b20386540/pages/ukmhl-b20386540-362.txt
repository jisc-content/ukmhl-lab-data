A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 360 The left: In front, phrenic nerve and anterior pulmonary plexus ; above, the arch of the aorta ; below, same as right; behind, descending aorta, pneumogastric nerve, and poste- rior pulmonary plexus. UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, Posterior. DISSECTION. Incisions.—(l) From the base of the skull (made by the one on the head and neck) in the median line along the back of the thorax (made by the one •on the upper extremity), to terminate at the tip of the coccyx (extended by the one dissecting the lower extremity). (2) From the median incision out along the spine of the scapula (same for head and neck, page 128) to meet the similar incision in front over the point of the shoulder. (3) Carry a transverse cut from tv^elfth dorsal spine around the body to meet the similar one from the front. This incision answers for both upper and lower extremities. Reflect the integument from the back of the neck, thorax, and trunk; from the arm to below the elbow. To expose the last no farther incisions in the skin are necessary; simply reflect it, beginning at the point where its anterior dissection stopped, and working from the outer to the inner side of the limb. This method will also hold for the removal of the integument from the back of the forearm, hand, and fingers. The Superficial Fascia. The superficial fascia covering the back of the body from the base of the skull to the end of the spine is a dense, brawny layer composed of connective and granular fatty tissue. In the subject it is often found infiltrated by gravi- tated fluid. The superficial fascia is continuous with the similar layer of other adjacent parts of the body. It should be removed in the same manner as the integument. In its removal an outlook should be kept for the superficial nerves and vessels. The cutaneous nerves are the posterior divisions

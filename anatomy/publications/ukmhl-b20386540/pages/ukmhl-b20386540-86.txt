86 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. by the platysma and deep cervical fascia which forms its capsule. Behind are the posterior belly of the digastric, the stylohyoid muscles, and the stylomaxillary ligament; in front, the anterior belly of the digastric ; below, the tendon of the digastric, and the hyoid bone. Internally the gland lies upon the mylohyoid, hyoglos- sus, and styloglossus muscles. The mylohyoid separates the submaxillary from the sublingual gland. Around the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle a deep portion of the submaxillary gland extends forward, and from this deep portion the duct (Wharton's) passes forward and in- ward to open in the floor of the mouth at the summit of a small papilla at the side of the fraenum of the tongue. The duct is about two inches long. Fig. i8. Relations about the Submaxillary Gland.â€”The facial vein and inframaxillary branch of the facial nerve cross the outer surface of the gland. The facial artery deeply grooves the posterior and upper portion of the gland. The submental branch of the facial artery and the mylo- hyoid nerve run together along its upper border. Wharton's duct lies above the lingual nerve (which ac- companies it to the tongue). Between the lingual nerve and gland lies the submaxil- lary ganglion. The arterial supply is from the facial (submaxillary branches) and lingual. The nerves are derived from the submaxillary ganglion, mylohyoid, and sympathetic. For the submaxillary ganglion, see page 119. DISSECTION. Divide the tendon of the digastric on either side of the loop which binds it to the hyoid bone, and the stylohyoid at its insertion.

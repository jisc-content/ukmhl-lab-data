138 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The fascia is described in several layers. (1) The first layer of the cervical fascia. This starts behind from the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae (through the ligamentum nuchae), encloses the trapezius, receives a membranous expansion from the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae at the side of the neck, passes forward to the posterior border of the sternomastoid muscle, spHts into two layers which enclose the muscle and unite at its anterior margin, passes onward and becomes continuous at the middle line with the similar layer from the other side. Above, this first layer is attached to the lower border of the jaw (from its angle being continued to the styloid pro- cess of the temporal bone forming the stylomaxillary liga- ment), and passing over the masseter muscle and parotid gland as the masseteric and parotid fascias, is attached to the lower border of the zygoma. Behind the ear this layer is attached to the superior curved line of the occipital bone and the mastoid process of the temporal bone (externally and internally). Below, to the front of the clavicle, outer margin of the acromion process, and the middle portion of the spine of the scapula. In the middle line the first layer is also fastened to the hyoid bone. (2) The second layer. This.is given off from the inner surface of the first layer along the posterior border of the sternomastoid muscle. It passes forward, enclosing the omohyoid, sternohyoid, and sternothyroid muscles, and unites in the median line with a similar layer from the other side, also with the first layer. Above, it reaches to the hyoid bone. Below, it is at- tached to the inner margin of the manubrium and clavicle.

A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 438 upper part of the thigh, the perineum, the scrotum, the anterior two-thirds of the urethra and superficial parts of the penis (external genitals in the female). The connection of the inguinal lymphatics with the genitals of the male and female explains why they be- come enlarged in inflammatory conditions of those parts. Such enlargement following venereal disease is termed a bubo. The removal of the inguinal glands is a simple operation on the cadaver, but in the living, if they are matted together by inflammatory exudations, it may become quite an under- taking. (2) The deep layer of the superficial fascia. Fascia of Scarpa. Fig. 90. This is a thin layer of tissue in the upper part of the abdomen, where it passes into the deep fascia of the thorax ; below the umbilicus it forms a dense plane that backs the external layer, and is separated from the muscle beneath by a little areolar tissue. It is attached in the middle line along the linea alba, below to the external part of the crest of the ilium, the deep fascia of the thigh close to Poupart's ligament until the spermatic cord is reached, over which it is reflected, then to the front of the pubes and symphysis. Over the cord and from the front of the symphysis, the two layers of the superficial fascia become firmly united, lose the adipose tissue, acquire elastic and muscular fibres, and thus altered in structure pass over the penis and into the scrotum as the dartos sheath, then into the perineum to become continuous with the superficial perineal or Colles' fascia. See page 404. The band of fibres from the lower part of the linea alba and the front of the symphysis which passes on to the penis, forms the suspensory lig-ament for that organ. The extension of the fascia through the scro-

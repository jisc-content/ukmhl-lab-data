501 THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. one-half inches. As it is at this point that the pain is usually greatest in appendicitis, it is a good point to keep in mind. As it was first mentioned by McBurney it takes the name of that surgeon and is called McBurney's point. From the caecum to the liver the large intestine is called the ascending' colon. Here taking a sudden bend to the left the bowel becomes the transverse colon, and the bend is the hepatic flexure. On the left side of the body, under the spleen, the gut turns downward to form the descending* colon while the bend is called the splenic flexure. The continuation of the large intestine is the omega loop and rectum. The ascending colon (Figs. 96, 97, 98, loi, 102) is usually only enveloped by peritoneum in front and at the sides, the posterior part of the bowel resting against the back of the abdomen. It may, however, be completely covered by peritoneum, in which case it is provided with a distinct mesentery. Relations.—In front and at the right is the abdominal wall, at the left the coils of small intestine, below the caecum, and behind the quadratus lumborum, and lower portion of the right kidney. The hepatic flexure lies up under the overhanging edge of the liver, in close contact with the gall bladder. From its outer border, there is often a continuation of the transverse mesocolon to the side of the abdomen ; upon this little shelf the right extremity of the liver rests (sustentaculum hepatis). The transverse colon (Figs. 96, 97, 98, 101) crosses the abdomen from right to left, and from the hepatic to the splenic flexure. It rises higher at its two extremities than in the middle, where it crosses the middle line just above the umbiHcus. Relations.—Above, gall bladder, liver, stomach. Behind,

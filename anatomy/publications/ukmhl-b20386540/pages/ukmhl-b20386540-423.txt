THE PERINEUM, MALE. 421 shaped, one and one-half inches across the base and one and one-quarter inches in vertical extent, placed with its base uppermost and the apex below. There is a notch at the base dividing the gland into two lobes. Into this notch the vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles converge to unite into the common ejaculatory ducts which traverse the prostate downward and forward to open into the floor of the prostatic urethra. The gland is enclosed in a capsule derived from the rectovesical fascia, upon which it rests. At the apex of the gland, at the place where the urethra issues, the fibres of the levator ani muscle are wanting (the muscle being behind the gland), and at this point the recto- vesical fascia becomes continuous with the deep layer of the triangular ligament. Relations.â€”Above : The bladder, vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles. Behind : Rectum separated only by a thin layer of rectovesical fascia. Below : The rectovesical fascia and deep layer of the triangular ligament. In front: Pubo- prostatic ligaments. Laterally : Capsule derived from the rectovesical fascia, and separating it from the levator ani muscle. The prostatic venous plexus encloses the gland, being between it and its capsule. Into the front of the plexus the deep vein of the penis empties. The Lower Portion of the Rectum. For the upper part, see page 504. Fig. 84. Diag. 28. The lower portion of the rectum extends from the tip of the coccyx to the anus, a distance of one and one-half inches. This part of the rectum curves downward and backward ; consequently, in introducing a tube into the rec- tum it should first be pointed forward and upward or toward the umbilicus, then it may be carried backward toward the sacrum. In children this precaution should be followed.

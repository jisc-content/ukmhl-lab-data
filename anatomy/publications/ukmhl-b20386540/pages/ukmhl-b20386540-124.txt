A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 124 Pteryg-oideus Internus. Fig. 12. Origin.—From the pterygoid fossa, tuberosities of the superior maxillary, and palate bones. Insertion.—Into the inner surface of the ramus and angle of the lower jaw below the inferior dental foramen. Nerve Supply.—The inferior maxillary. Actioji.—To close the jaw, to draw it forward, to assist in the grinding movements. DISSECTION. Clean the constrictor muscles, and remove the prevertebral fascia from the muscles it covers. The Pharynx. This is a fibromuscular cavity situated at the base of the skull, behind the nasal (above) and buccal (below) cavities and larynx, and in front of the spinal column. Its length is four and one-half inches from the base of the skull to the level of the cricoid cartilage opposite the fifth cervical vertebra. Its cavity is flattened from before backward, and at its lower portion becomes obliterated by the contact of its anterior and posterior walls (except dur- ing swallowing). Into it open the posterior nares (2), the Eustachian tubes (2), the mouth (i), the larynx (i), and the oesophagus (i), (total 7). The soft palate projects into it from the front and divides its cavity into the nasal (above) and the buccal (below) portions. Its walls are composed of mucous membrane, fibrous tissue (pharyngeal aponeurosis), and muscles (the three constrictors, stylopharyngeus, and palatopharyngeus.) The pharynx is attached above, to the base of the skull (base of sphenoid, petrous portion of temporal and Eus- tachian tube, and internal pterygoid plate) ; in front, to the

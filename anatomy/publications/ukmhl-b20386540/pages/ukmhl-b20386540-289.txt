UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 287 Brandies of the Brachial. (1) The superior profunda. This is the largest branch of the brachial. It arises from the posterior surface of the artery, takes a course downward ; then with the musculo- spiral nerve, downward and outward through the musculo- spiral groove to terminate by anastomosing with the radial recurrent at the outer side of the arm in the space between the brachialis anticus and the supinator longus. Besides the muscular branches it gives off the ascending and articu- lar, which will be found in the dissection of the posterior of the arm. (2) The inferior profunda is given off the inside of the brachial opposite the insertion of the coracobrachialis. It often arises with the superior profunda as a common trunk from the brachial. It takes a course downward and inward with the ulnar nerve to get behind the internal con- dyle and terminates in an anastomosis with the posterior ulnar recurrent and anastomotica magna arteries. (3) The nutrient. This small branch is given off at the lower part of the insertion of the coracobrachialis and enters the nutrient foramen of the humerus. (4) Muscular branches are supplied to the adjacent mus- cles and vary from six to eight in number. (5) The anastomotica magna. This is from the inside of the brachial from one to two inches above the bend of the elbow. Its course is inward, and at the inner border of the arm it divides into two branches: (cd^ the anterior which is smaller than the posterior, and descends between the brachialis anticus and pronator radii teres to anastomose at the inside of the elbow with the anterior recurrent ulnar ; (b) the posterior, which continues backward around the inner side of the arm, anastomoses with the inferior pro- funda and posterior recurrent ulnar arteries, and terminates

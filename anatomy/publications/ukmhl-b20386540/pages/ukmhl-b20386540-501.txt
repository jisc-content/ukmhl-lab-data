THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 499 The Small Intestine. Figs. 96 to 100. The first two-fifths of the intestine below the duodenum is called the jejunum, the remaining three-fifths, the ileum. The coils of the small intestine fill in the space left by the arching colon at the sides and above, and the pelvic viscera below. They are attached to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesentery, a double layer of peritoneum, which reaches from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa, a distance of four to six inches. The mesentery is about eight or nine inches in width, and in length along its intestinal border equals the jejunum and ileum. Between the layers of the mesentery the superior mesenteric artery ramifies. Sometimes a remnant of the vitello-intestinal duct is found on the outer border of the ileum at a distance of from one to three feet from the ileo- caecal valve ; if present it is called Meckel's diverticulum. When existing it may be a menace to the individual on ac- count of forming adhesions with some other part of the abdomen, thus forming a band or bridge over or under which a portion of the intestine might become constricted. In the normal subject it will be seen that the mesentery is just short enough to keep the margin of the intestine from engaging in the abdominal rings or femoral opening, con- sequently in hernia the mesentery must be abnormally elongated congenitally or by acquisition. The ileum joins the large intestine in the right inguinal region, at right angles to the larger gut, and from two to three inches from its lower blind extremity. The small intestine opens by a valvular orifice, the ileo- csecal valve, into the larger. This opening is behind a line joining the anterior superior iliac spine and the um- bilicus, and at a distance of three inches from the first point.

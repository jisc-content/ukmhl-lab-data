(2) The Ling-ual Artery: The second branch from the front of the external carotid. Its course is forward and upward around the great cornu of the hyoid bone, then beneath the hyoglossus muscle, then under the tongue (as the ranine artery) to its tip. The artery is reached for purposes of ligation through the lingual triangle. See page 85. Branches of the Lingual: (a) The hyoid; this runs for- ward over the hyoglossus muscle just above the hyoid bone. (^) The dorsal artery of the tongue is a branch from the lingual under the hyoglossus muscle ; it passes upward to the back of the tongue. It supplies not only the tongue but small branches to the tonsil and fauces. {c^ The sublingual is given off at the anterior border of the hyoglossus muscle, passes forward under the mylohyoid muscle to the sublingual gland, floor of the mouth, and in its course supplies the adjacent muscles. The artery of the fraenum is a branch from the subHngual. {d) The ranine, or the last portion of the lingual along the under surface of the anterior portion of the tongue, to its tip. Supplies the tongue and the surrounding muscles. (3) The Facial Artery (in the neck). Arises from the front of the external carotid as the third branch, or with the lingual by a branch common to both. It takes a tortuous course upward and forward, under the posterior belly of the diagastric and the stylohyoid muscles, through the upper and back part of the submaxillary gland, which it deeply grooves, then turns upward on to the face, over the lower jaw, just in front of the masseter muscle. For its course in the face, see page 64.

357 THE THORAX. from collapsing like the oesophagus by the introduction of incomplete rings of cartilage. These cartilaginous arches are incorporated within the structure of the tube. Their opening is placed behind, and the gap filled in with muscular tissue. The trachea is the continuation of the air tube below the larynx, or the cricoid cartilage. It terminates at its bifurcation into the two bronchi at the fourth or fifth thoracic vertebra. Its length is about five inches and its diameter nearly an inch. Relations.â€”In the neck : In front, skin, fasciae, anterior jugular veins, their communicating and the inferior thyroid veins, the isthmus of the thyroid gland, branches of the superior thyroid artery. Laterally (and in front), sterno- hyoid, sternothyroid muscles, lobes of the thyroid gland. Laterally, lobes of the thyroid gland carotid sheath and its contents. Behind, oesophagus (and at sides, recurrent laryngeal nerves and the inferior thyroid arteries). In the chest: In front, origin of muscles as above. Re- mains of the thymus gland. Left innominate vein, trans- verse aorta, and the diverging innominate and left common carotid arteries, the deep cardiac plexus. Laterally, the lungs and their pleurae, the pneumogastric nerves, and on the left side the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Behind, the oesophagus. The blood supply is from the inferior thyroid arteries, the nerve supply from the pneumogastrics, recurrent laryngeals, and sympathetic nerves. The Bronchi. Fig. 73. Diag. 22. These are constructed the same as the trachea, of which they are the terminal branches. The bifurcation of the trachea is not at the middle plane of the trachea, but more to the left side, consequently the

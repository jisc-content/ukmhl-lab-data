397 THE PERINEUM, MALE. THE PERINEUM, Male. The perineum is a diamond-shaped space corresponding to the boundaries of the pelvic outlet. The pelvic outlet is formed by the lower borders of the ossa innominata joined in front at the symphysis and be- hind by the wedge-shaped sacrum. Landmarks. The borders of the perineal space can be felt, and are formed by the under surface of the pubic arch, in front; the rami of the pubes and ischium, and the tuberosities of the latter, at the side anteriorly; the lower border of the gluteus maximus, beneath which can be outlined the great sacrosciatic ligaments, at the side posteriorly ; and the tip of the coccyx in the posterior median line. In the median line, in front of the coccyx, is the anus, and in front of the anus reaching up to the base of the scrotum is the bulb of the penis. Laterally, in the anterior part of the perineum, the crura of the penis will be felt covering the ischiopubic rami ; and posteriorly, at the side of the anus, is a depression filled with fatâ€”the ischiorectal fossa. The perineum is divided by a transverse line from the tuberosities of the ischium into the anterior compartment, or the perineum proper, and the posterior division, or the ischiorectal fossae. In order to understand the construction of the pelvic floor it will be well to first study the arrangement of the fasciae which assist in closing the pelvic outlet and support the pelvic viscera in position. Start from the interior of the pelvis. Attached to the inner surface of the obturator membrane and the margin of the bone adjacent thereto,

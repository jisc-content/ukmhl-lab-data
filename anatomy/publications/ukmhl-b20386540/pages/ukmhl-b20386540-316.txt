The cervical nerves emerge along the side of the neck between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles. The first dorsal passes over the upper border of the first rib to join the last cervical nerve. The plexus is conveniently divided into stages for de- scription :â€” (i) The nerve 7'oots. (2) The junction of the nerves to form trtL7tks^ the fifth and sixth nerves forming the upper, the seventh the middle, and the eighth and first dorsal the lower trunks. (3) The division of these trunks into anterior and posterior branches. The division is about equal in the upper and middle trunk, but in the lower the anterior division is much larger th^n the posterior. (4) The union of these divisions to form co7'ds. The anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks forming the outer cord. The anterior division of the lower trunk continuing as the inner cord, and the junction of the posterior divisions of all three trunks forming the posterior cord. The first and second portions of the plexus lie in the neck above and to the outside of the subclavian artery. The third portion is behind the clavicle and the subclavius muscle and at the outside of the axillary artery. The fourth portion surrounds the axillary artery, the outer cord being to the outside, the inner cord to the inside, and the posterior cord behind, the axillary artery. Blanches of the Plexiis.

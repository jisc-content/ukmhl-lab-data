The anterior commissure is devel- oped from the lamina terminalis. The basal gray commissure is that portion of the floor of the third ventricle which is formed by the lamina cine- rea, tuber cinereum, and posterior perforated space. The bundle of Vicq d' Azyr is a band of white fibres which passes from a corpus albicans vertically into the an- terior extremity (anterior tubercle) of the optic thalamus. It was formerly described as a continuation of the anterior pillar of the fornix, which, after reaching the base of the brain, suddenly bent upward on itself (forming the corpus albicans) and passed to the optic thalamus. The optic thalami, pineal gland, pituitary body, and the upper arm of the optic nerve arise from the walls of the interbrain, while its central cavity remains as the third ventricle. DISSECTION. After studying the crura cerebri externally, transverse sections should be made of them as far back as the posterior quadrigeminal bodies. The Crura Cerebri. Figs. 29, 38, 39, 40, 45, 46, 50, 53, These are the rounded bundles of fibres which pass down- ward from the under surface of the cerebrum. They are oval in cross section and united along the posterior half of their opposing surfaces, while the anterior portions are separated, and in the interval between them is found the posterior perforated space and the third nerves. The crura cerebri are continuous posteriorly, around the aqueduct of Sylvius, with the quadrigeminal lamina. Portions of the crura cerebri have been named for pur- poses of distinction. On a transverse section there will be seen a dark or black semilunar-shaped nucleus, which is

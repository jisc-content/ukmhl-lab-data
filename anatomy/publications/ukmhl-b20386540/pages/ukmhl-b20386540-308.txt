From the ulnar there passes into the palm with the deep communicating artery the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve. It also sends branches to the palmaris brevis and little finger muscles. Superficial Layer of Palmar Muscles. Abductor Pollicis. Fig. 66. Origin.—From the tuberosity of scaphoid, ridge of trape- zium, and fibres of palmar fascia, annular ligament, and tendon of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Insertion.—Into the anterior side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb and the aponeurosis of the extensor longus pollicis. Nerve Supply.—Median. (Filaments from the sixth cer- vical nerve.) Action.—To abduct, flex thumb, and (through its attach- ment to the thumb extensor) it will slightly extend the last phalanx of the thumb. (See action of lumbricales and interossei.) Outer Head of the Flexor Brevis Pollicis. (For the inner see page 308.) Fig. 66. Origin.—From the annular ligament and ridge of trape- zium. Ijisertion.—The outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Nerve Supply.—From the median (filaments from the sixth cervical). Actio7t.—Flexion of the carpometacarpal and metacar- pophalangeal articulations of the thumb. Acts with ab- ductor pollicis. For deeper muscles of thumb see page 308. Abductor Minimi Digiti. Fig. 66. Origin.—From the pisiform bone.

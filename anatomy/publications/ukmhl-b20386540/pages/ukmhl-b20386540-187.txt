THE BRAIN. 187 zontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius and is continuous with the ascending parietal convolution, and a posterior portion, which similarly embraces the extreme posterior part of the first temporal sulcus, and is called the angular convolution. The supramarginal convolution connects the ascending pa- rietal with the first temporal and the angular convolutions. The angular convolution connects the first and second (superior and middle) temporal convolutions with each other and also with the middle occipital convolution. The Temporal Lobe. Figs. 23, 24, 25. This is composed of all the cerebrum lying below the fis- sure of Sylvius. It rests upon the middle fossa of the skull, and posteriorly becomes insensibly continuous with the occipital lobe. The external surface of the temporal lobe is divided by the superior or parallel and middle sulci into three convolu- tions, the superior (first), middle (second), and inferior (third) temporal convolutions. These run parallel with the fissure of Sylvius and behind are continuous with the con- volutions of the parietal and occipital lobes, viz. : The superior convolution with the supramarginal and angular convolutions, the middle temporal with the middle occipital, and the inferior temporal with the inferior occipital convo- lution. The parallel or superior temporal sulcus follows the direction of the Sylvian fissure and, like that fissure, turns upward at its terminus. Curving over the upturned ex- tremity of this sulcus is the angular convolution of the parietal lobe. The Central Lobe, or the Island of Reil. Fig. 25. This lobe is seen only after separating the sides of the fissure of Sylvius. It is the portion of the cerebrum which

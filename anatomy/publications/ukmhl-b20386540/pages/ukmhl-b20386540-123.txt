123 THE NECK, ANTERIOR, The Stylohyoid Ligament. This is the fibrous band or cord which connects the tip of the styloid process with the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. It serves to hold the latter in position. The Pterygomaxillary Ligament. This consists of the fibrous interval between the buccina- tor muscle in front and the superior constrictor muscle behind, and extends from the tip of the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate to the posterior extremity of the mylohyoid ridge. The Stylomaxillary Lig-ament. This is that portion of the deep cervical fascia which ex- tends from the front of the styloid process to the posterior border of the ramus and angle of the inferior maxillary bone. It separates the masseter muscle and parotid gland exter- nally from the internal pterygoid muscle and submaxillary gland internally. Pteryg'oideus Externus. Oidgin.—Upper head, from the under surface of the great wing of the sphenoid bone between the foramen ovale and spinosum and the pterygoid ridge. The lower head, from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate. Insertion.—Into the front of the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw, and the interarticular fibrocartilage of the temporomaxillary articulation. Nerve Supply.—The inferior maxillary nerve. Action.—To draw the interarticular cartilage and the con- dyle of the jaw forward (and inward). If both muscles act, the jaw is projected directly forward ; when one acts, the jaw is turned to the opposite side ; if they act alternately, the jaw is moved from side to side, as in the grinding movement.

624 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The artery lies between the semimembranosus and biceps above, and between the two heads of the gastrocnemius below, the plantaris being at the outer side. Branches of the Popliteal. (1) Muscular or sural. These are divided into two groups, superior and inferior, from the upper and lower por- tions of the popliteal. The superior are three or four in number, supply the structures of the upper half of the popliteal space and anas- tomose with the lower perforating branches of the profunda, and the superior articular branches of the popliteal. The inferior sural, two in number, supply the muscles at the lower part of the popliteal space and calf of the leg. From the inferior sural cutaneous branches are given off to the superficial structures upon the back of the leg. A larger branch may accompany the external saphenous vein ; if present it is called the external saphenous artery. (2) Articular. Five in number. Figs. 119, 121, 128, 129, 130. (ci) The superior external articular. Passes transversely outward above the external head of the gastrocnemius and under (in front of) the biceps to the front of the outer side of the upper part of the knee, where it anastomoses with the descending branch of the external circumflex, above ; the deep branch from the anastomotica magna and the superior internal articular, across the front of the knee; and the inferior external articular, below. [B) The inferior external articu- lar. This takes a course outward under (in front of) the external head of the gastrocnemius, then under the external lateral ligament of the knee and tendon of the biceps muscle (just above the head of the fibula) to the front of the lower part of the knee, where it anastomoses with the external superior external articular, above ; the anterior tibial recur-

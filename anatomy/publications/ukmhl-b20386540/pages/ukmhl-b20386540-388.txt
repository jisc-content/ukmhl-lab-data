Is a branch from the musculospiral just above the exter- nal (epi)condyle in the interval between the supinator longus and the brachialis anticus. See page 318. It descends to the anterior surface of the supinator brevis, through which it passes to the back of the forearm, where it is found under the superficial layer of muscles. As it descends it passes under the deep muscles to the interosseous membrane, upon which it lies, and ends just above the wrist-joint in a small ganglion. The nerve gives off branches to all the muscles at the back of the forearm and the ganglion, to the wrist and carpal joints. The Termination of the Anterior Interosseous Artery. Fig. 79. This is found coming through the interosseous membrane about an inch and a half above the wrist. It descends to the back of the wrist, where it enters into an anastomosis with the posterior carpal of the radial. In its course it forms an anastomosis with the posterior interosseous above the wrist. The Recurrent Interosseous Artery. Fig. 79. Is a branch of the common or the posterior interosseous. It is found on the back of the forearm as it curves upward over the supinator brevis. It runs upward between this muscle and the anconeus to the back of the elbow-joint between the external (epi) condyle and the olecranon pro- cess, where it enters into the elbow anastomosis.

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 317 muscular to the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor profundus digitorum (inner portion). In the hand, digital to the inner side of the little finger, the adjacent sides of the little and ring fingers ; communicating to the inner digital branch of the median; muscular to the palmaris brevis, flexor, abductor, and opponens minimi digiti, to the two inner lumbricals, all the interossei, the adductor and inner head of the flexor brevis poUicis (adductor obliquus). {e) The inner head of the median. The median nerve. The median nerve is formed at the outer side of the third portion of the axillary artery by a branch from the outer and inner cords, the branch from the inner cord crossing in front of the artery to get to its outer side. The nerve then continues down the front of the arm in the same sheath with the brachial artery, cross- ing either in front or behind the artery to attain its inner side at the elbow. From the elbow the nerve descends through the forearm, passing between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, then between the flexor sublimis and the flexor profundus digitorum muscles. At the wrist the median traverses the central compartment of the annular ligament and enters the palm, where it breaks up into its terminal branches. At the elbow, the median gives ofl' an articular branch to the joint and muscular to the super- ficial layer of muscles ; these muscles are the pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor sublimis digitorum ; then through its anterior interosseous branch it supplies the flexor longus pollicis, the outer side of the flexor profundus digitorum, and the pronator quadratus. In the hand, the median supplies the abductor, opponens, and outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis muscles, and the outer two lumbricals. The digital distribution is to the thumb, the index, middle, and outer side of the ring fingers.

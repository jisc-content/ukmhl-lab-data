UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, POSTERIOR. 371 found at the back it is covered by the trapezius, levator anguli scapuli, rhomboid muscles. Its course is around the upper angle and along the vertebral border of the scapula to its lower angle. It anastomoses, (a) in the supraspinous fossa, with the suprascapular ; {b) in the infraspinous fossa, with the dor- salis scapulae, and (c) at its terminus with the subscapular. Its muscular branches supply the adjacent muscles. The Suprascapular Artery and Nerve. Fig. 77. The artery is one of the branches of the thyroid axis. See page 112. Origin of nerve. See page 315. In this part of the dissection it is found passing into the supraspinous fossa over the transverse ligament of the scapula, while the suprascapular nerve passes under it, through the foramen which it forms out of the notch in the scapula. The nerve and artery take the same course through the supraspinous fossa and great scapular notch, and terminate in the infraspinous fossa. Both supply the supra- and infra- spinatus muscles and the shoulder joint. The artery anastomoses with the posterior scapular in the [supraspinous fossa, the dorsalis scapular in the infraspinous fossa, and the acromial branch of the acromiothoracic over the spine and acromial process of the scapula. The Dorsalis Scapulae. Fig. 77. This large branch from the subscapular (really the con- tinuation of the artery) appears at the back in the triangular interval between the subscapularis above, the teres major below, and the long tendon of the triceps at the outer side, and under cover of the teres minor, between which and the bone it passes into the infraspinous fossa to anastomose with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries.

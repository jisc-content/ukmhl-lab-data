All these branches in the parotid gland He anterior or superficial to the external carotid artery and the temporo- maxillary vein. The Temporal Artery. Figs. 2, 3. Branches of the trunk of the temporal artery. The ante- rior auricular passes to the top and front of the ear; the orbital is a small branch which runs forward to the orbit between the two layers of the temporal fascia (see page 30) ; the middle temporal perforates the temporal fascia and muscle, just above the zygomatic arch, to reach the under surface of the temporal muscle and ramify in the fossa there ; and the transverse facial, which is seen to run forward from the parotid gland, just below the zygomatic arch, between the arch and Stenson's duct, to anastomose with the infra-orbital branch of the internal maxillary in front, and the muscular branches of the facial below ; be- sides these there are small twigs given to the parotid gland and temporomaxillary articulation. The Facial Vein. Figs. 3, 15. This starts at the inner angle of the eye as the continua- tion of the angular vein. It takes a direct course down- ward and outward under the greater and lesser zygomatic muscles and platysma to the facial notch in the lower jaw, where it lies posterior to the artery. In its course it re- ceives branches corresponding to the branches of the facial artery, and communicates with the infra-orbital vein. For continuation in neck, see page 74. Depressor Ang-uli Oris. Origin.â€”From the external oblique line of the inferior maxillary bone.

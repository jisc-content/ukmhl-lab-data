579 THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. The Deep Femoral—Profunda Femoris. Figs. 117, 118, 119, 120. This is the largest and most important branch of the femoral. It arises from the outer and back part of the femoral at a point varying from one to two inches from Poupart's ligament, the average distance being about one and one-half inches. Its course is downward and inward behind the femoral artery and vein, then behind the ad- ductor longus muscle, behind which it continues to just above the femoral opening in the adductor magnus, when it perforates the latter close to its insertion and enters the popliteal region as the last perforating artery. In its course it lies upon the iliacus, pectineus, adductor brevis and magnus muscles. The vastus internus is at the outer side of the artery. The Branches of the Profwtda. (i) The External Circumflex.—It arises from the outer side of the profunda near the latter's origin. It passes outward under the sartorius and rectus femoris muscles, interlacing with the branches of the anterior crural nerve, and at the outer side of the thigh divides into the ascending, transverse, and descending branches. (ci) The ascending branch (or branches) takes an upward course in the interval between the tensor vaginae femoris, sartorius, rectus femoris, gluteus medius and minimus, and iHacus muscles. It supplies all these muscles, also, the hip joint, and anastomoses with branches from the superior gluteal and deep circumflex iliac arteries. The transverse branch (one to three) winds outward around the femur, under the vastus externus, to anastomose at the back of the thigh with the first perforating of the profunda, the sciatic, and internal circumflex arteries. (See page 614.) (c) Descending branches: These are large ones which turn

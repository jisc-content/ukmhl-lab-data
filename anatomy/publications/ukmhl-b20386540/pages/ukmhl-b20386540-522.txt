520 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, lower intercostals, lumbar, and lateral branches of the deep epigastric arteries. The External Iliac Veins. Figs. 103, 104, T05. They begin under Poupart's ligament, as the continuation of the femoral veins, at the inside of the external iHac arteries. Each passes upward along the inside of the artery to ter- minate where the artery begins by joining with the internal iliac vein to form a common iliac vein. The left vein is at the inner side of the artery for its entire course, and posterior to the artery. The right vein starts at the inner side of the artery and at its termination has begun to pass behind it. Tributaries.—The deep epigastric, and circumflex iliac veins, which collect the blood from the area supplied by the arteries of the same names, also a pubic vein which joins the obturator and external iliac veins. The Internal Iliac Veins will be given later. The Common Iliac Vein. Figs. 103 to 106. Is formed by the junction of the external and internal ihac veins. It extends from the sacro-ihac articulation to the right of the aortic bifurcation, where they unite to form the vena cava inferior. The left vein is behind and at the inside of the left artery, and ends behind the right artery. The right vein is first behind, then behind and at the out- side of its artery. Tributaries,—The iliolumbar, and middle sacral veins. The Vena Cava Inferior. Fig. 106. Is formed at the right of the abdominal aorta, and behind the right iliac artery over the fifth lumbar vertebra, by the union of the two common iliac veins, and passes upward

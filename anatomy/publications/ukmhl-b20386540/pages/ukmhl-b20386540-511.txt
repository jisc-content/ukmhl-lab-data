509 THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. The CcBliac Axis. Figs. 104, 105, 106. This is the second branch of the abdominal aorta. It is a large trunk coming off the front of the abdominal aorta just after it comes through the diaphragm. The Solar Plexus. Figs. 74, 106, 107. About the coeliac axis will be found the semilunar gang- lia, the right and left, joined together by numerous nerve filaments composing the solar plexus (abdominal brain). From the solar plexus nerves pass to the various abdom- inal organs with the blood vessels. They form secondary plexuses upon, and take the names of, the arteries they accompany. The Semilunar Gang'lia. Figs. 74, 107. Are irregularly shaped masses, one on either side of the coeliac axis and superior mesenteric arteries. The greater and lesser splanchnic nerves are formed within the thorax (see page 345); after piercing the crus of the diaphragm they enter the upper part of the semilunar ganglion to take part in the formation of the solar plexus. Branches of Coeliac Axis.â€”The coeliac axis divides into the gastric, hepatic, and splenic arteries. The Gastric Artery. Figs. 104, 105. This is the smallest of the three branches. It passes upward to the left to reach the stomach at the junction of the oesophagus, then turns downward, following the lesser curvature, until it anastomoses with the pyloric. Its branches are (a) oesophageal, running upward to the oeso- phagus, to anastomose with the thoracic oesophageal, (U) the branches over the fundus, to unite with splenic branches, (c) terminal, anastomosing with the pyloric.

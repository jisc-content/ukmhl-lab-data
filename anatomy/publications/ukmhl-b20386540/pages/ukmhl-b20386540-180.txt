180 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, Each hemisphere is further subdivided into lobes, for convenience of reference, by the fissures. The fissures of the brain may be divided into three classes :â€” (i) The fissure between the halves of the cerebrum, and that between the cerebrum as a whole and the rest of the brain. To this class belong the great longitudinal and transverse fissures. (2) Fissures entirely within the cere- brum itself, which are formed by the involution of the entire thickness of the cerebral wall. These are the primary fissures and comprise the Sylvian, dentate or hippocampal, parieto-occipital, calcarine, and collateral fissures. Cor- responding to the external depressions of the primary fis- sures are internal elevations within the lateral ventricles of the cerebrum. (3) Fissures within the cerebrum, which are formed by the upgrowth of the outer layer (cortex) of the cerebrum along certain lines, depressions being left between these ridges. The ridges are called convolutions, the depres- sions fissures and sulci. (The former term being restricted to the deeper and earlier appearing depressions of this class). These constitute the secondary fissures (and sulci) and are the Rolandic and callosomarginal fissures and all the re- maining sulci of the cerebrum. The Fissure of Sylvius. Figs, i, 7, 23, 24, 25, 28. The Sylvian fissure, though strictly a primary fissure, belongs to the class of fissures formed by the outgrowth of the cortical wall rather than by an involution of the entire thickness of the cerebral wall. It appears during the third month of development, oppo- site the floor of the interbrain, where the mass of cells which is to form the corpus striatum is found. Its shape is first triangular, and at the bottom of the tri-

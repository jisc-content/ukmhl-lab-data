Is attached to the crest of the ilium, the outer part of Poupart's ligament blending with the transversalis fascia ; when the femoral vessels are reached it passes behind them to form the posterior layer of their sheath (as the transver- salis does the anterior layer) ; it is then attached to the ilio- pectineal line, brim of the true pelvis, to the bodies and intervertebral substances, and bases of the transverse pro- cesses of the lumbar vertebrae, as well as to the tendinous arches which bridge over the lumbar arteries ; when the diaphragm is reached this fascia becomes thickened to form the ligamentum arcuatum internum, extending from the body of the first to the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra, arching over the psoas muscle ; along the outer margin of the psoas the fascia is attached to the ante- rior lamella of the lumbar fascia. It is the existence of this fascia that determines the course of purulent collections beneath it to point beneath Poupart's ligament at the outer side of the femoral artery, forming a psoas abscess. Such abscesses are, in the great majority of cases, due to tubercular disease of the lumbar vertebrae (Pott's disease). The anterior layer of the lumbar fascia is seen covering the quadratus lumborum muscle. Its attachments have already been given (see page 451). Below, it becomes attached to the crest of the ilium and the iliolumbar liga- ment ; above, it forms the lig-amentum arcuatum exter- num, q. V. (page 451). The Femoral Opening*. Figs. 103, 106.

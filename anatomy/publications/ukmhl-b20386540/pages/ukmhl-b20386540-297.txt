UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 295 the inner margin of the coronoid process of the ulna. (3) From the oblique ridge on the front of the upper part of the radius. See note, page 290. Insertion.—By four tendons which perforate the tendons of the long flexor muscle (as described in the dissection of the hand, see page 311), and are attached to the sides of the the second set of phalanges of the four fingers. Nerve Supply.—The median (seventh and eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves). Action.—Beginning from below, the muscle will flex the second, then the first set of phalanges, then the hand, and perhaps slightly the forearm. DISSECTION. Remove the flexor sublimis digitorum from its radial attachment and turn it inward, cleaning the median nerve, interosseous arteries, and nerve. Finish the ulnar artery ; clean the last layer of muscles. The Ulnar Artery. Fig. 67. This is the other branch of brachial bifurcation just below the elbow. It passes inward and downward under all the superficial layer of muscles, and also between the flexor sublimis and profundus digitorum. At the middle and upper thirds of the forearm it bends directly downward and enters the wrist over the annular ligament at the outer side of the pisiform bone. The course of the lower two-thirds of the artery is indi- cated by a line from the internal condyle to the outer side of the pisiform bone. The guide to the artery is the inter- muscular septum between the flexor subhmis digitorum and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The artery has two accompanying veins. Relations.—In front: Pronator radii teres, flexor carpi

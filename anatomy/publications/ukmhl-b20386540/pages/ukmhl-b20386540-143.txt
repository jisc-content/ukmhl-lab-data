THE HEAD AND NECK, POSTERIOR. 143 in front of this blind depression the ''V-shaped" group of circumvallate papillae. A third mass of adenoid tissue is seen at the base of the tongue and in front of the epiglottis ; this is the lingual tonsil. Below and behind the base of the tongue stands the epi- g'lottis to protect the opening of the larynx, which presents posterior and inferior to it. The epiglottis is connected to the base of the tongue by the general covering of mucous membrane which is thrown into three folds, one in the medial line and two laterally, which are called the median (fraenum epiglottidis) and lateral glosso-epiglottic folds. On both sides of the frae- num epiglottidis is a shallow depressionâ€”the glosso-epi- glottic pouch. From the sides of the epiglottis backward to the top of the larynx the mucous membrane is thrown into a promi- nent ridge, the aryteno-epiglottic fold. The upper mar- gins and cornua of the thyroid cartilage can be easily appre- ciated. DISSECTION. Remove the mucous membrane which covers the interior of the pharynx, the posterior surface of the soft palate, and the posterior faucial arches. In dissecting the muscles of the palate and the pharynx (interior), it must be remembered that these are very thin, and their outlines not at all as distinct as the illustrations in the text-books would lead one to think. The student should do the best he can with the aid of such illustrations and the descriptive anatomy to find the various parts. Palatopharyngeus. The thin muscular layer is attached to the soft palate near the median line and arches outward and downward, form- ing the posterior palatine arch, to be attached below to the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage and the lateral wall of the pharynx. At the soft palate the fibres of the muscle

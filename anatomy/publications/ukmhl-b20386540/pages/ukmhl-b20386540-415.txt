THE PERINEUM, MALE. 418 is forward and inward through the compressor urethrae muscle. When near the middle line it penetrates the super- ficial layer of the triangular ligament and enters the bulb. It supplies Cowper's glands, the membranous urethra, the bulb, and the corpus spongiosum, (4) The artery to the crus. The larger of the terminal branches of the internal pudic. This perforates the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, enters the crus penis (corpus cavernosum), through the centre of which it passes to its anterior extremity, giving off numerous branches in its course to this body. (5) The dorsal artery. of the penis. The smaller branch of the bifurcation of the internal pudic. For its course, see above. The Internal Pudic Vein. This begins as a branch from the corpus cavernosum, receives a communicating branch from the dorsal vein of the penis, retraces the course of the internal pudic artery, receiving in its course branches corresponding to the branches of the artery, and finally empties into the begin- ning of the internal iliac vein. The Internal Pudic Nerve. Figs. 82, 83, 112, 114. This is found in the dissection of the perineum, as it enters the ischiorectal fossa through the lesser sacrosciatic foramen along with the internal pudic artery. It courses along the side of this fossa with the artery, being contained in a canal in the obturator fascia, and divides into the perineal and dorsal nerve of the penis (clitoris). Before this division the nerve gives off the (i) inferior hemor- rhoidal branch, which passes inward to the external sphinc- ter of the anus and the integument over it.

388 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. carpal arch the second and third dorsal interosseous arteries are distributed to the third and fourth interosseous spaces. (2) The first dorsal interosseous, or the metacarpal: a small branch from the radial under the tendon of the extensor longus pollicis, to the space between the second and third metacarpal bones. (3) The dorsalis pollicis and (4) the dorsalis indicis are small arteries distributed to the dorsal surface of the thumb and index fingers. The dorsalis pol- licis divides into two branches to either side of the thumb, while the dorsalis indicis supplies the outer side of the index finger. The Collateral Digital Arteries. The dorsal digital arteries divide at the web of the fingers into small branches to the adjacent sides of the dorsal surface of the fingers. The posterior carpal branch of the ulnar is found issu- ing from the front of the forearm under the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. It passes to the back of the wrist and enters into the posterior carpal anastomoses. See above. The Dorsal Interossei. Fig. 79. These are four in number, one on either side of the middle finger, one to the radial side of the index, and one to the ulnar side of the ring finger respectively. Origin.—By two heads from the contiguous sides of the metacarpal bones between which they lie. The origin is more extensive from that metacarpal bone of the finger into which they are inserted. Insertion.—Into the base of the first phalanx, and into the lateral margin of the tendon of the extensor communis digitorum.

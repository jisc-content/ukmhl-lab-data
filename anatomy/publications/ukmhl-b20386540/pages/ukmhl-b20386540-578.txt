A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 576 the inner iip of the linea aspera, from the internal intermus- cular septum and the tendon of the adductor magnus (vas- tus portion). Insertion,— Into the upper border of the patella behind the rectus femoris tendon (the crureus portion), into the inner margin of the patella, and by an aponeurotic expan- sion into the internal tuberosity of the tibia and the deep fascia of the leg (vastus portion). Nerve Supply.—The anterior crural. Action.—To extend the leg ; the vastus internus through its lower fibres resists the outward pull of the vastus ex- ternus. The Lig'amentum Patellae. This is the continuation of the tendons of the four muscles described as attached to the patella, namely the rectus femoris, the vastus externus, the vastus internus and crureus, which having, in common, the action of extension of the leg are known as the quadriceps extensor femoris. The ligamentum patellae extends from the apex and lower margins of the patella to the lower portion of the tibial tubercle. It is about an inch wide above, and three-fourths of an inch below, one-fourth of an inch thick, and from two to three inches in length. The patella should be regarded as a sesamoid bone developed within the tendon of the quadriceps extensor ; its presence renders the action of those muscles much more effective than they would be without it. Adductor Brevis. Figs. 119, 120. Origin.—From the front of the body and descending ramus of the pubes below the adductor longus and between, the gracilis and the obturator externus.

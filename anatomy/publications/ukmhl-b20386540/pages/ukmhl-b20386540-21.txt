THE HEAD, ANTERIOR. 21 by continuing the line from the last point downward and back- ward to the inion, following for the posterior two-thirds of its extent the superior curved line of the occipital bone. The lower border of the cerebellum is indicated by a line drawn forward and downward from the inion to the pos- terior border of the mastoid process at its base. The Lateral Sinus.—This corresponds to a band one- fourth of an inch wide extending from the inion, following the curved course of the superior nuchal line forward to a point one inch directly behind the external auditory meatus. The Nasolambdoidal Line.—This is a line connecting the nasofrontal groove with a point five-twelfths to five- eighths of an inch above the lambda. The Fissure of Sylvius. The Horizojttal Portioji.—This is indicated by drawing a line backward and slightly upward from the Sylvian point" to a point three-fourths of an inch below the most prominent portion of the parietal eminence. The posterior two inches of this line coincides with the nasolambdoidal line. The vertical limb of the Sylvian fissure corresponds to a line one inch long drawn vertically upward from the hori- zontal limb at a point three-fourths of an inch from its beginning, or two inches distant from the E. A. P. The Fissure of Rolando.—Take 57 per cent, of the distance from the glabella to the inion, or (preferably) five- sixths of an inch, behind the mid-point between the nasion and the inion,—this will indicate the central extremity of the fissure of Rolando. From this point draw a line three and three-eighths inches long downward and forward so as to make an angle with the median line of 71.5 degrees. (Cunningham.)

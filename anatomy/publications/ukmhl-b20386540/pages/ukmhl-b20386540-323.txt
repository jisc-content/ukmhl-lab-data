321 THE THORAX. The superior epig'astric continues downward, enters the under surface of the rectus muscle (piercing its sheath), and finally terminates in anastomotic branches with the deep epigastric. The musculophrenic passes downward and outward across the costal cartilages of the false ribs and along the origin of the diaphragm, which it perforates over the ninth rib, to the tenth or eleventh intercostal space. In its course it supplies the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. Relations.—In the neck, the internal mammary is crossed in front by the phrenic nerve, which passes from the outside to the inner side of the artery, and by the subclavian vein. The artery in the upper part of its course is in contact with the pleura, but in the lower is separated from it by the tri- angularis sterni muscle. Branches.—A small artery to accompany the phrenic nerve, given off at the upper opening of the thorax. The anterior intercostal arteries are a pair in each of the upper six intercostal spaces. These turn outward to anas- tomose with the aortic intercostals, supplying the surround- ing parts. The perforating. One for each of the six upper spaces. Pass forward and are distributed to the parts upon the front of the chest. The mammary gland receives blood from the second, third, and fourth. Besides these there are small branches to the mediasti- num, sternum, and pericardium. The internal mammary artery is accompanied by two veins which empty into the innominate vein of that side. Parts Within the Thorax.—If the pleurae have been saved uninjured in removing the sternum and cartilages (and ribs), they will be seen to form a closed sac within which the lungs are contained. By inflating the lungs they will ex- 21

Thoracic portions of the left common carotid and sub- clavian arteries :— The Left Common Carotid. Fig. 71. Diag. 20. Arises from the middle of the upper surface of the transverse aorta, passes upward and outward into the neck. For rest of course see page loi. Relations (within thorax).—In front, manubrium, origins of the left sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles, remains of thymus gland, left innominate vein; behind (and from below upward), trachea, oesophagus, thoracic duct, recur- rent laryngeal nerve ; at the right, innominate artery, trachea, inferior thyroid veins ; at the left, left subclavian artery (behind), left pneumogastric nerve, left lung and pleura. The Left Subclavian Artery. Figs. 70, 71. Diag. 20. Is given off the transverse aorta at its terminus, extends almost vertically upward into the neck, passing behind the left sternoclavicular articulation. Relations (within the thorax). In front : First left costal cartilage and adjacent portions of manubrium, left sterno- clavicular joint, origins of the left sternohyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, left lung and pleura, left innominate vein, left pneumogastric and cardiac nerves. Behind : Thoracic duct, longus colli muscle, vertebrae. At the right: Left common carotid (in front), trachea, left recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus (behind).

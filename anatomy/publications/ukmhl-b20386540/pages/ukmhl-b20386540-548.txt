The right ovarian vein opens into the vena cava, the left into the left renal vein.

The vulvar lymphatics empty into the inguinal glands. Inflammation of the vulva may cause an enlargement of the inguinal glands constituting, as in the male, a bubo. The vaginal and uterine lymphatics pass to the pelvic glands, from the round ligament to the inguinal glands, and from the broad ligament to the lumbar glands. The Nerves are derived from the third and fourth lum- bar, hypogastric, and renal sympathetic plexuses. The Internal Iliac Artery and its Branches. Figs. 112, 113, 114. The internal iliac is the posterior branch of the common iliac, as the external is the anterior branch. The terms ex- ternal and internal as applied to these arteries are misno- mers, for both arteries are internal, within the abdominal cavity, the proper designation would be as indicated, anterior and posterior. The internal iliac descends along the pelvic wall to the upper margin of the great sacrosciatic foramen, where it divides into the anterior and posterior trunk. The anterior trunk gives off the vesical, hemorrhoidal, uterine, vaginal, obturator, sciatic, and pudic branches. {a) The vesical are three in number, the superior, middle.

538 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. space may extend two inches above the top of the symphy- sis. As the bladder rises it takes with it the peritoneum ; consequently, the viscus can be opened in this condition without entering the peritoneal cavity. The extent of space is further increased by inflating the rectum, thus crowding the bladder upward and forward. This manoeuvre is util- ized in suprapubic cystotomies. The True Lig-aments of the Bladder. (a) The urachus. This is the fibrous cord that extends from the top of the bladder to the umbilicus, and represents the canal which connected the bladder with the allantois in the foetus. See Fig. 95. and {c) The obliterated hypog'astric arteries. These fibrous cords extend from the sides of the bladder, where they are continuous with the superior vesical arteries, to the umbilicus. In the foetus they were pervious and carried the foetal blood to the mother, (d) The rectovesical fascia. Parts of this sheet of fascia are designated as the anterior and lateral true liga- ments of the bladder and the ligament of the rectum. See page 399. Relations of the Bladder (when moderately distended). â€”Anteriorly, the inner surface of the pubic bones and anterior portions of the obturator internus muscles. Later- ally, ureters, obliterated hypogastric arteries, vas deferens (in the male, round ligament in the female), anterior branches of the internal iliac artery, levator ani and obtura- tor internus muscles. Posteriorly; the upper, peritoneal surface, with the omega loop ; the lower, nonperitoneal, with the rectum, seminal vesicles, terminations of ureters, and vasa deferentia. In the female the posterior surface is in relation to the uterus and upper part of the vagina. Superiorly, the small intestines and omega loop. Infe-

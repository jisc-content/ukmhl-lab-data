UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR, 301 Nerve Supply.—Ulnar, from first thoracic nerve. Action.—To draw the skin toward the middle of the palm. The palmar cutaneous nerves have already been dis- sected ; their distribution is seen in removing the integu- ment. The ulnar branch supplies the inner, the median the middle portion of the skin of the palm. The Palmar Fascia. Fig. 65. This is the deep fascia covering the muscles (and vessels) of the palm. The outer and inner thirds resemble the deep fascia in other parts of the body in being thin and forming a covering to the muscles. The middle third is so strengthened by additional transverse and vertical fibres that it becomes a very dense fascia. It is narrow above, where it is attached to the annular ligament and receives the fibres from the palmaris longus muscle, spreads out fan-shaped below, where it divides into four fasciculi which pass to the fibrous structures about the metacarpopha- langeal articulations and lateral margins of the bases of the first phalanges for their ultimate attachments. These fasciculi are bound together by cross fibres that near the fingers exist as a separate band and are termed the superficial "j^ransverse ligament of the palm. Between these fasciculi the digital nerves and vessels are passing to the fingers, and the lumbrical and interossei muscles at a deeper level to their insertions. Each fasciculus just over the finger spHts just before its insertion to form a passageway for the tendons of the long flexor muscles to pass on to the fingers. Distally each fasciculus is continuous with the digital sheaths of the flexor tendons. There is another fasciculus from the outer side of the

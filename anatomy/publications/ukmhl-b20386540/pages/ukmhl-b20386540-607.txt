THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. 605 DISSECTION. Divide the gluteus maximus at its outer and middle thirds and reflect the two portions. The outer portion is to be carefully dissected to demonstrate the double insertion of the muscle and the bursa between it and the great trochanter, and the inner portion is to be lifted up and turned back on to the sacrum to show its extensive origin and the bursa which intervenes between the muscle and the tuberosity of the ischium. Divide the nerve and arterial supply close to the muscle. Remove entirely the inner portion of the muscle by cutting it away from its origins. A larg-e multilocular bursa will be found between the tendon of the gluteus maximus and the great trochanter of the femur. A second one intervenes between the muscle and the tuberosity of the ischium. Gluteus Medius. Figs. ii8, 126, 127. Origin.—From the external surface of the ilium between the middle curved line below and the superior curved line and the anterior four-fifths of the external lip of the iliac crest above, from the deep surface of the fascia lata covering it. Insertion.—Into the oblique line upon the outer surface of the great trochanter. The direction of this oblique line is from above and behind, downward and forward. Nerve Supply.—The superior gluteal (fourth and fifth lumbar, and first sacral nerves). Action.—At all times the muscle acts as an abductor of the thigh, and serves to maintain the pelvis level when standing upon one foot, as in walking, etc. The anterior portion of the muscle acts as an internal (forward), the posterior, as an external (backward) rotator of the thigh. Pyriformis. Figs. 114, 126, 127. Origin.—From the front of the lateral margin of the

681 THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. third. From the intermuscular septa and deep fascia of the leg. Insertion (see Dorsum of Foot).—Into the prominent base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The tendon of the muscle lies in front of that for the peroneus longus ; as the two pass behind the external malleolus, one synovial sheath here encloses them both. Nerve Supply.—The musculocutaneous. Action.—To extend the foot, to abduct the foot, to raise the outer border of the foot. In all its actions it is much inferior to the peroneus longus. The Posterior Tibial Nerve. Figs. 128, 130, 131. This is the continuation of the internal popliteal nerve from the lower border of the popliteus muscle to the mid- point between the internal malleolus and the point of the heel, where it terminates by dividing into the external and internal plantar nerves. The posterior tibial nerve lies first at the inner side of the corresponding artery, but crosses behind the artery (just after -the peroneal branch is given off) to the outer side, which position it keeps for the rest of its course. Braitches.—(i) Muscular to the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and flexor longus hallucis. (2) Articu- lar, one or more filaments to the ankle joint. (3) Cuta- neous, internal calcanean (calcaneoplantar). Pierces the internal annular ligament and supplies the integument over the inner side of the heel, and back part of the sole. The Anterior Tibial Artery. See page 593. The Posterior Tibial Artery. Figs. 130, 131. This is the continuation of the popliteal, of which it is the larger terminal branch, from the lower border of the

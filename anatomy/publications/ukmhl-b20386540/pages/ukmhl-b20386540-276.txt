274 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. Insertion.—Into the middle third of the lower surface of the clavicle, between the conoid and rhomboid ligaments. Nerve Supply.—Supraclavicular, from the first trunk of the brachial plexus (fifth and sixth nerves). Action.—To depress and draw forward the clavicle, to prevent outward displacement of the clavicle. Pectoralis Minor. Fig. 62. Origin.—By three sHps from the anterior surfaces and upper borders of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs near their cartilages. From the intercostal aponeurosis of the in- cluded spaces. Insertion.—Into the inner side and tip of the coracoid process of the scapula, and inner side of the tendon of the coracobrachialis and biceps muscle. Nerve Supply.—The internal anterior thoracic from the inner cord (eighth and first dorsal nerves). Action.—(i) On the scapula. To depress, adduct, and draw forward the shoulder. (2) On chest. If the scapula is fixed it will tend to spread the ribs and raise them, thus assisting in inspiration. DISSECTION. Section the pectoralis minor near its insertion, turn the inner part inward and save the nerve and blood supply to it. Complete the dissection of the axillary space, beginning with the axillary vein, which can be removed between two ligatures (one at its beginning and one at its ending), after studying it carefully and noting its relations. Observe the location of the lymphatic glands, especially those along the long thoracic artery and axillary vein. Trace the branches of the axillary artery, the nerves contained in the axilla, and clean the presenting surfaces of the subscapularis, serratus mag- nus, teres major, and latissimus dorsi muscles, being sure to remove all the tissue filling the space between the various muscles. The Lymphatics. The axillary lymphatics are from ten to twelve in num-

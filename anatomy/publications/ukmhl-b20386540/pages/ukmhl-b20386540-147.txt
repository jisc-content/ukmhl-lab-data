THE HEAD AND NECK, POSTERIOR. 147 Lateral Crico-arytenoid. From the lateral upper border of the cricoid cartilage, into the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. The action is to approximate the vocal cords by drawing the arytenoid cartilages together. Thyro-arytenoid. By a vertical origin from the inner surface of the thy- roid cartilage near the median line. It is attached pos- teriorly into the base and side of the arytenoid cartilage. The muscle consists of two portions, an upper and a lower. The lower portion lies parallel with the true vocal cord and some of its fibres pass into it. ACTION OF THE MUSCLES MOVING THE VOCAL CORDS. {^Frovi Holde7t!) Cricothyroidei, To stretch the vocal cords. Thyro-arytenoidei, To relax the vocal cords and place them in the vocalizing position. Crico-arytenoidei postici, . . . Dilate the glottis. Crico-arytenoidei laterales, . . Draw together the arytenoid carti- lages. Arytenoideus, Draw together the arytenoid carti- lages. Aryteno-epiglottidei, Contract the upper opening of the larynx. Nerve Supply for the Muscles of the Larynx. The external branch of the superior laryngeal supplies the cricothyroid. The inferior laryngeal nerve supplies all the remaining muscles of the larynx. The muscles connecting the epiglottis with the thyroid cartilage (thyro-epiglottideus, with the aryteno-epiglot- tideus superior and inferior) are thin bands of muscular fibres which need not detain the general dissector.

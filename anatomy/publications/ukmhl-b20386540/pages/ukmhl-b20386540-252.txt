A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 250 The Fourth Ventricle and the Posterior and Lateral Tracts of the Medulla. Figs, 39, 54. The fourth ventricle is an elongated, diamond-shaped space communicating anteriorly by means of the aqueduct of Sylvius with the third ventricle and posteriorly with the minute central canal of the spinal cord. The lateral angles of the space are in the recesses left by the junction of the peduncles at the side of the cerebellum. The roof of the ventricle is formed from before back- ward by the valve of Vieussens, the under surface of the cerebellum, and the portion of pia which forms the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle and extends from the postero- inferior surface of the cerebellum to the upper surface of the lower part of the medulla. Remember that this por- tion of pia is composed of loops of capillaries, over which is laid the layer of cells which represents the attenuated roof of the posterior afterbrain, and consequently the plexus is shut out from the ventricular cavity. This layer of pia with its choroid plexus and lining membrane of epi- thelium is called the tela choroidea inferior. Also, re- member that the tela inferior is perforated in the middle line and near the medulla by the foramen of Magendie, and in the lateral recesses by narrow slits of the foramina of Key and Retzius. Through these apertures a free com- munication is offered to the cerebrospinal fluid to pass from the subarachnoidean spaces into the cavity of the ventricles of the brain. The Lateral Boundaries of the Fourth Ventricle.â€” These are : In front, the superior peduncles ; in the middle, the junction of the superior, middle, and inferior peduncles with each other and with the cerebellum ; the posterior portion, by the inferior peduncles (restiform tracts), the fasciculi graciles, and their clavae.

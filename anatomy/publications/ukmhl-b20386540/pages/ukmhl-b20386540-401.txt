399 THE PERINEUM, MALE. lip of the tuberosity of the ischium, blending with the falci- form extension of the great sacrosciatic ligament; behind, about the margin of the great sacrosciatic notch and to the front of the articular surface for the sacrum, and continuous above with the posterior end of the iliopectineal line. By its attachment to the great sacrosciatic ligament the fascia is carried over the lesser sacrosciatic foramen ; underneath the ligament an extension of the fascia is prolonged out- ward, with the obturator internus muscle, into the gluteal region. The obturator fascia is continuous behind with the thin membrane covering the pyriformis muscle ; at its anterior part it is pierced by the obturator nerve and vessels. It is crossed obliquely from above downward by the line of at- tachment of the rectovesical fascia, the so-called ''white line," which curves downward and backward from the inner and upper surface of the pubes across the middle of the obturator foramen and ends at the base of the spine of the ischium. The obturator fascia above the white line " is within the pelvic portion of the abdominal cavity, and is covered by peritoneum ; the portion below is extrapelvic and belongs to the perineum. This perineal or anal portion furnishes a canal (of Alcock) through which the pudic vessels pass. The Pyriformis Fascia. Fig. 113. This is a thin membrane covering the muscle and sciatic plexus of nerves. It is adherent about the origin of the pyriformis and blends in front with the obturator and recto- vesical fasciae. The Rectovesical Fascia. Fig. 113. Diags. 26, 27, 28. This may be said to come off the inner surface of the obturator fascia along a line reaching from the inner.

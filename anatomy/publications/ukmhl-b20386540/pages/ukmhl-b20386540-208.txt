A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 208 ally becomes thinner and is termed the rostrum^ where it passes backward into the lamina cinerea. The part of the corpus callosum between the genu and splenium is the body^ and is thinner than those parts. There is a small extension of the corpus callosum folded beneath the splenium, called the reduplicated fold of the corpus callosum. Fig. 39. The corpus callosum has a bow-shape on transverse section. The concave extremities of the bow arch over the lateral ventricles (whose roofs they form), and the central depressed portion is the portion of the corpus cal- losum which is seen on separating the hemispheres. To the under surface of the corpus callosum is found attached (anteriorly) the septum lucidum and (posteriorly) the fornix. Figs. 41 to 48 inclusive. Remember that these three structures are all de- veloped from the foetal lamina terminalis. Page 173. Diag. 16. The anterior part of the corpus callosum covers in the anterior horn and body of the lateral ventricle, while the posterior part (the tapetuni) forms, in a like manner, the covering for the descending and posterior horns of the same ventricle. The bundles of fibres which radiate to the frontal lobe from the genu are called the forceps 7ninoi^^ while the bun- dles of fibres which pass from the splenium and the redu- plicated fold of the corpus callosum radiate to the occipital lobe and constitute the forceps major. As stated, the corpus callosum is made up of transverse fibres, with the exception of a few thin bundles of fibres which extend from the anterior part of the base of the brain to the forceps major, and use the corpus callosum as a bridge for their course.

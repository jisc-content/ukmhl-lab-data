In the popliteal space the fascia lata is much increased in strength by the addition of transverse fibres which bind together the sides of the space. The external or short saphenous vein pierces the fascia at this place. Upon the inner portion of the thigh the fascia is thinner than elsewhere. The Cutaneous Nerves. These are the terminal filaments of the last dorsal and the posterior branch of the iliohypogastric nerves over the upper part of the gluteal region and the great trochanter ; the cutaneous branches of the sacral nerves over the inner portion of the gluteal region ; the recurrent branches of the small sciatic over the lower portion of the gluteus maximus ; branches from the small sciatic down the back of the thigh^ and popliteal space ; and the posterior branches of the ex- ternal cutaneous (see page 561) along the outer side of the thigh. DISSECTION. Remove the fascia lata from the gluteus maximus muscle, cutting in the direction of the fibres of the muscle. Expose the muscle entirely. Incise the fascia in the middle line from the gluteus maximus to below the knee and remove it from the deeper parts, noting the compartments for the muscles. Save the small sciatic nerve. Clean the muscles of the buttocks, thigh, and the upper part of the popliteal space. Gluteus Maximus. Fig. 126. Origin.â€”From the crest and the outer surface of the ilium posterior to the superior curved line thereof, from the lower half of the posterior and lateral part of the sacrum, from the side of the coccyx, from the lumbar aponeurosis between the ilium and sacrum, and from the posterior surface of the great sacrosciatic ligament.

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 285 Biceps. Figs. 62, 63. Origin.—By a long tendinous head from the top of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, by a shorter muscular head from the coracoid process of the same bone. The former tendon passes over the top of the head of the humerus within the capsular ligament of the shoulder, and blends with the glenoid ligament, and the latter has a com- mon origin with the coracobrachialis muscle. Insertion.—By the broad expansion into the deep fascia of the forearm. By the tendon into the posterior margin of the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. Nerve Stipply.—From the musculocutaneous, which brings fibres from the sixth and seventh cervical nerves. Action.—(i) It is a feeble flexor and adductor of the arm. Serves to retain the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity. (2) On the forearm. A strong flexor of the forearm. If the forearm has been pronated the biceps acts as a strong supinator, the strength of its action of supination increasing until it is the strongest when the forearm is at right angles with the arm. Brachialis Anticus. Figs. 63, 67. Origin.—From the anterior surface of the shaft of the humerus below the insertion of the coracobrachialis and deltoid (the latter it embraces), and from the anterior sur- face of the internal intermuscular septum. Insertion.—The rough surface at the front and inside of the base of the coronoid process of the ulna. Nerve Supply.—By the musculocutaneous in front and the musculospiral behind. The sixth and seventh cervical nerves supply the filaments. Action.—To flex the forearm upon the arm, or the reverse.

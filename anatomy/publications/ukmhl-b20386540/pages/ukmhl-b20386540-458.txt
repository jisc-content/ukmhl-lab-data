Attachinents.â€”Below, to the crest of the ilium, to the whole of Poupart's hgament (excepting over the femoral vessels, where it passes under Poupart's ligament to form the anterior sheath of the same), fo the outer part of Gim- bernat's ligament, to the ihopectineal hne and inner surface of the pubes and symphysis. In the middle Hne it is con- tinuous from side to side. Laterally, it passes into the loose tissue in those parts. Above, it becomes continuous with the fascia lining the diaphragm. The portion of the fascia beneath Poupart's ligament and arching over the femoral vessels is called the crural arch. The internal abdominal ring- (Fig. 94) is a potential opening through the fascia transversalis, formed by the pas- sage through it of the spermatic cord in the male and the round Hgament in the female. It is situated just above the middle of Poupart's Hgament. From the margins of the internal ring there is a thin layer of membrane projected upon the cord (or round ligament) ; this is the infundibuli- form process of the fascia transversalis. For its forma- tion, see page 460. DISSECTION. Incise the transversalis fascia transversely at the level of the umbilicus and along the middle line, providing it has been demonstrated as a continuous layer; reflect its lov^er portion, which is thicker than the upper and lies in front of the deep epigastric artery, and turn this portion downward. Trace the deep epigastric artery to its source, raising the peritoneum and contents from the iliac fossa. Examine the relations about the internal ring. The remaining portion of the deep epigastric artery has been exposed by this dissection. It is seen to arise from the front of the external iHac close to Poupart's ligament,

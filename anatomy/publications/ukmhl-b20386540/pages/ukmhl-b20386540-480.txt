A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 478 called the broad ligaments pass to the sides of the pelvic cavity. Between the front wall of the bladder and the inner surface of the pubes and lower abdominal wall is a space, not covered by peritoneum, called the space of Retzius. The circuit thus traversed outlines the cavity of the greater peritoneum, to distinguish it from the cavity of the lesser peritoneum or the great omentum. Remember that these two cavities are continuous with each other, but through a constricted neck which is called the foramen of Winslow. This opening lies behind the gastrohepatic omentum, opening at the right into the greater cavity just outlined, and continued at the left into the cavity to be examined. A finger can be introduced from right to left, behind the gastrohepatic omentum, into this foramen. If a transverse circuit be made at the upper part of the abdominal cavity the peritoneum will be seen to have the following arrangement (Diag. 41):â€” It will be easily recognized that the peritoneum lines the anterior and lateral walls of the abdomen. It will also be seen to cover the front of the liver (interrupted by the fal- ciform ligament) and the stomach, and that it connects these organs forming the anterior layer of the gastrohepa- tic omentum. Continued to the left, the peritoneum turns around the fundus of the stomach and passes on to the spleen. The portion of the peritoneum between the stomach and the spleen is the left layer of the gastrosplenic omentum. From the spleen the peritoneum extends to the back of the abdominal cavity, forming the left layer of the phrenosplenic ligament which holds the spleen in place. The fold forming the last ligament turns outward and covers the abdominal wall. Passing to the right, from the upper surface of the liver,

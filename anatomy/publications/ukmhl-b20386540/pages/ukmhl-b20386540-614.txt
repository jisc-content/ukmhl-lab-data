A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 612 and third sacral nerves, issues from the great sacrosciatic foramen below the pyriformis, curves around the base of the ischial spine and re-enters the pelvic cavity and is dis- tributed to the obturator internus muscle. As the nerve crosses the spine it gives a branch to the gemellus superior. Here it lies external to the internal pudic artery. (The artery lies between the internal pudic nerve (internal) and the nerve to the obturator internus (which is external).) The Nerve to the Quadratus Femoris. This muscular branch arises from the third sacral nerve, leaves the pelvic cavity through the great sacrosciatic foramen, close to the bone, then passes under (anterior to) the gemellus superior, tendon of obturator internus, and gemellus inferior muscles, then over (posterior to) the ten- don of the obturator externus to the anterior surface of the quadratus femoris to which it is supplied. The gemellus inferior is supplied by a branch from this nerve. The Gluteal Artery. Figs. Ii2, 114, 126, 127. This is the largest of the three arteries which leave the pelvis through the great sacrosciatic foramen. It is really the continuation of the posterior division of the internal iliac and passes out through the great sacrosciatic foramen above the pyriformis muscle, close to the bone. A half- inch from the margin of the foramen it divides into a superficial and deep branch. (I) The superficial branch. This breaks up into branches which ramify beneath and within the gluteus maximus muscle and supply the surrounding parts. (2) The deep branch. Gives a nutrient artery to the ilium and then divides into a superior and an inferior branch, which pass

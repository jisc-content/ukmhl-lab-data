Figs. 57, 58, 68 to 73. Is a hollow muscular cone, placed with its base upward, backward, and to the right, and its apex downward, for- ward, and to the left. For the surface relations consult description already given. Its dimensions : Length, 5 inches ; breadth, 3 ^ inches ; thickness, 2^ inches ; weight, 11 ounces in the male, 9 in the female. The heart is attached by its base to the great vessels which proceed from it. Its apex is free and in life describes considerable movement. It is divided into four cavities by two partitions, one between the ventricles, the interventricular, one between the auricles and ventricles, the auriculoventricular. The location of the partitions is indicated on the outside of the heart by grooves, the auriculoventricular groove being deeper and better marked than the interventricular. The former is obliterated in front by the pulmonary artery. The heart (and vessels for their first one and a half inch) is covered by the visceral layer of the pericardium, and its cavities are lined by a similar smooth membrane—the endo- cardium—continuous with the lining of the blood vessels. On opening the pericardium the greater part of the heart presenting is composed of the right ventricle and auricle ; the smaller part, of the left ventricle and auricle. The ascending aorta, pulmonary artery, and superior vena cava are also in view.

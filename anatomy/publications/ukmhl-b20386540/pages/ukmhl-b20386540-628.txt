Arises from the popliteal opposite the external articular. It runs inward along the insertion of the inner head of the gastrocnemius, then under (in front of) the tendons of the inner ham-string and adductor magnus muscles to the front of the upper part of the knee and here anastomoses with the deep branch of the anastomotica magna, above ; the superior external articular, across the front of the knee ; and the inferior internal articular, below, (d^ The inferior internal articular. Takes a course downward and in- ward under (in front of) the inner head of the gastroc- nemius muscle, lying upon the popliteus muscle, then passes between the internal lateral ligament and the tibia, to the front of the lower part of the joint. Here it ends in branches which anastomose with the inferior external articular, over the front of the tibia; and the superior internal articular, and superficial branch of the anastomotica magna above. {e) The azygos articular. This comes off the front of the popliteal, at the middle of the back of the knee and passes directly forward into the joint. The arterial anastomosis about the knee joint is arranged in a superficial and deep system. The former lying between the integument and fascia and the latter close to the bones. DISSECTION. Divide the tendon of the plantaris and tendo-Achillis near their insertion and cut the soleus away from its tibial origin. Turn the muscles outward. Clean the deep layer of muscles, and the vessels and nerves. Inasmuch as the deep muscles of the leg pass to their insertion into the foot this part of them has not been dis- sected out at present.

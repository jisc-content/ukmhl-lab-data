586 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Internal Annular Ligament. Fig. 131. This is the portion of the deep fascia reaching from the internal malleolus to the inner lower and posterior borders of the OS calcis. For the relations of the important structures which pass under this ligament, see page 632. The External (Short) Saphenous Vein. This begins at the outer side of the venous plexus found upon the dorsum of the foot. It passes backward along the outer margin of the foot, below the external malleolus, then .upward over the back of the leg, perforates the deep fascia of the leg at the lower part of the popliteal space and empties into the popliteal vein. (For the dissection of the vein at the back of the leg, see page 618.) The vein receives its tributaries from the outer side of the foot, outer and back parts of the leg, and a large vein from the lower part of the thigh just before it perforates the deep fascia. The Internal (Long*) Saphenous Vein. This emerges from the inner side of the dorsal venous arch of the foot. Its course is upward in front of the inter- nal malleolus, along the antero-internal border of the leg to the inner side of the knee, where it lies behind the inter- nal condyle of the femur. Its further course and tribu- taries are given on page 557. The internal saphenous receives the subcutaneous veins from the inner side of the foot and leg. Both saphenous veins communicate with the venae com- ites of the deep parts of the leg by veins which perforate the deep fascia at irregular intervals. They also communi-

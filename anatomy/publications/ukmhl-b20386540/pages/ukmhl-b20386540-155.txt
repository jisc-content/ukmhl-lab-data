155 THE BRAIN, (2) The posterior subarachnoid space is larger than the anterior. It is formed at the base of the cerebellum by the arachnoid membrane which extends from the pos- terior part of the cerebellum to the upper surface of the medulla. It communicates with the spinal arachnoid space below, with the anterior subarachnoid space around the sides of the medulla, and with the interior of the brain through the foramina of Majendie, Key, and, Retzius. The foramen of Majendie is centrally located in the pia which reaches from the under surface of the cerebellum to the upper surface of the medulla, and assists in forming the roof of the posterior part of the fourth ventricle. The opening of Majendie is found close to the medulla and in the middle line. The foramina of Key and Retzius are minute fissures at the extension of the pia into the lateral angles of the fourth ventricle. Other smaller and less important spaces are found (3) Below the falx cerebri and above the corpus callosum, in the great longitudinal fissure. (4) In the fissure of Sylvius. (5) Between the corpora quadrigemina and the anterior extremity of the cerebel- lum. The Pacchionian Grlands, Arachnoidal Villi.â€”These are up-growths from the arachnoid along the margins, and even into the cavity, of the superior longitudinal sinus. They look like small masses of granulation tissue. They penetrate the dura and produce corresponding depressions in the inner table of the skull. The subarachnoid spaces are filled with a lymphatic fluid called the cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid is able to circulate freely from the cord to the exterior of the brain, and even to the interior of the latter through the foramina of Majendie, Key and Retzius. Its usual quantity is about two ounces.

Behind, the aorta rests upon the lumbar vertebrae and interverte- bral discs, the anterior common ligament of the spine, left crus of the diaphragm, and left lumbar vein. At the right, right crus of diaphragm, right splanchnic nerves. Spigelian lobe of the liver, receptaculum chyli, vena cava inferior. At the left, the left crus of the diaphragm, left splanchnic nerves. The Branches, (1) The inferior phrenics. These arteries may arise sepa- rately or by a common trunk from the front of the aorta im- mediately after the aorta appears through the diaphragm, or they may arise from the coeliac axis. They are the right and left, and supply the right and left sides of the diaphragm. The right also sends small branches to the liver and right suprarenal body, the left to the oesophagus, spleen, and left suprarenal gland. The right artery passes behind the vena cava. (2) The Coeliac Axis, see page 509. (3) The rig'ht and left suprarenal. These are small arteries that come off the side of the aorta and supply the suprarenal bodies. Besides these, the suprarenal glands receive blood from the inferior phrenics (superior suprarenal blood supply), and from the renals (the inferior blood sup- ply, the suprarenals themselves being the middle arteries). (4) The right and left first lumbar. See below. (5) Superior mesenteric. Seepage 511. (6) Right and left renal. Each renal artery arises from the side of the aorta, on a level with the first lumbar verte- bra, and passes outward to the kidney, breaking up into several branches to enter at the hilum of the gland. The artery is in front of the beginning of the ureter and behind the renal vein.

Within the lamina terminalis, below the septum lucidum, and in front of the anterior part of the fornix, is developed Diag. i6. Median Vertical Anteroposterior Section, at same stage as pre- ceding diagram, to illustrate the development of the lamina terminalis into the corpus callosum, septum lucidum, fornix, and the anterior commissure.â€”(/. S. H.) i, Corpus callosum. 2, Septum lucidum. 3, Anterior commissure. 4, Fornix. 5, Optic chiasm. Remainder of parts as in preceding diagram. a well-defined band of fibres which serves to connect the opposite forebrains and is called the anterior commissure. The flexures of the cerebral vesicles take place early and consist of a head-bend " at the midbrain, and later a neck-bend" at the junction of medulla and spinal cord.

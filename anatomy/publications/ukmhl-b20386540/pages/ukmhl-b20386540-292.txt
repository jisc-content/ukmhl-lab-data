290 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. inner side of the front of the forearm to the wrist, the posterior passes backward to a similar distribution to the posterior surface of the forearm. The triceps muscle shows at the inside of the arm and should be cleaned, and the musculospiral nerve and the superior profunda artery traced between its two lower heads. (5) The musculospiral nerve. This nerve is the direct continuation of the posterior cord. It is found first behind the axillary, then to the inner side of it and the brachial artery, and disappears with the superior profunda artery by entering the musculospiral groove or canal between the two lower heads of the triceps muscle. DISSECTION. Remove the deep fascia from the forearm as low as the annular ligament of the wrist. Carefully clean the following structures:— Pronator Radii Teres. Fig. 66. Origin.—By the common tendon from the lower half- inch of the internal condyloid ridge and the internal con- dyle, for the upper head ; from the inner margin of the coronoid process of the ulna, by the lower and smaller head ; also from the intermuscular septum between it and the flexor carpi radialis. Note.—It will be stated here for once, to save repetition, that all the mus- cles arising from the internal condyle by the common tendon also arise from the intermuscular septum between each other. htsertion.—Into the rough oval impression on the outer surface of the radius at its middle. Nerve Supply.—By the median, which passes between its two heads. These filaments come from the sixth cervical nerve.

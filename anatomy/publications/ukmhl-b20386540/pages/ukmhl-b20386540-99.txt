99 THE NECK, ANTERIOR. In front of the artery is the pharynx and the tonsil, from which it is separated by the superior constrictor muscle. The course of the artery into the skull is through the carotid canal, within the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and then by the upper part of the foramen lacerum medium, beyond which it enters the cavernous sinus. See pages 43, 53, and 158. The artery gives off no branches in the cervical part of its course. DISSECTION. Leave the remaining structures beneath the lower jaw for dissection with the deep face and turn to the parts at the base of the neck. Working carefully from the superficial to the deep structures, clean them in order, all the time noticing their mutual relations, which are many and com- plex, but which can be far better understood and remembered if in the dissec- tion the student will only take the time to notice and repeat them to himself as his work proceeds. Divide the omohyoid near its middle, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid near the sternum, and reflect them. The Subclavian Vein. Fig. 18. The subclavian vein extends from the lower border of the first rib, beyond which it is called the axillary, to behind the sternoclavicular articulation, where it ends by joining with the internal jugular to form the innominate vein. It lies in front and slightly below the subclavian artery, from which it is separated by the scalenus anticus muscle and phrenic nerve. Tributaries.â€”The external jugular, and sometimes the anterior jugular or the cephalic. The Transverse Cervical and Suprascapular Veins. Fig. 15. These veins are double (venae comites) and return the blood from the region supplied by their respective arteries. Near their terminus each pair unites to form a single trunk,

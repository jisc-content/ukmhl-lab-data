81 THE NECK, ANTERIOR. The Mylohyoid Nerve. Figs. 12, 17. This is a small branch from the inferior dental just before it enters the dental foramen in the lower jaw. It runs downward and forward, grooving the under surface of the lower jaw, and supplies the mylohyoid and anterior belly of the digastric muscles. In its course across the mylo- hyoid muscle it is accompanied by the submental branch of the facial artery. Mylohyoid. Fig. 17. Origin.—From the mylohyoid ridge on the inner surface of the inferior maxilla. Insertion.—Into the body of the hyoid bone, and a median raphe extending from the hyoid bone to the lower jaw. Nerve Supply.—The mylohyoid branch of the inferior dental (of inferior maxillary). Action.—To raise the hyoid bone, and the parts con- nected to it, especially the tongue. To depress the lower jaw if the hyoid bone is fixed. Having dissected out the preceding muscles, replace the sternomastoid and take up the study of the triangles of the neck, their formation or boundaries, the muscles or parts which form their floor, and most especially their va- rious contents and their relations to each other. The Triangles of the Neck. Figs. 16, 17. The side of the neck forms an irregular parallelogram with the following boundaries. Above, by the lower border of the inferior maxilla, the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and a line joining the angle of the jaw with the mastoid process. In front, by the median line. Below, by the top of the manubrium and the clavicle. 6

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 315 to the posterior thoracic nerve, (c) The posterior or long* thoracic nerve is formed in the substance of the scalenus medius by branches from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cer- vical nerves. It passes downward behind the plexus and the beginning of the axillary artery into the axillary space, where it is found coursing along the middle of the serratus magnus muscle, to which it is distributed. (2) From the second portion of the plexus, {a) Nerve to the subclavius. This small nerve comes from the upper trunk just after its formation, descends across the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels to supply the subclavius muscle. (U) Suprascapular nerve. This arises from the upper trunk, passes outward and downward through the suprascapular foramen in the scapula (notch con- verted into a foramen by the transverse ligament), supplies the supraspinatus muscle, the shoulder-joint, continues around through the great scapular notch, and termi- nates in the infraspinatus muscle. All the preceding nerves arise from the plexus above the clavicle. (3) From the fourth portion of the plexus. Below the clavicle. From the outer cord, {a) The external anterior thoracic nerve receives filaments from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves, arises from the outer cord, turns inward across the axillary artery and vein, perforates the costocoracoid membrane, and supplies the pectoralis major. {b) The musculocutaneous nerve. This nerve is the direct continuation of the outer cord. It continues to the outer side of the third portion of the axillary artery and the beginning of the brachial, perforates the coraco- brachialis muscle (supplying it), descends between the biceps and brachialis anticus (supplying both), and as a cutaneous nerve is distributed to the outer portion of the

Beginning above, raise the sternum, dividing the internal mammary arteries as close to it as possible, and remove the sternum and cartilages (and portions, of ribs if they have been sawn through) from the thoracic contents by careful dissection, so as not to injure them. On the Sternum. Triangularis Sterni. (Continuation upward of the trans- versalis.) Origin.—From the internal surface of the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages, the ensiform appendix, and the lateral margins of sternum for its lower third. Insertion.—Into the inner surface and lower border of the second to the sixth cartilages, close to their costal junction. Nerve Supply.—The upper intercostals. Action.—Feeble muscle of expiration, by depressing the inner anterior portions of the ribs to which it is attached. DISSECTION. Remove the above muscle. Trace the internal mammary artery and its an- terior and lateral branches as far as possible. The Internal Mammary Artery. Figs. i8, 68. Arises from the under surface of the first portion of the subclavian artery, close to the inner border of the scalenus anticus muscle, and opposite the thyroid axis. See page 113. It passes into the chest and descends behind the cartilages of the ribs about half an inch from the external margin of the sternum until the sixth space is reached, where it divides into the superior epigastric and the muscu- lophrenic.

THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR, 627 They will be described at this time however, and the student can review them after the foot has been dissected. Plexor Longus Digitorum. Figs. 130, 131, 133. Origin.—From the posterior surface of the tibia, extend- ing from the oblique line to the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the bone, from the deep fascia which covers the muscle, and from the intermuscular septum. Insertion (see Dissection of Foot^.—Into the bases of the last phalanges of the four outer toes. The tendon of the muscle occupies a special fibrous canal lined with synovial membrane behind the internal malleolus (being posterior to the tendon for the tibialis posticus). Turning forward into the foot the tendon crosses below that for the flexor longus hallucis, to which it is connected by a fibrous band, then receives the insertion of the flexor accessorius and divides into the four terminal tendons ; they then pass through a button-hole slit in the tendons of the short flexor and on to their insertion. (See the Lmnbri- cales. Nerve Supply.—The posterior tibial. Action.—To flex the toes, beginning with the last pha- langes and passing backward, to flex the joints of the foot (mediotarsal), to extend the foot. Flexor Longus Hallucis (Pollicis). Figs. 130, 131,' 133. Origin.—From the posterior (and internal) surface of the fibula for its lower two-thirds, from the deep surface of the fascia which covers the muscle, from the intermuscular septa on either side. Insertion (see Dissection of Foot).—Into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. The tendon of this muscle slightly grooves the back of the tibia and astragalus, passes forward under the sustenta-

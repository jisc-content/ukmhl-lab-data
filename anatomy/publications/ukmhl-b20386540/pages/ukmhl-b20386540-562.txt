Into the upper fourth of this band the tensor vaginae femoris is inserted. {c) Internal Process.—An internal process of the fascia lata extends from the notch and inferior anterior iliac spine, along the inner surface of the tensor vaginae femoris muscle, to join the iliotibial band just below the insertion of the muscle. (d^ The Saphenous Opening.—The confusion in the descriptions of the saphenous opening all arise from the fact that the opening does not exist in the normal condition. It is a product of a femoral hernia or of the dissector. Different dissectors manufacture different sorts of openings, according to their preconceived ideas derived from the descriptions they have read, or as a result of careless dis- section, or from the varying conditions of the fascia itself, (for not all fasciae have the margins of the opening equally plain). Stated briefly, the saphenous opening is simply a gap produced by the separation of the iliac and pubic portions of the fascia lata, the iliac portion having the external and more superficial attachment (Poupart's ligament, spine of pubes), the pubic portion having the more internal and deep attachment (to the iliopectineal line and ihac fascia behind the femoral vessels). Through this gap passes the internal saphenous vein, superficial external pudic and superficial epigastric arteries, and the genitocrural nerve. The opening is about one inch below the inner portion of Poupart's ligament, its vertical diameter one and one- fourth or one-half inch, its transverse, one-half to three- fourths of an inch. These measurements are after dis- section. The outer or iliac portion, bounding the opening,

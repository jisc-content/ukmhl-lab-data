A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 38 Now study the parts at the base of the skull. Fig. lo. The base of the skull, internally, is divided into three fossae—the anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior fossa has for its floor the orbital plate of the frontal, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and the les- ser wings of the sphenoid bones. The posterior margin of the last and the optic groove bounds the fossa posteriorly. The Middle Fossa.—This is the central hollow, and its floor is composed of the greater wings and body of the sphenoid and the front surfaces of the petrous portions of the temporal bones. The fossa is limited behind by the superior margin of the petrous portions of the temporal bones and the dorsum ephippii. Anteriorly, by the lesser wings of the sphenoid and optic groove. The posterior fossa of the skull is all that portion of the base internally which extends behind the superior margins of the petrosal bones and the dorsum ephippii. The contents of these various fossae will be apparent as the dissections of the floor of the cranial cavity proceeds. The Tentorium Cerebelli. Fig. 9. This is a portion of the dura which lies between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. It is attached externally to the dura (and so to the bone) along the line of the lateral sinuses (which it forms by the separation of its layers). Internally it is attached to the superior border of the pe- trous portion of the temporal bone (enclosing the superior petrosal sinuses at this point), and to the posterior and anterior clinoidal processes. An opening is left between the petrosal attachments through which the crura cerebri, basilar artery, and third and fourth nerves pass.

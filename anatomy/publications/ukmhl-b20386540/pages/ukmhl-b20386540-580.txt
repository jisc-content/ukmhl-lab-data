578 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. hise^'tion.—At the upper third of the shaft of the femur, into the inner lip of the hnea aspera and the hne extending upward to the lesser trochanter. Nerve Supply.—From the anterior division of the obtu- rator nerve. Action.—To adduct and rotate the thigh outward ; also, a slight flexor of the thigh. Adductor Magnus. Figs. 119, 120. Origin.—From the front of the rami of the pubes and ischium, and from the lower part of the tuberosity of the ischium. hisertion.—Into the back of the femur internal to the insertion of the gluteus maximus, along the whole length of the linea aspera between the adductor brevis, adductor longus, and vastus internus on the inside, and the short head of the biceps on the outside, into the internal condy- loid ridge and ending in a strong tendon, which is attached to the adductor tubercle on the internal condyle of the femur. Nerve Supply.—The obturator through its posterior divi- sion, and the great sciatic which gives a branch to the pos- terior surface of the muscle. Action.—To adduct the thigh, to rotate it outward (the upper part of the muscle); and to extend the thigh (through the fibres arising from the ischial tuberosity). The femoral opening* in the adductor magnus muscle.— This is a gap that is left along the insertion of the muscle at the middle and lower thirds of the thigh through which the femoral artery and vein pass to enter the popliteal space. Besides the opening for the femoral artery and vein the adductor magnus muscle is perforated along its insertion close to the bone by the branches (three) of the profunda which pass to the back of the thigh.

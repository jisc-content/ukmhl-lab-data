2 17 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. THE HEAD, Anterior. The Landmarks. The student should fully investigate the landmarks of the head with especial reference to the subject of cerebral topography. A brief resume of the more important guides is given below. See Fig. i. All hair should be shaved or carefully clipped from the scalp and face. hi the Median Lijte.â€”The nasion is the centre of the nasofrontal suture and is marked by a groove at the root of the nose where it joins the forehead. This is the more accurate point from which to measure for cerebral localizations than from the point usually given, namely the glabella, which is the smooth surface between the superciliary ridges and above the nasion. Next the bregma, the junction of the coronal and sagit- tal sutures, and the lambda, the intersections of the sagit- tal and lambdoid sutures, are useful anatomical points to remember. The former lies half an inch in front of a vertical line drawn upward from the external auditory meatus, the latter 2^ inches above the inion.

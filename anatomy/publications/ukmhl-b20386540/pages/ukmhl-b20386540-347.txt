345 THE THORAX. The Thoracic Sympathetic Nervous System. Fig. 74. This consists of a nerve cord which extends through the chest alongside of the dorsal vertebrae (continuous above with the cervical and below with the lumbar" cord), and a series of enlargements or ganglia, twelve in number, which rest upon the heads of the ribs (excepting the last two, which lie upon the side of the body of the corresponding ver- tebrae). The sympathetic branches are (external) to the intercostal nerves and (internal) to the thoracic viscera. From the lower ganglia are given off the important splanchnic nerves, which, formed in the thorax, pass to the abdomen. (i) The great splanchnic nerve is formed by filaments from the fifth to the ninth thoracic ganglia inclusive, passes through the crus of the diaphragm, and terminates in the semilunar ganglion of that side. (2) The lesser splanchnic nerve is composed of filaments from the eleventh and twelfth ganglia, takes the same course through the diaph- ragm as the great, and ends in the solar or renal plexus. (3) The smallest splanchnic nerve is a small branch from the last thoracic ganglia to the renal plexus. The Brandies of the TJioracic Aorta. (For the artery see page 338.) Figs. 72, 74. (i) Pericardial, a few small arteries to the posterior sur- face of the pericardium. (2) Bronchial, three in number. The right usually rises from the first right (aortic) intercos- tal artery or from the front of the thoracic aorta by a trunk common to it and the left upper bronchial artery. It runs outward to the right lung on the back of the bronchus. The left bronchial are two in number, arising from the thoracic aorta one below the other, and both pass to the left lung along the back of the bronchus. The left upper may arise

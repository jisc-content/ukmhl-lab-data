A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 324 tion of the pleura over the lung is the visceral layer. The pleura also lines the interior of the thorax, diaphragm, and sides of pericardium, and extends upward into the root of the neck about an inch above the clavicle ; this portion is the parietal pleura. These layers are continuous at the root of the lung, and between them is the pleural cavity (not a cavity unless the lungs have retracted into the back of the chest). From the root of the lungs a fold of the pleura descends to the diaphragm ; this is the broad liga- ment of the lung. The lower level of the pleural reflection from the dia- phragm on to the chest wall has been given on page 264. The Thymus Gland. The remains of this structure may be found lying below the left innominate vein and over the transverse arch of the aorta, reaching up into the root of the neck. The Phrenic Nerves. Figs. 18, 69, 70, 72. Each phrenic nerve is formed in the neck by branches from the anterior divisions of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. It descends obliquely downward and in- ward across the front of the scalenus anticus muscle, be- tween the subclavian artery and vein, to enter the thorax, passing in front of the internal mammary artery. It then descends to the diaphragm under cover of the pleura ; on the right side passing along the outer side of the right innominate vein, superior vena cava, and the pericardium ; on the left side, it is to the outside of the transverse aorta and behind the left innominate vein; on both sides they pass in front of the roots of the lungs, and when the diaphragm is reached pierce it and are dis- tributed to the under side of the muscle.

565 THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. abduct the thigh, to rotate the thigh inward ; through the iliotibial band, to flex the leg, to rotate the leg outward, when flexed. Acting from below it preserves the horizontal position of the pelvis upon the femur (in this connection acting with the gluteus maximus), and rotates it to the same side. Rectus Pemoris. Fig. 117. Origin.—By the straight (anterior) tendon from the ante- rior inferior spine of the ilium, by the reflected (posterior) tendon from the outer surface of the ilium just above the acetabulum. Insertion,—Into the upper border of the patella. Nerve Supply.—The anterior crural. Action.—To extend the leg on the thigh, or vice versa; to flex the thigh on the abdomen or the reverse. Pectineus. Figs. 117, 120. Origin.—From the iliopectineal line and the triangular surface of bone in front of it, between the iliopectineal (pubal) eminence and the spine of the pubes. From the under inner surface of the fascia lata covering the muscle. Insertiojt.—Into a line extending from the back of the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera of the femur. Nerve Supply.—The obturator, anterior crural (constant), and the accessory obturator (when present). Actioit.—To flex the thigh, to adduct the thigh, to rotate the thigh sHghtly externally when it is partially flexed, but if the thigh is kept extended it will rotate it internally in the same way that the iliopsoas muscle does. The explanation is this : the centre of motion is at the hip-joint; the mus- cular attachments are to the shaft of the femur two inches external to the centre of motion ; flexion being resisted the

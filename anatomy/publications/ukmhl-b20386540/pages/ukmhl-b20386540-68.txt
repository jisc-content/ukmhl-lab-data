A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 68 The Mental, Infra-orbital and Supra-orbital Foramina. Figs. 3, 4, II. The mental foramen is in the lower jaw, in a line with the supra-orbital and infra-orbital foramina. Through it come the mental nerve and artery (branches from the inferior dental nerve and artery, and these arise in turn from the inferior maxillary nerve and internal maxillary artery). The supra-orbital foramen transmits the artery, vein, and nerve of this name. The artery is a branch of the ophthal- mic, the nerve of the frontal, which arises from the ophthal- mic. The vein empties into the ophthalmic, an important connection to remember. The infra-orbital foramen transmits the artery, vein, and nerve of the same name. The artery is a branch from the internal maxillary, the vein empties into the internal max- illary vein, and the nerve is the termination of the superior maxillary nerve. These three foramina are in the same line, and the nerves which come through them are sensory branches of the three trunks of the fifth cranial nerve. THE NECK, Anterior. The Landmarks. Figs. 14, 15. The region of the neck is limited above by the lower jaw, mastoid process, and a line joining them, and the su- perior curved line of the occipital bone ; below, by the top of the sternum and clavicle ; laterally, by the linear ele- vation formed by the anterior borders of the trapezius muscles. This area is divided in front by the median line into two symmetrical portions. The above boundaries should be identified.

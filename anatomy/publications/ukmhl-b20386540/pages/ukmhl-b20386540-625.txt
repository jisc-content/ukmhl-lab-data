THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. 623 The Popliteal Vein. Fig. 128, The popliteal vein is formed by the junction of the venae comites of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, and passing upward becomes the femoral vein at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle. Its relation to the popliteal artery. It lies behind the artery and crosses it slightly obliquely from below upward, and from the inner to the outer side. The Popliteal Artery. Figs. 128, 129, 130. The popliteal artery is a continuation of the femoral from the opening in the adductor magnus muscle to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it terminates by dividing into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries opposite the lower margin of the tibial tubercle. The course of the artery is indicated by a line drawn vertically through the popliteal space. Relations.â€”The artery rests upon the floor of the popliteal space, which is formed by the posterior surface of the lower end of the femur, the posterior ligament of the knee joint, the posterior margin of the tibia (covered by the posterior ligament), and the popliteus muscle, from which it is separated by the fascia covering the muscle. The popliteal vein lies close behind the artery, being a little external to it above, and slightly internal to it belov/. The internal popliteal nerve is behind (or superficial to) both artery and vein, and crosses them about the middle of the space, from the outer to the inner side (above down- ward). The semimembranosus muscle covers the upper part of the artery (vein and nerve), the inner head of the gastroc- nemius, the lower part of it, the fascia (two layers) and integument for its entire course.

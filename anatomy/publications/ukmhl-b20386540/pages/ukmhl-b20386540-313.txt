UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR, 311 ing, also usually three in number, pass to the back of the hand through the second, third, and fourth interosseous spaces, to end in the dorsal anastomoses. The Tendons of the Long* Flexor Muscles of the Fin- gers. After opening the sheath of one or two fingers and hav- ing seen its formation, notice how the long flexor tendons are attached to the phalanges. It will be seen that the flexor sublimis tendon lies anterior to the profundus until the middle of the first phalanx is reached, where it divides into two parts, which pass around and reunite behind the deep tendon, over the base of the second phalanx. The tendons again divide and pass to their insertion into the sides of the second phalanx. The tendo7ts within their sheaths are surrounded by syn- ovial membrane. These synovial sacs reach from the in- sertion of the long flexor tendons to the heads of the metacarpal bones. The synovial sheaths for the index, middle, and ring fingers are distinct from the great palmar synovial membrane. That for the little finger reaches up to it and may connect with it. See Diag. i8. The g'reat palmar synovial membrane envelopes the tendons of the flexor sublimis and profundus digitorum from the middle of the palm to an inch above the annular ligament of the wrist. This is distinct from the synovial membranes for the fingers, excepting that the sheath for the little finger may open into it. The flexor longus polHcis is surrounded by a similar synovial sheath that reaches from the insertion of the tendon to a like distance above the annular ligament. This sac lies in contact with, and often communicates with, the above sheath for the flexors of the fingers.

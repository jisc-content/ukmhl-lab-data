140 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, Below, it passes along with the great vessels (trachea and oesophagus) into the thorax, forming their sheaths, and becomes continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericar- dium. Laterally, this fascia passes outward under the clavicle with the subclavian artery and vein and brachial plexus, forming their sheath. In the axilla it receives the name of that region (axillary sheath). (4) The fourth or prevertebral layer of fascia. The name indicates its position to be in front of the vertebrae (and their muscles). It lies immediately behind the third layer, and covers over the rectus capitis anticus major and minor, and longus colli muscles. Above, it is attached to the basilar process of the occipi- tal bone. Laterally, to the inner surface of the first layer along the side of the neck ; below, it passes into the thorax behind the oesophagus, and extends into the posterior me- diastinum. While these various layers are described, it should be remembered that they are so described viore for conveniejice and to indicate a general lamination, than to mean that these layers will be found as distinct and separated from each other as the description would indicate. On the con- trary, all these layers blend wherever they come in contact, for the deep cervical fascia is only a part of the connective- tissue system of the body, whose function is to connect and support the various organs between which it is developed. Consequently, the student will obtain a more correct view of the cervical fascia (as well of any other) if he will imagine all the muscles, veins, arteries, and nerves of the neck removed, and the sheaths, capsules, and envelopes of these and the connective tissue which bind them all in position only remaining. This will then show that the

015 THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. It is usually pierced by the coccygeal branch of the sciatic artery. The Small Sacrosciatic Ligament. Fig. 114. This arises from the side of the sacrum and coccyx, an- terior to the great sacrosciatic ligament, with which it blends. It is inserted into the spine of the ischium. It converts the great sacrosciatic notch into a foramen (assisted by the great sacrosciatic ligament to a slight extent). From it arise some fibres of the coccygeus muscle. The Sacrosciatic Foramina. Figs. 114, 127. These are formed by the great and small sacrosciatic ligaments bridging over the great and small sacrosciatic notches as mentioned above. The greater foramen transmits the pyriformis muscle ; above the muscle the gluteal artery and vein and the supe- rior gluteal nerve. Below the muscle the sciatic artery and vein, the great and small sciatic nerves, the internal pudic artery, vein, and nerve, and the nerves to the obturator internus and quadratus femoris muscles. The smaller foramen transmits the obturator internus muscle (its tendon), the internal pudic artery, vein, and nerve, and the nerve to the obturator internus muscle. DISSECTION. Cut through the gluteus medius at its outer and middle thirds. Reflect the two parts. Gluteus Minimus. Figs. 118, 127. Origiit.â€”From the external surface of the ilium between the middle and inferior curved lines, extending from the margin of the great sacrosciatic notch behind, to the notch between the anterior, superior, and inferior spines of the iHum.

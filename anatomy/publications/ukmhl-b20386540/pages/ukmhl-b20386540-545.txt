THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 543 the normal adult it measures about three inches in length, two inches in width at the upper part and one at the lower, and one inch in thickness. It is placed, with its widest dimen- sion transverse, between the bladder and rectum and at the upper end of the vagina, into which it projects. The organ is divided into the body, the upper portion ; the isthmus, the middle narrow portion ; and the cervix, the low^er portion. The cervix is about an inch long ; the upper part outside of the vagina is the extravaginal part, the lower half-inch within the vagina, intravaginal. The intravaginal portion of the cervix presents the opening of the cavity of the uterus, or the OS uteri. Peritoneal Reflections.—The peritoneum is reflected from the bladder over the uterus to the rectum. It covers the body of the uterus in front, and behind descends on to the vagina about an inch before it is reflected on to the rectum. The anterior depression between the bladder and the uterus is the uterovesical fossa; the posterior, between the rectum and the vagina and uterus, is the recto-vaginal, or the pouch of Douglas. The Ligaments of the Uterus.—The peritoneum forms semilunar folds between the sides of the uterus and the bladder in front and the rectum behind ; these are the an- terior and posterior ligaments of the organ. These folds constitute the lateral boundaries of the anterior and posterior, or uterovesical and rectovaginal pouches. From the sides of the uterus the peritoneum extends in a broad double fold to the lateral pelvic wall, forming the broad ligaments of the uterus. In the free margin of each ligament is the Fallopian tube ; on the posterior surface, the ovary connected to the uterus by a band about one and one-half inches long (the Hgament of the ovary) ; at about the middle of the

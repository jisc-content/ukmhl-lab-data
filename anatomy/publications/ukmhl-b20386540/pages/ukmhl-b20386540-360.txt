358 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. right bronchus presents a more conspicuous opening than the left, and therefore is more liable to receive any object inspired into the trachea. The right bronchus gives off a large branch to the upper lobe of the lung and then bifurcates to supply the middle and lower lobes. The left bronchus divides into two branches, one for each lobe. The right bronchus is shorter, wider, and more hori- zontal than the left. Its length is about an inch and its width a little more than half as much. The right pul- monary artery is below and then in front of the bronchus. The azygos major vein arches upward over the bronchus from behind to empty into the vena cava superior. The left bronchus is longer, narrower, and more oblique than the right. Its length is about two inches. In front of it is the aortic arch, the left pulmonary artery is above and then in front of it. Behind the bronchus is the oesophagus, thoracic duct, and descending aorta. The Lung-s. Figs. 59, 68. The lungs are two in number, the right and left. The right consists of three lobes and the left of two. When the chest is intact they fill the pleural cavities,. with the exception of the extreme lower angle between the chest and diaphragm. See page 263. The lung is de- scribed as having an apex, projecting into the root of the neck through the upper opening of the chest, and rising above the first rib about one and one-half inches (three- fourths of an inch above the clavicle) ; a base, concave, to fit over the convexity of the diaphragm, upon which it rests ; an outer convex surface opposed to the interior of the chest; an inner surface, concave, fitting over the peri-

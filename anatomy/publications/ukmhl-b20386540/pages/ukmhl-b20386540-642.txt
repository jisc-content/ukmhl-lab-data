A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 640 collateral digital branches ; the external plantar furnishes the remainder, two digital and three collateral digital nerves. These are numbered from within outward. The Internal Plantar Artery. Figs. 133, 134. The smaller branch of the posterior tibial behind the internal malleolus. Its course is forward and slightly out- ward, under cover of the abductor hallucis muscle, then between this muscle and the flexor brevis digitorum, to the ball of the great toe where it terminates in branches which anastomose with the fifth and sixth plantar digital arteries. The Branches of the Internal Plantar Artery. (i) Muscular, to the adjacent muscles. (2) Cutaneous, to the integument of the inner segment of the sole. (3) Anastomotic, beneath the abductor hallucis to the inner side of the foot to anastomose with the internal malleolar and internal tarsal arteries of the dorsum of the foot. (4) Superficial digital, small branches which pass forward in the inner three interosseous spaces with the digital branches of the internal plantar nerve, and anastomose with the digital arteries. DISSECTION. Section the internal plantar nerve where it appears in the sole. Divide the abductor muscles about one inch in front of their origin, and the flexor brevis digitorum transversely across at its middle. Reflect the parts. The Second Layer. Flexor Accessorius. Fig. 133. Origin.â€”The internal, larger, head, from the inner sur- face of the OS calcis. The external, smaller, head from the outer margin of the os calcis in front of the external tuberosity, and from the long plantar ligament.

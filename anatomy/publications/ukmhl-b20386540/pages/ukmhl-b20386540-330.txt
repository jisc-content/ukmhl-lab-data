A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 328 Tributaries.—The right and left innominate veins, azygos major, mediastinal and pericardial veins. The arteria comes nervi phrenici is a very small artery from the internal mammary to the phrenic nerve just after the latter crosses the former. It accompanies the nerve to the diaphragm. DISSECTION. Make a vertical and a transverse incision in the pericardium. Reflect the flaps ; study the situation and relations of the heart and its great vessels. The Pericardium. Figs. 68, 69. The pericardium is a fibrous sack enclosing the heart and beginning of the great vessels. Below it is attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm, mostly at the left, of the median line ; above it passes on to the great vessels and becomes continuous with the deep cervical fascia from the neck. The fibrous pericardium is lined by a serous layer that is also reflected on to the heart and beginning of the great vessels. The portion of the serous membrane lining the sack is the parietal, that reflected over the vessels and heart is the visceral layer. The serous layer extends upward on to the beginning of the great vessels for a distance of one or one and one-half inches from the base of the heart. Relations.—In front, sternum and cartilages from third to the sixth inclusive, anterior intercostal muscles, trian- gularis sterni, to some extent by the lungs and pleurae ; laterally, pleurae, lungs, phrenic nerves, and accompany- ing arteries; posteriorly, bronchi, oesophagus, pneumo- gastric nerves, descending aorta ; below, the diaphragm,

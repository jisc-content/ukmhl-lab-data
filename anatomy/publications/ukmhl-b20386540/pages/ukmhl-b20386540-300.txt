298 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve is found about two inches above the wrist; it turns backward under the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle to the back of the hand, where it will be found. The Median Nerve. Fig. 67. At the elbow the median nerve lies at the inner side of the brachial artery. It descends between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, then directly down the centre of the forearm between the flexor subhmis and flexor profun- dus digitorum muscles to enter the hand through the cen- tral compartment of the anterior annular ligament with the tendons of the above muscles. It supplies directly the pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor subhmis digitorum, and through the anterior interosseous branch the flexor longus polHcis, the outer portion of the flexor profundus digitorum, and the pronator quadratus. The Palmar Cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves. These small nerves should be looked for just above the wrist, while removing the superficial fascia from the fore- arm ; the median branch is in the middle and the ulnar along the inside of the wrist. Flexor Longus Pollicis. Fig. 67. Origin.-—From the anterior surface of the radius be- tween the oblique line above and the pronator quadratus below, also (often) by a slender head from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, and from the outer part of the interosseous membrane. Insertion.—Into the palmar surface of the base of the last phalanx of the thumb.

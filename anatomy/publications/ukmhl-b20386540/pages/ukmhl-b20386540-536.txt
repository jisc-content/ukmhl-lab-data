A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 534 the former ; under Poupart's ligament it lies external to the femoral artery; a little lower it breaks up into its branches, muscular and cutaneous. See Thigh, anterior. The muscular branches supply the pectineus (by a branch which passes behind the femoral vessel), sartorius, rectus femoris, vasti, and crureus. The hip joint receives a small branch from the nerve to the rectus, and the knee, from the nerves to the vasti and crureus. The cutaneous branches. The middle pierces the fascia lata three or four inches below Poupart's ligament and sup- plies the anterior region to the knee. The internal is dis- tributed to the antero-internal lower two-thirds of the thigh and knee. The long or internal saphenous nerve. Follows the femoral artery through Hunter's canal until the artery turns backward through the opening in the adductor magnus. In this canal the nerve lies first to the outside of the artery, then crosses it in front to reach the inside. From Hunter's canal, the nerve continues downward, passes between the sartorius and gracilis (behind the former as usually given), and appears superficial at the inner side of the knee, and supplies the antero-internal surfaces of knee, leg, and ankle. In its course from Hunter's canal to the knee the nerve is accompanied by the superficial branch of the anastomotica magna artery. In the leg, the nerve follows the internal saphenous vein. Just above the knee the nerve gives off the branch which supplies the antero- internal surface of that joint. (6) The obturator nerve. From the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. Descends between the psoas and base of the sacrum, behind the iliac vessels, passes forward and inward just below the level of the brim of the pelvis and between the peritoneum and pelvic fascia, to leave the pelvis

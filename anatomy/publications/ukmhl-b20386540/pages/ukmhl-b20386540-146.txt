A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 146 Actio7i.â€”To approximate the two cartilages and thus make tense the vocal cords. Posterior Crico-arytenoid. Arises from the quadrilateral posterior surface at the side of the median ridge of the cricoid cartilage. It is inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The action is to slacken the vocal cords and widen the rima glottidis. Arytenoideus. Crosses from one arytenoid cartilage to the other. In action it draws together the arytenoid cartilages, thus narrowing the rima glottidis. Aryteno-epiglottidis. The name applied to a small bundle of fibres connecting the arytenoid cartilage with the aryteno-epiglottic fold. It is a part of the arytenoideus. Arteries passing into the larynx. The superior laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid and the inferior laryngeal branch of the inferior thyroid artery. Nerves of the larynx. The superior and inferior laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric. DISSECTION. Remove these external muscles, clean the fibrous membranes connecting the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone (thyrohyoid membrane), and that uniting the cricoid and thyroid cartilages (cricothyroid membrane). These membranes have to be divided in the operations of opening the larynx or the larynx and trachea. Remove one-half of the larynx. Above the false vocal cord is the fossa innominata; be- tween the false and true cords the ventricle. Muscles of the Interior of the Larynx,

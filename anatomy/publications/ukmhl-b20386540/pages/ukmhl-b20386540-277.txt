UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 275 ber. They are grouped in several sets, two of which are especially worthy of notice. (i) The pectoral set: four or five in number, below the lower border of the pectoralis major and with the long thoracic artery. These receive the drainage from the front and side of the chest (including the mammary gland) ; hence in inflammatory or malignant disease of the chest or mamma these lymphatics are first affected. (2) The axillary set: three or four, located along the axillary vein. These receive the lymph from the upper extremity and from the pectoral set of glands. They be- come enlarged in inflammatory affections of the extremity, or from the chest by extension through the first set. They are closely connected to the vein, especially in the inflamed condition. Their removal should proceed with caution. The Axillary Vein. The axillary vein is formed by the confluence of the ven^ comites of the brachial artery and the basilic vein, at the lower border of the subscapularis muscle. It takes a course upward along the inner side and front of the artery (overlapping it in front), to become the subclavian vein at the lower border of the first rib. It receives, besides the veins which unite to form it, the veins corresponding to the branches of the axillary artery, and the cephalic vein, which passes through the costocoracoid membrane to empty into it. The Axillary Artery. Figs. 62, 63. This is the continuation of the subclavian, from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border of the teres major muscle. It lies near the outer angle of the axillary space. It is divided into three portions by the pectoralis minor, that above, behind, and below the muscle.

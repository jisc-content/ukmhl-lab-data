The interlobular notch is half-way between the right vertical line (see page 435) and linea alba. The fundus of the gall bladder lies just below and behind the tip of the cartilage of the tenth right rib, or in the notch between the right rectus muscle and the thoracic margin. The cartilages given above are areas" not ''points," hence considerable latitude is allowed. The Gastrohepatic Omentum. Diag. 36, No. i. Fig. 103. The double layer of peritoneum which extends from the transverse fissure and under surface of the hver to the upper border of the stomach and first portion of the duodenum is the gastrohepatic omentum. It consists of three distinct parts : (i) A superior, triangular portion of a dense white ligamentous structure,—the tendinous portion. (2) A middle, oval portion opposite the lesser curvature of the stomach. This segment is so thin that it is easily torn and through it can be seen the Spigelian lobe of the liver,—the flaccid part. (3) An inferior part which is thick, massive, and at the right ends in a rounded border which forms the anterior margin of the foramen of Winslow. In this free margin are the hepatic vessels and nerves. The vessels are the portal vein, hepatic artery and duct. The duct is to the right, the artery to the left, and the vena porta behind the two.

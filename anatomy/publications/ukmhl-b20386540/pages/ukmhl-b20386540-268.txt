A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 266 will be seen extending about an inch below the border of the clavicle. In this region, too, will be found the terminal filaments of the sternal, clavicular, and (over the point of the shoulder) the acromial nerves from the cervical plexus. See page 91. Along the front of the chest are the terminal twigs of the intercostal nerves, second to sixth inclusive, and perforating branches of the internal mammary artery. At the side are the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves, second to sixth inclusive. These perforate the fascia along the mid-axillary line. One large one, the intercostohumeral, must be saved. The Mammary Gland. The mammary gland is rudimentary in the male. In the female it varies greatly in size. Usually it covers a space represented by a circle whose centre is at the nipple (see below), and whose diameter reaches from the third to the sixth ribs inclusive. The nipple is usually over the fourth intercostal space, four inches from the median line. It is surrounded by a darker area—the areola—about one inch in diameter. The arteries are the intercostal branches of the internal mammary, through the second, third, and fourth spaces, the long thoracic artery, and often an abnormal branch (external mammary) from the axillary. The veins follow the arteries. The nerves are derived from the fourth, fifth, and sixth intercostal nerves, and from the terminal filaments of the clavicular branch of the cervical plexus. The Lymphatics are Important. The main lymphatic trunks proceed to the pectoral and

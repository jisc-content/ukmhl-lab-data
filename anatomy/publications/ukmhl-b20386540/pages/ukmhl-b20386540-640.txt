A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 638 cular septum, and from the deep surface of the band reach- ing from the outer side of the os calcis (the lesser tuberos- ity) to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. Insertion,—The outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe, the outer side of the base of the fifth meta- tarsal bone. Nerve Supply.—The external plantar. Actio7i.—To abduct the little toe from the middle line of the foot, to flex the first phalanx of the little toe. (Abduc- tion of the first phalanx carries with it the rest of the pha- langes, but flexion is only of the first phalanx). The Internal Plantar Nerve. Figs. 132, 133. This is larger than the external plantar. It is accom- panied by the corresponding artery for a part of its course. It runs forward between the abductor hallucis and the flexor brevis digitorum muscles and ends at the middle of the foot by dividing into three (or four) digital branches. These are named from within outward. (i) The first digital branch supplies a muscular branch to the flexor brevis hallucis and cutaneous branches to the inner side of the great toe. (2) The second sends a mus- cular branch to the first lumbricalis, then bifurcates to sup- ply the adjacent sides of the first and second toes. (3) The third supplies the second lumbricalis, and the contiguous sides of the second and third toes. (4) The fourth ; this communicates with the superficial division of the external plantar nerve, and supplies the opposite sides of the third and fourth toes. The digital nerves supply the joints of the toes which they pass over. Their branches to the toes after their bifurcation are called collateral digital nerves. There are six digital and ten collateral digital nerves, the internal plantar furnishing four of the digital and seven

12 PREFACE, (thoracic and abdominal) relations, obtained by means of " composite " photographs. Questions of theory are stated in conformity with the latest published opinions of recog- nized authorities ; where they differ from previous writers (for example, see the development of the lamina terminalis) both opinions are expressed and the more rational one indicated. All the illustrations are original, and excepting a few cases are from photographs by the author of his own dis- sections. Dissection for Fig. 72 was made by Mr. P. D. Shultz; for Figs. 80 and 81, by Mr. J. J. Moorhead. To these gentlemen, and also to Messrs. Asa Iglehart and G. R. Pisek, for their efficient assistance in the preparation of several dissections of the head and neck and the upper extremity, the writer gladly expresses his thanks. The diagrams are mostly new ; those copied from other text-books are duly credited to their proper sources. Attention is invited to the Index, which has been written up from the beginning of the proof-reading, using the card system. Every reference has been verified from the com- pleted book, and no pains have been spared to make this essential feature of any volume complete, comprehensive, and accurate. In conclusion, the publisher is to be con- gratulated for the clearness with which he has reproduced the photographs, and for the care and neatness displayed in the preparation of the text. Irving S. Haynes. New York, May, i8g6.

THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 519 lower border of the fourth lumbar vertebra, to the junction of the sacrum and ilium, where they divide into the external and internal iliacs. The right common iliac is slightly longer than the left (right, two inches, left one and three-quarters). They are crossed by the ureters near their bifurcation, and in the female, by the ovarian arteries. For the relation to the corresponding veins, see below. The External Iliac Arteries. Figs. 103 to 107. Continue the direction of the common iliac arteries from their termination, outward beneath Poupart's ligament, where they become the femoral. Under Poupart's ligament the external iliac artery is at a point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis. A line drawn from this point to one- half of an inch below and at the left of the umbilicus, will indicate the course of the common and external iliac arteries. The external iliac is crossed by the vas deferens in the male, the round ligament in the female, and by the deep circumflex iliac vein in both. For relations to vein, see below. Branches. (1) The deep epigastric. See page 456. Figs. 94, 103 to 107. (2) The deep circumflex iliac. Figs. 106, 107. Arises from the outside of the external iliac and takes a course outward, following the direction of Poupart's ligament and the crest of the ilium, to anastomose by its terminal branches with the iliolumbar artery. Its muscular branches perforate the transversalis muscle and ascend between this and the internal oblique muscles, supplying the abdominal wall and anastomosing with the

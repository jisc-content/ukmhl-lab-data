The phrenic nerve is formed by branches from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. The fourth is the constant branch, the fifth may be present, but the branch from the third is very inconstant. The phrenic descends obliquely across the front of the scalenus anticus muscle, passes between the subclavian artery and vein, and enters the chest over the front of the internal mammary artery. See thorax for rest of course. Scalenus Anticus. Fig. 18. Origin.—From the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical ver- tebrae. htsertion.—Into the scalene tubercle upon the upper sur- face and inner border of the first rib. Nerve Supply,—From the anterior divisions of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical nerves close to the intervertebral foramina. Action.—Both muscles, acting from below, will flex the neck ; one acting, will rotate the neck to the opposite side and flex the neck laterally. Acting from above, the mus- cles will raise and fix the first rib, so aiding in inspiration. Scalenus Medius. Fig. 18. Origin.—From the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebrae (sometimes the atlas also). Insertion,—Into the upper surface of the first rib between the subclavian groove and the tuberosity. Nerve Stipply.—The branches from the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves.

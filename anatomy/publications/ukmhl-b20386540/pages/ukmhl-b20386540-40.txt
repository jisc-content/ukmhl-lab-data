40 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, The Falx Cerebelli. Fig. lo. This is the small ridge of dura placed between the two lobes of the cerebellum and extending from the under sur- face of the tentorium in the middle line to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum. The Straight Sinus. Diags. i and 2. This will be found by slitting up the attachment of the falx cerebri to the tentorium. It is contained or formed by the diverging halves of the falx at its tentorial at- tachment. It extends from the anterior (free) margin of the tentorium, where it receives the inferior longitudinal sinus and the vein of Galen, backward to end in the torcular Herophili, or be continued into one of the lateral (usually the left) sinuses. The Lateral Sinuses. Diags. I and 2. Fig. lo. These run in the attached margins of the tentorium from the inter- nal occipital protuber- ance behind to the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where they turn down- ward through the sigmoid groove of the temporal bone to pass through the posterior compartment of the jugular fora- men and terminate in the internal jugular vein, q. v,^ page 92.

129 THE HEAD AND NECK, POSTERIOR. The Deep Cervical Fascia. This fascia is described at page 136. DISSECTION. Remove the superficial and deep fasciae, exposing the trapezius muscle, the occipital artery, vein, and the cutaneous nerves, the larger of which are the internal cutaneous branch of the third cervical nerve, the great occipital, and the small occipital (already found on the dissection of the anterior of the neck, see page 75). Trapezius Muscle, see page 362. The Cutaneous Nerves. (1) The small occipital, described on page 90. (2) The great occipital. Figs. 76 and 77. The great occipital nerve is the internal branch of the posterior division of the second cervical nerve. The ex- ternal branch of this division is a small nerve which sup- plies the inferior oblique, complexus, and trachelomastoid. The internal branch passes upward and inward and back- ward across the lower border of the inferior oblique, then through the complexus at its middle and inner thirds, and about one inch below the superior line of the occipital bone, then it pierces the trapezius close to this curved ridge and spreads out into branches, which accompany the branches of the occipital artery and supply the greater part of the back of the head. The great occipital communicates be- neath the complexus muscle with the cervical nerves above and below, forming a loose plexus called the posterior cervi- cal plexus of Cruveilheir, and upon the back of the head with the small and third occipital nerves. (3) The third occipital nerve. This is the internal branch of the posterior division of the third cervical nerve. It is much smaller than the great occipital, and takes a course below and internal to that nerve, passing through the complexus (biventer), and, emerging at the inner 9

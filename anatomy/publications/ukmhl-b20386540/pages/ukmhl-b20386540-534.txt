A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 532 abdominal ring behind the cord (or round Hgament), to be distributed to the integument over the upper and inner part of the thigh and outer surface of the scrotum or labium majus. (3) The genitocrural, from the first and second lumbar nerves. This nerve appears at the inner side of the psoas, runs downward upon its anterior surface, and divides just above Poupart's ligament into the genital and crural branches. The genital branch turns outward to join the cord and leave the abdomen through the internal abdominal ring to supply the cremaster muscle (in the female the round Hga- ment). The crural branch continues downward under Poupart's ligament at the outer side of and in front of the ex- ternal iliac and femoral arteries, pierces the fascia lata at the lower border of the saphenous opening (two inches below Poupart's Hgament), and supplies the central and upper region of the front of the thigh. (4) The external cutaneous. From the second and third nerves. Emerges from the outer border of the psoas mus- cle, below the crest of the ilium, extends outward and downward across the iHacus muscle, passes under Poupart's ligament close to the anterior superior iliac spine, in front of the origin of the sartorius, descends vertically in a canal in the fascia lata for four or five inches, then becomes superficial and suppHes the integument over the anterior and outer surfaces of the thigh, nearly to the knee. Just after coming out from under Poupart's Hgament, a branch is given off that turns backward to supply the skin over the great trochanter. (5) The anterior crural nerve. Formed from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. Descends in the interval between the psoas and iliacus muscles, being covered by

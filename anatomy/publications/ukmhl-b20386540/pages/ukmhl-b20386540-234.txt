232 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, pineal gland and the pulvinar, is a shallow depression termed the trig-onum habenulse. The optic thalami are joined by two connecting bundles of fibres,â€”the middle, gray or soft commissure, which unites them at the middle of their opposing surfaces, and the posterior commissure, which unites these surfaces be- neath the pineal gland and over the beginning of the aque- duct of Sylvius. The Development of the Corpus Striatum, Optic Thal- amus, and Internal Capsule. The optic thalamus and the corpus striatum are devel- oped from the floor (the former) and the floor and side wall (the latter) of the fore and interbrains opposite and posterior to the narrowing orifice which connects the cavity of the fore and interbrains (/. e., the future foramen of Monro). They first appear as separate swellings distinct from each other and from the wall of the vesicle, but later the corpus striatum becomes fused along its line of con- tact with the vesicular wall and also to the optic thalamus along their opposing surfaces. See page 173. At this early stage the corpus striatum does not show the nuclei that distinguish it in the adult. They (the cau- date and lenticular nuclei) are developed later as masses of gray cells which are bunched together in the supero- internal and infero-external regions of the corpus striatum. From these cells and from the cortical wall (with which the corpus striatum has now become fused), white fibres develop which pass downward and inward, separating the two portions (caudate and lenticular) from each other (except at their extreme anterior and inferior parts), and also separating the corpus striatum from the optic thala- mus. This white layer of fibres is the internal capsule.

A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 242 The crura cerebri, quadrigeminal lamina and bodies, and lower arm of the optic tract are developed from the primi- tive midbrain, and the aqueduct of Sylvius is the remains of the cavity within this vesicle. The Cerebellum. Figs. 29, 34, 37 to 40, 52 to 56. This consists of two symmetrical halves united at their opposing surfaces along a posterior median plane, and also, like the cerebral hemispheres, by a wide cross-band of commissural fibres which passes anterior to the back- ward prolongation of the crura cerebri, and is called the pons. The Lobes of the Cerebellum.—In descriptive an- atomy an astounding variety of names are applied to the various parts of each lobe ; it would be an essential gain if at least three-fourths of these names could be discarded." (Minot's Embryology.") The cerebellum is divided into five primary lobes by four sulci. The superior surface of the cerebellum is divided into two lobes, the quadrate and the posterosuperior. The former is subdivided into the anterior and posterior crescen- tic portions. The under surface of the cerebellum presents the floccu- lus, a small but prominent rounded lobe close to the pos- terior part of the pons. Behind this and close to the medulla, the tonsillar or amygdaloid lobe. Behind these are the cuneate, slender, and postero-inferior lobes. Between the under surfaces of the cerebellar hemispheres is a deep notch—the vallecula—for the reception of the medulla. The junction of the cerebellar lobes along the median plane is marked by a rounded elevation called the superior and the inferior vermis. These are further subdivided by

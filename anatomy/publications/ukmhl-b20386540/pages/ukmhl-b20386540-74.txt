A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 74 The posterior branch is joined by the posterior auricular vein, and the trunk thus formed is the external jugular vein. The external jugular descends vertically, crosses the sternomastoid (obliquely), pierces the deep cervical fascia behind the middle of the clavicle, and empties into the subclavian vein. In its course it receives from the rear the posterior exter- nal jugular, the superficial transverse cervical, the supra- scapular ; from the front, a communicating vein from the facial, internal, and (sometimes) anterior jugular veins. The Posterior External Jugular.—This vein drains the blood from the upper and back part of the neck. It opens into the external jugular at the posterior margin of the sternomastoid muscle. The Anterior Jugular.—This is formed under the chin close to the median line by the union of several small veins. Its course is downward until near the sternal end of the clavicle, when it pierces the deep fascia, turns outward under the sternomastoid, and empties into the external jugular close to its termination, or into the subclavian vein. It is connected by branches, varying in size, with the facial, external, and opposite anterior jugular veins. The Facial Vein in the Neck.—^Just below the neck this vein is joined by the anterior division of the temporo- maxillary sinus ; it gives off the anastomotic vein to the anterior jugular, and then empties into the internal jugular at the level of the hyoid bone.

42 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The right lateral sinus usually receives the superior longitudinal sinus; while the left receives the straight sinus, and the two are connected by a short sinus across the internal occipital protuberance. In other cases the four sinuses open into a common cavity termed the torcular Herophiliâ€”or the confluence of sinuses. The lateral sinuses also receive the veins from the posterior part of the cerebrum, the upper and lower surfaces of the cerebellum, from the diploe, also the su- perior petrosal sinuses. They communicate with external veins through the mastoid and posterior condyloid fora- mina. The Superior Petrosal Sinus. Diags. i and 2. Two in number, one on either side. This sinus is located in a groove along the upper margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone (the tentorium being attached to the margins of the groove). Externally it opens into the lateral sinus, and internally into the cavernous sinus. The Occipital Sinus. Diags. i and 2. Is formed by the junction of the marginal sinuses at the posterior part of the foramen magnum. It extends upward in the median line to open into the confluence of sinuses over the internal occipital crest. The marginal sinuses communicate in front with the lateral sinuses. The Inferior Petrosal Sinus. (A paired sinus.) Diags. i and 2. It extends backward from the cavernous sinus, at the margin of the basilar process of the occipital bone, to leave the skull through the anterior compartment in the jugular foramen, and below the margin of the foramen helps to form the internal jugular vein by joining with the lateral sinus.

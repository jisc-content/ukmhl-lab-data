353 THE THORAX. similar one from the left coronary artery. The other, the interventricular, descends in the posterior (right) interven- tricular groove to the apex of the heart to enter into an anastomosis with the left artery. The right artery also gives off several other branches to the front and side of the heart (right auricle). The Left Coronary Artery. Figs. 70, 71, 72. Is given off from the left (posterior) sinus of Valsalva, issues between the left auricle and the pulmonary artery, curves downward in the left interventricular groove to the apex of the heart to form a free anastomosis with the right artery. It gives off a branch which turns backward in the auriculoventricular groove to anastomose with the similar branch of the right. Both arteries supply the auricles and beginning of the great vessels. The Cardiac Veins. Figs. 70, 71, 72, 73. They take up the blood from the area of the heart sup- plied by the above arteries, which they accompany. The coronary sinus extends from the anterior interventri- cular vein (of which it is a continuation) around the left margin of the heart to the right auricle. Near the auricle it receives the right (posterior) interventricular vein. The anterior interventidcular (great cardiac) vein follows upward in the sulcus with the left artery, it reaches the auriculoventricular groove, turns backward in it to the right auricle, into which it empties. The portion of the vein in the auriculoventricular groove is called the coronary sinus ; it is about an inch long, and receives the oblique vein of Marshall, posterior cardiac veins, and the posterior inter- ventricular vein (accompanies the right coronary artery), the last just before it enters the auricle. 23

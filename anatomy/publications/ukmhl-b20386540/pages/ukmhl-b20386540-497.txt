THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 495 margin of the liver, on the left by the margin of the costal cartilages, and below by the upper horizontal line. See page 435. Behind, the posterior surface of the stomach helps to form part of the anterior wall of the cavity of the great omentum (lesser peritoneum). It lies in front of the pan- creas, great vessels, crura of diaphragm, solar plexus, from all of which it is separated by the anterior layer of the transverse mesocolon, also in front of the spleen and the gastrosplenic omentum, the splenic artery, left kidney and suprarenal body. Above, are the liver, gastrohepatic omentum, diaphragm, and oesophagus. Below, the gastro- colic or greater omentum, transverse colon and its meso- colon. The Surface Area of the Stomach Projection,â€”The stomach being one of the most movable organs by reason of its loose peritoneal connections and from the varying states of dis- tention or emptiness, it follows that to attempt to give any fixed outlines of its position is almost useless. The cardiac end is the only point that can be fixed with any degree of exactness. This lies behind the seventh costal cartilage, one inch to the left of the sternum. The fundus rises up behind and above the location of the apex of the heart, to the level of the sixth costochondral articulation. The pylorus is the most uncertain portion ; usually it is found one inch to the right of the median line and two inches below the ensiform. The upper border will be indicated by a short curve, with concavity upward, connecting the cardiac and pyloric ori- fices. The greater curvature is drawn upward from the cardia to the point reached by the fundus, then with a wide curve is drawn outward, to the left and downward, then to the right and after crossing the middle line midway between t

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 558 extremity represented by the distribution of the internal saphenous vein (internal, anterior, and posterior area of lower extremity). The Prepatellar Bursa Will be found over the patella, between it and the deep fascia. A vertical incision will open into the bursa. DISSECTION. Remove all of the superficial fascia, leaving the vessels and nerves lying upon the fascia lata. Recognize the deep layer of the superficial fascia and its attachments, then remove it carefully and expose the saphenous opening, and vein passing through it. Save the denser, curved outer band and the thinner inner por- tion of the fascia bounding the saphenous opening. The Fascia Lata, Anterior Portion, Figs. 115, 116. This is a strong tube of membrane enclosing the thigh. Attached below to the bony points about the knee—con- dyles of femur, patella, tuberosities of tibia, head of the fibula. Above, anteriorly, Poupart's ligament, spine, crest, and front of the pubes (iliac portion). The pubic portion is under the iliac portion and is attached to the iliopectineal line, and externally blends with the ihac fascia from the pelvis. (See page 525.) Internally, to the rami of the pubes and ischium. Posteriorly, see page 600. {a) Intermuscular Septa.—A strong one is found ex- ternally between the vastus and the biceps muscles attached to the external lip of the linea aspera. A less distinct septum is found in front of the adductor muscles, and a third one behind them. From the under surface of the fascia lata there also extend off processes to enclose all the muscles of the thigh in separate compartments. (U) The Iliotibial Baiid.—This is a reinforcement of the transverse fibres of the fascia lata along the outer side of

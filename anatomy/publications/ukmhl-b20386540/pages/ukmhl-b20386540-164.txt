The cortical arteries are distributed as follows :— (a) The first supplies the inferior frontal convolution. This is called Broca's artery, supplying that convolution. Its obstruction in the left side produces degeneration of the inferior frontal convolution, which is manifested by disorders of speech. {U) The second supplies the lower two-thirds of the ascending frontal convolution, (c) The third is distributed to the ascending parietal convolution. (<f) The fourth, to the supramarginal, angular, and first temporal convolutions. (3) The posterior cerebral. After giving off the posterior lateral ganglionic arteries the posterior cerebral divides into three sets of branches, which are distributed to the under and lower part of the temporal lobe and the lower, inner, and outer surfaces of the occipital lobe. The Branches of the Basilar Artery.—The formation, course, and ending of the basilar are given on page 158. (a) The transverse branches supply the pons, {b) One of these transverse branches follows the auditory nerve into the internal auditory meatus and is termed the auditory artery, (c) Another, a large branch, supplies the anterior part of the under surface of the cerebellum, and is called the inferior cerebellar artery, {d^ The superior cerebellar arises near the end of the basilar, courses backward and up- ward around the crus cerebri to the upper surface of the cerebellum, which it supplies, also small branches are given to the pineal gland, velum interpositum, and the valve of Vieussens.

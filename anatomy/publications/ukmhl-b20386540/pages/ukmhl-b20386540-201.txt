201 THE BRAIN. 4. The Trochlear. Figs. 21, 29, 34, 10, 11. This is found curving forward around the outer side of the crura cerebri. It enters the cavernous sinus and leaves the skull through the sphenoidal fissure. See page 50. (The deep origin of the nerve is from a nucleus in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius behind the third nucleus. The fibres of the fourth nerve decussate across the valve of Vieussens, then proceed on their way around the crura cerebri.) 5. The Trig^eminus. Figs. 21, 29, 53, 10, 11, 12. The superficial origin of this nerve is from the side of the pons in two bundles, a larger anterior (sensory) and a smaller posterior (motor). These bundles pass forward over the inner end of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and upon the front surface of the petrous bone the sensory root terminates in the Gasserian ganglion while the motor root passes beneath the ganglion to the foramen ovale. See page 46. (The deep origin of the fifth nerve is from three sets of nuclei; one in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius, from which comes the descending* root; a middle from the floor of the fourth ventricle, from which arises the middle root; and a third nucleus from the upper part of the cervical division of the spinal cord, from which arises the ascending root. The descending root is sensory and trophic, the middle motor and sensory, and the ascending sensory.) Ophthalmic division see page 54. Superior maxillary divi- sion see page 149. Inferior maxillary division see page 117. 6. The Abducens. Figs. 29, 10, 11. The superficial origin is in the groove between the pons and medulla, and from between the olivary body and the anterior pyramids of the latter. The nerve continues for-

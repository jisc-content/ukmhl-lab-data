The cavity within the hind and the afterbrains dilates to form the fourth ventricle. The Formation of Fissures.â€”As the forebrain increases in size and enlarges upward and backward there is left be- tween the two halves a deep fissure, which is the great longitudinal fissure of the adult. As the forebrain enlarges it extends backward, so as to overhang the rest of the brain, and the interval thus left between the forebrain and the other parts of the brain becomes the transverse fissure (of Bichat) in the adult. The above constitutes one method of formation of the fissures of the brain. Another method is by the involution of the entire thickness of the cerebral surface itself. To this second classification belong the fissures of Sylvius, parieto-occipital, calcarine, and hippocampal. A third class of fissures is formed by the tmequal growth of the outer layers of the cerebral surface. The most important one of these is called the fissure of Rolando. To these depressions the name of sulci is applied in dis- tinction to those grooves formed between parts of the brain, or by the involution of the entire thickness of the brain wall, which are called fissures. The formation of the fissure of Sylvius is taken as an example of the method by which the second class of fissures is formed. At the second month the foetal brain (forebrain) pre- sents a smooth surface, but beginning with this period there appears upon the middle of its outer lower surface a depression.

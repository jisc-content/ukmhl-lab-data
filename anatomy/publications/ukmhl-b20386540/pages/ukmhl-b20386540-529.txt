THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 527 front of the vertebrae, the right behind the vena cava, the left behind the outer border of the aorta, both close to the anterior border of the psoas muscle. The cord passing to the sacral ganglia goes behind the iliac vessels, internal to the psoas muscle. The Receptaculum Chyli. This is the dilated pouch from which the thoracic duct arises. It receives the lymph and chyle from the abdomi- nal walls and organs. See page 344. It lies to the right and behind the abdominal aorta, be- tween it and the right crus of the diaphragm, and upon the body of the second lumbar vertebrae. It is one and one- half inches long and one-quarter of an inch in diameter. Psoas Magnus. Figs. 103, 107. Origin.—By five muscular slips from the anterior surfaces and lower borders of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, from the sides and intervertebral discs of the last dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. Over the centre of the bodies of the vertebrae small gaps are left in the muscular attach- ment for the passage of the lumbar vessels and lumbar branches of the sympathetic nerves. Insertion.—By a strong tendon into the lesser trochanter of the femur. Nerve Supply.—Muscular branches from the anterior division of the second and third lumbar nerves. Action.—For action on femur see under Iliacus. On the spine it flexes the last dorsal and lumbar vertebrae upon the pelvis. Iliacus. Figs. 103, 107. Origin.—From the base of the sacrum, the sacro-iliac and iliolumbar ligaments, the ihac fossa, the iliac crest,

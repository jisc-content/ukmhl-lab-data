A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 288 (usually) by uniting with the articular branch of the su- perior profunda to form an arch above the olecranon fossa. The veins. These are venae comites, accompanying the arteries above and opening into the brachial veins. The Nerves. Figs. 63, 64, 65. (1) The musculocutaneous nerve. This is the direct continuation of the outer cord of the brachial plexus. It passes through the coracobrachialis muscle, then between the biceps and brachialis anticus ; appearing at the outer border of the tendon of the biceps, it pierces the deep fascia over the elbow and becomes the cutaneous nerve to the outer side of the front of the arm. In its course through the arm the musculocutaneous supplies the coracobrachialis, biceps, and brachialis anticus. (2) The median nerve is formed by a branch from the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus, which unite at the outer side of the axillary artery ; the nerve passes down the arm to reach the inner side of the brachial artery in front of the elbow, having crossed the middle of the artery in front or behind it. The median nerve has no branches in the arm, but just above the bend of the elbow it gives off the articular branch to the joint. (3) The ulnar nerve continues the inner cord down the inside of the arm, is joined by the inferior profunda artery about its middle, and disappears behind the internal condyle. An articular branch is furnished to the elbow-joint behind the condyle. (4) The internal cutaneous. This comes from the inter- nal cord, descends along the inner side of the arm, pierces the deep fascia above the elbow, divides into an anterior and posterior branch. The anterior continues down the

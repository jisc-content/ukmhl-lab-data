A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 416 The Corpora Cavernosa. Figs. 82, 83. Each corpus consists of a cylindrical tube of dense fas- cia (tunica albuginea) containing erectile tissue. It is pointed at both ends, the anterior being short and imbedded in the substance of the glans, the posterior longer, more slender, and tapering, and being attached firmly to the inner margin of the ramus of the pubes and ischium. This por- tion of the corpus cavernosum is called the crus penis. The artery of the crus enters it close to its bony attach- ment, and runs through its centre to the anterior extremity, giving off in its course numerous branches to the erectile tissue. The vein of the crus emerges where the artery enters, and is continued posteriorly under the name of the Internal Pudic Veiit^ q. v., page 413. The two crura are separated below, where they are fastened to the pubic arch, and at their anterior extremity, where they terminate in the glans, but the intervening portion is firmly united by an envelope of fascia in addition to their own proper sheaths. When the crura are cut apart the line of division shows numerous transverse striations, called the septum pec- tiniforme. Anterior Portiojt of the Triangular Ligament. See page 403. DISSECTION. Remove what is left of the anterior layer of the triangular ligament. Ex- pose the compressor urethrse, Cowper's glands, the deeper branches of the internal pudic artery and nerve.

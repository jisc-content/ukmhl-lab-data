50 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Lachrymal Gland, Nerve, and Artery. Fig. ii. The lachrymal gland is a small gland lying at the ante- rior, outer, and upper part of the socket of the eye. Its capsule is formed by an extension from the orbital fascia (see above), by which the gland is retained in place. The several small ducts open at the outer, upper part of the conjunctiva of the eye. The lachiymal nerve enters the orbit through the external angle of the sphenoidal fissure. It is accompanied by the lachryjnal artery from the ophthalmic, and both run along the upper border of the external rectus muscle to the lach- rymal gland. Levator Palpebrae Superioris. Origin.—Above and in front of the optic foramen. Insertion.—Into the tarsus of the upper eye-lid. Nerve Supply.-—Third cranial nerve. Action.—To raise the upper eye-lid. Superior Oblique. Origin.—In front of the inner margin of the optic foramen. Insertion.—Into the outer surface of the eye-ball. Nerve Supply.—The fourth cranial nerve. Action.—Alone, to move the eye downward and outward. The pulley for the superior oblique is a ring of fibrous tissue attached to the anterior, inner, and superior portion of the orbit cavity through which passes the tendon of the superior oblique muscle. The Fourth Cranial Nerve. Fig. II. Diags. 3 and 4. This comes through the sphenoidal fissure, lying at the inner and superior angle, and proceeds to the superior oblique, which it supplies. In its course it crosses above the origin of the levator palpebrae.

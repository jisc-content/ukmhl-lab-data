THE HEAD AND NECK, POSTERIOR. 139 It also extends downward to the cartilage of the first rib, this portion forming the loop by which the tendon and posterior belly of the omohyoid muscle is kept in position. Between layers number one and two is left a triangular space—Burns' space—that has no width above, but below is represented by the space between the posterior margins of the sternomastoid. This space contains fat, lymphatic glands, the anterior jugular vein, and connective tissue to keep them in position. It is also stated that the second layer is continued under the clavicle, splits to enclose the subclavius muscle, and reunites to form the costocoracoid membrane. That the sheath for the subclavian vein is derived from this second layer, while for the artery it comes, as stated below, from the third layer. (3) The third layer of the cervical fascia. This invests the carotid vessels, arteries, and internal jugular vein, pneu- mogastric nerve, thyroid gland, trachea, oesophagus, and many other structures. This is also given off from the under surface of the first layer behind the sternomastoid muscle. It passes forward, splitting to enclose the internal jugular vein, pneumogastric nerve, carotid arteries (forming their sheaths), thyroid gland (forming its capsule), the trachea, and oesophagus, and finally unites in the middle line with corresponding layers from the other side. Besides the structures above enumerated this layer en- sheaths all the structures found between the under surface of the second layer and in front of the prevertebral (fourth) layer. Above, this third layer passes up to the base of the skull and is attached to the basilar and jugular processes of the occipital bone, the petrous process of the temporal bone, the spinous and pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone.

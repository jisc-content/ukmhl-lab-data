THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 561 is a somewhat thickened band extending from the spine of the pubes and the inner part of Poupart's ligament, out- ward and downward under the saphenous vein to blend with the pubic portion on the inner side of the opening. This curved free border of the iliac portion of the fascia lata is the falciform lig'ament or process. There is no band on the inner side of the opening as on the outer, because the sheet of fascia (pubic portion) ex- tends upward and outward, under, behind the femoral ves- sels, forming an almost level plane of fascia with which the falciform process blends at its lower portion. This pubic portion of the fascia lata helps to form the posterior cover- ing for the femoral vessels. The opening is covered over by the deep layer of the superficial fascia, Avhich is firmly attached to the falciform process (outer and lower margin of the opening) and but slightly to the pubic or inner mar- gin of the fascia lata. This firm attachment of the cribriform fascia to the outer and lower margin of the opening and its loose attachment to the pubic portion explains (at least partially) why a femoral hernia takes an upward and inward course as soon as it leaves the saphenous opening. This covering to the saphenous opening is called the cribriform fascia, because it is perforated by the internal saphenous vein, superficial external pudic and superficial epigastric arteries, and (sometimes) the genitocrural nerve. The External Cutaneous Nerve. Fig. 115. This will be found as it issues from under Poupart's liga- ment close to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. Its course is downward along the outer side of the thigh, in a canal formed by the fascia lata, for four or five inches, it then becomes superficial and supplies the integument of the 36

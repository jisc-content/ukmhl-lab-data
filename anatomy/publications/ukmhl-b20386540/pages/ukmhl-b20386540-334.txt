332 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. The dissection of the heart, see page 354. The Pulmonary Artery. Figs. 57, 58, 70 to 73. Diag. 22. Conveys the venous blood from the right heart to the lungs. It is about two inches long, and is contained within the pericardium, and ends by dividing into two terminal branches, which pass through the pericardium. It presents in the interval between the two auricles, curves upward, to the left, and backward beneath the aortic arch, to which it is attached by the obliterated ductus arteriosus (remains of the foetal communication between the pulmonary artery and the aorta), where it divides into its two terminal branches. Relations.—At the beginning it is between the two auri- cles, and has the ascending aorta behind and to the right. The coronary arteries are on either side of it. It is covered by the pericardium. At its termination it lies beneath the aortic arch, to the left of the ascending aorta, and over the left auricle, and is covered by pericardium on the left. (See page 352 for dissection.) The Ductus Arteriosus. Fig. 72. This is the fibrous cord in the adult which is found joining the under surface of the transverse aorta to the upper surface of the pulmonary artery. In the foetus it was relatively a large trunk and conducted the blood from the pulmonary artery into the aorta. The Rig"ht Pulmonary Artery. Is longer than the left, passes to the right lung, where it divides into three main branches to the three lobes. Relations.—In front, ascending aorta, superior vena cava, phrenic nerve, and anterior pulmonary plexus of nerves ;

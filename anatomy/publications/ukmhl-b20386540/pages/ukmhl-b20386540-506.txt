504 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, with a sort of sphincter, formed by an increase in the circular fibres, and a narrowing m the calibre of the bowel. The omega loop lies normally within the pelvic cavity. The loop has a distinct mesentery and is freely movable, being sur- rounded almost entirely by peritoneum. The attachment of the omega mesentery crosses the psoas at right angles, the iliac vessels at their bifurcation, and curves downward into the pelvis toward the right so as to reach the median line. This line of attachment meas- ures about three and one-half inches, and the mesentery is about the same in width. Relatio?is.â€”With the small intestines in front and to the inner side. With the csecum and vermiform appendix (if distended) on the right. With the iliacus and psoas, genito- crural nerve, iliac vessels, first portion of sacrum behind. Below it rests upon the bladder and rectum and in the female, upon the uterus. The rectum (Figs, iio, iii), is the last portion of the large intestine from the end of the omega loop at the third portion of the sacrum to the anus, and measures about five inches. It may conveniently be described in two por- tions. The first portion three and one-half inches, from the third portion of the sacrum to the tip of the coccyx. This part of the rectum is covered by peritoneum only upon its front and at the very beginning. In front of this portion are the bladder, seminal vesicle, trigone, posterior surface of the prostate. In the female, with the posterior surface of the cervix of the uterus and upper part of the vagina. Behind, it rests upon the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx conforming to the sacral curve. The peritoneum is reflected from the rectum to the bladder or the vagina, and in the bottom of this reflection is the rectovesical or rectovaginal fossa.

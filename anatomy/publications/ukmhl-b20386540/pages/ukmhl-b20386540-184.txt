A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 184 angle, opening forward, of about 71 degrees, with the longitudinal fissure. The course of the fissure is not perfectly straight but winding, and may be divided into three segments or thirds ; these segments make with each other angles or bends (genua) ; the angle formed between the upper and middle thirds points backward, that formed by the middle and Jower thirds points forward (superior and inferior genu). Fig. 26. The fissure of Rolando separates the frontal (anterior) from the parietal (posterior) lobe. The Parieto-occipital Fissure. Figs. 26, 27. As this shows only slightly upon the outer surface of the cerebrum its description will be omitted until the inner surface of a hemisphere is described. Suffice to say that its external portion is very short (one-half of an inch) and is found midway between the fissure of Rolando and the apex of the hemisphere behind, and partially divides the parietal from the occipital lobe. The Frontal Lobe. Figs. 23, 24, 26. The frontal lobe is situated at the anterior part of the cerebrum. It was thought to correspond to the limits of the frontal bone—hence its name—but such is not the case, as the lobe reaches backward beneath the anterior third of the parietal bone. The frontal lobe presents three surfaces, the external, internal, and inferior; these are also called the frontal, mesial, and orbital. The external surface of the lobe is cut off from the rest of the cerebrum by the fissure of Rolando behind and the fissure of Sylvius below. The inferior surface rests upon the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The internal surface is separated from the corres-

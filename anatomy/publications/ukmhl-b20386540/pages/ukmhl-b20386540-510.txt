508 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, with the superior mesenteric vein behind the pancreas and form the portal vein. The nerve supply is from the solar plexus. The Pancreas. Fig. 105. The pancreas is an elongated gland with its larger ex- tremity (the head), within the duodenal arch, its body (the middle portion) crosses the spine over the first lumbar ver- tebra, and the smaller extremity (or the tail) is in contact with the spleen. Relations.â€”The gland lies behind the peritoneum, which forms the anterior layer of the transverse mesocolon, by which the gland is separated from the stomach. Behind, crura of the diaphragm, vena cava, aorta, superior mesen- teric artery and vein, spine, left kidney and suprarenal body. Above, the upper border rests against the coeliac axis and has the splenic artery and vein running behind it. Below, the third part of the duodenum. The duct of the gland opens into the common bile duct close to the duodenum ; it is called the duct of Wirsung". The blood-supply: From the splenic, hepatic, and superior mesenteric arteries. The return flow is through the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. The lymphatics empty into the superior mesenteric glands. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus and accom- pany the arteries to the gland. DISSECTION. Raise the liver and ribs as far upward as possible with chain hooks. Draw the stomach downward. Dissect off the peritoneum covering the hepatic artery, duct, and portal vein, trace the artery to the coeliac axis, and the gas- tric and splenic branches of the same.

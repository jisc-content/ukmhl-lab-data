The posterior cerebral arteries pass outward and then backward around the crura cerebri and supply the inner and under surface of the occipital and temporal lobes. The middle and posterior cerebrals are joined together in front of the crura cerebri by the posterior communicat- ing' arteries. These are usually small vessels ; one may be

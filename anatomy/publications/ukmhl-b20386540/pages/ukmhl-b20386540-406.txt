404 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. the ischium and pubes external to the line of the deep fascia. Behind, it is continuous with the deep layer ; in front, it extends to the subpubic ligament and is pierced here for the dorsal vein, arteries, and nerves of the penis. It is separated from the deep layer by the compressor urethrae muscle, imbedded in which are the dorsal nerve and vein of the penis, the internal pudic artery and its branches to the bulb, the crus, and the dorsal artery of the penis, as well as the Cowper's glands and the membra- nous urethra. It is pierced by the membranous urethra, the ducts of Cowper's glands, the artery of the bulb, the dorsal artery, vein, and nerve of the penis. DISSECTION. Fill the rectum with oakum and take two or three stitches in the anus. Incisions.—(l) In the median line from the perineoscrotal junction (base of the scrotum) to the tip of the coccyx, cutting close to the anus upon either side. (2) Make an incision at the anterior and posterior end of No. i, about three inches transversely outward toward the right and left. Do not cut across the base of these flaps, nor make any other transverse incisions. Reflect the integument in the form of two large flaps. In doing so be care- ful not to cut away the external sphincter of the anus, which lies close to the skin. Notice that while the skin is thick in the other parts of the perineum, about the anus it is very thin, and puckered into radiating lines by the contrac- tion of the external sphincter. The Superficial Fascia. Diag. 28. This consists of two layers :— {ci) A subcutaneous layer which varies in thickness ac- cording to the amount of adipose tissue present. When this is carefully scraped away a well-marked but thin layer of fascia is seen covering the deeper parts. This is the second layer of the superficial fascia, and is called the peri- neal fascia, or fascia of Colles. {U) The perineal fascia, fascia of Colles, the deep

608 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. Nerve Supply.—A branch from the sacral plexus, see page 612. Action.—To rotate the thigh outward and adduct it when the limb is extended. If the thigh is flexed it acts as an external rotator and abductor of it. Acting from the femur, it will depress the opposite side of the pelvis and carry it backward. Obturator Bxternus. See page 582. Biceps Flexor Cruris (Femoris) {Biceps Femoris). Origin.—(1) The long head, in common with the semi- tendinosus from the (anterior) lower and internal facet upon the tuberosity of the ischium. (2) The short head, from the whole length of the external lip of the linea aspera and the upper two-thirds of the external condyloid ridge, and from the external intermuscular septum. hisertion.—Into the head of the fibula at the base of the styloid process, by a prolongation of some of the anterior fibres of the tendon into the external tuberosity of the tibia, and by others from the back of the tendon into the deep fascia of the leg. Nerve Supply.—The great sciatic (from the first, second, and third sacral nerves). Action.—(i) Upon the leg (both heads) the biceps is a flexor of the leg, and in a flexed position becomes an ex- ternal rotator (supinator). (2) Upon the thigh (the long head) the muscle is an extensor for all the ordinary pur- poses of locomotion and the like, the gluteus maximus being only called into action by some heavier work to be done. It also has a slight action as an external rotator of the thigh. (3) Upon the body, it is used in raising it from a stooping position (an extensor of the pelvis).

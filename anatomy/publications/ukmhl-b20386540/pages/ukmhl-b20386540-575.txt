THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 573 crest of the ilium. In its course it gives off twigs to the iliacus, sartorius muscles, and the inguinal lymphatic glands. (3) The superficial (superior) external pudic arises from the inner side of the femoral, passes through the fascia lata or the saphenous opening, extends upward and inward to the lower part of the abdomen, where it meets its fellow from the other side. As it is opposite the side of the root of the penis it gives off the superficial dorsal artery to that organ. (4) The deep (inferior) external pudic.—A branch in common with the above, or just below it, from the inner side of the femoral. It takes a course inward across the pectineus and adductor longus muscles (to which it gives muscular branches) passes through the fascia lata at the inner border of the adductor longus, breaks up into branches which supply the scrotum (labium in the female) and the inner side of the thigh. (5) The deep femoral. Seepage 579. (6) The anastomotica magna.—This artery is given off from the femoral just before it turns backward through the femoral opening, at the lower end of Hunter's canal. It divides into two branches, the superficial and deep. The former takes a superficial course along with the long or internal saphenous nerve to the inner side of the knee, while the latter, the deep branch, takes a deeper course through the fibres of the vastus internus muscle in front of the tendon of the adductor magnus to the deeper parts about the knee. Both of these arteries enter into an an- astomosis with the internal articular branches from the popliteal ; the superficial with the inferior, and the deep with the superior, internal articular branches. (7) The muscular branches.—These are small branches,

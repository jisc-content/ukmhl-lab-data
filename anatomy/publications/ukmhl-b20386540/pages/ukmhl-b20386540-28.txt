Its course is between the internal lateral ligament and neck of the lower jaw, then between the temporomaxillary articulation and the parotid gland ; issuing from under the gland, it turns upward along with the temporal artery, be- hind which it runs to supply the integument upon the side of the head. Its branches are, also, distributed to the temporomaxil- lary articulation, the parotid gland, and the ear (meatus and upper part of the pinna). DISSECTION. Incision.—I. Continue the median incision to the point of the chin, carry- ing it around the wing of the nose and the angle of the mouth. 2. From the last point extend a cut backward along the lower border, to the angle of the jaw and upward to the lobe of the ear. Reflect the flap from before backward. Much care will have to be exer- cised in removing the integument from the face, as it is very thin, especially so over the eyelids, and closely attached to the facial muscles, which are thin, pale, and indistinct. Orbicularis Palpebrarum. Fig. 2. Origin.—The palpebral portion, by means of the internal tarsal ligament (tendo-oculi) from the crest of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. The orbital portion, from the internal tarsal hgament, the nasal process of the superior maxilla, and the inner portion of the infra-orbital arch. Insertion.—The palpebral portion, into the external tarsal ligament and by it into the front of the frontal portion of the malar bone. The orbital portion surrounds the palpebral or central portion and forms the sphincter muscle of the eyelids. Insertion same as the origin.

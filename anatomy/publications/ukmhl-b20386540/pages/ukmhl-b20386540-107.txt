THE NECK, ANTERIOR. 107 It furnishes filaments to the thyroid gland and gives off the middle cardiac nerve, which passes into the thorax to end in the deep cardiac plexus., and is connected to the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. The Inferior Cervical G-anglion. This ganglion lies behind the vertebral artery, and be- tween the neck of the first rib and the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. Its filaments extend to the seventh and eighth cervical nerves, to the vertebral artery, and by the inferior cardiac nerve to the deep cardiac plexus. DISSECTION. Divide the internal carotid near its bifurcation and retract the two portions. Ligate the subclavian vein at the clavicle (if the axillary has already been tied, then draw the vein under the clavicle) and turn it inward. Keep track of the thoracic duct on the left side. Divide the scalenus anticus over the subclavian artery and clean the entire course (in the neck) of the artery and its branches. The Rig'ht Lymphatic Duct. Receives the lymphatics of the right side of the head and neck, right upper extremity, right side of the thorax, and from the convex surface of the liver. It is about an inch long and empties into the angle between the internal jugular and subclavian as they form the right innominate vein. The Thoracic Duct.â€”See Thorax, page 344. The Subclavian Artery. Figs. 17, 18. The subclavian artery differs in its origin on the two sides of the body. On the right side it is the external branch of bifurcation of the innominate artery; on the left side, arises as the last branch from the transverse portion of the aorta.

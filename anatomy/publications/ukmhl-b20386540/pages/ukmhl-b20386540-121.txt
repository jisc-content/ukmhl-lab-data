121 THE NECK, ANTERIOR. passes upward to the Glaserian fissure, and through this to the tympanum. (3) The middle meningeal. The largest and most im- portant branch of the internal maxillary artery. It arises from the upper surface of the artery, in its situation between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament, runs upward behind the external pterygoid muscle, then between the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve, and enters the foramen spinosum in the sphenoid bone. For the course of the artery within the skull, see page 44. (4) The small meningeal. Often a branch from the middle. Follows upward the inferior dental nerve and dis- appears through the foramen ovale. It supplies the Gas- serian ganglion, the cavernous sinus, and the adjacent dura. (5) The inferior dental artery. This accompanies the nerve of the same name in its course through the inferior dental canal, and appears through the mental foramen as the mental artery. Before it enters the inferior dental canal the artery gives off a branch (Ungual) which follows the Hngual nerve, and another (the mylohyoid) which runs forward with the mylo- hyoid nerve. Pterygoid, or second portion :â€” (1) The masseteric. Reaches the deep surface of the masseter muscle through the sigmoid notch of the jaw, and in company with the corresponding nerve to the muscle. (2) The deep temporal, anterior and posterior, are dis- tributed to the under surface of the temporal muscle. They and the deep temporal nerves will be found together. (3) The buccal. Follows the buccal nerve downward and forward to supply the buccinator muscle and the skin and mucous membrane of the cheek.

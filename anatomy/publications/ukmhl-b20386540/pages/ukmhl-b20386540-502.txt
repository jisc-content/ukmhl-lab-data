500 A MANUAL OF AAA TO MY. The Larg'e Intestine. Figs. 96, 97, 98, lOl, 102. Reaches from the right inguinal region, upward and across the abdomen, then descends along the left side, to pass into the pelvic cavity. It has a length of five and one-half feet, and a diameter of two inches. The large intestine is not only larger than the small, but is distinguished from it by pendent masses of fat covered by peritoneumâ€”appendices epiploiccE, and by having tJiree bands of muscular tissue longitudinally disposed upon its exterior, one posteriorly at the mesenteric attachment, one anteriorly, and one internally. These bands being shorter than the bowel give it a saccidated appearajtce. Its blind extremity, below the junction of the ileum, is the caecum. The caecum lies in the right lumbar or inguinal region. It is about two and one half inches long and about three inches wide. From its lower, posterior surface the vermi- form appendix comes off, and lies usually in a direction up- vv^ard and to the left, but often the appendix may hang down into the pelvic cavity, or take any other position about the lower end of the caecum. The caecum and appendix are usu- ally entirely enclosed by peritoneum (the appendix having a distinct, though small mesentery), and are free within the abdominal cavity, consequently any pus coming from the interior of either would be discharged into the general abdominal cavity and start up a (usually) fatal peritonitis, unless the exudation is shut off by inflammatory adhesions agglutinating the adjacent intestines together, to form a local pus cavity. The point at which the appendix joins the caecum is on the ilio-umbilical line (from anterior superior spine of ilium to umbilicus) at a distance from the iliac spine of two and

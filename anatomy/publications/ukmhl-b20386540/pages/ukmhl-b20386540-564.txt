A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 562 anterior and outer surfaces of the thigh nearly to the knee. Just below the spine of the ilium it gives off a branch which turns backward to supply the integument over the great trochanter. The Internal Cutaneous Nerve. Figs. 115, 117. It descends across the femoral artery and divides into two branches : an anterior, which pierces the fascia lata at the middle and lower thirds of the thigh and supplies the integument of the inner anterior surface of the lower third of the thigh. It descends across the vessels and gives off branches which perforate the fascia lata at various levels to supply the integument of the inner surface of the thigh. The two terminal branches are described as the anterior and posterior branches. The anterior is distributed to the front of the lower third of the thigh and knee, while the posterior branch extends downward to the upper third of the back of the leg. The Middle Cutaneous Nerve. Figs. 115, 117. May exist as a single or double trunk. It (or one of the divisions) usually pierces the sartorius muscle, then the fascia lata at the upper and middle thirds of the thigh, and supplies the integument of the front and inner sides of the thigh to the knee. DISSECTION. Carefully remove the fascia lata, with the superficial vessels and nerves, from the front of the thigh ; leaving Poupart's ligament intact above ; the ilio- tibial band on the outside ; and exposing the gracilis muscle on the inside. Sartorius. Fig. 117. Origin.â€”From the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the upper part of the notch below.

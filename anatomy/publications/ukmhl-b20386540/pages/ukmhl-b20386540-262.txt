260 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 1893 with the camera (see ''Relations of the Heart and Lungs to the Anterior Chest Wall," as determined by composite photographs, published in the Medical Journal of November 11 and December 9, 1893) and by compari- son of the conflicting statements of the various authors. (1) Base of Heart,—A line crossing the sternum ob- liquely from the upper margin of the third right to the lower border of the second left costal cartilage, an inch and a half from the median line on each side. (2) Apex.—In the fifth space near the upper margin of the sixth costal cartilage, two and a half inches to the left of the median line. (3) Right Border.—From the right end of the base curved slightly outward to reach a point an inch and three- quarters from the right of the middle line over the fourth cartilage and ending at the centre of the fifth cartilage an inch from the mid-sternal line. (4) Left Border.—From the left end of the base with a con- vexity outward to the apex. It reaches its greatest distance (three inches) from the sternal centre over the fourth space. (5) Lower Border.—A line curved downward at its beginning (at the lower extremity of the right border) and ending (at the apex), and slightly convex upward in its centre as it crosses the middle of the ensiform. (6) The Area of Heart Didlness.—A quadrilateral area to the left of the median line and below the upper border of the fifth cartilage, nearly two inches in vertical and an inch and a half in extreme lateral measurements. See anterior bor- der of left lung below\ (7) The Auricles.—The Right: An ''ear-shaped" area facing to the left, covering the first inch of the third right space and cartilage with the portion of the sternum adjacent to the latter. Its long axis measures about two inches and

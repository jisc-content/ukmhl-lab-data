A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 248 foramen magnum, below which it is continued as the spinal cord. It is about three-quarters of an inch wide at the pons and three-eighths of an inch at its terminus. The Under Surface of the Medulla.—Through the middle of the medulla from before backward extends a fissure—the anterior median fissure—which divides it into two symmetrical halves. The fissure terminates at the pos- terior margin of the pons in a slightly enlarged cavity named the foramen caecum. About an inch behind the pons the anterior fissure will be found crossed by fibres passing from one side of the medulla to the other. This is the decussation of the an- terior pyramids of the medulla. Along the side of the anterior median fissure lie two well- marked ridges or bundles, which are the anterior pyramids of the medulla. They are Hmited externally by shallow grooves termed the anterolateral sulci; and external to these grooves are the lateral tracts or columns of the medulla. At the outer side of the anterior pyramids and close to the pons is developed a small oval nucleus—the olivary- body. The anterolateral groove is continued along the front of the olivary body and an offset from it around the back part called the posterior olivary sulcus. Just at the olivary body the anterolateral groove is in- terrupted by a thin lamella of fibres which curve around from the anterior to the posterior parts of the nucleus and are called*the external arciform fibres. DISSECTION. Divide the cerebellum along its median plane, open the halves, and expose the fourth ventricle.

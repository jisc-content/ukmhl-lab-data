A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 634 (on outer side) and with the posterior tibial and internal calcanean branch of the external plantar (on the inner side). DISSECTION. No incision through or around the sole is necessary. Working from the heel forward, dissect the skin off in one piece to the sides of the sole and toes (where its removal was stopped when on the dorsum of the foot). Cut away the entire flap. The superficial fascia will be found as a thick pad of fatty and connective tissue covering the sole. It is to be entirely removed so as to thoroughly expose the deep fascia. For this purpose the curved scissors will be found to be the most useful. Be careful to save the digital nerves which lie imbedded in the fat between the processes of the plantar fascia. The Superficial Fascia, or the subcutaneous tissue. This layer is much thickened in the foot to form pads at the bearing points of the sole for the protection of the deeper parts. These pads are found at the heel, ball of the foot and toes, and are seen to be composed of a coarse meshed framework of connective tissue filled with fat. The Plantar Fascia. Fig. 132. This is the specialized portion of the deep fascia of the foot which preserves its shape and protects its deeper parts. It covers the entire sole of the foot, but the central portion is much stronger and thicker than the lateral portions. The middle portion of the plantar fascia is narrow behind where it is attached to the under surface of the back part of the OS calcis, and widens out as it passes forward to the fore part of the foot where at the base of the toes it divides into five slips, one for each toe. Each slip passes for- ward, splits to enclose the tendons of the long and short flexor muscles of the toes, and is inserted into the lateral ligaments of the metatarsophalangeal articulation, and the deep transverse ligament of the heads of the tarsal bones.

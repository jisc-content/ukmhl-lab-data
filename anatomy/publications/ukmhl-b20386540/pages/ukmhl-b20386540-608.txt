606 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. second, third, and fourth pieces of the sacrum, and from the ridges of bone between the first, second, third, and fourth sacral foramina. From the deep surface of the great sacrosciatic ligament, and the upper margin of the great sacrosciatic notch. Insertion.—Into the upper border of the great trochanter near the front. The tendon of the pyriformis muscle is closely joined, near the trochanter, to the common tendon of the obturator internus and the gemelli muscles. If the tendons are carefully separated it will be found that the tendon of the latter muscles passes beneath and in front of that of the former muscle ; the posterior muscles have the anterior insertion into the great trochanter. Nerve Supply.—Muscular branches from the second sacral nerve of the sacral plexus. Action.—If the thigh is extended the muscles act solely as an external rotator. When the thigh is flexed it acts as an abductor. Acting from a fixed point upon the trochan- ter the pyriformis will carry the other side of the pelvis backward, whether the femur be extended or flexed. Obturator Internus and Gemelli. Figs. 114, 126, 127. (i) Obturator internus. From the inner surface of the true pelvis (including the obturator membrane), below a line drawn from the upper margin of the obturator foramen to the junction of the iliopectineal line near its ter- minus, and above a line drawn about the base of the spine of the ischium. Behind the muscle reaches to the anterior margin of the great sacrosciatic foramen, and in front, it extends on to the rami of the pubes and ischium. It also arises from the obturator fascia which covers it. See page 398. (2) Gemellus superior. From the external surface of the spine of the ischium. (3) Gemellus inferior.

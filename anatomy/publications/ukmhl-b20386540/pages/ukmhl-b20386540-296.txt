A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 294 brevis, pronator radii teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor longus poUicis, and pronator quadratus muscles, and the lower end of the radius. The accompanying veins are on the outer and inner sides of the artery. While the artery is overlapped by muscles in the upper part of its course, it is only covered by the fascia and skin in the lower two-thirds. Branches of tJie Radial Artery. (i) Radial recurrent. This is a large branch from the outer side of the artery below its origin. It passes out- ward, supplying branches to the supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and supinator brevis, then turns upward between the supinator longus (brachio- radialis) and brachialis anticus to terminate in branches to these muscles and by anastomizing with branches from the superior profunda artery. (2) Muscular. To the sur- rounding muscles. (3) Anterior carpal. A very small branch to the front of the carpus. (4) Superficial volar. Variable in size and occurrence. Usually a small branch to the base of the thumb muscles, and terminating in them ; at other times a larger branch that crosses beyond the thumb to anastomose with the ulnar to form the superficial palmar arch. For the remaining branches see back of hand. DISSECTION. Divide the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi ulnaris where they become tendinous, and the pronator radii teres at its outer and middle thirds. Clean the flexor sublimis digitorum, the anterior surface of the supinator brevis, the upper and lower thirds of the ulnar artery, and the ulnar nerve from the internal condyle to the wrist. Flexor Sublimis Dig'itorum. Fig. 66. Origin.â€”(i) From the internal condyle of the humerus and internal lateral ligament of the elbow-joint. (2) From

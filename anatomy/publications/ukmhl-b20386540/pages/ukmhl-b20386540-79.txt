79 THE NECK, ANTERIOR. them. The reason for this caution will grow more apparent as the dissection proceeds.) Leave the spinal accessory nerve passing through the muscle and terminat- ing in the trapezius. Incise the fascia which holds the submaxillary gland in position along the lower margin of the gland and turn the gland upward. Clean the suprahyoid and subhyoid muscles, being careful in all cases to save the nerve supply to them. The internal jugular vein, carotid arteries, and the branches of the external carotid, the cervical plexus, and all the nerves of the deep region of the neck will have to be dissected as far as convenient. Stylohyoid. Fig. 17. Origin,—From the back and outer surface of the styloid process near its base. Insertion.—Into the body of the hyoid bone near the greater cornu. The muscle splits to enclose the digastric tendon. Nerve Supply.—The facial. See page 61. Action.—To raise and retract the hyoid bone (and the parts connected to it). Omohyoid. Figs. 16, 17. Origin.—From the superior border of the scapula near the suprascapular notch, and the transverse ligament cross- ing the notch. Insertion.—Into the lower border of the hyoid bone, external to the sternohyoid. Behind the sternomastoid the muscle becomes tendinous and is held downward by a loop of the deep cervical fascia which is attached to the inner surface of the clavicle, first rib (its cartilage), and the manubrium. Nerve Supply.—The anterior portion by a branch direct from the descendens hypoglossi. The posterior portion, by filaments from the loop of communication formed by the descendens and communicans hypoglossi.

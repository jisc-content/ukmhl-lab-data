UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, POSTERIOR. 379 cuneiform bones. It is not attached to the ulna, but passes over it, helping to hold it in place. By extensions from the inner surface of the ligament to the ridges of the radius, the grooves upon the back of that bone are converted into canals, through which the long tendons of the muscles from the posterior of the forearm to the hand pass. These canals are arranged as follows :— Diag. 24. The Annular Ligament of the Wrist and the Approximate Relations of the Various Tendons.

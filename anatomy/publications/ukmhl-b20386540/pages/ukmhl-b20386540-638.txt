A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY, 636 Between these fasciculi pass the lumbricales and interossei muscles and the digital vessels and nerves. The central portion of the plantar fascia is connected at its margins to the Hgaments which cover the under surface of the bones of the foot, by fibrous septa, the external and internal intermuscular septa ; these divide the foot into three compartments. The lateral portions of the fascia are continuous with the margins of the central portion and pass into the deep fascia covering the dorsum of the foot and the lateral annular liga- ments of the ankle. In addition the external portion has a strong band which extends from the outer surface of the OS calcis and the external annular ligament, and is attached to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and the internal portion passes from the inner side of the os calcis and inter- nal annular ligament forward, to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. DISSECTION. Remove the plantar fascia by cutting away altogether the outer and inner portions. Incise the central part transversely about three inches from the heel, raise the anterior portion from the muscle beneath and carefully dissect it forward, dividing the strong intermuscular septum on each side of the mus- cle, until the insertions of the fasciculi are reached. Stop here to examine how the flexor tendons pass through the divided fasciculi while the digital nerves, vessels, and lumbrical muscles lie between the fasciculi themselves, then remove the fascia entirely. Leave the posterior portion attached to the muscle. The First Layer. The Plexor Brevis Digitorum. Fig. 133. Origin.â€”From the anterior part of the greater (inner) tubercle of the os calcis, from the deep surface of the middle portion of the plantar fascia for its posterior third, and from the sides of the intermuscular septa.

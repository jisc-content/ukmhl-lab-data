THE NECK, ANTERIOR. 95 Between the facial artery and vein are found these struc- tures, the posterior belly of the diagastric, the stylohyoid muscles, and the submaxillary gland. Branches of the facial in the neck : (a) The ascending palatine, {b) The tonsilla7\ These branches pass upward to supply the palate, fauces, tonsils, and pharynx; the former is behind, the latter in front, of the styloglossus muscle, which separates them, {c) The glandidai^ or sub- maxillary branches to that gland, as the facial passes through it. (d^ The subinental, a considerable branch which runs forward under the lower jaw and upon the mylohyoid muscle (being accompanied by the mylohyoid nerve), supplies the adjacent muscles, and turns upward over the chin to anastomose with the mental (of the inferior dental) and the inferior labial (of the facial). Besides the chain of anastomoses which is formed by the branches of the inferior thyroid, lingual, and facial upon the same side of the neck and face, all these branches which pass forward to the median line inosculate across the median line with similar branches from the other side. This also holds for the nasal, frontal, and supra-orbital branches of the ophthalmic. See page 65. (4) The Occipital Artery is given off from the posterior aspect of the external carotid. It runs upward and back- ward under the posterior belly of the digastric to a point between the transverse process of the atlas and the mastoid process. Here it is covered by the sternomastoid, splenius capitis, and origin of the digastric. Then its course is back- ward in the occipital groove, where it will be found when dissecting the back. See page 130. The artery is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, which winds downward and for- ward across the artery. In the anterior portion of the neck it gives off muscular branches to the adjacent muscles ; the

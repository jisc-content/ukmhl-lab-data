630 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. Action.—To extend the foot upon the ankle, to adduct the foot, to raise the inner border of the sole (inversion). The action of this muscle tends to prevent the production of flat foot by holding the tarsal bones firmly together, and inverting the sole. Peroneus Longus. Figs. 123, 124, 134. Origin.—From the external tuberosity of the tibia, from the outer surface of the head and upper two-thirds of the shaft of the fibula (lying posterior to the peroneus brevis), from the intermuscular septa on either side, and from the inner surface of the deep fascia in its upper third. Insertion (see /t?^?^).—The tendon of the muscle runs behind the external malleolus (having the tendon of the peroneus brevis in front), in front of the peroneal tubercle on the OS calcis, through the groove in the cuboid, across the foot to the base of the first metatarsal bone and the internal cuneiform. Behind the malleolus the two tendons have a common synovial sheath, in the sole the long tendon has a special one. A sesamoid bone is often found in the tendon as it crosses the cuboid bone. Nerve Supply.—The musculocutaneous which passes through the muscle. Action.—To extend the foot on the leg, to abduct the fore part of the foot, to depress the ball of the great toe (inner border of the foot) and raise the outer border of the foot (producing eversion of the sole). It is an important factor in maintaining the anteroposterior and transverse arches of the foot and in walking. Peroneus Brevis. Figs. 123, 124. Origin.—From the lower two-thirds of the outer surface of the fibula, overlapping the peroneus longus for its lower

620 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, and the trunk becomes the external saphenous. (3) The muscular branches. These supply the gastrocnemius, plan- taris, popliteus, and soleus, muscles. Grastrocnemius. Figs. 128, 129, 131. Origin.—By two heads from the posterior surface of the femur above each condyle and from the condyloid ridges of the same. Insertioji.—By the tendo-Achillis, common to it and the soleus, into the lower part of the posterior surface of the OS calcis. A bursa is found under the inner head of the muscle and another between the tendo-AchilHs and the upper part of the OS calcis. Nerve Supply.—The internal popliteal. Action.—To flex the leg upon the thigh, to extend the foot upon the ankle. In the first case the muscle acts with the flexors of the knee, and in the second with the extensors of the foot and ankle. The Popliteal Space. Fig. 128. This is the hollow behind the knee joint. It is diamond- shaped. Its boundaries are formed as follows :— Above, the biceps externally, the semitendinosus, semi- membranosus, the gracilis, and the sartorius, internally. Below, by the diverging heads of the gastrocnemius and in addition the plantaris at the outer side. On either side of the middle of the space are the condyles of the femur. The floor" of this space is formed by the back of the lower end of the femur, the posterior ligament of the knee joint, the posterior part of the articular rim of the tibia (covered by the above Hgament) and the popliteus muscle

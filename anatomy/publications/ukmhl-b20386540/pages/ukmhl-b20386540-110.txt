A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 110 Second Portion,—Superior intercostal. Third Portion.—Posterior scapular (more often than from the transverse cervical). The Vertebral Artery. Figs. lO, i8, 20, 22. This is the first branch of the subclavian. It arises from the upper and back part of the artery, near the inner edge of the scalenus anticus, passes vertically upward to enter the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra. The artery continues upward through all the foramina in the vertebrae above. On reaching the atlas it winds backward around the superior articular process, grooving the upper surface of the posterior arch, passes through a gap in the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, winds forward and unites with the opposite vertebral at the anterior margin of the foramen magnum to form the basilar artery. See page i 58. For the relations of the artery in the suboccipital triangle, see page 132. The artery is divided into the cervical, vertebral, occip- ital (see page 132), and intracranial portions. The cervical portion is the part of the artery before it enters the vertebral foramen. It lies in the interval between the longus colli and scalenus anticus muscles, and upon the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and sympathetic nerve. In front of it are the vertebral and internal jugular veins, the inferior thyroid artery, and, on the left side, the thoracic duct crosses it from within outward. The vertebral portion is that part of the artery in transit through the vertebral foramina, where it is surrounded by a venous plexus and sympathetic filaments.

566 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY, great trochanter will be raised; this produces internal rotation of the shaft of the femur. The ihopsoas and pec- tineus have this action. Adductor Long-us. Figs. 117, 119. Origi?t.—From the front of the body of the pubes just under the crest. hisertioji.—At the middle third of the femur, into the inner lip of the linea aspera. Nerve Supply.—The obturator nerve through its anterior division. Action.—To adduct, flex, and rotate the femur outward. If the femur is the fixed point, it will flex the pelvis and rotate it to the same side. Gracilis. Figs. 117, 119. Origin.—From the inner margin of the rami of the pubes and ischium, and from the lower half of the symphysis pubis. Insertion.—By a long slender tendon into the inner sur- face of the tibia in the angle formed by the tendon of the sartorius. Nerve Supply.—A branch from the anterior division of the obturator nerve. Action.—To adduct the thigh, to flex the leg; when the leg is flexed to rotate it internally. The Internal Saphenous Nerve. Figs. 117, 119. The longest branch of the anterior crural nerve. Be- ginning just below Poupart's ligament where the anterior crural nerve breaks up into its terminal branches, the inter- nal or long saphenous nerve descends along the outer side of the femoral artery through Scarpa's triangle, then enters Hunter's canal with the femoral vessels. In the canal the

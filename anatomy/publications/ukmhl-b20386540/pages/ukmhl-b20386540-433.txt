THE PERINEUM, EE MALE. 431 behind, forming the pouch of Doug-las ; below, the vagina is separated from the rectum for its last inch by the fibrous structures which, taken together, form the " perineal body ; " in the middle portion the vagina lies in contact with the rectum. At the sides : Above, the vagina is crossed by the ureters from above downward and forward ; below, it is embraced by the levatores ani muscles. The mucous membrane (probably modified integument) is thrown into longitudinal ridges upon the anterior and poste- rior walls of the vagina. These ridges are called the colunince rugarum. They extend upward from the vaginal orifice. The veins form a plexus about the vagina and commu- nicate with the hemorrhoidal and vesical plexuses. The arteries are from the anterior division of the internal iliac, viz. : vaginal, internal pudic, vesical, and uterine. The nerves are from the internal pudic, the fourth sacral, and the hypogastric sympathetic plexus. The Perineal Body. Fig. 85. This is the mass of elastic, fibrous, and connective tissue, with the adjacent portions of muscles, which fills in the space between the lower end of the vagina and vaginal orifice in front and the rectum and anus behind. It is tri- angular in anteroposterior section, the base at the integu- ment, the apex at the junction of the vaginal and rectal walls. The sides of the triangle measure about an inch. The Uterus. See Pelvic Viscera. The Female Urethra. Figs. 85, 86. Is about one and one-half inches long and one-fourth inch in diameter. It Hes along the anterior wall of the vagina. It opens into the bladder three-fourths of an inch behind the middle of the pubic symphysis, and externally in the middle line just in front of the orifice of the vagina.

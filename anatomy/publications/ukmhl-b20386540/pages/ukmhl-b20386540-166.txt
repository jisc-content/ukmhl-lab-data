A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 166 At the base exercise the greatest caution, so as to leave behind the cranial nerves and the other important structures there. About the nerves it may be well to leave the pia, as they usually are torn off with it. Anteriorly the lamina cinerea will be torn through if any force is attempted in taking up the pia. Do not attempt in any place to remove the blood-ves- sels entire, but with the scissors clip them wherever there is any resistance and turn to another place close by to continue their removal. The Brain. Figs. 23, 29. The brain is all that part of the cerebrospinal system contained within the cranial cavity. It varies in weight according to sex, age, race, and intelligence (see qualifica- tions later). At birth the brain bears a larger proportion to the body weight than at any later time ; it is for males as I : 5.85, and for females as i :6.5. The brain grows very fast up to the seventh year, but not so fast as the body weight increases, the ratio being brain to body as i : 13 or 14. The increase is more slowly up to the twentieth year, when the ratio to the body is as i : 30. From thirty to forty the brain grows very slowly, reaching its maximum weight between forty and fifty years of age. After the maximum is reached the brain begins to lose weight very slowly, at the rate of about an ounce for every ten years of life. The ratio of the cerebrum to the cerebellum is 8^ : i for males, and Z\ : i for females. Race.—The largest brains belong to the civilized races, Europeans (English, Germans, Scotch, etc.) and the Chinese. The smallest to the savage races, as the native Africans and Australians. I7ttellige7tce.—While there is some ratio between the degree of intelligence and the brain weight, it is at most very unreliable for comparison between individuals of the same race. As Dana states (''Text Book of Nervous Diseases "), among 100 intelligent persons the proportion of

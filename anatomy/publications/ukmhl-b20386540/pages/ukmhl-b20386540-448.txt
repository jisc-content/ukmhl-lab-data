A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 446 obliterate any ring. In health and normally there is no "ring." In this connection I wish to caution the student in reference to the usual anatomical descriptions of " rings," and ''canals." In the living subject there are no abdom- inal rings except during the descent of the testicle in foetal life or of a hernia at a later period. While in the subject a ring exists only if the above conditions appertain, or as a result of the dissector's labors. These so-called abdominal rings are then only places where openings can be made, or are ''potential " rings. The usual habit of giving measure- ments to these potential rings is to be deprecated, as nor- mally there are no rings, and if made by the dissector they may have any dimensions, according to his fancy or precon- ceived ideas. By applying measurements to openings that are normal only at a certain time in the individual's life an erroneous opinion is formed of the true relations of the parts, that will interfere, not only with a correct anatomical knowledge of the subject, but also with surgical work upon such regions. The Triang'ular Fascia. Fig. 89. Just above the symphysis some fibres of the external oblique pass across the median line to be inserted in the opposite ilicpectineal line and pubic crest, forming a small triangular ligament or fascia. The triangular ligament lies behind the internal column of the external abdominal ring, and in front of the conjoined tendon. It will not be seen until the external oblique is reflected. In the male the spermatic cord escapes from the external ring and passes into the scrotum ; in the female the round ligament appears, to quickly become lost in the tissues in front of the pubes.

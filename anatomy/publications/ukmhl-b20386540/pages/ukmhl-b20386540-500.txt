498 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. Relations.—Above and in front, liver, gall bladder, fora- men of Winslow. Below, pancreas. Behind, the common bile and pancreatic duct, and vessels passing to the liver. (2) The descending- portion is two and three-fourths inches long, and extends from the neck of the gall bladder to the level of the second or third lumbar vertebra. Relations.—Front, transverse colon and mesocolon. To the left, pancreas. To the left and posterior, the common bile duct. Behind, the right kidney, renal vessels, and vena cava. This portion of the duodenum is covered only in front by the peritoneum. Into this part of the duodenum the com- mon bile and pancreatic duct opens, at a point four inches from the pylorus. (3) The third or transverse portion of the duodenum, four or five inches long, is the most fixed portion of the alimentary canal. It crosses the spine over the second or third lumbar vertebra, in a slightly oblique direction, the right end being a little lower than the left. Relations.—In front, it is covered by the peritoneum, transverse colon and mesocolon, and the superior mesen- teric artery. Above, the pancreas, inferior pancreaticoduo- denalis artery, the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Behind, the crura of the diaphragm, vena cava, aorta. (4) The fourth or distal ascending* portion, usually described as a part of the third portion. This part is only one inch long, curves vertically upward, is nearly covered by peritoneum. It is held in position by a process of peri- toneum containing some muscular fibres and called the musculus suspensorius duodeni (of Treitz), which extends from the left crus of the diaphragm and tissues about the coeliac axis. Behind this band is the small fossa duo- denojejunalis, opening upward, and into which a retro- peritoneal hernia might possibly find its way.

A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 434 from femoral hernia, the former being to the inside and the latter to the outside of it. More externally, and always located with ease, is the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The crest of this bone terminates in this point, below which is a notch. In making measurements from this point, the thumb, over which is stretched the measur- ing tape, should be carried up from below until arrested in the notch below the spine. When the measurement is so made, the spine is truly a fixed point," but as usually performed, by trying to hold the thumb or finger upon the spine, it is not a fixed point, as the measuring finger will slide all around the place over an area of an inch. The dense band of fibres stretching between the anterior spine of the ilium and the spine of the pubes, formed by the aponeurosis of the external obHque muscle, is Pouparf s ligmnent. It is a very important landmark. The imt- bilicus is always present, always distinct, hence always easily located. Its position in the middle line a little below the midpoint between the ensiform and symphysis is very constant, the variations not amounting to enough to render it unreliable as a most important reference point. Directly behind it is the body of the third lumbar vertebra. Just below the ensiform the abdominal wall is depressed forming the *'pitof the stomach" or scrobiculus cordis. A furrow passes from this depression to a little below the umbilicus, marking the linea alba. Below this the abdomi- nal wall is not depressed. The masses of the recti muscles and the shallow grooves outside of them are usually seen. The grooves, when present, lie over the linea semilunares. The masses of the recti may be cut up transversely by shallow depres-

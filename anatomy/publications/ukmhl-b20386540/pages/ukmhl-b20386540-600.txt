598 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Anterior Tibial Nerve. Figs. 124, 125. The remaining branch of division of the external popli- teal nerve, the other being the musculocutaneous. The anterior tibial nerve descends through the substance of the extensor longus digitorum muscle, keeps at the outer side of the anterior tibial artery for its upper third, then runs upon the anterior surface of the artery in its middle third, leaves the artery in its lower third, remaining at its outer side, passes with the long tendons under the two bands of the anterior annular ligament, and terminates here by dividing into two branches, an internal and external. The internal branch continues forward along the outer side of the dorsalis pedis artery to the first interosseous space, receives a branch from the musculocutaneous and divides into collateral digital nerves to the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The external branch turns outward under the extensor brevis digitorum, becomes slightly enlarged, and from this enlargement filaments pass to the muscles and tarsal articulations. In its course the anterior tibial supplies muscular branches to the extensor longus digitorum, tibiahs anticus, extensor proprius hallucis, peroneus tertius, and the extensor brevis digitorum ; articular branches to the ankle and the tarsal joints.

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 303 wrist to the base of the little finger muscles (pisiform and hook of the unciform). Above it is continuous with the deep layer of the forearm fascia, tendon of the palmaris longus muscle, and thin fascia intervening between the superficial and deeper layer of flexor muscles of the fore- arm. Below the palmar fascia passes off from its lower border and anterior surface. Behind the ligament the tendons of the long flexors of the fingers and thumb and the median nerve (and artery if present) pass into the hand. Over the ligament, yet con- tained in compartments of the deep fascia, are found the tendon of the ulnar flexor, ulnar vessels and nerve, the tendon of the palmaris longus and radial flexor of the car- pus, then the radial vessels, and the tendons of the extensor muscles of the thumb. This order is from within outward. Sheaths of the tendons of the long* flexors of the fingers. These are formed of fibrous tissue passing from the sides of the fingers over the front of the tendons. In front of the joints the sheaths are very thin, but over the first and second phalanges they are reinforced by transverse fibres (vaginal ligaments). The sheaths are continuous above with the lower margins of the divided fasciculi of the palmar fascia. Internally they are lined with synovial membrane. The Superficial Palmar Arch. Fig. 66. This arterial arch is formed by the ulnar artery curving downward from the inside to the outside of the hand, where an anastomosis is established with the radialis indicis, prin- ceps pollicis, superficialis volse, separately; or with any two or all of them. It is sometimes formed by the median artery, see page 297. The position of the superficial arch is indicated by a line drawn across the palm on a level with the base of the extended thumb.

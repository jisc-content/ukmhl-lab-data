A MANUAL OF ANA TOMV. 408 The Hemorrhoidal Plexus. This venous plexus begins around the anus and extends upward upon the rectum. It empties the blood by the in- ferior hemorrhoidal vein into the internal pudic vein ; by the middle, into the internal iliac and superior hemor- rhoidal ; and by the superior, into the inferior mesenteric, which opens finally into the portal vein. This establishes a free venous communication from the anus to the portal vein, and so to the liver. There are no valves in these veins, so the blood can be dammed back from the liver or from the heart. The Inferior Hemorrhoidal Artery. See page 412. The Inferior Hemorrhoidal Nerve. See page 413. DISSECTION. Carefully divide the perineal fascia along the median line and across its posterior attachment and reflect the two portions. If the fascia has been par- tially destroyed in the dissection remove any parts left and complete the clean- ing of the structures forming and contained within the perineal triangle. The Perineal Triangle Is formed by the erector penis, accelerator urina^, and transversus perineae muscles. It contains the superficial and transverse perineal vessels and nerves. Erector Penis. (^Ischiocavernostis}) Fig. 82. Origin.—From the inner surface of the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium. Insertion.—Into the outer and under surface of the crus penis, and by a small slip around the crus penis, to pass over the dorsal vein of the penis (situated posterior to the anterior slip of the accelerator urinae). This small slip is

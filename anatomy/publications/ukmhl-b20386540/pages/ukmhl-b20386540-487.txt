485 THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. duodenum by its duct, which opens into this part of the bowel. The pancreas arises from budding cells posterior to the duodenum and between the two layers of the mesoduode- num ; its duct opens into that of the bile duct. The spleen arises posterior to the stomach, and also be- tween the two layers of the mesogaster. (10) After the rotation of the intestines and the change to the oblique position by the stomach, the great omentum is formed by the pouching of the mesogaster, below the spleen and as far as the first part of the duodenum, to the left and forward, to form a bag that hangs down in front of the rest of the intestines. Diags. 36, 37. (11) In the formation of the great omentum, the attach- ments of the primary mesogaster and transverse meso- colon are altered, until the great omentum seems, in the adult, to come from the lower border of the stomach to the anterior border of the colon, having looped down to form the apron. Consequently there is only one process of peritoneum which forms the posterior attachment of the great omentum, and it is between the folds of this the great omentum that the colon is situated, and the part of the great omentum passing to the backbone is called the trans- verse mesocolon. Diags. 38 and 40. (12) If the fcetal form remains throughout life the pos- terior fold of the omentum returns to the backbone for a separate attachment above the attachment of the meso- colon. Diag. 37. The description of the abdominal viscera will be brief and only include the gross anatomy. The descriptions will also be given consecutively, and their dissection later. This is to avoid unnecessary repetition.

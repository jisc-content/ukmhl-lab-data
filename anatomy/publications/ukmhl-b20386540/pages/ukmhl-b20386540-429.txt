THE PERINEUM, FEMALE. 427 DISSECTION. Remove the perineal fascia and dissect out the perineal triangle. This will be more difficult to do than in the male, as the parts are smaller, the sphincter vaginse (corresponding to the accelerator urinas) imperfectly developed and perforated by the vaginal orifice. After careful dissection, consult the male perineal triangle, page 408. Transversus Perinsei. Same as in the male. See page 410. The Erector Clitoridis. Smaller, but similar to the erector penis in the male. See page 408. The Sphincter Vaginae. In the male the accelerator urinse or the bulbocavernosus, page 410. Originates from the tendinous centre of the perineum, passes forward to the parts about the clitoris, surrounding the vagina. It is an indistinct, imperfectly developed plane of muscular fibres. DISSECTION. Divide the transversus perineas and sphincter vaginae muscles and reflect them. Cut away the erector clitoridis. Draw the clitoris forward and remove the mucous membrane between it and the urethral orifice. The orifice of the urethra presents in the middle line nearly midway between the pubic arch and the vaginal orifice. The Bulb of the Vagina, or Bulbi Vestibuli. This is the female representative of the corpus spongio- sum in the male. The bulb of the vagina consists of two portions, each about an inch long and lying upon the front and sides of the vaginal opening and just under the sphincter vaginae muscle. The bulbs are connected in front over the meatus urinarius by a narrow neck (pars intermedialis of Kobelt). The Clitoris. Figs. 85, 86. Morphologically identical with the male penis. It is

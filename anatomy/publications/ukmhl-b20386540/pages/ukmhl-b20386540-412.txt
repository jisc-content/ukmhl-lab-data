A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 410 not constant in man ; it is named, from its action, the com- pressor vense dorsalis penis. Nerve Supply.—Perineal. Action.—To compress the dorsal vein of the penis (by the small slip mentioned above) and so produce erection of the penis. The main part of the muscle compresses the crus penis, and so aids erection and maintains the penis erect after it becomes engorged. Trans versus Perinsei. (^SMperficial trajisversus perinc^i.) Fig. 82. Origin.—From the inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium. Insertion.—Into the tendinous centre of the perineum. Nerve Supply.—Superficial perineal. Action.—To fix the tendinous centre, aid in supporting the pelvic floor. Accelerator Urinse. {Bulbocavernosus.^ Fig. 82. Origin.—From the median raphe, reaching from the tendinous centre of the perineum forward upon the bulb of the penis to opposite the lower border of the symphysis. Insertion.—In three portions : (i) A small set of fibres anteriorly, which surround the corpora cavernosa (and, of course, the corpus spongiosum) to be inserted upon the dorsum of the penis above (or over) the dorsal vein of the penis. (2) A middle set, the most of the muscle, which passes forward around the corpus spongiosum (and so be- tween it and the corpora cavernosa) to the dorsum of the corpus spongiosum. (3) A third set posteriorly, also small, which surrounds the bulb of the penis behind the membranous urethra, and is inserted into the dorsum of the bulb and the superficial layer of the triangular ligament close to the exit of the urethra.

222 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. (p) The choroid vein collects the blood from the struc- tures of the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, follows along the margin of the choroid plexus to the foramen of Monro, where it joins the vein above to form the vein of Galen. (c) The vein of Galen is formed by the union of the veins of the corpus striatum and the choroid plexus at the foramen of Monro. It passes backward in the velum inter- positum, close to the middle line, and at the posterior margin of the splenium unites with a corresponding vein of the other side to form the common vein of Galen, which is about half an inch long and terminates in the straight sinus. Besides the veins which unite to form it, the vein of Galen drains the third ventricle, and the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, and the common or great vein of Galen the superior surface of the cere- bellum. DISSECTION. Remove the velum interpositum and the choroid plexuses, being careful in doing so to leave the pineal gland behind, as the gland is firmly adherent to the under surface of the posterior part of the velum. The Third Ventricle. Figs. 33, 34, 39, 43 to 46, 50, 51, 54. The third ventricle is now exposed. Its boundaries will be seen to consist of the following parts :— Laterally, the optic thalami and the crura of the pineal gland; in front, by the anterior pillars of the fornix, the anterior commissure, and the septum lucidum which fills in the gap between the pillars of the fornix ; behind, by the posterior commissure, the pineal gland and its diverging crura ; the floor is composed of the following structures already described in connection with the base of the brain,— (see Fig. 29) the lamina cinerea, optic chiasm, tuber cine-

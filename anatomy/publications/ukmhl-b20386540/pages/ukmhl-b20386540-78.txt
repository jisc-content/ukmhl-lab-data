A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 78 middle and upper thirds and the second from beneath the muscle at its middle. They run downward and backward to disappear in front of the trapezius muscle. Digastric. Figs. i6, 17. Origin.—Posterior belly, from the digastric groove in the temporal bone. Anterior belly, from the under surface of the lower jaw a little external to the symphysis. Insertion.—The two bellies are joined by a central tendon, which is fastened to the body and greater cornu of the hyoid bone by a process of the deep cervical fascia. This fascial loop is lined by synovial membrane. The tendon also passes through the stylohyoid muscle, divides the insertion of that muscle, and by it is aided in keeping its place. Nerve Supply.—The posterior belly, by the facial. See facial nerve, page 61. The anterior belly by the mylohyoid branch of the inferior dental, which is a branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. Action.—(i) Posterior portion. Raises and retracts the hyoid bone (and the structures attached to it). (2) The anterior portion. Depresses the lower jaw. Acting from above, it will raise and draw forward the hyoid bone. (3) Both portions acting will elevate the hyoid bone (and the parts connected to it, especially the tongue). Hence the significance of raising the lower jaw upward and forward in anaesthesia, to prevent the tongue falling backward and suffocating the patient. DISSECTION. Divide the sternomastoid muscle and the external jugular vein and reflect their extremities. (Always divide veins between two cords tied firmly around

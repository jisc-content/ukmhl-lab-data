588 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, cate with each other at variable points. They both have numerous valves. The Internal (Long") Saphenous Nerve. See page 566. The cutaneous branches of the external popliteal nerve are two small nerves which supply the superficial region of the upper and outer thirds of the leg. The Musculocutaneous Nerve. Fig. 122. This is one of the terminal branches of the external pop- liteal nerve just after it has turned around the neck of the fibula, the other being the anterior tibial. The musculocutaneous nerve descends between the pero- neus longus and brevis, which it supplies, pierces the deep fascia at the outer side of the leg at its lower and middle thirds, and is distributed to the integument covering the outer and front of the lower third of the leg, the dorsum of the foot, the front and inner side of the great toe, the contiguous sides of the second and third, third and fourth, and fourth and fifth toes. The opposite sides of the first and second toes are supplied by the termination of the anterior tibial nerve, and the outer side of the little toe and foot receives its innervation from the external saphenous nerve. Both of these nerves receive a filament from the musculo- cutaneous. The External or Short Saphenous Nerve.â€”See page 616. DISSECTION. Remove the deep fascia, leaving the annular ligaments in place. Clean all the muscles, vessels, and nerves upon the front of the leg and foot as far as possible without dividing any. At the last, after the relations of parts are fully seen, then remove the ante- rior annular ligaments, and the extensor brevis digitorum, and complete the foot.

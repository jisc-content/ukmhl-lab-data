These organs are situated at the back of the abdominal cavity, on either side of the spinal column, supported by an investment of adipose and connective tissue. The long axis of the kidney is vertical, its length 4 inches, corres- ponding to the last two dorsal and first two lumbar verte- brae, width 2 ^ inches, and thickness i inches. The right is usually a little lower than the left, owing to the liver above it crowding it downward. Relations.â€”Posteriorly, the kidney rests upon the dia- phragm in front of the eleventh and twelfth ribs, the quad- ratus lumborum, and psoas muscles, from which it is sepa- rated by the diaphragmatic fascia from the first, the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia from the second, and by the ilio- psoas fascia from the third. Behind it pass the twelfth dorsal, iliohypogastric, and ilio-inguinal nerves. The relations of the pleura are important though not intimate. Its parietal reflection descends into the angle between the diaphragm and the thorax, to the level of the lower border of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, and is repre- sented by a line crossing the neck of the twelfth rib and the outer end of the eleventh. The incisions for reaching the kidney may open into the pleural cavity if carried too high. Anterior surface of the kidney. The right is crossed in its upper half by the liver, in the lower half by the ascending colon and duodenum (latter covers inner one-fourth of lower half). The left has the stomach in front of its upper third, the splenic artery and pancreas in front of the middle third,, and the colon in front of the lower third.

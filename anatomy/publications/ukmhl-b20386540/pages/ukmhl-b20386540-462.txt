460 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The covering derived from the transversaHs fascia receives the name of the internal spermatic or infundibuliforni fascia ; that from the internal oblique muscle, partially composed of separate muscle loops and supporting connective tissue, forms the cremaster muscle (and fascia^ ; that from the ex- ternal oblique constitutes the exte^'nal spermatic fascia. By the passage of the testicle into the scrotum the internal and external portions of the gubernaculum become inverted, while the middle remains as a band joining the gland to the bottom of the scrotum. The inverted portions of the guber- naculum help to form the cremasteric muscle in part. The internal and external bands of the gubernaculum sometimes draw the testicle to the region of their attachment; this ex- plains the abnormal position of this organ in front of the pubes or in the region of the ischium or perineum. If the natural process is arrested the testicle may never leave the interior of the abdomen or it may be left in any part of its course through the abdominal wall (at any point in the inguinal canal). The places where the testicle enters and leaves the ab- dominal wall are called rings, and its course between these points the inguinal canal. As the testicle descends it takes with it a tubular process of peritoneum called the funicidar process. Naturally, this tube becomes closed at the internal ring and close to the testicle, and the intervening portion entirely obliterated. The portion attached to the testicle forms its tunica vaginalis. If the process is arrested any of these conditions may prevail: If the tube remains open above, fluid may pass into it, forming a congenital hydrocele, or the intestine may be- come prolapsed into the tube, giving rise to a congenital hernia. If it becomes closed at its extremities but open between, a hernia may still descend behind the funicular

464 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. folds of the peritoneum that attaches the alimentary canal to the back of the foetus. From the aorta branches pass to the various parts of the intestinal tube : To the stomach passes the gastric ; to the small and large intestine the superior mesenteric; and to the large intestine the inferior mesenteric. All these arteries run to their distribution be- tween the folds of the peri- toneum which encloses the alimentary canal. The growth of the bowel is mostly below the stomach and duodenum, and takes place faster than the growth of the corresponding part of the peritoneum, consequently the small intestine is thrown into numerous folds. One of these folds is in the duodenum and another in the large intestine (Diag. 33, b). As development proceeds the bend in the large intestine is brought nearer to the duo- denal curve and the mesentery acquires a distinct neck. (Diag. 34.) There now occurs a most interesting change. This change is the rotation of the intestinal tract below the duo- denum on the superior mesenteric artery as an axis, the large intestine, or the colic part of it, passing from the left Diag. 33.

642 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The External Plantar Nerve. Figs. 133, 134. This is the outer branch into which the posterior tibial divides behind the internal malleolus. The nerve (with the external plantar artery) runs forward and outward between the flexor brevis digitorum and the flexor accessorius, and divides into two branches at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, the superficial and deep. Before this division the nerve supplies muscular branches to the flexor accessorius and the abductor minimi digiti, and cutaneous twigs to the outer border of the sole of the foot. The superficial branch. This supplies muscular branches to the interossei in the space between the fourth and fifth toes, and the flexor brevis minimi digiti, a communicating branch to the internal plantar, and digital branches to the adjacent one and one-half outer toes (adjacent side of the fourth and fifth, and outer side of the latter). The deep branch. This accompanies the external plantar artery into the deep parts of the foot. It supplies the two (sometimes three) outer lumbricales, adductor hallucis, transversus pedis, and the rest of the interossei (those in the three inner spaces). The External Plantar Artery. Figs. 133, 134. This is the larger branch into which the posterior tibial divides behind the internal malleolus. The artery passes forward and outward, being covered by the abductor hallu- cis and the flexor brevis digitorum, to the outer segment of the foot until it reaches the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, where it turns short inward, passing deeply between the interossei muscles and the lumbricales and flexor ten- dons, and terminates at the posterior part of the space be- tween the first and second metatarsal bones where it forms

49 THE HEAD, ANTERIOR, The Orbital Fascia, or Periosteum. This lines the interior of the bones composing the orbit, is continuous with the dura through the optic foramen and the sphenoidal fissure, forms the capsule of the lachrymal gland, the lining for the lachrymal canal, and the pulley for the superior oblique muscle, at the anterior margin of the orbit becomes continuous with the periosteum covering the exterior of the bones, and also sends to the eye-lids a fibrous expansionâ€”the palpebral fascia. The Muscular Fasciae. This consists of the connective tissue envelopes for the muscles and the eye-ball anterior to the insertion of the recti and oblique muscles, from where it is reflected on to the eye- lids and orbital margin. This layer also forms the cover- ing for the nerves and vessels. Tenon's Capsule. This is the connective sheath for the optic nerve and the posterior two-thirds of the eye-ball. Anteriorly it passes into the fasciae for the muscles, the sclerotic coat, and ocular conjunctiva of the eye ; posteriorly it blends with the orbital fascia. The Frontal Nerve. Diag. 4. Fig. 11. This enters the orbit just external to the fourth nerve, crosses the levator palpebrae, and at the middle of the orbit divides into the supra-orbital and supratrochlear nerves. The former leaves the orbit through the supra-orbital foramen or notch, and the latter, after passing above the pulley of the superior oblique, leaves at the inner angle of the orbit. For the termination distribution of these nerves see page 25. 4

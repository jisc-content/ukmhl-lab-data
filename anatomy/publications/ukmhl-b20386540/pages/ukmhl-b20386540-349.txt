347 THE THORAX, Insertion.—Into the upper border of the eleven lower ribs a little external to the tubercles. Three or four of the lower muscles reach into the cartilages for their insertion. The direction of the fibres is from above downward and forward. The Internal. Origin.—From the inner border of the intercostal groove of the eleven upper ribs and cartilages ; from the sternum around to the angles of the ribs. Insertion.—The fibres pass downward and backward to the upper surface of the rib and cartilage below. Nerve Supply.—The intercostal nerves. Action.—The intercostal muscles act to bring together the ribs between which they are placed. The external inter- costals act upon the ribs alone, the internal upon the ribs and cartilages. Taken together, the action of the intercostal muscles is to elevate the ribs and cartilages. From this action two results follow. The chest is enlarged in two directions, transversely and anteroposteriorly. But this is not secured by the move- ment of the ribs upon two axes, as stated by most authori- ties ; such an explanation is not warranted by the construc- tion of the joints which unite the ribs to the spinal column. The reasons for the enlargement are these : First, the ribs move upon an axis passing through their heads and tubercles. This allows the rib to move as if hinged at these points, and the anterior end moves upward and downward. Second, the ribs increase in size from above downward (until the seventh rib is met with). Third, the ribs are not placed horizontally, but slope from behind downward and forward. Fourth, when the intercostal muscles act, they raise the ribs and cartilages into a more nearly horizontal

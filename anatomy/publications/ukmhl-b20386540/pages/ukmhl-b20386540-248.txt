A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 246 Within the stalk of white matter are situated four pairs of gray nuclei. The most conspicuous pair, situated within the centre of tlie white matter, is an oval nucleus with a dentated or serrated outline, and in consequence is called the corpus dentatum. The Pons. Figs. 29, 38 to 40, 47 to 49, 53. This is the portion of brain which intervenes between the crura and the medulla, and consists of anteroposterior fibres crossed transversely by the fibres connecting the hemispheres of the cerebellum as stated above. The pons is about an inch wide along the median line and narrows to half that width as it enters the cerebellum. It presents a shallow depression, in the middle line in which the basilar artery rests. See page 158. The upper and lower or anterior and posterior borders of the pons are well marked. At the upper border the crura cerebri pass backward out of sight, and at the lower border their continuation appears as the medulla. The posterior surface of the pons will be described with the fourth ventricle, of which it forms the anterior portion. On section, the pons presents two distinct areas. The ventral or anterior, and the tegmental or posterior (continu- ous with the tegmentum of the crura cerebri). The de- scription of the subdivisions of these regions belongs to the histology of the brain. The cerebellum and the pons are developed from the hindbrain, the former from its roof and the latter from its floor, while the cavity of the hindbrain remains as the an- terior part of the fourth ventricle. The Medulla. Figs. 29, 53, 54. This portion of the brain extends from the pons back- ward for about an inch and a quarter to the margin of the

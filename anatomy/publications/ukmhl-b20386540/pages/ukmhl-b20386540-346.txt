A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 344 mogastric nerves, pleural sacs, and lungs. Aorta at left and vena azygos major at right. Behind, longus colli muscle, dorsal vertebrae, thoracic duct, third, fourth, and fifth right intercostal arteries, left lower azygos vein, aorta, right pneumogastric nerve. DISSECTION. Remove the oesophagus, tying a cord around its lower end as it passes through the diaphragm. The Thoracic Duct. Diags. 20 to 23. This begins in the abdomen as the duct of the recepta- culum chyli in front of the first and second lumbar vertebrae and behind the abdominal aorta. The duct passes into the thorax through the aortic open- ing at the right of the artery, and then along the front of the spine, between the thoracic aorta on the left and the vena azygos major on the right, until at the third dorsal vertebra it turns to the left behind the aortic arch and oesophagus. It passes upward at the left of the latter into the neck, arches over the left subclavian artery and the apex of the left lung to empty into the junction of the left jugular and subclavian as they are forming the left innominate vein. At its opening into the vein there are two valves found. Other valves similar to those found in the veins are dis- tributed throughout its length. It is about fifteen or eighteen inches long, and in diameter varies from one-fourth to one-sixth of an inch. The thoracic duct receives the drainage from the lower extremities, abdominal organs (excepting the upper surface of the liver and abdominal walls), left lung, left side of the heart, left upper extremity, and left side of the head and neck. It empties all this collection into the beginning of the left innominate vein.

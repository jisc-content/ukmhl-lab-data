THE PERINEUM, MALE. 401 reaching to the bladder, prostate, and rectum. Beneath these structures the fascia is continuous with the similar layer from the opposite side. The fascia thus com- pletely closes the pelvic outlet and supports the pelvic viscera. At the side of the rectum, bladder, and prostate the fascia splits into two layers,â€”an upper layer that is reflected upward on to the rectum for a distance of two inches or so and becomes lost; on to the bladder it reaches upward above the seminal vesicles (thus shutting them out from the pelvic cavity proper), then merges into the wall of the bladder. The lower layer is continued inward to join the opposite layer beneath the bladder, and also sends a lamina down- ward to enclose the prostate, form its capsule, and become continuous with the deep layer of the triangular ligament. Between the fascia, bladder, and prostate lies a collection of large veins known as the vesicoprostatic plexus. The rectum lies in close contact with the prostate and the base of the bladder, separated from them only by a layer of the rectovesical fascia, which is reflected upward and downward upon it. The lower layer is lost in the muscular tissue of the rectum above the anus ; the upper reflection can be traced about two inches, when it, too, is lost in the sub- stance of the bowel. The portions of the fascia reaching to the rectum are called the true lig-aments of the rectum, and the portions reaching to the sides of the bladder are likewise called the lateral true lig-aments of the bladder. Besides these liga- ments (all parts of the same fascial plane) the fascia which extends from both sides of the inner surface of the pubes to the front of the neck of the bladder and prostate are called the anterior true ligaments of the bladder and prostate. These are the best marked, and contain involuntary muscu- 26

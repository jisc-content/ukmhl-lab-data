A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 424 (5) The Fourchette.—The narrow fold or band of membrane (integument) which joins the labia minora pos- teriorly (usually torn in childbirth). (6) The Vestibule.—This is the median gutter which extends from the clitoris in front to the hymen or its re- mains behind, and is bounded laterally by the labia minora. Into it opens the meatus urinarius. (7) The Hymen.—An irregular, ring-like fold of mem- brane (probably integument), which surrounds the entrance to the vagina. It is really external to and below the vagina (D. S. Lamb). Torn in childbirth always. The numerous small nodules remaining to mark the site of the hymen in women who have had children are called the carunculse myrtiformes. (8) The Meatus Urinarius.—The external opening of the female urethra is in the median line of the vestibule and about three-fourths to one inch from the clitoris. (9) The Fossa Navicularis is the shallow depression between the hymen (internally) and the fourchette (exter- nally.) (10) The Orifice of the Vagina lies in the middle line. It is narrowed in the virgin by the hymen, and surrounded in the matron by the carunculae myrtiformes. (11) Opening of the Ducts of the G-lands of Bar- tholin is on the inner side of the labia minora, external to the hymen, and on a level with the middle of the vaginal orifice. The Anus. See page 406. DISSECTION. Distend the vagina and rectum with oakum, and take several interrupted sutures in the labia majora and the anus.

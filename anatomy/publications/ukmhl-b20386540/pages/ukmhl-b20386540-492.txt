A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 490 tudinal fissure. This fissure consists of two parts ; the anterior (the umbilical), in which the umbiHcal vein lies ; and the posterior for the ductus venosus, a venous trunk which joins the umbiHcal vein to the vena cava (by way of a hepatic vein). These veins are foetal structures. The gall bladder occupies a shallow hollowâ€”the fissure of the gall bladder. Between the fissures for the umbilical vein and the gall bladder, is the quadrate lobe, bounded behind by the transverse fissure and in front by the anterior border of the liver. The quadrate lobe is often connected to the left over the umbilical fissure forming the pons hepatis. The lower surface of the liver shows several slight de- pressions produced by contact with the various abdominal organs beneath it; these are called impressions. They are for the stomach, hepatic flexure, duodenum, and right kidney. (3) The posterior surface is poorly marked. It may be defined as that part of the liver behind the transverse fissure. It is deeply concave from side to side to accom- modate the spine and crura of diaphragm. It contains a vertical gutter in which lies the vena cava inferior, and called the fissure for the vena cava. At the left of the vena cava is the Spigelian lobe, separated from the left lobe by the fissure for the ductus venosus. The Spigelian lobe is connected with the right by a slender tongue or ridge of liver substance known as the caudate lobe. It will be seen that the fissures of the liver can be ar- ranged like the letter H." The right leg is made up of the fissures for the gall bladder and vena cava, the left by the umbiHcal and fissure of the ductus venosus, the cross bar is the transverse fissure.

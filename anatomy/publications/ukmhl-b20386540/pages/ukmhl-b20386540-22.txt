22 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, The External Portion of the Parieto-occipital Fis- sure.—This is five-twelfths to five-eighths of an inch in front of the lambda, or one and seven-eighths inches behind the central extremity of the fissure of Rolando, and extends about an inch outward and slightly forward on either side of the median line. The Principal Sulci. The Frontal Lobe.—The superior frontal sulcus is indicated by a line starting from the supra-orbital notch (at the inner and middle thirds of the supra-orbital arch), drawn backward parallel with the median line until within an inch of the fissure of Rolando. The inferior frontal sulcus coincides with the frontal part of the temporal ridge (the bony not the muscular ridge). It begins at the E. A. P., and follows the curve of the ridge upward and backward until within an inch of the Rolandic fissure. This sulcus is parallel with and about an inch from the preceding one. The superior, middle, and inferior convolutions are thus indicated, and the region in front of the fissure of Ro- lando and an inch in width will correspond to the ascend- ing" frontal convolution. The Parietal Lobe.—The intraparietal sulcus is shown by drawing a line from a point one inch behind the fissure of Rolando and the same distance above the horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure upward, one inch from and par- allel with the first fissure, until at the junction of its middle and upper thirds, where the line turns backward to run parallel with the middle line, and about an inch and a quar- ter from it, until it terminates a little behind the parieto- occipital fissure in the occipital region. The space behind the fissure of Rolando and in front of the first part of the

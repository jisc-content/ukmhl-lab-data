93 THE NECK, ANTERIOR, fascia, parotid gland; the sternomastoid overlaps the artery to a greater or less extent from behind forward. It is crossed from above downward by the branches of the facial nerve, the temporomaxillary vein, stylohyoid, and posterior belly of the digastric muscles, the facial and lingual veins, and the hypoglossal nerve. Internal, or centrally, the internal carotid, from which it is separated by the stylopharyngeus, styloglossus muscles, the glossopharyngeal, and pharyngeal branch of pneumogastric nerves, the posterior part of the paro- tid gland, and the stylomastoid ligament. The superior laryngeal nerve Hes behind both internal and external carotids. Anterior, or in front, the hyoid bone, pharynx, stylo- maxillary ligament, ramus of jaw. Posterior, or behind, the internal carotid for a short dis- tance at its beginning, the hypoglossal nerve, the occipital artery, mastoid process. Branches.â€”(i) The Superior Thyroid: This is the first branch from the anterior surface of the artery. Its course is forward beneath the great cornu of the hyoid bone, then downward and forward to the upper part of the thyroid gland. In its course it gives off branches to the larynx, pharynx, thyroid gland, trachea, and oesophagus; also, muscular branches to the sternomastoid, sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid, and inferior constrictor. The named branches are (a) the hyoid, which passes transversely forward between the hyoid bone and the thy- roid cartilage. {U) The sternoinastoid, to that muscle. This branch crosses the carotid sheath, (c) The superior laryngeal, w^hich accompanies the nerve of the same name into the interior of the larynx, (d^ The cricothyroid. Of

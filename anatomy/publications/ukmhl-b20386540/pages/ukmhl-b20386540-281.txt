UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 279 circumflex is a small branch from the outside of the axillary opposite the surgical neck of the humerus, around which it turns, under th^ coracobrachialis and biceps muscles, to end in the deltoid. At the bicipital groove it gives off a branch (articular) which passes upward in the groove to the shoulder-joint, (c) The posterior circumflex, nearly as large as the subscapular, is given off the back of the axil- lary, continues through the quadrilateral space formed by the subscapularis, teres major, long head of triceps, and humerus, with the circumflex nerve. For the continuation of the artery see page 372. {d~) The external mammary. This is usually described as an abnormal branch, but is found so frequently that it deserves a place with the more constant branches of the axillary, from which it arises at the lower margin of the axillary space and takes a course downward, forward, and inward in the subcutaneous tissue to the mammary region. Subscapularis. Fig. 63. Origin.—From the inner two-thirds of the subscapular fossa on the anterior surface of the scapula, from the lower two-thirds of the axillary border of the same and inter- muscular septum between it and the teres minor. hisertion.—Into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, the surgical neck just below it, and into the capsule of the shoulder-joint. The nerve supply, from the first (upper) and third (lower) subscapular nerves. Action.—To rotate the humerus inward ; if the arm is extended, to slightly adduct the humerus. When the humerus is fixed it acts upon the scapula to turn it forward. Serratus Magnus. Figs. 63, 76. Origin.—From the outer surfaces and upper margins of the eight (or nine) upper ribs at their anterior and middle

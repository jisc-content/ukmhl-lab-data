603 THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. Insertion.—Into the iliotibial band over the great tro- chanter of the femur. Into the gluteal (vertical) ridge which extends from the posterior surface of the great tro- chanter to the outer bifurcation of the linea aspera. A distance of about two inches. Nerve Supply.—The inferior gluteal branch of the sacral plexus. This nerve is usually included within the sheath of the small sciatic and consequently is said to be a branch of that nerve. See page 552. Action.—The attachments of all the posterior muscles of the thigh should be very carefully determined, then their action when the thigh is in an extended position, and finally when it is flexed at various angles. It will only be by such careful study that the complex actions of these gluteal and external rotator muscles will be understood. To attempt to commit to memory the action of muscles from the book is all wrong, unless the demonstration is carried out upon the subject (living or dead) and by the use of the skeleton. Action of the gluteus maximus. (1) When the thigh is extended, it acts as an external rotator; its upper fibres will assist abduction, and its lower fibres will assist adduction ; the action of the whole muscle neutraUzes these movements. (2) When the thigh is flexed. The muscle is a power- ful extensor of the thigh, it is also a strong abductor (in flexion) ; abduction diminishes as flexion decreases and ex- tension increases (in other words, as the individual assumes an upright position). (3) Upon the leg, it will assist flexion when once started, and external rotation, through the iliotibial band, along with the tensor vaginae femoris. In full extension of the leg the muscle helps to main-

286 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Brachial Artery. Figs. 62, 63, 67. The brachial artery is the continuation of the axillary from the lower border of the teres major to half an inch below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. Relations.â€”On the outside : The coracobrachialis, bi- ceps (which slightly overlaps the artery in front), and the median nerve (at the upper part). The inner border of these muscles is the sure guide to the artery. The median nerve, though formed at the outside of the artery above, crosses in front (usual) or behind (unusual) the artery to its inside at the elbow. One of the accom- panying veins is to the outside. Behind : The brachial rests upon the triceps, tendon of the coracobrachialis and brachialis anticus muscles. It may have the median nerve behind its middle. At the inside is the other accompanying vein. These venae comites are joined by frequent cross branches. The basilic vein takes a course upward at the inside of the artery but separated from it by the deep fascia in the lower part of its course. The ulnar and internal cutaneous nerves are at some little distance from the upper part of the artery, and in its lower two-thirds have no direct relation to it. In front: The brachial is covered by the integument, two layers of fascia, and the inner border of the biceps muscle. The median nerve is in close relation to the artery and crosses its front about the middle (usual). At the elbow the brachial has the median basilic vein in front of it, and separated from it by the bicipital fascia. It lies be- tween the tendon of the biceps at the outside and the median nerve at the inside.

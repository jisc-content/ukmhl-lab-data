89 THE NECK, ANTERIOR. the descendens hypoglossi, which suppHes the thyrohyoid muscle, and a recurrent twig to the styloglossus. Under the mylohyoid the hypoglossal gives branches to the hyoglossus, geniohyoid, geniohyoglossus, genioglossus, and the muscular substance of the tongue. The Cervical Plexus. Figs. i6, 17, 18. The cervical plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the four upper cervical nerves, which appear along the side of the neck between the prevertebral and lateral sets of muscles, and are connected in series by interlacing branches. A diagrammatic representation of the plexus is given on page 75. Diag. 6. Branches,—From the loop joining the first and second nerves is given off:— (1) A branch which passes forward to join the hypo- glossal nerve. (2) From the second nerve is given off the small occip- ital. (3) From the second and third nerves are given off branches to form the great auricular (4) the superficial cervical and (5) the communicantes hypoglossi. The second and third are joined by a loop. From the third proceeds the (6) nerve to the trape- zius. From the third and fourth the (7) sternal, (8) clavi- cular, (9) and acromial branches. From the fourth (and fifth, of brachial plexus) arises (10) the phrenic. (11) Muscular branches are derived from the first for the rectus capitis lateralis and the rectus capitis anticus minor; from the first and second, for the rectus capitis anticus

Remove the superficial fascia from the same area as the skin, leaving the deep fascia miinjured behind. The Deep Fascia. This is a very thin layer covering the pectoralis major. Anteriorly it is attached to the front of the sternum, above to the clavicle, externally it passes on to the deltoid muscle, and below turns over the lower border of the pector- alis major and stretches across the axillary space (axillary fascia^ to the latissimus dorsi muscle, which it covers. Externally the axillary fascia passes into the deep fascia covering the arm. The axillary fascia (and integument) is deeply hollowed when the arm is extended to an angle of 45 degrees with the trunk. This is due to the attachment of the fascia cov- ering the pectoralis minor muscle. See page 270. DISSECTION. Remove the deep fascia, cutting parallel with the fibres of the muscle it covers. In turning down the axillary fascia be careful to save the nerves which will be found coming out from the axillary space. Clean the cephalic vein from the middle of the arm to where it disappears through the costocoracoid membrane (see below), the branches of the acromiothoracic artery, and the external anterior thoracic nerve. Pectoralis Major. Fig. 60. Origin.—The clavicular portion, from the anterior sur- face of the inner half of the clavicle. The sternal portion, from the anterior surface of the sternum, from the anterior surface of the second to sixth costal cartilages inclusive, also, sometimes, the first and seventh cartilages, and from the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus abdominis. Insertion.—Into the anterior or external lip of the bicipi-

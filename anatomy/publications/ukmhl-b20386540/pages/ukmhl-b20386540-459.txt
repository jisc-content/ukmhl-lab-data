457 THE ABDOMEN, EXTERIOR. having the cord or round Hgament curving around its outer side, and passing upward and inward to enter the sheath of the rectus muscle, over the semilunar fold of Douglas, to finally inosculate with the superior epigastric in the substance of the muscle. The position of the artery is between the two abdominal rings, or to the irmer side of the internal, and to the outa- side of the external ring. It takes part in the formation of Hesselbach's triangle, constituting its outer side, the other boundaries being the outer margin of the rectus to the inside and Poupart's ligament for the base. Through this triangle the direct inguinal hernia must pass. The Formation of the Abdominal Rings, Coverings of the Testicle and Cord.â€”In order to make the subject clear we must turn to the development of the parts. Take the time in the development of the foetus when the testicle is at the back part of the abdomen, below the kidney and behind the peritoneum, which encloses its front and sides, forming the inesorchium. The testicle has the gnber- naculuni, a fibromuscular cord passing from its lower border through the abdomen to be attached in three main divisions, a middle band passing to the bottom of the scrotum, an anterior one to the structures in front of the pubes, a posterior one to the tissues over the ischiatic region. The testicle descends to reach the inner surface of the abdominal wall and the gubernaculum shortens ; whether the testicle descends because of the contraction of the gubernaculum, or its shortening is only an incident in the descent of the testicle, are disputed points with no w^ay of solution. The testicle is preceded in its descent by a pro- cess of the peritoneum which is drawn downward as it were by the gubernaculum. It also takes with it the peritoneum by which it is nearly enclosed. Arriving against the inner

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 305 the adjacent sides of the ring and little fingers. The third takes a similar course and distribution to the middle and ring fingers. The fourth is distributed to the adjoining sides of the index and middle fingers in the same manner. These digital arteries lie between the fasciculi of the palmar fascia, and long flexor tendons of the fingers, and upon the lumbrical muscles and digital nerves, and are covered by the palmar fascia. Just before they bifurcate they are joined by the inter- osseous branches of the deep arch and the perforating from the dorsal interosseous arteries. The remaining side of the index finger is supplied by the radialis indicis, and the thumb by the princeps pollicis, both from the radial artery. See page 310. (3) The muscular and cutaneous branches from the superficial arch are few and small. The Digital Nerves. Fig. 66. The median nerve supplies two branches to the thumb, one on either side ; a third to the outer side of the index finger; a fourth, to between the index and middle ; and a fifth, between middle and ring fingers ; each of which sub- divide to supply the contiguous sides of these fingers. The third and fourth nerves send a fine branch to the two outer lumbrical muscles, the fifth receives a communi- cating branch from the ulnar nerve. From the ulnar nerve the rest of the fingers are supplied, the first digital branch being given off to the inner side of the little finger, and the second to between the little and ring fingers, which then divides into collateral branches to the adjacent surfaces of these two fingers. From the outer side of the second branch is given a small filament to join the median. See above. From the median nerve just below the annular 20

THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR, 609 Semitendinosus. Fig. 126. Origin.—By a tendon common to it and the long head of the biceps from the lower (anterior) and internal facet upon the tuberosity of the ischium. Insertion.—By a long slender tendon into the inner sur- face of the tibia opposite its tubercle, where it lies behind the sartorius and below the gracilis. Also, into the deep fascia of the leg. A bursa intervenes between the three tendons and the internal lateral ligament of the knee. Nerve Supply.—Great sciatic. See biceps, above. Action.—(i) Upon the leg, to flex the leg and in a flexed position to rotate it inward (pronation). (2) Upon the thigh, it is an extensor, and used for the lesser muscular efforts. (3) Upon the pelvis it acts as an extensor, as in raising the body from a stooping position. Semimembranosus. Fig. 126. Origin.—From the external and upper (posterior) facet upon the tuberosity of the ischium. To get to this posi- tion the tendon of the semimembranosus passes forward of, then external to, the common tendon of the long head of the biceps, and the semitendinosus muscles. Insertion.—Into the transverse groove upon the back of the internal tuberosity of the tibia ; by a strong recurrent bundle of fibres, which crosses the knee joint obliquely, into the outer posterior surface of the external condyle of the femur; and by a continuation of the direct fibres into the fascia covering the popliteus muscle, and so into the oblique line upon the posterior surface of the tibia. Nerve Supply.—The great sciatic, the filaments coming from the first, second, and third sacral nerves. Action.—(i) Upon the leg, the muscle acts as a flexor, 39

Their course through the bladder wall is very oblique, so that they issue only three- fourths of an inch posterior to the internal opening of the urethra and the same distance apart. The Vas Deferens. Figs. 92, 94, 103, 112, 84. One on each side. Conveys the seminal fluid from the testicle to the seminal vesicles. It is about twenty-four inches long and one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter. Starting from the globus minor of the testicle, it ascends with the structures forming the cord through the external abdominal ring, the inguinal canal, the internal ring, around the deep epigastric artery. It now leaves the other structures of the cord and runs inward across the psoas muscle and external iliac vessels to the side of the bladder. In the ab- domen it lies behind the peritoneum for its entire course to the bladder. Descending along the posterior wall of the bladder, it passes in front of the obliterated hypogastric arteries and the ureter (between them and the bladder) to the notch at the base of the prostate. In the last part of its course it is between the bladder and the rectum. In the prostatic notch the vas unites with the seminal vesicle to form a single tube, the ejaculatory duct, which continues through the prostate to open upon the floor of the urethra. The length of the duct is about three-fourths of an inch. The one and one-half inch of the vas adjacent to the prostate is dilated and receives the name of ampulla. See page 420. The Uterus. Figs, no, in. The uterus is the reproductive organ of the female. It varies in size with the age and condition of the individual. In

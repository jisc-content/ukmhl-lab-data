318 A MANUAL OF AA^A TOMY. The digital branch to the ring finger receives a communi- cating branch from the ulnar. See Ulnar'- above. From the posterior cord, {a) The subscapular nerves, three in number, arise from the posterior cord immediately after its formation. The first (upper) supplies the upper part of the subscapularis muscle. The second (the long) the latissimus dorsi muscle. The third (lower) the lower portion of the subscapularis and the teres major muscles. ip) The circumflex nerve. Turns backward with the posterior circumflex artery through the quadrilateral space formed by the humerus, long head of triceps, subscapularis (teres minor behind), and teres major muscles, to be dis- tributed to the teres minor and deltoid muscles and the integument over the outer and posterior part of the shoulder, {c) The Musculospiral. Continues the pos- terior cord into the arm. It winds through the groove of the same name with the superior profunda artery to reach the interval at the outer side of the elbow between the supinator longus (brachioradialis) and the brachialis anti- cus, where it divides into its two terminal branches, the radial and posterior interosseous. The radial descends under cover of the supinator longus to the lower third of the wrist, turns backward to the posterior part of the hand, and supplies the integument on the back of the hand and two and one-half fingers (thumb, index, and outer side of the middle fingers). The posterior interosseous passes backward through the supinator brevis, and descends be- tween the posterior muscles of the forearm as low as the back of the carpus, where it terminates in a gangliform en- largement. The musculospiral supplies the triceps, supi- nator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, and anconeus muscles; and by its superior and inferior cutaneous nerves the integument of the lower part of the outer side of

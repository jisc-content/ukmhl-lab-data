The nerve communicates with the musculocutaneous on the dorsum of the foot, supplies the integument along its course, and is accompanied by the external saphenous vein. The External or Short Saphenous Vein. For its formation, see page 586. The vein follows upward along the outer part, then the back of the leg to the middle of the popHteal space, where it pierces the deep fascia and empties into the popliteal vein. Its tributaries are numerous cutaneous veins from the outer and back parts of the foot and leg, and a large descending one from the back of the thigh. It communi- cates with the deep veins through the deep fascia, and with the internal saphenous near its termination. The Deep Fascia. See page 584. DISSECTION. After cutting through the fascia in the middle line remove it together with the external saphenous vein, but leave the nerve behind. Clean out the popliteal space. The External Popliteal Nerve. Fig. 128. This is the outer branch of bifurcation of the great sciatic nerve, and runs from the upper part of the pophteal space along the inner border of the tendon of the biceps muscle to the neck of the fibula, around which it turns, lying close to the bone and covered by the peroneus longus muscle. Here it divides into its two terminal branches, musculocutaneous and the anterior tibial, for which see pages 588 and 598. Branches of the External Popliteal. (i) Articular, to the knee joint, which they reach by fol- lowing the superior and inferior external articular branches

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 350 receives the six left, lower intercostal veins, the left medi- astinal, and oesophageal veins (lower). (3) The left superior azygosâ€”azygos tertius (often ab- sent). When present, receives the fourth to the seventh or eighth intercostal veins inclusive, some mediastinal, and the left bronchial veins. It communicates with the left superior intercostal vein above, and empties into the azygos major below. (4) The right superior i?itercostal vein is formed by the second, third, and sometimes fourth right intercostal veins, and empties into the azygos major as it arches to terminate in the vena cava superior. The first right intercostal vein empties into the innomi- nate or vertebral vein. (5) The left superior intercostal^ formed by the first two or three left intercostal veins, opens into the innominate (left). It communicates below with the left superior azygos. The Intercostal Nerves. Fig. 74. These are the anterior branches of the twelve dorsal nerves which supply the walls of the chest and abdomen. The first intercostal nerve sends four-fifths of its fibres to join the brachial plexus and the remaining fifth takes a course similar to the other intercostal nerves. The intercostal nerves from the second to the sixth in- clusive terminate anteriorly as the anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax. See page 266. The next nerves below, from the seventh to the eleventh inclusive, course between the transversalis and internal oblique muscles, and termi- nate in front as the anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdo- men. The course of the twelfth is given with the lumbar plexus. All these nerves give off lateral cutaneous

319 THE THORAX. the arm, and the posterior, outer surface of the forearm nearly to the elbow. The posterior interosseous nerve sup- plies the extensor carpi radialis brevior, supinator brevis, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, ex- tensor carpi ulnaris, extensor metacarpi pollicis, extensor indicis, extensor brevis, and longus pollicis muscles. The intercostohumeral nerve, after entering into a plexi- form arrangement with the lesser internal cutaneous and cutaneous branch of the third intercostal nerve at the floor of the axilla, continues outward, downward, and sends some filaments posteriorly to supply the integument of the upper posterior part of the arm and axilla, over the latissimus dorsi muscle. The nerves receive their fila7nents from the following sources:— The suprascapular and subclavius—5, 6, 7. * The external anterior thoracic, 5, 6, 7. Musculocutaneous, 5, 6, 7. The internal anterior thoracic, 8, i. Lesser internal cutaneous and internal cutaneous, 8, i. Ulnar, (7), 8, i. Subscapular, circumflex, and musculospiral, 5, 6, 7, 8. The median, 5, 6, 7, 8, i. THE THORAX. For the landmarks see page 255. The dissection of the soft parts anterior to the ribs has been already per- formed, and their description given in the preceding pages. Remove the sternum and costal cartilages by cutting through the latter as close to the ribs as possible (when the ribs are not needed, the division had Numerals refer to the number of the cervical and dorsal nerves forming the brachial plexus.

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 476 the transverse colon. This is the great, or gastrocolic omentum. Raise the great omentum and with it the transverse colon. The peritoneum passing from this part of the colon to the posterior abdominal wall is the lower layer of the transverse mesocolon. From the posterior attachment the peritoneum extends down upon the small intestines ; enclosing them, it returns to the abdominal wall, these two surfaces forming the right upper and left lower layers of the mesentery. It will be seen that the mesentery has a short base which is attached to the abdomen in an oblique line extending from the left of the second lumbar vertebra downward to end in the right iliac fossa, that its intestinal end equals the length of the small intestine, that its width is about eight inches. From the lower end of the mesentery the peritoneum is seen to cover the beginning of the large intestine—the caecum—and the little process—^the vermiform appendix —that extends off from it. The appendix has a narrow mesentery, the caecum has none ; botJi are free in the peri- toneal cavity. Upward from the caecum passes the as- cending" colon, which is found covered with peritoneum in front and at the sides, that at the right being continued as the lining or parietal layer of the abdomen, that to the left being continued into the right surface of the mesentery. Sometimes the colon has a distinct mesentery. The bend formed by the junction of the ascending and transverse colon is the hepatic flexure ; from its outer bor- der an extension of the transverse mesocolon is found which is attached to the adjacent abdominal wall. This is the sustentaculum hepatis, because the right extremity of the liver rests upon it. At the left the transverse colon takes a sudden bend

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 156 The Function of the Cerebrospinal Fluid, It forms a ''water-bed " upon which the brain rests, and is thus protected from injury by coming in contact with the projections of the bones forming the base of the skull. It equalizes the intracerebral pressure, by flowing away from the brain when the blood supply is too great, and toward the brain when it is insufficient. The nerves to the arachnoid are derived from the fifth, seventh, and eleventh cranial nerves (Bochdaleck). The lymphatics from the subarachnoid spaces (which are really lymph channels) communicate with those of the internal ear, mucous membrane of the nose, and the superior longitudi- nal sinus ; but are not in direct communication with the general lymphatic system of the head. The subarachnoid spaces receive the lymphatics from the brain (and the spinal portion from) the cord. DISSECTION. Carefully remove the arachnoid covering in the anterior and posterior sub- arachnoid spaces. It will be useless to attempt to remove it from any other part of the brain. The dissection of the pia consists in tracing out its vessels. This should be done with great patience ; haste means destruction of important parts. The Pia. Figs. 20 and 21. This is the most internal membrane enveloping the brain. It is really a layer of blood-vessels held together by suf- ficient connective tissue to preserve their relations, which is closely applied to all parts of the outer surface of the brain, reaching into all the fissures and sulci, and even passing into the interior of the brain as the velum interpositum and choroid plexuses of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. It is to be noted that these extensions from the general pia, though apparently within the brain, are still really ex-

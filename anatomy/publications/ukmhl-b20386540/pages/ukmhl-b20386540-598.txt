A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY, 596 third, and fourth spaces, resting upon the interosseous muscles. At their beginning they communicate with the plantar arch by means of the posterior perforating- branches, and at the metatarsophalangeal articulations they communicate with the corresponding plantar digital artery, through the anterior perforating- branches. The inter- osseous arteries then divide into the dorsal collateral digi- tal vessels which supply adjacent sides of the dorsal surface of the four outer toes. The outer side of the fifth toe be- ing supplied by a small branch from the fourth dorsal inter- osseous artery just before it bifurcates. The Dorsalis Hallucis artery is the continuation of the dorsalis pedis to the metatarsophalangeal joint where it di- vides into two collateral digital branches to the adjacent sides of the first and second toes. The dorsalis hallucis commu- nicates just before its division with the corresponding plan- tar digital artery, and near this point gives off the dorsal collateral digital branch to the inner side of the great toe. This last branch is inconstant. The Communicating Artery. Fig. 125. This is a branch of bifurcation of the dorsalis pedis, and corresponding to the first posterior perforating artery, passes backward through the interval between the first and second metatarsal bones to the sole of the foot, where it completes the plantar arch by anastomosing with the external plantar. It then continues forward as the fifth plantar digital artery, between the first and second toes, receives the anterior per- forating from the dorsalis hallucis, sends a branch to the plantar surface of the inner side of the great toe, and divides into the collateral digital (plantar) branches for the contiguous sides of the first and second toes.

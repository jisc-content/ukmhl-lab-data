The Branches of the Cervical Plexus. (1) The branch to the hypoglossal: After joining the hypoglossal nerve this branch passes with it for a short dis- tance. Some of the fibres continue onward to supply the geniohyoid, thyrohyoid, and anterior belly of the omo- hyoid. The greater part of the fibres leave the hypo- glossal nerve as the descendens hypoglossi^ form a loop below with the (5) communicantes hypoglossi, and supply the posterior belly of the omohyoid, sternohyoid, and sterno- thyroid muscles. (2) The small occipital: This issues at the middle of the posterior border of the sternomastoid muscle along with the superficial cervical and the great auricular, turns upward parallel with this border of the sternomastoid to supply branches to the upper portion of the ear (auricular), to the skin over the mastoid process (mastoid), and to the scalp (occipital). (3) The great auricular : This is found at the middle of the posterior border of the sternomastoid, passes vertically upward to supply the region of the parotid gland (facial), lower back part of the ear (auricular), and the mastoid region (mastoid). (4) The superficial cervical : Comes from the middle of the posterior margin of the sternomastoid, passes forward transversely across the muscle and supplies the platysma, the skin of the antero-lateral region of the neck, and forms a loose plexiform interlacement with the inframaxillary branch of the facial. (5) The communicantes hypoglossi : The branch from the second passes downward, joins that from the third, the

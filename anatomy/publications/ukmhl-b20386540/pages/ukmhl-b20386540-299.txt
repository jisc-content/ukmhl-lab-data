UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 297 There are two veins with the artery, and the interosseous branch of the median nerve. The anterior interosseous artery supplies numerous branches to the adjacent muscles, and one which follows the median nerve and receives its name from this fact. Sometimes this median artery is very large, passes into the palm, and forms the superficial arch with the ulnar. The nutrient arteries for the radius and ulna are from the anterior interosseous artery, (b) The posterior interosseous passes directly backward between the radius and ulna, and will be found in dissecting the back of the arm. (3) The Muscular. These are numerous and supply the muscles near by. (4) Posterior carpal. Is given off just above the wrist- joint, and turns backward under the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris to the back of the hand. (5) The anterior carpal. A small artery to the front of the carpus to supply this region along with the anterior carpal branch of the radial. For the remaining branches in the hand see page 304. The Ulnar Nerve. Fig. 67. Is found entering the forearm from behind the internal condyle of the humerus, then passes between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and descends upon the flexor profundus digitorum. It joins the ulnar artery at the upper and middle thirds of the forearm, continues at the ulnar side of the artery, and with it passes over the anterior annular ligament at the outer side of the pisiform bone into the hand. In the forearm the ulnar nerve supplies filaments to the flexor carpi ulnaris and the inner portion of the flexor pro- fundus digitorum.

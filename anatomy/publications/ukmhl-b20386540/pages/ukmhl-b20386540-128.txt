128 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. THE HEAD AND NECK, Posterior. Landmarks. Fig. 76. In the middle line is the inion—external occipital protu- berance ; outward from that extend the superior curved lines of the occipital bone to the posterior part of the mas- toid processes. Along the middle line of the neck is a depression between the two muscular masses, in which can be felt the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae, especially the last, or vertebra prominens. The ligamentum nuchae lies also in the central depression. The spines of the three or four upper dorsal vertebrae can be felt. The lower limit to the region of the neck is marked by the spine of the scapula and its acromial process. DISSECTION. Incisions.—(i) Continue the median incision (over the top of the head) down the back of the neck to midway between the shoulders. (2) Make a transverse incision out along the spine of the scapula to the point of the shoulder to meet the similar anterior incision. This last incision is the same as number 2, page 360. Remove the integument entirely, being careful not to take off too much of the dense fascia which underlies it. The Superficial Fascia of the back of the neck and thorax. This is a dense layer of brawny fascia, reaching as low down as the middle of the back, and upward into the base of the head. Its fasciculi are very strong and the interstices filled with granular fat. Inflammation beneath this fascia produces very marked effects. Boils and carbuncles find their favorite seat here.

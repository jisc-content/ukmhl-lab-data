A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 112 plying the deep muscles of the neck, and some branches to the interior of the spinal canal, (c) Tracheal, to the trachea. {(T) (^Esophageal, to the oesophagus. {e) The inferior laryngeal, which accompanies the inferior laryngeal nerve into the larynx. The Transverse Cervical Artery. Figs. 17 and 18. It is the second (usually) in size of the branches of the thyroid axis. Its course is as indicated by its name, transversely out- ward across the neck just above the clavicle, to disappear under the trapezius muscle, where it divides into its termi- nal branches. In its outward course it crosses the phrenic nerve, scale- nus anticus, brachial plexus, and scalenus medius ; and is crossed by the omohyoid (posterior belly). Its terminal branches are the {a) superficial cervical, which turns upward under the trapezius to anastomose with the superficial branch of the princeps cervicis of the occipi- tal artery, in its course giving branches to the trapezius, levator anguli scapulae and splenius muscles, between which it lies ; and (U) the posterior scapular, which is usually given off the third portion of the subclavian. If given off the transverse cervical its course is downward and backward under the levator anguli scapulae to the upper angle of the scapula. For the continuation of its course, see page 370. The Suprascapular Artery. Fig. 18. The third and often smallest branch of the thyroid axis. It takes a course outward behind the clavicle to the suprascapular notch, where it crosses above the ligament, which converts this notch into a foramen, the nerve of this name passing-through the foramen. See page 371.

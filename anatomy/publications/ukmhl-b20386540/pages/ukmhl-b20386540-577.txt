THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 575 Hunter's Canal. Figs. 119, 120. This so-called canal is no canal " at all until its contents are removed. It may be described as the angular space between the insertions of the vastus internus on the outside and the adductor longus and magnus muscles on the inside, and reaching from the opening of the adductor magnus upward to the apex of Scarpa's triangle. This angular interval is roofed" over by an aponeurotic membrane extending between the vastus internus and the adductor longus and magnus muscles, and through it passes the femoral artery, vein, and long saphenous nerve, the situation of these structures being from before backward, nerve, artery, and vein. Vastus Bxternus. Figs. 118, 121. Origin.—From the upper half of the anterior intertro- chanteric line, from the front of the great trochanter, from the horizontal line which marks the base of the great tro- chanter, from the outer part of the gluteal ridge (insertion of the gluteus maximus), from the whole length of the outer lip of the linea aspera. Insertion.—Into the upper and outer margins of the patella, and by a strong aponeurosis into the external tuber- osity of the tibia and the deep fascia of the leg. Nerve Supply.—The anterior crural. Action.—To extend the leg, the outward pull of the muscle owing to the obhquity of its lower fibres, resists a corresponding internal traction of the vastus internus. Vastus Internus and Crureus. Figs. 117, 119, 120. Origin.—From the front and sides of the femur for its upper two-thirds (crureus portion), from the lower half of the anterior intertrochanteric line, and its continuation (spiral line) to the linea aspera, from the whole length of

It communicates with the gen- eral peritoneal cavity by means of the opening to the right and behind the gastrohepatic omentum, which in the foetus is a very wide opening, but in the adult the primitive rela- tions have become so altered that this opening will only admit two fingers, and receives the name of the foramen of Winslow. The posterior attachment of the peritoneum in the foetus is, as already stated, in a straight line ; in the adult it is in several lines, none of which are straight. (Diag. 39.) The course in the adult that represents the primitive peritoneal attachment is above, beginning with the falciform ligament of the liver, through the gastrophrenic ligament of the stomach, the gastrosplenic omentum (all that is left of the original mesogaster), then to the attachment of the descending meso- colon, the sigmoid mesentery, and the mesorectum, the last coming back to the middle line in the lower part of its course, all the rest lying to the left of the middle line. The other adult attachments are acquired in the manner already explained. They are for the small intestines and the ascending and transverse colon. The mesenteric at- tachment starts above to the left of the second lumbar ver- tebra and passes downward to the right iliac fossa. From the last point the mesentery for the ascending colon extends upward to the lower border of the thorax, then turns to the right, forming the transverse mesocolon. At the upper end of the ascending colon a band of peritoneum passes off horizontally to be attached to the lateral abdominal wall between the crest of the ilium and the lower border of the thorax. Upon this shelf the right extremity of the liver

Besides the vein there is the internal an- terior thoracic nerve to the inside of the first portion of the artery, the inner cord of the brachial plexus for the second, and the ulnar nerve for the third part. These nerves intervene between the artery and the vein. Also at the inner part of the third portion is the lesser, and the in- ternal cutaneous nerves, and the inner head of the median. On the outside, for the first part, are the cords of the brachial plexus ; for the second part, the outer cord of the same, and the coracoid process ; for the third part, the median and musculocutaneous nerves, the coracobrach- ialis and biceps muscles. Behind the first part is the first intercostal space and muscle, second rib, and second digitation of the serratus magnus muscle, and the posterior thoracic nerve. In the second part, posterior cord and first subscapular nerve^ and the subscapularis muscle. Behind the third part, the mus- culospiral, second and third subscapular and the circum- flex nerves, the subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi muscles. In front of all parts of the artery, the skin, superficial and deep fascia, and the pectoralis major muscle (does not cover the lower part of the artery). In front of the first part, origin of platysma, cephalic and acromio- thoracic artery, veins and branches, external anterior thor- acic nerve, axillary lymphatic trunk and costocoracoid membrane. Over the second part, the pectoralis minor muscle. In front of the third portion, inner head of median, outer brachial vena comes. Branches of the Axillary Artery. First Portion.â€”{a) Superior thoracic. This is a small artery from the inside of the axillary close below the sub- clavius muscle. It passes to the first intercostal space

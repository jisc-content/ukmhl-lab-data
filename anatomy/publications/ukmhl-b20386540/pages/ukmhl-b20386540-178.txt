Further, the lateral margins of the velum become converted into a plexus of capillary vessels, to which the name of choroid plexus is given. These lie within the hollow of the lateral ventricles, but are separated from them by the continuation of the layer of epithelial cells which hnes the velum. These cells cover in all the extensions of the capillary loops. In an exactly similar manner is the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle developed from the portion of the primitive vascular membrane which covers in the roof of the hinder portion of this ventricle. At the adult stage, after the cerebellum has been formed, this vascular layer reaches from the under surface of the cerebellum to the upper surface of the medulla. It is Hned throughout its extent by the attenuated remains of the original roof of this third cerebral vesicle. The layer of cells is applied to the membrane so as to cover in completely (exceptions below) all the festoons of capillaries which have been formed from it. Remember that this portion of the roof of the fourth ventricle is perforated by the foramen of Majendie close to the medulla and in the middle line, and by the foramina of Key and Retzius at its lateral extensions. The Cerebrum. Figs. 24 to 28. The cerebrum consists of the great mass of the brain situated at its anterior and superior part. It is the greatly overgrown forebrain. Its shape is ovoid, flattened below, and partially divided in two symmetrical parts by the great longitudinal fissure. These halves are called hemispheres, right and left.

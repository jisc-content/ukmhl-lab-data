The frontal turns upward at the inner margin of the supra- orbital arch to supply the front of the forehead between the median line and the supra-orbital artery. (See page 26.) The supratrochlear nerve and frontal artery run together. The nasal artery runs downward along the inner part of the eye to the side of the nose, where it anastomoses with the angular branch of the facial. It gives off a small trans- verse branch which, with a similar one from the other side, forms an arch over the front of the base of the nose. The Ophthalmic Veins. The superior is formed at the front of the orbit by the junction of the veins which accompany the frontal and supra- orbital arteries. It passes backward above the optic nerve along with the ophthalmic artery to the sphenoidal fissure, through which it passes to empty into the cavernous sinus. The inferior vein begins at the front of the orbit also, takes a course backward below the optic nerve, and at the back of the orbit empties into the superior ophthalmic vein or separately into the cavernous sinus. The inferior com- municates with the pterygoid plexus through the spheno- maxillary fissure. The Ophthalmic Nerve. Fig. 11. Diags. 3 and 4. This is the first or superior division of the fifth cranial nerve. It is a sensory nerve solely. It enters the orbital

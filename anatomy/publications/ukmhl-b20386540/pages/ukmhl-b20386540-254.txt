252 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The floor of the fourth ventricle is the widely separ- ated internal surface of the pons and medulla. It is tra- versed along the median line by a fissure—the posterior median sulcus. Parallel with the anterior half, and on either side of the posterior median sulcus, is a rounded ridge—the fasciculus teres—which is produced by the fibres of the facial nerve. A small depression is in the lateral recess opposite the posterior part of the eminentia teres, the fovea superior, and in front of this depression is a small bluish spot, the locus caeruleus. Some transverse fibres are seen crossing the floor of the ventricle just behind the lateral recesses ; these are a part of the auditory nerve and are named the striae acusticae. They cross a little elevation, which is the tuberculum acus- ticum. Behind this tubercle is a second shallow depres- sion, which is the fovea inferior. Extending backward and inward from the inferior fovea is the ala cinerea, a dark area over the nuclei of the ninth and tenth nerves. The ventricle narrows to a pointed extremity—the cala- mus scriptorius—which is contained within the clavae of the funiculi graciles. Internal to the ala cinerea is another small elevation, the trigonum hypog'lossi, which is over the nucleus for that nerve. The Posterior and Lateral Surfaces of the Medulla.— Back of the fourth ventricle the sides of the medulla come together, the space between them being called the poste- rior median fissure. By the anterior and posterior median fissures the medulla is divided into two lateral halves ; each half of the medulla is further subdivided by the antero- and posterolateral

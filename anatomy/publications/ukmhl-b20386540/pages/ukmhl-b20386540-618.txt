A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 616 Lisertion.—Into a rough area upon the front of the great trochanter. A small bursa is found between the tendon and the tro- chanter. Nerve Supply.—The superior gluteal; see Gluteus medius, page 605. Action,—The same as the gluteus medius, only in a less degree. It is an abductor of the thigh ; the anterior portion of the muscle rotates the thigh forward (inward), and the pos- terior portion backward (outward). It acts upon the pelvis to keep it level or bring the crest toward the great trochan- ter, also to swing the other side forward, as in walking. The Superior Gluteal Nerve. Fig. 127. This is formed by a branch from the lumbosacral cord and the first sacral nerve. Its course is through the great sacrosciatic foramen above the pyriformis muscle, forward between the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, which it supplies, and terminates in the deep surface of the tensor vaginae femoris muscle (see page 551). DISSECTION, Remove the integument from the back of the leg, following the general directions on page 600 for exposing the thigh. When the heel is reached, cut the skin flap away entirely. The External or Short Saphenous Nerve. Figs. 122, 128. This is formed at the middle of the back of the leg, su- perficial to the deep fascia (the branches which form it having pierced the deep fascia already), by the tibial and fibular communicating cutaneous nerves. It descends along the outer surface of the leg, curves forward below the external malleolus, and runs along the

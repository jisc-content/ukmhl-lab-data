A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 552 branches, one from the lumbosacral cord and the other from the first sacral nerve. It passes out of the pelvis with the gluteal artery, through the great sacrosciatic foramen and above the pyriformis muscle, supplies the gluteus medius and minimus, between which it runs forward to terminate in the tensor vaginae femoris. ib) The inferior g"luteal, formed by filaments from the lumbosacral cord, the first and second sacral nerves, leaves by the same foramen as the above, only below the pyriformis muscle (where it is usually contained in the same sheath with the small sciatic nerve, giv- ing rise to the statement that it is a branch of the small sci- atic), and terminates in the gluteus maximus muscle, (c) The branch to the pyriformis muscle is from the second and third sacral nerves, (d^ The nerve to the quadratus femoris arises from the third sacral nerve, passes through the great sacrosciatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle, descends in front (anterior to) the obturator internus and gemeUi muscles to be distributed to the anterior surface of the quadratus femoris muscle. In its passage over the hip- joint it sends a branch to it. {e) The small sciatic nerve comes from the posterior surface of the second and third sacral nerves, makes its exit from the pelvis through the great sacrosciatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle. For the rest of its course, see page 604. (/) The nerve to the obturator internus arises from the second and third sacral nerves, goes out through the great sacrosciatic fora- men under the pyriformis, re-enters the pelvis through the smaller sacrosciatic foramen, and is distributed to the mus- cle from which it is named, i^g) The internal pudic arises by three roots from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves, takes the same course as the nerve above until the pelvis is re-entered, it then follows along with the internal pudic artery through the canal (Alcock's) beneath the

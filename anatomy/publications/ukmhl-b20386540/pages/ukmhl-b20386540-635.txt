THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. 633 branch to the peroneal under the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, and about an inch above the ankle joint. (5) One or more small internal malleolar branches to the inner side of the ankle. (6) The artery below, which is its largest branch. The Peroneal Artery. Figs. 125, 130. This is a branch from the posterior tibial, about an inch below the lower border of the popliteus muscle ; it turns outward and downward along the fibular side of the leg, lying deeply placed between the tibialis posticus and flexor longus hallucis, or else under the latter. About three inches above the ankle joint it gives off the anterior pero- neal and then continues under the name of the posterior peroneal to behind the external malleolus, where it breaks up into several terminal branches to the outer and back part of the os calcis. There are two accompanying veins. Branches of the Peroneal Artery, (i) Muscular branches to the adjacent muscles. (2) A nutrient artery to the fibula, in the middle and lower thirds of the leg. (3) The anteidor peroneal. This artery is given off about three inches above the ankle joint, passes forward between the tibia and fibula and through the inter- osseous membrane to the front of the leg, then turns down- ward to supply the outer part of the front of the ankle. See page 594. (4) The communicating branch (or branches), anastomoses with the posterior tibial across the lower end of the tibia. See Posterior Tibial, (5) The cutaneous branches to the integument upon the outer side of the leg. (6) The external calcanean, supplies the parts at the outer side of the os calcis. This with the small terminal branches of the peroneal anastomose about the ankle with the external malleolar, anterior peroneal, tarsal

THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 529 Nerve Supply,—Filaments from the last dorsal and upper lumbar nerves. Action.—A lateral flexor of the spine. By fixing the last rib it gives the diaphragm a firm point for contraction and so aids inspiration. DISSECTION. Trace the branches of the lumbar nerves through the psoas muscle. The Last Dorsal Nerve. Figs. 105, 106, 107. Courses outward and downward just below the lower border of the last rib, crossing the quadratus lumborum, to disappear through the lumbar fascia, and enter between the transversalis and internal obHque muscles, where it divides into two branches. The anterior branch continues to the rectus and pyra- midalis muscles, the lateral or iliac pierces the internal and external oblique muscles about three inches above the crest of the ilium and turns downward to supply the integument over the crest of the ilium in front of and as low down as the great trochanter. The Lumbar Plexus. Figs. 103 to 107. The lumbar plexus is formed by the anterior divisions of the first four lumbar nerves and a branch from the last dorsal. From the fourth lumbar nerve a branch descends to join the fifth (anterior) division, and the trunk thus formed passes to the upper margin of the sacral plexus as the lumbosacral cord. The lumbosacral cord lies between the inner border of the psoas muscle and the base of the sacrum, and behind the iliac vessels. The lumbar nerves are connected to the sympathetic ganglia by slender filaments. 34

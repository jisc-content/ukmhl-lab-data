UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, POSTERIOR. 385 Extensor Indicis. Fig. 79. Origin.—From the posterior surface of the ulna and the interosseous membrane just below the extensor longus pol- licis. Insertion.—Into the tendon of the common extensor for the index finger. Nerve Supply.—Same as the above. Action.—To extend the index finger and hand. Supinator Brevis. Figs. 67, 79. Origin.—By the common tendon from the external (epi) condyle of the humerus, from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint, from the orbicular ligament, from the ridge and triangular surface of bone below the lesser sig- moid cavity of the ulna, from the intermuscular septa. Insertion.—Into the upper third of the radius from its neck to the insertion of the pronator radii teres below, and limited by the oblique hne in front. Nerve Supply.—The posterior interosseous, which passes through the muscle from the front to the back of the fore- arm. (The fibres come from the sixth cervical nerve.) Action.—To supinate the forearm. The Posterior Interosseous Artery. (See page 297.) Fig. 79. This is a branch from the common interosseous in the anterior part of the forearm. It turns backward, passing between the radius and ulna on either side, and the interos- seous membrane below, and the oblique Hgament above, and appears in the posterior part of the forearm between the supinator brevis and the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis muscles. It descends between the deep and superficial layers of muscles until just above the wrist it terminates in branches which anastomose with the anterior interosseous 25

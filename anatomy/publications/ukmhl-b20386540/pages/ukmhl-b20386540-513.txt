511 THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. The gastroduodenalis will be seen to divide into two branches : the right g-astro-epiploic, which courses along the greater curvature of the stomach to unite with the left gastro-epiploic ; and the superior pancreaticoduodenalis, which, descending in the interval between the duodenum and the head of the pancreas, supplies both and finally an- astomoses with the inferior pancreaticoduodenalis from the superior mesenteric. Both gastro-epiploic arteries supply the stomach and send off long slender branches to the omentum, which follow backward to meet similar branches from the colic arteries. These branches are the epiploic. The Superior Mesenteric Artery. Figs. I02, 105. Will be found coming out between the pancreas and third portion of the duodenum, arising from the front of the aorta. It gives off the inferior pancreaticoduodenalis, which turns to the left between the pancreas and the duo- denum, supplying both, and terminating by anastomosing with the superior artery of the same name. DISSECTION. Let the stomach and Hver drop back into the abdomen. Raise the great omentum and transverse colon upward on to the chest and fasten them there. Dissect off the presenting layer of the peritoneum from the superior mesenteric artery and its branches. It will not be necessary to clean all the intestinal branches to their distribution ; clean their origin, and trace two or three, with their anastomoses, to the smaH intestine. It will be necessary to follow all the other branches coming off the right side of the mesenteric. They are the ileocolic, the right, and middle colic. The superior mesenteric artery arises from the front of the aorta (as previously discovered), above the transverse duodenum and below the pancreas. It takes a curved direction downward and to the right iliac fossa. (a) Its first branch is the inferior pancreaticoduodenaHs,

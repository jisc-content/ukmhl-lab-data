A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 198 All these structures are located in the area contained between the temporal lobes laterally, the pons posteriorly, and the frontal lobes anteriorly. This space is called the interpeduncular space. Within it the Circle of Willis has already been found, page i6i. The lamina cinerea, optic chiasm, tuber cinereum, infundi- bulum, and posterior perforated space all take part in form- ing the floor of the third ventricle of the brain. The Superficial Origin of the Cranial Nerves, I. The Olfactory. Figs. 21, 28, 29, 9, 13. The olfactory nerve, as described, is really not a nerve but an aborted offset from the foetal forebrain. Its central cavity, which is at first in communication with the cavity of the forebrain, becomes obliterated as develop- ment proceeds. Diag. 14. The nerve consists of four portions : the roots (of which there are three), the tract, the bulb, and the olfactory nerves proper. The three roots may be traced, one externally (which passes to the amygdaloid nucleus in the anterior part of the roof of the descending horn of the lateral ven- tricle), a middle (which terminates by connecting with the fibres of the anterior commissure within the substance of the corpus striatum), and the internal (which passes to the anterior part of the gyrus fornicatus). The tract is a slender, triangular-shaped bundle which passes forward from the roots and terminates in an expanded extremityâ€”the bulb. Both lie within the olfactory sulcus of the frontal lobe. The olfactory bulb rests upon the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and the olfactory nerves proper pass down- ward through the foramina in that plate to the mucous membrane of the nose.

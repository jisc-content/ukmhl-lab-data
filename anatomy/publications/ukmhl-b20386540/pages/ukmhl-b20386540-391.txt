Diagram of the Insertion of the Lumbricales and Interossei Muscles into the Aponeurotic Tendon of the Extensor Communis Digi- torum, to Illustrate their Double Action as Flexors of the First Phalanges AND Extensors of the Last Two Sets of Phalanges. (/. 6". H,^ are attached. This action is in common with the palmar set of interossei and the lumbricales. The distinctive action of the dorsal set of muscles is abduction of the fingers from a line through the middle finger. THE SPINAL CORD. DISSECTION. The dissection of the spinal cord is not practicable in the usual dissecting- room subject, for the cord is so soft that its gross structure cannot be deter- mined. A perfectly fresh subject that has been injected as soon as received, or a "pickled subject" that has been preserved with a zinc injection and a hard- ening preservative solution, is to be selected. If the brain has been removed as previously described, the dissection can be continued by cleaning out all the mass of muscles which fill in the spinal gutters from the base of the skull to the end of the sacrum. Clean the spi- nous processes, laminae, and articular processes, noting the ligaments of these parts of the spine.

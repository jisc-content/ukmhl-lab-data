The brain receives its supply of blood through the inter- nal carotids and vertebral arteries. After entering the skull through the foramen lacerum medium the inte^^nal carotid aj'iery passes forward through the cavernous sinus as given on page 43. At the anterior part of the sinus the artery turns upward through the dura, behind and internal to the anterior clinoidal process, and reaches the base of the brain at the beginning of the fissure of Sylvius, where it divides into the anterior and middle cerebral vessels. The vertebrals, after entering the skull through the foramen magnum, are found at the side of the medulla. They converge as they pass forward and unite in the middle line at the junction of the pons and medulla to form the basilar artery. The basilar artery runs forward in a median depression in the pons to its anterior margin, where it divides into the two posterior cerebral vessels. The Circle of Willis. Figs. 21 and 22. The anterior cerebral arteries pass forward and inward to the beginning of the great longitudinal fissure, which they enter. They continue upward and backward over the corpus callosum, distributing branches to the inner surface of the hemisphere as far as the parieto-occipital fissure (where the terminal branches anastomose with similar branches from the posterior cerebral arteries). At the beginning of the great longitudinal fissure the anterior cerebral vessels are united by a very short artery

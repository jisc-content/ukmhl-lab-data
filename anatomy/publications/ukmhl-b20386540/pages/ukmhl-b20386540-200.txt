A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 200 The cortical centre of smell is located in the uncinate convolution, hippocampus major, and the pes hippocampi. 2. The Optic Nerve. Figs. 21, 28, 29, 38, 53, 54, 10, II, 12. This passes forward from the optic commissure or chiasm to enter the optic foramen in company with the ophthalmic artery, the latter being external and inferior to the nerve. See page 57. The optic chiasm is the junction of the two optic tracts at the middle of the base of the brain ; it lies in front of the tuber cinereum and rests upon the optic groove of the sphenoid bone. The optic tracts extend backward and outward from the optic chiasm, winding around the crura cerebri and under cover of the temporal lobes. At a later stage of the dis- section the optic tracts will be found to arise from the external geniculate body, the pulvinar of the optic thala- mus, and the anterior of the corpora quadrigemina (the ex- ternal arm) ; and from the internal geniculate body and the posterior of the corpora quadrigemina (the internal root). The cortical centre of sight is in the cuneate convolution of the occipital lobe. 3. The Motor Oculi. Figs. 21, 29, 38, 10, il. This nerve issues from the inner side of a crus cerebri, close to the pons, passes forward through the cavernous sinus, and leaves the skull through the sphenoidal fissure. See page 57. (Its deep origin is from a nucleus in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius, and its cortical representation is in the convolutions about the lower extremity of the fissure of Rolando.)

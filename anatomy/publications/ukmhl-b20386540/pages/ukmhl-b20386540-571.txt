THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 5G9 upper part of the thigh. It is formed by the sartorius muscle upon the outside, the adductor longus on the inside, and Poupart's ligament above, which forms the base of the triangle. The ''floor" of the space is formed from without in- ward by the lower portion of the iliacus, the tendon of the psoas magnus, the pectineus, the adductor longus, and (in thin people) the adductor brevis muscles. The triangle is crossed from the middle of the base to the apex at the junction of the sartorius and adductor longus by the femoral vessels and the anterior crural nerve and its branches. The relations of these structures under Poupart's liga- ment is nerve, artery, and vein from without inward. Internal to the vein is the femoral opening or canal. See below, also page 525. At the apex of the triangle the vein turns backward so as to lie nearly behind the artery, while the branches of the nerve are to the outside of and in front of the vessels. The triangle is covered by the fascia lata, the two layers of the superficial fascia, and the integument. The Femoral Canal Is the space left within the femoral sheath (at the inside of the femoral vein, between the vein and Gimbernat's ligament and the conjoined tendon). There is no canal unless made by the descent of a femoral hernia or by the dissector. When a femoral hernia develops it leaves the abdomen through the femoral opening at the inner side of the terminus of the external iliac vein, descends along the inside of the femoral vein, and makes its appearance through the saphenous opening.

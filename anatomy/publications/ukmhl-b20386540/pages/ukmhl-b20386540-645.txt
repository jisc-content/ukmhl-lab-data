THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR. 643 a junction with the communicating branch of the dorsal pedis and so completes the plantar arch. The artery is accompanied by two venae comites and the external plantar nerve. Branches of the External Plantar Artery. (1) Muscular, numerous small branches to the near-by muscles. (2) Calcanean (internal), two or three branches to the inner side of the os calcis. (3) Cutaneous, to the integument along the outer border of the sole. (4) Anastomotic, pass over the outer border of the foot to anastomose with the external malleolar, tarsal and meta- tarsal branches upon the dorsum of the foot. All these branches come off the artery before it turns inward to form the plantar arch. From the plantar arch arise the following : (5) Articular, pass backward to the joints of the tarsus. (6) Posterior perforating, three, which ascend through the back part of the three outer interosseous spaces and anastomose on the dorsum of the foot with the dorsal in- terosseous arteries (branches of the metatarsal artery. See page 596). (7) Digital branches. Four in number ; arise from the front of the arch, (a) The first digital, from the beginning of the arch at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, to the outer side of the little toe, crossing in its course the flexor brevis, and the adductor minimi digiti muscles, {h) (c) and (d^ The second, third, and fourth digital arteries pass forward upon the interossei muscles through the mid- dle of the fourth, third and second interosseous spaces to the web of the toes where each divides into two collateral digital branches to the adjacent sides of the toes, {e) (/)

568 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. nerve crosses over the front of the artery from its outer to its inner side. Leaving the femoral artery, when it turns backward through the opening in the adductor magnus, the nerve continues downward between the tendons of the sartorius (in front) and the gracilis (behind) and becomes superficial just below the inner side of the knee joint. Here it joins the internal saphenous vein, which it accom- panies along the inner side of the leg to the ankle, and terminates a short distance below the internal malleolus. While under cover of the sartorius muscle the internal saphenous nerve gives off the patellar branch which pierces the sartorius and runs downward and forward to the front of the knee. It supplies the integument over the inner side of the knee, leg, and ankle. The Nerve to the Pectineus Muscle. This is a small but constant branch given off from the anterior crural just under Poupart's ligament. It passes downward and inward behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, with which it is closely united to the front of the pectineus muscle. The Muscular Branches of the Anterior Crural. Figs. 117, 119, 120. They are distributed to the sartorius (usually from the mid- dle cutaneous), rectus femoris, vastus externus and internus, crureus, and pectineus muscles. The hip joint receives a branch from the nerve to the rectus. The articular branches to the knee joint are filaments from the branches to the rectus, vasti, and crureus muscles, which passing onward through the muscles terminate in the upper part of the capsule and synovial membrane of the knee joint.

442 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Deep Vessels and Nerves of the Penis.â€”The arteries are from the internal pudic, page 412. Nerves from the internal pudic nerve, page 414. The Dorsal Vein of the Penis. (Usually single, may be double.) This emerges from a venous plexus which surrounds the glans penis, passes backward along the dorsum of the penis between the two dorsal arteries, receives in this part of its course large branches from the body of the penis which emerge from between the corpus spongiosum and the corpora cavernosa and wind around the side of the penis to enter the dorsal vein. Continuing backward, the vein penetrates the suspensory ligament of the penis, then passes through the opening in the triangular ligaments close to the under surface of the pubic arch, divides into two branches which terminate in the prostatic plexus. Before passing through the triangular ligaments the dorsal vein sends communicating branches to the internal pudic veins. See page 413. Within the pelvis it com- municates with the obturator vein. DISSECTION. Divide the elastic sheath of the penis along the median line, separating the corpora cavernosa from each other, and from the corpus spongiosum. Consult the descriptions of these structures as already given on pages 414, 416. Leave the corpus spongiosum attached by the membranous urethra to the prostate and bladder, keep them covered with a damp cloth until such time as the bladder has been dissected and the urethra can be opened from end to end. Incise the skin of the scrotum along the median raphe, and reflect it. Identify the dartos and its connections with the superficial abdominal fascia, then reflect it like the integument. Remove the testicle from the scrotum. The various covering's of the cord and testicle (Fig. 93) are those that are derived from the several layers of the

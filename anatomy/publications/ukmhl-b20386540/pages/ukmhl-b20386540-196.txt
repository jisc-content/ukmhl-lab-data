A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 196 brain, or the crura cerebri. They are joined together at their line of contact along the middle line. A short distance posteriorly the crura are crossed by the transverse fibres of the pons, which pass across the crura to connect the two halves of the cerebellum and form its middle peduncles. Along the middle line the pons is marked by a shallow groove in which rests the basilar artery. (The pons really does not bear upon the artery at all, but upon the cerebro- spinal fluid within the subarachnoid spaces, which form, as stated, a water-bed " for its support.) The longitudinal fibres issue from the posterior part of the pons, and from this point to the margin of the foramen mag- num constitute the medulla. A full description of these structures will appear later. The Central Parts at the Base of the Cerebrum.â€”Begin- ning in front, in the anterior part of the g'reat longitudinal fissure which separates the frontal lobes the under surface of the anterior part of the corpus callosum will be seen {this is the rostrtmi). The extension of the floor of the cerebrum backward from the corpus callosum to the crossing of the optic nerves is in the shape of a thin lamella of grey matter called the lamina cinerea. The lamina cinerea becomes continuous lat- erally with the anterior perforated spaces, and posteriorly with the tuber cinereum. On either sides of the lamina cinerea and in the angle between the temporal and frontal lobes are the anterior perforated spaces, small areas of the base, where the small arteries of the anterolateral gangli- onic systems enter the corpus striatum. The anterior per- forated space is really the under surface of the lenticular nucleus of the corpus striatum. From the sides of the corpus callosum a narrow band of

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 257 By raising the arm half way to a right angle from the body, the anterior and posterior boundaries of the axillary space will appear, the pectoralis major in front and the latissimus dorsi behind. Between them is the cavity of the axilla. By carrying the fingers high up in this cavity the head of the humerus can be felt. The line of the axillary artery : Extend the arm until it is at right angles with the trunk, then draw a line from the middle of the clavicle to the depression at the inner border of the coracobrachialis and biceps muscles. The pectoral border leads down to the fifth rib. To count the ribs, remember that the second rib joins the sternum (through its cartilage) at the articulation be- tween the first and second pieces of the sternum ; that the seventh at the junction of the second and third parts of the sternum ; that the fourth rib is just above, and the fifth just below the nipple; that the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth can be located by touch along the lower border of the thorax. The arm presents a prominence in front due to the bi- ceps muscle, and a slight depression at its outer and inner margins ; in the outer lies the cephalic vein and in the inner the brachial artery, and veins with the median nerve. The inner margin of the muscle is the guide to the artery. A similar prominence is upon the back of the arm, formed by the triceps muscle. At the elbow recognize the two (epi) condyles of the humerus, the olecranon process of the ulna, and the head and tuberosity of the radius. The internal (epi) condyle, being more prominent than the external, is more often broken off than the external. It points in the direction to which the head of the humerus faces. The prominent olecranon behind bears certain relations 17

592 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. Extensor Brevis Dig'itorum. Fig. 124. Origiit.—FYom the outer and upper surface of the fore part of the os calcis, from the external calcaneo-astragaloid ligament, and from the lower band of the anterior annular ligament. Insertion,—By four tendons. The first tendon is inserted into the outer surface of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe ; the rest of the tendons merge into the outer margins of the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum (just over the bases of the first phalanges), and by them are attached to the second and third phalanges. Nerve Supply.—The anterior tibial. Action.—To extend and adduct (toward the middle line of the second toe) the first phalanx of the great toe, to ex- tend the third, second, and first phalanges of the next three toes. The action of the muscle upon the toes is more upon the distal than the proximal segments of them. Dorsal Interossei. Fig. 125. There are four dorsal interossei muscles. There is one on either side of the second toe ; then the third and fourth toes have each a muscle upon their outer (fibular) side. Oidgin.—From the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones between which they lie. Between the two heads pass the posterior perforating arteries. (In the case of the first mus- cle it is the communicating artery.) Insertion.—Into the bases of the first phalanges, and into the lateral margins of the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum ; upon the inner side of the second toe for the first muscle, and upon the outer side of the second, third, and fourth toes for the remaining muscles. Nerve Supply.—The external plantar branch of the pos- terior tibial nerve.

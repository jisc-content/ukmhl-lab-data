The frontal lobe presents three well-marked tertiary fissures : the superior and inferior—or first and second frontal sulci—which run anteroposteriorly, and the pre- central, which is at right angles to the above, and irregu- larly parallel to the fissure of Rolando. The last fissure is usually interrupted in its course, and the anteroposterior sulci may terminate in it; the superior usually does. These sulci divide the frontal lobe into four convolu- tions : The ascending" frontal, which lies parallel with and in front of the fissure of Rolando, and is limited in front by the precentral fissure. The superior frontal convolu- tion, which becomes continuous on the inner surface with the marginal convolution, on the inferior surface with the inter- nal convolution, and behind with the ascending frontal convo- lution. The middle frontal convolution, between the superior and inferior frontal sulci, is extended around to the inferior surface of the frontal lobe, and backward to the pre- central sulcus, by which it is separated from the ascending frontal convolution. On the under surface of the lobe this convolution merges into the middle or the anterior convolu- tion. The inferior frontal or Broca's convolution is below the inferior sulcus, arches over the vertical limb of the Sylvian fissure, and becomes continuous behind with the ascending frontal, and on the under surface of the frontal lobe with the posterior orbital convolutions. This convolu- tion is deeply indented on its under surface by the vertical limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and above by the precentral sulcus. The internal and inferior surfaces will be described on pages 188 and 192.

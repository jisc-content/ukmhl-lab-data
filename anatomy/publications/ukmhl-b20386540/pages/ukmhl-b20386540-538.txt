A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 536 by the gap in the upper margin of the obturator membrane. It is accompanied in its course by the artery of the same name if it is a branch from the internal iliac. In the thigh the nerve issues from the obturator canal above or through the upper part of the obturator externus muscle, where it divides into two branches. The anterior branch descends between the pectineus and adductor longus in front and the adductor brevis behind, supplying these muscles and terminating in the gracilis. It also sends a cutaneous branch to the lower and inner third of thigh. The posterior h^ajtch goes behind the adductor brevis and supplies the adductor magnus, continues downward, pierces the adduc- tor magnus just above the femoral opening, joins the pop- liteal vessels, and ends in the posterior part of the knee- joint. The obturator externus receives its nerve supply from the posterior division of the nerve. A filament is also sent to the hip-joint. (7) The obturator accessory. When present arises from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. Descends between the psoas and internal iliac artery (behind both) over the anterior border of the pubes to the pectineus, which it sup- plies, then communicates with the obturator nerve and con- tinues to the hip-joint. DISSECTION. Inflate the bladder. Dissect the peritoneum from it and the rectum. Clean the internal iliac vessels and their branches, also the sacral plexus. In doing this notice the pelvic fascia, the so-called " white line," and the rectovesical fascia. To dissect the pelvic cavity and viscera requires that the lateral wall shall be removed from one side as represented in the plates ; as this destroys the side removed for dissection of the gluteal region, it is not practicable, and the dis- sector must do the best possible with the pelvis intact. Trace the ureters, vasa deferentia, and expose the seminal vesicles. In

72 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. The superficial veins (jugular) of the neck are to be dissected, their forma- tion, course, and termination determined as far as possible.

The temporal and internal maxillary veins unite opposite the neck of the lower jaw to form the temporomaxillary sinus (or vein). Diag. 5.

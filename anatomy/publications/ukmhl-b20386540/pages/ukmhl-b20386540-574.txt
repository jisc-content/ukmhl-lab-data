572 A MANUAL OF AAATOMY. adductor brevis muscle appears between the pectineus and adductor longus. The artery is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, fascia lata, and is crossed by some small cutaneous nerve filaments and veins. Hunter's Canal.—See page 575. In its passage through this triangular shaped canal the femoral artery lies between the vastus internus on the outside, the adductor longus and magnus on the inside, and beneath the aponeurotic membrane which unites these muscles. The femoral vein accompanies the artery, being placed behind and internal to the artery at the upper part of the canal, and behind and slightly external to the artery at the opening in the adductor magnus. The internal saphenous nerve also passes through the canal with the artery and crosses it from the outside to the inside ; it leaves the artery at the lower part of the canal by passing in front of the tendon of the adductor magnus muscle, while the artery passes through the opening in the same. In front of the artery (in addition to the aponeurotic covering and the internal saphenous nerve) are the sartorius muscle, the fasciae, and integument. The Branches of the Femoral Artery. (1) The superficial epigastric. See page 436. This is a small branch from the front of the femoral just below Poupart's ligament. It pierces the fascia lata, then turns upward and inward on to the abdomen to ramify in the subcutaneous tissue as high as the umbilicus. (2) The superficial circumflex iliac.—This is another small branch from the superficial epigastric, or from the femoral close to it. It passes through the fascia lata, runs outward just below Poupart's ligament and breaks up into branches which supply the superficial tissues about the

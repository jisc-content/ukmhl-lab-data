A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 488 dividing the gland into the right (larger) and left (smaller) lobes. (2) In the free margin of the suspensory, is the round ligament, a fibrous cord representing the umbilical vein. It extends from the umbiHcus to the under surface of the liver, and disappears in the umbilical fissure. (3) Extending from side to side, at right angles to, and continuous with, the suspensory ligament, is the coronary ligament. (4, 5) The extreme ends of the coronary ligament are called the right and left lateral ligaments. Relations,—The liver will be seen to be in relation with the following organs. (Not all will appear at this stage, but as before remarked, they are given here consecutively, and later may be confirmed or disproved):— Above, the upper surface lies against the diaphragm. Below, the lower surface comes in contact with the hepatic flexure of the colon, gall bladder (part of the Hver), stomach (cardiac and pyloric ends and anterior surface), the first and second parts of the duodenum, the right kidney, and the gastrohepatic omentum. Behind, the dia- phragm and its crura, the tenth and eleventh dorsal verte- brae, the oesophagus, the aorta (separated from the liver by the diaphragm), vena cava, and the right suprarenal body. Surfaces, Lobes, and Fissures.—(i) The upper sur- face is convex to fit in the concavity of the diaphragm, and is divided by the suspensory ligament into the right and left lobes. (2) The lower surface is generally concave, and is sepa- rated from the posterior by the transverse fissure. Into the transverse fissure pass the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic nerves, coming out of the hepatic duct. The right lobe is divided from the left, by the longi-

In front of the fissure of Rolando there is an offset from the callosomarginal sulcus which serves to bound anteriorly the paracentral convolution. Also, the direction of the main part of the sulcus is continued posteriorly nearly to the parieto-occipital fissure under the name of the subparietal sulcus. This sulcus is often not distinctly marked. The curved portion of cerebral matter external to the callosomarginal sulcus belongs to the frontal lobe and is called the marg-inal convolution. As above stated, the portion of the marginal lobe which connects the ascending frontal and parietal convolutions is called the paracentral convolution. The square-shaped mass between the upturned extremity of the callosomarginal sulcus and the parieto-occipital fissure is the quadrate lobe, or convolution. It is the internal portion of the parietal lobe and is limited inferiorly by the subparietal sulcus. Between the posterior portion of the parieto-occipital and the calcarine fissures is the triangular or wedge-shaped convolution—the cuneus—which is the internal part of the occipital lobe. The marginal, quadrate, and cuneate con- volutions form the outer arch of the internal surface of the hemisphere. Internal to this outer arch of convolutions is a second arch, which starts beneath the anterior extremity of the corpus callosum, curves backward over that structure, being separated from it by the callosal sulcus, then turns around the hinder extremity of the corpus callosum, and under the name of the uncinate convolution extends forward to the end of the temporal lobe.

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 258 to the condyles of the humerus in the normal state that must be kept in mind :— (1) When the forearm is extended on the arm, the top of the olecranon and the two condyles are all in the same straight line. (2) If the forearm is flexed to a right angle with the arm, the condyles and the tip of the olecranon are in the same plane. The coronoid process of the ulna may be found in front of the inner part of the elbow on deep pres- sure. It is usually not easily distinguished. The head of the radius will be felt, on rotation of the shaft, three- fourths of an inch below the external condyle. The '^carrying angle : " This is the normal angle (10*^) formed by the arm and the supinated forearm ; its opening is out- ward. It is produced by the trochlear surface of the humerus being prolonged lower on the inside than outside and thus throwing the lower end of the ulna outward. The angle may be lost in fractures involving the condyles of the humerus and should always be restored; if not maintained, a peculiar deformity—gun-stock—remains. The shafts of the ulna and radius terminate below in their respective styloid processes. Demonstrate that the styloid process of the radius is about one-fourth of an inch lower than that of the ulna. If this relation is altered so as to bring the processes in the same line it shows that a fracture of one or the other bones has occurred. In the reduction of the usual (Colles's) fracture of the wrist see that the normal relation is reproduced. Outlining the Heart and Lung's. Figs. 57, 58, 59. The student now should take time to mark out the super- ficial outlines of the heart, lungs, and great vessels upon the exterior of the chest. The relations of the heart given below are the results of the writer's own investigations in

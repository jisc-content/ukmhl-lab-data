This is a dense shiny layer of fascia lying under the apo- neurosis of the occipitofrontalis, and covering in the tem- poral muscle. It is attached to the outermost ridge of the temporal fossa, from the external angular process of the frontal to the posterior root of the zygomatic arch behind, and below to the zygomatic arch in two layers, one to the inner and one to the outer border of its upper margin. Between these layers is found a little fat, the orbital branch of the temporal artery, and the temporal branch of the temporomalar nerve (of the superior maxillary). Temporal. Fig. 4.

THE BRAIN. 163 cerebrals external to where the posterior communicating enter, supply the posterior part of the optic thalamus, crura cerebri, and the corpora quadrigemina. (6) The posteromedian group. Arise from the posterior communi- cating and posterior cerebrals, enter the brain (producing the posterior perforated space), and supply the optic thalami. Other branches not supplying the basal ganglia :â€” (i) The anterior choroid, a small branch from the back part of the internal carotid or the middle cerebral, runs back- ward, enters the lower part of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle through the transverse fissure, and supplies the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricle, hippocampus major, and corpus fimbriatum. (2) The posterior choroid, from the posterior cerebral, supplies the upper part of the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles. The Cortical System. (1) The anterior cerebral takes a course forward and in- ward from the internal carotid, enters the great longitudinal fissure, through which it passes backward, lying close to the corpus callosum, as far as the parieto-occipital fissure. The anterior cerebral gives off three sets of cortical branches, which supply the under, inner, and outer surface (first and part of the second frontal convolutions) of the frontal lobe and the quadrate convolution of the parietal lobe. (2) The middle cerebral. This is the larger artery, into which the internal carotid bifurcates at the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius. The artery passes outward, backward, and upward through the Sylvian fissure, until opposite the lower end of the fissure of Rolando, where it divides into four branches, which supply the greater part of the outer surface of the cerebrum. The ganglionic branches of the middle cerebral are of the

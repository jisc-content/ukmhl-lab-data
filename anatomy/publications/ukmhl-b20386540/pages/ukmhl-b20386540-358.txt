A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 356 only of the two layers of the endothelium of the vessel. These thin places admit of a closer apposition of the valves. The sinuses of Valsalva are hollows behind each cusp of the semilunar valves (whether in pulmonary artery or the aorta). The sinuses are arranged in the pulmonary artery with two in front (the left is slightly in front of the right) and one in the rear. In the aorta these sinuses are arranged with one in front and two behind. See Coro7tmy Arteries, pages 352 and 353. The inner surface of the ventricle is corrugated by mus- cular ridges, the columnae carnese. These are found in three forms : one, attached by their whole lengths ; a second, by both ends ; a third, by one end (musculi papillares), the other end being free and affording attachment to the chordae tendinese. The chordae tendineae are fibrous strings passing from the musculi papillares to the under surface and free borders of the primary and secondary por- tions of the tricuspid (and bicuspid) valve. The Left Ventricle.â€”This ventricle is about three times thicker than the right one. From it extends the aorta, and into it empties the left auricle through the auriculoventri- cular opening. The aortic opening is provided with semi- lunar valves and the auriculoventricular with the bicuspid (mitral) valve, similar in every way to the semilunar and tricuspid of the right ventricle. The auriculoventricular or bicuspid valve is com- posed of two main and two secondary flaps. Behind the semilunar valves the aortic wall is pouched ; these pouches are called the sinuses of Valsalva, as above described. The Trachea. Figs. 18, 70, 71, 72. Diags. 20, 21.

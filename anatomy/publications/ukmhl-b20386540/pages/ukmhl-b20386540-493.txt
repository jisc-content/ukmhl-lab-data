THE ABDOMEN, INTERIOR. 491 The anterior border is thin and sharp, and is notched at the umbilical fissure. To the right of this notch is the fundus of the gall bladder. If distended it will project beyond the liver border. The g'all bladder (Figs. 104, 105) is a membranous sac situated in the fissure of that name, used as a reservoir for the bile. Its duct is the cystic duct which unites with the hepatic to form the common bile duct. (For the course of the latter see Gastrohepatic Omentum.^ It must be remembered that in living, healthy people the relations of the abdominal organs to each other and to the surface of the body varies from time to time with respira- tion, position of the body and fullness of the stomach, and that in disease the variations are innumerable. Conse- quently, all measurements are only relative, and true for the subject and at that particular time. However, if our measurements are not exactly correct they serve to give us standards from which to note variations. Hence, the need that every student should investigate for himself the rela- tions of the subject he is at work upon, without reference to the text-book figures ; later he should make the compari- son between his data and that in the text-books. The Sinface Area of Liver Projection. Figs. 96, 98, 108, 109.â€”The upper border oi the Hver is represented by a line, beginning two and one-half inches at the left of the median line on a level with the sixth left sternochondral articulation, and drawn slightly downward to cross the sternum at the sternoxiphoid articulation, then toward the right, curved slightly upward, to reach a point one inch below the right nipple ; from here the line is carried directly around the chest to end at the eighth dorsal vertebra. The lozver liver border is traced by an oblique line start- ing at the left over the eighth costal cartilage (a very indefi-

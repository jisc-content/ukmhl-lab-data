594 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. hallucis and the tibialis anticus for the lower third of the leg. The Branches of the Anterior Tibial. (1) The posterior tibial recurrent. This is found when dissecting the back of the leg. It runs upward between the popliteus muscle and the posterior ligament of the knee joint. It is a small branch and often wanting. (2) The anterior tibial recurrent. This is a branch of considerable size that runs upward through the origin of the tibialis anticus close to the bone, and supplies the outer side of the front of the knee, anastomosing with the ex- ternal inferior and superior articular from the popliteal and the long articular branch of the external circumflex to the outer side of the knee. (3) The muscular branches are numerous and supply the muscles bordering upon the artery. (4) The malleolar. The external is slightly larger than the internal. They pass to the external and internal mal- leolar regions, which they supply ; in their course they run beneath the tendons of the muscles at either side of the anterior tibial artery. The internal malleolar forms an anÂ» astomosis with the posterior tibial, internal plantar, and the internal calcanean ; the external, with the anterior pe- roneal, the external plantar, and the tarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis. The Anterior Peroneal. See page 633. Fig. 125. It is found as it appears through the interosseous mem- brane, between the tibia and the fibula, about two or three inches above the ankle joint. It passes downward between the two bones of the leg to the front of the outer side of the ankle, which it supplies, and where it enters into an anastomosis with the external malleolar artery.

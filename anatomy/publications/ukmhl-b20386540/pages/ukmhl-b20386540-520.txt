A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 518 The right artery passes behind the vena cava, and is a little longer than the left. (7) The rig'ht and left spermatic. Each is a long, slender artery that passes with the spermatic cord through the in- ternal abdominal ring, the inguinal canal, and external ring to the scrotum as far as the testicle, which it supplies. The artery Hes behind the peritoneum, and joins the cord (vas deferens) just before the internal abdominal ring is reached. In the female the artery is the ovarian, and supplies the ovary and uterus. It has the same origin, and course until it enters the broad ligament and passes to supply the ovary and uterus. (8) The right and left second lumbar arteries. See below. (9) The inferior mesenteric. See page 512. (10) The right and left third lumbar. See below. (11) The right and left fourth lumbar. The lumbar arteries arise from the posterior surface of the aorta, opposite the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, pass outward beneath the origin of the psoas, then behind the quadratus lumborum, finally between the transversalis and internal oblique, and are distributed to the abdominal wall as far forward as the rectus muscle, anastomosing with the other abdominal arteries. (12) The right and left common iliacs. See below. (13) The sacra media. This small artery arises from the posterior surface of the aorta just above its bifurcation, passes down in front of the middle of the sacrum to the coccyx. It anastomoses with the sacral branches from in- ternal iliac arteries. The Common Iliac Arteries. Figs. 103 to 107 They extend from the bifurcation of the aorta, at the

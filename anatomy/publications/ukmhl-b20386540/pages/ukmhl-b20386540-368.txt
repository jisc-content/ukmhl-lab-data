A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 366 The Levator Anguli Scapulae. Fig. 76. Origin.—From the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three or four upper cervical vertebrae. Insertion.—Into the upper fourth of the vertebral border of the scapula. Nerve Supply.—The third and fourth cervical nerves. Action.—To raise the inner portion of the scapula, at the same time depressing the shoulder. The Bhomboideus Major and Minor. Fig. 76. These muscles will be described together, as they are really one. Origin.—From the lower portion of the ligamentum nuchae, the spinous processes of the last cervical and the four or five upper dorsal vertebrae, and the supraspinous ligament. Insertion.—Into the lov/er three-fourths of the vertebral border of the scapula. Nerve Supply.—Branches from the fifth cervical nerve. Actio7t.—To draw the scapula to the spine and at the same time elevate the inner border; this also depresses the outer portion of the bone (and the shoulder). The Supraspinatus. Fig. 76. Origin.—From the inner two-thirds of the supraspinous fossa and the inner surface of the supraspinous fascia. Insej'tion.—Into the upper facet upon the greater tuber- osity of the humerus. Its under fibres are also continued into the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. Nerve Supply.—From the fifth cervical nerve through the suprascapular. Action.—To abduct the humerus, but more especially to hold the head of the humerus against the glenoid cavity of the scapula.

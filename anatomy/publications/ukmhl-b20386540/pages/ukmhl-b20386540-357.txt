355 THE THORAX. The opening of the coronary sinus is found between that of the inferior vena cava and the auriculoventricular. It is guarded by the valve of Thcbesiiis, formed by a reduplica- tion of the endocardium. The inferior caval opening is protected by the Eustachian valve. The tubercle of Lower is found between the two caval openings and at their right. The appendix and anterior surface of the auricle is thrown into ridges by the musculi pectinati. The septum between the two auricles is depressed, form- ing the fossa ovalis (in the foetus it is an opening), sur- rounded by a border, the annulus ovalis. The Left Auricle.—Openijtgs. Four pulmonary veins (two may open by one orifice), auriculoventricular, fora- mina Thebesii. The musculi pectiitati are found in the appendix. The Rig'ht Ventricle.—Opeiiings. The auriculoventri- cular from the auricle, the pulmonary artery. The former is guarded by the tricuspid valves, the latter by the semi- lunar. The tricuspid valve is formed of three main and three secondary triangular flaps of membrane. These flaps or cusps are attached by their bases to the fibrous ring about the auriculoventricular orifice, and also to each other for a short distance from their bases. The semilunar valves, three in number, situated at the beginning of the pulmonary artery (and aorta, also). They are reduplicated folds of the inner coat of the vessel plus some fibrous tissue. At the centre of the free margin is a small nodule, the corpus Arantii. By the pecuHar arrange- ment of the fibrous tissue in the semilunar valves a lunated space is left on either side of each corpus Arantii, consisting

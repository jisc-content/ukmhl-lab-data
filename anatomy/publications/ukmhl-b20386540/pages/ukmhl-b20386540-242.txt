A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 240 placed nearly transversely across the crus at about its mid- dle ; this is the locus nig-er and divides the crus into the crusta (anterior) and teg-mentum (posterior). The crusta and tegmentum are also separated from each other on their outer surface by two grooves which run parallel with each other. One groove is on the inner surface of the crus and is called the oculomotor groove, because out of this groove the third or oculomotor nerve emerges ; the other groove is placed externally and called the lateral groove of the crus. The crusta is composed of fibres which pass through the pons and appear as the anterior pyramids of the medulla, and of connecting fibres to the opposite cerebellar hemi- sphere. These fibres, continued upward, pass under the optic thalamus and take part in forming the internal capsule. The tegmentum is composed of fibres passing from the internal capsule to the medulla and cerebellum. The red nucleus (Figs. 34, 40, 46, 51) is a round nucleus of brownish-gray matter, with a diameter of about three-eighths of an inch ; it is situated in the tegmentum behind the middle of the locus niger and under the posterior part of the optic thalamus. External to the red nucleus, on the same plane with it, but extending backward so as to appear behind it, is a second gray nucleus, the subthalamic ganglion, or the body of Luys. The plane of junction of the opposite tegmenta is called the median raphe. The Aqueduct of Sylvius. Figs. 34, 39, 47. This is the small canal which connects the third with the fourth ventricle. It passes beneath the posterior commis- sure and the lamina quadrigemina, and lies in the raphe between the tegmental tracts.

A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 292 Nerve Supply.—Through the ulnar nerve by filaments from the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves. Action.—It is a flexor and adductor of the wrist and a weak flexor of the forearm. Supinator long-US. {Brachioradialis.) Fig. 67. Be sure to carry the dissection of this muscle to its origin ; save the nerves and arteries found. Origin.—From the upper two-thirds of the external con- dyloid ridge, from the external intermuscular septum of the deep fascia of the arm. Insertion.—Into the base of the styloid process of the radius. Nerve Supply.—The musculospiral from the sixth cer- vical nerve. Action.—Primarily it is a flexor of the forearm, second- arily a pronator in complete supination of the forearm, and has a slight action of supination only when the arm is fully pronated. The Anterior Elbow Space. Fig. 66. The hollow in front of the elbow is bounded on the out- side by the supinator longus, on the inside by the pronator radii teres. Its floor is formed by the brachialis anticus. From without inward is found the musculospiral nerve (dividing into its radial and posterior interosseous branches), radial recurrent artery, musculocutaneous nerve (under the outer margin of the biceps), the tendon of the biceps muscle, the brachial artery and its terminal branches, the ulnar and radial, and their accompanying veins, the median nerve and its muscular branches, and the anastomosis between the anterior branch of the anastomotica magna and anterior ulnar recurrent.

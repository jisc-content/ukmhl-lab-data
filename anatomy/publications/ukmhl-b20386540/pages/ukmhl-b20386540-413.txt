411 THE PERINEUM, MALE. Nerve Supply.—Perineal. Action.—The anterior portion compresses the dorsal vein of the penis and so produces erection of the organ. The middle portion compresses the bulb and its vessels and so aids the action of the anterior portion. The posterior part compresses the membranous urethra and expels its contents (urine or semen). This last action is continued by the two other portions of the muscle, acting peristaltically from be- hind forward. The Internal Pudic Artery. Figs. 82, 83, 112, 114. This is the smaller branch of the bifurcation of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac artery, the larger being the sciatic. It leaves the pelvic cavity with the sciatic be- tween the coccygeus and pyriformis muscles, through the greater sacrosciatic foramen, curves around the base of the spine of the ischium, having the internal pudic nerve on its internal and the nerve to the obturator internus muscle on its external side ; then re-enters the pelvic cavity (ischio- rectal fossa) through the lesser sacrosciatic foramen ; the artery now runs forward along the outer surface of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a canal (Alcock's) formed by the separation of the obturator fascia. In this part of its course the artery is situated about an inch above the lower margin of the tuberosity of the ischium, and is accompanied by the pudic nerve, which divides soon after entering the ischiorectal fossa into the superficial peri- neal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the penis ; the former nerve is below and the latter above the artery (subject standing). The artery continues forward, perforates the posterior layer of the triangular ligament close to the ramus of the ischium, along which it extends between the two layers of

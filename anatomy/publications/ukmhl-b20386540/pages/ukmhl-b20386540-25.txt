THE HEAD, ANTERIOR. 25 2. Horizontally around the head just above the eyebrows and ears. Be very careful, in removing the skin, not to take vi^ith it the underlying muscles, M^hich are closely united to it by a thin layer of dense fatty tissue. Occipitofrontalis. Fig. 2. Origin.—In two portions, the posterior from the mastoid process of the temporal and the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bones. The anterior portion from the corrugator supercilii, pyramidalis nasi, and orbicularis palpebrarum muscles with which it is continu- ous. Also from the overlying integument. Insertion.—Both bellies are attached to the epicranial aponeurosis—galea capitis—which fills in the space left between the muscular portions. The epicranial aponeuro- sis also reaches over the side of the head, as a thin layer covering the temporal fascia, and gives attachment to the small superior and anterior auricular muscles. Nerve Supply.—The facial or seventh; the posterior auricular branch supplying the occipital portion, and the temporal branches the frontal portion of the muscle. Action.—To raise the eyebrows, and produce transverse wrinkling of the forehead. The Auricular Muscles. These are so insignificant as to scarcely repay the atten- tion of the student, and their description is omitted here. The Supratrochlear and Supra-orbital Nerves. Fig. 3. These are both branches of the frontal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. See page 49. The supratrochlear nerve leaves the orbit above the pulley of the superior oblique muscle and passes to the front of the forehead, supplying the skin over the inner third of the supra-orbital arch. The supra-orbital nerve issues from the notch, or fora-

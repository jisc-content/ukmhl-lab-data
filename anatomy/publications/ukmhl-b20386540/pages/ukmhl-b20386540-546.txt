A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 544 broad ligament is the ovarian artery and round ligament; at its base the ureter, uterine artery, veins, and nerves. The Round Ligament. Figs, i lo, 111. Is a fibromuscular flattened cord about five inches long, extending from the upper angle of the uterus outward and forward behind the peritoneum, to cross the iliac vessels, curve around the deep epigastric artery, and leave the abdo- men by the internal abdominal ring. After passing through the inguinal canal the round hgament issues from the ex- ternal ring and becomes lost in the tissues in front of the pubes. It carries with itself into the inguinal canal a tubu- lar process of peritoneum, called the canal of Nuck ; this sometimes persists into adult life and forms a sac for an inguinal hernia. The cord receives blood from the ovarian, superior vesical, and deep epigastric arteries. The Fallopian Tubes. Figs, no, in. One on each side, about five inches long, extend out- ward from the superior angle of the uterus in the free border of the broad Hgament. Near the uterus they are very small, gradually enlarge as they pass outward, finally terminate in a tasseled, or fimbriated extremity. It is attached by one of these fimbriae to the ovary. The open- ing of the tube into the peritoneum is the only communica- tion that the peritoneal sac has with the exterior of the body. The Ovary. Figs, no, in. The ovary is a small body one and one-half by three- fourths by half an inch, oval in outline, its long axis nearly vertical, situated upon the posterior surface of the broad liga- ment of the uterus, and connected to the uterus by a band one and one-half inches long that is called the ligament

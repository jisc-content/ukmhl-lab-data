A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 426 Incisions.â€”(l) Incise the labia majora close to their inner margin from, the mons veneris to the median line of the perineum ; carry the incision, around the anus to the coccyx behind. (2) Make the transverse incisions as indicated on page 404. Carefully remove the integument, especially about the labial margin and around the anus. The descriptions of the various structures given under the male perineum will apply with a slight modification to the female parts. The Superficial Fascia. See page 404. This consists of the two layers, these layers being pierced by the vaginal opening. The deep layer forms in the female an imperfect dartos of the labia majora as it does the dartos of the scrotum in the male. Sphincter Ani Externus. See page 407. The Ischiorectal Fossa, situation, formation, boundaries, and contents. See page 407. Fig. 86. The Internal Pudic Artery. See page 411. Fig. 86. In the female there are these variations : the superficial perineal artery is larger than in the male and is distributed to the labia majora and minora. The artery of the bulb ends in the bulb of the vestibule, and is smaller than in the male. The artery of the crus is a small branch to the crus cHtoridis. The dorsal artery of the clitoris is much smaller than the corresponding artery in the male. The Internal Pudic Nerve. See page 413. Fig. 86. In the female the superficial perineal nerves supply the labia, the erector clitoridis, the sphincter vaginae, and the compressor vaginae. The dorsal nerve of the clitoris is a small branch which supplies that organ.

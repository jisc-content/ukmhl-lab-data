359 THE THORAX, cardium and heart and mediastinum ; a root, at which point the visceral and parietal pleurae become continuous, and where the bronchial tube, vessels, nerves, and lymphatics pass to (or from) the lungs ; an anterior border, thin, notched on the left side for the heart (for its relation to the anterior of the chest see page 263); a posterior border, thick, rounded, lying alongside of the spinal column ; and a lower border, which resembles the anterior. For its rela- tions to the chest wall, see page 262. The main fissure which divides each lung into two lobes passes from the posterior border, three inches from the apex, downward around the outer surface of the lung to end at the lower portion of the anterior border. Besides this main fissure the right lung has a secondary 07te that passes from the centre of the main fissure to the anterior border, dividing the upper lobe into two portions. The structures constituting* the root of the lung* (Fig. 73), are the bronchus, pulmonary artery and vein, the bronchial vessels, nerves, lymphatic glands, the con- necting tissue, and all surrounded by the pleura. The relations of the pulmonary artery, vein, and bronchus are from before backward, bronchus, artery, and vein. On the right side, from above downward, the relation is the same, but on the left side it is artery, bronchus, and vein. The lungs weigh about forty-two ounces, the right being a little heavier than the left. Relations of the Roots of the Lungs.â€”Figs. 71, 72. Diag. 22. The right : In front, the phrenic nerve, anterior pulmonary plexus, superior vena cava, the right auricle of the heart; above, the azygos major ; below, broad ligament of the lung ; and behind, the pneumogastric nerve and the posterior pulmonary plexus.

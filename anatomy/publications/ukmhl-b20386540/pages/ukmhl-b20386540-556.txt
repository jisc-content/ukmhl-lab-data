554 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. THE LOWER EXTREMITY, Anterior. Landmarks. Fig. 87, 98, 115. The landmarks at the lower part of the abdomen belong also to the lower extremity. They are the symphysis, body, and spine of the pubes, Poupart's ligament, the anterior superior spine and crest of the ilium. Below the crest of the ilium to the outer part of the thigh is the great tro- chanter. Its upper border is on a level with the centre of the hip-joint. Nelaton's line is drawn from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the tuberosity of the ischium, and it crosses normally to the top of the great trochanter. About the knee the prominent condyles of the femur, the tuberosities of the tibia, the head of the fibula, and the patella should all be examined. Especially should the varying positions of the patella in flexion and extension of the leg be appreciated. The ridge of the tibia along the front of the leg produces the shin, and as the bone is cov- ered by skin and subcutaneous fascia alone, injuries here are liable to produce wounds through them to the bone. At the ankle the prominent malleoli are recognized. The internal is in front of the external and does not reach so low down. Measurements for difference in the limbs are usu- ally from the anterior superior spines of the ilium to the internal malleoli. See page 434. At the foot the most prominent bony parts are the head of the astragalus (if the foot is fully extended). Behind the foot is the os calcis, which can be felt on both sides. On the inside is the prominent tubercle of the sca- phoid and head of the first metatarsal bone. The susten- taculum tali of the os calcis lies in front of and one inch below

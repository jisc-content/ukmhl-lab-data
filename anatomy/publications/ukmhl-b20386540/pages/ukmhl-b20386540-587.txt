THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 585 wide that passes from the front of the tibia to the front of the fibula just above the ankle joint. It contains one syno- vial sheath for the tendon of the tibialis anticus. The ten- dons of the other muscles pass under it without any synovial investment. (2) The lower portion. This band lies just below the level of the joint, and is arranged like a horizontal " -<. The single limb being external and attached to the upper anterior surface of the calcis. The single limb is split for the passage of the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and the peroneus tertius, and is lined by synovial membrane common for these tendons. The upper leg" of the -< is attached to the internal malleolus, passing over the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis and mostly under the tendon of the tibialis anticus, a thin investment covering the tendon of the latter muscle. The tendon of the former muscle has a separate synovial sheath under this portion of the ligament. The lower leg" of the -< passes over the tendons of the extensor proprius hallucis and tibialis anticus to the inner side of the foot where it blends with the plantar fascia. The synovial sheath of the tibiahs anticus is prolonged from the upper portion, down under this part of the annular ligament. The External Annular Lig'ament. Fig. 123. This is that portion of the deep fascia of the leg and foot, which extends from the external malleolus to the outer posterior and lower borders of the os calcis. It retains the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis in place behind the external malleolus. The tendons are surrounded by a common synovial sheath.

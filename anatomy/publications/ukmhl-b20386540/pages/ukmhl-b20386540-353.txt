THE THORAX. 351 branches (excepting the first), which pierce the overlying muscles and supply the side of the body from the axilla to the crest of the ilium. Each lateral cutaneous nerve divides into an anterior and posterior branch in passing to its distribution. In addition to this the lateral cutaneous branch of the second nerve passes to supply the posterior upper part of the arm, and is called the intercostohumeral nerve. See page 280. The Diaphragm. Figs. 71, 75. Origin.—From the posterior surface of the ensiform ap- pendix, from the inner surface of the cartilages of the six lower ribs, from the ligamentum arcuatum externum and internum, and by two crura from the anterior surface and intervertebral discs and anterior common ligament of the first to the fourth lumbar vertebrae (on the right side), and from the first to the second or third (on the left side). Insertion.—Into the central tendon, which presents three portions or leaves, two lateral and one central. Nerve Supply.—The phrenics, bringing filaments from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. These nerves pass through the muscle and are distributed to its under surface. Action.—To produce inspiration by lengthening the verti- cal dimension of the thorax. To compress the viscera and aid in all expulsive efforts, as defaecation, micturition, par- turition, and vomiting. In vomiting the diaphragm con- tracts to form a hard surface against which the stomach is compressed by the action of the abdominal muscles. Opening's Through the Diaphragm. Aortic opening lies immediately in front of the spine. It gives passage to the aorta, vena azygos major, and thoracic duct. The oesophageal opening lies in front of the aortic to the

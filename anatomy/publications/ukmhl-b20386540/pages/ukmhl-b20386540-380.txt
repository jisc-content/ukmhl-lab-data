A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 378 The Superficial Veins of the Forearm. There are usually two main trunks, the posterior ulnar and posterior radial veins. These begin at the back of the hand in an irregular plexus and proceed up the back of the forearm, communicating with each other by branches. The posterior ulnar curves forward just below the internal con- dyle of the humerus to unite with the anterior ulnar to form the common ulnar. See page 282. The posterior radial empties into the radial at the outer side of the upper part of the forearm. The Superficial Nerves of the Forearm and Hand— These are—for the forearm the external cutaneous branch of the musculospiral and a posterior branch of the cuta- neous portion of the musculocutaneous nerve, for the outer half; and the posterior division of the internal cutaneous, for the inner half of the forearm. In the hand the radial nerve supplies the outer half of the dorsum and the outer two and one-half fingers, while the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve completes the inner half of the back of the hand and two and one- half fingers. DISSECTION. Remove the deep fascia from the back of the forearm, hand, and fingers. At the wrist leave a band of the deep fascia about an inch wide, the posterior annular ligament of the wrist. Clean all the muscles, vessels, and nerves presenting. The Posterior Annular Lig'ament. Fig. 78. This will be found to consist of the fibres of the deep fascia which have been reinforced by additional transverse fibres. This thickened band is about an inch wide, and is attached from the outer border of the radius around the back of the wrist to the inner border of the pisiform and

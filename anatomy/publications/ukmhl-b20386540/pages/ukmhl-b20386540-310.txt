308 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY, of the last two sets of phalanges through their connections with the common extensor aponeurosis. DISSECTION. Divide the abductor pollicis and reflect its portions; cut through the annu- lar ligament, note the relations of the tendons of the long flexor muscles and the median nerve, also the extension up under the ligament of the synovial sac of these tendons. Divide the ulnar artery and nerve just below their deep palmar branches; sever the connections of the superficial arch at the base of the thumb and turn the digital nerves and arteries and the tendons of the sublimis and profundus digitorum, with the lumbricales, below the web of the fingers. Clean the rest of the thumb and little-finger muscles, the deep palmar arch and its branches. The Inner Head of the Flexor Brevis Pollicis. {Adduc- tor Obliqtms.) Fig. 67. Origin.—From the sheath of radial flexor of carpus, os magnum, and bases of second and third metacarpal bones. Insertion.—Into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb with the adductor pollicis ; and by a separate fasciculus into the outer side of the base of the same bone with the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis. Nerve Supply.—By the deep branch of the ulnar from the eighth cervical nerve. Action.—To adduct and flex the carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal articulations acting with the adductor pollicis muscle. Adductor Pollicis. {Adductor Trajtsversus.^ Fig. 67. Origin.—From the lower two-thirds of the front of the third metacarpal bone. Insertion.—Into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, with the inner head of the flexor brevis muscle, and into the inner portion of the aponeurosis of the extensor longus poUicis.

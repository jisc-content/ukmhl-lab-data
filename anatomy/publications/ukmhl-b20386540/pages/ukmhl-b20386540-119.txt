THE NECK, ANTERIOR. 119 It furnishes filaments to the submaxillary ganglion and hypoglossal nerve (at its terminus). The lingual supplies the mucous membrane of the side of the tongue and the floor of the mouth, and the sub- lingual gland. The Otic Ganglion. This small ganglion (one-sixth of an inch in longest dimension) lies internal to the inferior dental nerve, in front of the middle meningeal artery, and close under the foramen ovale. Its roots are sensory (and motor), from inferior maxillary (through the internal pterygoid) nerve ; motor, from the small (lesser) petrosal nerve (which brings fibres from the seventh and ninth nerves); and sympathetic, from the plexus on the middle meningeal artery. Its branches of distribu- tion are supplied to the tensor palati and tensor tympani muscles, to the parotid gland (by way of the auriculotem- poral nerve with which these filaments pass), and to the chorda tympani. The Submaxillary Ganglion. Fig. i8. The submaxillary ganglion lies between the hngual nerve, Wharton's duct, and the anterior portion of the sub- maxillary gland. It is about the size of the head of a common pin. It receives its motor root from the chorda tympani, the sensory root from the lingual, the sympa- thetic from the plexus upon the facial artery. Its fila- ments are distributed to the submaxillary gland, Wharton's duct, and filaments to the lingual nerve which pass on to the sublingual gland and the tongue. The Sublingual Gland. This is the smallest of the salivary glands. It lies immediately under the mucous membrane of the mouth,

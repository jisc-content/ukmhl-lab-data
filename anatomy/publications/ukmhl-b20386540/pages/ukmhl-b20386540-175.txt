175 THE BRAIN. The first bend is the most extensive, the axis of the vesicles being bent to a right angle. These bends have been and will be disregarded in the descriptions, as they would serve to confuse the reader. The changes in the interbrain : The development of the optic thalami has been given above. The floor of the vesicle drops downward to form a blind tubeâ€”the infundi- bulum ; the end of the infundibulum becomes enlarged, and meets an upward pouch from the pharynx of the foetus. This pharyngeal pouch becomes narrowed at its neck and finally cut off from the pharyngeal cavity and remains at- tached to the infundibulum. The rounded mass thus formed from the brain vesicle and the primitive pharynx is the hypophysis or the pituitary body. The cerebral portion constitutes a small central mass ensconced within the horseshoe shaped mass from the pharynx. Fig. 20. The elevation (depression, really) at the junction of the infundibulum and floor of the vesicle is the tuber cinereum. On each side of the median line two elevations appear, which are the corpora albicantia. Forward from the tuber cinereum the lamina terminalis is continuous under the name of the lamina cinerea. The midbrain : The floor becomes thickened by the downward extension of fibres from the greatly enlarged forebrain (cerebrum), and these masses of fibres are called the crura cerebri. The roof of the midbrain becomes bunched to form the corpora quadrigemina. Its central canal is the aqueduct of Sylvius. The hindbrain : It expands upward, outward, and back- ward until the result is the cerebellum, while its thicken- ing in front and below by numerous transverse fibres forms the pons. The afterbrain : In like manner forms the medulla, by

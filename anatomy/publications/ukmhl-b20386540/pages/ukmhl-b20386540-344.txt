A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 342 The Pneumog'astric Nerves. Figs. i8, 71, 72. Are found in the neck between the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery, and behind both. See page 103. The right nerve comes forward between the vein and artery, crosses over the front of the subclavian artery and behind the right innominate vein (gives off the recurrent laryngeal nerve opposite the lower part of the artery), and descends backward and inward to the side of the oesophagus and behind the root of the lung, where it forms the posterior pulmonary plexus. From the plexus it is continued by two branches along the posterior surface of the oesophagus (forming the oesophageal plexus) ; finally these two cords unite, pass through the diaphragm, and are distributed to the posterior wall of the stomach. The left pneumogastric at the base of the neck is be- tween the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, descends behind the left innominate vein, over the front of the transverse aorta (at the lower border of which the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is given off), to the posterior part of the root of the left lung, where it forms a posterior pul- monary plexus. It then continues along the front of the oesophagus by two branches (forming an oesophageal plexus and communicating with the posterior plexus by branches), then these two branches unite and pass through the dia- phragm to the anterior wall of the stomach. The Right Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve. See Neck, page 104. The Left Recurrent Laryngeal. Can be traced curving around the transverse aorta, ex- ternal to the ductus arteriosus and above the pulmonary artery, to pass upward and inward behind the left common

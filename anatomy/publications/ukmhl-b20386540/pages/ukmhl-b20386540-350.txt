A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 348 position. Now this action substitutes a rib of greater for one of less dimensions^ and the result is to increase the dimen- sions of the chest transversely^ and anteroposteriorly by an amount equal to the difference between the areas of the sections of the thorax at the level of these two ribs. The Intercostal Veins. Fig. 74. These veins accompany the intercostal arteries and re- turn the blood from the area which they supply. They terminate by emptying into the veins described below. The Azygos Veins. Figs. 74, 73. These present numerous variations in formation, course, and termination, but the following arrangement is the one usually found. (1) The azygos 7najor begins in the abdomen as a con- tinuation of the ascending lumbar vein, or by a branch from the right renal, or vena cava inferior. It enters the chest through the aortic opening, lies to the right of the aorta upon the intercostal arteries and vertebrse, and at the level of the third or fourth dorsal vertebra arches over the right bronchus and empties into the superior vena cava (now removed) close to its pericardial attachment. It re- ceives the nine or ten lower right intercostal veins, the azygos minor (opposite the sixth or seventh dorsal verte- bra), the right superior intercostal vein, the left azygos superior (at times), the right mediastinal, bronchial, spinal, and oesophageal veins. (2) The azygos minor also begins in the abdomen from the left renal or ascending lumbar veins, enters the chest through the left crus of the diaphragm, ascends at the left of the vertebrae to the level of the seventh or eighth, then turns to the right under the aorta to empty into the major azygos at the level of the sixth or seventh vertebra. The minor

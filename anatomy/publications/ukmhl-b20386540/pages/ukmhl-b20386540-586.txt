584 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. DISSECTION. Incisions.â€”(i) Continue the incision down the front of the leg and foot to toes. (2) Make liberating transverse cuts at the ankle and one across the base of the toes. (3) Carry incisions along the top of the toes. Remove the integument from the leg, foot, and toes. Leave the superficial veins and nerves lying upon the deep fascia. In removing the skin from the toes look out for and save the digital nerves. The Superficial Fascia. The superficial fascia of the leg and foot is continuous with that of the thigh. It varies in thickness but is always thin over the antero-internal surface of the tibia, the mal- leoli, and the dorsum of the foot. The Deep Fascia. Fig. 122. The deep fascia continues the fascia lata from the thigh, being directly continuous with it in the popliteal space and indirectly about the front of the knee where the deep plane of fascia is attached to the tuberosities of the tibia and the head of the fibula. In front, the fascia is continuous with the periosteum along the margins of the antero-internal surface of the tibia. At the outer side of the leg, the fascia is fastened to the fibula by two intermuscular septa which enclose the peroneus longus and brevis. At the ankle, the deep fascia is firmly attached to the bony points about the joint and passes into the deep fascia covering the dorsum and sole of the foot. In the popliteal space and about the ankle, the fascia is reinforced by transverse fibres to which, in the latter instance, the names of annular ligaments are given. The Anterior Annular Ligament.

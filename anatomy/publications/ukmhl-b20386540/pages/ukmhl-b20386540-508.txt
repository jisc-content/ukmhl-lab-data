The Spleen. Fig. 105. The spleen is an oval gland, six by four by one and one- half inches, which Hes behind the fundus of the stomach. Its long axis is parallel with the tenth rib, its upper border with the upper edge of the ninth rib, and its lower border with the lower edge of the eleventh rib. Its inner end is two inches from the left of the middle line behind, and its outer end at the mid-axillary line. It is covered by peritoneum except at the hilum where the vessels and nerves are situated. The spleen is developed in the mesogaster. See page 467. The portion of the primary mesogaster between the stomach and spleen is now called the gastrosplenic omen- tum, and the portion of the mesogaster extending between the spleen and diaphragm is now called the phrenosplenic ligament. Above, the latter process is continuous with the gastrophrenic ligament, and below, the former passes into the left portion of the greater omentum. The splenic artery, vein, lymphatics, and nerves enter or leave the spleen at the hilum of the spleen. Relations.â€”In front, stomach and splenic flexure of the colon. To the outside, the diaphragm, inclusive of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. To the inside, the stomach, pancreas, left kidney. Below the spleen rests upon the costocolic ligament, and has the splenic flexure of the colon below and in front. The blood supply for the spleen comes from the splenic branch of the cceHac axis ; the splenic vein passes to unite

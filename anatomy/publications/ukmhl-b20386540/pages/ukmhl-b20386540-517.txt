Runs in company with the artery from the spleen to its junction with the superior mesenteric to form the portal vein. Its tributaries are the vasa brevia veins, left gastro- epiploic, pancreatic, and inferior mesenteric. DISSECTION. Draw down the liver, carefully sever its ligaments until the vena cava is reached, secure room enough between the diaphragm and the liver to pass a ligature around the vein, tie it, and divide the vein below the ligature. Find the vena cava below the liver and ligate it there, cutting above the ligature. The liver, duodenum, and pancreas can now be removed entirely, dividing the vessels that are found passing to them and the peritoneal pro- cesses which bind them to the posterior abdominal wall, remembering to keep close to the viscera that are being removed. Clean the under surface of the diaphragm, the abdominal aorta and its remaining branches, the inferior vena cava and the veins emptying into it, the suprarenal bodies, kidneys and their blood supply, the ureters, the sper- matic or ovarian arteries. For the present leave the pelvic viscera. The Abdominal Aorta. Figs. 74, 106, 107. Extends from the aortic opening in the diaphragm, over the lower margin of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, to the lower border of the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the two common iliac arteries. The point at which the aorta bifurcates is a little below and to the left of the um- bilicus. The aorta lies at first in front of the vertebra, but below is a little to the left.

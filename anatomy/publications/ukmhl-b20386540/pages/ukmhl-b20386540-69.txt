69 THE HEAD, ANTERIOR. In the median line recognize from above downward the (i) hyoid bone. (2) The thyroid cartilage and its forward projection, called Adam's apple, and the angle left between the alae of the cartilage. (3) The cricoid cartilage, just below (and connected to the thyroid cartilage by a stout membrane ; see page 146) ; the cricoid cartilage is in front of the fifth intervertebral disc. (4) The trachea, (5) ob- scured by the thyroid gland, which lies upon either side of, and is connected by its isthmus across the front of the trachea. (6) Lastly, the depression just above the ster- num—fonticulus gutturis,—and between the anterior ends of the clavicles—the suprasternal, or interclavicular notch. Laterally, from above downward, identify superior curved line of the occipital bone and the mastoid process, its base and tip ; the sternomastoid muscle, which forms a broad elevation, extending from the mastoid process to the sternum and inner end of the clavicle (when it is put upon the stretch). As the arteries (subclavian, outer portion, and the carotids) are injected, their position can be recognized by touch, and their course sketched upon the skin by an aniline pencil. The superficial jugular veins usually show through the integument, and their course can be similarly indicated. The position of the sternoclavicular articulation should be carefully noted, as it marks so many important structures. Consult page 262 for the distance to which the lung extends into the base of the neck. DISSECTION. Incisions.—I. Carry the median incision to the top of the sternum. 2. Make a transverse incision outward along the clavicle to the point of the shoulder. (If the upper extremity is being dissected this incision has already been made. See page 264.)

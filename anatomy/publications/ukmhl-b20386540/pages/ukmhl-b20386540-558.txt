On the outer side of the foot the os calcis, cuboid, and base of the fifth metatarsal bones can be felt. DISSECTION. Incision.â€”(i) From the middle of Poupart's ligament down the front of the thigh to below the patella. (2) Two short transverse cuts at the lower end of (i). Remove the skin only, turning it off laterally as far as possible. The Superficial Fascia. Fig. 115. This fascia varies in thickness with the amount of adipose tissue present. It is described as consisting of two layers, the superficial and deep, but this distinction can be readily made only in the upper third of the thigh. Within the superficial fascia are contained the superficial vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. The superficial layer of the fascia passes up over Pou- part's ligament to become continuous with a similar layer of the abdomen, behind with the fascia of the buttocks, and below passes into that covering the leg. The deep layer is only demonstrated with ease in the upper third of the thigh. It consists of a thickening of the under surface of the superficial fascia and is attached above to the crest of the ilium, Poupart's ligament, spine, crest, and front of the pubes ; internally and externally it blends with the fascia lata, centrally it covers over the saphenous opening and is strongly attached to its outer and lower margins and loosely to its inner margin, forming the cribriform fascia. DISSECTION. Trace the superficial arteries, veins, and nerves. Locate the femoral lym- phatics.

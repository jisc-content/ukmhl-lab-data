A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 548 The Posterior Division of the Internal Iliac Artery. {a) The iliolumbar artery. This passes outward and upward beneath the common iliac vessels and psoas magnus muscle, where it divides into two main trunks, the upper and lower, which supply the adjoining parts and anastomose with the last lumbar, gluteal, and deep circumflex iliac arteries, {b) The two lateral sacral pass inward across the sacrum to anastomose with the sacra media, to supply the surrounding parts, and, penetrating the sacral foramina, to be distributed to the posterior sacral region, (c) The gluteal. This is the direct continuation of the posterior trunk. It leaves the pelvic cavity with the superior gluteal nerve through the great sacrosciatic foramen above the pyriformis muscle. For its distribution, see page 612. The Internal Iliac Vein Is formed at the great sacrosciatic foramen by the junc- tion of the gluteal, sciatic, and internal pudic veins. The venous trunk then ascends and joins the external iliac vein at the sacro-iliac articulation to form the common iliac vein. Besides the above veins the internal iliac receives the lateral sacral, iliolumbar, obturator, prostatic, vesical, hemor- rhoidal (vaginal and uterine in the female) veins. DISSECTION. Close to the bladder divide the remaining ligaments, vessels, nerves, ure- ters, and vasa deferentia passing to it. Remove the bladder and open it from its apex along its anterior wall to the urethra, and this also for its entire length along the upper surface. The Opening's of the Ureters. These openings are three-fourths of an inch behind the internal urinary meatus and the same distance apart. The beginning- of the urethra is called the internal meatus. This opening lies in the median line, three-fourths

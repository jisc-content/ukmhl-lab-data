(The deep origin of the facial nerve is from a nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle opposite the lower part of the pons ; its cortical area is in the lower part of the pre- central convolution of the frontal lobe.) 8. The Auditory Nerve. Figs. 29, 53, 10. This arises just external to the facial at the posterior margin of the pons. Its course is outward to the internal auditory meatus along with that nerve. Besides these two nerves the auditory vessels traverse this foramen. The distribution of the auditory nerve is in two portions : one to the cochlea, utricle, and saccule ; the other to the semicircular canals. (The deep origin of the nerve is from three nuclei in the floor of the fourth ventricle, and the cortical location for hearing is in the first or superior tem- poral convolution.) 9. The Glossopharyng'eal Nerve. Figs. 53, 10, 11. The ninth, tenth, and accessory portion of the eleventh nerves arise from the side of the medulla, in the groove be- tween the restiform tract behind and the olivary body and the lateral tract of the medulla in front. The deep origin of these nerves is from a continuous nucleus in the floor of the posterior part of the fourth ven- tricle and adjacent part of the cord. The ninth, tenth, and the eleventh nerves leave the skull through the central compartment of the jugular foramen. See page 98. There are two ganglia developed upon the glossopha- ryngeal nerve in its course through the jugular foramenâ€” the jugular and the petrous.

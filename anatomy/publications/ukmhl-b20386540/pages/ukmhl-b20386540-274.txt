A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY, 272 and become continuous with the axillary fascia. The attachment of the lesser pectoral (clavipectoral) fascia to the axillary fascia draws upward the latter, and this ex- plains why it is that the floor of the axilla is so hollowed out or concave externally (the pit of the arm). This con- cavity is greatest when the arm is midway between the side of the chest and right-angle abduction. The branches of the acromiothoracic artery will be found in the interval between the pectoralis major, deltoid, and clavicle. They are the humeral, acromial, clavicular, and thoracic. Figs. 60, 61, 62. The humeral (descending) is found along with the ceph- alic vein in the groove between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, supplying both. The acromial may be a branch directly from the main trunk or often from the humeral. It supplies the region about the shoulder. The clavicular branch is a constant branch to the sub- clavius, but may arise from the thoracic branch. The thoracic distribution is usually, by two or more branches, to the pectoral muscles and side of the chest. The External Anterior Thoracic Nerve.—This will be found coming through the costocoracoid membrane and passing to the pectoralis major. Fig. 62. DISSECTION. Remove the costocoracoid membrane and expose the subclavius muscle, first portion of the axillary artery and its two branches, the accompanying vein, and cords of the brachial plexus. Clean the pectoralis minor muscle and the floor of the axilla external to the muscle, saving the nerves and arteries found. Subclavius. Fig, 62. Origin.—From the cartilage and first rib at their point of junction.

The artery is covered by the skin, superficial and deep fascia, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and the deep intermuscular fascia of the leg. The muscular covering is wanting in the lower third of its course. The artery crosses the posterior surface of the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, tibia, and the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint. At the ankle the artery is covered by the annular ligament and origin of the abduc- tor hallucis muscle. The artery has an accompanying vein upon either side which frequently communicate by cross branches. The posterior tibial nerve is at its beginning at the inner side of the artery, but crosses it where the peroneal artery arises, and continues at the outer side of the artery for the rest of its course. Behind the internal malleolus the posterior tibial artery is the central structure of five others. From before backward the order is, tendon of the tibialis posticus, tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, artery, posterior tibial nerve, and (at a little distance, and on a deeper plane) the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis. Besides these the venae comites lie, one in front the other behind the artery and next to it. Branches.â€”(i) Muscular, numerous to the surrounding muscles. (2) The nutrient artery of the tibia, largest in the body, arises near the beginning of the posterior tibial, and enters the nutrient foramen at the upper and middle thirds of the outer border of the tibia. (3) Cutaneous (two or three), which reach the inner side of the leg between the superficial and deep sets of muscles. (4) A communicating

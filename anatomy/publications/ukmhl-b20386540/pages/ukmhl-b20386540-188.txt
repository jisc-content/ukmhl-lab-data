The island is traversed by three or four shallow sulci which radiate from the anterior portion of the lobe in a direction upward and backward. One of these fissures, the central sulcus, is deeper than the others, and divides the lobe into a large anterior portion and a smaller posterior part. The island is surrounded by a well-marked depression, the cir- cular sulcus. The Occipital Lobe. Figs. 23, 24, 26. This constitutes that portion of the cerebrum posterior to the parieto-occipital fissure, and the prolongation of the course of this fissure across the external surface of the cerebrum. The sulci and fissures are usually very poorly marked off. The sulci may be determined as follows : The superior occipital sulcus is the posterior extremity of the intra- parietal sulcus, or at least of a sulcus continuing the direc- tion of this fissure backward ; similarly the inferior occipital sulcus is part of, or a backward extension of, the middle temporal sulcus. By these two irregular and indistinct grooves three convolutions are determined, the superior, middle, and inferior, or the first, second, and third occipital convolutions. The superior convolution is continued into the cuneate convolution on the internal surface of the occipital lobe. The Inner or Mesial Surface of the hemisphere taken as a whole. Figs. 27, 38. Upon the internal surface of the hemisphere are found four of the primary fissures of the cerebrum, viz. : The

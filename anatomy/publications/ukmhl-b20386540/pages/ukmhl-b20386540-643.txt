THE LOWER EXTREMITY, POSTERIOR, 641 Insertion.—Into the outer margin and upper surface of the tendon, of the flexor longus digitorum. Nerve Supply.—The external plantar. Action.—To convert the oblique pull of the flexor longus digitorum into a direct one, and thus assist in flex- ing the four outer toes. Acting alone, or when the flexor longus digitorum is blocked by the full extension of the ankle, it will still flex the toes. The Lumbricales. Four in number. Fig. 133. Origin.—Arise from the clefts between the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum (being attached to two adja- cent tendons excepting the most internal, which arises from the inner margin of the internal tendon). Insertion.—Into the aponeurotic expansion of the tendon of the extensor longus digitorum at the inner side of the four outer toes. Nerve Supply.—The two (sometimes only one) inner muscles are supplied by the internal plantar, the two (sometimes three) outer are supplied by the external plantar. Actiofi.—These muscles will flex the first set of pha- langes (as their tendons pass belozv the centre of motion of the metatarsophalangeal articulations), and extend the last two sets of phalanges (because their tendons are inserted into the tendons of the long extensor muscle above the centre of motion of these articulations). Besides this common action, the internal one will abduct the second toe, and the rest adduct the three outer toes with reference to the middle line of the foot (which passes through the centre of the second toe). For the tendons of the flexor longus hallucis and the flexor longus digitorum, see these muscles, page 627. 41

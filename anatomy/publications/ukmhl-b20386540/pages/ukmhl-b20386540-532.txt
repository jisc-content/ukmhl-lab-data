530 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Branches of the lumbar plexus are as follows :—• The first nerve having received the branch from the last dorsal, divides into the iliohypogastric and ilio-inguinal From the first and second is formed the genitocrural. From the second and third, the external cutaneous. From the second, third, and fourth, the anterior crural and obtu- rator. From the third and fourth, the accessory obturator. And from the fourth the branch passes to enter into the lumbosacral cord. All these branches are formed within the substance of the psoas magnus muscle. The Nerves. (1) The iliohypogastric branch. From the first lumbar. Issues from the upper border of the psoas, crosses the quadratus lumborum and iliacus obliquely to enter the transversalis muscle over the middle of the crest of the ilium. It divides into two branches ; the iliac, which pierces the abdominal muscles and supplies the integument over the outer and posterior surface of the crest as far as the great trochanter, being posterior to the iliac branch of the last dorsal nerve. The hypogastric branch, which passes through the in- ternal oblique about one inch in front of the anterior supe- rior iliac spine, extends downward and forward to appear through the external oblique about two inches above the spine of the pubes, supplying the integument in front of the pubes and dorsum of the penis. (2) The ilio-inguinal. From the first lumbar. It is found at the outer border of the psoas just below the iliohypogastric, takes a course parallel with it but a little lower, to follow close to the crest of the ilium and Poupart's ligament, and appear through the external

These sinuses are also found at other points than where these processes are given off, as at the base of the skull. The sinuses will follow later ; see below. DISSECTION. Split open the superior longitudinal sinus from its beginning to its ending, and in doing so notice the cords which cross it. These are the chordae Willisii. Divide the dura, just above the bone, entirely around the head. Raise the dura from the brain and turn it upv^^ard at the sides as far as possible ; this M^ill expose the attachment of the falx cerebri. The falx is to be cut from its attachment, and M^ith the dura turned back- vi^ard. Divide the cerebral veins v^hen encountered, and turn the dura off backward from the brain, exposing its upper surface. As a rule the dura is not removed far enough backward. In the free margin of the falx will be seen a very small opening, looking like a slit. This is the inferior longitudinal sinus. The Falx Cerebri. Figs. 8 and 9. This is a sickle-shaped process of the dura which lies between the two cerebral hemispheres. It is attached all along its base to the dura (with which it is continuous) and at its attachment, by the divergence of its layers is formed the superior longitudinal sinus. See below. Its anterior extremity is fastened to the crista galli, and its posterior extremity to the upper surface of the tentorium cerebelli. At this rear attachment the straight sinus is formed by the separation of its layers, similar to the formation of the su- perior sinus. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus. Diag. i. Fig. 8. As stated above, this sinus is formed at the base of the falx cerebri, where its two layers pass off laterally into the inner layer of the dura.

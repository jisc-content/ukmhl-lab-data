A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 132 Nerve Supply,—The external branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves. Action.—To extend the head and neck, if both act; to flex the head and neck laterally and rotate them to the same side, if one acts. Complexus. Fig. 76. Origin.—The transverse processes of the upper six dorsal and seventh cervical vertebrae, from the articular processes of the lower three or four cervical vertebrae. Insertion.—Into the surface of the occipital bone between the inner halves of the superior and inferior curved lines. The inner third of the complexus is also called the bi- venter cervicis, inasmuch as its muscular portions are separated by a median tendon. Nerve Supply.—The upper three or four cervical nerves, through their posterior divisions. Actioji.—To extend the head when both act. If one acts it flexes the head laterally. DISSECTION. Divide the complexus and the trachelomastoid at their cranial attachments, and the levator anguli scapulae at its spinal attachments. The rhomboids and the serratus posticus superior should have been removed by this time by the one dissecting the upper extremity. Carefully remove the dense fascia which covers the muscles forming the suboccipital triangle and fills in the space between them. In dissecting off the fascia covering the suboccipital triangle and the deep muscles of the neck, save the princeps cervicis and the profunda cervicis arteries, and recognize their anastomosis with each other and with the vertebral artery through the triangle. Look for the suboccipital nerve and vertebral artery within the triangle. The Suboccipital Triangle. Fig. 19. This triangle is formed by the superior oblique externally, the inferior oblique below, and the rectus capitis posticus major internally. -

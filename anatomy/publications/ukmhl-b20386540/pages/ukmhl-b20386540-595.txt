593 THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. Action.â€”Same as in the hand {q.v., page 389), to flex the first set of phalanges, to extend the second and third sets of phalanges, to abduct the toes from the middle line drawn through the second toe. The Anterior Tibial Artery. Figs. 124, 225. This artery is the anterior branch of bifurcation of the popliteal, just at the lower border of the popliteus muscle. See page 623. The course of the anterior tibial artery is forward between the two heads of the tibialis posticus muscle, then between the tibia and fibula, where the artery crosses over the top of the interosseous membrane to gain the front of the leg. It turns downward resting upon the interosseous mem- brane and between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum for the upper third of its course, then between the tibialis anticus and the extensor proprius hallu- cis for the middle third, then finally between the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis and the tibia for the lower third. In front of the ankle joint the name of the artery is changed to the dorsalis pedis. The artery has on either side an accompanying vein which frequently commu- nicate with each other. The anterior tibial nerve Hes at the outer side of the artery for its upper third, over the front of the artery for its middle third, and then again at the outer side of the artery for the lower third. The course of the artery is indicated upon the outer surface of the leg by a line drawn from the inner margin of the head of the fibula to the mid-point in front of the ankle joint between the malleoli. The deeper guide to the artery is the intermuscular space at the outer margin of the tibialis anticus muscle, for the upper two- thirds ; and between the tendons of the extensor proprius 38

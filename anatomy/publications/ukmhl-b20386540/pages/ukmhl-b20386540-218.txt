218 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The anterior pillars and the anterior part of the body of the fornix have the septum lucidum attached to them. The posterior pillar of the fornix is flattened and its outer margin becomes much thinned, especially as the hippocampus major is neared ; this thin, lateral, external margin of the posterior pillar of the fornix is called the fimbria (fringe). As already stated, the fornix is developed from the inner portion of the lamina terminaHs. Page 173. The under surface of the corpus callosum is left exposed (after proper dissection) between the diverging posterior pillars of the fornix, and being striated is called the lyre. The Foramina of Monro. Figs. 31, 32, 33, 38, 39, 43. Are two openings, one from each lateral ventricle, into the cavity of the third ventricle. They establish a free communication between the lateral and the third ventricles and between the lateral ventricles themselves (by way of the third). The opening is semilunar in shape, with the concavity pointing downward and backward, and it is a gap left between the bend or genu of the fornix and the anterior extremity of the optic thalamus. Through the opening of Monro pass the choroid plex- uses into the third ventricle. DISSECTION. Divide the body of the fornix and reflect the two portions. Save the velum interpositum and its choroid plexuses. The Velum Interpositum and the Choroid Plexuses of the Cerebral Ventricles. Figs. 32, 33, 35, 36, 39. After the fornix has been removed the vascular mem- brane, which is called the velum interpositum, is exposed. It is seen to have a triangular shape and to be continuous

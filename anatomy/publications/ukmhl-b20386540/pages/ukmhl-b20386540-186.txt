186 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. The Parietal Lobe. Figs. 23, 24, 26. Anteriorly the parietal lobe is limited by the fissure of Rolando, posteriorly by the external portion of the parieto- occipital fissure and a line extending in the direction of that fissure, below by the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius and a line continuing its horizontal direction to the posterior boundary. Internally, the parietal lobe merges into the quadrate lobe. For its boundaries see page 191. The parietal lobe is furrowed by a single (named) fissure or sulcus, the intraparietal. The intraparietal sulcus is usually found in the shape of a horizontal T-shaped groove, the cross-bar of the T being parallel with the fissure of Rolando, and the upright arm with the great longitudinal fissure. This arm is usually prolonged into the occipital lobe, where it serves to mark off the superior from the middle occipital convolutions. Between the fissure of Rolando and the transverse arm of the T is the ascending* parietal convolution. This convolution is usually continuous around the lower end of the Rolandic fissure with the ascending frontal convo- lution. The lower ends of these two convolutions together with the adjacent portion of the inferior frontal convolution are called the operculum—or roof—because they cover in the central lobe or island of Reil. The ascending frontal and parietal convolutions are also often united around the upper end of the fissure of Rolando by the paracentral convolution. Above the upright arm of the T lies the superior parietal convolution, which is merged into the quadrate lobe on the inner surface of the hemisphere, and below this arm is the inferior parietal convolution, which is further subdivided into two convolutions—the anterior one, the supramargi- nal, which arches over the upturned extremity of the hori-

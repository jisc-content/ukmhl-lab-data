A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 644 The fifth and sixth digital arteries are both branches of the communicating artery from the dorsum of the foot. The sixth suppHes the inner side of the great toe and anasto- moses backward with the internal plantar artery; the fifth takes a forward course like the other digital arteries, di- vides into two collateral digital branches at the web of the toes and supplies the opposing sides of the great and second toes. There are then six digital, and ten collateral digital ar- teries, numbered from without inward. DISSECTION. Divide the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum just in front of the acces- sorius and reflect it, with the lumbricales, forward. Clean all the remaining muscles and tendons. The Third Layer. Flexor Brevis Hallucis (Pollicis). Fig. 134. Origin,—From the inner border of the cuboid bone, from the under surface of the tendon of the tibialis posticus, over the cuneiform bones. Insertion.—By a divided tendon, one part with the ab- ductor hallucis into the inner border of the base of the first phalanx, the other with the tendon of the adductor hallu- cis into the outer border of the same bone. A sesamoid bone is found in each head. Nerve Supply.—The internal plantar. Action.—To flex the first phalanx of the great toe. The Adductor Hallucis. Fig. 134. Origin.—From the plantar surface of the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones, and from the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus. Insertion.—Along with the outer head of the flexor

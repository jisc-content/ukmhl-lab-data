THE HEAD, ANTERIOR, 29 Nerve Supply.—The temporofacial division of the sev- enth nerve. Action.—To close the eyehds. The Tarsal Ligaments. The internal is a fibrous band less than a quarter of an inch long which is attached internally to the crest of the nasal portion of the superior maxilla and externally gives attachment to the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle, and di- vides into two portions, which are projected into the mar- gins of the tarsal cartilages. The external tarsal ligament passes from the outer extremities of the tarsal cartilages to the orbital process of the malar bone. Pyramidalis Nasi. That portion of the occipitofrontalis which is extended to the nasal bones where they are joined by their cartilages. The compressor narium, depressor alae nasi, dilator naris anterior, and dilator naris posterior are muscles of interest to the specialist in the field of anatomy and need not be dissected by the student (there are too many other struc- tures of more importance than insignificant muscles of this sort, that demand his attention). DISSECTION. Divide the aponeurosis of the occipitofrontalis in the median Hne and also over the vertex of the head from ear to ear. Reflect the anterior triangular portion forward and downward; when near the orbit the corrugator supercilii will be exposed. By turning the muscle still further downward the supra-orbital notch or foramen and its contents will be exposed. Reflect the posterior half of the occipitofrontalis. The temporal fascia is now exposed. After learning its attachments cut it away from its upper attach- ment, beginning at the external angular process of the frontal bone, and turn it downward. This discloses the temporal muscle.

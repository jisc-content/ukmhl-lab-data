A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 190 parieto-occipital, calcarine, hippocampal or dentate, and the collateral. The parieto-occipital fissure deeply grooves the inner surface of the cerebrum in a direction downward and forward, starting at the junction of the posterior one-fifth with the anterior two-fifths of the margin (inner) of the hemisphere, and terminating opposite a point directly below the splenium of the corpus callosum. The calcarine fissure begins in the posterior part of the occipital lobe and passes directly forward to merge into the parieto-occipital fissure at its middle point. The corresponding elevation within the lateral ventricle produced by the calcarine fissure is called the calcar, or hippocampus minor. The Hippocampal or Dentate Fissure. Figs. 27, 28. This is a groove which begins just below the hinder end of the corpus callosum and runs forward in the internal margin of the temporal lobe. The elevation which it pro- duces in the middle horn of the lateral ventricle is the hippocampus major. By separating the lips of the fissure the floor is seen to have a transversely striated appearance, hence the name of dentate fissure. The Collateral Fissure. Fig. 28. This fissure extends anteroposteriorly from the temporal into the occipital lobes. The raised portion of brain matter produced by this fissure in the floor of the (posterior and descending horns of the) lateral ventricle is called the eminentia collateralis. The Callosomarginal Fissure. Figs. 27, 38. This is a well-marked sulcus which begins beneath the anterior extremity of the corpus callosum, turns backward, conforming to the curve of this structure until over its

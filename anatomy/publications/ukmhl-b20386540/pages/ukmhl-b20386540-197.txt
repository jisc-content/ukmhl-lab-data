197 THE BRAIN. white fibres extend backward and outward to the beginning of the fissure of Sylvius. These bands are called the crura, or peduncles of the corpus callosum. The anterior perforated spaces are limited internally by these peduncles. The beg'inning- of the fissure of Sylvius is at the outer margin of the anterior perforated space, and separates the temporal from the frontal and central lobes of the cerebrum. The junction of the optic nerves is called the optic chiasm or commissure. This junction takes place in the middle line and in front of the terminus of the crura cerebri. Outward and forward from the commissure projects the optic nerves, while backward and outward extend the optic tracts, which curve around the outer side of the crura cerebri and disappear between them and the inner margin of the temporal lobes. Behind the optic chiasm is an elevation (really depres- sion) of the floor of the cerebrum called the tuber cine- reum. The tuber cinereum is prolonged (downward) in the shape of a funnel-shaped stalk, the infundibulum, upon which or attached to which is the pituitary g-land (providing the brain has been carefully removed). The two lobes of the pituitary body can be determinedâ€”a small central posterior one situated within the horse-shoe shaped anterior and larger one. See Develop7nent, page 175. Immediately posterior to the tuber cinereum and close to the middle line are two small but well-marked, rounded nodules, the corpora albicantia (from their white color) or mammillaria (from their resemblance to the mammae). Between the corpora mammillaria and the pons, and within the depression between the crura is the posterior perfo- rated space formed by the arteries of the posterior median ganglionic system.

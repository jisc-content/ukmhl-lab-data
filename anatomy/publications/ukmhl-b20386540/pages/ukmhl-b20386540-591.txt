THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 589 Tibialis Anticus. Figs. 123, 124. Origin.—From the under surface of the external tuber- osity of the tibia, from the upper half or two-thirds of the outer surface of the tibia, from the adjacent portion of the interosseous membrane, from the upper third of the inner surface of the deep fascia covering the muscle, and from the intermuscular septum between the extensor longus digi- torum and itself Insertion,—Into the adjoining portions of the inner and lower surfaces of the internal cuneiform and first metatarsal bones. Nerve Supply.—The anterior tibial branch of the external popliteal nerve. Action.—To flex the foot upon the leg, to raise (invert) the inner border of the foot, to adduct the anterior part of the foot. Extensor Long'us Digitomm. Figs. 123, 124, Origijt.—From the external tuberosity of the tibia, from the front of the head of the fibula, from the upper three- fourths of the anterior surface of the fibula, from the upper third of the interosseous membrane, and for the same extent from the inner surface of the deep fascia covering the leg, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the border- ing muscles. Insertion.—Into the four outer toes by separate tendons which divide into three slips. The middle slip in each case being inserted into the base of the second phalanx, the other two tendons passing around the middle one to be in- serted into the bases of the third phalanx. From the margins of each tendon slips pass to the lateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal articulations. The tendons of the interossei, lumbricales, and extensor

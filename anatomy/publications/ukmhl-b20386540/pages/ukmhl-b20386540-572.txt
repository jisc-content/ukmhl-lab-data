A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, 570 The Femoral Artery. Figs. 117 to 120. This is that portion of the great arterial trunk to the lower extremity which extends from beneath Poupart's ligament to the opening in the adductor magnus muscle. It is a continuation of the external iliac above, and is con- tinued as the popliteal below. The course of the artery is indicated by a line drawn from the mid-point between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis to the adductor tubercle, the thigh being slightly abducted, flexed, and rotated outward. The femoral artery passes through Scarpa's triangle from the middle of its base to its apex, and through Hunter's canal. Its relations will be considered in these localities. Relations of the Femoral Artery.â€”Scarpa's triangle. See above. Here the artery is centrally placed between the femoral vein on the inside and the anterior crural nerve and its branches on the outside. The vein as it descends passes to a deeper level than the artery, so that at the apex of the triangle it comes to occupy a position behind and internal to the artery. The internal cutaneous branch of the anterior crural nerve crosses over the front of the artery in the lower part of the triangle, while the internal saphenous nerve con- tinues along the outer side of the vessel. In this part of its course the artery rests at its upper part upon the tendon of the psoas magnus (which separates it from the pelvis and the capsule of the hip-joint) the nerve to the pectineus and that muscle itself At its lower portion, upon the profunda artery and vein (which inter- vene between the femoral and the pectineus muscle), and the adductor longus. In thin people a small portion of the

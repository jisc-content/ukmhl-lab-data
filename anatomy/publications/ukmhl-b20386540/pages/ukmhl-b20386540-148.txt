148 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, The Nasal Fossae. Figs. 12, 13. DISSECTION. Take the lower segment of the skull and divide it with a saw anteroposte- riorly just at one side of the vomer. Study the nasal fossae. Each nasal fossa is divided by the superior, mid- dle, and inferior turbinated bones into the superior, middle, and inferior meatus. The nasal duct opens into the anterior part of an inferior meatus, the infundi- bulum opening of the frontal sinus and anterior ethmoidal cells is in the anterior part of a middle meatus, and at the middle portion is the opening of the max- illary sinus, or the antrum of Highmore. In the anterior part of the superior meatus is the opening of the posterior eth- moidal cells, and in its posterior portion the opening of the sphenoidal sinus. It will hardly repay the student to undertake the dissec- tion of the small vessels and nerves which are found upon the walls of the nasal fossa. Upon the Septmn.â€”The septum is crossed from above downward and forward by the nasopalatine nerve and artery and the septal branch of the nasal nerve. Each spongy turbinated mass is provided with an artery, which comes from the nasopalatine branches of the internal maxillary artery. DISSECTION. On a dry skull (sawn through anteroposteriorly) locate the sphenopalatine foramen. In the specimen dissect off the mucous membrane over a corres- ponding area and expose the sphenopalatine foramen and the small artery and nerves it transmits. Remove the mucous membrane carefully from the nasal fossa under the cribriform plate of the ethmoid and find the nerves and arteries entering at this point. Through the sphenopalatine foramen the nasopalatine or sphenopalatine artery and nerve enter the nasal fossa. They divide into two branches, an ex- ternal and internal, to the outer wall and the septum (inner wall) of the nose. The sphenopalatine artery is the terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery and enters the sphenopalatine

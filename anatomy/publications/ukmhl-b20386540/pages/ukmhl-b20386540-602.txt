A MANUAL OF ANATOMY. 600 Remove the integument from the lumbar, gluteal, and posterior crural regions. To expose the back of the thigh (and for that matter the leg) it will not be necessary to make median and transverse incisions. But reflect the integu- ment from the outer to the inner side of the limb, and from above downward, at this time as far downward as the calf of the leg. Do not cut this large skin flap away but use it for covering the part. The Superficial Fascia, Posterior Portion. This layer is continuous with the fascia described upon the anterior aspect of the thigh. See page 556. Upon the small of the back and over the buttocks, the superficial fascia is usually very thick and consists of very coarse granular adipose tissue. See page 360. DISSECTION. Remove the superficial fascia from the entire area corresponding to the integument, saving the cutaneous nerves and veins. The Fascia Lata, Posterior Portion. The posterior portion of the fascia is continuous with the anterior at the sides of the thigh, with the deep fascia of the leg in the popliteal space, and is attached above and below and at the sides, as given on page 558. Above, the fascia divides into two laminae between which the gluteus maximus lies, and into the angle of division at the outer side of the thigh it is inserted similar to the tensor vaginae femoris. The external lamina is the stronger, and is attached to the coccyx and the sacrum. The internal layer blends with the outer margin of the great sacrosciatic ligament. The two layers become united at the margins of the gluteus maximus, the external portion then passing over the gluteus medius and being fastened to the crest of the ilium, the internal to the tuberosity of the ischium and the pubic arch. The portion of the fascia lata into which the gluteus

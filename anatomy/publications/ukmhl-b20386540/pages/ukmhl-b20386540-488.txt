A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. 486 The dissector is expected to first read the descriptions and then to expose the organs according to the plan as given later, identifying as he goes the main points regarding each organ. Too much stress cannot be given to the study of the intimate and projected surface relations of the various organs of the abdominal cavity. Every year sees surgeons successfully invading new fields, hitherto forbidden ground ; in the last few years no part of surgery has yielded more brilliant results than in the domain of the abdomen. The student is urged to do more than to casually identify the main abdominal relations ; he is to study for himself the position of each and every organ without reference to what may be written about it. Read what has been said, then study and think for himself He will find there are many surprises in store for him if he studies in this way. The Liver. Figs. 96, 97, 104, 105, 108, 109. Position and Size.—The Hver occupies the dome-shaped space under the diaphragm on the right side, reaching across the middle line a distance of two and one-half inches. It is the largest gland in the body, weighing about three and one-half pounds. It measures twelve inches from side to side, six and one-half from before backward, and three and one-half vertically in its thickest part (in the right lobe). The Ligaments.—The liver is held in position by five Hgaments, all, except the round, derived from the periton- eum which encloses almost the entire gland, and all (with the same exception) attached to the diaphragm. (i) The suspensory, falciform, or broad ligament is the first one seen on opening the abdomen. It is attached to the right of the middle line from the umbilicus backward to the posterior part of the diaphragm, and below to the liver.

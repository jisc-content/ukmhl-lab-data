A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. 370 nerve through the scapular notch into the infraspinous fossa, to terminate in the muscle there. Find the dorsalis scapulae artery and trace its course upon the back of the scapula, cutting as much of the overlying muscle away as is necessary to fol- low it. In the same way dissect out the circumflex nerve and the posterior circum- flex artery to their distribution to the teres minor and deltoid muscles. Divide the rhomboid muscles vertically midway between their attachments and reflect them. At the upper part of the vertebral border of the shoulder find the posterior scapular artery and trace its branches as far as possible. Cut the latissimus dorsi transversely at its middle and reflect its central portion, severing it from its costal attachments. The Serratus Posticus Superior. Fig. 76. Origin.—From the lower portion of the ligamentum nuchae, the spines of the last cervical and first three dorsal vertebrae, and the supraspinous ligaments. Insertion,—Into the posterior surface of the second to the fifth ribs inclusive, just external to their angles. Nerve Supply,—The second and third intercostal nerves. Action.—To raise the ribs and aid in inspiration. The Serratus Posticus Inferior. Fig. 76. Origin.—From the spines of the last two dorsal and first two lumbar vertebrae. Insertion.—Into the lower borders of the last four ribs. Nerve Supply.—The tenth and eleventh intercostals. Action.—To draw the ribs downward, thus affording a fixed point for the action of the diaphragm and so aiding inspiration. The Posterior Scapular Artery. Fig. 76. Usually arises from the third portion of the subclavian, but may come off as the lower branch of the transverse cervical. For its course from the subclavian see page 113. When

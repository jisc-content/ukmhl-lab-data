A few muscular fibres in the median line reaching from the posterior nasal spine to the tip of the uvula. Its func- tion is to elevate the uvula. Levator Palati. This arises from the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone in front of the carotid canal and from the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. It is inserted into the soft palate along the middle line. The action is to raise the soft palate and close the posterior nares. DISSECTION. Remove the levator palati and the upper portion of the palatopharyngeus. This exposes the tensor palati muscle and the ascending palatine artery. Tensor Palati. Arises from the scaphoid fossa of the sphenoid bone, its tendon winds around the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate and expands into a second muscular portion, which is attached along the posterior margin of the hard palate and into the median raphe of the soft palate. For the ascending palatine artery, see Facial, page 95. DISSECTION. Remove the mucous membrane from the anterior pillar of the fauces and expose the palatoglossus muscle which forms this pillar. Palatoglossus. Extends from the anterior surface of the soft palate to the side of the base of the tongue, where it interlaces with the styloglossus muscle. Its action is to draw the sides

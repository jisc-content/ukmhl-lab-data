296 A MANUAL OF ANATOMY, radialis, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis digitorum, for the upper half. In the lower half, and for the entire course, by the skin and fasciae. Internally : The flexor carpi ulnaris. The ulnar nerve is close to the ulnar side of the artery for the lower two- thirds of its course in the forearm. Outside : The tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum for the lower two-thirds. Behind: Brachialis anticus, flexor profundus digitorum. Branches of the Ulnar Artery, (1) Recurrent: (a) The anterior. Usually a branch from the posterior recurrent may arise from the ulnar just after its origin. It ascends behind the pronator radii teres to anastomose upon the brachialis anticus with the anterior branch of the anastomotica magna and the in- ferior profunda. (^) The posterior recurrent. A larger artery than the anterior (which is usually derived from it) from the inner side of the ulnar. It runs upward upon the flexor profundus digitorum to behind the internal condyle, and between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, and terminates by an anastomosis with the inferior profunda, posterior branch of the anastomotica magna, and interosseous recurrent. Behind the internal condyle it is close to the ulnar nerve. (2) Common interosseous : This is a large branch from the outer part of the ulnar, about half an inch long, which passes backward and divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries, (a) The anterior interosseous con- tinues the direction of the main trunk down the front of the interosseous membrane, between the flexor longus poUicis and flexor profundus digitorum, to the upper margin of the pronator quadratus muscle, behind which it disappears.

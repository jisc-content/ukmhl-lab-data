THE BRAIN. 169 This heaping up of cells goes on ; they rise higher and higher and finally coalesce over the gutter, converting it now into a tube. During this time the anterior half of the tube spreads laterally and so becomes larger than the posterior portion. The dilated portion is the forerunner of the brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, pons, and medulla), while the long, slender hinder portion eventually forms the spinal cord. We will confine these remarks to the anterior portion of the primitive cerebrospinal tube. The next change is the production of three distinct swell- ings in the brain end of the tube, these swellings being pro- duced by the dilatation of the central canal (internally) and the heaping up of cells (externally) opposite the dilatations. These dilatations are called vesicles, and are distinguished as anterior, middle, and posterior. These three original vesicles are next increased to five by an outgrowth from the anterior vesicle and a subdivision of the posterior. The anterior extension enlarges forward, outward, up- ward, and backward ; the outgrowth from the posterior vesi- cle takes place upward, laterally, and backward. These five vesicles are now named the forebrain, inter- brain (original anterior vesicle), the midbrain (middle vesi- cle), hindbrain, and the afterbrain (both from the posterior vesicle). From these vesicles all the complex structures of the fully formed brain are developed by a process of thick- ening here and there, thinning in other places, the pushing out of portions here, the invagination there, and the flexions or bending of the axis of the vesicles until the completed brain is the result. The central canal of the primitive vesicles in the adult brain constitutes the various ventricles.

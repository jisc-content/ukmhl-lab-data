18 A MANUAL OF ANA TOMY. The inion ; this is another name for the external occipital protuberance. Laterally.â€”The supra-orbital arch is the prominent margin bounding the orbital cavity above. It terminates internally at the extremity of the nasofrontal groove in the obscure internal angular process, and externally in the prominent external ang'ular process (E. A. P.), which is one of the very useful cranial landmarks. The zygomatic arch lies horizontally and limits the cranial from the facial regions. It also corresponds very nearly with the lower and external border of the temporal lobe of the brain. The external auditory meatus is a conspicuous and useful landmark used in cranial measurements, as it is both easily felt and seen. The parietal eminence is more of an area than a point, but it is useful in taking general measurements. The mastoid process (its tip and posterior border), is a prominent and stable landmark in the adult, but in children cannot be of much use as it is not developed. The superior curved line of the occipital bone forms usually a readily recognizable ridge arching forward from the inion to the base of the mastoid process. It determines the boundary between the back of the head and neck. The Sylvian point" is the point upon the cranium which indicates where the Sylvian fissure reaches the ex- terior of the cerebrum. It is found at a distance of one and one-quarter inches directly behind the external angular process of the frontal bone. Relations of the exterior of the brain to the surface of the cranium. The margins of the cerebral hemispheres.

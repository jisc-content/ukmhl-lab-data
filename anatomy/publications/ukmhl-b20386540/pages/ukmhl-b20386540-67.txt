THE HEAD, ANTERIOR. 67 Masseter. Figs. 2, 3, 4. Origin.—The deep portion, from the inner surface of the zygomatic arch and from the posterior third of the lower border of the same ; the superficial portion, from the lower border of the anterior two-thirds of the zygomatic arch and malar bone. Insertion.—The deep portion, into the upper half of the ramus of the lower jaw and coronoid process ; the super- ficial portion, into the lower half of the ramus extending as far as the angle. Nerve Supply.—The inferior maxillary branch of the fifth cranial nerve through its masseteric branch. Action.—To close the jaw ; and, by the superficial por- tion, to slightly protract it. Buccinator. Figs. 3, 4. Origin.—From the pterygomaxillary ligament (a liga- ment extending from the hamular process of the internal plate of the pterygoid bone to the posterior extremity of the mylohyoid ridge of the inferior maxilla) and from the outer surface of the alveolar process of the superior and inferior maxillary bones opposite the molar teeth. Insertion.—Into the orbicularis oris, some of the lower fibres passing into the upper lip, and some of the upper fibres into the lower lip. Nerve Supply.—The seventh cranial nerve through its buccal branch. The buccal branch of the inferior maxil- lary nerve passes to the muscle also. See page 117. Action.—To retract the angles of the mouth, to flatten the cheeks, and expel the contents of the mouth, also to force the food between the teeth.

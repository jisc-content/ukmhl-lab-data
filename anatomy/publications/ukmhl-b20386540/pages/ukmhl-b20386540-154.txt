154 A MANUAL OF ANA TO MY. The Arachnoid Membrane. Fig. 20. This is a very thin but distinct membrane which lies within the dura and in turn covers the pia. It is connected to the latter by delicate filaments, especially over the con- vexity of the brain, called the subarachnoid tissue, hence it is sometimes described as a part of that membrane (pia). The arachnoid passes smoothly over the surface of the pia and does not follow it into the sulci and fissures, except into the great longitudinal fissure, in order to get from one side to the other beneath the falx cerebri; and into the great transverse fissure, where it has to turn around the tentorium cerebelli. Over the convexity of the brain the arachnoid lies closely applied to the pia so that it can with difficulty be separated from it and demonstrated, but on the lower sur- face (base) of the brain it is much thickened and is sepa- rated from the pia in two well-marked localities. These spaces within the arachnoid, between the arachnoid and the pia, are called the subarachnoidean spaces, anterior and posterior. (i) The anterior subarachnoid space lies at the base of the brain. It reaches forward to the beginning of the great longitudinal fissure, laterally to the inner margins of the temporal lobes of the brain, and posteriorly it covers the pons and medulla, and communicates along the sides of both with the posterior subarachnoid space, and below with the similar cavity surrounding the spinal cord. Within the anterior subarachnoid space are contained the medulla, the pons and its peduncles, the cerebral crura, the structures at the base of the brain which form the floor of the third ventricle (see page 222), the basilar, internal carotid arteries, and their branches, especially that arterial anastomosis which forms the circle of Willis.

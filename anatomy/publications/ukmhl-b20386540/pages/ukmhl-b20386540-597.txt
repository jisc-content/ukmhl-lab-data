THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ANTERIOR. 595 The Dorsalis Pedis Artery. Fig. 125. This is the continuation of the anterior tibial from the front of the ankle, along the front of the foot, to the space between the first and second metatarsal bones, where it ter- minates by dividing into the dorsaHs hallucis and the deep communicating artery. In its course it passes between the tendons of the exten- sor proprius hallucis and the extensor longus digitorum, and is crossed near its termination by the inner tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. The venae comites lie upon either side of the artery, and the anterior tibial nerve at its outer side. The course of the dorsahs pedis is indicated by a Hne drawn from the mid-point between the malleoli to the inter- val between the first and second metatarsal bones. TJie Branches of the Dorsalis Pedis. (1) The internal tarsal. Several small branches to the inner side of the foot. (2) The external tarsal turns outward beneath the exten- sor brevis digitorum muscle to the outer side of the foot, where it enters into an anastomosis with the external malleolar, anterior peroneal, external plantar, and the meta- tarsal arteries. (3) The metatarsal artery passes outward under the ten- dons of the extensor brevis digitorum muscle and across the heads of the four outer metatarsal bones to the outer border of the foot. Above, it anastomoses with the external tarsal, and at the outer side of the foot with the external plantar. From the front part of the artery the three interosseous branches are given off. The interosseous arteries pass forward in the second,

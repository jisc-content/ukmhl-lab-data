Fig. 17. Dissection of Neck.â€”i, Posterior auricular artery. 2, Sterno-mastoid muscle divided and drawn upward and backward. Shows the course of the spinal accessory nerve through it. 3, Spinal accessory nerve. 4, Occipital artery. 5, Hypo- glossal nerve. 6, Lesser occipital nerve. 7, Descendens hypoglossi lying upon the common carotid. In this subject the nerve seems to be a branch (uses the sheath) of the pneumogastric nerve. 8, Communicans hypoglossi. In this connection consult Diagram No. VI. 9, Pneumogastric. 10, Spinal accessory. It is seen to be joined by a branch from the cervical plexus. 11, Phrenic nerve, 12, Subclavian nerve. 13, Brachial plexus. 14, Transverse cervical artery. 15, Transverse facial artery. 16, Mylo-hyoid nerve, and behind it the submental branch of the facial artery. 17, Mylo-hyoid muscle. 18, Hyo- glossus muscle. 19, Lingual artery. Consult Diagram No. VIII. 20, Superior laryngeal nerve. 21, Thyro-hyoid muscle. 22, Superior thyroid artery. 23, Anterior belly of the omo-hyoid. 24, Sterno-hyoid muscle. 25, Sterno-thyroid muscle. 26, Fascia binding the tendon of the omo-hyoid in place. 27, Subclavian artery. 28, Posterior belly of the omo-hyoid. 29, Posterior scapular artery.

UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX, ANTERIOR. 293 DISSECTION. Trace the radial nerve to the posterior margin of the tendon of the supinator longus (brachioradiahs). The radial artery until it disappears under the extensor tendons of the forearm, and its branches in the forearm. The ulnar artery to the wrist, and its branches. The Radial Nerve. Fig. 66. The anterior branch of the musculospiral nerve. It descends behind the inner portion of the supinator longus muscle, until at the lower part of the muscle it passes backward to the posterior surface of the thumb and hand. The Posterior Interosseous Nerve. This is the posterior branch of the musculospiral nerve and disappears from the front of the elbow by passing into the substance of the supinator brevis muscle. The Radial Artery. Figs. 66, 67. This is the outer branch of bifurcation of the brachial, the direction of which it continues. The portion of the artery that lies in the forearm extends from below the elbow to the wrist, where the artery passes posteriorly under the extensor tendons of the thumb. Its course is outward and downward, between the prona- tor radii teres and the supinator longus (brachioradialis) (the latter of which overlaps the artery in front), then between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and the supinator longus. The artery is indicated by a line drawn from just below the centre of the elbow to the inner side of the styloid process of the radius. The radial nerve is at the radial side of the artery for the upper two-thirds of its course, but not in close relation with it, and is not seen in ligation of the artery. The artery rests upon the tendon of the biceps, supinator

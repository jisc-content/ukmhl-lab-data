10 est in corporibus animalium." By unity of organic com-' position it is implied, that the materials which compose corresponding organs in the superior kinds of animated beings are the same, and that the varieties these organs present are only modifications consequent upon their dif- ferent degrees of development. In other words, an organ being given, it will in one animal perform its functions to a certain extent; in a second it will perform the same in a greater or a less degree; while in a third it will execute addi- tional functions. Now in these three instances, though the organ may present great and striking differences in all its external characters, still the materials which compose it are the same, and it is upon the number and the extent of use for which the organ is destined that its develop- ment or degree of perfection alone depends. Thus the teeth, the special use of which is to triturate the food, present a low degree of development in the Crustacea, as the crab, where they are situated in the stomach, and per- form that single function; in another class, as gramnivo- rous animals, they are further developed, and occupying the mouth, execute another officeâ€”that of prehension ; while in a third class, as the carnivorous tribes, they arrive at their maximum of development, and become, in addition, oro-ans of attack. The ribs, which in most animals are intended to protect the lungs, are developed to their max- imum in the turtle, and, by uniting, are converted into a case for the protection of the creature. Again, if we observe the anterior extremity of a vertebrated animal, we shall find in one class it is used as an instrument of flight, in another as an instrument of swimming, in a third as an instrument for moving on the surface; in one ani- mal it is a tool "for excavating, in another for climbing, in a third it forms a weapon of defence and offence, and in man it is a principal seat of the organ of touch. But if we examine the structure of this extremity in those several animals, we shall discover bones, muscles, nerves, vessels;

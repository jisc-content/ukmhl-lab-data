11 in fact, we shall find the same materials, and it depends solely upon their disposition to determine the nature of the function which the organ is destined to perform. The idea of unity in organic composition may appear defective, from the fact that it is only among the higher classes of animals that we can establish an analogy of organs; and further, that organs exist in the higher classes, the least vestiges of which are not to be found in the lower. This objection is, however, at once refuted, by observing, that though our mechanical and chemical examination will not enable us to detect many organs in many animals, it does not follow that these organs are altogether absent, for, at least, their rudiments may exist. Our inability to find bones, mus- cles, and nerves in the yolk and membrane of an egg does not imply the non-existence of, at least, their materials; it is rather an evidence of the inefficiency of our powers of investigation. Unity of organic composition being ad- mitted to exist, the almost infinite modifications of form and structure observable in organised bodies become an object of our attention ; and we are disposed to enquire, if there be not laws to regulate and determine these mani- fold varieties. Could the most beautiful part of the cre- ation have been abandoned to accident and chance, and left without a scheme to regulate and determine its for- mation ? What would maintain within their respective limits the vegetable and animal kingdoms, their classes, their genera, and their species? What would prevent one class from assuming the form of another, so that the animal kingdom would become an assemblage of irregularly shapen bodies ? The organized world would soon present nothing but confusion and disorder, if laws, fixed and immutable as those of unorganised matter, did not preside over the formation of living bodies, and did not maintain each of them within the limits which have been assipiied to it. It is by these laws, as you see them here classified,

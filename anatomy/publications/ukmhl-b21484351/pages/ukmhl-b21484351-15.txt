15 first period, the foetus presents a simple elongated body, in which neither the head nor the limbs are distinguishable: this condition would assign it no higher rank than that of worms or some moUusca. Shortly after, the head begins to appear, and the upper extremities shoot out, but the neck is wanting, and its absence, together with the prolongation of the lower end of the body into a sort of tail, render it analogous to fishes and reptiles. The inferior extremities next present themselves, but the caudal prolongation, which, however, afterwards disappears, con- fines its rank to that of quadrupeds. The external form runs rapidly through these several phases, so that at a very early period we can recognise the human shape : the individual organs are much slower in their develop- ment, and consequently their examination is much more satisfactory. When we examine the digestive tube, commencing with the mouth, we find that the nasal and buccal ca- vities are one in the first stage; they then begin to be separated one from the other by the horizontal plate, which afterwards forms the hard palate projecting from each side, and ultimately meeting in the central line; the soft palate is formed in the same manner, and, finally, its lateral portions unite at the same moment that a similar junction takes place in front between the halves of the upper lip. The analogy here is striking with the corres- ponding parts in the lower animals ; thus in birds, the late- ral halves of the hard palate are joined only in front, being separated behind ; the soft palate is wanting in birds and reptiles, and several animals of the higher classes have the upper lip divided, constituting what is called a harelip. This is a part which is not unfrequently arrested in its development, and we have children born not only with a harelip, but with a cleft palate. Proceeding to the intestinal tube, we find it, in the first period, shut at both extremities, and this is the con-

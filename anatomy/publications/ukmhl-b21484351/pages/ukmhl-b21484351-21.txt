21 certain of those parts above alluded to, more completely formed, but new and additional ones are superadded to occupy the centre of the organ. It is only at the very advanced period of foetal life that the nervous system of man acquires those characters in the possession of which he excels all other animals. Thus do we find that his brain, relatively with the nerves and spinal marrow, is greater than in all other animals. The spinal marrow, not occupying the entire length of the vertebral canal, the great size of the lateral lobes of the cerebellum compared with the central lobe, the volume of the hemispheres, their prolongation backwards, the number of convolu- tions and the depth of the sulci, the size of the corpus callosum and pons varolii, are all so many peculiarities of the human brain. This order of development is, how- ever, by no means unusually departed from in man, and those ill-formed beings are produced, termed monsters. Some are born wanting a brain altogether; in others we find certain portions of it deficient; others, again, present a redundancy of brain, or certain parts are developed beyond the proper standard, at the expence of some which are deficient. < Such is a cursory outline of the phenomena of develop- ment ; and in reviewing it, we are struck with the won- derful accordance in its laws with the order of the crea- tions that have taken place in successive remote periods of time. The Creator, in his wisdom, thought fit to people this world, in the first instance, with animals of the lowest order. Thus we find the remains of mollusca occupying some of the lowest strata in the fossil state. These passed away, and were succeeded by animals of a higher order, as birds and quadrupeds, whose remains are found in the more recent formations, and, last of all, was created man. In contemplating the scheme by which animated nature is ordained, we recognise that order, that system, and that regularity, which pervade the universe. We are

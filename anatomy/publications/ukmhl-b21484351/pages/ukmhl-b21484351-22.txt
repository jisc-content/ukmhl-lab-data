22 made sensible by observation, that there are certain laws which preside over the formation of hving beings; and further, we find that these laws are as immutable as those of inorganic matter. Their study affords a splendid field for our researches, and advances us in the only sure path by which we can ever hope to arrive at a knowledge of the laws of life. And, if ever we shall attain that end, how amply will it afford us the means of understanding and of mitigating disease; how rapidly will it hasten us to- wards the goal of our ambition, the object of our labours, —the alleviation of human sulferino;! But there is another subject to which our study of the development of the human body irresistibly leads, and cold and insensible must be the heart that warms not upon its reflection: it is the contemplation of that mind which first appears after birth, and then sets forward in the march of its development. The infant, at its first entrance into life, differs not in its intellectual powers, from the lowest quadruped. Through the medium of its senses, it first acquires a knowledge of physical pheno- mena; then gradually the light of intellect begins to dawn, sensations are converted into ideas, reason springs up, and reflection and education combine to foster, direct, and lead it to maturity. Aided by the virtues which have grown up with it, it is ■ enabled to combat and subdue those appetites and passions which are inseparable from our physical nature. The mind then prevails; purifies and refines, as it advances in its course; becomes every day more and more independent of its material vehicle ; and often, amid the ruin and dissolution of the body, preserves all its energies unimpaired, all its faculties clear and unclouded. May we not infer then, that the mind, during its connection with the body in life, its sojourn within this material frame, is passing through a phase in its existence; and that after death, purer in nature, and more exalted, it moves onwards towards the goal of its destiny,—complete development,—perfection?

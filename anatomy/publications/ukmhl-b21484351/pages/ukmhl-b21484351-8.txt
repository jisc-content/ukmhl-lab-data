8 the science of Anatomy has not been cultivated to any great extent in England. Our attention in this country has been principally directed to the study of that division of it termed Human Anatomy, which has been prosecuted with industry and success; and as its chief object is to afford us an acquaintance vi^ith the localities of the several organs of the body, Surgery, or the treatment of external diseases, has been carried to the highest degree of perfection amongst us. But to acquire a knowledge of the diseases of inter- nal organs,—those that are hidden from the observation of our senses,—we must know more than the mere localities : we must also learn the functions of those organs, for it is only from their derangement, those phenomena designated symptoms, that we are enabled frequently to recognize the nature and extent of internal disease. With this object in view, much more than the Anatomy of Man is necessary ; we must look abroad upon the wide field of animated beings, observe the common laws which govern their existence, and make organization generally the subject of our research.* It would be unnecessary on this occasion to dwell upon the distinctions, according to which the entire material world has been separated into the two great classes of organized and unorganized matter. For the purposes of this lecture it is sufficient to observe, that organized bodies which com- prise the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are distinguished from unorganized bodies by those actions which consti- tute, what in ordinary language is denominated, life. Un- organized bodies present comparatively but few pheno- mena : these have been seized by the genius of a Newton, * Verum ab humana anatomia Physiologia minime plena repetitur. Quotidie experior, de plerarumque partium corporis animalis func- tionibus non posse sincerum judicium ferri, nisi ejusdem partis fabrica et in horaine, et in variis quadrupedibus, et in avibus, et in piscibus, saepe etiam insectis, innotuerit.—Mailer, Elementa Physiologice.

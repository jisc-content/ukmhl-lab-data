9 whose vast intelligence regarded as nought the immea- surable distance of the heavenly bodies, when he made known the laws which govern their form, their relative positions, and their movements. Organized bodies, on the contrary, are so numerous, present such manifold varieties, from the humble coral up to perfect man, and are so complicated in the structure and arrangement of their several organs, that the mind almost sinks beneath the weight of detail; so that not one, but many Newtons have been required to determine the laws which the great Crea- tor has ordained for the formation and existence of ani- mated beings. Upon this subject considerable success has of late years attended the labours of our continental brethren : a Cuvier has exposed the remains of creations that existed in ages long passed away, and that are now buried within the earth, affording beneath our feet equally splendid illustrations, and equally absolute evidences of the creative powers of the Deity, as the heavenly bodies which exist above us. But it is to the labours of a GeofFroy and a Meckel that we are mainly indebted for the advancement of our views upon the laws of organization. It is chiefly from modern research that some light has been shed upon the darkness that hitherto has clouded all our knowledge of the phenomena of life ; that a new science has arisen for our enquiry, the cultivation of which may yet enable the human mind to comprehend the mysteries of the material frame it occupies. The first or grand principle upon which the laws of organization are founded is, that there is an unity of organic composition, at least in the higher classes of ani- mals, for as yet our knowledge does not establish it fully as regards the very lower. The great Newton, though the idea has been ascribed to others, recognised this impor- tant fact, when, extending his views of the uniformity which he discovered to exist in the planetary system, he observed, " Idemque did possit de unijormitate ilia quc&

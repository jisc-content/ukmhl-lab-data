18 to some other animal. In this manner we can account for what is of material importance to the surgeon, the variety so constantly met with in the course and distribution of arteries. After the circulatory, the next in point of importance is the respiratory system, but in its formation, the phases or degrees of development are by no means numerous. We can establish an analogy between the modes of res- piration of the foetus and of the lowest animals, by ob- serving, that in the former the function is performed by the membranes, and in the latter by the external envelope of the body. But the lungs themselves, not executing any office during uterine life, acquire almost at once the degree of development which they ultimately possess. In the frog, the respiratory system presents the greatest variety of conditions, for in the tadpole state the animal has gills to respire by, like the fishes ; and in the more advanced state, that of a frog, it possesses lungs like the higher animals. It is in the production of the nervous system, that which superintends, governs, and determines all the other organs, that we have the laws of formation best exempli- fied. The brain, the central organ, is developed in pro- portion to the system which it is intended to govern, and in the same ratio is the intelligence possessed by an animal, partially determined. In man, the brain arrives at the highest degree of organization, but the physical cha- racters which this great development confers upon him, are few and trifling, and will never explain the vast dis- proportion which exists between his spiritual mind and the intelligence of the very highest animals, those which approach him nearest in the perfection of their frame. The efforts of some modern theorists, who affect to make the brain the chief object of their research, to explain the phenomena of mind by referring them to the operations of matter, are weak and powerless ; and the sophistry by which these doctrines are concealed, is fully

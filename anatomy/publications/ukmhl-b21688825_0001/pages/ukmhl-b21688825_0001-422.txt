MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES'. 37 s fibula a little below its head; grows tendinous as it approaches the foot; then palling under the annular ligament and the crofs ligament of the foot, it goes onwards to the fecond joint of the toe over the firft. The fucceftion in which thefe mufcles lie under and behind each other is this: Firft, The tibialis anti- eus, the outermoft mufcle, arifes from the fore part of the tibia, neareft the fore part of the leg, at the ridge of the tibia : Secondly, The extenfor pollicis lies irg- mediately behind and under the tibialis anticus; Thirdly, The extenfor digitorum communis lies be- hind that: And, fourthly, The peroneus tertius lies behind the common extenfor like a part of that mufcle. Thefe extenfor tendons are bound down by crofs bands, refembling the annular ligaments of the wrift. The general fafcia of the thigh is continued over the knee and down the leg : it is much ftrengthened at the knee, where it adheres to each point of bone ; it defcends very thick and ftrong over the leg, binding down and ftrengthening the tibialis anticus and ex- tenfor mufcles. The fiieath grows thinner towards the ankle; but where it paffes over the joint, it is fo remarkably ftrengthened by its adhefions to the outer and inner ankles, that it feems to form two diftindl crofs bands, which, going from the point of the outer ankle acrofs the extenfor tendons to the point of the inner ankle, forms a ftrong crucial ligament, re- fembling the annular ligament of the wrift ; fo that this â– which is called the crucial ligament of the ankle or foot, is plainly but a ftrengthening of the common ftieath.

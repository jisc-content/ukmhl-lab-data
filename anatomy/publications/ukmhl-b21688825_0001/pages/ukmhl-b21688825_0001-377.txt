GENERATION, ANUS, AND PERINEUM. 333 prefenting its origin from the pelvis, the narrower part its infertion into the anus. The whole bladder is fur- rounded and covered by this mufcle; the urethra paffes through a fplit in its fibres ; and no operation of lithotomy can reach the bladder from below without cutting through this mufcle. It raifes the anus, and at the fame time dilates it; opening the anus for the paflage of the feces, and fupporting it, fo as to pre- vent its being protruded. Thus it is not for (hutting the anus, as fome have fuppofed, but is the direct an- tagonifl of the fphinbter ani mufcle. By enclofing the bladder, the levator ani adds upon it alfo ; for the neck of the bladder palling through a Hit in its fibres, while the levator ani is afting, this flit is drawn, as it were, round the neck of the bladder, and fo the urine is for the time prevented from flowing. It is as a fphinctey to the bladder, which prevents our palling the urine and feces at the fame moment. By furrounding the lower part of the bladder, and enclofing the proflaie gland, and the veficufe feminales, which lie upon the back of the bladder, this mufcle affects thefe parts alfo; and is perhaps the only mufcle which may be fuppofed to empty the veficufe, or to ccmprefs the gland, pul- ling upwards at the fame time, fo as to prefs the back of the penis againft the pubis, to maintain the erection, and to aflift the accelerator mufcles. By enclofing the bladder, veficufe, proflate, and a-nus, this mufcle produces that fympathy among the parts which is of- ten very diftrefling ; as in gonorrhoea, the (tone in the bladder, conflipation, piles, and other difeafes of thefe parts : for piles, conflipation, or any caufe which may excite the ablion of the levator mufcles, will caufe ere&ions,

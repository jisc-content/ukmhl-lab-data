54 DESCRIPTION OF THE The which have arifen from this artery when wounded near its hole; and of the convulfions, jialfies, and lofs of fight, which have arifen from the accidents, wounds, or lacerations of this frontal nerve : Thefe ftories are delivered on authorities which we dare not refufe, and yet they are fuch as we cannot eafily believe. This orbitary, or fuperciliary ridge, ends by two procefles, which, forming the angles of the eye, are named the angular processes. The frontal bone has therefore four angular procefles : i. The two internal angular procefles, forming the internal angles of the eyes ; and, 2. The two external angular pro- cefles which form the external angles of each eye. Behind each external angular procefs, the bone lies flat, and funk into a hollow which lodges the tem- poral mufcles; and betwixt the two internal angular proceffes there is the nasal point or process. This nafal procefs is a fmall fharp projecting point, which is exaCtly in the middle of the bone, occupying that fpace which is betwixt the two internal angular pro- cefles. It is very irregular and rough all round its root, for fupporting the two fmall nafal bones ; and this gives them a firm feat, and fuch a hold upon the. root of the forehead, that they will be fooner broken than difplaced. At the inner end of the fuperciliary ridge, is that bump which marks the place of the frontal finufes : it alfo in fome degree indicates their fize; for where this rifing is not found, the finufes are awanting, or are very fmall, but this is no fure, nor abfolute mark of the prefence of thefe finufes, which often, in the; flattefl; foreheads, are not entirely awanting.

MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 283 but a produdtion of it flill goes forward to the fecond bone of the little-finger. Its ufe is to fpread the little-finger fidewife, and perhaps to aflifl the flexors. CVIII. The flexor parvus minimi digiti is a fmall thin mufcle which rifes by the fide of the lafl, and runs the fame courfe, with nearly the fame infertion. Its origin is from the ligament of the wrift, and in part from the crooked procefs of the cuneiform bone. Its ufe is to bend the little-finger. And indeed the office and place of both is fo much the fame, that I have marked the laft as a flexor; and the little differ- ence there is, is only that this performs a more direct flexion. CIX. The adductor minimi digiti is fometimes called the metacarpal of the little-finger. It lies im- mediately under the former mufcle. Its origin is from the hook of the cuneiform bone and the adjoin- ing part of the carpal ligament. It is inferted into the outfide of the metacarpal bone, which it reaches by turning round it. Its ufe is to put the little-finger antagonifl to the others: it is to this finger what the opponents is to the thumb. It alfo, by thus bending one bone of the metacarpus, affe&s the whole, increafes the hollow and external convexity of the carpus, and forms what is called Diogenesâ€™s cup. CX. The abductor indicis is a flat mufcle of con- fiderable breadth, lying behind the addu&or pollicis, and exactly refembling it, being like the fecond layer. It arifes from the os trapezium, and from the firfl bone of the thumb; and it is inferted into the back part of the firfl bone of the finger, and pulls the fore- finger towards the thumb. The

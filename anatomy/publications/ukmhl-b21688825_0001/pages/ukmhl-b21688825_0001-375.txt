GENERATION, ANUS, AND PERINJEUM. 331 nosi, from their origin in the ifchium, ajid their infer- tion into the cavernous bodies. CLI. The transversal is perin^ei is often named tranfverfalis penis; but its origin being in the tubero- fity of the os ifchium, by a delicate tendon, and its in- fertion into the very backmoft point of the bulb of the urethra, where it touches the anus, its courfe is di- rectly acrofs the perinsemn ; and its relation to the pe- rinseum and anus is very direct and evident, while its relation to the penis is rather doubtful. Often there is a fecond mufcle of the fame origin and infertion running like this acrofs the perinaeum, named trans- VERSALIS PERIN^EI ALTER. This tranfverfe mufcle may, by bracing up the bulb to the arch of the pubis, have fome effedt in {topping the vein on the back of the penis, and fo producing ereÂ£tion ; but its chief ufe muft be in preventing the anus from being too much protruded in difcharging the faeces, and in retracing it when it is already pro- truded. CLII. The accelerator mufcle is not a fingle muf- cle, as it is often defcribed : it is manifestly a pair of mufcles furrounding the whole of the bulb of the ure- thra. For there is along the lower face of the bulb a white and tendinous line, correfponding with the out- ward line or feam of the perinseum. This line diftin- guilhes the bellies of the two mufcles : the fibres of each fide furround their proper half of the bulb with circular fibres, winding obliquely round the bulb ; and each mufcle ends in its feparate tendon, which is de- licate and fmall, and which, leaving the bulb of the ure- thra, turns off obliquely to the fide ; fo that the tendon , of

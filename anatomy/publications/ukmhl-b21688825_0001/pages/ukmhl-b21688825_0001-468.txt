454 JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE. deed ftrengthened at certain points into the thicknefs of a ligament; but the only clofe connexion of the fpinal marrow with the ligaments of the fpine is juft at the hole of the occipital bone, and for a little way down; through all the reft of the fpine, the connec- tion is by the loofeft cellular fubftance. OF THE LOWER JAW. ' The lower jaw is, by its natural form, almoft a ftriQ: hinge, and the lateral motion in grinding is but very flight. The joint is formed by a deep hollow or focket in the temporal bone; by a ridge, which ftands juft before the proper focket, at the root of the zygo- matic procefs; and by a long fmall head or condyle, which is placed acrofs the long branch or condyloid procefs of the jaw. Thefe form the joint; and_ the con- dyle, the hollow of the temporal bone, and the root of the zygomatic procefs, are all covered with articu- lating cartilage. The joint is completed by a capfule of the common form, which arifes from the neck of the condyle, and which is fo fixed into the temporal bone as to include both the proper focket and the root of the zygomatic procefs. Thence it is manifeft, that in the motions of the jaw, this tranfverfe ridge is required as a part of its articulating furface; that the common and lefler motions are performed by the condyle mo- ving in the deepeft part of its focket; that the larger and wider openings of the mouth are performed by fuch depreflion of the jaw as makes its condyle mount upon the root of the zygomatic procefs; while the luxation of the jaw is a ftarting forwards of the con- dyle, til! it is lodged quite before and under the zygo- matic

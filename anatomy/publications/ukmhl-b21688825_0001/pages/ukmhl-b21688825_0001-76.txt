32 of The formation1 this conftitution of a bone, we can eafily forefee how the callus for uniting broken bones mull be formed ; ndt by a mere coagulation of extravafated juice, but by a new organization refembling the original bone. The primordium of all the parts of the body is a thin gelatinous mucus, in which the forms of the parts are laid; and the preparation for healing wounds, and for every new part that needs to be formed, is a fecretion of mucus which is foon animated by veffels coming into it from every point. In every external wound, in every internal inflammation, wherever ex- ternal parts are to be healed, or internal vifcera are about to adhere, a mucous matter is fecreted, which ferves as a bed or nidus, in which the veflfels fpread from point to point, till the mucus is animalized and converted into a membrane : And thus the heart, the inteftines, the tefticle, and other parts, adhere by in- flammation to the coats which furround them, and which are naturally loofe. - It is a mucus of the fame form which unites the ends of a broken bone ; and, by breaking the bones of animals, and attending to the progrefs of the callus, we find firfl: a thin mucus ; then that thickened into a tranfparent gelly ; that gelly growing vafcular, and thefe veffels gradually depofiting nuclei of oflification in the centre of the mafs ; and by madder, or by fine injections, we can make the gelly appear vafcular, and the nuclei of oflification quite red. The colours of our injections begin to tinge the carti- lage as it begins to oflify, and as foon as the oflification is general, it receives a general tinge. Now when we find the fubftance of the oldefl: bone thus full of veffels, why fhould we doubt of its being able

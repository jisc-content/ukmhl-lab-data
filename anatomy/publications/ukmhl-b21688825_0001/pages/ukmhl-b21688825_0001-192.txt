The thigh-bone is one of the Inoft regular of the cylindrical bones. 1. Its body is very thick and ftrongj of a rounded form ; fwelling out at either end into two heads. In its middle it bends a little outwards, with its circle or convex fide turned towards the fore part of the thigh. This bending of the thigh-bone has been a fubject of fpeculation abundantly ridiculous, viz. whether this be an accidental or a natural arch. There are authors who have afcribed it to the nurfe carrying the child by the thighs, and its foft bones bending under the weight. There is another author, very juftly celebrated, who imputes it to the weight of the body and the ftronger aftion of the flexor muf- cles; affirming, that it is ftraight in the child, and grows convex by age. This could Hot be, elfe we fhould find this curve lefs in fome, and greateft in thofe who had walked moft, or whofe mufcles had the greateft ftrength ; and if the mufcles did produce this curve, a little accident giving the balance to the flexor mufcles fhould put the thigh-bone in their power to bend it in any degree, and to caufe diftortion. But the end of all fuch (peculations is this, that we find it bended in the foetus not yet delivered from the mo- therâ€™s womb, or in a chicken while ftill enclofed in the fhell; it is a uniform and regular bending, de- figned

THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT, I 53 when the trochanter is higher than its true place, and fo fixed that it cannot roll, we are allured that it is luxated upwards ; but when the trochanter is higher than its true place, with the thigh rolling freely, we are aflured its neck is broken, the trochanter being difplaced, and the broken head remaining in its focket; but when the trochanter remains in its place, we fhould conclude that the joint is but little injured, or that it is only a bruife of thofe glands or mucous fol- licles which are lodged within the focket for lubricat- ing the joint. The tibia is named from it refemblance to a pipe; the upper part of the tibia, representing the expanded or trumpet-likc end, the lower part reprefenting the flute end of the pipe. The tibia, on its upper end, is flat and broad, making a moll Angular articulation with the thigh-bone; for it is not a ball and focket like the flioulder or hip, nor a hinge joint guarded on either fide with projecting points like the ankle. There is jio fecurity for the knee joint by the form of its bores, for they have plain flat heads : they are broad indeed, but they are merely laid upon each other. It is only by its ligaments that this joint is firong ; and by the number of its ligaments it is a complex and delicate joint peculiarly liable to difeafe. I. The upper head of the tibia is thick and fpongy, and we find there two broad and fuperficial hollows, as if imprefled while foft, with the marks of the condyles of the thigh-bone; and thefe flight hollows are all the cavity that it has for receiving the thigh- bone. A pretty high ridge rifes betwixt thefe two hollows,

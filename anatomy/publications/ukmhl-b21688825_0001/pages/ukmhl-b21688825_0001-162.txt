JlS OF THE TRUNK. we nerves of the fpine; or rather forty-eight nerves, twenty-four being given towards each fide, Thefe • nerves pafs each through an opening or fmail hole in the general fheath, and then they pafs through the interflice of each vertebra; fo that there is no hole in the bone required, but the nerve efcapes by going under the articulating procefs. This, indeed, is con- verted into fomething like a hole when the two con- tiguous vertebrae are joined to each other. THE INTERVERTEBRAL SUBSTANCE— The intervertebral fubftance is that which is interpofed betwixt the bodies of two adjoining vertebrae, and' which is (at lead; in the loins) nearly equal in thick- nefs to the body of the vertebra to which it belongs. We give it this undefined name, becaufe there is no- thing in the human fyftem to which it is. entirely fi- milar; for it is not ligament, nor is it cartilage, but if is commonly defined to be fomething of an intermediate nature. It is a foft and pliant fubftance, which is cu- rioully folded and returned upon itfelf, like a rolled bandage with folds, gradually fofter towards the cen- tre, and with the rolled edges as if cut obliquely into a fort of convex. The cut edges are thus turned to- wards the furfaoe of the vertebra, to which the in- tervertebral fubftance belongs : It adheres to the face of each vertebra, and it is confined by a ftrong liga- ment all round. And this fubftance, though it ftill keeps its hold on each of the two vertebras to which it belongs; though it permits no true motion of one bone on another, but only by a twilling of its fub- ftance j yields, neverthelefs, eafily to which ever fide

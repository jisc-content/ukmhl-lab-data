MUSCLES OF THE thin tendon, which belongs equally to both bellies, lies above the true pericraneum, and Aides upon it. The mufcle is therefore named, with drift propriety, occi- pito-frontalis, fometimes epicraneus, fometimes BIVENTER, or DIGASTRICUS CAPITIS. Origin.—The occipital portion is the fixed point of th's mufcle; arifing from the upper ridge of the oc- cipital bone, and covering the back part of the head, from the maftoid procefs of one fide, round to that on the oppofite fide of the head. And by the perpendi- cular ridge of the occiput, it is marked with a fiight divifion in the middle. Insertion.—The fore belly of the mufcle which covers the forehead, is fixed more into the fidn and eye brows than into the bone: it is Aightly attached to the bone, near the inner end of the orbitary ridge, and efpecially about the inner corner of the eye, and the root of the nofe, by a fmaller and acute pointed procefs; but dill its chief attachment is to the eye-lids and fidn. TheTENDONor thin membraneousexpanfionwhich joins the two bellies, is exceedingly thin : it has on its inner fide much loofe cellular fubdance, by which, though attached to the true pericraneum, it Aides ea- fily and fmoothly upon it; but its outer furface is fo firmly attached to the fidn, and its fore belly adheres fo firmly to the eye-brows, that it is yery difficult to diffeft it clean and fair. I confider the occipital belly as the fixed point, having a firm origin from the ridge of the bone; its frontal belly has the loofe end attached, not to the os frontis, but to the eye-brow and fkinj and its office is to

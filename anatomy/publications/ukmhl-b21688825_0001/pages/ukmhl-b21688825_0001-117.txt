individual bones of the skull. 73 ing tranfmits the eighth nerve of the Ikull, or par va- gum which goes down towards the ftomach, along with the jugular vein. There is a fmall furrow upon the very angle or ridge of the petrous bone, which is made by a fmall vein of the brain going towards the end of the lateral 'linus. 3. There is a fmall hole on the outfide of this bone, in the occipital angle; or rather the hole is oftener found in the line of the future (the additamentum fu- ture fquamofse). Sometimes it is in the occipital bone; or fometimes it is awanting: it tranfmits a trifling vein from without, into the great finus, or a fmall artery going to the dura mater. That hollow under the root of the zygomatic pro- cefs, which lodges the hinge of the jaw-bone, mull be defcribed along with the lower jaw. The iETHMOID BONE.—This is perhaps one of the moll curious bones of the human body. It appears almoll a cube, not of folid bone, but exceedingly light, fpongy, and confilling of many convulated plates, which form a net-work like honey comb, It is curioufly in- clofed in the os frontis, betwixt the orbitary procefles of that bone. One horizontal plate receives the olfaftory nerves, which perforate that plate with fuch a number of fmall holes, that it refembles a fieve; whence the • bone is named cribriform, or asthmoid bone. Other , plates dropping perpendicularly from this one, receive the divided nerves, and give them an opportunity of expanding into the organ of fmelling; and thefe bones, upon which the olfaflory nerves are fpread out, are fo much convoluted, as to extend the furface of this

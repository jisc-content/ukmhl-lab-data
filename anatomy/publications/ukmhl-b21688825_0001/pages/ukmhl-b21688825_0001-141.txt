OF THE FACE AND JAWS. 9JT vol. i. h tril, tindt, formed a part, and connected in a very flight way with the upper jaw-bones. The ossa spongiosa inferiora, are two bones, much rolled or convoluted; very fpongy; of a light and fcaly appearance, with holes and an appearance of net-work refembling the fponginefs of puffed pafle, fo that they are exceedingly light. They lie rolled up in the lower part of the nofe; are particularly large in fheep; are eafily feen either in the entire fubjedi, or in the naked fkull. Their point forms that projection, which is touched with the finger in picking the nofe ; and from that indecent pradtice, very often ferious con- fequences arife, for in many inflances, polypi of the lower fpongy bones, which can be fairly traced to hurts of this kind, grow fo, as to extend down the throat, caufing fuffocation and death. One membrane conftitutes the univerfal lining of the cavities of the nofe, and the coverings of all the fpongy bones. This continuity of the membrane, pre- vents our feeing in the fubjedt, how flightly the fpongy bones are hung; but in the bare and diffedted fkull, we find a neat fmall hook upon the fpongy bone, by which it is hung upon the edge of the antrum maxillare; for this lower fpongy bone is laid upon the fide of the antrum fo as to help the palate bone, in clofing or covering that cavity from within. One end of the fpongy bone, rather more acute, is turned towards the opening of the noflril, and covers the end of the lachrymal dudt: the other end of the fame bone, points backwards towards the threat. The curling plate, hangs down into the cavity of the nof-

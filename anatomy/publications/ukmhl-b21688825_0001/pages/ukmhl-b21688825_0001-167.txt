123 ©E THE TRUNK. planted into the interface betwixt two vertebae; the head touching both vertebrae; and each vertebra bear- ing the mark of two ribs, one above, and one beiow. The mark of the rib is on the edge of either vertebra, and the focket may be faid to lie in the intervertebral fubftance betwixt them. 2. The neck of the rib is a fmaller part, immediate- ly before the head. Here the rib is particularly fmall and round. 3. About an inch from the head, there is a fecond rifing, or bump, the articulating furface, by which it touches and turns upon the tranfverfe procefs. Thefe two articulations have each a diftinft capfule or bag ; each is a very regular Joint; and the degree of motion of the rib, and direction in which it moves, may be eafily calculated, from the manner in which it is joint- ed with the fpine. For the two articulating furfaces of the rib ar® on its back part; the back of the rib is lim- ply laid upon the fide of the fpine ; the joints, with the body of the vertebrae, and with its tranfverfe procefs, are in one line, and form as if but one joint; fo that the rib being fixed obliquely, and at one end only, that end continues firm, except in turning upon its axis; the two heads roll upon the body of the vertebrae, and up- on the tranfverfe procefs; and fo its upper end con- tinues fixed, while its lower end rifes or falls ; and as the motion is in a circle, the head being the central point, moves but little, while the lower end of the rib has the wildeft range. 4. Juft above the fecond articulating furface, there is a third tubercle, which has nothing to do with the joints, but is intended merely for the attachment of the 6 ligaments

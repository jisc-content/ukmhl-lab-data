The fecurity of the hip-joint feems to depend tnore upon the flrength of its capfular ligament than that of almoft any other joint. THE KNEE-JOINT. The knee-joint is one of the moft fuperficial joints and one of the weakeft, fo far as relates to the bones; for the flat condyles of the thigh-bone are merely laid up- on the flat head of the tibia. There is here no fair ca- vity receiving a large head, as in the joint of the hip : no flighter ball and focket, as in the fingers ; no firong overhanging bones, as in the fhoulder ; no hook-like procefs, as in the ulna. This is not a hinge-joint, like the ankle, fecured between two points of bone. We do not find the means of flrength in its bones, but in the number, fize, and difpofition of the great liga- ments with which its bones are joined; by virtue of thefe ligaments it is the ftrongeft joint of the human body, the moil opprelfed by great loads, the moft exer- cifed in continual motions, yet lefs frequently difplaced than any other. But this complication of ligaments, which gives it mechanical flrength, is the very caufe of its conflitutional weaknefs; makes it very delicate j and very liable to difeafe. The bones which compofe this joint are the tibia, thigh-bone, and patella; and they are united by many ligaments, both within and without the joint. ift. The capsule of the knee is naturally very thin and delicate, tranfparent as a cobweb. This thin cap- fuie comes from the fore part of the thigh-bone, all round the articulating furfaces, whence it goes down- wards

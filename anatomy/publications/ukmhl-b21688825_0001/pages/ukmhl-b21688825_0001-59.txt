AND GROWTti OF BONES. 15 layers, layers, which were added to the bone, it was his bufmefs to prove that the fucceffive layers would be depofited alternately red, white, and red again, by giv- ing a young animal madder, withholding it for a little while, and then beginning again to give it. Now, it is eafy to forefee that this tinging of the laipells Ihould correfpond with the fucceffive times in which the periodeum is able to depofite the layers of its fub- dance ; but Du Hamel very thoughtlefsly makes his layers correfpond only with the weeks or months in which his madder was given or withheld. It is eafy to forefee alfo, that if madder be removed from the bones in a few days (which he himfelf has often told us), then his fil'd layer, viz. of red bone, could not have waited for his layer of white to be laid above it, nor for a layer of red above that again, fo as to enable him to lhew fucceffive layers : And if madder can fo penetrate, as to tinge all the bones that are already- formed, then, though there might be fird a tinged bone, then a white and colourlefs layer, whenever he proceeded to give madder for tinging a third layer, it would pervade all the bone, tinge the layer below, and reduce the whole to one tint. If a bone were thus to increafe by layers, thick enough to be vifible, and of a didinft tint 5 and if fuch layers were to be con- tinually accumulated upon each other every week, what kind of a bone fhould this grow to ? Yet fuch is the fafcinating nature of a theory, that Du Hamel, un- mindful of any interruptions like thefe, defcribes bold- ly his fucceffive layers 5 carrying us through regular details, experiment after experiment, till at lad he brings up his report to the amount of five fucceffive

AND GROWTH OF BONES. 2 7 The to the heads of the bones, as of the fhoulder, or of the thigh-bones; and there the periofteum adheres very ftrongly: and every where on its furface the bone is fupplied by numerous veffels from the periofteum (and this feems, indeed, to be the chief ufe of that mem- brane) ; fo that in tearing off the periofteum, the fur- face of the membrane, and of the bone, are feen co- vered with bloody points; all the veffels are conduc- ed to the fubftance of the bone by its two membranes : the internal veffels by the membrane which lines the cavity, and which is known by the abfurd name of in- ternal periofteum ; the external one by the outer membrane, the proper or external periofteum. The internal periofteum is that membrane which furrounds the marrow, and in the bags of which the marrow is formed and contained. It is more connect- ed with the fat than with the bone; and in animals, can be drawn out entire from the cavity of the bone : but its chief ufe is to conduCt the veffels which are to enter into the fubftance of the bone ; and this con- nection and office is fo effential to the life and health of the bone, that the fpina ventofa, or fcrophulous bone, is merely a failure of the internal circulation, a total corruption of the marrow, and a confequent lofs of the medullary veffels ; by which the whole bone dies, is thrown out by nature, or more frequently the limb muft be cut off. The fame effeCt is produced in our experiments, where by piercing into the medul- lary cavity, and deftroying the marrow, the ffiaft of the bone dies, while the heads and proceffes live, merely becaufe they are fupplied more fully by their external veffels.

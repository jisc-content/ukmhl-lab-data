INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. 6j The temporal mufcle is flrengthened by a firm co- vering of tendon, which flretches from the upper edge of this zygoma to the white line on the parietal bone ; and feveral mufcles of the face arife from the lower edge of the zygoma, particularly one named maffiter, which moves the jaw 5 and one named zygomaticus, or diflortor oris, becaufe it draws the angle of the mouth. The zygomatic procefs is united by a fhort future to the cheek-bone. 2. The styloid process, is fo named from a flight refemblance to the fly 1 us, or point with which the ancients engraved their writings on tables of wax. It is cartilaginous long after birth ; even in the adult, it is not completely formed ; it is exceedingly delicate and fmall; and when its cartilaginous point is fairly oflified, as in old men, it is fometimes two inches long. It Hands obliquely out from the bafis of the head, and is behind the jaw ; fo that it gives con- venient origin to a ligament which goes downwards to fupport the os hyoides, or bone of the tongue j and it is the origin of many curious mufcles, chiefly of the throat and jaws. One flender mufcle going down- wards from the flyloid procefs, and expanding over the pharynx, is called flylo-pharingeus ; one going to the os hyoides, is the flylo-hyoideus ; one going to the tongue, is the flylo-gloffus ; and fince the procefs is above and behind thefe parts, the mufcles mufl all pull backwards and upwards, raifing according to their infertions, one the pharynx, another the os hyoides, another the tongue. 3. The vaginal process will not be eafily founds nor acknowledged as a procefs ; for it is only a fmall riling of a ridge of the bone, with a rough and bro- F 2 ken-

BONES OF THE, &C. 190 fecond and third joints of the fingers are gradually fmaller, and though their forms do a good deal re- ferable the firfl joint, they are quite limited in their motions; have no rolling ; are as ftridtly hinge-joints as the knee or ankle are. 3. Here, as in other hinge- joints, the capfule is fo particularly ftrong at the Tides, as to be named lateral ligaments. When thefe lateral ligaments are burft or cut, the finger turns in any di- rection ; fo that the motions of the fingers are limited rather by their lateral ligaments, than by any thing peculiar in the forms of the bones. 4. The face of each finger bone is grooved, fo that the tendons, paf- fing in the palm of the hand, run upwards along this groove or flatnefs of the fingers; and from either edge of this flatnefs, there rifes a ligament of a bridge-like form, which covers the tendons like a Iheath, and con- verts the groove into a complete canal. 5. The laft joint or phalanx of each finger is flattened, rough, and drawn fmaller gradually towards the point of the fin- ger j and it is to this roughnefs that the Ikin and nail adhere at the point.

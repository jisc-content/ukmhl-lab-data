MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. 34I CLVIIL The psoas parvus does not, like this, be- long to the thigh, but is a mufcle of the loins which arifes along with this one from the laft vertebra of the back and the firft of the loins. It is a fmall and deli- cate mufcle; ends in a (lender tendon,which goes down by tfie innffr fide of the great pfoas, but does not go out of the pelvis along with it: it flops fliort. and is implanted into the brim of the pelvis, into the os ilium, near the place of the acetabulum; it bends the fpine upon the pelvis. This mufcle is more regular in the monkey: in the dog it is feldom awanting. It is faid to be more frequently found in women than in men: in both it often is not to be found; but fome- times in flrong and big men three pfoas mufcles have been found. CLIX. The iliacus internus is a thick, very flefhy, and fan-like mufcle, which occupies the whole concavity of the os ilium. Its origin is from the internal lip of the crifla ilii ? ft adheres to all the concave furface of that bone down to the brim of the pelvis; to the fore part of the bone under the fpinous procefs; and to a part alfo of the capfular ligament of the joint: all its ra- diated fibres are gathered together into a tendon at the ligament of Paupart, This tendon is longer on the lower than on the upper furface; for below it Hides on the pubis as upon a pulley, and continues tendi- nous, that it may bear the friction; but above it is unconnected, or it is connected only by loofe cellular fubftance ; and there it is quite flefhy. Juft under the ligament the two tendons are joined; whence they z 3 bend

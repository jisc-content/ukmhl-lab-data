OF THE FORMATION 22 and heads is beginning to form; they continue three dif- tinct bones, during all the early part of life, and are eafily feparated, by foaking the bone in water ; when they are feparated, there is feen a rough hollow on the furface of the epiphyfis, or feparated head, and a rough convexity on the end of the body: they are finally united into one bone, about the twentieth year. In the original cartilage, there is no hollow, nor ca- vity ; it is all one folid mafs. When the offification firft appears, the cavity of the bone alfo begins, and ex- tends with the offification. At firft, the cavity is con- fined chiefly to the middle of the bone, and extends very flowly towards the ends. This cavity, in the centre of the bone, is at firft fmooth, covered by an inter- nal membrane, containing the trunks and branchings of the nutritious veffels, which enter by a great hole, in the middle of the bone; and the cavity is traverfed, with divifions of its lining membrane, which, like a net-work of partitions, conduct its branches to all parts of the internal furface of the bone; and its nets, or mefhes, are filled with a reddifh and ferous fluid, in the young bone, but fecrete and contain a perfedt marrow in the adult bone. The whole fubftance of a bone is not only fibrous, as appears outwardly, but is truly lamellated, con* filling of many diftindt and delicate plates of bone ; which lie over each other in regular order, and might fuggeft the notion that fucceffive offifica- tions of the periofteum form the bone. Thefe la- mellae, or plates, are more condenfed and firmer to- wards the outer furface ; and are more loofe, feparate, and fpongy, towards the internal furface of the bone :

OF THE BONES 93 fpect of all the circumflances. The difeafe is not to be eafily nor certainly difcovered ; but a very long con- tinued toothach, an uncommon degree of pain, or greater affection of the eye, with a fwelling and red- nefs, and gradual rifing of the cheek, are very fufpi- cious figns. The pulling of the fecond or third of the grinding teeth, often brings a fplinter away with N it, which opens a road for the matter to flow; or ■ though there be no breach of the focket, often the confined matter follows the teeth, 'becaufe not unfre- quently the longer fangs of the grinders naturally penetrate quite into this cavity of the jaw : if the mat- ter fhould not flow, the floor of the antrum is eafily perforated, by introducing a fharp ftillet by the focket of the tooth that is pulled. The flow of the matter gives relief, and injections of various medicines com- plete the cure. But as this opening is fometimes 9, cure, it is fometimes alfo a difeafe; for the breaking of a focket, fometimes opening a way into this an- trum, there follows inflammation of its internal furface, a running of matter, and fometimes caries of the bone. Holes.—The holes of the jaw-bone are two only : x. The infR.A-ORbitary hole, for tranfmitting the infra-orbitary nerve from the bottom of the eye, comes along under the eye in a bony groove, and makes generally one large round hole on the cheek, juft under the margin of the orbit, or fometimes the nerve divides and makes two fmaller holes in its paflage upon the cheek ; and, 2.

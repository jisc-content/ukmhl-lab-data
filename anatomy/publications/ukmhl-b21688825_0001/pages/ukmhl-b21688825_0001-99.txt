INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. 55 The finufes * of the os frontis are two in number, â– one on either fide above the root of the nofe : They are formed by a receding of the two tables of the fkull from each other: they are formed at firft with the common cancelli, and at firft: they refemble the common cancelli, as if they were only larger cells: gradually they enlarge into two diftindt cavities, often of very confiderable fize; goii g down into the orbi- tary plate, or fidewife into the orbit, ry ridge, or up- wards through one half of the frontal bone; and Ruifch had, in a giantefs (puella gigantica), feen them pafs the coronal future, and extend fome way into the parietal bones. The finufes of either fide are feparated by a par- tition ; but ftill they communicate by a fmall hole: fometimes the partition is almoft awanting, and there are only erodings of the common lamellated fub- ftance ; and though the communication with one an- other is not always found, they never fail to communi- cate with the nofe. This indeed feems to be their chief ufe; for the frontal finufes are the beginning of a great train of cells, which, commencing thus in the frontal bone, extend through the aethmoidal, fphenoidal, and maxillary bones, fo as to form an organ of great extent * The word Sinus is ufed in two fenfes : we call the cavities' or cells within the fubftance of the bone, the finufes of that bone ; as the finufes of the forehead, of the fphenoid, asthmoid, or maxil- lary bones: we call alfo certain great veins by the fame name of finufes: Thus the great veins being enlarged where they ap- proach the heart, and the Ww being particularly large in the brajn and the womb, we call them the finufes of the heart, of the brain, and of the womb.

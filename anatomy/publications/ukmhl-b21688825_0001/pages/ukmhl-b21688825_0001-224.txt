18 b BONES OF THE 5. The ulna, bigger at the elbow, grows gradually fmaller downwards, till it terminates a 1 mo ft in a point. It ends below in a fmall round head, which, is named the tower head of the ulna, which fcarce- ly enters into the joint of the wrift; but being re- ceived into a hollow on the fide of the radius, the ra- dius turns upon the lower head of the ulna like an- axis or fpoke. 6. Below this little head, the bone ends towards the fide of the little finger in a fmall rounded point, which is named the styloid process of the ulna, and which is chiefly ufeful in giving a ftrong adhefion to the ligament which fecures the wrift there. And as the fty- loid proeefs and the olecranon, the two extremities of the ulna, are eafily and diftinctly felt, the length of this bone has been ufed as a meafure; and fo it was named cubitus by the ancients, and is named ulna by us. Radius. The radius is the fecond bone of the ford arm, has its pofition exactly reverfed with that of the ulna: for the ulna belonging to the elbow has its great- er end upwards ; the radius belonging to the wrift has its greater end downwards; and while the ulna only bends the arm, the radius carries the wrift with a ro- tatory motion; and fo entirely belongs to the wrift, that it is called the manubrium manus, as if the handle of the hand. 1. The body of the radius is larger than that of the ulna. The tranfverfe ftrength of the arm depends more upon the radius, which has more body and thicknefs; is more fquared; and is arched, in fome degree, fo as to ftand off from the ulna, without ap- proaching it, or compreffing the other parts.

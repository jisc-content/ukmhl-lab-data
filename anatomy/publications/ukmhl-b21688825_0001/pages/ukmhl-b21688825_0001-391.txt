MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. 347 ing and oblique dire&ion down to the thigh-bone; and, being gathered into a flat and pretty broad tendon, it is inferted into the root of the trochanter major, and down three inches of the linea afpera. This is one of the largeft and moft flefhy mufcles of the body; covers all the other mufcles of the hip; forms the contour of the hip; pulls the thigh backwards, or the body forwards upon the thigh when the thigh is fixed: and being a wide fpreading mufcle, which in a manner furrounds its joint, its different portions ad with different effects; not only according to their na- tural direction, but according to the accidental pofi- tions of the pelvis with regard to the thigh-bone. CLXIV. TheGLUTiEUs medius or minor is fmaller than the former, but like it. It arifes from all the outfide of the ilium not occupied by the glutasus ma- jor. It, like the other, is a fan-formed mufcle; for its fibres converge from its broad origin in all the back of the ilium, to form a fhort flat tendon, which is inferted into the back or into the very top of the great trochanter. It lies in part under the glutaeus maximus; but its- chief part lies before the glutaeus maximus: and as certain portions of the mufcle are before the thigh-bone, there are pofitions of the pelvis and thigh-bone in which it will pull the thigh for- wards, although its proper office is to affift the glu- taeus magnus in pulling the thigh backwards, and moving it outwards from the body. CLXV. The gluteus Minimus is a fmall radiated mufcle, which lies deep, and quite under the former. It has, compared with the former, a very narrow origin ; for it arifes chiefly from the lowed part of the back of the

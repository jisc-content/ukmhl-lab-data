44Â© JOINTS OF THE ginjEi transversale *. The capfular ligament of th* hip-joint is the thickeft and ftrongeft of all the body. It is, like other capfules, a reflection and thickening of the periofteum; the periofteum coming along the out- fide of the bone, leaves it at the edge of the focket. The periofteum, or rather perichondrium from the in- fide of the focket, comes up to the edge, and meets the outer layer. They unite together, fo as to form the general capfule, encloflng the ring-like cartilage, which tips the edge of the focket between them. This ligament enclofes all the bones from the edges of the focket to the roots of the trochanters, embracing not only the head but the neck of the thigh-bone. The outer plate, continuous with the periofteum, is thick and ftrong, and is aflifted by much cellular fubftance condenfed round it, and it is further thickened by flips which come from the iliacus, glutseus, and other muf- cles which pafs over the joint, while the external plate of the ligament lines the whole with a foft and well lubricated coat. In addition to this general capfule, there are two in- ternal ligaments, ift, The round ligament, as it is call- ed, which comes from the centre of the focket to be fixed into the centre of the ball of the thigh-bpne. It is not round, but flat or triangular. It has a broad triangular bafis, rooted in the focket exactly at that place where the feveral bones of the focket meet, form- ing a triangular ridge, which gives this triangular form to the central ligament. It has three angles, and three * This ligament is.double ; that is, there is one on the infide of the edge, and one on the outfide ; thence it is often reckoned as two ligaments, viz. ugamentvm transversals internum^ et tXTERNUM, flat

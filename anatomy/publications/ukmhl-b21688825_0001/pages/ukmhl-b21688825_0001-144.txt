I0O OF THE BONES bone. 4. There is another procefs, the bell entitled to the name of procefs, becaufe it Hands out quite infulat- ed, and goes outwards and backwards to unite with the temporal bone, in forming the zygoma or temporal arch ; it is named the zygomatic process. 5. That plate, which goes backwards to form the floor of the or- bit, is named the internal orbit ary process. This bone has no holes, except fuch minute ones as tranfmit arteries, merely for the nourilhment of the bone itfelf.

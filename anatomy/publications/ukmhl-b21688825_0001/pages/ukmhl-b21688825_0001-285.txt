MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 24I axilla before. The latiflimus dorfi has a wider range: when the arm is raifed, it brings it downwards, as in. ftriking with a hammer; or downwards and back- wards, as in ftriking with the elbow; or in rolling the arm inwards and backwards, as in turning the palm of the hand behind the back; whence it has the obfcene name of musculus scalptor ANi,ortersor ani ; and it forms the back edge of the axilla. The edges of thefe two mufcles receive the preffure of crutches, and defend the veffels and nerves: when both mufcles aÂ£t, the arm is prelfed directly down- wards, as in riling from our feat, or in holding a bundle under the arm; or when the arm is fixed, thefe mufcles raife the body, as in the example juft mentioned of rifmg from our feat, or in walking with a fhort ftick, or in railing ourfelves by our hands over a high beam. LXXI. The deltoides is the firft of thofe muf- cles which arife from the fcapula to be inferted into the Ihoulder-bone. It is named deltoid mufcle, from its refembling the letter A of the Greeks ; it is thick and flefhy, and covers the top of the lhoulder, filling up the fpace betwixt the acromion procefs and the lhoulder-bone. It arifes from all that part of the cla- vicle which is not occupied by the pe&oralis mufcle, and is feparated from it only by a fatty line: it arifes again in another bundle, from the point of the acro- mion procefs; and this middle bundle is alfo infulated by a fatty line on either lide of it: the third bundle arifes fromlhe fpine of the fcapula, behind the acro- mion procefs. And thus the mufcle has three converg- ing heads, viz. a head from the outer end of the cla- vol. 1. p. viclej

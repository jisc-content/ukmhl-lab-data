400 OF THE MUSCULAR POWER* proof ftronger in the grown animal, when we cut out the heart, which anfwers to ftimuli for fome time ; at lafl feems to have its power exhaufted ; it lies dead for fome time, till it again recovers its power. If this power proceeded from the nerves, how could it be renewed ? but if it refide in the mufcle only, it may have been wearied, and may revive; its organization may have been deranged, and may be reftored by reft from ftimuli; and its parts may be compofed again, refum- ing their relative fituation, and their aCKve arrangement and form ; or though it may be infenfible to a ftimu- lus long applied, it may be ftill alive, even to a lower ftimulus of another kind; or it may awake again to the feeling of that ftimulus, which, by being too long applied, had loft its power. Senfibility depends upon the nerves; motion on the mufcles: both are equally admirable and infcru- table; the one conducing to all the enjoyments, and all the fufferings of life, and to the intellectual faculties of man ; the other being the chief fupport of animal life, and the fource of all the bodily powers. As for the mechanical powers, by which the con- tractions of the mulcular fibre is forwarded or retard- ed, they are not what they have been believed; for we find few circumftances in the origin, infertion, or forms of mufcles, to favour their power, but many by which their power is abridged. There are certain points where the length of lever gives an increafe of power. The maftoid procefs, and the occiput, are as leVers for the head; the fpines of the vertebras, for the back; the olecranon, for the arm; and the pifi- form bone, for the hand.

Of THE TRUNK. 145 by violence, and fometimes by internal difeafe; but if it be affirmed, that “ the joinings of the pelvis are “ diffolved to facilitate labour/’ I would obferve, that wherever reparation of the bones has happened, it has both increafed the difficulties of the labour, and been in itfelf a very tenable difeafe ; for proofs of which, I mull refer to Hunter, Denman;, and others, to whofe peculiar province fuch cafes belong. But furely thefe principles will be univerfally acknowledged : That the pelvis fupporting the trunk is the centre of its larged motions : that if the bones of the pelvis were loofened, fuch motions could no longer be performed: that when, by violence or by internal difeafe, or in the time of fevere labour, thefe joinings have actually been diffolved' or burft, the woman has become in- ftantly lame, unable to fit, Hand, or lie, or fupport herfelf in any degree; fhe is rendered incapable of turning, or even of being turned in bed ; her attend- ants cannot even move her legs, without intolerable anguifh, as if torn afunder There fometimes follows a collection of matter within the joint (the matter ex- tending quite down to the tuber ifehii), high fever, delirium, and death f ; or in cafe of recovery (which is indeed more frequent), the recovery is flow and partial only ; a degree of lamenefs remains, with pain, weaknefs, and languid health; they can ftand on one leg more eafily than on both ; they can walk more eafily than they can ftand; but it is many months before they can walk without crutches ; and long after they come to walk upon even ground, * Denman. f Hunter. vol. i. l climb- I

SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND, 177 The VOL. 1. n Ibreaft, fo that by being folded merely without any turning of the os humeri, the hands are laid acrofs. 3. The articulating furface which Hands betwixt thefe condyles, forms a more ftriÂ£t and limited hinge than can be eafily conceived, before we explain the other parts of the joint. The joint confifts of two fur- faces ; firft, a fmooth furface, upon which the ulna moves only backwards and forwards; and, fecondly, of a fmall knob upon the inner tubercle, which has a neat round furface, upon which the face or focket be- longing to the button-like end of the radius rolls. Thefe two furfaces are called the fmall head, and the cartilaginous pulley of the humerus. 4. Belonging to the joint, and within its capfular ligament, there are two deep hollows, which receive certain proceffes of the bones of the fore arm. One deep hollow on the fore part of the humerus, and juft above its ardculating pulley, receives the horn-like or coronoid procefs of the ulna, the other receives the olecranon or that procefs of the ulna which forms the point of the elbow. RADIUS and ULNA. The radius and ulna are the two bones of the fore arm. The radius, named from its refemblance to the ray or fpoke of a wheel; the ulna, from its being often ufed as a meafure. The radius belongs more pe- culiarly to the wrift, being the bone which is chiefly connected with the hand, and which turns along with it in all its rotatory motions: the ulna, again, belongs more ftridtly to the elbow-joint; for by it we perform all the actions of bending or extending the arm.

188 BONES OF THE they are like flones in an arch, fo that no weight nor force can beat them in ; if any force do prevail, it can beat others in only by forcing one out. A bone flart» ing outwards, and projefling upon the back of the hand, is the only form of luxation among thefe bones, and is extremely rare, METACARPUS.—The metacarpus is compofed of five bones, upon which the fingers are founded. They are big ftrong bones; brought clofe together at the root, but wider above ; for the lower heads are fmall and fiat, and grouped very clofely together, to meet the carpal bones ; but they fvvell out at their upper ends into big round heads, which keep the bones much apart from each other. Nothing of importance can be faid concerning the individual bones. To fpeak of them individually is a mere wafte of time. We may ob- ferve of the metacarpal bones in general, i. That their lower heads being fiat and fquared, gives them a firm implantation upon their centre or nucleus, the carpus; and that they have fcarcely any freer motion upon the carpal bones, than the carpal bones have upon each other. 2. That their lower heads being larger, keeps the bones apart from each other; and in the interfti- ces between them lie the interoflTeous mufcles. 3. That their divergence regulates the radiated or fpreading form of the fingers, and gives them free play. And, 4. That they ftill preferve the arched form of the car- pal bones, being, with the carpal bones, convex out- wardly, and concave inwardly, to form the hollow of the hand; and though they have little motion of flexion or extenfion, they bend towards a centre, fo as to ap-

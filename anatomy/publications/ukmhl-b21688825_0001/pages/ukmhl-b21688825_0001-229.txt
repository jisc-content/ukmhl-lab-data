SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. 185 4. The being the Iargeft, but alfo as it forms a chief part of the joint of the wrift ; for it is this bone which is re- ceived into the fcaphoid cavity of the radius. It is a very irregular bone ; in which we need remember only thefe two points ; the large round furface covered with cartilage, fmooth, and anfwering to the cavity in the head of the radius; and the hook-like, or projedt- ing procefs, which forms one of the corner points of the carpus, and gives a hold to one corner of the liga- ment which binds down the tendons of the wrift. 2. The os lunare is named from one of its ftdes being fomewhat of the fhape of a half moon ; it is next in fize to the fcaphoid bone, and is equal to it in importance ; for they are joined together, to be articulated with the radius. This bone takes an equal lhare in the joint with the fcaphoid bone; and together they form a great ball, fitting the focket of the radius, and of a long form, fo that the wrift is a proper hinge. The lunated edge of the os lunare is turned towards the fecond row of bones, and therefore is not feen. And the chief marks of this bone are its greater fize; its lunated edge, turned towards the fe- cond row ; and its round head forming the ball of the wrift-joint. 3. The os cuNEiFORME,or wedge-like bone,is named rather perhaps from its fituation, locked in among the other bones, than ftriftly from its form. Its fide form- ing the convex of the hand, is broader; its point to- wards the palm of the hand is narrower ; and fo far, we may fay, it is a wedge-like bone : but it is chiefly fo from its fituation, clofely wedged in betwixt the un- ciform and pifiform bones,

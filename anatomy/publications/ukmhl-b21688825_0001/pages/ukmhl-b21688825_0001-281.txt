I MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 237 major may aflifl in heaving up the ribs: but its chief operation is upon the fcapula ; for when the whole acts, it pulls the fcapula downwards and forwards: when only the lower portions adt, it pulls the lower angle of the fcapula forwards, by which the fcapu- la rolls, and the tip of the Ihoulder is raifed : when the upper part adts in conjundtion with the little pedtoral mufcle, the tip of the Ihoulder is fixed and pulled downwards towards the chefl, and the lower corner of the fcapula rolls backwards. LXVII. The pectoralis minor lies under the pedtoralis major, clofe upon the ribs ; and as it arifes from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, it alfo is aferrated mufcle, and was named ferratus minor anticus : its three digitations are very thick and flefhy; they foon con- verge fo as to form a fmall, but thick and flefhy, muf- cle, which terminating in a point, is inferted into the very apex of the coracoid procefs : by pulling the coracoid procefs forwards and downwards, it will roll the fcapula. LXVIII. The subclavian muscle is another con. cealed mufcle of the fcapula; for the clavicle is juft the hinge upon which the fcapula moves, and the fubclavian mufcle arifes by a flat tendon from the cartilage of the firft rib : it becomes flat and flefhy, and lies along betwixt the clavicle and the firft rib ; it arifes at a fingle point of the rib, flat and tendinous ; but it is inferted into a great length of the clavicle, beginning about one inch from the flernum, and be- ing inferted all along the clavicle, quite out to where it is joined to the acromion procefs. Its chief ufe (fince the rib is immoveable) mull furely be to pull the cla- vicle.

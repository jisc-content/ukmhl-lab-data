396 OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. with the nerves: but it is perhaps fuch a derange-, ment as happens in a fpring, which, being long bent, lofes of its elaftic power : the arrangement of its par- ticles fuffers by {training ; they are compofed by reft : and if . the elaftic power be thus reftored in an inani- mate fpring, much more fhould the contractile power recover by reft in the mufcular fibres of a living fyftem. The vis insita cannot be wearied nor exhaufted ; fo the heart is unwearied in its function, or if languid or too violent in its actions, that muft be from the power of ftimulus being lowered or increafed, not from any change on the inherent power. The volun- tary mufcles alfo are unwearied; and fo, after great fatigue, we are fenfible of cramps and irregular con- tractions, {howing that they are ftill aCtive, but more loofely governed by the nerves, and not fo fully un- der the command of the will. But the nervous system is more fubjeCt to wearinefs and to decay: The fenfes become tired; the feelings of the fyftem are exhaufted. It is from this failing of the nervous, power that violent exertions bring fatigue and pain: from this alfo that we need the refreftiment of fleep ; but during fleep, the heart, and all the involuntary mufcles, unwearied in their functions, proceed ftill in the fame regular and orderly courfe. This irritability or inherent power not only keeps the mufcles ready, each for its peculiar ftimulus, but preferves a balance over the whole fyftem of the muf- cles, We know that mufcles maintain a conftant action independent of the nerves. The mufcles of one fide balance the oppofite mufcles : and if the mufcles of one fide be relaxed by palfy, the aCtion of the oppo- fite

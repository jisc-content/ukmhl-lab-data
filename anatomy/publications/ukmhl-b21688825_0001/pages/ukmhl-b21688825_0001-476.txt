JOINTS OF THE 432 too little noticed, and, fo far as I remember, hardly confidered or known. The general capsule arifes from the humerus, from both the tubercles, and all round the two hollows which receive the olecranon and coronoid procelfes of the ulna; it is implanted again into the tip of the olecranon, and all round that figmoid ca- vity which receives the lower end of the humerus, and all round the edge of the coronary procefs. It is alfo fixed round the neck of the radius; it comprehends, in one bag, the humerus, radius, and ulna; and unites them into one joint, performing two motions, viz. flexion and extenfion by the ulna,' and rolling by the radius. The joint is lubricated by mucus and by fat, which is found chiefly about the olecranon; and that the bones may be further fecured, additional ligaments are fpread out upon them, which are all without the common capfule of the joint lying upon it, and flrengthening it at the neceflary points. i. There is the common capfule inclofing the whole. 2. It is the form of every hinge-joint (and this is one of the purefl) to have its capfule flrengthened at the fides; and the Aides of this, the elbow-joint, are flrengthened by two fafciculi or ligamentous heads, which, coming from the tubercles of the humerus,fpread a little upon the capfule, and adhere to it like part of its fubflance. One, from the outer condyle, fpreads upon the neck of the radius, and is named the exter- nal lateral ligament : one from the innercondyle of the humerus, goes upon the infide of the capfule, and flrengthens it there: it is implanted near the root of the coronoid procefs of the ulna, and is named the internal lateral ligament. 3. The continual rol- ling motion of the radius requires a peculiar ligament; and

MUSCLES MOVING THE -THIGH-BONE. 35! could not pull the thigh backwards, for the thigh- bone would turn on its axis and elude their adion. The pfoas magnus, the iliacus internus, the pedina- lis, and the triceps, do in the fame manner go round the inner fide of the bone : the two firll to be im- planted into the trochanter minor, the two latter into the iinea afpera, juft below it. Thefe are juftly named addudors of the thigh: their chief ufe is to. draw the thighs together: And this is the combined effed of thefe two fets of mufcles. When the addudors ad by themfelves, they pull the thigh forwards, moving the leg, rolling the thigh-bone, and turning the toe out in a graceful flep; which is molt peculiarly the effed of the pedinalis and triceps. But when we are to finifh the motion, by pulling forward the body, which is the fame with pulling back the thigh, it is not merely the antagonifls of thefe mufcles, as the glutasi, the ge- mini, &c. which muft ad. Were the glutaci to ad alone, they would rather turn the thigh upon its axis outwards than pull it back; but the triceps, &c. ad again in conjundion with the glutsei, &c. and by the adion of the triceps, the inner trochanter is fixed j the further rolling of the thigh is prevented; the full effed is given to the glutgei mufcles. .When the glutsei ad, they pull the thigh diredly backwards, affifled by the triceps, pedinalis, and others : for now the thigh- bone is fo far advanced before the body, that thofe mufcles, as the triceps, which were benders of the thigh in its fir ft pofition, are extenfors when it is ad- vanced a flep before the body; or, perhaps, it will be more explicit to fay, that when the thigh is moved one flep before the bodv, the iliacus internus, pfoas magnus,

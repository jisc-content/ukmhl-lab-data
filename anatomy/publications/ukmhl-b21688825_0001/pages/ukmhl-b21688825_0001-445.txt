OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. 401 trochanters, are as levers for the thigh ; the patella is a lever for the leg ; the heel-bone is a lever for the whole foot; and the arch of the foot is as a lever for the toes. Thefe are not the whole, but they are perhaps the chief, levers in the human body. In all the other implantations the mufcle is fixed, not be- hind the joint, but betwixt the joint and the weight that is to be moved. There is a greater lofs of power when inferted near to the joint; there is lefs lofs of power when the tendon is inferted far from the joint; and though we call fuch infertion a longer or fhorter lever, there is always fome lofs of power, and the true levers in the body are very few. Far from providing mechanical forms to increafe the power, nature has provided fuch a quantity of contraftile power as to compenfate for any lofs of effect: So, in place of in- creafing the effect of mufcles by levers, pulleys, and hinges, there is in almoft every mufcle a great abate- ment of its force by the form of the bones which it is deflined to move; for mufcles lofe of their ef- fect by their being implanted, not behind the joint, but betwixt the joint and the body to be moved; by the infertion of almofl all mufcles being very ob- lique, with refpeft to the motions which they are to perform; fo that half their force is loft upon the immoveable end of the bone. Much force is loft by a mufcle paffing over many joints : one fet of fibres in a mufcle hinders the a&ion of adjoining fibres, and every degree of contraction takes from that mufcle an equal proportion of its power. Thus, every where in the human body, is power facrificed to the form and fitnefs Â©f the part; that the joints may be final- VOL, 1. d d ler

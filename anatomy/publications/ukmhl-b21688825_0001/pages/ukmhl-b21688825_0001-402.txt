It alfo bends the leg upon the knee; and when the leg does not yield, it bends the thigh upon the pubis ; or where the thigh alfo is fixed, it bends the body forwards : but in performing that ac- tion, whence it has its name, it does all thefe ; for firfl the leg and thigh are rolled, then the thigh is bended towards the belly, then the legs are bent to draw them acrofs. Though a fmall mufcle, yet it is of great power from its origin, and in fome degree from its infertion alfo $ being much removed from the centre of motion. CLXXVI. The gracilis, fometimes called rectus internus FEMORis #, is a fmall, flat, thin mufcle, in its general fhape fomewhat like the fartorius. It arifes by a flat tendon of two inches in length from the pubis and near the fymphyfis; and it pafles immediately under the integuments down to the knee : it pafles by the inner condyle of the knee, in the form of a fhort round tendon ; and as it bends behind the head of the tibia, it is bound down by a bundle of tendinous fibres, which eroding it, go to the back part of the leg. After pafling the head of the tibia, it turns obliquely forwards and downwards ; it here runs behind the tendon of the fartorius, and before that of the femitendinofus. It is inferted with the fartorius into the fide of the tuberofity at the top of the tibia, This mufcle runs alfo iq a line fo wide from the centre of motion, that its power is very great. It ferves chiefly as a flexor of the leg : When the leg is *1 ^ * Gracilis is from its fmallnefs ; rectus ikternus is from its ftraiAit duedtion. V fixed*

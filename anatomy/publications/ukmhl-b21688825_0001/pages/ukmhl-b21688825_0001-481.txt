SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. 437 and gaments to one or two of the bones of the carpus * ; and at their heads, where the fingers are implanted upon them, forming the knuckles, they are again tied by flat ligaments, which go from head to head of the metacarpal bones f, binding them together, permitting a flight bending towards each other, fo as to make a hollow in the hand, but no fuch wide motion as might aflifl the fingers; they are but as a foundation upon which the fingers ftand and move, FINGERS. The joints of the fingers are formed by round heads in the upper end of one row of bones, and by hollow fockets on the lower ends of the next row. Each joint is qualified by the round form of its head to be a cir- cular and free moving joint; but it is reftri&ed by the forms of its ligaments to the nature of a hinge-joint; for each finger-joint is included firft in a fair round capfule or bag, of the ordinary form; but that capfule is ftrengthened by very diftindf lateral ligaments upon its fides, which lateral ligaments form the chief flrength of the joints; above thefe lateral ligaments the joint is ftrengthened by a broad fafcia or fheath, which comes from the tendons of the interoflei mufcles, co- vers the backs of all the fingers, and which is efpecially ftrong over the joints. One part of the apparatus of the wrift-joint is the fmooth and lubricated sheath, in which the tendons of the fingers run. It is formed in part by the outer fide of the capfule of the wrift, * And thefe alfo are named, according to their feveral directions, J.IGAMENTA ARTICULARIA, LATERALIA, RECTA, PERPENDICU- (S.ARIA, &C, f Thefe are named the eigamenta interossfa.

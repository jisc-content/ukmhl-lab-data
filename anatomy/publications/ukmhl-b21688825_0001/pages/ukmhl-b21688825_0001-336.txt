292 OF THE HEAD AND NECK. This is the splenius capitis ; but there is a por- tion of this fame mufcle which lies under this, and which has the fame common origin, but which ter- minates by four or five didind tendons in the tranf- verfe procefies of the upper vertebra of the neck. This portion may be dififeded apart; and has been con- fidered by many as a mufcle, the splenius colli of Albinus ; who has diftinguifhed as' fplenius capitis all that part arifing from the fpines of the neck, and im- planted into the head, and as the fplenius colli, all that part which arifes from the vertebras of the back, and is implanted into the tranfverfe procefies of the. neck. Thefe fplenii are the proper antagonifts of the maf- toid mufcles. Both the fplenii ading, pull the head diredly backwards; one ading turns the head and neck obliquely to one fide ; one ading along with the correfponding mafloid mufcle, lays the ear down upon the fhoulder. CXIX. The complexus is named from the intri- cacy of its mufcular and tendinous parts, which are mixed ; from the irregularity of its origins, which are very wide, it has the names of complexus-implica- tus-trigeminus, by which the fiudent is warned of the difficulty of underflanding this mufcle. It lies immediately under the fplenius ; arifes by dif- tind tendons, with ten or more tendinous feet, from the tranfverfe proceffes of the neck and back, from the four lower vertebrae of the neck, and from the feven upper- moll: of the back ; having alfo fome lefs regular origins, as from two fpines of the back, and from four oblique procefies in the neck. It grows into a large mufcle, which is not like the fplenius, flat and regular, but thick, flefhy.

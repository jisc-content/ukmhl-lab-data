392 OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. teflines by their contents: the urine flimulates the bladder; the venereal appetite flimulates the genital fyflem ; the foetus flimulates the womb ; and the vo- luntary mufcles (if we may be allowed to guefs at a thing fo little known) are excited by the nerves, and fo are obedient to the will; for, to our limited view, the nerves feem to be the foie meffengers of thefe commands; and any flimulus to the nerves moves the mufcles like the commands of the will. The abfence of the due flimulus to each, or the prefence of ordinary flimuli in too great power, will excite enormous and irregular motions ; as fulnefs of blood in the heart, poi- fons in the flomach, acrimonies in the inteflinal canal, or the paffions of anger or fear in the fyflem of the vo- luntary mufcles. The due flimuli preferve their right tone and aftion ; but thefe violent flimuli hurt their ir- ritability or moving power ; the heart afts weakly af- ter fevers ; the appetite is languid after debauch ; the limbs are weakened by labour; and the whole fyflem Is ruined by excefs. Thus the functions by which the fyflem lives, the heart, the flomach, the bowels, and the womb, the various forts of .veffels by which the fluids are conveyed, are providently removed from the influence of the will; for thefe are the machines of the fyflem, whofe motions could not flop, mufl not be in- terrupted, nor lowered, nor raifed, but muff move and aft according to the needs of the fyflem. Not left to. the irregularities or careleffnefs of voluntary motions, they are governed each by its own peculiar flimulus, and aft in a continued and equal courfe. Thus there are in the body two living powers which are as caufe and effect in all the motions of our fyflem. The

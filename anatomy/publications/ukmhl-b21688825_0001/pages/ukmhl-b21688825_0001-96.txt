CHAP. III. DESCRIPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. Os FRONTIS. This bone is compared with a clam- fhell. It is of a femicircular fhape, hollowed like a fliell, and very equal in its thicknefs. It is marked on the infide by a fpine, or prominent line, which di- vides the hollow of the bone into two equal parts, and gives rife to a membraneous partition, which di- vides and fupports the hemifpheres of the brain. It is marked on its external furface by thofe high ridges on which the eyebrows are placed; and by two pro- minences, under which are hollow caverns, named the sinuses (or cavities) of the frontal bone. It is irregular only in its orbitary plates, which are the two thin and delicate lamella that depart from the gene- ral direction of the bone, and hand out horizontally fo as to form a part of the focket for the eye, or, as it were, a roof defending the upper part of the eye and a floor for fupporting the lower part of the brain ; and thefe two orbitary plates leave an open fpace, in which is incafed the chief part of the sethmoid bone.

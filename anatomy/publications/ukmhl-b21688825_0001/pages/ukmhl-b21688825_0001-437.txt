OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. 393 The nerves (land as an intermedium betwixt all ex- ternal objects and our general fenfe ; by the impref- ftons through thefe come pleafure and pain, and all the motives to action; by the will, returned through the nerves, all voluntary motions enfue. Thus are the nerves, as internuncii, betwixt the external im» preffion and the moving power. But nerves were ne- ver known to move under the influence of flimuli; the moving power is another property of a diflinct part of our body, having its own arrangement of particles, and its own peculiar form. All motion then proceeds from the joint operation of either power j the nerves convey the impreffions, while the mufcles contain the power ; and it is here, as in other natural effects, the external caufe. changes, while the inherent property, the fub- je£t of its operation, remains the fame. The nervous power is the regulator of the fyflem; it is the property fuited to all the fupports of life, upon which they aft, and by which they maintain their power over our body: but it is fubjedt to continual changing; it rifes and falls, is perfect or low; but the energy of the mufcle, which is to anfwer to this power, remains ever the fame while its organization remains ; the nervous power is exhaufted and languid; but the mufcular power is al- ways perfect, always ready for the excitement of fli- muli or for the commands of the will. There is (if we may be allowed any expreffion fo loofe and indefinite) the will of the fyflem, and the will of the mind : it is the will of the fyflem that, through the medium of nerves of wide fympathy and confent, governs and leads in harmony all the confent- ing functions of the body, and lowers and raifes their powers,

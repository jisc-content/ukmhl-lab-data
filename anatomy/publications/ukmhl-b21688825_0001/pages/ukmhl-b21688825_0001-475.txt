It fhould alfo be remembered, that the long tendinous head of the biceps mufcle comes from the margin of the focket, directly over the ball of the os humeri, and through the capfule, by a par- ticular hole. ELBOW. The elbow-joint is formed by three bones; the humerus, radius, and ulna: the ulna bends backwards and forwards upon the fhoulder-bone; the radius bends upon the fhoulder-bone along with the ulna; it al- ways muff accompany the ulna, but it alfo has a mo- tion of its own, rolling in circles; its round button-like head rolling continually with its edge upon a focket in the ulna, and with its flat face upon the tubercle of the humerus. The whole compofes one joint, and is inclofed in one capfule : the bones accompany each other in their luxations, as well as in their natural motions: the ulna is never diflocated without the ra- dius being alfo difplaced ; a cirCurnflance which is but * Vide Monroâ€™s Tables of the Burfse Mucofas, where all thefe parts are reprefented ; the knowledge of which is fo very ufefulfor the furgeon. I have opened this great barfa u. der the acromion procefs, and let out four pounds of the peculiar mucus and gelati- nous lumps with which the difeafed burfe are commonly filled. too

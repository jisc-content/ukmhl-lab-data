BONES OF TH^ joined, and its elafticity from the fmall movements of thefe bones with each other; for each bone and each joint has its cartilage, its capfule or bag, its lubricating fluid, and all the apparatus of a regular joint; each moves, flnce the cartilages are always lubricated, and tire bones are never joined by anchylofis with each other; but the effect is rather a diffufed elafticity, than a marked and perceptible motion in any one joint. The feven bones of which the tarfus is compofed are, i. The astragalus, which, united with the tibia and fibula, forms the ankle joint: 3, The os calcis, or heel bone, which forms the end or back point of that arch upon which the body ftands: 3. The os naviculare, or boat-like bone, which joins three fmaller bones of the fore part of the tarfus to the aft tralagus : 4. The os cuboides, which joins the fmaller bones of the fore part to the os calcis: The 5th, 6th* and 7th, are the fmaller bones making the forepart of the tarfus ; they lie immediately under the place of the (hoe-buckle, and are named the three cuneiform bones, from their wedge-like fliape; and it is upon thefe that the metatarfal bones, forming the next dft vifion of the foot are implanted. Thefe bones of the tarfus form, along with the next rank or metatarfal bones, a double arch ; firft from the loweft point of the heel to the ball of the great toe, is one arch ; the arch of the foie of the foot which fupÂ« ports the body: and again* there is another arch with- in this, formed among the tarfal bones themfelves, one within another, i. e. betwixt the aftralagus, calcis, and naviculare; through which hole, in my drawing, there 14 is

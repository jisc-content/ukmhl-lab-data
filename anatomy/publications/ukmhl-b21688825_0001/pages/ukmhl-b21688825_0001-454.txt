4io OF THE TENDONS, goes onwards to the next bone. Thus the periofteum of all the bones is one continued membrane, paffing from point to point: each bone is tied to the next by its own periofteum ; and this membrane betwixt the end of one bone and the beginning of the next, is fo thickened into a ftrong and hard bag, as to form the capfule of the joint; and the periofteum is affifted in performing this office by the tendons, fafciee, burfae, and all that confufion of cellular fubftance which furrounds the joint. The capsule of the joint is then a firm and thick bag, which, like a ligament, binds the bones together, keeps their heads and proceffes in their right places, contains that glairy liquor with which the heads of moving bones are bedewed, and prevents the adjacent parts from falling inwards, or being catched betwixt the bones in the bendings of the joints. The capfule of every joint proceeds from the peri- ofteum, and is ftrengthened by the tendons ; it is form- ed like thefe parts, out of the cellular membrane; and when a bone is broken, or its periofteum deftroyed by any accident or difeafe, when a tendon fnaps acrofs, when a joint is luxated, and the capfule torn, the injury is foon repaired by a thickening of the cellular fubftance round the breach ; and wherever a bone, being luxated, is left unreduced, a new focket, new periofteum, new ligaments, and new burfae, are formed out of the common cellular fubftance; and though the tendons may have been torn away from the head of the bone, they are fixed again, taking a new hold upon the bone. 8. There are other ligaments of a joint which prevent its luxation, guarding it at its Tides, or round

376 MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES. \ ^ Thefe do not only, like other extenfors, extend the toes, but alfo, by the divergence of the tendon, expand them or feparate them one from another. CXCIV. The peron^eus tertius fhould have been defcribed as a flexor of the foot, along with the tibia- alis anticus; but is fo naturally connected with this, that it will be more eaflly underltood now. It is often named peron^eus tertius., fometimes nonus versa- lii, or ninth mufcle of the foot. Its origin is from the fibula, chiefly from the middle downwards ; alfo from the interofleous membrane ; and {till from the tendinous partition which divides it from the peronaeus brevis. Its origin is almoft entirely flefhy; and it lies behind and under the extenfor communis, fo that it feems in its belly to be a part of that mufcle. Its tendon alfo pafles along with the tendon of the extenfor communis, through the fame ring of the an- nular ligament; and there going obliquely towards the outfide or edge of the foot oyer the fhorter extenfor, it expands and covers the metatarfal bone of the littlp toe with an expanfion, and adheres to it as a flexor of the foot; and this, as well as the tibialis and other peronafi, have an oblique infertion generally into the fide of the foot; or if into the foie, it is after rum ning over the fide, as over a pulley $ fo that all of them tend to prefs down one edge, that of the ball pf the great toe, to the ground* CXCV. TheSNTENSOR DIGITCRUM BRpVIS is foC0I1- nedled with the extenfor longus, that it is natural to defcribe them together. The extenfor brevis is a fmall mafs of flefh, fome\vhat refembling the mafia carnea and lumbricales of the foot. It is placed juft where the I !

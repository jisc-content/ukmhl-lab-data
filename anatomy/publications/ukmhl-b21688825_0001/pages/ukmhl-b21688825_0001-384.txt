j40 MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE* mination. It is thick and flefhy in the middle, fwelling out. It extends downwards, and obliquely back* ■Wards, almoft to the middle of the thigh; and there it terminates obliquely, betwixt the two lamellae of the membrane to which it belongs. Its ufe is chiefly to make the fafcia tenfe, to prepare the mufcles for ftrong action 5 and perhaps, by its ad- hefions about the trochanter, it may have fome little effect in rolling the thigh, fo as to turn the toes in- wards, and oppofe the Gemini. CLVII. Psoas magnus.—This and the following mufcle come from within the body to move the thigh forwards. This is a very long and flelhy mufcle; of confiderable flrength ; of conflant ufe; perpetually employed in moving the thigh forwards, or in fupport- ing the pelvis upon the thigh-bone, fo as to preferve the equilibrium of the body. It is named from psoa lumbus ; is a large round mufcle, very ftrong, of great length, filling up all the fpace upon either fide of the fpine, and bounding the pelvis at its fide. It comes from under the ligamentum arcuatum of the diaphragm; for it arifes firfl by its up* permoft head from the lafl vertebra of the back, then fucceffively from each of the vertebrae of the loins. It flicks clofe to the lumber vertebras; for it arifes, not only from the tranfverfe proceffes, but from the fides of the bodies. Thefe heads do not appear; for they are covered by the body of the mufcle, which goes down thick and round till it reaches the facro-iliac fymphi- fis, and then, being united to the internal iliac mufcle, they defcend through Paupart’s ligament.

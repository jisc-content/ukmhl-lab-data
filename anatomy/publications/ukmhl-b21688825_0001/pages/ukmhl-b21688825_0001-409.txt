It arifes from the external condyle of the femur wholly flefhy; it alfo has an at- tachment to the capfular ligament of the joint; after an oblique flefhy belly of about three inches, it forms its fmall flat tendon. The tendon runs betwixt the inner head of the gaftrocnemius and the foleus ; and where the tendo Achillis begins, the tendon of the plantaris attaches itfelf to the inner edge and fore part of the Achillis tendon ; it accompanies it down to the heel, running in a groove which feems made to receive it: and is implanted with the tendo Achillis into the inner fide of the heel bone. It is often awant- ing. The ufe of this mufcle is to tuck up the capfule in the great bendings of the knee-joint, and to affifl the gaftrocnemii mufcles. The PERONiEi mufcles are thofe which arife from the fibula. They are named from their length being different; the peron^eus longus being as long again as the brevis ; for it is one half longer in its origin, the one rifmg at the head, the other at the middle of the bone ; and again it is one half longer at its infertion, going fully round under the foot of the oppofite fide, \yhile the fhorter peronseus flops at the fide of the foot to be inferted. CLXXXIV. The peronseus longus is fo named from its lying along the fibula. It arifes partly ten- dinous, chiefly flefhy, from the upper knob of the fi- bula, and from the ridge of the bone, down to within three

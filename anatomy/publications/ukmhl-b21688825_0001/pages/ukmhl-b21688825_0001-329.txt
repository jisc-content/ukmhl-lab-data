Thefe mufcles are related either to the arm, to the ribs, or to the fpine, i. e. the verte- brae, whofe motions they perform; and from this we obtain an arrangement not inconfiftent with the regu- lar order of their office, and yet correfponding with the belt order of diffe&ion.

The ferrated muf- cles, which lie next under thefe, are the mufcles of refpiration, and belong to the ribs : while the fplenius and complexus, the mufcles of the neck, the iongiffi- m,us dorfi, facro lumbalis,and the quadratus lumborum, which

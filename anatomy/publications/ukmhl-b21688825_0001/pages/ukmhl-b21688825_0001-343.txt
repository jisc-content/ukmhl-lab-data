MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. 299 ferted ; one fet of feet more flefhy, but fmall and neat, go outwards from the fide as it were of the mufcle, to be implanted near the heads of the ribs ; the lower ones farther out than the heads of the ribs ; the upper ones clofe to the head, and confequently clofer to the fpine. Thefe heads are nine or ten in number, cor- refponding with the nine or ten uppermofl ribs. An- other fet of heads, which are not fo well feen as this fet, becaufe they lie more under the mufcle, are fmall, neat, and tendinous; they go in an oppofite direftion, viz. inwards and upwards; keep clofer by the fpine and are inferted into the tranfverfe precedes of the ver- tebrae of the back. This fet of heads is thirteen in number, implanted into the tranfverfe proceffes of all the back, and of one vertebra of the neck. CXXVII. The sacro lumbalis feparates from the Iongiffimus dorfi at the laft rib, and is a flatter and lefs flefhy mufcle : its twelve tendons are flatter than thofe of the Iongiffimus dorfi, and go out wider from the fpine. The tendons next to the Iongiffimus dorfi run highefl up, and are the longeft ; thofe farthefl: from the fpine, i. e. farthefl out upon the cheft, are the fhortefl. It has a flat tendon for each rib, which takes hold upon the lower edge of the rib. But it has an- other order of fmall mufcles which mix with it: for as the Iongiffimus dorfi has a double row of infertion, this has another fet of attachments ; for there arifes from the furface of each rib, at leafl of the fix or feven lowed: ribs, a fmall flip of flefh, which runs into the fubflance of the facro lumbalis, and mixes with it; and thefe flefhy flips go by the name of the additamen- TUM AD SACRO-LUMBALEM, Or MUSCULI ACCES50RII.

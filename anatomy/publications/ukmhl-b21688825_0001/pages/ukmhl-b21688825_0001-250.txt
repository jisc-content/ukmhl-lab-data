20 S MUSCLES OF THE focket. But there are other two mufcles which are named the oblique mufcles, becaufe they pull from the edges of the focket, and turn the eye obliquely; for they go in a direction exa£Uy oppofite to the re£ti. The re£ti come diredtly forwards from the bottom of the orbit; thefe go obliquely backwards from the edge of the orbit; one rifesfrom the lower edge of the focket, and goes backwards under eyeball; the other rifes indeed, along with the redti, in the bottom of the focket, but it has a cartilaginous pulley on the very edge of the focket, at its upper part; and its fmall round tendon firft runs through this pulley, and then turns down upon the eye, and goes backwards; fo that the flraight mufcles prefs down the eyeball deep into the focket, while the oblique mufcles bring the eyeball forwards, pulling it outwards from the focket. The trueft defcription of the redti is as of one muf- cle, fmce their only variety is that difference of place, which is expreffed by the name of each. They all agree in thefe chief circumftances, that they arife by flat, but fmall tendons, round the margin of the optic hole, ariflng from the circle of that hole, or rather from the periofteum there; and there being one above, one below, and one on either fide, they completely furround the optic n'erve, and adhere to it. They are neat and delicate mufcles, gradually expanding each into a flefliy belly, which furrounds and covers the middle of the ball of the eye. They ftill go on expanding, till they at lafb terminate, each in a broad, flat, and very white tendon, which covers all the fore part of the eye, up to the circle of the lucid cornea or window; and their white and ftiining ten- 8 dons

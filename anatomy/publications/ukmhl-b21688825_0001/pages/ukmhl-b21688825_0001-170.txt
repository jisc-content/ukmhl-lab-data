The cartilages of the fourth, fifth, and fixth ribs rife upwards, in proportion to their diftance from this central one. The firJft five ribs have independent cartilages; the eight, ninth, and tenth ribs run their cartilages into the cartilage of the feventh rib; and the eleventh and twelfth ribs have their cartilages finall, unconnected, and floating loofe. The sternum.â€”The fternum is that long and fquared bone, which lies on the fore part of the bread over the heart, and which being joined by the carti- lages of the ribs, completes the cavity of the cheft; it is for completing the thorax, and defending the heart; for a medium of attachment to the ribs ; and for a ful- crum or point, on which the clavicles may roll. We find the fternum confiding in the child of eight diftinft pieces ; which run together in the progrefs of life; and which in old age are firmly united into one : but in all the middle ftage of life, we find three pieces in the fternum, two of which are properly bone, the third remains a cartilage, till very late in life, and is named the enfiform cartilage, from its fword-like point. It is found to have eight pieces, even in the child of fix years old; forne years after, it has but five or fix ; at iaft but two only ; and the falient white lines, which traverfe the bone, mark where the intermedi- ate cartilages have once been. i. The upper piece of the fternum is very large, roundifh, or rather triangular, refembling the form of the heart on playing cards. It is about two inches in length, and an inch and a half in breadth ; and thefe - marks

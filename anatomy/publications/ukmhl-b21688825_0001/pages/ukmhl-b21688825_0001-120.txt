75 DESCRIPTION OF THE detaining the effluvise of odorous bodies, and alfo by reverberating the voice. Thus, in a common cold, while the voice is hurt by an affedtion of thefe cells, the fenfe of fuelling is almoft loft. 4. The orbitary plate of the aethmoid bone is a large furface; confifting of a very firm plate of bone, of a regular fquare form ; exceedingly fmooth and po- Mfhed : it forms a great part of the focket for the eye, lying on its inner fide. When we fee it in the detach- ed bone, we know it to be juft the flat fide of the ssth- moid bone; but while it is incafed in the focket of the eye, we fhould believe it to be a fmall fquare bone; and from this, and from its fmoothnefs, it has got the diftindt name of os planum. 5. The os unguis fhould alfo, perhaps, be counted as a part of this bone; for though the os unguis, when obferved in the orbit, feems to be a fmall detached bone, thin like a fcale, and of the fize of the finger nail (whence it has its name), yet in the adult, the os unguis is firmly attached to the sethmoid bone; comes along with it when we feparate the pieces of the fkulT; and when the os unguis is pared off from the sethmoid bone, the cells are ejcpofed. This os unguis, then, is a fmall fcaly-like plate, in the inner corner of the orbit juft over the nofe. We find in it that groove which holds the lachrymal fac, and conducts it to the nofe, and it is this thin bone that we perforate in making the new paffage into the nofe, when there is an obftruction in the natural dudt. 6. The cells of the sethmoid bone, which form fo important a fhare of the organ of fmell, are arranged in great numbers, al6ng the fpongy bone. They are fmall

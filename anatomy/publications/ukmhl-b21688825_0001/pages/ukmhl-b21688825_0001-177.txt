*33 OF THE TRUNK. Th© K 3 euous place of the pelvis, and its chief office is to fup- port the trunk ; to which we may add, that it defends the cauda equina ; tranfmits its great nerves; forms chiefly the cavity of the pelvis; and that it is along the hollow of this bone that the accoucher calculates the progrefs of the child’s head in labour. The os coccygis, fo named from its refemblance to the beak of cuckow, is a fmall appendage to the point of the facrum ; terminating this inverted column with an acute point, and found in very different con” ditions in the feveral ftages of life. In the child it is merely cartilage, and we can find no point of bone ; during youth it is offifying into diftindt bones, which continue moveable upon each other till manhood ; then the feparate bones gradually unite with each other, fo as to form one conical bone, with bulgings and marks of the pieces of which it was originally compo- fed ; but flill the laft bone continues to move upon the joint of the facrum, till in advanced years it is at laft firmly united ; later in women than in men, with whom it is often fixed at twenty or twenty-five. It is not like the os facrum, flat, but of a roundifh form, con- vex without and concave inwards ; forming with the facrum the lowed: part of the pelvis behind. It has no holes like the facrum ; has no communication with the fpinal canal; and tranfmits no nerves ; but points for- wards to fupport the lower parts of the redtum : thus, it contradts the lower opening of the pelvis, fo as to fupport effedtually the redium, bladder, and womb, and yet continues fo moveable in women, as to recede in time of labour, allowing the head to pafs.

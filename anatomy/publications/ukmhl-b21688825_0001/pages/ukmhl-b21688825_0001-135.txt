OF THE FACE AND JAWS. 9l it has a flat fide towards the nofeâ€¢, it is divided from, the cavity of the noflril by a flat and very thin plate of bone; it feems in the naked fkull to have a very wide opening, and the lower fpongy bone is hung by a fmall hook upon the edge of this thin feptum, which divides the antrum from the nofe; but in the fkull, covered with its foft parts, we find the antrum almofl clofed by a membrane which ftretches over the opening, and leaves but one or two very fmall holes of the fize of the fmallefl pea, by which, perhaps, the reverberation of found in the antrum is more effectual in raifing the voice, and by which final! hole, the mucus, which is fecreted in the antrum, drops out into the nofe. The cavity of the antrum, like the inner furfaces of the nofirils, is covered with a membrane, and is bedewed with mucus; and the mucus drops more or lefs freely in various pofitions of the head. Sometimes by cold or other accidents, in* flammations and fwellings of the membrane come on ; the holes are clofed ; the drain of matter is fup- prefled and confined within, and the cheek fwells. Perhaps there may be feme particular difeafe of the membrane with which the cavity is lined, or of the bone itfelf; in one way or other, difeafes of this ca- vity, and collections of matter, dreadful pain and caries of the bone are very frequent; then the cheek rifes; the face is irrecoverably deformed ; fometimes the matter makes its way by the fides of the teeth, or at laft, it burfts through the bones, makes an ulcer in the cheek; and then there is a natural cure, but flow and uncertain. There is no very fure mark of this difeafe j it may be known by an attentive retro-

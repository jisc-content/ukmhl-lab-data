272 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. The annular ligament. Thefe tendons are tied together by a loofe web of fibres; and being gathered together, they pafs under the ligament in one common and ap- propriated channel. Having pafled this ligament, they diverge and grow flat and large; and they all have the appearance of being fplit by a perpendicular line. They are quite different from the flexor tendons in this, that they are all tied to each other by crofs bands; for a little above the knuckles, or firfl: joint of the fin- gers, all the tendons are joined on the back of the hand by flips from the little-finger to the ring, from the ring to the mid-finger, and from that to the fore-finger. So that it feems to be one ligament running quite acrofs the back of the hand. Tt would be foolifh to defcribe them more minutely; for the crofs bands change their places, and vary in every fubjed, and in fome they are not found. After this the tendons pafs over the heads of the metacarpal bones, along the firfl phalanx of the fin- gers } and being there joined by the tendons of the interoflei and lumbricales, they altogether form a flrong tendinous fheath, which furrounds the back of the fingers. Now, it is to be remembered, that this mufcle ferves only for the fore, middle, and ring fingers: That if it moves the little finger, it is only by a fmall flip of ten- dinous fibres, which it often gives off at the general divergence, but fometimes not; fometimes it gives one flip, fometimes two, often none at all. And fo the little-finger has its proper extenfor quite diflind from this.

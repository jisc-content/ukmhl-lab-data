JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE. 427 face of the dernum and that of the cartilages is co- vered with this tendinous expanfion, which belongs confufedly to the origins of the pefloral mufcles, to the ligaments of the ribs and dernum, and to the pe- riodeum of that bone. CHAP. II. JOINTS QF THE SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. CLAVICLE. The joining of the clavicle with the dernum is the hinge upon which the whole arm moves, and is the only point by which the arm is connetded with the trunk : the round button-like head of the clavicle rolls upon the articulating furface of the upper bone of the der- num : it is in fuch continual motion that fome parti- cular provifion is required; and accordingly it has, like the condyle of the jaw, a fmall moving cartilage, which rolls betwixt this head and the dernum. The cartilage is thin, and of a mucous nature ; it is move- able in fome degree, yet it is fixed by one edge to the head of the clavicle. This joint is inclofed in a drong capfule ; confiding fil'd of a bag, and then of an outer order of fibres, which go cut in a radiated form, upon the furface of the dernum, like the ligaments of the ribs; and they crofs and cover the dernum, fo that the

276 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. C. Extensor tertius pollicis.—This which bends the third joint is called in common the exten- for longus pollicis. And here is a third mufcle, which, in form, and place, and fun&ion, correfponds with the two former ones. Its origin is from the ridge of the ulna, and from the upper face of the interoffeous membrane : and it is a longer mufcle than the others ; for it begins high, near the top of the ulna, and continues the whole way down that bone, and is very fleflry and thick. It is penniform all the way down to the ligament of the wrift; and its fmall tendon paifes the ligament in a peculiar ring. This tendon appears fplit, like thofe of the fingers ; it goes along the ulnar fide of the firft bone of the thumb, reaches the fecond, and is im- planted there by a fmall flip of tendon y and being ex- panded, it ftill goes forward, to be inlerted once more into the third bone of the thumb at its root. Its, ufe is evident after defcribing the others; for we have only to add another joint for motion. It moves the laft joint of the thumb, then the fecond, then its metacarpal bone upon the carpus; and if that be held firm, it will extend the carpus; and it will, in its turn, contribute to fupination, though in a lefs degree than the others. CI.Indicator.—The extensor indicisproprius has very nearly the fame origin, and exadtly the fame courfe with the laft, and lies by the fide of it. Its origin is from the ulna, by the fide of the exten- for longus pollicis. It has alfo fome little attachments to the interoffeous membrane. It, like the others, is feathered

368 MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG, metatarfal bone firmly. The tendon of the longer mufcle alfo expands a little, and fomewhat in the form of a hand and fingers, taking hold of two bones by three little heads. This mufcle aflifls the former in extending the foot and coincides well in its oblique action with the laft; for as the laft turned down the inner edge of the foot, this turns the outer edge upwards, which is exa&ly the fame motion. CLXXXVI. The tibialis posticus is a penni- form mufcle, very much like the two laft defcribed, only its tendon goes round the cartilaginous pulley of the inner ankle. It is named tibialis from its origin, and posticus from its place. It arifes from the back part and ridge of the tibia, from the oppofite part of the fibula, and from the in* teroffoeus membrane below thefe ; and it continues its attachment to the interofleous ligament' quite down to the ankle. It has alfo ftrong attachments to the fur* rounding tendinous partitions. Its fibres are all ob- lique, and go to the middle tendon, which is in the heart of the mufcle. About the middle of the tibia this tendon begins to emerge from the flefhy belly; it grows gradually fmaller, but ftill continues to. re- ceive flefh quite down to the ankle. It paffes in the groove of the inner ankle, and is retained there by fuch a ligament as holds the peronaei. After palling the li- gament, it expands in the hand-like form, to grafp the bones of the tarfus: and it is expanded much more than the peronaeus; for it fends roots down among the bones both of the tarfus and metatarfus, fo as to take hold

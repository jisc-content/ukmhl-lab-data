MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 247 and Iatiflimus dorfi. It is alfo like all the other ten- dons, attached to the capfule, fo as to prevent its being catched; and it is particularly ufeful by ftrengthening the Ihoulder-joint. OF THE MOTIONS OF THE HUMERUS. Having thus defcribed all the mufcles which move this bone, I lhall review the order in which they are arranged, and mark their places and effe&s. To diftinguifh clearly the function of each mufcle, we have but to mark the point to which it is attached. 1. Thofe implanted above the head of the bone mull raife the arm. Now the fupra fpinatus, infra fpi- natus, and teres minor, are implanted into the great tubercle, and raife the arm; and the deltoides is im- planted in the fame diredlion, and Hill lower, fo that it performs the fame action with a Hill greater degree of power. 2. There is implanted into the oppolite, or lower part of the head, the fubfcapularis, which, of courfe, draws the arm directly downwards and backwards. 3. There is implanted into the outer edge of the bicipital groove the pedtoralis major, and alfo the co- raco-brachialis, which comes in the fame direction; and thefe two pull the arm inwards towards the fide, or rather upwards. 4. There are inferted into the infide, or lower fide of the groove, the Iatiflimus dorfi and teres major; both of which pull the arm directly backwards. As they bend under the arm, to reach their infertion, they alfo roll the palm inwards and backwards. And it is eafy to obferve in what fuccefiion thofe mufcles R 4. muft

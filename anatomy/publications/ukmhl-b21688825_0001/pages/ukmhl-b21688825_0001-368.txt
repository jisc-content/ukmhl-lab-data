324 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN, num, its lower and back part arifes near the pelvis from the lowed vertebrae of the loins. It is a circular mufcle, which is flefhy towards its borders, and tendinous in the centre ; which is convex towards the thorax, and concave towards the abdo- men ; becoming plain, or almoft fo, when it preffes againft the abdominal mufcles in drawing the breath ; and returning to its convex form when the abdominal mufcles re-aÂ£t in pufhing it back into the thorax. The diaphragm arifes, by one broad flefhy attach- ment, from all the borders of the cheft, forming the upper or greater mufcle of the diaphragm; and it arifes below, by many fmall tendinous feet, from the fore part of the loins, which, meeting, form what is called the lefler mufcle of the diaphragm, tft, The great or upper mufcle arifes, firft, from under the xiphoid cartilage, and from the lower furface of the fternum. 2dly, From all the falfe ribs; from the car- tilage of the feventh, eighth, and ninth ribs; and from the bony parts of the tenth and eleventh ribs ; and from the tip of the Kvelfth rib. All tbefe origins are, of courfe, flefhy digitations or tongues, which inter- mix with thofe of the tranfverfe mufcle of the abdo- men. 3dly, From the tip of the twelfth rib to the lumber vertebrae there is a ligament extended, which, going like an arch over the pfoas and quadratus lum- borum mufcles, is named ligamentum arcuatum; and from this another part ftill of the great mufcle of the diaphragm arifes. Thus the upper mufcle of the diaphragm has four chief origins, viz. from under the fternum and xiphoid cartilage; from all the falfe ribs; from

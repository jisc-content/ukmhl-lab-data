OR, OF THE RIBS. 287 f which He betwixt the 4.The intercostal Mus-J ribs, and fill up all the cles, j fpace betwixt rib and rib; b they alfo raife the ribs. And there may be added to thefe, that mufcle which, lying under the fternum and within the tho- rax, is called triangularis fterni, and pulls the ribs downwards. CXIII. The serratus superior posticus lies flat upon the fide of the neck, under the trapezius and â€¢rhomboides, and over the fplenius and complexus mufcles. It arifes by a flat and Aiming tendon from the fpines of the three lower vertebras of the neck and the two uppermoft of the back. It goes obliquely downwards under the upper corner of the fcapula, and is inferted into the fecond, third, and fourth ribs, by three neat flefliy tongues. The ligamentum nuchae is chiefly formed by the meeting of the trapezii mufcles; and the flat tendons pf thefe upper ferrated mufcles help to form it. They are purely levators of the ribs: their effect upon the vertebra, if they have any, muft be very flight. CXIV. The serratus inferior posticus is a very broad, thin, mufcle, fituated at the lower part of the back, under the latiflimus dorfi, but above the longif- fimus dorfi mufcle. It arifes in common with the latiflimus dorfi, from the fpines of the two or three lower vertebras of the back, and the three or four uppermoft vertebrae of the loins. Their origin, like that of the latiflimus, is by a thin tendinous expanfion: it foon becomes flefliy, and, dividing into three, fometixnes four, flefliy ftraps or

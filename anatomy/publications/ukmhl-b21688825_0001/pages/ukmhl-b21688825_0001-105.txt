INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. 6s About an inch above the fquamous future, there is a" femicircular ridge, where the bone is particularly white and hard ; and rays extend downwards from this, con- verging towards the jugum, or arch of the temple. The white femicircular line reprefents the origin of the temporal mufcle ; and the converging lines exprefs the manner in which the fibres of the mufcle are gathered into a fmaller compafs, to pafs under the jugum. The fagittal future, or meeting of the two parietals, is marked on the infide with a groove as big as the fin- ger, which holds the longitudinal finus, or great vein of the brain: but the groove is not fo diflindly feen, unlefs the two bones be put together ; for one half of this flat groove belongs to each bone. The great artery of the dura mater touches this bone at that angle of it which lies in the temple. It traverfes the bone from comer to corner, fpreading from the firfl point, like the branches of a tree, it beats deep into the bone where it firft touches it; but where it expands into branches, its impreffions are very flight; commonly it makes a groove only, but fome- times it is entirely buried in the bone; fo that at the lower corner of the parietal bone we cannot efcape cut- ting thisveffel, if we are forced to operate with the trepan. There- is but one hole in the parietal bone; it is fmall and round, is within one inch of the meeting of the lambdoida! and faggital futures, and gives paffage to a fmall external- vein, which goes inwards to the firms; and to a fmall artery which goes alfo inwards to the dura mater, or rather to the mix. The meeting of the frontal and oan ta! bones, being imperfeft in the child, leaves that membraneous in- terface,

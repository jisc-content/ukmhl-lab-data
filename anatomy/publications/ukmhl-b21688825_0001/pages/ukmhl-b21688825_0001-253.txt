FACE, EYE, AND EAR. 209 is direftly oppofite to the obliquus fuperior, in form, place, office, &c. ; for it arifes from the nafal procefs of the jaw-bone, in the lower edge of the orbit, at the inner corner of the eye : it is ffiort, flat, and broad, with a ftrong fleffiy belly ; it goes obliquely backwards and outwards, lying under the ball of the eye ; and it is inferted broad and flat into the ball, exactly oppofite to the infertion of the obliquus fuperior mufcle. Thefe two mufcles roll the eye, whence they are na- med musculi CIRCUMAGENTES, Or AMATORII. But they have dill another important office, viz. fupporting the eyeball, for the operation of its ftraight mufcles; for when thefe (the obliqui) aft, they pull the eye for- wards ; the ftraight mufcles refill; and the infertion of the oblique mufcles at the middle of the eyeball -be- comes, as it were, a fixed point, a centre or axis round which the eyeball turns under the operation of the refti mufcles. The conjoined effeft of the oblique muf- cles is to bring the eyeball forwards from the fccket, as in draining the eye to fee fame diftant point. The particular effeft of the upper oblique mufcle is not to bring the eye forward, but to roll the eye fo as to turn the pupil downwards, and towards the nofe. And the particular effeft of the lower oblique mufcle is to re- verie this aftion, to turn the eye again upon its axis, and to direft the pupil upwards and outwards; but the fucceflive actions of all thefe mufcles move the eye in circles, with gradations fo exquifitely final 1, and with fuch curious combinations as cannot be explained by words. p VOL. 1, CHAP.

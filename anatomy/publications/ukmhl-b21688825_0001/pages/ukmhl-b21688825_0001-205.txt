THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT. l6i vol. 1, M tarfal is paired a pencil. It is this fecond arch which gives a perfect elafticity to the foot, and muil prevent the bad effefts of leaping, falls, and other ihocks, which would have broken a part lefs curioufly adapted to its office. 1. The astragalus is the greateil and moil re- markable bone of the tarfus ; and which the fur- geon is moil concerned in knowing. The femicir- cular head of this bone forms a curious and perfedt pulley. The circle of this pulley is large; its cartilage is fmooth and lubricated; it is received deep betwixt the tibia and fibula ; and rolls under the fmooth ar- ticular furface of the latter, which being fuited to this pulley of the aftragalus, with fomething of a boat-like ffiape, is often named the fcaphoid cavity of the tibia, i. We remark in the aftragalus its ar- ticulating furface, which is arched, high, fmooth, co- vered with cartilage, lubricated, and in ail refpeds a complete joint. Its form is that of a pulley, which, of courfe, admits of but one'diredt motion, viz. forwards and backwards, i. We obferve its fides, which are plain, fmooth, and flat, covered with the fame cartilage, forming a part of the joint, and clofely locked in by the inner and outer angles, fo as to prevent luxations or aukward motions to either fide. 3, We obferve two large irregular articulating furfaces backwards, by which it is joined to the os calcis. 4. There is on the fore part, or rather the fore end of the aftragalus, a large round head, as regular as the head of the fhoulder bone, by which it is articulated with the fcaphoid bone* 2. The os calcis is the large irregular bone of the heel j it is the tip or end of the arch formed by the

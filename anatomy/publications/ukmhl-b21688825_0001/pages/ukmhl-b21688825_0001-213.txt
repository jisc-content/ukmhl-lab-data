SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. 16p 5. This lower border of the fcapula, receives no mufcles, be- caufe humuft be quite free, to move and glide as the fcapula turns upon its axis, which is indeed its ordinary movement. But it gives rife to two fmaller mufcles, which, from being a little rounded, are named the mufculi teres; which round mufcles being implanted into the arm bone, pull it downwards. The long fide of the fcapula, which bounds its tri- angular form backwards, is named the basis of the scapula, as it reprefents the bafe of the triangle. This line is alfo like the two borders, a little thicker, or fwelled out; and this edge receives many powerful mufcles, which lie flat upon the back, and coming to the fcapula in a variety of directions, can turn it upon its axis, fometimes railing fometimes deprefling the fcapula ; fometimes drawing it backwards ; and fome- times fixing it in its place, according to the various fets of fibres which are put into action, 4. The GLENOID, or ARTICULATING CAVITY of the fcapula, is on the point or apex of this triangle. The fcapula is more Unfitly triangular in a child, for it ter- minates almoft in a point or apex ; and this articulating furface is a feoarate offification, and is ioined to it in the adult. The fcapula towards this point terminates in a flat furface, not more than an inch in diameter, very little hollowed, and fcarcely receiving the head of the fhoulder bone, <?which is rather laid upon it than funk into it 1 It is indeed deepened a little by a circular griflle, which tips the edges or lips of this ar- ticulating furface, but fo little, that it is (till very (hal- low and plain, and luxations of the fhoulder are in- finitely more frequent than of any other bone.

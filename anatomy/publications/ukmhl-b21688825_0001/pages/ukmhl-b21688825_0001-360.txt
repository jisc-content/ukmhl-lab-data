$l6 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN, fymphyfis pubis with a flat and pointed tendon about an inch in length and about an inch broad. This mufcle is eroded at intervals by four tendinous inter- fedions, which divide it into five diflind bellies. Com- monly there are three bellies above the umbilicus and two below ; but the redi mufcles are the lead: regular of all the mufcles of the abdomen. Vefalius, Albinus, and Sabbatier, were thought to have found the redi abdominis extending up to the throat; but it is now found that Vefalius had only reprefented the mufcles of a monkey or of a dog (which are very long) upon the thorax of a human fubjed * ; Sabbatier, upon re- vifiting his notes, retrads what he had faid ; and Albi- nos alfo is fuppofed to have feen only a produdion of the mafloid mufcle, extending down the bread:; for irregularities of this kind are very often found. CXLVII. the pyramidal mufcles are as a fupple- ment to the redi. There is a fmall neat pyramidal muf- cle on each fide, or rather a triangular mufcle, flefhy through its whole extent and length, with its bafe turn- ed towards the pubis and its apex towards the umbili- cus ; fo that its origin is in the creff of the pubis and its pointed infertion in the linea alba : and though the pyramidal mufcles have been fuppofed by Mada to re- * “ Porro (r) linea infignitur, quae carneam redti mufeuli par- w tem finit, quasque ultima ipfius infertionis in homine eft portio* “ uti in qugrta tabula ad chara&erem n. eft cernere.

248 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. muft act, to defcribe the circular and rotatory motions of the arm. Joints are more ftrengthened by the origin and in- fertion of mufcles around them, than by elaftic liga- ments : for thefe yield or tear; whereas the mufcles, having a living power, re-aft againft any feparating force; they contract, or, in other words, they are ftrong in proportion to the violence that the joint fuffers. Thus, in the fhoulder, the capfule is fo lax, that there is a mechanical contrivance to prevent its being checked in the joint; and it is moreover fo weak, that inde- pendent of its yielding eafily, it is alfo very eafily torn ; " but thefe 'mufcles furround the joint fo fairly, that their ftrength and their tendinous infertions into the head of the bone are more than a compenfation for the loofenefs of its capfular ligament. Were not the muf- cles thus clofely attached, the fhoulders would be very often difplaced, the glenoid cavity is fo fuperficial, and the burfa fo lax : and furely it is for fome fuch purpofe that the mufcles are planted fo clofely round the head of the bone ; for when they are implanted at a diftance from the centre, as one mufcle, the deltoid, is, or as the biceps and triceps of the arm, or as the hamftrings, or tendo Achillis are, the power is much increafed. Here, in the humerus, power is facrificed to the firm- nefs of the joint, and they are all implanted clofely round the head of the bone. The joint is in a manner formed by thefe mufcles ; for the fupra fpinatus, infra fpinatus, teres major and minor, and the fubfcapularis, furround the joint very clofely; cover the joint with their flat tendons; and fo thicken the capfule, and increafe its ftrength.

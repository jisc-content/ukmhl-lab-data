AND GROWTH OF BONES. 7 and Ample, of any that are recorded in the philo- fophy of the animal body: for if bones were but â– condenfed gluten, coagulated blood, or a mere depofition from the periofteum, they were then in- organized, and out of the fyftem, not fubjedt to change, nor open to difeafe ; liable, indeed, to be broken, but without any means of being healed again: while they are, in truth, as fully organized, as per- meable to the blood, as eafdy hurt, and as eafily healed, as fenfible to pain, and as regularly changed as the fofter parts are. We are not to refer the generation and growth of bone to any one part. It is not formed by that gelly in which the bone is layed; nor by the blood which is circulating in it; nor by the periofteum which covers it; nor by the medullary membrane with which it is lined: but the whole fyftem of the bone, of which thefe are parts on- ly, is deftgned and planned, is laid out in the very ele- ments of the body, and advances to ripenefs by the con- curring adlion of all its parts. The arteries, by a de- termined adlion, depofite the bone; which is formed commonly in a bed of cartilage, as the bones of ther leg or arm are ; fometimes betwixt two layers of mem- brane, like the bones of thelkull, where true cartilage is never feen. Often the fecretion of the bony mat- ter is performed in a diftindt bag, and there it grows into form, as in the teeth; for each tooth is formed in its little bag, which, by injedtion, can be filled and covered with veffels. Any artery of the body may affume this adlion, and depofite bone, which is fome- times alfo formed where it fhould not be ; in the ten- dons and in the joints., in the great arteries, and in J3 4 their

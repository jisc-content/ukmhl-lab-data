H3 OF THE TRUNK mgs could not part without pain and lamenefs, per* haps inability for life. One chief reafon drawn from anatomy is this : that in women dying after labour, the griftles of the pelvis are manifeftly foftened ; the bones loofen ; and though they cannot be pulled afunder, they can be Ihuffled or moved upon each other in a flight degree : all which is eafily accounted for. The griftle that forms the fymphyfis pubis is not one griftle only, as was once fuppofed, but a peculiar griftle covers the end of each bone, and thefe are joined by a membranous or ligamentous fubftance : This ligamentous fubftance is the part which corrupts the fooneft ; it is often fpoil- ed, and in the place of it a hollow only is found j that hollow of the corrupted ligament may be called a feparation of the bones ; but it is fuch a feparation as 44 equals only the back of a common knife in breadth, 44 and will not allow the bones to depart from each 44 other the joining is ftill ftrong, for it is furrounded by a capfular ligament, not like the loofe ligament of a moveable joint, but adhering to every point of each bone : and this ligament does perform its office fo completely, that while it remains entire, though the bones ffiuffle fidewife upon each other, no force can pull them afunder: 44 Even when the fore-part of 44 the pelvis is cut out, and turned and twifted betwixt 44 the hands, ftill though the bones can be bent 44 backwards and forwards, they cannot be pulled 44 from each other the tenth part of an inch.‚Äù Thefe inquiries were made by one, who, though partial to the other fide of this queftion, could not allow himfelf to difggife the truth, whofe authority is the higheft,

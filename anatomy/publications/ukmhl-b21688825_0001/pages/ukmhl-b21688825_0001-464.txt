JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE. 420 All the other vertebras have another kind of articu- lation; to which the occiput, atlas, and dentatus, are the only exceptions; for their motions are particular, and quite different from the refl. The atlas and den- tatus bend, turn, and roll, by connexions refembling the common joints of the body; but the other vertebras are united, each by its intervertebp.al substance, to the bones above and below; they are alfo united by their articulating proceffes to each other: each ar- ticulating procefs is held to another by a diflinX cap- fule; each intervertebral fubflance is fecured, bound down, and flrengthened by flrong ligaments; for the intervertebral fubftance, which of itfelf adheres very ftrongly to the periofleum, and to the rough focket- like furface upon the body of each vertebra, is further fecured by a fort of crofs ligament, which go from the rim or edge of one vertebra to the edge of the next, over the intervertebral fubflance; and fo, by ad- hering to the intervertebral fubflance, they flrengthen it. Thefe ligaments crofs each other over the interflice. betwixt each vertebra, and are very flrong. They are very regular, beautiful, and fhining, and are named INTERVERTEBRAL LIGAMENTS. The fpine is further fecured by a general ligamen- tous or tendinous expanfion, which goes over the fore parts of all the vertebras from top to bottom of the fpine. It begins at the fore part of the atlas; if al- mofl paffes the body of the dentatus, or is but very but the ligament from the point of the tooth-like procefs is not what it has been fuppofed, a fair round ligament of fome llrength; there is nothing more than a few ftraggling fibres of ligament going from the point to the occiput, though Euftachius has drawn it round and flrong. flightly

OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 295 The u 4 order is this: i. The trapezius ; 2. The splenius capitis; 3. The splenius cervicjs; 4. The Tra- chelo-mastoideus. It is needlefs to fpeak of its ufe, fmce the life of all thefe mufcles is to draw the head backwards direddly, when both add; obliquely, when one adds alone. The recti muscles are two deep-feated mufcles, which go immediately from the vertebra to the occiput to be inferted into its lower ridge. They are called major and minor. CXXI. The rect.us minor is the fhorter of the two, arifing from the firft vertebra of the neck. Its place of origin is a fmall tuber which Hands in the place of the tranfverfe procefs of the firft vertebra ; and from that point where it is tendinous, it goes up to the occipital ridge, and is inferted flelhy. CXXII. The rectus major is larger. It rifes, in like manner, tendinous, from the fecond vertebra of the neck at its tranfverfe procefs, and mounting from that, is inferted flelhy into the lower ridge of the oc- ciput without the former. Thefe are fo placed, that the reddi minores appear in the interface of the recti majores. And though we call them both reddi, yet they cannot truly be fo; for the recti minores muft be, in fome degree, oblique, and the redti majores (till more fo: and confequently, although their chief ufe be conjointly to draw the head direddly backwards, yet one adding muft turn the head to its fide, And indeed the fame may be faid of all the mufcles of the neck ; for they are all divided by the fpine, and confequently they are all oblique,

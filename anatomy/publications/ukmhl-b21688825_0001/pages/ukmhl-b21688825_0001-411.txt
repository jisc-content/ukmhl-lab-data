MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG* 36? Foot j fo it preffes to the ground the ball of the great toe; and that is the part which touches the ground, and which feels fore after long walking or violent leaping or running; It is by that part that we pufh in making a ftep; fo that this mufcle is perceived to be continually adtive in all motions of walking, leap- ing, running, and more particularly in dancing. CLXXXV. The peronjeus brevis is like its fel- low except in length and infertion. Its origin is from the ridge of the fibula; beginning about one-third down the bone, and continuing its adhefton the whole way to the ankle. It alfo has adhelions to the tendi- nous partition which is betwixt it and the common extenfor; fo that thefe two mufcles are by fuch ad- hefions very difficult to diffeft. It is fmaller at its origin, but increafes in its flefliy belly as it defcends; and it is flefhy lower down 'chan the peronseus longus. It is like it, a penniform mufcle. The tendons of the two peronsei pafs together by the outer ankle in the fame ring ; but the tendons crofs each other; for the peronseus longus is in its belly more forward. The brevis lies' under and behind it, quite covered by it; and yet the tendon of the brevis, by creeping under the longus, gets before it, juft under the outer ankle; and from that it runs in a feparate groove, fuperficially, upon the outer edge of the foot, to ,be inferted into the metatarfal bone of the little toe. In both muf- cles the tendon is upon the outer edge, and begins al- mofl as high as the upper head of each mufcle. This tendon of the peronseus brevis is the fhorier one, is fmall where it paffes through the pulley, and expands when it reaches its infertion, that it may grafp the metatarfal

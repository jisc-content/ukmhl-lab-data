MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN, 326 line of this tendinous centre is fixed by the mem- brane which divides the thorax into two ; the two fides go upwards into the two fides of the cheft, each with a form like the bottom of an inverted bafm ; their con- vexity reaching within the thorax, quite up to the level of the fourth true rib: the proper centre of the dia- phragm is fixed by this connexion with the mediaf- tinum, that its motion might not diforder the action of the heart, which refts upon this point, and whofe pericardium is fixed to the tendon : but the convexity of either fide defcends and afcends alternately as the diaphragm contracts or is relaxed ; fo that it is chiefly thefe convexities on either fide which are moved in breathing. Thus is the diaphragm compofed of one great and circular mufcle before; of one fmaller circular muf- cle behind ; and of the triangular tendon, as the cen- tre betwixt them: and both in its flefhy and tendi- nous parts, it is perforated by feveral veffels palling reciprocally betwixt the thorax and the abdomen. Fir ft, The aorta or great artery of the trunk pafles betwixt the crura or legs of the diaphragm, which like an arch ftride over it to defend it from prefliire. * Secondly, The oesophagus pafles through the dia- phragm a little above this, and to the left fide: its paflage is through the lower flefhy belly, and through the mod flefhy part of the diaphragm: and the muf- cular fibres of the crura diaphragmatis firft crofs un- der the hole for the oefophagus, then furround it, then crofs again above the hole; fo that they form the figure of 8 : and the oefophagus is fo apparently comprefied by thefe furrounding fibres, that fome anatomifts

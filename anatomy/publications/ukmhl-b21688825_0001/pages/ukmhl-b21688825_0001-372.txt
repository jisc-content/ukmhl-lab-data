328 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. the lungs; but the lungs follow the ribs and diaphragm as clofely as if they adhered to them ; and indeed when they do adhere, it is not known by any diftrefs ; fo we draw in the breath : and when the abdominal mufcles re-ad, the diaphragm yields, goes back into the thorax, and grows convex again, by which we blow out the breath ; and while the diaphragm is ading, the abdo- minal mufcles are relaxed, yield, and are pufhed out, and leave the ribs free to be raifed by their levator muf- cles. And again, when the abdominal mufcles re-ad, the diaphragm in its turn yields fo that they at once force up the diaphragm, and pull down the borders of the thorax, affifting the ferrated mufcles which deprefs the ribs. There is alfo in every great fundion fuch a won- derful combination of adions confpiring to one end, as cannot be even enumerated here. But the alternate adion and re-adion of the abdominal mufcles draws in and expels the breath, promotes the circulation, and gently agitates the bowels, while their more violent adions difcharge the feces and urine, and affift the womb; and vomiting, yawning, coughing, laughing, crying, hiccup, and the r-ft, are its flronger and irre- gular adions. The diaphragm might well be named by Haller, c< Nobiliffimus, poll cor, mufculus.” And Buffon, who affeded the charader of anatomiff with but little knowledge of the human body, might miftake its central tendon for a nervous centre, the place of all m aons, and almoll the feat of the foul. For the an- cients confounded the names and ideas of tendon and nerve. And in feknefs and oppreflion, lownefs and fighing, in weeping or laughing, in joy or in fear, all our feelings feem to concentrate in this part. CHAP.

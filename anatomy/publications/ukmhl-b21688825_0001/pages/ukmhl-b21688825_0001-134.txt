90 OF THE BONES joined again. This meeting of the palate plates by a broad furface, makes a rifing fpine, or fliarp ridge to- wards the noftrils ; fo that the broadnefs of the furface by which thefe bones meet, ferves a double purpofe j it joins the bones fecurely, and it forms a fmall ridge upon which the fplit edge of the vomer, or partition of the nofe, is planted. Thus we find the palate plate of the maxillary bones conjoined ; forming almofl the whole of the palate, while what are properly called the palate bones form a very fmall fhare of the back part only. As thefe thinner bones of the face have no marrow, they are nourifhed by their periofteum only; they are of courfe perforated with many fmall holes. A great many minute holes are found along the palate plate, about the place of the fockets, and indeed all over the maxillary bones, And this is par- ticular in the palate, that the hard membrane or co- vering of it, is fixed to the bony plate by many rough tubercles, and even by fmall hooks, which are eafily feen in the dried bone. 6. The antrum maxillare, or cavity of the jaw- bone, is commonly named antrum highmorianum, after its difcoverer Highmore, We have gone round the antrum, on all its fides, in defcribing thefe prccefles of the bone. The palate plate makes the floor of the antrum; the orbitary procefs makes its roof; the cheek, quite up from the fockets of the teeth to the lower part of the eye, forms it walls, or fides; fo that when the antrum enlarges, it is the cheek that becomes de- formed ; and when we defign to open the antrum, we either perforate the cheek, or pull one of the teeth. The antrum is concave towards the cheek, but it

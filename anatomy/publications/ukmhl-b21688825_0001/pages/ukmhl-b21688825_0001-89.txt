<5F THE SKULL IN GENERAL. 45 V the cs frontis being formed in two larger pieces, their edges meet early in life, and they form a future ; but the bones continuing to grow, their oppofite points force deeper and deeper into each other, till at lafl the future is entirely obliterated, and the bones unite ; and fo this future is found always in the child, feldom in the adult, almod never in old age. The occipital bone having four points, they are clofer upon each other, they meet early, are foon united ; and although very didindt in the child, no middle future has ever been found in the adult, but always the four pieces are uni- ted into one firm and perfect bone. The parietal bones have their rays mod of ail fcattered ; the rays of offi- fication run out to a great diftanee, and diverge from one fingle point, fo that at their edges they are extreme- ly loofe, and they never fail to form futures, by admit- ting into their interftices the points and edges of the adjoining bones. The furell and mod condant fu- tures are thofe formed by the edges of the parietal bones ; the fagittal in the middle, the coronal over the forehead, the lambdoidal behind, and the fquamous fu- ture formed by the lower edges. But another phe- nomenon refults at the fame time, from this meeting and oppofition of the fibres and interdices of the grow- ing bones : that when the oppofite fibres meet too ear- ly, they are not fairly admitted into the open fpaces of the oppofite bone : but the fibres of each bone be- ing diredtly oppofed point to point, they both turn in- wards, and form a ridge or fpine, fuch as is feen on the inner furfaces of the frontal and occipital bones. Such is the common theory, which I fufpecl is imperfedt, and which fhould be received with fome referve, for all

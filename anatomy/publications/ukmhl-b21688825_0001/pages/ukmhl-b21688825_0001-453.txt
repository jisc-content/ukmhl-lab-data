LIGAMENTS, BURSiE, &C. 409 bones. The periodeum, tendons, fafcise, and burfse mucofae, are all of one fubdance, and of one common nature j they are various modifications of that dead matter which, having but little vafcularity, and no feeling, and hardly any difpofition to difeafe, is the fitted: for its office, and bears the roughed: ufage in our experiments, and the mod violent fhocks in the motions of the body, without any figns of feeling, and without falling into difeafe. 6. Thefe tendons mud be bound firmly down ; for if they were to rife from the bones during the actions of the mufcles to which they belong, the effect of contradtion would be lod, and they would diforder the joint, darting out in a draight line from bone to bone like a bow-dring over the arch of a bow. The fame inanimate fubdance dill performs this office alfo ; for the tendons of one mufcle often fplit to form a fheath or ring for the next; or their tendons after taking hold of the bone, fpread their expanfion out over all the bone, fo as to form an entire fheath for the finger and toe; or there is a wide groove in the bone which receives the tendons, and it is lined with a cartilage and with a lubricated membrane; the mem- brane comes off from the lips of the groove, or from corners or edges of the bone, paffes over the tendons fo as to form a bridge, or often it forms a longer fheath, as in the fingers, or where the peronsei mufcles pafs behind the ankle; and thus the vagina or si-ieaths of the tendons are connefted with the tendons, pe- riodeum, and other modifications of the common cel- lular membrane. 7. The periodeuin> which has run ajong one bone, leaves it at the head, and forming a bag for the joint, goes

OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL. 37 tlie diploe, or cancelli. The cancelli, or lattice work, is a net of membranes, covered with Veffels, partly for fecreting marrow, and partly for nourilhing the bone ; and by the dura mater adhering to the internal fur- face, and fending in arteries, which enter into the can- celli by palling through the fubltance of the bone, and by the pericranium covering the external plate, and giving veifels from without, which alfo enter into the bone, the whole is conne&ed into one fyftem of veifels. The pericranium, dura mater, and Ikull, de- pend fo entirely, one upon the other, and are fo fairly parts of the fame fyllem of veifels, that an injury of the pericranium fpoils the bone ; feparates the dura mater, and caufes effufion upon the brain ; a repara- tion of the dura mater is, in like manner, followed by reparation of the pericranium, which had been found and unhurt ; and every difeafe of the cancelli, or fub- ftance of the bone, is communicated both ways ; in- ward to the brain, fo as to occalion very imminent dan- ger ; outwards towards the integuments, fo as to warn us that there is difeafe. The general thicknefs of the fkull, and the natural order of two tables, and an in- termediate diploe, is very regular, in all the upper parts of the head. In perforating with the trepan, we fir ft cut with more labour, through the external table j when we arrive at the cancelli, there is lefs refiftance, the inftrument moves with eafe ; there is a change of found, and blood comes from the tearing of thefe vef- fels, which run in the cancelli, betwixt the tables of the fkull. Surgeons thought themfelves fo well allured of parts, each of which is a line. The French line, or twelfth of an inch, is a meafure which I {hall often have occalion to ufe. E) 3 thefe

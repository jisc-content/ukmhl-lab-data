MUSCLES OF THE PARTS OF 334 ere&ions, a defire to pafs the urine, and an ob ft ruction in the difcharge of it. CLV.The musculus cocc ygjeus is a thin, flat, muf- cle, which arifes by a narrow point from the infide of the pelvis at the fpine of the os ifchium ; is implanted, expanded, and flefhy, into the whole length of the os coccygis; can be ufeful only by pulling up the point of the os coccygis, which is juft equivalent to railing the circle of the anus; fo that from every circum- ftance of its form and ufe, it might be fairly enough defcribed as being merely the back part of the levator ani mufcle. The perinasum, where the bulb begins, is the point into which all the mufcles are united ; for the accelera- tor mufcle, and the fphincter ani mufcle, touch at the beginning or point of the bulb; and a fmall pointed flip of the fphincter ani, going upon the bulb, con- nects them firmly together. The tranfverfalis perinasi come acrofs the perinasum from either fide ; and the le- vator ani mufcle comes down to meet the fphinCter; fo that the fphinCter ani, the levator ani, the tranfverfalis perinasi, and the accelerator urinae mufcles, all meet in one point, viz. the back of the bulb. They fecure the perinaeum, and lupport the heavy vifcera of the abdo- men : if they be unlkilfully cut in performing litho- tomy, it will be difficult to extract the ftone. In that operation the incifion paffes by the fide of the anus, and on the infide of the tuber ifchii; and our knife accordingly cuts clean acrofs the tranfverfe mufcles, which ftand as a bar acrofs the perinaeum; it paffes by the fide of the ereCtor mufcle, need not touch it, or touches it flightly, and by a fort of chance : It muft r not

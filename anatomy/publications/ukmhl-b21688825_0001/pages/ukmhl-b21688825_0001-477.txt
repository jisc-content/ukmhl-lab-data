SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. ' 433 Â«Tid this peculiar ligament of the radius is named liga- mentum coronarium, becaufe it encircles the neck of the radius; anulare or orbiculare,from its hoop or ring-like form. It is a very ftrong and narrow flripe or band, which arifes from that part of the ulna where the radius rolls upon it, and furrounds the ra- dius, making at leafl two-thirds of a circle; and fo having turned over the neck of the radius, is inferted Into the oppofite fide of thd ulna. This is commonly defcribed as a diftindt ligament furrounding the neck of the radius, and having the common capfule implanted Into its upper edge; but in truth it is, like the others* a thicker band of the common capfule, but with a diftindlion much more particular here, by the contrail of the great thicknefs of the coronary ligament, and the extreme thinnefs of the capfule at the fore part: for the capfule of every hinge-joint is ftrong only at its lides; other bands from the outer condyle, and from the coronary procefs of the ulna, ftrengthen this ligament of the radius, and are known by the gene- ral name of accessory ligaments of the coronoid ligament, as the lateral ones are known by the name of accessory ligaments to the capfule. So that there is 1. A complete capfule which enclofes all the bones; 2. Lateral ligaments which make the main llrength of the joint; 3. A coronary ligament which regulates and Hrengthens the rolling motions of the radius, and keeps it firm, turning like a fpindle in its bufh. The whole joint is furrounded with cellular Jubilance; the regularity of its ligaments is confound- ed by the adhefions of mufcles and tendons: though it is, on the whole, weak behind and before, and very VOL. 1. f f ftrong

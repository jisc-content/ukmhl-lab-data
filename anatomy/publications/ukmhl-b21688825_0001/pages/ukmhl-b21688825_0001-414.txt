MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES, 37° MUSCLES OF THE TOES. The long mufcles of the toes are juft four, two flex- or and two extensor muscles. The flexor mufcles lie upon the tibialis pofticus, or behind betwixt it and the folasus. The extenfor mufcles again lie under the tibialis anticus, or at leaft their heads are under it, and their bellies only appear from under it about the mid- dle of the leg. The flexor tendons follow the tendon of the tibialis pofticus by the pulley of the inner ankle into the hol- low of the foot. The tendons of the extenfor mufcles keep with that of the tibialis anticus, and crofs over the fore part or rifing of the ankle, where the tibia is united with the aftragalus. And in diflection we muft •follow thefe in an oppofite order to that in which they are defcribed ; for next to the fore part of the folseus is, ift, The flexor pollicis ; 2dly, The flexor digitorum ; and 3dly, The tibialis anticus. CLXXXVIII. The flexor longus pollicis is fmall and pointed at its origin, and arifes flefliy from three-fourths of the fibula to within an inch of the outer ankle. It grows thicker and larger as it defcends, and adheres to the tendinous partitions of the tibialis pofticus and of the peronsei. Its tendon can be feen only about an inch above the joint of the ankle. It pafles down behind the inner ankle, where it is bound in a fort annular ligament. It there pafles under the heel-bone, in the arch of the foot, betwixt the bones and the abductor pollicis ; it then glides into the chan- nel made by the two heads of the flexor pollicis bre- vis ; it then pafles betwixt the two fefamoid bones at the

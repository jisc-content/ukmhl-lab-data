45 8 THE JOINTS OF carnea and the belly of the fhort flexor mufcles: But whenever they touch the flrd joints of their toes, they once more rub againd a hard hone. New burfe are formed for the tendons. Each burfa is a diflind bag, running along the flat face of the toe, and is of a long fnape, and the tendon is carried through the centre of the lubricated bag ; fo that we fee once more that there is no true diflin&ion betwixt bur fee mucofae and tendi- nous (heaths, nor betwixt the tendinous (heaths and the capfules of joints* Joints have been arranged under various forms, but not with much fuccefs; and I do not know that enu- merating the joints in any particular order will either explain the motions of individual joints, or affid in recording their various forms ; fome joints are loofe and free, capable of eafy motions, but weak in pro- portion, and liable to be difplaced; fuch is the joint of the shoulder, which rolls in every direction : other rolling joints, more limited in their motions, are better fecured with ligaments of peculiar ftrength ; fuch is the joint of the hip, where the ligaments are of great ftrength both within and without: fome, want- ing all circular motions, are hinge-joints by the mere form of their bones ; fuch are the lower jaw, the vertebrae, the elbow, and the ankle-joints : fome are hinges by their ligaments, which are then dif- pofed only along the (ides of the bones ; fuch are the knee, the ribs, the fingers, and the toes. Some joints partake of either motion with all the freedom of a ball and a focket-joint, yet with the ftrength and fecurity of the drifted hinge : Thus the wrist, hav- ing one joint by which its turning motions are per- formed,

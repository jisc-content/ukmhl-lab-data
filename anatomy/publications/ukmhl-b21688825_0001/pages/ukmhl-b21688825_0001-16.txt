PREFACE. X anatomy, the furgeon could not move one Hep in his great operations; and thofe theories could not even be conceived, which fo often ufurp the place of that very fcience, from which they Ihould flow as proba- bilities and conjectures only, drawn from its ftore of fads. A confcioufnefs of the high value of anatomical knowledge never entirely leaves the mind of the ftu- dent. He begins with a ftrong conviction that this is the great ftudy, and with an ardent defire to mailer all its difficulties: if he relaxes in the purfuit, it is from the difficulties of the talk, and the feduction of theories too little dependent on anatomy, and too eafily ac- ceffible without its help. His defire for real know- ledge revives only when the opportunity is loft ; when he is to leave the fchools of medicine ; when he is to cive an account of his ftudies with an anxious and O oppreifed mind, confcious of his ignorance in that branch which is to be received as the chief teft of his profeffional (kill; or when, perhaps, he feels a more ferious and manly impreffion, the difficulty and im- portance of that art which he is called to practife. Yet, in fpite of feeling and reafon, the ftudent en- courages in himfelf a tafte for fpeculations and theories, the idle amufements of the day, which, even in his own ffiort courfe of ftudy he may obferve finking in quick fucceffion into negleft and oblivion, never to re- vive

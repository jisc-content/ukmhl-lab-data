MUSCLES OF THE Â«J\6 name. And thefe cartilages being covered with the common membrane of the throat, which is thick, and full of mucous glands, the opening gets a regular ap- pearance with rounded lips ; and this opening, or flit between them, which is fomething like the flit for the hill in the top of a counter, and which flaunts oblique- ly downwards is named the rima glottidis, or chink of the glottis ; and thefe cartilages being fixed on the cricoid cartilage by a regular hinge, they form the voice by their nearnefs and the narrownefs of the flit; and modify it by their motions, which are fo exquifite- ly minute, that for every changing of the note (and there are fome thoufand gradations in the compafs of the voice), they move in a proportioned degree. The epiglottis is a fifth cartilage of the trachea, belonging to it both by connexion and by office. It is a broad triangular cartilage, not fo hard as the others, very elaflic, and fo exactly like an artichoke leaf, that no other figure can reprefent it fo well. Its office is to defend the opening of the glottis. It is fixed at once to the os hyoides, to the thyroid cartilage, and to the root of the tongue, and it hangs obliquely backwards over the opening of the rima, or chink, of the glottis j it is fufpended by little peaks of the membrane, which we call ligaments of the glotds, and it is faid to be raifed or deprefled by mufcles which yet are not very fairly defcribed. But the rolling of the morfel which is fwallowed, and the motion of the tongue, are fuffin cient to lay it flat over the rima, fo that it is a perfedt guard. Then this is the conftitution of the larynx. It is of hard cartilages to refill compreffion, and of a flute' form

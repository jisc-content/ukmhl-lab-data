448 JOINTS OF THE where they are lead expofed to harm); thence it has been long named the ligamentum mucosum. The internal membrane of the joint covers alfo the femi- lunar ligaments as a perichondrium; it comes off from the ridge of the tibia, touches the horns of the femilunar cartilages, moves over the cartilage fo as to give them their coat; and at the point where it firft touches the horns it forms four little ligaments, two for the horns of each cartilage. Thefe tags, by which the four points of the lunated cartilages are tied, are named the ligament a cartilaginumlun at arum, or more fimply named the four adhefions of the luna- ted cartilages. There is a little flip of ligament which goes round upon the fore part of the knob of the ti- bia, and ties the fore parts of thefe two cartilages to each other. It is named ligamentum transversale commune, becaufe it goes acrofs from the fore edge of the one cartilage to the fore edge of the other, and becaufe it belongs equally to each; but for their fur- ther fecurity, thefe cartilages alfo adhere to their outer circle or thick edge, to the internal furface of the general capfule of the joint, and that again adheres to the lateral ligaments which are without it; fo that there is every fecurity for thefe cartilages being firm enough in their places to bear the motions of the joint, and yet loofe enough to follow them eafily. This joint has the larged burfe mucofas of all, and thefe perhaps the mod frequently difeafed. There is one burfa above the patella, betwixt the common tendon of the extenfor mufcles and the fore part of the thigh-bone, which is no lefs than three inches in length. There is a fmaller burfa about an inch be- low

MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. 359 fixed, It mufl, by its origin from the pubis, be a flexcr of the thigh, and an adduCtor in nearly the fame direc- tion with the peSlineus and triceps; and it is worth obferving, that while the knee is.ftraight, the fartorius and the gracilis cannot bend the knee ; they, on the contrary, keep it heady and firm: but when the knee is benr, they come into aftion ; for in proportion as the mufcles wh.cn have made the flexion are contrac- ted, they are lefs able to contract farther; and there- fore it is defirable that more mufcles lhould come into play. CLXXVII. The semitendinosus is fo named from its lower half being compofed of a fmall round tendon; and as tendon was once mifnamed nerve, this is the seminervosus of Winflow, Douglas, and others. Its origin is from the tuberofity of the ifehium (along with the femimembranofus, and touching the biceps) by a fliort thick tendon. It alfo arifes by many oblique fafciculi of fibres from the pofterior portion of its oppofite mufcle the biceps cruris. This crofs connection betwixt the two mufcles continues for three inches down from the tuber ifehii; it then departs from the biceps, goes obliquely inwards, and is flattened and contracted into a tendon fix inches from the knee. Its tendon then becoming fmaller and rounder, pafies down behind the inner tubercle of the knee j and getting round the head of the tibia, it pomes for- ward to be inferted into the tuber at the head of that bone. At this place the tendon grows broad and flat; it is expanded, and as it were grafps the inner fide of the knee ; its upper edge is joined to the lower edge of the tendon pf the gracilis, fo that the fartorius, gracilis^ t A A

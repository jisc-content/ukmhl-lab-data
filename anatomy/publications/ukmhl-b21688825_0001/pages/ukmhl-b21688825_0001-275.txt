LOWER JAW, THROAT, AND TONGUE. 2%l Q 4 LXI, The lingualis is an irregular bundle of fibres which runs according to the length of the tongue: it lies betwixt the ftylo-gloffus and the genio-glolfus ; and as it is in the centre, and unconnected with any _bone, it is named lingualis, as arifing in the tongue itfelf. The genio-gloffi inufcles form by far the larger part of the tongue, and lie in the very centre. They go through the whole length (i. e.), from the root to the tip of the tongue ; and from the radiated form of their fibres, they perform every polfible motion; whence this was named by Window, Musculus folychres- tus, for its rays proceed from one point or centre, and thofe which go to the point of the tongue pull the tongue backwards into the mouth; thofe which go backwards, thruft the tongue out of the mouth ; the middle fibres afting, make the back of the tongue hollow, while the tip and the root of the tongue both rife. The hyo-glofii mufcles lie on either fide of the genio- hyoidaei, and make up the fides of the tongue; and their chief adtion would feem to be this, that the hyo- gloflus mufcle of either fide adting, the edges of the tongue would be pulled downwards, and the back rounded ; the oppofite of which motion is the genio- hyoidsei adting, by which the middle of the tongue is made into a groove ; the edges rifing, and the centre being deprefled. Laftly, The ftylo-gloffus is plainly- intended for drawing the tongue deep into the mouth, particularly affecting the point of the tongue. CHAP.

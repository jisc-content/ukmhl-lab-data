It is foon divided into two heads: one goes to the abdudtor, and the other goes to the adductor, to have the tendons inferted with, theirs into the root of the firfl: bone or phalanx. Thefe tendons contain the fefamoid bones ; and the parting of the two heads makes a channel for the tendon of the long flexor to run in- fo ufe is to bend the firfl: joint of the great toe. GXCIX. The adductor pollicis is the third and fall portion of the mufcle which encircles the great toe. It arifes from the heel-bone by a tendon as long al- moft as that which it gives the abductor : It does not immediately arife from the heel-bone ; but there is a ligament extended from the heel-bone to the os cu- boides, and it arifes from that ligament: This is the ligament under which the tendon of the peroneus longus glides. The addudtor is divided into two flefhy fafciculi or heads ; thefe unite, and, going obliquely inwards, are inferted either into the fefamoid bone, or directly into the firfl: bone of the great toe. CC. The transversal is pedis extends tranfi verfely acrofs the foie of the foot at the head of the rnetatarfal bones ; it is a very final! mufcle, and re^ fembles a good deal the palmaris brevis. It arifes from the ligament which connects the bones of the tarfus together ; and a fmall mufcular belly is formed, which is inferted into the tendon of the ad? DUCTOR POLLICIS. Its ufe is faid to be to make a fort of gutter in the foot, by drawing the heads of the rnetatarfal bones to- gethert

406 OF THE TENDONS, fo, that a want of it is painful, while a fuperabundance of it incumbers the body. And Haller feems to have believed, that a difeafed increafe of it might not only opprefs, but almoft annihilate, the mufcular fibre. 2. But it is ftill further eflfential to a mufcle, that while it moves, it thou Id neither be hurt itfelf nor harm the furrounding parts. Therefore, where one mufcle moves over another mufcle, foft flefh upon foft flefh like itfelf, there can be no hurtful fridtion, aijd the cellular fubftance is loofe and natural, preferving its common form. But where tendons rub upon tendons, or bones upon bones, or where tendons rub upon mufcles, or upon each other; fome defence is needed, and the cel- lular fubftance affumes a new form. The cells are run together into one large cell, with thicker coats, and a more copious exudation; fo that, being more liberally Bedewed with a gelatinous mucus, it prevents the bad effedts of fridtion, and is called a bursa mucosa, or mucous bag. Thefe mucous bags are placed under rubbing tendons, and chiefly about the greater joints 5 fome are large and others fmall; their glairy liquor is the fame with that which bedews the cellular fub- ftance or the cavities of the joints j and the provifion of nature is fo perfedt, that the occafions which re- quire burfe feem to form them by fridtion out of the common cellular fubftance. 3. It is often ufeful that an individual mufcle fhould be inclofed in a tendinous {heath, to give it ftrength and firmnefs, and to preferve it in its fhape. All mufcles, or almoft all mufcles, form for themfelves in- dividual (heaths, fuch as are feen inclofing the fupra- fpinatus and infraTpinatus of the fcapula j the biceps humeri.,

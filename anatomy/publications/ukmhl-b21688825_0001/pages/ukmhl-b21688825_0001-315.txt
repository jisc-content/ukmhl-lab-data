MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 2^1 and is accompanied all down to the wrift with feather- like flefhy fibres. It is fixed into the outfide of the lower head of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Its ufe is to extend the carpus. And it may be now obferved, that when the two extenfors of the wrift, the radialis and ulnaris, ad, the hand is bent diredly back- wards ; that when the flexor radialis and extenfor ra- dialis ad together, they bend the thumb towards the radius ; and that when the flexor ulnaris and extenfor ulnaris ad, they bend the little finger towards the ulna, as in cutting with the edge of the hand: thus a circle may be defcribed by ading with thofe in fuc- cefiion. XCVI. Extensor digitorum communis.â€”This mufcle correfponds with the fublimis and prqfundus, and antagonifes them, and refembles them in fhape as in ufe. It covers the middle of the fore-arm at its back, and lies betwixt the extenfor radialis fecundus and the extenfor minimi digiti. Its origin is chiefly from the outer condyle, by a ten- don common to it, with the extenfor carpi brevior, and alfo from the intermufcular membrane, which fe- parates it on one fide from the extenfor minimi digiti, and on the other from the extenfor carpi brevis, and alfo from the back part of the common fheath. It grows very flefhy and thick as it defcends, and about the middle of the fore-arm it divides itfelf into three flips of very equal fize. But though the tendons be-/ gin fo high, they continue, like thofe of the flexors, to receive flefhy penniforni fibres all down, almofl to the annular

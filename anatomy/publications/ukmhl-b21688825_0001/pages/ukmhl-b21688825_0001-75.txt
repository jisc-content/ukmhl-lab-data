31 AND GROWTH OF BONES. that fuch are infulated parts, maintained there by mere adhefion; but mufl confider them as parts re- gularly organized, their vafcular membrane being part of their living fyflem ; and though the tranfparent humours of the eye, the cartilages and ligaments over all the body, and all the fyflem of the bones, have been confidered as mere concretes, and infulated parts, they are now known to be regular parts of the living whole. The cartilages have no very active circulation ; it is fuch as to keep them in life, but not fo active as to en- danger inflammation; in the continual fhocks which they mufl endure, their feeling mufl be very obfcure, for feeling alfo would have been inconfiflent with their offices, which is to cover and defend the bones j to yield to the weight of the body, and to reftore them- felves when that weight is removed ; to bear all the fhocks of leaps or falls ; to perform all the motions of the body, and the continual workings of the joints where they rub, and even grate upon each other, with- out danger or pain. We now underftand the conflitution of a bone, and can compare it fairly with the foft parts in vafcularity, and in feeling j in quicknefs of abforption; in the regular fupply of blood neceflary to the life of the bony fyflem ; in the certain death of a bone, when deprived of blood by any injury of its marrow, or of its periofleum, as a limb dies of gangrene, when its arteries are cut or tied ; in the continual aÂ£tion of its abforbents, forming its cavity, fhaping its proceffes and heads, keeping it found and in good health, and regulating the degree of bony matter, that the compo- fition may neither be too brittle nor too foft.

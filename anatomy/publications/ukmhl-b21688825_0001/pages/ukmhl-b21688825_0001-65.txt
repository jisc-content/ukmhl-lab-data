AND GROWTH QF BONES. 21 and then difappears; the body, heads, and procefles, becoming one bone. In flat bones, as in the fkull, oflification goes from one or more central points, and the radiated fibres meet the radii of other oflifying points, or the edges of the next bone. The thick round bones which form the wrift and foot, have one oflification in their centre, which is bounded by car- tilage all round. The procefles are often diftindt ofli- fications joined to the bones, like their heads, and fiowly confolidated with them into firm bones *. While the bone is forming, various parts, efiential to its fyftem, gradually rife into view. At firft, we can- not in the long bone perceive any heads, procefles, cavities, or cells; thefe parts are very flowly formed, and are perfefted only in the adult bone. At firft, the whole length of a long bone is repre- fented by a tranfparent gelly ; where there is no diftinc- tion of heads nor procefles, it is all of one mafs. After the red blood has begun to tinge this cartilage, the oflification begins, and one ring is formed in the mid- dle of the bone: from this ring, the fibres ftretch to- wards either end, and flop there; then it begins to appear that the heads and body are diftindt parts ; the fibres of the growing bone have extended till the car- tilage is annihilated, and only a fmall plate remains, feparating the knobs of the heads from the long body of the bone. Thus, there is no diftindtion betwixt the heads and the body, while the bone is cartilaginous ; they begin to appear, as diftindt parts, at that ftage in which the body of the bone is oflified, and each of the * The procefles and heads are named the epiphyfis and apophyfis of bones. c 3 heads

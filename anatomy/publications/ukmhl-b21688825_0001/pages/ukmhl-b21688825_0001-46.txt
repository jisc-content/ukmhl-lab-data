4 OF THE FORMATION blood itfelf. He broke the bones of animals, and, examining them at various points of time, he never failed (like other fpeculators) to find exadly what he defined to find. In “ every experiment,” he found a great elfufion of blood among the mufcles, and round the broken bone: and he as eafily traced this blood through all the llages of its progrefs; on the firft day red and fluid; by and by coagulated; then gradually becoming white, then cartilaginous, and at laft (by the exhalation of its thinner parts) hardening into perfect bone. It is very Angular, that often thofe who abjure theory, and appeal to experiments, who profefs only to deliver fads, are leafl of all to be trufted; for it is theory which brings them to try experiments, and then the form and order; and even the refult of fuch experi- ments, mull: bend to meet the theories which they were defigned to prove. It is by this deception that the au- thors of two rival doctrines arrive at oppofite conclu- fions by fads diredly oppofed to each other. Du Hamel believed, that as the bark formed the wood of a tree, adding, by a fort of fecretion, fucceflive layers to its growth; fo the periofteum formed the bone at the firft, renewed it when fpoiled or cut away, and, when broken, alfumed the nature of bone, and repaired the breach. He broke the bones of pigeons, and, allow- ing them to heal, he found the periofteum to be the chief organ for producing bone. He found that the callus had no adhefion to the broken bone, and was ea- fily feparated from the broken ends which remained rough and bare. And, in purfuing thefe difledions, he found the periofteum fairly glued to the external fur- 7 face

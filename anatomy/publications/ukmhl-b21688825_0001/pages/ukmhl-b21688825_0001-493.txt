Thefe burfe, I am perfuaded, are often the feat of difeafe, when it is judged to be in the joint itfelf. But the truth is very eafily known ; for if a fwelling appear under the patella, projecting at the fides, and railing the patella from the other bones, we are fure that it muft be in the main cavity of the joint : but if fwel'lings appear above and below the patella, then there is reafon to believe that thefe belong to the great burfe, which are placed above and below the patella: a complaint which is far lefs formidable than a fwelling of the joint itfelf; I would almoft fay eafily cured; for openings into thefe burfe, though they Ihould be avoided, are lefs dangerous than openings into the joint. It is from miftaking fuch tumours for collections in the capfule itfelf, that authors fpeak of openings into the joint as a familiar or eafy thing, or think that they have done fuch operations fafely when probably they were punCturing the burfe only. Thefe burfe mucofe lie under the tendon of the ex- tenfor mufcles, and under the ligament of the patella: they are of the fame fubftance with the capfule of the joint itfebf; . they lie over the capfule, united to it by cellular fubftance, and the bundles of fat, which ' are difpofed irregularly about the joint, belong partly to the burfe and partly to the capfule; one end pro- jecting into the cavity of the burfe, while the other end of the fame fatty bundles projects into the cavity pf the joint. yon.

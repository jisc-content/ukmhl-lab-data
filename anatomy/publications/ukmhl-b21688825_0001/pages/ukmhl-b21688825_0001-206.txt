BONES OF THE i.6i V tarfa! and metatarfal bones. There is a large fcabrottS point on which we (land ; which is rough, for the in- fertion of the great Achillis tendon, the rope by which the mufcles of the bran act. The roughnefs of the heel-bone gives the tendon a firm hold, and its projec- tion backwards gives it the power of a very long lever. The points to be obferved are, i .

An irre- gular articular furface, or rather two furfaces covered with cartilage, by which it is joined with the aftraga- lus. 3. Another articulating furface by which it is joined with the os cuboides. And, 4. A fort of arch downwards, under which the veffels and nerves and the tendons alfo pafs on fafely into the foie of the foot. 5. Naviculare is named os naviculare, or os scaphoides, from a fanciful refembiance to a boat. But this is a name of which anatomifts have been pe- culiarly fond, and which they have ufed with very little difcretion or referve : the ftudent will hardly find any fuch refembiance: it is rather like the dies with which we play at drafts 5 that It; a flattened cir- cular body, with its borders rifing up a little ; and each flat fide forms an articulating furface. That concave fide which looks backwards, is pretty deep, and receives the head of the aflragalus : that flat fide which looks forwards, has not fo deep a focket, but receives the three cuneiform bones upon a furface ra- ther plain and irregular.

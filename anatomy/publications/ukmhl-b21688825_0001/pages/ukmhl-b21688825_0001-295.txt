\ MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 251 longus, the extenfor brevis, and the brachialis exter- nus; but it is, in faCt, one three-headed mufcle. The longeft head of this mufcle is in the middle. It arifes by a flat tendon of one inch in thicknefs, from the edge of the fcapula under the neck, and a little way from the origin of the long head of the biceps ; and it is under this head that the tendon of the teres major pafles to its infertion. The fecond head is on the outfide of the arm, next in length to this. It arifes from the arm-bone under the great tuber, and juft below the infertion of the te- res minor. Thefe two meet about the middle of the humerus. The third, or internal head, is the Ihorteft of all. It begins at the inner fide of the humerus, juft under the infertion of the teres major ; and it arifes from the in- ner part of the humerus, all the way down, and joins juft where the fecond head joins (i. e. about the mid- dle.) All thefe heads ftill continue adhering to the humerus (as the brachialis does on the fore fide), quite down to within an inch of the joint; and then a ftrong thick tendon is formed, by which it is implanted ftrongly in the projecting heel of the ulna, named ole- cranon ; by which projection it has great power, and the power is increafed by an increafed length in dogs, and other animals which run or bound. The whole forms a very thick and powerful mufcle, which covers and embraces all the back part of the arm ; and its ufe is too Ample to admit of any farther explanation, than juft to fay that it extends the hinge- joint of the elbow with great power ; and that by its long

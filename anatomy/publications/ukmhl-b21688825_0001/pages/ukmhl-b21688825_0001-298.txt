254 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. purpofe, that when the fore-arm is to ftrike, or the hand to grafp, the biceps firft moves, and by making the fafcia tenfe, prepares the fore-arm for thofe vio- lent actions which are to enfue. Thus, it may be defined a web of thin but ftrong tendon, which covers all the mufcles of the fore-arm; makes the furface before difle&ion firm and fmooth; fends down par- titions, which are fixed into the ridges of the radius and ulna, enabling thofe bones to give a broader origin to the mufcles, eftablifihing a ftrong connexion among the feveral layers, and making the difle&ion always difficult, and never fair nor clean. The motions to be performed by the mufcles which iie upon the fore arm are thefe three ; to roll the hand ; to bend the wrift ; to bend the fingers. i. The turning of the hand, which is performed by rolling the radius on the ulna, is named pronation and fupination. When we turn the palm down, it is faid to be prone; when we turn the palm upwards, it is fupine. This is pronation and fupination. The muf- cles which perform thefe motions are the pronators and the supinators ; and the motion itfelfis beft ex- * emplified in the turning of a key in a lock, or in the guards of fencing, which are formed by a continual play of the radius upon the ulna, carrying the wrift round in circles. 2. The wrift is called the carpus, and therefore thofe mufcles which ferve for bending or extending the wrift are the flexors and extensors of the carpus. 3. The bending and extending of the fingers cannot be miftaken j and therefore the flexors and extenfors of the fingers need not be explained. 14 Thefe

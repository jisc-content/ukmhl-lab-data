Individual bones of the skull. 77 fmall neat cells^ much like a honey comb, and regu- larly arranged in two rows, parted from each other by a thin partition ; fo that the os planum feems to have one fet of cells attached to it, while another regular fet of cells belongs in like manner to the fpongy bones. The cells are thus twelve in number *, opening into each other, and into the nofe. Thefe cells are frequently the feat of venereal ulcers, and the fpungy bones are the furface where polypi often fprout up. And from the general connexions and forms of the bone, we can eafily underhand how the venereal ulcer, when deep in the nofe, having got to thefe cells, cannot be cured, but undermines all the face ; how the venereal difeafe, having affected the nofe, foon fpreads to the eye, and how even the brain itfelf is not fafe. We fee the danger of a blow upon, the nofe, which, by a force upon the feptum, or middle partition, may aeprefs the delicate cribriform plate, fo as to opprefs the brain with all the effeXs of a frac- tured lkull, and without any operation v/hich can give relief. And we alfo fee much danger in pulling away polypi, which are firmly attached to the upper fpongy bone. SPHENOIDAL BONE.â€” The fphenoidal bone completes the cranium, and clofes it below. It is named sphenoid, cuneiform, or wedge-like bone, from its being incafed in the very bafis of the fkull; or it is named os multiform e, from its irregular lhape. Lis' much of the lhape of a bat, whence it is often named the. pterygoid bone, its temporal proceffes being like extended wings ; its pterygoid proceffes like feet; its * The number is commonly twelve, but not regularly fo. middle

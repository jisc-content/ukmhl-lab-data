Neither were they intended as drains ; for furely it is a bold pofition to affume, that nature has carefully provided for our making iffues upon the futures. When the original opennefs of the head and the membrane- ous condition of the futures were iirft obferved, it was thought to be an obfervation of no final 1 importance. The ancients believed that the membranes of the brain came out by the futures, to form the pericrani- um, and going from that over the feveral joints, formed the periodeum for all the bones. Theyfaw a clofe connection betwixt the external and internal mem- branes of the fkull ; and they thought that nature had intended there a freer communication, and an occa- fional drain. They found the futifres particularly wide and membranous in a child, which they attri- buted to the watery date of its brain, requiring a freer outlet than in the adult; and accordingly they named the opening of the childâ€™s head the bregma, fons, fonta- nelle, the fountain, by which they believed there was a continual exudation of moidure from the brain. We might have expeded thefe notions to have va- nilhed with the dodrines of humours and revulfion which gave rife to them ; but both the dodrines, and the pradice, have been revived of late years ; and a furgeon of fome eminence has been at pains to exa- mine various fkulls, trying to find which of ail the fu- tures remains longed open, and which fhould form the readied and fured drain ; and after a curious exa- mination of each, he decidedly condemns the fonta- Jielle 5 finds the additamentum of the fquamous future 9 always

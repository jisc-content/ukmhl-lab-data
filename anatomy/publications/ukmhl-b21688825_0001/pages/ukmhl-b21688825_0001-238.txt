194 MUSCLES OF THE oculi, where thefe two touch each other, that it is doubtful to which of thofe greater mufcles this little one might be moll properly referred. So this flip of oblique fibres, rifing from the inner angle of the eye, and being fixed into the eyebrow, alfo antagonizes the occipito-frontalis ; and drawing the eyebrows together, and wrinkling the fpace betwixt them, is very rightly named corrugator supercilii. III. Orbicularis oculi, or palpebrarum, is a neat and regular mufcle, furrounding the eye, and co- vering the eyelids in a circular form. It is exceedingly flat and thin ; is about an inch in breadth j lies imme- diately under the lkin of the eyelids; and is imme- diately attached to them, and but little connected with the bone. It has one fmall tendon in the inner corner of the eye, which is both its origin and infertion j for it begins and ends in it. This fmall tendon is eafily felt through the lkin in the inner corner of the eye. It arifes by a little white knot from the nafal procefs of the upper jaw-bone. Its fibres immediately become muf- cular, and fpread out thin over the upper eyelid. They pafs over it to the outer corner of the eye, where they crols a little, and having covered juft the edge of the temple with their thin expanded fibres, they return in a circular form round by the lower eyelid to the point from whence they had fet out. This is, in all its courfe, a very thin mufcular expanfion, with regular orbicular fibres. It is rather a little broader over the lower eyelid ; extends itfelf a little upon the face be- yond the brim of the focket, both at the temple and upon the cheek; and its fibres crofs each other a lit- tle at the outer angle j fo that fome, underftanding this

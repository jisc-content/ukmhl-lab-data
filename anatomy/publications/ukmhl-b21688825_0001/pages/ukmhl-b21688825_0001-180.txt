How necefiary it is to mark this point, may be eafxly deduced, from knowing that it is under the arch of this femoral ligament that the great artery paf- fes down to the thigh, and that the femoral hernia is formed. The lower anterior fpinous procefs is a fmall bump, or little fwelling, about an inch under the firft one, which gives rife to the rectus femoris mufcle, or ftraight mufcle of the thigh, which lies along ics fore part. The back, or dorsum of the os ilium, is covered with the two great glutssi mufcles ; and the costa, as it is abfurdly called, or the inner concave furface, gives rife to the internal iliac mufcle. This bone (the os ilium) has a broad rough furface, by which it is connected with the os facrum at its fide ; the very form of which declares the nature of this join- ing, and is fufficient argument and proof that the joinings of the pelvis do not move. The acute line which is named linea innomi- nata, is feen upon the internal furface of the bone, dividing the ala, or wing, from that part which is in the focket for the thigh. This line compofes part of the brim of the pelvis ; diftinguifhes the cavity of the pelvis from the cavity of the abdomen ; and marks the circle into which the head of the child defcends at the commencement of labour. The os ischium, or hip-bone, is placed perpendicu- larly under the os ilium, and is the lowefl point of the pelvis, upon which we fit. It forms the largeft fhare of

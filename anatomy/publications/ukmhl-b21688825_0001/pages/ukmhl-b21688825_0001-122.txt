7$ DESCRIPTION OF THE middle like the body and head of a bat. Its wing-like precedes are in the hollow of the temple, forming a part of the fquamous future, and alfo compofing a part of the orbit of the eye : Its pterygoid procelfes hang over the roof of the mouth, forming the back of the noftrils. The body is in the very centre of the fkull and tranfmits almoft all the nerves of the brain ; but flill the body bears fo fmall a proportion to the bone, that we have not a regular centre to which all the procTTes can be referred ; fo that we are always, in deferibing this bone, moving forwards from point to point, from one procefs or hole to the next. PROCESSES.â€”i. The alje, or wings, often named temporal proceffes, rife up in the temple, to form part of the hollow of the temple ; and thefe wings of the fphenoid bone meeting the frontal, parietal, and temporal bones, by a thin fcaly edge, they make part of the fquamous future, and give a fmooth furface for the temporal mufcle to play upon. 2. The other fide of this fame procefs looks towards the focket of the eye, and has a very regular and fmooth furface ; it is exaftly oppofite to the os pla- num. As the aethmoid bone forms part of the infide of the orbit, the wing of the fphenoid bone forms part of the outnde of the orbit; and fo the furface turned towards the eye is named the qp*bitary process of the fphasnoid bone. 3. The lower, or back part of this bone runs out into a narrow point, -which fmks in under the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and being lharp pointed, it is named the spinous process. It is very remarkable for

DESCRIPTION OF THE 73 that the carotid makes the form of an Italic S, when it is palling through the fubflance of the bone ; and in place of a mere hole, we find a fort of Ihort canal,, wide, a little crooked, and very fmooth within. There feems to be a particular defign in this angle, which the artery is forced to make : perhaps it is defigned to abate the violence with which the blood would drive forwards into the brain ; for in many of the lower ani- mals, there are ftill more particular provifions than this, the artery being prevented from entering the brain in one great trunk, by a curious divifion, into many branches, which meet again. It is at this par- ticular point that we are fenfible in our own body of the beating of thefe two great arteries; and Haller is at pains to inform us, that, during a fever, he felt this beating in a very diftrefling degree. 2. The great lateral sinus comes out through the temporal bone, to 'brm the internal jugular vein. The courfe of the finus may be eafily traced by the groove of the occipital bone downwards, behind the pars petrofa: there alfo it makes a deep groove, and ends with a large inteftine-like turn, which makes a large cavity in the temporal bone, big enough to re- ceive the point of the finger. The finus palfes out, not by any particular hole in the temporal bone, but by what is called a common hole, viz. formed one half by the temporal, and one half by the occipital bone. This hole is very large; is lacerated or ragged like. It; * is fometimes divided into two openings, by a fmall point, or fpine of bone. The larger opening on one fide of that point tranfmits the great finus, where it begins to form the jugular vein ; and the fmaller open- ing

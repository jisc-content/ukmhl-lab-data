OF THE TRUNK. I!5 i 2 and outer margin rifes upwards; and the fore end of each oval is turned a little towards its fellow. Now, by the obliquity of the condyles, and this obliquity of the fockets which receive them, all rotatory motion is prevented ; and the head performs, by its articula- tions with the firft vertebra or atlas, only the nodding motions; and when it rolls, it carries the firft vertebra along with it, moving round the tooth-like procefs of the dentatus. The articulation with the head is a hinge joint in the ftridtefl fenfe : it allows of no other motion than that backwards and forwards. The nod- ding motions are performed by the head upon the atlas; the rotatory motions are performed by the at- las moving along with the head, turning upon the took-like procefs of the dentatus. Now the upper articulating furface of the atlas is hollowed to fecure the articulation with the head; but the lower articulation, that with the dentatus, be- ing fecured already by the tooth-like procefs of that bone, no other property is required in the lower ar- ticulating furface of the atlas, than that it Ihould glide with perfedl eafe: for which purpofe it is plain and fmooth; it neither receives, nor is received into the dentatus by any hollow, but lies flat upon the furface of that bone. It is alfo evident, that fmce the office of the atlas is to turn along with the head, it could not be fixed to the dentatus, in the common way, by a body and by intervertebral fubflance : and fmce the atlas attached to the head moves along with it, turning as upon an axis, it mull have no spi- nous process ; for the projedlion of a fpinous procefs muff have prevented its turning upon the dentatus,

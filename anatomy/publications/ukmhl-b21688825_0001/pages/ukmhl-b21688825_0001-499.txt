THIGH, LEG, AND ANKLE. 455 in all the joints. It is ftronger than the other joints ; it can hardly be luxated without a laceration of its ligaments, and breaking of the bones which guard it at either fide ; and it is the great violence which is required for completing this diflocation, and the ter- rible complication of diflocation, fracture, and lacera- tion of the (kin, which makes this accident fo dangerous beyond any other luxation. The ASTRAGALUS, OS CALOIS, OS NAVICULARE, and all the bones of the tarfus, are united to each other by large heads and diftinct and peculiar joints ; befides which, the bones are crofs tied to one another by li- gaments fo numerous and complicated that they can- not nor need not be explained. They pafs acrofs from bone to bone in an infinite variety of directions ; feme longitudinal; fome tranfverfe; and fome oblique. There is a curious complication, which we may call a web of ligaments, covering either fide of the foot with fliining and ftar-iike bundles : each bone has its cap- fular ligaments for joining it to the next; each joint of each bone has its articulating cartilages always frefh and lubricated; each joint has, befides its capfule, ftrips of oblique, longitudinal, and tranfverfe ligaments, joining it to the neared bones ; and the greater bones have larger and more important ligaments, as from the aftragalus to the os calc's, front the os calcis to the os naviculare, and from that again to the fcaphoid bone, &c. The metatarfal bones have their capfular ligaments joining them to the tarfal bones, and they have hgaÂ® ments ftrengthening their capfules, and tying them more ilrongly to the tarfal bones j and, as in the meta- i carpal

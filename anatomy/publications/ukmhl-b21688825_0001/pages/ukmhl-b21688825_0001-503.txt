THIGH, LEG, AND ARM. 459 formed, and another joint by which it rolls, has the two great endowments, fo rarely combined in any joint of the freed motion, and of great drength ; fo alfo has the head, by the combination of two joints of op- pofite ufes and forms ; for its own condyles play like a mere hinge upon the atlas; and the axis of the dentatus fecures all the properties of a circular joint : this combination gives it all the motions of either joint without their peculiar defedts. But there is dill a third order of joints, which have fuch an ob- fcure and fhuffling motion that it cannot be obferved. The carpus and metacarpus, the tarsus and me- tatarsus, the tibia with the fibula, have thefe fhuffling and almod immoveable joints \ they are not intended for much motion among themfelves, but are appointed by a diffufed and gradual yielding to facili- tate the motions of other joints.

12 OF THE FORMATION the feeretion of femen, of faliva, of bile, or of urine. Thus the body is furnifhed with various apparatus for performing various offices, and for repairing the wafte, Thefe are the fecretions, and the formation of bone is one of thefe. The plan of the whole body lies in the embryo, in perfect order, with all its forms and parts. Cartilage is laid in the place of bone, and preferves its form for the future bone, with all its apparatus of furrounding membranes, its heads, its proceffes, and its conneftion with the foft parts. The colourlefs ar- teries of this pellucid, but organized mafs of cartilage keep up its growth ; extend, and yet preferve its form; and gradually enlarging in their own diameter, at laft receive the entire blood. Then the depofition of earthy matter begins. The bone is depofited in fpecks, which fpread and meet, and form themfelves into per- fect bone. While the bone is laid by arteries, the cartilage is Conveyed away by the abforbing velfels ; and while they convey away the fuperfluous cartilage, they model the bone into its due form; ffiape out its cavities, cancelli, and holes ; remove the thinner parts of the cartilage, and harden it into due confidence. If fuch organization of arteries to depofite bone, and of abforbents to take up the cartilage and make room for the offeous matter, be neceffary in the formation and growth, it is no lefs neceffary for the life and health of the full formed bone. Its health depends on the regular depofition and reabforption, moulding and forming the parts; and by various degrees of adtion, bone is liable to inflame, to ulcerate, to rot and fpoil, to become brittle by too much fecreted earth, or to become foft by a gree^ dy difeafed abforption of its earthy parts.

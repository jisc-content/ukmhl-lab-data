i6B BONES OF THE by one of which the fhoulder bone is moved upon the fcapula, while by the other the fcapula itfelf is moved upon the ribs. The mufcle lying in the hollow of the fcapula marks it v/ith many fmooth hollows and wave- like rifings, which are merely the marks of the origin of its mufcles, but which were miflaken even by the great Vefalius for the impreflions of the ribs. 2. The outer flat furface is like the inner one, but that it is traverfed by the spine, which is a very acute and high ridge of bone. Now the fpine, thus travers- ing the bone from behind forwards, divides its outer furface into two unequal parts, of which the part above the fpine is fmaller, and that below the fpine is larger. Each of thefe fpaces has its name, one fupra fpinatus, and the other infra fpinatus; and each of them lodges a mufcle, named, the one the mufculus fupra-fpinatus fcapulae, as being above the fpine; the other, muf- culus infra-fpinatus fcapulae, as being below the fpine. A third mufcle is named fubfcapularis, as lying urn der the fhoulder blade, upon that concave furface which is towards the ribs ; fo that the whole fcapula is covered with broad flat mufcles, whofe offices are to move the fhoulder bone in various directions, and which imprefs the fcapula with gentle rifings and hollows on its outer as well as on its inner furface. 3. The triangular form of the fcapula muff be next obferved. The upper line of the triangle is the fhorteft; it is named the costa or border. This fupe- rior cofta of the fcapula receives thofe ftrong and flat mufcles that raife the fhoulder upwards. The lower border, which iÂ§ named the costa inferior, or the . . lowes?

SI4 OF THE fRUN&. more than a fimple ring; it has no fpinous procefs j and its tranfverfe procefs is not forked. The body is entirely awanting : in its place, the vertebra has a fiat furface looking backwards, which is fmooth and po- Iifhed by the rolling of the tooth-like procefs -y there is alfo a fharp point rifing perpendicularly upwards towards the occipital bone, and this point is held to the edge of the occipital hole by a ftrong ligament. The fmooth mark of the tooth-like procefs is eafily found y and upon either fide of it there proje&s a fmall point from the inner circle of the ring. Thefe two points have a ligament extended betwixt them, called the tranfverfe ligament; which like a bridge, divides the ring into two openings ; one, the fmaller, for lodging the tooth-like procefs, embracing it clofely ; the greater opening is for the fpinal marrow : The ligament con- fines the tooth-like procefs; and when the ligament is burft by violence (as has happened), the tooth-like procefs, broken loofe, preffes upon the fpinal marrow; the head, no longer fupported by it, falls forward, and the patient dies. The articulating process may be confidered as the body of this vertebra; for it is at once the only thick part, and the only articulating furface. This broad articulating fubftance is in the middle of each fide of the ring : it has two fmooth .furfaces on each fide, one look- ing upwards, by which it is joined to the occiput; and one looking dire&ly downwards, by which is is joined to the fecond vertebra of the neck. The two upper articulating furfaces are oval, and flightly hollow to re* ceive the occipital condyles *. they are alfo oblique, for the inner margin of each dips downwards: the outer

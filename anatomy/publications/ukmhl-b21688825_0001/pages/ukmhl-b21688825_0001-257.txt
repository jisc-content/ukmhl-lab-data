LOWER JAW, THROAT, AND TONGUE. 2IJ p 3 the The os hyoides is a fmall bone refembling, in fnape at lead,- the jaw-bone. It has a middle thicker part, named its bahs, which is eafily felt outwardly ; it cor- refponds in placAwith the chin, and is diftinguifhed about an inch below the chin ; the uppermoft of the hard points which are felt in the forepart of the throat. Next, it has two long horn-like proceifes, which go backwards along the fides of the throat, called the cornua, or horns of the os hyoides ; and which are tied by a long ligament, which comes down from the ftyloid procefs of the temporal bone. And, laflly. It has fmall cartilaginous pieces or joinings, by which, the horns are united to the bans ; and often m the adult this joining is converted into bone.-At this point where the two horns go backwards, like the legs of the letter V, there- are commonly at the griftly part of the os hyoides two fmall perpendicular proceifes which Hand up from the joining of the horns to the body; and thefe are named the appendices of the os hyoides or the lefl'er cornua. Now this os hyoides forms by its bafis the root of the tongue ; thence it is often named the bone of the tongue. It forms at the fame time the upper part of the trachea, or windpipe ; and it carries upon it that cartilage named epiglottis, which, like a valve, pre- vents any thing getting down into the windpipe. Its horns extend along the fjdes of the throat, 'keeping the openings of the windpipe and gullet extended as we would keep a bag extended by two fingers. The chief mufcles of the tongue and of the windpipe arife from its body ; the chief mufcles of the gullet arife from its horns, and efpecialiy from their points ; it receives

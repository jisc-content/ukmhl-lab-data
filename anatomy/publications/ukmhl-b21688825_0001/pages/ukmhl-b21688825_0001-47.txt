5 AND GROWTH OF BONES. face of the new bone; or he found rather the callus or regenerated bone to be but a mere thickening of the periofteum, its layers being feparated, and its fub- ftance fwelled. On the firft days he found the peri- ofteum thickened, inflamed, and eaftly divided into many lamellae, or plates ; but while the periofteum was fuffering thefe changes, the bone was in no degree changed. On the following days, he found the tu- mor of the periofteum increafed at the place of the fradture, and extending further along the bone; its in- ternal furface already cartilaginous, and always tinged with a little blood, which came to it through the vef- fels of the marrow. He found the tumor of the peri- ofteum fpongy, and divifible into regular layers, while {till the ends of the bone were unchanged, or only a little roughened by the firft layer of the periofteum be- ing already converted into earth and depofited upon the furface of the bone: and in the next ftage of its progrefs, he found the periofteum firmly attached to the furface of the callous mafs. By wounding, not breaking, the bones, he had ftill a more flattering ap- pearance of a proof; for having pierced them with holes, he found the holes filled up with a fort of tom- pion, proceeding from the periofteum, which was thickened all round them. In an early ftage, this plug could, by drawing the periofteum, be pulled out from its hole :* In a more advanced ftage, it was infe- parably united to the bone, fo as to fupply the lofs. Haller, doubting whether the periofteum, a thin and delicate membrane, could form fo large a mafs of bone or callus, repeated the proofs; and he again found cpiite the reverfe of all this : That the callus, or the orb Â£ 3 gina^

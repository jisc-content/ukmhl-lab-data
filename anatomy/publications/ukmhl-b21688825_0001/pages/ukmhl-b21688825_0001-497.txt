T.ilGH, LEG, AND ANKLE. 453 whfle the ftrong lateral ligaments of the knee guard it fo that it cannot be diflocated till they are torn, the lower heads of the tibâ€™a and fibula fo guard the foot that it cannot be luxated fidewife without fuch violence as breaks thefe bones : Find, the fibula is fo conne&ed with the tibia at its lower end, that they form together one cavity for receiving the aftragulus, with two proj effing points; the fibula forming the outer ankle, and the tibia forming the procefs of the inner ankle ; the joining of the fibula to the tibia here, is like that of its upper end, too clofe to admit of the finalleft motion ; and it is thoroughly fecured by particular ligaments ; one of which palling from the fibula to the tibia on the fore part, is named the liga- mentum superius anticum, confifling in general of one or two diftinfl flat bands. Another more continu- ed and broader ligamentous membrane goes from the fibula to the tibia acrofs the back part, and is named LIGAMENTUM FOSTICUM SUPERIUS ; the LIGAMEN- tum posticum inferius being but a flip of the fame. Next comes the capfule of the joint, which joins the aftragalus to the lower heads of the tibia and the fibula ; it is thinner both before and behind than v/e fhould expect from the flrength of a joint which bears all the weight and the moft violent motions cf the body. But, in faft, the capfule everywhere ferves other pur- pofes than giving ftrength to the joint, and never is ftrong except by additional ligaments from without; fo it is with the angle-joint, the capfule of which is ex- ceedingly thin before, but it is ftrengthened at the back part, and efpecially at the fides, by fupplementary ligaments: Fir ft, a ftrong ligament comes down from g g 3 the

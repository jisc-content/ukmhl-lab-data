AND GROWTH OF BONES. 29 tions of the mufcles, tendons, or other parts which run over it. The office of the periofleum is not to generate bone ; and therefore it adheres but flightly to the grow- ing bone: it is to nourifh the external plates ; and therefore as the bone grows, and as the external plates are further removed from the medullary veffels, the adhefion of the periofleum becomes clofer, its arteries are enlarged, and the dependence of the outer layers on the periofleum is as well proved as the dependence of the body T>f the bone upon its medullary artery 5 for as piercing the medulla kills the whole bone, hurting the periofleum kills the outer layers of the bone. Any accident which robs the bone of its pe- riofleum has this effeft; accidental wounds of the periofleum, deep ulcers of the foft parts, as on the fhin, the beating of aneurifms, the growth of tumors, the preffure even of any external body, will, by hurting the periofleum, caufe exfoliation, which is, in plain terms, the death of the external layer, by the injury of the outward veffels; and an active inflammation of the deeper layers, which being fully nourifhed by the in- ternal arteries, inflame, fwell, become porous and fpon- gy, form granulations, and thefe granulations pufh off the mortified plate, and form themfelves into new bone, which fupplies its place. The cartilages are alfo part of the living fyflem of the bone : and we fee too well, in the queflion of the bones themfelves, how unphilofophical it mull be, to deny organization and feeling to any part of the living body, however dead or infulated it may appear; for every part has its degree of life : the eye, the fkin, the fleffi, the tendons, and the bones, have fucceffive de- grees

AND GROWTH OF BONES. 25 and off, whilft another is entire, and found. Malpighi had firft obferved the lamellated ftru&ure of bones, likening them to the leaves of a book. Gagliardi, who, like Hippocrates, went among the burial places of the city, to obferve the bones there, found in a tomb, where the bones had been long expofed, a fkull, the os frontis of which he could difledt into many layers, with the point of a pin. He afterwards found various bones, from all parts of the body, thus decompofed j and he added to the do&rine of plates, that they were held to- gether by minute procefles, which going from plate to plate, performed the offices of nails : Thefe appeared to his imagination to be of four kinds, ftraight and inclined nails, crooked or hook-like, and fome with fmall round heads, of the form of bolts or pins *. Another notable difcovery, was the ufe of the holes which are very eafily feen through the fubftance of bones, and among their plates. They are, indeed, no more than the channels by which the veffels pafs into the bones ; but the older anatomifts imagined them to be Hill more important, allowing the marrow to tranfude through all the fubftance of the bone, and keep it foft. Now this notion, of lubricating the earthy parts of a bone, like the common talk about fomentations to the internal parts of the body, is very mechanical, and very ignorant; for the internal parts of the body, are both hot and moift of themfelves, and neither heat nor moif- ture can reach them from without: the bone is al- ready fully watered with arteries ; it is moift in itfelf, * Thefe nails, which Gagliardi imagined, were no more than the little irregularities, rilings, and hollows of the adjoining plates, by which they are connedled,

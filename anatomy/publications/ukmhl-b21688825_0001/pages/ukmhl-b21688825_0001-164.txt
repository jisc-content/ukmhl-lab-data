120 OF THE TRUNK, We are now qualified to underftand the motions of the vertebrae, and to trace the degree of motion in, each individual clafs. The degrees of motion vary with the forms of the vertebra in each part of the fpine: the motion is freeft in the neck; more limited in the loins; and in the back (the middle part of the fpine) fcarcely any motion is allowed. The head per- forms all the nodding motions upon the firft vertebra of the neck: the firfl; vertebra of the neck performs again all the quick and Ihort turnings of the head; by moving upon the dentatus: all the lower vertebras of the neck are alfo tolerably free, and favour thefe mo- tions by a degree of turning ; and all the bendings of the neck are performed by them. The dorfal vertebrae are the moil limited in their movements; bending chiefly forwards by the yielding of their intervertebral fubllance. The vertebrae of the loins again move largely, for their intervertebral fubllance is deep, and their proceffes quite unentangled and free. To per- form thefe motions, each vertebra has two dillinct joints, as different in office as in form: firll, each vertebra is fixed to thofe above and below by the in- tervertebral fubllance, which adheres fo to each that there is no true motion: there is no turning of any one vertebra upon the next; but the elallicity of the intervertebral fubllance allows the bones to move a little, fo that there is a general twilling and gentle bending of the whole fpine. The fecond joint is of the common nature with the other joints of the body, for the articulating proceffes are faced with cartilage, furrounded with a capfule, and lubricated with a mucus. And I conceive this to be the intention of the

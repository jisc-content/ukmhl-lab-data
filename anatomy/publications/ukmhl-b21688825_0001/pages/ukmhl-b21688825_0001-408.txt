364 MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. gastrocnemius iNTERNUs. This, like the lafl muf- cle, has two heads, which arife from either bone. One head arifes from the bulb of the fibula, and continues to adhere to one fourth of the upper part of the bone ; another head arifes from about three inches of the upper part of the tibia. The firft of thefe heads is large and round; the fecond is fmaller and round ; they unite immediately; and a large fiefhy belly is formed, with flill a confpicuous divifion be- twixt the flefh of the two heads. The great tendon begins about half way down the leg, but ftill is inter- mixed with fiefhy fibres till it approach the heel. A little below the middle of the leg this tendon is united with the tendon of the gaflrocnemius, to form the great back tendon, named tendo Achillis, and fome- times, though very rarely, chorda magna. The tendon is large ; it grows fmail as it approach- es the heel; when it touches the extremity of the heel bone, it expands to take a firmer hold. In running, walking, leaping, &c. this mufcle, with the extenfors of the leg, are the great mufcles. The external gafcrocnemius has double power; for it, ari- ling from the tubercles of the thigh-bone, is both an extenfor of the foot and a flexor of the leg; but the gaflrocnemius internus is a mere extenfor of the foot, and both together have fuch flrength as often to break the tendo Achillis. CLXXXIII, Plantaris.-â€”rThis mufcle is named from a miflaken notion of its going to the planta pe- d's or foie of the foot, to form the plantar aponeuro- fis, like the palmaris of the hand; but, in fadt it does 1 not

AND GROWTH OF BONES. II From that centre they extend in a radiated form to- wards either end, and the fibres of the bone are radiated in the fame direction; there are furrows betwixt the rays, and the arteries run along in the furrows of the bone, as if the arteries were forming thefe ridges, fe- creting and pouring out the bony matter, each artery- piling it up on either fide to form its ridge. The bo- dy of the bone is fupplied by its own veffels; the heads of the bone are fupplied by the extremities of the fame trunks which perforate the dividing cartilage like a fieve; the periofteum adhering more firmly to the heads of the bone, it brings affiftant arteries from without, which meet the internal trunks, and affifl th e ofilfication; but with every help, the ofilfication js not accomplifhed in many years. It is by the adtion of the veffels that all the parts of the human body are formed; fluids and folids, each for its refpedtive ufe. The blood is formed by the addon of the veffels, and all the fluids are in their turn formed from the blood. We fee in the chick, where there is no external fource from which its red blood can be derived, that red blood is formed within its own fyf- tem. Every animal fyflem, as it grows, aflimilates its food, and converts it to the animal nature, and fo increafes the quantity of its red blood : And as the red blood is thus prepared by the addons of the greater fyftem, the adtions of particular veffels prepare various parts: fome to be added to the mafs of folids, for the natural growth; others to fupply the continual wafle; others to be difcharged from the body as effete, and hurtful, or to allow new matter to be received ; others again to perform certain offices within the body, as the

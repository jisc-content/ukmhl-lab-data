JOINTS OF THE 4 34 ftrong at its fades, yet tendinous and ligamentous fibres crofs it in all directions ; fo that the capfule, and its alii fling ligaments, are irregular and rough without 5 but gelatinous, fmooth, and glofly within. WRIST. The wrist is one of the mofl moveable joints in the body, having the ftrength of a mere hinge-joint (becaufe it is almofl a Uriel hinge, by the connection of the long ball of the carpus with the long hollow of the radius); and having, at the fame time, all the pro- perties of the moft moveable joint, by the free turn- ing of the radius, without the weaknefs which is pecu- liar to the circular and free moving joints. Th'efe dif- tinCtions divide the wrifl-joint into its two parts. 1. The articulation formed by the feaphoid and lu- nated bones, which form an oval ball of articulation, and the great feaphoid cavity of the radius which re- ceives this ball. The end of the ulna does not proper- ly enter into the cavity of the wriil, but its end, or little round head, is covered with a moveable carti- lage, and that cartilage reprefents the end of the ul- na. Now this firft joint, viz. of the feaphoid and lunated bones, the head of the radius, and the move- able cartilage which reprefents the head of the ulna, are furrounded by the general capfule or bag of the joint. The capfule arifes from the ends of the radius and of the ulna ; from the ftyloid point of the one round to the fame po'nt of the other; and is implant- ed near the lower rank of the carpal bones. Though it adheres firft to the feaphoid and lunated bones, it paffes them, going over all the bones of the carpus, 4 efpecially

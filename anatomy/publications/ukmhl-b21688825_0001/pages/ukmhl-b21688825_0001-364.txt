320 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN, Is oblique, and looking towards the pubis, like thd fibres which form it, and confifts of two legs or pillars of the ring, as they are called; for the upper flip, which forms the upper part of the opening, goes dire&ly to- wards the crell or higheft point of the pubis ; the lower pillar, or the flip which forms the lower line of the flit* turns it behind, gets under the upper one, and is im- planted into the pubis, within and behind the upper pillar: this lower flip forms at once the lowrer pillar of the ring and the edge of the femoral ligaments Now this eroding of the pillars of the ring fecures it; for the more the mufcle pulls in prefling upon the ab- dominal vifeera, the tighter is the flit drawn ; and the obliquity of the opening gives the direction to hernias of the groin, which always point towards the pubis, fo as to fall into the ferotum in men, or into the labia pU- dendi in women, keeping clofe by the groin* The fpermatic cord, formed of the veflels belongs ing to the tefbicle, pafles through this ring of the ex- ternal oblique mufcle ; but as the internal, oblique,- and tranfverfe mufcles, form no fhare in the ring, the cord pafles by their lower edge, but not through it. At the place where the cord pafles the edge of the in- ternal oblique mufcle, it fends a bundle of flefliy fibres down along the cord, which go all along the cord, gra- dually extend towards the tefticle, expanding and grow- ing thin upon the upper end of the tefticle, and gra- dually difappearing on its body. This is CXLVIII. The cremaster muscle of the tes- ticle, which is a thin flip of fibres from the internal oblique mufcle of the abdomen; which is defigned for fufpending the tefticle, and for drawing it up ; is very

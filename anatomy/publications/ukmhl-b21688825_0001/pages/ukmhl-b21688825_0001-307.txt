MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 263 in proportion to the number of joints that a mufcle pafles over, its offices rauft be more numerous; for this one not only moves the fingers on the metacarpus, but the hand upon the wrift, and even the fore-arm upon the arm. LXXXVIII. The flexor digitorum profundus vel perforans, has the fame origin, infertion, and ufe, infomuch that the defcription of the laft is applicable to this mufcle in almoft every point. This is of a low- er ftratum of mufcles; it lies deeper, and under the for- mer, whence its name: and by this deeper fituation it is excluded from any hold upon the tubercle of the humerus, It arifes from the ulna, along its internal furface; from the whole furface of the interofieous ligament; and alfo in fome degree from the intermufcular mem- brane, which feparates this from the fublimis. This mufcle is fmall, we may fay compreffed, above \ but it grows pretty ftrong and fleffiy near the middle of the arm; it divides above the middle of the arm into four portions, correfponding with the four fingers ; and it is about the middle of the arm that the tendons begin, and continue to receive mufcular fibres from behind, all down to the ligament of the wrift. At the wrift thefe tendons are tied to each other, and to the tendons of the fublimis, by loofe tendinous and cellular fibres. They diverge from each other, after palling under the annular ligament; and going along in the hollow of the bones, under the tendons of the fublimis, they nrft pafs through the bridges formed by the palmar aponeurofis, then enter the fheaths of the fingers, and finally pafs through the perforations of s 4 ' tfie

102 OF THE BONES 5. The condyloid process, or the articulating pro- cefs of the jaw, is behind this, and is formed by the body of the bone turned up at its angle. This alfo is of the fame flat form with the reft of the jaw. The condyle, or joint of the jaw-bone, is placed upon the top of this rifing branch. The condyle, or articulating head, is not round, but flat, of a long form, and fet acrofs the branch of the jaw. This articulating pro- cefs is received into a long hollow of the temporal bone, juft under the root of the zygomatic procefs; fo that by the long form of the condyles, and of the ca- vity into which it is received, this joint is a mere hinge, not admitting of lateral nor rotatory motions, at leaft of no wider lateral motions than thofe which are ne- ceflary in grinding the food ; but the hinge of the jaw is a complex and very curious one, which {hall be ex- plained in its proper place. 6. The alveolar process, or the long range of fockets for the teeth, refembles that of the upper jaw. The javr, as the body grovrs, is flowly increafmg in length, and the teeth are added in proportion to the growth of the jaws. When the jaws have acquired their full fize, the fockets are completely filled ; the lips are extended, and the mouth is truly formed. In the decline of life, the teeth fall out, and the fockets are reabforbed, and carried clean away, as if they had never been ; fo that the chin projects, the cheeks become hollow, and the lips fall in, the fureft marks of old age. The fucceflive changes of the form of the jaw are worthy of being mentioned once more ; firft, That in the child, the jaw confifts of two bones, which are join- ed

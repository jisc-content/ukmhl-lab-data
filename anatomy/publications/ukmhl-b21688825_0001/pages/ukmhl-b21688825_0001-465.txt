It goes down along the bones, chiefly on their fore parts, and is but little obferved on their Tides. It is weaker in the neck,where there is much motion; ftronger in theTack, where there is none; weaker again in the loins, where the vertebras move; but ftill on the bodies of all the vertebrae it is feen white, Alining, and tendinous. We can diftinguifh all along the fpine interruptions and fafciculi, or firmer bundles, going from piece to piece of the fpine; which fafciculi are indeed very feldom continued without interruption farther than the length of two or three vertebras; yet the whole is fo much continued, that it is confidered as one uninterrupted fheath, and is called the external or anterior va- gina, or {Hgament of the spine *. But ftill the canal of the fpine were left open and undefended, rough and dangerous to the fpinal mar- row, if internal ligaments were not added to thefe. The rings of the vertebras are held at a confiderable diftance from each other, by the thicknefs of the inter- vertebral fubflance, and by the correfponding length of the oblique procefles : but this fpace is filled up by a flrong flat ligament, which goes from the edge of one ring to the edge of another; and fo extending from the articulating procefles, backwards to the fpinous pro- * The IIGAMENTUM COMMUNE ANTERIUS, FASCIA L0NG1TU- DINALIS ANTERIOR, FASCIA LIGAMENTOSA, &C.

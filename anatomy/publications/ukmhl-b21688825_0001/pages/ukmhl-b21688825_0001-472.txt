428 JOINTS OF THE the ligaments of the oppofite Tides meet; and this meeting forms a cord acrofs the upper part of the ffernum, which is named inter, clavicular liga- i-ENT, Thus is the clavicle fixed to the fternum, and another broad ligament alfo ties it to the firft rib. The joining of the clavicle with the fcapula is by the edge of the fiat clavicle touching the edge of the acromion procefies with a narrow but fiat articulat- ing furface. Roth furfaces, viz. of the acromion and of the clavicle, are covered with a thin articulating cartilage : in fonte fubjects a moveable cartilage is alfo found here. It is a regular joint, and is very feldom obliterated 3 yet its motion, though continual, is not very free 3 it is rather a fluffing and bending of the fcapula upon this bone, favo\iring the play of the other joints. It is fecured firft by a capfular ligament, which is in itfelf delicate and thin, but which is ftrengthened by many ligamentous bands, which pafs (over the capfule) betwixt the clavicle and the acromion procefs; the clavicle, as it pafles over the point of the coracoid procefs, is tied down to it by a ligament of confiderable ftrength, which comes from the point of the coracoid procefs, is implanted into the lower or inner edge of the clavicle, and is named LIGAMENTUM COMMUNE TE.APEZOIDES 3 trapezoid,On account of its fquare form, and commune, becaufe it goes from the fcapula to the clavicle; while other li- gaments, going from one procefs of the fcapula to an- other, are named proper or peculiar ligaments of the fcapula. There is a fmall flip of ligament which joins this, coming from the tendon of the fubclavian muf* cle. SHOULDER

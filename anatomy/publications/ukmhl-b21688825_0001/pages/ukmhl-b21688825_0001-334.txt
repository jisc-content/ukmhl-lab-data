2^0 MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION, &C. in office, for they raife the ribs along with the inter- coftal mufcles. CXVII. THe TRIANGULARIS STERNI, or STERNO costal is, is a depreflor of the ribs ; an internal muf- cle lying chiefly on the inner face of the fternum, and on the cartilages of the ribs. It is very generally con- fidered as a triangular mufcle on each fide, but fome confider it as three or four mufcles under the title of ftemo-coftales. â€¢ There are four flips lying on the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and fixth ribs. The lower portion of the triangularis arifes from the enfiform cartilage, and is inferted into the third or fourth rib ; the third arifes from the middle of the fternum, and goes off from the edges of that bone to be inferted into the third rib. The fourth or uppermoft portion is often awanting ; it goes off in part alfo from the inner furface of the fternum, but more commonly from the third rib, and goes to the fecond rib. In a dog they are much larger than in a man. Their office is to deprefs the ribs. And thefe portions are all conjoined at their roots, which gives the whole mufcle the triangular fhape. The true ufes of the intercoftales, fubcoftales, and triangularis fterni, have been difputed ; but if the firft rib be more fixed than the other ribs, then the inter- coftals proceeding downwards from the firft rib muft raife all the thorax; and if the fternum be more fixed than the ribs, then the fterno-coftales mufcles going upwards from the fternum muft pull down the ribs.

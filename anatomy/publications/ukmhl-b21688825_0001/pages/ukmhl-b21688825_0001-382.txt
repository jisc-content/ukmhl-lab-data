338 MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. 3. THE THIGH IS MOVED FORWARDS AND INWARDS By the Pfoas magnus Iliacus Internus, Peftinales, Triceps, which is im- planted in- to the Trochanter minor, Linea afpera, Fascialis. I begin with this mufcle, as it is necef- fary in the difle&ion. The thigh is inclofed in a very ftrong fheath, which, like that of the arm, fends down among the mufcles ftrong tendinous fepta or partitions ; and the mufcles areinclofed in thefe fepta; and the great mufcles of the leg are fupported by it in their ftrong and continual actions. The tendinous fafcia of the thigh arifes chiefly from the fpine of the ilium, partly (over the groin) from the external oblique mufcle of the abdomen. Every fafcia has fomething added by each mufcle, and takes a new increafe and adhefion at each bone which it pafles. It is always ftrengthened by adhefions to joints, and comes down from them thicker upon the mufcles below ; and fo this fafcia of the thigh, which arifes chiefly from the fpine of the ilium, de- fcends, covering all the mufcles of the thigh : it fends partitions down to the linea afpera and trochanters ; it has a new adhefton and a new fource of tendinous fibres at the knee ; it adheres moft remarkably at the inner fide of the tibia, and then defcends to the bran; It covers all the leg, and is again reinforced at the ankle : and this I believe to be a jufter hiftory than the common idea of making it an expanfion of the fmall tendon of the fmall mufcle,which I am now to defcribe; for the fafcialis is too eflential to the ftrength of the leg to depend upon fo inconfiderable an origin, and would

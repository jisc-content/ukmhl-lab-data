OF THE FORMATION 6 ginal bone, were in no degree dependent on the peri- ofteum, but were generated from the internal veffels of the bone itfelf: That the periofteum did indeed ap- pear as early as the cartilage which is to produce the bone, feeming to bound the cartilage, and give it form ; but that the periofteum was at firfl but a loofe tiffue of cellular fubftance, without the appearance of veffels, or any mark of blood, adhering chiefly to the heads or proceffes, while it hardly touched the body of the bone. He alfo found that the bone grew, became vafcular, had a free circulation of red blood, and that then only the veffel of the periofteum began to carry red blood, or to adhere to the bone. We know that the bones begin to form in fmall nuclei, in the very centre of their cartilage, or in the very centre of the yet fluid callus, far from the furface, where they might be affifted by the periofteum; and that oflification begins firft in the middle of the long bones, where the periofteum does not adhere, and is formed much later in the heads and proceffes, whofe connexion with the periofteum is very clofe. Thus has the formation of bone been falfely attri- buted to a gelatinous effufion, gradually hardened; or to that blood which muft be poured out from the rup- tured veffels round a fractured bone ; or to the indura- tion and change of the periofteum, depoftting layer after layer, till it completed the form of the bone. But when, neglecting theory, we fet ourfelves to ex- amine, with an unbiaffed judgment, the procefs of na- ture in forming the bones, as in the chick, or in reftor- ing them, as in broken limbs, a fucceflion of pheno- mena prefent themfelves, the moft orderly, beautiful, and

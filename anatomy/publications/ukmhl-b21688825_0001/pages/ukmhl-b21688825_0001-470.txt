425 JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE. the other to the vertebra below: they gradually va- nifti, and mix with the periofteum upon the bodies of the vertebras; thefe are named ligamentum capi- telli costaruMj as belonging to the little heads of the ribs. The back of the rib touches the fore part of the tranfverfe procefs, and is articulated there; confe- quently there is a fmall capfular ligament belonging to this joint alfo :• but this joint is further fecured by two fmall ligaments, which come from the tranfverfe procefs of the vertebra, and take hold on the neck of the rib: one fhort ligament coming from the point ©f the tranfverfe procefs, is behind the rib, and is thence named ligamentum tran&versarium ex- ternum ; another, rather longer, comes from the inner face of the tranfverfe procefs, goes a little round the neck of the rib, is implanted into the lower edge of the rib, and is named ligamentum transversariuu internum: another fmall ligament exactlyoppofke to this, going into the neck of the rib upon its back part, is alfo very regular; and other fubfidiary liga- ments from different points aflift thefe or fupply their place. The ribs are fixed into the fternum by their car- tilages ; each of which has a round head, a diftindt fecket, a regular capfule, and ligaments which ex- pand upon the furface of the fternum, much in the fame way that the ligamenta capitclli expand upon the bodies of the vertebrse : a tendinous membrane alfo binds the' cartilages of the ribs one to another, crofles over the interface, and fo covers the intercof- tal mufc-les with a fort of fafcia ; and the whole fur-

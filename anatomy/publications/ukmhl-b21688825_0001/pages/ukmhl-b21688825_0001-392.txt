348 MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE* the ilium, viz. that part which forms the focket for the thigh-bone, and a little higher up; and from the border of the fciatic notch. It forms a fhort, flat, and ftrong tendon, which is fixed under the root of the trochanter major, betwixt the trochanter and the neck of the bone : fo that thefe mufcles are inferted in this fucceflion ; firfl, the great glutaeus, below the root of the trochanter, and into the linea afpera; the middle glutaeus into the back and top of the trochanter ; and the fmalleft of the glutasi is implanted into the rough- nefs under the root of the trochanter. Gemini.â€”The gemini are two mufcles, or rather one biceps mufcle; but the heads are fo diflinCt that they are reckoned two, and fo much alike that they are named gemini. CLXVI. The uppeymoft, the larger and flronger mufcle, arifes from the fpinous procefs of the os ifchium. CLXVII. The fecond, or fmaller head, arifes in like manner from the tuber ifchii, upon its ball or outer end. They are flefhy in their whole length. They meet and unite their tendons at the great trochanter. They are inferted firmly, along with the following ten- don, at the root of that procefs. CLXVIIX. The pyriformis, fometimes called ili- acus internus or pyramidalis, comes from the hollow of the facrum, runs in the fame line with the lefler glutaeus, and is inferted with the two Iafl named mufr cles in the root of the great trochanter. Its origin is from the hollow of the facrum, riling from the vertebrae of that bone by three or four fmall flefhy digits, and from the facro-fciatic notch j it runs 3 betwixt

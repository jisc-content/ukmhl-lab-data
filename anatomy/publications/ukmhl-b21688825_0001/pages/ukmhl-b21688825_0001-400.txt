356 MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. The flefhy cufhion which covers the inner fide of the knee joint. Its tendon embraces the rotula fomewhat in the fame circular form with that of the vaftus exter- nus : and, like the externus, it fends fome fibres acrofs the knee-pan, to be inferted in the outer part of the head of the tibia. The rectus, and the vastus externus, internus, and crur^us, form one lage mafs of fielh, which embraces and inclofes all the thigh bone; and they are fo connected, that the crurasus cannot be feparated, and cannot be neatly diftinguilhed. The ufe of thefe four mufcles is evident to extend the leg and to bend the thigh on the trunk, or reci- procally to bend the trunk on the thigh. This, or thefe two motions alternately, is the common ufe of thefe mufcles, as in walking; and they are molt pecu- liarly ufeful in running and leaping. After defcribing a large mafs, conjoined in one ten- don, and concurring in one fimple action, it is fuperflu- ous to fay that its power mull be great. This power mull be ftill further increafed by the rotula, which removes the force from the centre, and gives the ad- vantage of a pulley, which it really and truly is : with- out this pulley thefe mufcles could be of no ufe in certain fituations; for inflance, in the recumbent pof- ture: for then the extending mufcles being in the fame line with their bones, could have no farther power ; but the r'e&us, by the pulley of the rotula, and by its attachment to the bafin, raifes the trunk, or at leaft helps the pfoas, the iliacus, and the mufcles of the belly.

OF THE FORMATION 18 the geons ufed fo much, made no other impreflion upon the bone than to excite a particular titillation and heat, rather pleafant than painful, running along the courfe of the bone. But there is a deception in all this. A bone may be exquifitely fenfitde, and yet give no pain; a paradox which is very eafily explained. A bone may feel acutely, and yet not fend its fenfation to the brain. It is not fit that parts Ihould in this fenfe feel, which are fo continually expofed to {hocks and blows, and all the accidents of life ; which have to fuffer all the motions which the other parts require. In this fenfe, the bones, the cartilages, ligaments, burfse, and all the parts that relate to joints, are quite infenfible and dead. A bone does not feel, or its feel- ings are not conveyed to the brain; but with this fingle exception, it fhows every mark of life. Scrape a bone, and its veflels bleed ; cut or bore a bone, and its granulations fprout up ; break a bone, and it heals; or cut a piece of it away, and more bone will be rea- dily produced; hurt it in any way, and it inflames ; burn it, and it dies: take any proof of fenfibility, but the mere feeling of pain, and it will anfwer to the proof. In fhort, thefe parts have a fenfibility which belongs to themfelves, but have no feelings in corre- fpondence with the general fyftem. A bone feels (limuli, and is excited to read; in- juries produce inflammation in the bones, as in the foft parts; and then fwelling and fpongy loofenefs, and a fulnefs of blood, fuppuration, ulcer, and the death and difcharge of the difeafed bone enfue. When the texture of a bone is thus loofened by inflammation, its feeling is roufed j and the hidden fenfibility of

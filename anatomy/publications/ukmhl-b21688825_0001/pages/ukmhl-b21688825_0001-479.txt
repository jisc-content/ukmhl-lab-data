SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. 435 efpedally in the palm, fo as to add ftrength to their peculiar ligaments; and in the palm, the tendons for the fingers run over it: fo it forms on one fide an ad- ditional ligament for the carpus; on the other, it forms the floor of the tendinous (heath, a fmooth and lubricated furface for the tendons to run upon. This general ligament is ftrengthened by particular ones coming from the ftyloid precedes of the radius and of the ulna. But there are fo many Irregular points of bone about the wrift, that the little fafciculi, with which this capfule is covered and ftrengthened, are innumerable. Within this joint, and ftretching from, the groove betwixt the fcaphoid and lunated bones, there .is an internal ligament of a foft and pulpy na- ture; it is named ligAmentum mucosum: but the ve- ry name fhews that it is lefs valuable as a ligament fince (the joint is already well enough fecured), than as a conductor for the lacunas or dufts which feparate the mucus. 2. The articulation by which the hand performs all its turning motions is that of the radius with the ulnathis is fet apart altogether from the ge- neral articulation of the joint. The lateral cavity of the radius receives the little round head of the ulna; they are inclofed in their own peculiar cap- fule; which is fo loofe about the-bones, that although it is a regular capfule of the common form, it has the name of membrana capsularis sacciformis. Thus there is one joint within another; a moveable cartilage betwixt them, and the capfule of one, the more moveable joint, peculiarly wide, and not fo ftrong; all which ihould be confidered in thinking about luxations of the wrift.

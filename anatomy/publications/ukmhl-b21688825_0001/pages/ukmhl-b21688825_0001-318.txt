274 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C» the knuckle, and below it, it is again conne&ed with the t :ndons both of the ring-finger and of all the others by the crofs bands or expanfions. Whatever has been faid of the ufe of the laft mufcle is to be underftood of this ; as its extending its proper finger, aflifting the others by its communicating band, and in its extending the wrift when the fill is clenched. Its infertion is into the back of the fecond joint of the little-finger, along with the interoffsei and lumbricales. Its tendon has alfo a fmall flit; for the head of the proper extenfor of the little finger, and the heads of the common extenfors of the others, are inferted into the top of the fecond phalanx, juft under the firft joint. They fend off at the fides tendinous flips, which, paf- fing along the edges of the bones, do, in conjunction with the tendons of the interoffasi and lumbricales, form a fplit tendon, which meets by two curves at the foot of the laft bone of the fingers to move the laft joint. XCVIII. The extensor primus pollicis, is the fhorteft of the three extenfors of the thumb. It is named by Albinus and others abductor longus ; but fince every mufcle that extends the thumb muft pull it away from the hand, every one of them might* be with equal propriety named abduCtors. The extenfor primus lies juft on the fore edge of the radius, crofting it obliquely. It arifes about the middle of the fore-arm, from th$ edge of the ulna, which gives rife to the interroffeous membrane itfelf, and alfo from the convex furface of the radius. Th«

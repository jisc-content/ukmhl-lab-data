43 OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL. the nofe, has been miftaken for a fra&ure, and trepan- ned ; and often in older fkulls, the futures are en- tirely obliterated, all over the head. If the furgeon fhould pour ink upon the Ikull, he would have reafon to be alhamed of an experiment fo awkward and un- fuccefsful; and for the old contrivance of a wire or cord held in the mouth, it cannot be done, fince the patient is commonly infenfible ; and even, though lefs hurt, his feelings, after fuch an accident, mull be very confufed; he mull be too liable to be deceived ; and we cannot, on fuch flender evidence as this, perform fo cruel an operation as cutting up the fcalp, or fo dan- gerous a one as the trepan. For various reafons we are careful to trace the bones from their original foft and griflly Hate, to their perfect condition of hai d bone ; and mod of all, we are con- cerned to do fo in the head, where, in childhood, the appearances are not fmgular and curious only, but have always been fuppofed to indicate fome wife and ufeful purpofe. It is in this original condition of the foft and growing bones, that anatomifls have fought to find a theory of the futures, how they are formed, and for what ufes. It has been remarked, that the number of pieces in the Ikull, is infinitely greater in the child than in the man, Thefe bones pilifying from their centre towards their circumference, it happens, of courfe, that the fibres are clofe at the centre of offifica- tion, and are more fcattered at the extremities of the bone: when thefe fcattered fibres of oppofite bones meet, the growing fibres of one bone fhoot into the interftices of that which is oppofed : The fibres (till

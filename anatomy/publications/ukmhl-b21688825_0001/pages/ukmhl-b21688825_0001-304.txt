l6o MUJ3CLES OP THE ARM, &C. along the middle of the fore-arm fomewhat in the courfe of the radius, and is one of the five mufcles which rife by one common tendon, and which are, for fome length, tied together. It arifes tendinous from the inner condyle; the ten- don very fhort and thick. This tendon, at its origin, is fplit into many (feven) heads, which are interlaced with the heads of the fublimis, profundus, palmaris, &c.; confequently this mufcle not only arifes from the internal condyle, but alfo from the intermufcular par- titions (as from that betwixt it and the fublimis): it forms a long tendon, which, becoming at lafl very fmall and round, runs under the annular ligament: it runs in a gutter peculiar to itfelf; but in this canal it is moveable, not fixed : it then expands a very little, and is inferted into the metacarpal bone of the fore- finger, alfo touching that which fupports the thumb. Its ufe is chiefly to bend the wrift upon the radius. But when we confider its oblique dire&ion, it will alfo be very evident that it mull have fome effect in pronation ; and this, like many of the mufcles of the fore-arm, although defigned for a different purpofe, will alfo have fome effect in bending the fore-arm at the elbow-joint. LXXXVI. The flexor carpi ulnaris is a long mufcle, much like the former; but as its courfe is along the radius or upper edge of the fore-arm, this runs along the ulna or lower edge. It comes off tendinous from the inner condyle of the os humeri, by the common tendon of all the muf- cles: It has alfo, like the pronator teres, a feccnd head (viz. from the olecranon procefs of the ulna), 12 which

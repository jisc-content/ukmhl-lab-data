OF THE TRUNK. 11 2 in the vertebrae of the neck, as in thofe of the loins, g cup or hollow for receiving the intervertebral fubftance* but the furfaces of the body are flat or plain, and the articulating procefles are oblique, and make as it were one articulation with the body; for the lower furface of the body being not hollow but plain, and inclined forwards, and the articulating procefles being alfo plain, and inclined backwards, the two furfaces are oppofed to each other, and the one prevents the vertebra from Aiding forwards, and the other prevents it from Aiding backwards, while a pretty free and general motion is allowed. The spinous processes of the neck are for the infertion of many mufcles, and therefore they are fplit. This bifurcation of the fpinous procefs is not abfolutely peculiar to the cervical vertebras ; for fome- times, though rarely, the others are fo: and it is only in the middle of the neck that even they are forked ; for the firft vertebra is a plain ring, without any tranf- verfe procefs, becaufe there are few mufcles attached to it; and the laft vertebra of the neck is fcarcely bifurcated, approaching to the nature of the dorfal vertebrae; for it is long and aquiline; is deprefled towards the back, and is fo much longer than the others, as to be diftinguifhed by the name of verte- bra prominens. The transverse processes of the neck are alfo bifurcated, becaufe there are a great many fmall mufcles inferted into them alfo. But the molt curious pecu- liarity of the tranfverfe procefles is, that each of them is perforated for the. tranfmiflion of the great artery, which is named vertebral artery, becaufe it pafles through thefe b.oles in the vertebrae which form altoge- ther a bony c^nal for the artery.

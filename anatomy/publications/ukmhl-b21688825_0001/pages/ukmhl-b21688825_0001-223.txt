SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. 179 N 2 5. The the olecranon checks into its place, and prevents luxa- tion forwards; and the arm again being bent, as in ftriking, pufhing, or faving ourfelves from falls, the coronoid procefs prevents luxation backwards. So the joint confills of the olecranon and the coronoid procefs as the two guards; and of the figmoid cavi- ty or hollow of articulation betwixt them: but the fmaller or upper head of the radius alfo enters into the joint, and lying upon the inner fide of the coronoid procefs, it makes a fmall hollow there, in v/hich it rolls; and this fecond hollow, touching the edge of the figmoid cavity, forms a double figmoid cavity; of which the firftjor greater sigmoid cavity,is for receiving the lower end of the humerus; and the fecond, or lesser sigmoid cavity, for receiving the upper head of the radius. 4. The form of the bone being prif- matic or triangular, it has, like the tibia, three ridges ; one of which is turned towards a correfponding ridge in the radius, and betwixt them the interolfeous liga- ment is ftretched; and this interolfeous ligament fills all the arch or open fpace betwixt the radius and ulna, and faves the necelfity of much bone; gives as firm an origin to the mufcles as bone could have done, and binds the bones of the fore arm together fo ftrongly, that though the ulna belongs entirely to the elbow-joint, and the radius as entirely to the wrift, they have never been known to depart from each other, nor to yield to any force, however great*. * Sometimes the radius is luxated from the lower head of the ulna ; but this dialiafis, as it is called, is quite of another kind.

JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE. 423 vagina or fheath, it does by no means furround nor in- clofe the fpinal marrow, but is entirely confined to the covering of the bodies of the vertebras, never going be- yond the fetting off of the articulating furfaces, or the place where the nerves go out. It adheres firmly to the bones, and does not belong at all to the fpinal mar- row. It fhould rather be called a ligament for the bones than a fheath for the medulla. The anterior ligament prevents framing of the fpine backwards: this one prevents the bending of the fpine too much forwards; and they inclofe betwixt them the bodies of the vertebras and their invertebral fubflances. There is yet a third internal ligament, which belongs entirely to the neck; it is called apparatus ligamen- tosus colei; it begins from the edge of the occipital bone, defcends in the canal of the vertebrae, is thin and flat, and adheres firmly to the body of each ver* tebra, covering the tooth-like procefs. The irregular fafciculi, or bundles of this ligament, flretch from bone to bone; and the whole of the apparatus' liga- mentofus extends from the edge of the occipital hole to the fourth vertebra of the neck, where it ends. Its chief ufe is alfo as a ligament, merely fixing the head to the neck. The dura matter is within thefe, imme- diately inclofing the fpinal marrow. The ligaments which I have juft named may be well enough allowed to be <c at once ligaments for the bones, and a fheath for the medulla.” But there is no fuch fheath as that called ligamentum infundibiliforme by Winflow; for either they are peculiar and diftindt ligaments for the bones, fuch as I have defcribed, or they belong exclu- lively to the medulla, as the dura mater, which i§ iu- £ e 4 deed

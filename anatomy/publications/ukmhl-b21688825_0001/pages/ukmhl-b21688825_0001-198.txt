BONFS OF THE 15* hollows, fo as to be received into the interftice be* twixt the condyles ; and at the back part, which is the higheft point of the ridge, an internal ligament ties the tibia to the thigh-bone. This fpongy head has aifo a rough margin, to which the capfular ligament is tied ; on the fore part of this bone, juft below the knee, there is a bump for receiving the great ligament of the patella, or, in other words, the great tendon of all the extenfor mufcles of the leg; and laftiy, there is upon the outer fide of this fpongy head, juft under the margin of the joint, a fmooth articulating furface, (like a dimple impreffed with the finger), for receiving the head of the fibula. It is under the margin of the joint, for the fibula does not enter at all into the knee joint; it is only laid upon the fide of the tibia, fixed to it by ligaments, but not received into any thing like a cavity. 2. The body of the bone is of a prifmatic or trian- gular form, and its three edges or acute angles are very high lines running along its whole length ; one line a little waved, and turned directly forwards, is what is called the fliin. At the top of this ridge is that bump into which the ligament of the rotula or patella is implanted; and the whole length of this acute line is fo eafily traced through the lkin, that we can never be miftaken about fradtures of this bone. Another line lefs acute than this is turned diredtly backwards; and the third acute line, which completes the triangular form, is turned towards the fibula, to receive a broad ligament, or interofieous membrane, which ties the two bones together. 3. The lower head of the tibia compofes the chief parts of the ankle-joint. The lower head of the tibia k

238 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C, vicle, and confequently the fhoulder, downwards, and? fo to fix them. Many have afFe&ed to find other mufcles of refpb ration than thofe which diredtly belong to the ribs. Among thefe are reckoned the ferratus major, the pectoralis minor, &c.; but there is much reafon to* doubt whether any mufcles can have much effedt which do not belong properly to the ribs : and it is manifeft, that the fubclavian can have none, fmce the firft rib is quite rigid, has fo little length of car- tilage that it cannot bend nor move. The fcapula is thus moved in every poffible direc= tion ; upwards, by the levator and the trapezius ; back- wards, by the rhomboides, affifled by other orders of the trapezius; downwards and backwards, by the loweft order of fibres in the trapezius ; downwards and forwards, by the ferratus major anticus ; dirediiy downwards, by the ferratus, balanced by the trapezius, and aflifted by the fubclavius ; and directly forwards, by the peftoralis minor.

It arifes from two-thirds of the clavicle next, the fternum ; from all the edges of the fternum ; the cartilaginous endings of the fifth and fixth ribs. Where it arifes from the fternum, it is tendinous, and the fibres from the oppofite mufcle j crofs and mix, fo as to make a fort of fafcia covering the bone. It is flelhy where it arifes from the ribs, and there it mixes with the external.

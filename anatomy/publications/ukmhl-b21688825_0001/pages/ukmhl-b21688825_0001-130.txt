OF THE BONES 85 quence of the oflification having begun in many points: no particular defign of nature has been fup- pofed. The futures, if they require names, are to be named after the bones which they unite. OSSA NASI.â€”The offanafi arefmall bones, rather thin, having no cancelli, being merely firm and condenfed plates. They are convex outwardly, fo that the two together form nearly an arch. They are oppofed to each other by a pretty broad furface, fo that their thin arch is firm. They have a flat rough furface, by'which they are laid upon the rough fur- face of the frontal bone; fo that there alfo their con-, nedtion is flrong. They are inclofed by a branch of the upper jaw-bone, which ftretching upwards, is na- med its nafal proofs: and they lie with their edges under it in one part, and above it in another, in fuch a way, that they cannot eafily be forced in. Laftly, their lower edge is rough, for the firm attachment of the cartilages of the nofe; and their loweft point, or that where the bones of the nofe and the griftles of the nofe are joined, is the moft prominent point (or as it is vulgarly called the bridge) of the nofe j from which connection, notwithftanding its firmnefs, the cartila- ges are fometimes luxated. Os unguis, fo named from its being of the fizeand lhape of a nail; or fometimes named the os lachry- mal E, from its holding the duft which conveys the tears, is that thin fcale of bone which I have defcribed as belonging to the os sethmoides. It is commonly de- fcribed as a diftinCt bone; it is a thin flat bone, a fingle fcale, without any cancelli; it is found in the inner angle

MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. 343 The triceps confifts of three heads, which lie in dif- ferent layers, one above the other; and have fo little connexion among themfelves, that they have been more commonly, and I think properly, defcribed as three mufcles. Thefe three parts of the mufcle are indeed for one common ufe: but they are of very different forms ; for they do not even lie on the fame plane : one is long: another fhorter by one half; a third longer than both the other two; fo that they have been commonly defcribed under the names of adductor PRIMUSOrLONGUS; ADDUCTORSECUNDUS orBREVIS J ADDUCTOR TERTIUS Or MAGNUS. 1. The adductor longus is the uppermoft layer ; its border (for it, like the pe&inalis, is a flat mufcle) ranges with the border of the pe&inalis. It arifes from the upper and fore part of the pubis by a Ihort roundifh tendon, very ftrong : it fwells into a thick fiefhy belly, not round, but flattened ; the belly grows flatter as it goes down towards the thigh-bone; it ends in a flat and fhort tendon, which is inferted web-like into the linea afpera in all its middle part, viz. about four inches. Thus the mufcle is of a triangular form, with its bafe in the linea afpera, and its apex on the pubis. Its head or origin lies betwixt the pe&inalis and the gracilis : its upper edge ranges with the pec- tinalis; its lower edge lies,upon the triceps magnus. It is called longus, becaufe it is longer than the next head. 2. The adductor brevis lies under the adduflor longus, and is of another layer of mufcles ; for as the firft layer confifts of the pe&inalis, triceps longus, and gracilis, this layer confifts of the obturator externus, z 4 triceps

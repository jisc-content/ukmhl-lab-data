OF THE BONES ,98 tril, with its arched fide towards the nofe. This fpongy bone differs from the fpongy procefs of the aethmoid bone, in being lefs turbinated or complex ; in having no cells connected with it ; and perhaps it is lefs diredtly related to the organ of fmell. If polypi arife from the upper fpongy bone, we can ufe lefs freedom, and dare hardly pull them away, for fear of injuring the cribriform plate of the aethmoid bone : we are in- deed not abfolutely prohibited from pulling the polypi from the upper fpongy bone : but we are more at eafe, in pulling them from the lower one, fince it is quite an infulated bond. When peafe, or any fuch foreign bodies, are detained in the nofe, it mull be from their fwelling, and being detained, among the fpongy bones. The fpongy bones are not abfolutely limited in their number: there is fometimes found betwixt thefe two, a third fet of fmall turbinated bones, commonly belonging to the aethmoid bone. VOMER.â€”The nofe is completed by the vomer, which is pamed from its refemblance to a plough- fhare, and which divides the two nofirils from each other. It is a thin and tlender bone, confifting evi- dently of two plates much comprefled together ; very denfe and ftrong, but (bill fo thin, as to be tranfparent. The two plates of which the vomer is compofed, fplit or part from each other at every edge of it, fo as to form a groove on every fide. 1. On its upper part, or as we may call it, its bafe, by which it Hands upon the fkull, the vomer has a wide groove, receiving the pro- jecting point of the.sethmoid and fphaenoid bones : thus it Hands very firm and fecure, and capable of refifiing very

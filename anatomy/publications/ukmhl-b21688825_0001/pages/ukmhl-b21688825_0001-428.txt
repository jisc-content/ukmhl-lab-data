Now this middle aponeurofis fends down a deep ftrong partition on each fide of it; which is the belt reafon that I know for making thefe three diftindt apo- neurofes : for, by thefe perpendicular partitions, the , hollow of the foot is feparated into three diftindt chambers: under the middle one are concealed the tendons of the long flexors, with the lumbricales and ftiort flexor mufcles ; under the outer one, the flexor and abductor of the little finger ; and under the in- ner one, the addudtor, flexor, and abdudtors of the great toe. The ufes of this great and very ftrong aponeurofis are: That it protects all the parts, the blood-veflels, mufcles, and nerves that lie under it: That it fupports the arch of the foot, both in Handing and in motion, palling from heel to toe, like a bow-ftring, acrofs its arch : That it binds down the mufcles, and confe- quently fupports and aflifts them in their ftrong adtions: That it gives origin, or part of their origin, to many of the mufcles ; which by their frequent and irregular adhefion to it, are very difficult to difledt: That it forms openings or rings, in which the tendons of the other mufcles pafs.

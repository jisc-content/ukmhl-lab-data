SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. I 89 proach each other, increafmg the hollownefs cf the hand, to form what is called Diogenes’s cup. It is far- ther neceffary to obferve, into how fmall a fpace the carpal bones are comprefled; how great a fhare of the hand the metacarpal bones form; and how far down they go into the hollow of the hand. For I have feen a furgeon, who, not having the finalleft fuf- picion that their lower ends were fo near the wrift as they really are, has, in place of cutting the bone neat- ly in its articulation with the carpus, broken it, or tried to cut it acrofs in the middle.

It rolls widely and freely, like other ball and focket joints : it is oppofed to the other fingers in grafping, and, from its very fuperior ftrength, the thumb is named Polex, from polere. The fingers have each of them three bones, i. The firft bone is articulated with the metacarpal bones by a ball and focket; the focket, or hollow on the lower part of the firft finger bone, being fet down upon the large round head of the metacarpal bone. 2.

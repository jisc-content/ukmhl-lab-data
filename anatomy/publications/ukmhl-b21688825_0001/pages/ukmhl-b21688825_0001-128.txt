DEsCRtETtoN OF THE %4 fecond branch of the 5th pair of nerves to the upped jaw. 4* The for.amen ovale, is an oval hole, larger thart the foramen rotundum; about half an inch behind it; and transmitting the third branch of the 5 th pair to the lower jaw. 5. The foramen spinaLe, or spinous hole * is a very fmall round hole, as if made with a large pin; is in the very point of the fpinous procefs ; is one third of an inch behind the oval hole, and tranfmits the fmall artery, lefs than a crow-quill, which conflitutes the chief afte?y of the dura mater, viz. that artery which makes its impreffion upon the parietal bone. 6. There is Hill another hole, which tranfmits a nerve, curious in this refped, that it is not going out from the fkull, but returning into it; for the fecond branch of the 5th pair, or the fuperior maxillary nerve, fends a fmall branch backwards, which having come with- in the fkuD,, enters the temporal bone, and goes to join itfelf to the portio dura of the 7 th pair, and in its way gives a fmall branch, to help cut the fender begin- ning of the great fympathetic nerve. This retrogade branch of the maxillary nerve gets back again into the Ikull, by a hole-which is found, juft under the root of each pterygoid procefs, whence it is named ptery- goid hole *5 or by many, is named aft?r its difcover- er, the Vidian hole|. This hole is almoft hidden * This retrogade twig, is the little nerve which perforates the os petrofum on its fore part.â€™ Vide page 70. f Vidus Vidius, a profeffor of Paris, and phyfician to Francis the firft. under

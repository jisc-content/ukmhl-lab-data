It is alfo particularly cir- cular, making more than half a circle from its head to the extremity, where it joins the fternum ; it has, of courfe, no angle, and wants the difeorted twilling of the other ribs. The feeond rib is alfo round, like the firft rib. The eleventh and twelfth, or the floating ribs, are exceedingly fmall and delicate ; and their car- tilage terminates in an acute point, unconnected with 'the fternum. And, laftly, the heads of the flrft, and of the eleventh and twelfth ribs, are rounder than any of the others; for thefe three have their heads im- planted into the flat fide of one vertebra only; while all the others have theirs implanted betwixt the bo- dies of two vertebrae. The cartilages of the ribs complete the form of the thorax, and form all the lunated edge of that cavity; and it is from this cartilaginous circle that the great muf- ele of the diaphragm has its chief origin, forming the partition betwixt the thorax and the abdomen. The farther end of each rib fwells out thick and fpongy, and has a fmall focket for lodging the cartilage ; for thefe cartilages are not joined like the intervertebral fub- flances with their bones ; but there is a fort of joint very little moveable indeed, but fall having a rude focket, and a ftrong capfular ligament, and being ca- pable of luxation by falls and blows ; arid the implan- tations into the fternum are evidently by fair round fockets, which are eafily diftinguifhed upon the two edges of that bone. Thefe cartilages may be enume- rated

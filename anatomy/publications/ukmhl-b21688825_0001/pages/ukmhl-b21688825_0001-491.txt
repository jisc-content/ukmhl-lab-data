447 THIGH, LEG, AND ANKLE. In ihort, they referable the fhape of the label which we put round a wine decanter; and the two horns are tied to the tubercle or ridge that {lands in the mid- dle of the articular furface of the tibia; and confequent* ly they are turned cowards each other fo as to touch in their points. There are here, as in the other joints, maffes of fat inclofmg the fimbriated ends of the mucous duCts. Thefe fimbrise and fatty bundles are formed chiefly round the circumference of the patella, commonly furrounding it with a complete fringe; they are alfo found at the back of the cavity, about the crucial ligaments, and in all the interfaces of the joint; the fatty bundles filling up the interfaces, pro- tecting the mucous duCts from more violence than what is juft neceflary to empty them, and perhaps mixing their exudation with the mucus of the duds. Thefe mafles of fat lie covered by the delicate in- ternal furface of the capfule, and the mucous fimbrise projeCt from it. The inner furface of the capfule is fo much larger than the joint which it lines, that it makes many folds or lurks; and feveral of thefe are diftinguifhed by par- ticular names. Thus at each fide of the patella there are two fuch folds, the one larger than the other; whence they are named ligamentum alare majus, and ligamentum alare minus. Thefe two folds are like two legs, which join and form one middle fold, which runs acrofs in the very centre of the joint, viz. from the lower end of the patella to the point of the thigh-bone, in the middle betwixt the condyles. It keeps the loofer fatty bundles and fimbriated duCls in their place (viz, the hollow betwixt the condyles, where

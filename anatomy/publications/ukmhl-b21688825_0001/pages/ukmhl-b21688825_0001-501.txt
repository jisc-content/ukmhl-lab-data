THIGH, LEG, AND ARM. 457 tendons are allowed to pafs; it comes off from the heel in one point; it grows broader in the fame proportion as the foie of the foot grows broad ; it is divided into three narrow heads, which make forks, and are inferted into the roots of the fecond, third, and fourth toes ; and the great toe and the little toe have too fmaller or lateral aponeurofis, which cover their own particu- lar mufcles, and are implanted into the roots of the great tee and of the little toe. The burfse mucofse furround the ankle and foot in great numbers. None of them having any very direfl connection with the joint, and mod of them accom- panying the long tendons as they pafs behind the ankle, or in the foie of the foot, are of that kind which we call tendinous fheaths. Firft, There are fheaths of two or three inches long, which furround the tendons of the tibialis pofticus, and of the peronaei mufcles, as they pafs down behind the ankle. The fheaths of the pero- jiaei begin from that point where the tendons firft begin to rub againft the bone, and are continued quite down into the foie of the foot; making firft a common fheath for both tendons, and then a burfa peculiar to the ten- dons of the peronseus brevis mufcle, and about an inch in length. Where the peronseus longus begins to pafs under the foie of the foot, the fheath which inclofed it behind the ankle is fhut, and a new burfa begins ; in the fame manner, where the tendons of the flexor policis and flexor digitorum pedis pafs behind the inner ankle, a burfa of three inches in length furrounds them and facilitates the motion. As the tendons of the flexor mufcles go under the arch of the foot, they lie among foft parts, and rub chiefly againft the flefh of the mafia carnea

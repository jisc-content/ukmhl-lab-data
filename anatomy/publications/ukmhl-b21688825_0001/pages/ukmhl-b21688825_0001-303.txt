MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &Câ€ž 259 the tendinous expanfion is found* and fome pretend to fay that the expanfion is awanting when the mufcle is found. The aponeurofis, which covers the palm, is like the palm itfelf, of a triangular figure ; it begins from the fmall tendon of the palmaris longus, and gradually expands, covering the palm down-to the fmall ends of the metacarpal bones. Its fibres expand in form of rays j and towards the end there are crofs bands which hold them together and make them, ftronger; but it does not cover the two outer meta- carpal bones (the metacarpal of the fore-finger or of the little finger), or it only covers them with a very- thin expanfion. Now this palmar expanfion alfo fends down perpen- dicular divifions, which take hold on the edges of the metacarpal bones: and thus there being a perpendi- cular divifion to each edge of each metacarpal bone, there are eight in all, which form canals for the tendons of the fingers, and for the lumbricales mufcles. LXXXIV. The palmaris brevis is a thin flat cutaneous mufcle, which arifes properly from the edge of the palmar aponeurofis, near to the ligament of the wrifl:; whence it ftretches acrofs the hand in thin faf- ciculi of fibres, which are at laft: inferted into the meta- carpal bone, on which the little finger Hands, and into the lkin and fat on the edge of the palm. This is the palmaris cutaneus of fome authors, for which we can find no ufe except it were that of draw- ing in the lkin of the hand, and perhaps making the palmar expanfion tenfe. LXXXV. The flexor carpi radialis is a long thin mufcle arifing from the inner condyle, ftretching s 2 along

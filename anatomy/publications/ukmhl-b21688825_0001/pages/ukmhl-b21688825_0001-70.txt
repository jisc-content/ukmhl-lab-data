It mud be preferved by that moidure alone which exifts in its fubltance, and muft depend for its confidence upon its own conftitution j upon the due mixing up of its gluten and earth. Every part is preferved in its due confidence by the vefiels which form its fubfift- ence; and I fhould no more fuppofe fat neceffary for preferving the moidnefs of a bone, than for prevent- ing brittlenefs in the eye. This marrow is, perhaps, more an accidental depofition, than we at fird fight believe. We indeed find in it fuch a regularity of dructure, as feems to indicate fome very particular ufe ; but we find exactly the fame dru&ure in the common fat of the body. When, as we advance in years, more fat is depofited in the omentum, or round the heart, we cannot entertain the abfurd notion of fat being needed in our old age, to lubricate the bowels or the heart; no more is the marrow (which is not found in the child), accumulating in old age for preventing brit- tlenefs of the bones. The blood veffels of a bone are large, in proportion to the mafs of the bone : For fird one great trunk en- ters commonly about the middle of the bone, as in the thigh-bone, leg or arm, and is called the nutritious or medullary artery ; it penetrates into the central cavity of the bone, fpreads upwards and downwards, fupplying all the fubdance of the bone itfelf, and giving thofe delicate arteries which fecrete the marrow. Other arteries enter from without, at the fpongy ends of the bones, where the holes are not 'vifible only, but very large in the adult j particularly large arteries enter in- to

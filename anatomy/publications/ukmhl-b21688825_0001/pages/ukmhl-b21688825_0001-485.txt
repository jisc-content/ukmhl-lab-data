THIGH, LEG, AND ANKLE. 44* Hat fides. It is broad where it arifes from the bottom of the focket, is about an inch and a half in length, grows narrower as it goes outwards'towards the head of the bone, and is almoft round where it is implanted into the dimple in the head of the thigh-bone ; at wh'ch point it is fo fixed as to leave a very remarkable rough- nefs in the naked bone. But round the roots of this ligament, and in the bottom of the focket, there is left a pretty deep hollow, which is faid to be filled up with the fynovial gland. It is wonderful how eafily authors talk of the fynovial gland, as if they had feen it; they deferibe very formally its affections and difeafes,as when, hurt by a blow upon the trochanter ; yet there is no diftinft gland to be found. There is a fringed and rag- ged mafs lodged in the bottom of the focket, hanging out into the hollow, and continually rubbed by the ball of the thigh-bone in its motions: the fringes and points certainly are duÂ£ts from which we can fqueeze cut mucus ; but it is by no means proved that they belong to a fynovial gland ; and it looks rather as if the dufts were themfelves the fecreting organ, like the lacunas or mucous bags in the tongue, or in the urethra vagi- na, cefophagus, and other hollow tubes. Such a ftruc- ture is fitter for fuffering the ftrong preffure and con- tinual aflion of the thigh-bone than any determined gland. We fee then nothing but mucous duds of a fringed form, hanging down from this hollow into the cavity of the joint; a quantity of fat accompanying thefe fringes ; and a pappy mucous membrane, which keeps thefe fringes and fatty membranes orderly and in their places, and which ties them fo to the angles of the triangular ligament, that they mull move with the motions

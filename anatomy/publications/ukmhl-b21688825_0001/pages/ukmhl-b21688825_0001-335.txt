The ferratus fuperior pofticus being raifed, the fplenii come into view ; and the fplenii being alfo lifted, the complexus is fully expofed. CXVIII. Splenius.â€”The two fplenii are fo named from their lying like furgical fplints along the fide of the neck; both together they have the appearance of the letter Y ; the complexus being feen betwixt them in the upper part of the angle. They lie immediately under the trapezii, and above the complexi. Each fplenius is a flat and broad mufcle, which arifes from the fpinous proceflfes of the neck and back, and is implanted into the back part of the head. It arifes from the four fpines of the back and the fiv e lower of the neck ; it parts from its fellow at the fifth vertebra of the neck, fo as to Ihow in the interface two or three of the uppermoft fpines of the neck, with the upper part of the complexus mufcle ; each fplenius goes obliquely outwards, to be inferted into the oc- cipital ridge, and all along to the root of the maftoid procefs. At the third vetebra of the neck, where the two fplenii mufcles part from each other, the tendons of the oppofite fplenii are clofely connected both with each other, and with the common tendon, which is called ligamentum nuchae.

411 LIGAMENTS, BURSiE, &C. all its circle, according to its degree of motion ; and thofe ligaments are of the fame nature with the firfl or burfal ligaments; arife, like them, from the periofteum chiefly; or indeed are truly but a thickening of the burfal ligament at certain points. The univerfal connexion of thefe parts is now fuf- ficiently explained, fince we have followed the feveral forms of cellular fubftance: ift, Clothing the bones with a think membrane, which, though infenfible, and almoft inanimate in its own nature, conveys blood- veflels, the means of life, to the bones, and is named periofteum: adly, The fame periofteum, thickened and ftrengthened by the adhefion of furrounding parts, fo as to form the capfules for the joints: 3dly, The tendon, alfo continued from the periofteum, and not growing from the mufcle, but merely joined to it: 4thly, we fee that fmaller tendon, expanded into a thinner tendinous fheet, as in the brawn of the leg where the ham-ftrings (whofe expanfion ftrengthens the knee-joint) go down over the mufcles of thÂ« leg : 5thly, We fee the perpendicular partitions of this fafcia going down among the mufcles, and dividing them from each other; and the cellular fubftance, which lies under the fafcia, and immediately furrounds the mufcle, cannot be diftinguilhed from the inner furface of the fafcia itfelf: 6thly, And as for the burfae, we fee that they are formed wherever a tendon rubs over a bone. The upper furface of the burfa is formed by the tendon which rubs over the bone; the lower fur- face of the fame burfa is formed by the periofteum of fhe bone which it defends; the fides are formed by the common cellular fubftance. Its cavity appears to be .merely

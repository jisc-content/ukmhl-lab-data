MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C# 269 The its origin is at leaft two inches up the humerus, above the joint of the elbow. XCIII. The EXTENSOR CARPI RADIALIS LONGIOR. has the additional name of longior or primus, to diftin- guilh it from the next. It is almoft entirely covered with the laft mufcle, the fupinator. It arifes from the ridge of the humerus above the external condyle, and juft under the origin of the fu- pinator ; it defcends all along the back of the radius, and after having become a thick flefhy belly, it dege- nerates a little lower than the middle of the radius into a thin flat tendon, which becomes flender and fmail as it defcends; and turning a little more towards the back of the radius, it then pafles over the wrift ; and goes along with the tendon of the extenfor brevior, under the annular ligament, palling in a groove of the radius; at laft it is inferted into the root of the me- tacarpal bone of the fore-finger, in that edge next the thumb. It is chiefly an extenfor of the wrift: in pronation, it pulls the wrift directly backwards; in fupination, it moves the hand fidewife. It is alfo a pronator when the hand is turned back to the greateft degree ; and from its origin, high upon the Ihoulder-bone, it is alfo a flexor of the fcre-arm. XCIV. Extensor carpi radialis brevior, This mufcle is almoft the fame in defcription, name, and ufe, with the former. It arifes from the external con- dyle; and here a common tendon for many mufcles ip formed, juft as in the internal condyle; for from this point arife the extenfor brevis, extenfor digitorum? extenfor minimi digiti, extenfor carpi ulnaris.

46 OE THE SKULL IN GENERAL.. the all the phenomena are not yet explained ; we find each future always in its appointed place : we find no- thing like a future formed betwixt the head and body of a long bone, though they are formed in diltindt points, and are not united till after the years of man- hood ; we find no futures when bones are broken and reunited ; when they have been fpoiled, and are repla- ced ; when a piece of fpoiled bone has been cut away ; or when a new fhaft of a bone is formed by the fe- creting veffels, and is united to the heads of the old bone. Thefe are accidents which hold us at lead; in doubt. It has been fuppofed, and with much appearance of truth, that the futures limit the extent of fractures ; leave a free communication of the internal with the external parts ;" that they muft ferve as drains from the brain ; that they are even capable of opening at times, fo as to give relief and eafe in the moft dreadful dif- eafes of the head. But I fear we are not yet able to fee the meaning of this peculiarity of flrudture; for the futures are regular and uniform to a wonderful degree, while thefe ufes of them are far from being proved. The futures furely were not intended by nature for limiting the extent of fradtures : for fradtures tra- verfe the fkull in all directions ; crofs the futures with eafe; and very often palling all the futures, defcend quite to the bafis of the Ikull, where we dare not fol- low them with the knife, nor apply the trepan. In- deed we do not even know that limiting the extent of fradtures could be a gracious provifion of nature, fince it would rather appear by the common accidents, that the more eafily the bone yields, the lefs is the injury to

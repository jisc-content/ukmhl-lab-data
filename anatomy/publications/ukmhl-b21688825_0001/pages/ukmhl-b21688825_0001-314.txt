27® MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. The extenfor carpi radialis brevior arifes from the outer condyle of the humerus, by the common ten- don ; it alfo arifes from the aponeurofis, which lies be- twixt the ext.nfor digitorum and this; it grows a pretty large flefhy belly, and begins like the laft to be tendinous below the middle of the radius ; fo that this mufcle continues fleftry, lower than the laft one* Its tendon is alfo much larger and thicker; it runs under the annular ligament, in the fame channel with the extenfor longior ; it expands a little before its in- fertion, which is into the fore-part of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, a little towards that edge, which is next to the radius: Some little fibres pafs from this tendon to the metacarpal bone of the fore- finger. ' All that was faid concerning the extenfor Iongus may be faid of this; for all the three laft mufcles lie fo ambiguoufly on the edge of the arm, that though they are regularly fupinators and extenfors, they become pronators and flexors in certain pofitions of the hand. XCV. Extensor carpi ulnaris.—By the name merely of this mufcle we know its extent and courfe, its origin, infertion, and ufe. It is one of the mufcles which belong to the com-, mon tendon, arifing from the external tubercle of the os humeri: It lies along the ulnar edge of the arm ; it arifes alfo from the intermufcular membrane, which feparates this from the extenfor digitorum and the extenfor digiti minimi; and chiefly it is attached to the internal furface of the common fheath. It arifes alfo from the face and edge of the ulna the whole way down; its tendon begins in the middle of its length, and

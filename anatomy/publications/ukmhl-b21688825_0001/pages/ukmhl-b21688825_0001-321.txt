MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 2^/ feathered with fibres in an oblique direction down to the ligament of the wrift. This mufcle lies under the extenfor communis digi- torum ; its tendon paffes along with the common ten- don, through the annular ligament; and near the top of the metacarpal bone, or about the place of the com- mon jundions of all thefe tendons, this one joins with the indicator tendon of the common extenfor. Its ufe is to extend all the three joints of the fore- finger, affi fling the common extenfor to point with that finger, to ad independently of the common ex- tenfor, and to help to extend the wrift when the fin- gers are clofed. CII. The supinator brevis is an internal mufcle, which forms, with the mufcles of the thumb, of the fore-finger, and mid-finger, a kind of fecond layer j and this one lies concealed, much as the pronator quadratus does, on the inner fide of the fore-arm. It is a fhort mufcle, but very thick and flefhy, and of great power. It arifes from the outer tubercle of the os humeri, and from the edge of the ulna, and from the interof- feous ligament: it is then lapped over the radius, and is inferted into its ridge; fo that this fupinator brevis is very diredly oppofed to the pronator teres, the in- fertion of the two mufcles almoft meeting on the edge of the radius, it is almoft circumfcribed to one ufe, that of performing the rotation of the radius outwards; but perhaps it may alfo have fome little effect in ex- tending the ulna and in affifting the anconeus.

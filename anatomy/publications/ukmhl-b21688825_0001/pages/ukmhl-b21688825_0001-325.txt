MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C- 201 fore this mufcie and the next, which lies clofe upon it, may be fazrly confidered as but two different heads of one thick fhort mufcie. CV. The flexor brevis pollicis is a two-headed mufcie, placed quite on the infide of the thumb, be- twixt the fore-finger and the thumb, and extends ob- liquely acrofs the two firfl metacarpal bones. It is divided into two heads by the long flexor of the thumb. The edge of this mufcie lies in clofe contact with the edge of the laft, or opponens; and indeed they may fairly be confidered as one large mufcie furround- ing the bafis of the thumb. One head arifes from the os trapezium or bafe of the thumb, and from the ligament of the wrift. The other head comes from the os magnum, from many of the other bones of the carpus, and from the liga- ments which unite them. The firfl head is the fmaller one ; it terminates by a pretty confiderable tendon in the firfl fefamoid bone. The fecond head runs the fame courfe : it is implant- ed chiefly in the fecond fefamoid bone, and alfo into the edge of the firfl bone of the thumb clofe by it. The fecond head is exceedingly mufcular and ftrong : the heads are completely feparated from each other by the tendon of the flexor longus palling betwixt them. The office of this mufcie is to bend the firfl joint upon the fecond, and the metacarpal bone upon the carpus: and indeed the office of this, and of the op- ponens, is the fame. It is in the tendons of this double-headed mufcie that the fefamoid bones are /buntj. CVI. The

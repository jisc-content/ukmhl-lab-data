MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. 361 caufe they arife in one common point, the tuber ifchii, and that point is very far diflant from the centre of motion. There is ftill cne finall mufcle, a flexor of the leg, which performs this rotation during the bent flate of > the knee with moil particular power. CLXXIX. TheMuscuLus poplit^eus, which isfo named from its lying in the ham, is a fmall triangular mufcle, lying acrofs the back part of the knee-joint, very deep under the hamftrings, and under the muf- cles of the leg. Its origin is from the outer condyle of the thigh- bone, and from the back part of the capfule of the joint. Its tendon is Ihort and thick, but of no great extent. It paflfes flefhy behind the knee-joint; and it is inferted broad into a ridge on the back part of the tibia ; fo that by its fmall origin and broad infertion it is a fan-like mufcle ; its fibres being almoft tranfverfe, and its lower fibres nearly perpendicular. Befides bending the leg, it is ufeful by pulling afide the cap- fule to prevent its being catched. CLXXX. The biceps cruris, fo named from hav- ing two heads, a long and Ihort one, lies immediately under the fkin, in the back part of the leg, running down from the pelvis to the knee, to form the outer hamfiring. It is the fingle flexor on the outfide of the thigh. Its origin is from the outer part of the tuber ifchii by a tendon of an inch and a half in length. And this tendon is, in its origin, clofely united with that of the femitendinofus for two inches, or at leafl the whole length of the tendon. After a Ihort, but very thick flefhy

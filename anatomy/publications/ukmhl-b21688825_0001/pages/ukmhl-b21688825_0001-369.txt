I y 3 ' line AND OF THE DIAPHRAGM. 325 from the ligamentum arcuatum: and, in fhort, from all the borders of the cheft, from the xiphoid carti- lage quite round to the vertebrae of the loins. 2. The LESSER muscle of the DIAPHRAGM, which arifes from the fpine, begins by four fmall flender ten- dinous feet on each fide. The firft of thefe, the long- eft one, arifes from the fecond vertebra above the pel- vis : it goes from the flat fore part of its body, and ad- heres to the fore part of all the lumbar vertebras as it mounts upwards. The fecond rifes from the third vertebra, but farther out towards the fide of the ver- tebra. The third arifes from the fide of the fourth vertebra. And the fourth tendon of the diaphragm arifes from the tranfverfe procefs of the fame fourth vertebra of the loins. But indeed we ought, in place of this minute demonftration, to fay, that it arifes from the four uppermoft lumbar vertebra by four tendinous feet, flat and gliftening, and adhering clofely to the fliining ligament with which the bodies of the vertebra are ftrengthened; that thefe tendons foon join to form a ftrong round flelhy leg, which is called the crus diaphragmatis ; of which crura the left is the fmaller one; and that thefe crura, joining, mixing, and crofting their fibres, form a flelhy belly, the leflfer mufcle of the diaphragm. 3. The tendon in the centre of the diaphragm is determined in its lhape by the extent of thefe flelhy bellies; for the great mufcle above almoft furrounds the central tendon, The fmaller mufcle below meet ing it, the two divifions give it a pointed form be- hind ; the tendon has the figure of a trefoil leaf, or of the heart painted upon playing cards.

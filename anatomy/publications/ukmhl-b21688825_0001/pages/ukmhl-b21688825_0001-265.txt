LOWER JAW, THROAT, AND TONGUE. 221 The obferved by Cowper, and has been named by Innes stylo-hyoideus alter ; but it is not regular, nor has it ever been acknowledged as a diftindt mufcle. XL.The digastricus, or biventer maxillae in- feriors, is named from its having two bellies. One belly arifes from a rugged notch along the root of the maftoid procefs, where the flefh is thick and ftrong s going obliquely forwards and downwards, it forms a long tendon, round, thick, and very ftrong, which paf- fes by the fide of the os hyoides; and as it pafTes, it firft flips through the loop or noofe of the ftylo-hyoi- deus, and then is fixed by a tendinous bridle to the fide of the os hyoides; and then turning upwards to* wards the chin, it ends in a fecond flefhy belly, which, like the firft, is flat, and of a pyramidal fhape, lying above the mylo-hyoldeus. Though this mufcle is often called biventer maxillse inferioris, as belonging to the lower jaw, perhaps it does more regularly belong to the throat. No doubt, when the os hyoides is fixed by its own mufcles from the fhoulder and fternum, the digaftricus muft act on the jaw; an office which we cannot doubt, fince we often feel it taking a hidden fpafin, pulling down the chin with fevere pain and diftortion of the neck. But its chief office is to raife the os hyoides ; for when the jaw is fixed, as in fvvallowing, the railing of the os hy- oides pulls up the throat j and this is the true mean- ing of its pafling through the noofe of the ftylo-hyoi- - deus, and of its connexion with the fide of the os hy- oides. Then the digaftric and ftylo-hyoideus mufcles pull the throat upwards and backwards.

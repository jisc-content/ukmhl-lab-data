MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 2 55 Thefe mufcles are denominated from their ufes chiefly 9 but if two mufcles perform one motion, they may be dillinguiflied by fome accident of their fituation or form. And thus, if there be two benders of the fingers, one above the other, they are named flexor sublimis, and flexor profundus, i. e. the deep and the fuperficial flexors. If there be two flexors of the carpus, one is named flexor, radialis carpi, by its running along the radius; the other flexor ulnaris carpi, from pafiing along in the courfe of the ulna. And if there be two pronators, one may be dillinguiflied as the pronator teres, from its round Ihape, the other as the pronator quadratus,, from its fquare form. And this, I trull, will ferve as a key to what is found to be a fource of inextricable confufion. It will be eafy to make the origins ami infertions of thefe mufcles ftill more fimple than their names ; for all the mufcles arife from two points, and have but two ufes. This aflertion fhall be afterward.s qualified, with a few exceptions; but at prefent it lfiall Hand for the rule of our demonftration; for all the mufcles arife from two points, the external and the internal condyle. The internal condyle is the longer one, and giveA.mofl power; more power is required for bending, grafting, and turning the hand 9 therefore all the mufcles w.hich bend the hand, all the mufcles which bend the fingt^rs, and the pronator, or that which turns the palm dov. T&- wards, arife from the the internal condyle. 1 he external condyle is Ihorter ; it gives lefs power % there is little refiftance to the opening of the hand, and little power is required in extending the fingers 9 and

360 MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. gracilis, and femitendinofus, are implanted like one mufcle; and this tendinous expanfion feems like a capfule for enclofmg the heads of the tibia and femur, and for ftrengthening the knee-joint. The femitendi- nofus bends the leg. CLXXVIII. The semimembranosus has its name from the mufcle, which is flat, thick, and flefliy, begin- ning and ending with a flattened tendon, fomewhat like a membrane, but infinitely thicker and maflier than fuch a name fhould imply. It arifes from the tuber ifchii, before the femitendi- nofus and biceps. It arifes a broad, thin, and flat ten- don, of about three inches in length. It becomes flefliy and thick in its middle, but it foon becomes thinner again, and terminates in a fliort tendon, which, gliding behind the head of the tibia, is inferted there *â€¢. This mufcle has little connexion with any other. It lies under, or, more properly fpeaking, on the infide of the femitendinofus, and the two together form the hamftrings. The hamftring. mufcles contribute alfo to another motion. Though, when extended, the tibia cannot roll, yet when we fit with our knees bent, it can roll flightly; and fuch rolling is accom- plifhed by thefe mufcles. All thefe mufcles which bend the leg, and which confequently extend the thigh at the fame time, are mufcles of very great power $ be- * The two tendons of this mufcle, the membranous tendon at the head, and this fmaller one by \\ hich it is inferted, Hand fo obliquely, that the mufcular fibres betwixt them mult be very oblique ; for the membranous tendon defcends low upon the back part or edge, and the tendon of infertion begins high upon the fore edge of the mufcle. caufe

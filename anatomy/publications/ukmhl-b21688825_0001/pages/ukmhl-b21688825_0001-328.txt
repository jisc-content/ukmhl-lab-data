284 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. The interroflei are fituated betwixt the metacarpal bones. They are fmall, round, and neat, fomething like the lumbricales in lhape and fize. Three are found in the palm, which hend the fingers, and draw their edges a little towards the thumb ; four are found on the back of the hand, for extending the fingers. CXI. The interossei interni arife from betwixt the metacarpal bones. They are alfo attached to the fides of thefe bones. They fend their tendons twilling round the fides to the backs of thefe bones; and they are inferted along with the tendons of the lum- bricales and extenfors into the back of the finger. They are thus flexors of the firfl: joint, and extenfors, of the fecond joint, as the lumbricales are. CXII. The interossei externi are four in num, ber. They arife, like the interni, from the metacarpal bones and their interftices, and from the ligaments of the carpal bones. They are peculiar in having each two heads, therefore named interoflei bicipites. They join their tendons to thofe of the extenfor and lumbri- cales : they have therefore one common office with them ; that is, extending all the joints of the fingers. Many have chofen to defcribe the origin and infertion with mod particular care, marking the degree of obli- quity, and ascertaining precifely their office, and giv- ing particular names to each, as prior indices for the firft external: all which I forbear mentioning, becaufe they mull be more liable to perplex than likely to aflift the ftudent: if we but remember their common place and office, it is enough. The tendons of the flexor mufcles bend round the finger, along with the interofiei and lumbricales, for a furer hold; confequent- 14 ty

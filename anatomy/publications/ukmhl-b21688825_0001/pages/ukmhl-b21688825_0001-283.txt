MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 239 external abdominal mufcle. The fibres approach each other till they form a flat tendon about an inch in j , breadth; and as the fibres approach each other, they crofs in fuch a way, that the lower edge of the mufcle forms the upper edge, of the tendon, which is ftill flat, but twilled: its implantation is into the edge, if I may call it fo, of the groove or rut which is in the flioulder bone for receiving the biceps tendon. That part which arifes from the clavicle is a little feparated from that which arifes from the flernum; a fatty line makes the diflindtion; and they are fometimes described as two parts: it is thofe two bundles chiefly which crofs each other to make the plaited appearance. The pec- toralis, among others, has been made a mufcle of re- fpiration *. LXX. the latissimus dorsi is the broadefl, not only of the back, but perhaps of the whole body. It is a beautiful mufcle, covering all the lower part of the back and loins, and reaching to the arm, to be the antagonist to the pectoral mufcle. It arifes by a broad, flat, and gliftening tendon, which covers all the loins, and which is in fome degree the root of other mufcles, especially of the longifflmus dorfi. This broad filvery tendon, begins exactly in the middle of the back; it arifes from the lowrer vertebra of the loins, * Haller tells us, that when at any time, he had rheumatism in this mufcle, his breathing was checked; and when he had difficult breathing, he found great relief by fixing the hands, raifing thq {boulders, and a&ing with the pedtoral mufcles. It feems confirmed by thefe fafts, that afthmatics take this pofture; "women in labour fix their arms by refting upon the arms of their chair; thofe who play on wind-inilruments raifethe fficulders in {training, &c. from

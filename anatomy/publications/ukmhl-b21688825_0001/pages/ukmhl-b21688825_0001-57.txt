and growth of bones. 13 the which conditutes the hardnefs, and all the ufeful pro- perties of bone, is dead, inorganized, and lies in the interfaces, of the bone; where it is united with mucus, to giye it confidence and drength; furnifhed with abforbents to keep it in health, and carry off its waff- ed parts; and pervaded by veffels to fupply it with new matter. The cartilage is itfelf a fecretion, to which the full fecretion of bone fucceeds, as the arte- ries grow dronger in their fecreting office: for in a broken limb there is fird a thin effudon, then a tremu- lous gelly, then radiated veffels, then offifying fpots, and thefe running together form perfect: bone. If the broken limb be too much moved during the cure, then the fecreting arteries are interrupted in their office; perfect bone is never formed; it remains a cartilage ; and an unnatural joint is produced : but we cut the furface of thefe cartilages, and then the veffels are opened again, the procefs is renewed, and the bones unite : or even by rubbing, by dimulat- ing, by merely cutting the furrounding parts, the veffels are made a&ive, and their fecretion is renewed. During all the procefs of offification, the abforbents proportion their adtion to the dimulus which is applied to thern they carry away the ferous fluid, when gelly is to take its place; they remove the gelly, as the bone is laid; they continue removing the bony particles alfo, which (as in a circle) the arteries continually renew. Nothing can be more curious than this continual renovation and change of parts, even in the hard- eft bones. We are accudomed to fay cf the whole body, that it is daily changed ; that the old particles are removed ; and new ones fupply their place ; that

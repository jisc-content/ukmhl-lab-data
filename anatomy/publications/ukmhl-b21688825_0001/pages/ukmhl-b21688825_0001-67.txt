23 AND GROWTH OF BONES. the C 4 and it is eafily feen, during the growth of a young bone, that the inner and more delicate plates are fe- parating from the walls of the bone, and receding to- wards its cavity; and thefe plates, being again crofied by fmall bony partitions, form a net-work, or fpongy mafs, which fills the whole cavity of the bone. In the middle of the bone, the cavity is fmall, the walls are thick, and have all their bony plates ; the cells of net- work are few, and large: but towards the ends, the bone fwells out; the cavity alfo is large, but it is not like that in the middle, a large tubular cavity; it is fo crolfed with lattice-work, with fmall interfaces and cells, that it feems all one fpongy mafs of bone ; and fo many of the inner layers are feparated, to form this profufion of cells, that the whole fubftance of the bone has degenerated into this lattice-work, leaving only a thin outward Ihell *. This reticular form is what ana- tomifts call the cancelli, lattice-work, net-work, or alveolar part of the bone ; it is lined throughout with one delicate membrane ; and inward partitions of the fame lining membrane cover each divifion of the lat- tice-work, forming each ceil into a diftinft cavity. In thefe cavities or cells the marrow is fecreted. The fecretion is thin and bloody in children ; it thickens as we advance in years; it is a folid oil, or marrow, in the adult. The marrow is firmer, and more perfect in * That it is merely an expanfion of the layers that forms the cancelli, and a mere fwelling and fponginefs of the fame quantity of bony fubftance, that makes the ends fo much thicker than the middle, is proved by this, that an inch of the fmaller bony tube, cut from the middle, weighs equally with an inch of the large fpongy tube, cut out from the ends.

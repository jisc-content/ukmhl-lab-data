MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 257 LXXXII. The pronator teres radii is of the outermoft layer of mufcles, is fmall and round; named pronator from its office of turning the radius, and teres from its ffiape, or rather to diftinguifh it from the pronator quadratus, which is a ffiort fquare muf- cle which lies deep again, being laid flat upon the naked bones. The pronator teres arifes chiefly from the internal tubercle of the humerus, at its lower and fore part: it has a fecond origin from the coronoid procefs of the ulna. Thefe form two portions, betwixt which paffes the radial nerve. The mufcle thus formed is conical; is gradually fmaller from above down- wards ; is chiefly flefhy, but is alfo a little tendinous, both at its origin and at its infertion; and ft retches obliquely acrofs the fore-arm, palling over the other mufcles to be inferted in the outer ridge of the radius, about the middle of its length. Its ufe is to turn the hand downwards, by turning the radius; and it will alfo, in ftrong adtions, be brought to bend the fore-arm on the arm ; or the re- verfe, when the fore-arm is fixed, and we are to raife the trunk by holding with the hands. LXXXIII. The palmarjs lonc-us is a long thin mufcle, which although it feems to have another ufe in its expanfion into the aponeurofis ; yet is truly, by its infertion into the annular ligament of the wrift, a flexor of the wrift, and in fome degree, a pronator of the radius. It arifes from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and is the firft of five mufcles which have one common tendon, and which go out, like radii, from one com- voi.. iÂ» s mon

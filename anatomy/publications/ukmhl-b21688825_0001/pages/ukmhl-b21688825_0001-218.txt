bones op the r74â–  and flattened towards the lower end ; and this flatnefs makes the elbow-joint a mere hinge, moving only in one direction. It is again regular and round towards the upper end ; dilating into a large round head, where the roundnefs forms a very free and moveable joint, turning eafily in all directions. 1. The head of this bone is very large ; it is neat and regularly circular ; but it is a very fmall portion of a large circle, fo that it is flat: and this flatnefs of the head, with the fhallownefs of its glenoid cavity, makes it a very weak joint, eafily difplaced, and nothing equal to the hip-joint for fecurity and ftrength. 2. The neck of this bone cannot fairly be reckoned fuch ; for, as I have explained in fpeaking of the neck of the thigh-bone, this neck of the humerus and the necks of mofl bones (the thigh-bone Hill excepted), are merely a rough line ciofe upon the head of the bone, without any ftraitening or intermediate narrow- nefs, which we can properly call a neck. The roughs nefs round the head of the fnoulder-bone is the line in- to which the capfular ligament is implanted. The tuberosities of the os humeri are two fmall bumps of unequal flze (the one called the greater, the other the fmaller, tuberofity of the os humeri), which (land up at the upper end of the bone, juft behind the head: they are not very remarkable. Though much fmaller than the trochanter of the thigh-bones, they ferve fimilar ufes, viz. receiving the great mufcles which move the limb. The greater, tuberosity is higher towards the outer fide of the arm, and receives the fupra fpinatus mufcle; while the infra fpinatus and teres minor mufcles, which come

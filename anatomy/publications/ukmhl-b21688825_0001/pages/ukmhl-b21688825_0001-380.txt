MUSCLES OF THE THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT. MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. The mufcles belonging to the thigh-bone arife all from the pelvis or trunk. The psoas magnus and ili- acus internus come from within the pelvis,at its fore part, and, palling under the femoral ligament, go down to be implanted into the trochanter minor ; and by this obliquity of their infertion, they turn the toes out- wards, and bend the thigh. Other mufcles come from the lower and fore part of the pelvis; as the pe c t i n al i s, triceps,and obturator EXTERNus,which arife from the arch of the pubis, and go down to be implanted into the linea afpera, and lelfer trochanter; and they, pul- ling the thigh towards the body, are called the adduc- tors. Others arife from the facrum and back part of the pelvis, as the gluthli, which, coming direftly for- wards to be implanted into the greater trochanter, pull back the thigh ; and a fourth fet coming alfo from the internal furface of the pelvis, viz. the obdurator Internus,and thePYRAMiDALis,comeout through the back openings, turn round the pelvis as round a pul- ly, and roll the thigh, and draw it back.

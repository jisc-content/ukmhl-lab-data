And fo the trunk of the body, the arm, the thigh, the leg, are bound each with a ftrong, fmooth, and gliftening (heath, formed out of the cellular fubftance, condenfed and thickened by continual prelfure. And this alfo is thicker and ftronger according to the need that there may be for fuch a help j for it is weaker over the flat mufcles of the back or of the abdomen, ftronger on the arm, ftronger ftill over the ftrong mufcles of the thigh. It is hardly to be diftinguilhed in the child ; grows thick- er and ftronger as we advance in years and in ftrength, and in the arms of workmen it grows particularly thick and ftrong, increafing in the back, Ihoulder, or limbs, according to the particular kind of labour. Thefe are the membranes which, by incloftng the mufcles like (heaths, are called the vagina, or fascia of the arm, the leg, the thigh, &c. 4.

50 OF THE SKULL IN GENERALÂ» The futures of the cranium are accidental merely, and of little ufe. The refult, perhaps, of this-well- known law, that nature feeks to facilitate edification, by beginning the procefs in many points; and Ihe eftablilhes as many diftindt points, in healing a broken limb as in forming the Ikull. But however they may be formed, their ufes cannot be of that importance which has been fuppofed ; for there are twenty fepa- rate bones, and twenty futures in the face, where they can neither flop fradlures, nor ferve as drains, nor open fo as to give relief. But if the futures of the cranium have any thing peculiar and different from thofe of the face, in that, perhaps, their peculiar ufes may be found. We can- not pafs unnoticed their loofenefs and flexibility in the new born child; how wonderfully the head of the child is increafed in length, and reduced in breadth in the time of delivery, and how much this conduces to an eafy and happy labour. The moll eminent anatomifts have condefcended to remark, that in the various nations of Europe the head has various forms; which they aferibe to fo flight a prefiure as that which drefs, or even the poflure of the head, might produce. But how very far Vefalius was deceived in calculating thus, is eafily proved. The Turks, fays he, have their heads flattened by wearing the turban.

OF THE TRUNK. . 108 1. The body is the main part of the vertebra to which all the other procefles are to be referred; it is the centre of the fpine, and bears chiefly the weight of the body: It is large in the loins, where the weight of the whole refts upon it, and where the movements are rather free : It is fmaller in the vertebras of the back, where there is almofl: no motion and lefs weight; and in the vertebras of the neck, there is hardly any body; the vertebras being joined to each other chiefly by the articulating procefles. 2. The articulating process is a fmall projec- tion, Handing out obliquely from the body of the ver- tebra, with a fmooth furface, by which it is joined to the articulating procefs of the next bone ; for each vertebra has a double articulation; with that above and with that below. The bodies of the vertebrae are united to each other by a kind of ligament, which forms a more fixed, and rather an elaftic joining ; and they are united again by the articulating procefles ; which makes a very moveable joint of the common form. The articulating procefles are fometimes named ob- lique procefles, becaufe they (land rather obliquely. The upper ones are named the afcending oblique pro- cefles, and the two lower ones are named the inferior or defcending oblique procefles. 3. The spinous processes are thofe which project dire&ly backwards, whofe points form the ridge of the back, and whofe fharpnefs gives the name to the whole column. The body of each vertebra fends out two arms, which, meeting behind, form an arch or canal for the fpinal marrow; and from the middle of that arch, and oppofite to the body, the fpinous procefs projects.

OF THE TENDONS, 408 where tendons pafs over bones, or traverfe the joints, their force is concentrated into narrower bounds ; and long tendons are fixed to the ends of the mufcles to pull the bones: tnefe tendons were once believed to be but the collected fibres of mufcles, gathered into a more condenfed form ; by which condenfation their properties of feeling and motion were loft, while they became hard, white, and gliftening ; and it was be- lieved that parts which were flefhy in the' child be- came tendinous in the adult. But we know by the microfcope that the tendon is not truly continued from the flefti; that the fibres of the tendon and of the flefti are not in the fame line, the fibres of all penniform mufcles running into their tendon, in a direction more or lefs oblique; and good anato- rnifts have been able to feparate the tendon from the flefti, without any violence, and with the blunteft knives. Mufcles are irritable and have nerves j ten? dons are quite dead, have no vifible nerves, have nei- ther feeling nor motion, nor any endowment by which we fhould believe them to be allied to the living parts of the fyftem ; and many tendons, as the expanfion of the palmaris, may be unravelled into mere cellular fubftance, 5. The periosteum is merely a condenfation of the common cellular fubftance, formed in fucceflive layers: and the tendons are of the fubftance of the periofteum ; they mix with the periofteum, and are implanted into it. In differing a child, we tear up the perioft teum, along with tendons, and without hurting the bones; but in procefs of time, the periofteum, and confequently the tendons, are infeparably fixed to the bones*

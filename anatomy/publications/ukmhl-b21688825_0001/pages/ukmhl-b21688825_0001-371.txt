AND OF THE DIAPHRAGM. n>27 anatomifls have reckoned this a fort of fphindter for the upper orifice of the flomach. Thirdly, The great vena cava goes up from the abdomen to the heart, through the right fide of the diaphragm; and this hole being of a triangular form, being in the hard tendon, and larger than the vein requires, there is no danger of ftrangulation in the vein. The tendon is compofed of fibres which come from the various fafciculi of this mufcle, meet and crofs each other with a confufed interlacement, which Al- bums has been at much pains to trace, but which Haller reports much more fenfibly : â€œ Intricationes <{ varias et vix dicendteirregular and confufed, eroding chi fly at the openings, and efpecially at the vena cava, the triangular form of which feems to be guarded in a moll particular way. The lower furface of the diaphragm is lined with the peritonaeum or membrane of the abdomen; and the upper furface is covered with the pleura or mem- brane of the cheft. The hole for the vena cava is fo large that the peritonaeum and plura meet, and touch each other through this opening all round the vein. The chief ufe of the diaphragm is in breathing ; and in this office it is fo perfect, that though there be a complete anchylofis of the ribs (as has often happen- ed), the perfon lives and breathes, and never feels the lofs. The diaphragm is, in its natural flate, convex towards the thorax; when it afts, it becomes plain, the thorax is enlarged, and by the mere weight of the air the lungs are unfolded and follow the diaphragm. No vacuum is ever found betwixt the diaphragm and y 4 the

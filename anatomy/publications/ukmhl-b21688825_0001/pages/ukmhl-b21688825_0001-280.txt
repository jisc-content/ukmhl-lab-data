236 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. wards, viz. the pectoralis minor and the ferratus ma- jor anticus, lie upon the fore-part of the bread. LXVI. The serratus major anticus lies upon the fide of the chefl arifmg from the ribs ; and as the ribs have interfaces betwixt them, every mufcle ari- fmg from the ribs arifes by diflinfl portions from each rib. All fuch diftindt and pointed flips are named digitations, tongues, or ferrae, from their refembling the teeth of a faw ; and. every mufcle arifmg from the ribs mufl be a ferrated mufcle. The ferratus major anticus is that great and broad mufcle, the chief part of which lies under the fcapula; and nothing of which is feen but the flefhy tongues, by which it arifes from the fides of the ribs. It is all flefhy, and is of a confider- able breadth and fcrength : it arifes from all the true ribs, except the firft, and from three of the falfe ribs : its indigitations, of courfe, fpread all over the fide of the thorax like a fan : its upper indigitations lie under the pedtoralis major, and its lower indigitations are mixed with the beginning of the abdominal mufcles : its mid- dle indigitations are feen fpreading upon the fides of the thorax : it lies thick and flefhy under the fcapula, and is a part of that cufh'ion on which the fcapula glides : its fibres converge towards a narrower infer- tion ; and the mufcle ends thick and flefhy in the whole length of that line which we call the bafis of the fcapula, and is, as it were, folded round it; fo that this mufcle, which comes from before, is im- planted along with the rhomboides, which comes from behind. Perhaps, in difficult breathing, the fhoulder blade being raifed and fixed by its own mufcles, the ferratus major

MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 253 It is manifeftly defigned for the extenfion of the fore- arm, and has only that one fimple adtion. MUSCLES OF THE RADIUS, CARPUS, AND FINGERS.

This fafcia is faid to proceed from the fmall tendon of the biceps mufcle, though that were but a flender origin for fo great a web of tendon, which not only covers the furface of the mufcles but enters among their layers. This fafcia really begins in the fhoulder, and has an addition and an increafe of ftrength from every point of bone ; it is affifted by each tendon, becaufe the tendons and fafcia are of one nature over all the body, and its con- nection with the tendon of the biceps is quite of an- other kind from that which has been fuppofed. I would not allow that the biceps tendoQ. expands into the fafcia, but rather that the web receives the biceps tendon, which is implanted into it; and for this wife purpofe,

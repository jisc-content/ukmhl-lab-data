It is the zygomatic mufcle that marks the face with that line which extends from the cheek-bone to the comer of the mouth, and which is fo ftrong in many.

For this large flat mufcle, which forms in a manner, the walls of the cheek, arifes chiefly from the coronoid procefs of the lower jaw-bone, and partly alfo from the end of the alveoli or focket procefs of the upper jaw, clofe by the pterygoid procefs of the fphe- noid bone: it goes forwards with dired fibres to be implanted into the corner of the mouth : it is thin and flat, covers in the mouth, and forms the walls of the cheek, and is perforated in the middle of the cheek by the dud of the parotid gland.

MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. 337 pletes the catalogue of thofe mufcles which move the thigh. 1. The PSOAS MAGNUS, ILIACUS INTERNUS, PEC- TINEUS, TRICEPS, OBTURATOR EXTERNUS, which, coming from before, are inferted into the leffer tro- chanter, and bend the thigh. 2. The GLUTiEI, GEMINI, PYRIFORM IS, OBTURATOR Internus,and quadp„atus, which come from behind, are implanted into the great trochanter, and extend the thigh; and it hardly need be remembered, that as, when the arms being fixed, their mufcles raife the weight of the body, as in climbing or in turning over a bar, by grafping with the hands ; fo the muf- cles of the thigh move that thigh only which is loofe and free from the weight of the body, while the mufcles of the other thigh, which is fixed by the weight of the body, move not the thigh, but the trunk upon the thigh ; fo that our walking is performed not fo much by the mufcles of the thigh moving the limb, as by their moving the pelvis, i. e. rolling the trunk upon the limb.

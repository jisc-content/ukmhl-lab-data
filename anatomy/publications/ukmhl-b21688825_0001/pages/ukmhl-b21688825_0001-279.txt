MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &CÂ» 235 almoft be reckoned different portions of the fame. LXIII. Levator scapula, named alfo levator proprius angular is, is a fmalLthin flip of flefh, which arifes from the four or five uppermoff vertebrae of the neck, at their tranfverfe procefles, by three or four, and fometimes five, diftmfl heads. The heads join to form a thin and fiat ffripe of mufcle, about three inches in breadth, which is fixed by a flat thin tendon to the upper corner of the fcapula, to pull it upwards, as in fhrugging the fiioulders *, whence it is named musculus patientije. LXIV. and LXV. The rhomboid muscle ftretches flat, neat, and of a fquare form, betwixt the fpine and the whole line of the bafe of the fcapula. One part arifes from the three lower fpinous procefles of the neck, and is implanted into the bafe of the fcapula at its upper part: then another portion arifes from the fpinous procefles of the firft four vertebrae of the back; runs exa&ly in the fame plane with the other into the bafe of the fcapula at its lower part: the part arifing from the three vertebrae of the neck is flightly divided from that which arifes from the four vertebras of the back, though not diftinctly, and often not at all. I would reckon this but one mufcle,/ but it has been commonly diftinguifhed into (LXIV.) the rhomboides minor, the uppermoft portion, and (LXV.) the rhomboides major, the lower portion. Thefe are feen after raifing the trapezius ; and the ufes of the trapezius, levator fcapulas, and rhomboides, are to raife the fcapula, or to carry it backwards. The mufcles which move the fcapula downwards and for- wards,

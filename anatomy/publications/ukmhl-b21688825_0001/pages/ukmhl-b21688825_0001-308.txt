264 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. the fublimis, a little belong the fecond joint of the fin- gers. At this place the perforating tendons are fmaller and rounder for their eafy pafiage; and after palling they again expand and become fiat. They alfo above this appear themfelves fplit in the middle, without any evident purpofe; they pafs the fecond phalanx, and are fixed into the root of the third. And every thing that is faid of the ufe of the fublimis may be applied to this, only that its tendons go to the furtheft joint. LXXXIX. Lumbricales.â€”I fhall here defcribe, as a natural appendage of the profundus, the lumbri- cales mufcles, which are four fmall and round muf- cles, refembling the earth-worm in form and fize; whence they have their name. They arife in the palm of the hand, from the tendons of the profundus, and are therefore under the fublimis, and under the palmar aponeurofis. They are fmall mufcles, with long and very delicate tendons. Their flefhy bellies are about the length of the metacarpal bones, and their fmall tendons ftretch over two joints, to reach the middle of the fecond phalanx. The firfi lumbricalis is larger than the fecond, and'the two firfi: larger than the two laft. The firfi arifes from the fide of the tendon of the fore-fingers, which is next to the radius; the others arife in the forks of the tendons; and though they rife more from that tendon which is next the ulna, yet they have attachments to both. Their tendons begin below the firfi; joint of each finger; they run very flender along the firfi phalanx, and they gradual- ly wind around the bone; fo that though the mufcles are in the palm of the hand, the tendons are implant- ed

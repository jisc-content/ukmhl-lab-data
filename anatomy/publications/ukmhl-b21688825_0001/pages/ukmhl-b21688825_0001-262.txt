MUSCLES OF THE 2l8 the jaws, gullet, and tongue ; and which, though they are inferted into the larynx, have more relation to fwallowing, or the motions of the gullet, than to breathing, or to the motions of the windpipe. The mufcles which pull the throat down are thefe : XXXIV. The sterno-hyoideus, which paffes from the fternum to the os hyoides; a fiat broad riband- like mufcle, which arifes from the upper piece of the flernum, rather within the breaft; and partly alfo from the clavicle and cartilage of the firfl rib; goes flat and fmooth along the forepart of the throat; mounts,â€˜nearly of the fame breadth, to the os hyoides ; and is implanted into its bafis, or that part (which in refembling the os hyoides to the jaw) we fhould com-* pare with the chin. XXXV. The sterno-thyroideus, which paffes in like manner from the fternum to the thyroid cartilage, is like the laft, a flat fmooth riband-like mufcle ; ra- ther thicker and more flefhy, but very uniform in its thicknefs. As the thyroid cartilage is below the os hyoides, the fterno-thyroid mufcle muff lie under the fterno-hyoideus mufcle. It arifes under the fterno-hy- oideus mufcle from the fternum and cartilage of the rib; and is implanted Tffo the rough line of the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage, ana t0 one hde, but not fo much as is reprefented in Cowper?s draw- ings. It immediately covers the thyroid gland; and the way to the trachea for piercing it in performing bronchotomy is in the middle betwixt thefe mufcles. XXXVI. The omo-hyoideus, which was once named coraco-hyoideus being thought to arife from the co- racoid procefs. It is a mufcle of great length, and very

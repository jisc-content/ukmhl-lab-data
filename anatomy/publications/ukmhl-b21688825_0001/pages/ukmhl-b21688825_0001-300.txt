2^6 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. fo all the mufcles which extend the wrifl: or the fingers, or roll the hand outwards to turn it fupine, arife from the external condyle. So that when we hear a pronator or a flexor named, we know that the origin mufl be the internal condyle, and the infertion is exprefled by the name : thus a pro- nator radii is a turner of the radius, and goes to the radius ; a flexor carpa goes to the wrifl; a flexor digi- torum goes to the fingers ; and a flexor pollicis goes to the thumb : All the flexors, and all the pronators, iflue from that point as from a centre. And, again, when a fupinator or an extenfor is named, we know where to look for it; for they alfo go out from one common point., the external condyle; and the fupi- nator radii go es to the radius; the extenfor carpi goes to the wriflthe extenfor pollicis goes to the thumb; and the extenfor indicis to the fore-finger. flexors. The muscles clofing and bending the hand arife from tlae internal condyle. They are, Th e pronator teres radii, turning fhe radius. Palmaris longus, -n Flexor carpi radialis, C bending the wrifl.

And laftly, there is the pronator quadratus, which is the Tingle mufcle out of that fcheme which I have propofed; lying flat upon the interoffeous mem- brane near the wrifl. LXXXII.

So that the character of thefe cervical vertebrae is, that they are calculated for much free motion: and the marks by which they are diftinguilhed are, that the bodies are particularly fmall; the articulating pre- cedes bblique, with regard to their pofition, and almoft plain on their furface; the fpinous procefs, which is awanting in the uppermoft vertebra, is fhort and fork- ed in all the lower ones ; the tranfverfe procefs alfo is forked; and the tranfverfe proceffes of all the verte- bras, except perhaps the firft, are perforated near their extremities w'ith the large hole of the vertebral artery. ATLAS AND DENTATUS.â€”-But among thefe vertebrae of the neck, two are to be particularly dif- tinguifhed, as of greater importance than all the reft; for though the five lower vertebrae of the neck be of- fified and fixed, if but the two uppermoft remain free, the head, and even the neck, feems to move with per- fect eafe. The firft vertebra is named atlas, perhaps, be- caufe the globe of the head is immediately placed up- on it; the fecond is named dentatus or axis, becaufe it has an axis or tooth-like procefs upon which the firft turns. The atlas has not the complete form of the other vertebrae of the neck, for its proceffes are fcarcely dif- tinguifhable: It has no body, unlefs its two articulat- ing proceffes are to be reckoned as a body : It is no vol. 1. 1 more

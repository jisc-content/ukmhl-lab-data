To form this joint, the humerus has a large round and flattened head; the cavity of the fcapuia *, which receives this head, is oval or triangu- lar, fmall and very (hallow : it is eked out with a thick cartilaginous border, which increafes the hollow of the focket; but dill it is fo (hallow that the humerus can- not be fo much faid to be lodged in the glenoid cavi- ty, as to be laid upon it. Its capfule or bag is very loofe and wide, coming from the edges of the glenoid cavity, and implanted round the neck of the bone* The joint is richly bedewed with mucus; or rather with a mixed fecretion, which is partly fecreted by a fimbriated organ, confiding of lacunae or bags, the common organ for this fecretion through all the joints, and by a thinner exudation from thofe extreme ar- teries, which terminate, with open mouths, upon the internal furface of the bag. By the (hallownefs of its focket, and the largenefs of its head ; by the loofenefs of its capfule ; by all the forms and circumdances of its dructure;â€”the (hmi! - der is exceedingly loofe, and very liable to be difpla- ced : it has this loofe dru&ure and fuperficial focket, that its motions may be free ; but feldom is there any great advantage gained in the human body without a counterbalance of weaknefs and danger ; and every where in the limbs we obferve that a joint is weak and * It is called glenoid cavity from the Greek name of a joint, 3nd the name is not abfolutely appropriated to the fcapuia. 13 liable

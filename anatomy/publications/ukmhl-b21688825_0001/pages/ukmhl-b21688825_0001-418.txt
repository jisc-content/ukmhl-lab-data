MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES. 374 tendon fixes itfelf by the two forks to each fide of the fecond bone or phalanx of the toe. Its life is to bend the firfl: and fecond joints of the toes, but moil peculiarly the fecond. And the obli- quity of the long flexor is exactly balanced by a cor- refponding obliquity of the fliort flexor: for the ten- don of the long flexor coming round the inner circle, runs obliquely outwards to reach the toes ; while the fhort flexor coming from the heel, which is towards the outer edge of the foot, runs in a like degree obliquely inwards, and meets the other at an acute angle near the toes. CXCII. The lumbricales mull be differed after the fliort flexor. They need no defcription, fmce they exactly correfpond with thofe of the hand. They rife like them in the forks of the extenfor tendons. They, like them, pafs through the digitations of the aponeurofis. They pafs on to the firfl; bone of the toes, and, like the lumbricales of the hand, creep over the convexity of the bone, to be united along with the tendons of the extenfors. Their infertion is al- ways at the fide of the toe next the great toe; and their ufe is to bend the firfl; joint of the toes, and to draw them towards the great one, making an arch in the foot, and aflifting the tranfverfalis pedis. The ex- tensor brevis lies mod fuperficially upon the foie of the foot, having its origin from the inner furface of the aponeurofis. The mass a carnea lies deeper, having no origin but from the tip of the heel-bone, and being fcon implanted into the tendon of the long flexor. The. lumbricales again rife from the tendons of the long flexor, beginning juft where the mafia carnea ends in it'*

JOINTS OF THE 4 3s The carpal bones are connected with each other fo very clofely, that the name of joint can hardly be ufed. They are rather fixed than jointed together. Each bone has four fmooth articulating furfaces, by which it is united to the adjoining bones. The firft two bones form the great ball of the wrift; the fecond row again is united with the firft by a fort of ball and loc- ket ; for the os magnum, which is the central bone of the fecond row, has a large round head, which is re- ceived into the lunated hollow of the os lunare, which is the central bone of the firft row. The firft row is thus united to the fecond by a diftindl and general capfule; in addition to which each fingle bone is tied to the next adjoining, by a regular capfular ligament within, and by flat crofs ligaments without, or rather by many bundles of ligaments, which crofs each other in a very complicated manner; and the little flat and lhining fafciculi give the whole a radiated or ftar-like form *. The metacarpal bones are alfo joined to the carpal in one row, by a line of joints which are as one joint; befides their common capfule, the metacarpal of each finger has its peculiar ligaments proceeding in a radi- ated or ftar-like form from the carpal bones, and going out broad upon the metacarpal bones; and fo nume- rous, that each metacarpal bone is fecurely tied by li- * Thefe are the ligaments which are really fo unimportant to the anatomift or to the furgeon, but which are fo laborioully defcribed under the titles of ligamenta brevia, obliqua transnersa- ria,and propria ossium carpi; for they do in fadt crofs and travcrfe the carpus in every poffible direction. gaments

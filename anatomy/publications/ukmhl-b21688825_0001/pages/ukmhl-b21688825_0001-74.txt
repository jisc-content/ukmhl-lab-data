OF THE FORMATION 3° grees of feeling and circulation. We fee, that where even the lowefl of thefe, the bone, is deprived of its fmall portion of life, it becomes a foreign body, and is thrown off from the healthy parts, as a gangrened limb is feparated from the found body ; and we fpeak as familiarly of the death of a bone, as of the gangrene of foft parts. How, then, fhould we deny organization and life to the cartilages, though furely, in refpect of feeling they mull Hand in the very laft degree ? The periofteum goes from the bone over the furface of the cartilage alfo, where it is named perichondrium : It ftill preferves its own vafcular nature; the veffels can be inje&ed ; and it is not to be believed that the perichondrium has thefe velfels, without communica- ting them to the cartilage to which it belongs. We fee red arteries in the centre of an offifying cartilage j and therefore we know that the trunk of the artery may be red, as in the offifying part of the cartilage, and yet the extremity of the fame artery be pellucid, as in the unoffified part. Since veffels run through the cartilage to generate bone, We cannot in reafon, fuppofe that thefe veffels are produced in the inftant in which they appear : They had exifted before ; they are but dilated now ; the increafmg a&ion dilates them, and the dilatation makes them red : this enables them to fecrete bone, and, in many cafes, as in the acciden- tal joint formed by a fra&ure ill cared for, we can, by paring the cartilage, fet the veffels free again, and make them begin to fecrete. Wherever we find a vafcular membrane furround- ing and nourifhing any part, as the vitreous or cry- fhlline humours in the eye, we muff not fuppofe - 4 • that

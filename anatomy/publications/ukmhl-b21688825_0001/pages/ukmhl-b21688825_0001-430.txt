OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. 386 Then why fhould we define a mufcle by that acci- dental property which it fo often wants, and of which it may be fo eafdy deprived ; while we may define it more truly by its contraCtile power, the only evidence of its nature, and its chief diftinfition in the fyflem ? for the contraction of the iris conflitutes its nature ; it is a mufcle by truer marks than by its colour : and, by the fame rule, the mufcles of the leaft infeCt are as perfeCt as the mufcles of a man. Philofophers of the laft age had been at infinite pains to find the ultimate fibre of mufcles, thinking to dif- cover its properties in its form ; but they faw juft in proportion to the glades which they ufed, or to their practice and fkill in that art, which is now almoft for- faken. Some found the fibres to be of one equal fize in all creatures, however various : Others found them proportioned to the fize, or age, or ftrength, of their fubjeCt: but even fuch difcrepancies are trivial to thofe which, in one of the greateft of thefe minute philofophers, are found almoft in the fame page ; fome- times affirming the ultimate fibre to be greater or fmaller, according to the ftrength of the fubjeCt, and again making them of equal fize in the whale and in the infeCt. Others, lefs troubled about the ultimate fize of thefe fibres, have conceived notions of their form, which, in the credulity of the times, rofe into the importance of doCtrines; and, from the firft raw conceptions of their authors, were finally proved by the microfcope forfooth ; and while one author was drawing his rhom- boidal fibres all conjoined in regular fucceflion, and another defcribing them alfo from the microfcope as confiding

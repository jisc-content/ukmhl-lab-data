But it is a mufcle employed more in exprefling paflions than in performing ufe- ful motions; and it is often fo thin as hardly to be perceived. In fome it is entirely awanting ; and many who have the mufcle, have no command nor power over it. There is a final), neat, and pointed flip of the oc- cipito-frontalis, which goes down with a peak towards the nofe, and is inferted into the fmall nafal bone. This procefs, being much below the end of the eye- brow, muff pull it downwards ; fo that while the great mufcle raifes the eyebrow and fldn of the forehead, this fmall nafal flip pulls the eyebrow downwards again, reftoring it to its place, and fmoothing the fldn. It may be confidered as the antagonifl: of the great occipital and frontal bellies, and might almoft be defcribed as a diflinck mufcle. II. The corrugator super-CIlii is another flip which might be fairly enough referred, like this, to the occipital mufcle; but being in many fubjects parti- cularly ftrong, it is belt defcribed as diftinct. The lower end of the nafal flip of the occipito-frontalis is fixed to the nafal bone ; the lower end of the little flip, the corrugator fupercilii, is fixed into the internal an- gular procefs; and from the inner angle of the eye, the fibres fweep round the edge of the orbit, and going obliquely upwards and outwards, are fo mixed with the fibres of the frontal mufcle, and of the orbicularis vol, i. o oculi,

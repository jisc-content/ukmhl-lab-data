240 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. from the fpines and knobs of the back of the facrum, and from the back part of the circle of the os ilium : this laft is the only part that is flefhy. The fiat ten- don gradually pafies into a fiat and regular mufcle, which wraps round the fide of the body ; and as it lies over the corner of the fcapula, it receives a fmall flefhy bundle from it; and as it pafies over the lower ribs, it has fome tendinous flips fent into it, by which it is attached to the ribs. Its fibres converge : for the lower ones afcend ; the upper ones go direftly acrofs. And thefe different orders, not only meet to form its flat tendon, but they crofs each other, like thofe of the peftoral mufcle. Here alfo the tendon is twilled, and the upper edge of the mufcle forms the lower edge of the fiat tendon; which pafling into the axilla, turns under the arm-bone, and is implanted into it, on the inner edge of the bicipital groove. So the tendons of the peftoralis and latiflimus meet each other ; they in fad join face to face, as if the one tendon ended direclly in the other j and both united make a fort of lining for the groove, or a tendinous fheath for the long tendon of the biceps to run in. Thefe two mufcles form the axilla or arm-pit; and although each has its peculiar offices, their chief operation is when they coincide in one aflion; and that aftion is exceedingly powerful, both by the great ftrength of either mufcle, and by their being implant- ed into the arm b°ne four inches below the head. The peftoralis major is for pulling the arm forwards, as in laying the arms acrofs the br£afl, or in carrying loads in the arms: and it forms the border of the axilla

28 OF THE FORMATION The periofteum, which was once referred to the dura mater, is merely condenfed cellular fubftance; of which kind of matter we now trace many varied forms and ufes; for, fo clofe is the connexion of the peri- ofteum, tendons, ligaments, fafcite, and burfas, and fo much are thefe parts alike in their nature and proper- ties, that we reckon them but as varied forms of one common fubftance, ferving for various ufes in different parts. The periofteum confifts of many layers, accu- mulated and condenfed one above another : it adheres to the body of the bone by fmall points or proceffes, which dive into the fubftance of the outer layer, giving a firm adhefion to it, fo that it may bear the pulling of the great tendons, which are fixed rather into the peri- ofteum, than into the bone *. It is alfo connected with the bone, by innumerable veffels. It is not in itfelf vafcular; but it is the medium by which veffels are tranfmitted to the bone ; and our injections do not eafily colour the periofteum itfelf, while they make the bone which belongs to it thoroughly red. The layers of the periofteum neareft to the bone, are condenfed and ftrong, and take a ftrong adhefion to the bone, that the veffels may be tranfmitted fafely, and the fibres of this inner layer follow the longitudinal directions of the bony fibres. The periofteum is loofer in its tex- ture outwardly, where it is reticulated and lax, chan- ging imperceptibly into the common cellular fubftance. There the fibres of the periofteum affume the direc- * It would appear that the arteries are convertible through time into thefe tooth-like proceffes, by which the periofteum is fixed into the bone ; for in youth, the veffels are numerous, the adhefion flight, and the reparation bloody ; but in the older fubjeft, the feparation is more difficult, and lefs blood is feen. tions

MUSCLES OF THE -M2 from their origin in the pterygoid precedes of the fphu- hoid bone. The pterygoideus internets is that one which rifes from the internal or flatter pterygoid procefs, and which goes downwards and outwards to the angle of the jawon its infide. ThePTERYGOiDEUsEXTERNUs arifes from the external pterygoid procefs; and goes not downwards, but almoft diredtly outwards, and is im- planted high in the jaw-bone, juft under its neck, and connected with its capfular ligament. Now the pte- rygoideus internus defcending to be fixed to the angle of the jaw, is longer and bigger, and is named ptery- goideus major. The internal one going diredtly *â–  acrofs, and rather backwards, has lefs fpace to traverfe, is fhorter, and is named pterygoideus minor. The jaw is moved chiefly by thefe mufcles ; the tem- poralis acting upon the coronoid procefs like a lever ; the maflfeter adting upon the angle, and before it; and the pterygoideus internus balancing it within, like ah internal mafleter fixed to the infide of the angle. All thefe pull ftrongly upwards for biting, holding, and tearing with the teeth. And the external or lcflfer pte- rygoid mufcle going from within outwards, pulls the jaw from fide to fide, and performs all the motions of chewing and grinding, i. e. of rotation, fo far as tha lower jaw poflfeffes that kind of motion. MUSCLES OF THE THROAT AND TONGUE. The muscles of the throat and tongue cannot be underflood without a previous acquaintance with certain cartilages and bones, which form the bafis of the throat and tongue, and the centre of thofe motions which we haA e next to defcribe.

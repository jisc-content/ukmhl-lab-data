64 DESCRIPTION OF THE mofi lobes of the brain ; the two lower ones are under the tentorium, and hold the lobes of the cerebellum or little brain. Processes. The proceffes or projections of the oc- cipital bone are few and Ample. 1. There is a part of the bone which runs forward from the place of the foramen magnum; lies in the very centre of the bafe of the Ikull; and joins the occipital to the fphenoidal bone ; and which, both on account of its place (wed- ged in the bafis of the Ikull), and of its fhape, which is rather fmall, and fomewhat of the form of awvedge, is named the cuneiform, or wedge-like process of the occipital bone. And, 2. There are two fmall oval proceffes, or button-like projections, which (land off from the fide, or rather from the forepart of the fora- men magnum, or great hole, and which, being lodged in joints belonging to the upper bone of the neck, form the hinge on which the head moves. Thefe two pro- ceffes are named the condyles of the occipital bone- They are not very prominent, but rather flattened j are of an oval form, and have their fore-ends turned a little towards each other; fo that by this joint the head moves directlv backwards or forwards, but can- not turn or roll. The turning motions are performed chiefly by the firfl bones of the neck. Round the root of each condyle, there is a roughnefs, which fhows where the ligament ties this fmall point to the corre- fponding bone of the neck. Holes.â€”1. Thefe condyles ftand juft on the edge of the foramen magnum, or great hole of the head, which tranfmits the fpinal marrow, or continuation of the brain ; and the edges of this hole (which is almoft 5 a regu-

OP THE TRUNK. *3* The back of the facrum is alfo perforated with holes, whofe fize is nearly equal to thofe on its fore part, but whofe ufes are not fo diftinftly known ; for the final! nerves which pafs outwards by them to the mufcles of the loins or hips, are in no degree propor- tioned to the fize of the holes. All the edges of this triangle form articulating points, by which it is joined to other bones. The bafe, or upper part of the facrum, receives the laft vertebra of the loins on a large broad furface, which makes a very moveable joint j and indeed, the joining of the laft true vertebra, with the top of the facrum, is a point where there is more motion than in the higher parts of the fpine. The apex, or point of the facrum, has the os coccygis joined to it ; and this joining is moveable till the age of twenty in men, and till the age of forty-five in women:â€”the meaning of its continuing longer move- able in women is very plain, fince we diftinftly feel the lower point of the coccyx in women, yielding in the time of labour, fo as to enlarge greatly the lower opening of the pelvis. The fides of the os facrum form a broad, rough, and deeply indented furface, which receives the like rough furface of the haunch bones y and here the furfaees are fo rough, and the cartilage fo thin, that it refembles more nearly a future ; and by the help of the ftrong ligaments, and of the large mufcles which arife in common from either bone, makes a joining abfolutely immoveable, except by fuch violent force as is in the end fatal. Thus the original ftate of this bone is eafily recog- nifed and traced by many marks, it ftands in a confpi- cuous-

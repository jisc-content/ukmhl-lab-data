442 JOINTS OF THE motions of the joint. This mucous membrane, which keeps thefe fatty fringes orderly, has two or three fmall bridles in different directions ; whence they are named the ligamenta mucosa,or ligamentula mafias adipofae glandulofa; and this may be confidered as the conti- nued inflection of the fofter internal lamella of the cap- fule, which not only lines the focket, but is reflected over the central ligament, and over the globe of the thigh-bone, covering them alfo with a delicate mucous coat. Other fringes of the fame kind are found at the lower part of the joint, lying round the neck of the thigh-bone, near the angle where the capfular liga- ment is implanted into the root of the great trochanter : the liquor from thefe mucous fimbriae, with the gene- ral ferous exudations, are mixed and blended for lu- bricating the joint. This capfule, which is naturally the thickeft and ftrongeft in the body, almoft a quarter of an inch in thicknefs, is farther ftrengthened by many additions : for a flip of very ftrong tendinous or cellular fubltance condenfed comes down from the lower fpinous pro- cefs of the os ilium, and fpreads out over the capfule, and ftrengthens it very much on its fore part; the fmalleft of the glutasi mufcles adheres to the capfule and ftrengthens it behind ; the pfoas magnus and ilia- cus intemus pafs by the inner fide of the capfule; and though they do not abfolutely adhere to it, they de- pofit much cellular fubftance, which is condenfed fo as to ftrengthen the capfule, forming at the fame time a large burfa mucofa betwixt their tendinous fibres and the joint. That tendon of the reClus mufcle which comes from the margin of the focket, lies upon the outer

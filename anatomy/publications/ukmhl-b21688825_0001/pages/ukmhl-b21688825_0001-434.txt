39© OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. irritability is fo far independent of nerves, and fo little connected with feeling, which is the province of the nerves, that upon {Emulating any mufcle by touching it with a cauftic, or irritating with a {harp point, or driving the eleCtric fpark through it, or exciting with the metallic conductors, as of filver and zinc #, the mufcle inftantly contracts; although the nerve of that mufcle be tied; although the nerve be cut fo as to feparate the mufcle entirely from all connection with the fyftem; although the mufcle itfelf be feparated from the body ; although the creature upon which the experiment is performed may have loft all fenfe of feeling, and have been long apparently dead. Thus a mufcle cut from the limb trembles and palpitates for long after; the heart feparated from the body con- tracts when irritated ; the bowels, when torn front the body, continue their periftaltic motion, fo as to roll upon the table, ceafmg to anfwer to ftimuli only when they become ftiff and cold; and too often in the hu- man body the vis infita lofes the exciting power of the nerves, and then palfy enfues: or, loftng all go- vernance of the nerves, the vis infita, aCting without this regulating power, falls into partial and general con-, vulfions. Even in vegetables, as in the fenfitive plant* this contractile power lives. Thence comes the diftinc-. tion betwixt the irritability of mufcles and the fenfi- bility of nerves ; for the irritability of mufcles furvives the animal, as when it is aCtive after death ; furvives the life of the part, or the feelings of the whole fyftem., * See a moil ingenious differtation by my pupil Mr. Fowler, the firft writer, in this country, on this very interefting novelty, wher§ the operations of this new excitement are explained.

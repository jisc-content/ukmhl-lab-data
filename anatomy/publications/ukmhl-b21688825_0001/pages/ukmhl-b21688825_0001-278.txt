234 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. tendon from the moil pointed part of the occipital bone, and along the tranfverfe fpine quite to the maf- toid procefs; from this point all down the neck it has no hold of the vertebrae, but arifes from its fellow in a flrong tendon, which, extending like a bow-firing down the neck, over the arch of the neck, and not touching the vertebrae till it comes down to the top of the back, is named ligamentum nuch^e. The tendon begins again to take hold of the fpines of the two lafl vertebrae of the neck, and arifes from all the fpinous proceffes of the back downwards ; from this long origin, its fibres converge, as it were into one point, the tip of the Ihoulder: it alfo comes a little forward over the fide of the neck. It is implanted into one third of the clavicle neareft the Ihoulder ; into the tip of the acromion ; into the whole length of the fpine, from which the acromion rifes. And its fibres, arifing from along the neck and back, and converging almofl into a point, mull have various effects, according to the different fibres which act: for thofe which come downwards mull raife the fcapula; thofe which come from the middle of the back mull carry it diredly backwards ; thofe which come from the lower part of the back mull deprefs it; and thofe different fibres ading in fucceffion, mufl make the fcapula roll. The trapezius is chiefly a mufcle cf the fcapula, but it mufl be alfo occafionally a mufcle of the head, pulling the head backwards, and bending the neck. Three other mufcles which raife the fcapula, or carry it backwards, lie fo much in the fame plane, and are fo little divided from each other, that they might

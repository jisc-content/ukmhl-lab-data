AND OF THE DIAPHRAGM, 321 very thick and flrong in the lower animals, as in bulls, dogs, &c.; is eafily found in man, but not always, being fometiines thin and pale, and hardly to be known from the coats upon which it lies. It appears to grow more lie iky in old age, and to be thickened in enlargements of the tefticle, the better to fupport the weight. 6. The ligament of the thigh * is a diflinct liga- ment, and not merely the tendon of the external ob- lique, rounded and turned in. It arifes from the fpi- nous procefs of the ilium, and is inferted into the crefl: of the pubis. It receives the external oblique mufcle, for the tendon is implanted into it. Part of the flefli of the internal oblique mufcle arifes from the outer end of the ligament. It forms an arch under' which the pfoas and iliacus mternus mufcles, and the great artery of the thigh, and its anterior nerve, pafs out. The great vein, and the lymphatics of the limb, re- turn under it to get into the abdomen; the lympha- tic glands of the groin lie there. The whole interfiles is furrounded and filled up by cellular fubflance and fat; but it is not firm; the playing of the mufcles, and the fat, and inguinal glands, keep it open, and lax ; and'at that point the bowels are apt to fall down, efpecially in women, where the fpine of the ilium is high and the arch wide. So little are femoral hernias or the form of this opening underftood, that no particu- lar cufhion is adapted to this part; for it is fupported by the common bandage for the hernia of the groin: * This ligament of the thigh is named alfo the inguinal liga- ment ; the crural arch; the ligament of Paupart; the ligament of Fallopius, &c.

MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES. 375 it; and the lumbricales are the flexores primi interno- dii: the short muscle, the flexor fecundi intemodii; .the long flexor, the flexor tertii intemodii digitorum. EXTENSORS OF THE TOES. CXCIII. The EXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITORUM PEDIS is very difficult to difleet from its numerous adheffons. It arifes properly from the head of the tibia, at its outer and fore part, juft under the knee; but it has alfo ftrong adheffons to the inner furface of the fafeia; to the tendinous partitions betwixt it and the tibialis antieus before, and betwixt it and the peronaei behind ; and alfo to the interroffeous ligament and to the edge of the fibula. Its fmall origin foon becomes thick, and is divided even from the beginning very percepti- bly into three diftinct portions. Thefe foon form three round tendons, which go obliquely inwards, pafs un- der the the annular ligament of the ankle, and run in a ring of it peculiar to them and the peronaeus tertius. They then traverfe the two bands of the annular li- gament, upon the fore part of the foot; and now they change their direction a little, and go from within out- wards, and diverge towards their proper toes. There are three portions of mufcles and four toes to be moved ; the firft portion divides its tendon into two at the joint; fo that the firft portion ferves both the firft and fecond toe, the fecond the third toe, and the third ferves the fourth toe, • Here the tendon of the long extenfor receives four other tendons ; firft of the inter- olfaei externi; fecondly, of the interoflsei interni; third- ly, of the long flexor ; fourthly, of the lumbricales ; and thefe form a very large Iheath, quite furrounding •the toe.

jr4 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN, nous 5 This is the whole of its infertion, viz. all the length of the linea alba, from the pubis to the fternum, the fore part of the fpine of the ilium, and the ligament of Paupart; which, though it is commonly thought to be but the tendon of the external oblique firetching from point to point, is in truth a diftindt ligament, in- dependent of the tendon, and ftronger than it. CXLIV. Obliouus internus abdominis.â€”The chief part of this mufcle arifes thick and flefhy from all the circle of the fpine of the ilium, with its fibres directed upwards. But, to be accurate, we muff de- fcribe it as arifmg from the whole length of the fpine of the ilium ; from the joining of the ilium and facrum ; from the fpines of the facrum itfelf; and from the three lower fpinous precedes of the loins * ; and, laflly, it arifes from the ligament of the thigh, as its end next to the ilium ; but ftill the chief belly is at the iliac fpine. From that it fpreads upwards in a radiated form ; the central fibres only are direft, going acrofs the abdo- men to the linea alba; the higher fibres afeend and go towards the fternum, and the lower ones go oblique- ly downwards to the pubis. Its hat tendon is like that of the external oblique ; and it is inferted into the car- tilages of all the falfe ribs, into the fternum, and into the linea alba through its whole length. CXLV. The tr ansversalis abdominis runsdireft- Iy acrofs the belly. It arifes fiefny from the inner fur- face cf the fix lower ribs, where its digitations mix with thofe by which the diaphragm arifes tendi- * This origin from the fpinous proceiTes cf the loins is a thin ten- don common with the ferratus and latiffimus dorfi mufcles.

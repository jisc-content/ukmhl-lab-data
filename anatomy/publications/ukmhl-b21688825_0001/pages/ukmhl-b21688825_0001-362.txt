^lS MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN, think the trued defcription is this, that all the tendons meet and adhere in the femilunar line; that they im- mediately part to form this (heath ; that the fiat ten- dons of both the oblique mufcles go upon the outer furface of the redbus to form that fide of the (heath ; that the tendon of the tranfverfe mufele only lies under the rectus, forming the lower part of the (heath, and that it is unaffifted by any lamella of the inner oblique mufele ; that the (heath is complete at the fore part, or over the mufele ; but that under the muf- cle the (heath (tops about five or fix inches above the pubis, and that there the redti mufcles {or in their place the pyramidal mufcles) lie bare upon the bladder and other abdominal vifeera, lined only by the thin peritonaeum *. And that this back layer of the (heath is thinner and more delicate, and but lit- tle attached to the back part of the redlus mufele* which is eafily raifed in difledtion ; while the fore part of the (heath adheres firmly to the fore part of the mufele forming thofe crofs bands or tendinous inter- fedfions which divide the redtus into bellies; and the (heath where it lies over the mufele cannot be diffec- ted without a degree of violence either to the (heath or to thefe tendinous interfedtions. 4. The umbilicus is that opening in the centre of the abdomen, in the middle of the linea alba, through which the nutritious veifels of the foetus pafs. The * Cowper had never obferved this, but once that the lower part of the reftus was not lined by the tendon of the tranfverfalis.

138 OF THE TRUNK. The ramus, or branch, rifes obliquely upwards and forwards to join a like branch of the pubis. This branch, or arm as it is called, is flat, and its edges are turned a little forwards and backwards, fo that one edge forms the arch of the pubis, while the other edge forms the margin of the thyroid hole. The os pubis, or share-bone, is the lafl and fmallefl: piece of the os innominatum ; and is named from the mons veneris being placed upon it, and its hair being a mark of puberty. It forms the upper or fore part of the pelvis, and completes the brim ; and, like the if- chium, it alfo is divided into three parts, viz. the body, ANGLE, and RAMUS. The body of the pubis is thick and ftrong, and forms about one-fifth of the focket for the thigh bone. It is not only the fmallefl;, but the fhalloweft part of the focket. The bone grows fmaller as it advances to- wards its angle, the joining of the ofla pubis. There it grows again broad and flat, and the two bones meet with rough furfaces, but with two cartilages interpo- fed. Over the middle of this bone, two great mufcles, the iliac and pfoas mufcles, pafs out of the pelvis to the thigh ; and where they run under the ligament of the thigh, they make the pubis very fmooth. Along this bone there is a little edge, or fharp ridge, which marks the brim of the pelvis; and the part which is over the fymphifis, or joining of the bones, rifing high- er than the reft of the ridge, is named the creft of the pubis ; and from this point the fmall pyramidal muf- cles of the abdomen rife. The ramus, or branch, is that more {lender part of the pubis, which, joining 4 with

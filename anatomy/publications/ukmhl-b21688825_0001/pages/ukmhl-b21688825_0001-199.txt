THIGH, leg, and foot. *55 Is fmallsiL than the upper, in the fame proportion that the ankle is fmaller than the knee. The pointed part of this head of the tibia reprefents the mouth piece, or flute part of the pipe, and conftitutes the bump of the inner ankle. The lower end of the fibula lies fo upon the lower end of the tibia, as to form the outer ankle ; and there is on the fide of the tibia a deep hollow, like an imprefiion made with the point of the . thumb, which receives the lower end of the fibula. The acute point of the tibia, named the procefs of the inner ankle, palfes beyond the bone of the foot, and, by lying upon the fide of the joint, guards the ankle, fo that it cannot be luxated inwards, without this pointed procefs of the maleolus internus, or inner ankle, being broken. The tibia is a bone of great fize, and needs to be fo, for it fupports the whole weight of the body. It is not at all aflilled by the fibula in bearing the weight, the fibula, or flender bone, being merely laid upon the fide of the tibia, for ufes which fhall be explained prefently. The tibia is thick, with much cancelli or fpongy fubflance within; has pretty firm plates with- out ; is much ftrengthened by its ridges, and by it$ triangular form : its ridges are regular with regard to each other, but the whole bone is twilled as if it had been turned betwixt the hands when foft: This dif- tortion makes the procefs of the inner ankle lie not re- gularly uporl the fide of that joint, but a little obliquely forwards, determining the obliquity of the foot; which mull be of much confequence, fince there are many provifions for fecuring this turning of the foot, viz. the oblique pofition of the trochanters ; the oblique infertion

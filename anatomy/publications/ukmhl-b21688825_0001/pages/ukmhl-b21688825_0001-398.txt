MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. 35 4 This large mafs of mufcle or flefli enwraps the whole of the thigh-bone behind as well as before : for, firft, the crur^us arifes flelhy from all the fore part of he bone; the vastus externus from the great tro- chanter, and all the back part and outer fide of the bone; and the vastus internus arifes, in like man- ner, from the lelfer trochanter, and all the inner fide of the bone, from the trochanter major all round to the origin of the crurseus. CLXXII. The crur^us arifes from the fore part of the trochanter minor ; and it continues its origin from the fore part of the femur, the whole way down to within two inches or little more of" the patella. About three inches from its origin it is joined by the vastus externus, which unites with it at the outer edge and fore part; and the vastus internus comes into it about five inches below its origin, and joins it at the inner edge and fore part. At its lower part it is joined to the tendon of the reflus, to form but one large tendon, which is inferted into the rotula. Under the crurseus are fometimes found two little mufcles, or rather two little flips of this mufcle, which are quite diftinft. They arife on the fore part of the thigh-bone, two or three inches above the capfule of the joint; and they are inferted into the capfule on each fide of the patella, evidently for the purpofe of pulling it up,, to prevent its being catched ; and when thefe two (subcrur^i) are not found as diftinft muf- fles, fome fibres of the crurseus fupply their place. CLXXIII. The vastus externus is thedargefl of thefe three mufcles. Its

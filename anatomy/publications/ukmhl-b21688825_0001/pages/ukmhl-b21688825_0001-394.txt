350 MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. CLXX. The quadratus femoris, is a thin flat mufcle, pafling in a tranfverfe direction betwixt the tuber ifchii and the thigh-bone. It arifes from the lower and flattened furface of the tuber ischii by a Ihort tendinous beginning. It goes a little obliquely upwards and outwards, and is in- ferted into the back of the great trochanter, in that roughnefs which is found juft where the trochanter is joined to the bone, and goes obliquely betwixt the trochanter major and the trochanter minor. It rolls the thigh-bone, fo as to turn the toe out- wards, and pulls it almoft diredtly backwards. The motions of the thigh muft be performed by many very ftrong mufcles, as it moves under the ■weight of the whole body; and it feems to be curi- oufly contrived, that the mufcles fit for moving the thigh forward Ihould, in certain pofitions of the thigh, move it backwards; alfo giving an increafe of ftrength to that motion of the thigh in which moft ftrength is required. There are but two, or chiefly two, points for infer- tion; the trochanter major and the trochanter minor. Thefe two points are fo oblique, that no one mufcle, nor fet of mufcles, performs any diredt motions; for they all twift round the bone’s axis, to get at their in- fertion. The glutsei, the pyriformis, the gemini, the quadratus, the obturator internus, and obturator ex- ternus, all bend round the axis of the thigh-bone, to reach the trochanter major. Thefe now may be called the abduftors of the thigh, to pull it outwards; but Wo Ihould conclude from this direction, that they could

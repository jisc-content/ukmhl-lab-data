DESCRIPTION OF THE to Fifing from the mouth of the Euftachian tube, turns â– wltfi a fmall tendon round this hook, like a rope over its pub ley ; and the great mufcles of the lower jaw, the only ones for moving its fidewife, or for its grinding mo-> tions, arife from the pterygoid proceffes, fo as to be named the external and internal pterygoid mufcles, accord ng to the proceffes from which they arife. 6. The azygous process*, is fo named, from its be- ing Angle, becaufe it is feated in the centre of the bone, fo that it can have no fellow. It Hands perpen- dicularly downwards and forwards, over the centre of the nofe, and its chief ufe is to give a firm feat or infertion for the vomer, or bone, which forms the fep- tum. This, with the azygous procefs of the asthmoid bone united, forms the upper and back parts of the feptum; and the vomer, or proper bone of the par- tition, Hands, with a fplit edge, aftride over thefe two proceffes, fo as to have a very firm feat. 7. The clynoid processes, have, like many partsof the human body, a very whimfical name, very ill fuit- ed to exprefs their form; for it is not eafy, in this in- flance, to acknowledge the likenefs of four little knobs to bed-pofls; yet the clynoid proceffes are very remark- able. The two anterior clynoid processes are fmall bumps, rather {harp, projecting backwards, and ter- minating in two flat projecting points. The poste- * Azygous is a term, which is applied to fuch parts as have no fellow ; becaufe almolt always the parts on one fide of the body are balanced by fimilar and correfponding parts on the other fide. When they Hand in the centre of the body, or are otherwife Angle, we call them azygous ; and fo the axygous procefs of the sethmoid and fphenoid, and other bones; or the azygous vein, which runs in the centre of the thorax, and in Angle.

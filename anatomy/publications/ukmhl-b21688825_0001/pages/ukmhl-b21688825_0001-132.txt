The fize of this ca- vity feems to determine the height of the cheek-bone* and the form of the face; and the difeafed enlarge? ment of this cavity raifes the cheek-bone, lefiens the eye, and deforms the face in a very extraordinary de- gree. Thefe procefies, and this cavity of the bone, are what deforve moil particular notice. i. The firfl is the nasal process, which extends upwards, to form the fide of the nofe. It is arched outwards, to give the noftrils fhape. Its Tides fupport the nafal bones; and the cartilages of the alae nafi, or wings ofthe nofe, are fixed to the edges of this pro- cefs. i. A plate of this bone is called the orbitary pro- cefs. This thin plate is the roof of the great cavity, which occupies this bone entirely. It is at once as a roof to the antrum rnaxillare and as a floor for the eye to roll upon. There is a wide groove along the upper lurface of this plate, in which the chief branch of the upper maxillary nerve lies : And this branch, named infra orbitary nerve from its lying thus under the eye, comes out by a hole of the jaw-bone under the eye, which is named infra orbitary hole. And thus the nerve appearing upon the cheek, is the chief perve of the face. 3. This great bone is the bafis upon which the cheek-bone Hands; and that it may have a firm place, there is a rough and (a6 anatcmifts call it) fcabrous furface, which makes a very firm future with the cheek? bone; and as this furface rifes a little, it is named the jnalar procefs, ^ From

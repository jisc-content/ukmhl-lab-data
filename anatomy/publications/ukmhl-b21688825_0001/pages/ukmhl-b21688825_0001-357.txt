3*3 AND OF THE DIAPHRAGM. for it is only as a fupplement to the reÂ£ti mufcles and a part of them ; whence it has been named musculus SU-ccenturiatus, or fupplementary mufcle. CXLIII. The external oblique mufcle arifesfrom the ribs, and, like all the others which arife from ribs, is a ferrated mufcle. It comes from the eight lower ribs by diftinft flefliy tongues, one from each rib. Thefe feme are mixed with the indentations of the ferratus major anticus mufcle, which goes off in an oppolite direction. The origin of the mufcle lies out broad upon the border of the cheft; it is its thickefl and moil flefhy part, whence its fibres go down all in one direction parallel with each other, but oblique with refpeft to the abdomen. Its flefhy belly ceafes about the middle of the fide. Its flat fheet of tendon goes over the fore part of the belly till it meets its fek low exactly in the middle ; fo that one half, or the back part of the abdomen, is covered by its flefhy belly, and the fore part by its tendinous expanfion. 1 The mufcle meets its fellow in the middle of the belly ; and this meeting forms (along with the other tendons) a white line from the pubis to the flernum, which is named linea alba. It alfo, before it reaches the middle, adheres to the flat tendon of the inner ob- lique mufcle. This meeting is about four inches on ei- ther fide of the linea alba, and is a little inclined to the circular, whence it is named linea femilunaris. And, finally, this mufcle is implanted into the fpine of the ilium ; flefhy about the middle of the ilium ; ten- dinous at the fore part or fpinous procefs of the ilium ; and Hill tendinous into the whole length of that liga- ment, which extends from the fpine of the ilium tq the crefl: of the pubis.

452 JOINTS OF THE And, 6.~ The mucous folicular bundles of fat, and the burfe mucofce, which completes the lubricating apparatus of the joint, and the mucous frenulae or ligaments, which both conduct the mucous fringes and keep them in their place, are more perfect in the knee, and greater in number and fize than in any other joint. I may well cal! this the moft complicated, and (by daily and melancholy proofs) it is known to be the moft delicate joint of the body. FIBULA. The fibula is a fupport to the tibia in its various accidents \ it gives a broader origin to the mufcles, and it is the chief defence of the ankle-joint. It has no motion upon the tibia; the belt authors fpeak of it as a fymphyfis, which clafles it with the joinings of the pelvis, and excludes it from the liftâ€™ of true and moveable joints. It is united with the tibia by a fort of flat cartilaginous furface upon either bone ; it is merely laid upon the tibia, not funk into it. It is tied by a clofe capfule : it has no particular ligament for itfelf; but is ftrengthened by the external lateral ligament of the knee, which adheres to this knob, and by the in- fertiori of the biceps tendon, which is implanted into this point, and which fpreads its expanded tendon over the fore part of the tibia, and holds the bones together; and the firmnefs of the fibula is further fe- cured by the great interofleus ligament, which goes from bone to bone. ANKLE. The ankle-joint owes lefs of its ftrength to liga- ments than to the particular forms of its bones; for while

MUSCLES OF THE I96 The occipito-frontalis, but efpecially its occipital belly, raifes the eyebrows; the pointed flip of the fame mufcle pulls them downwards; the corrugator pulls them diredtly inwards, and knits the brows; the levator palpebras opens the eyelid ; and the orbicularis oculi clofes the eye. Whether certain fibres from the platifma-myoides (a thin flat mufcle which mounts from the neck over the cheek) may not pull down the lower eyelid; or whether fome ftraggling fibres, arifmg from the zygoma, may not have the appearance of a depreflbr of the lower eyelid, it is not neceflary to determine, fince there is no regularly appointed mufcle; and the lower eyelid, is almolt immoveable, at leaft in man. MUSCLES OF THE NOSE AND MOUTH. V. Levator labii superioris et alje nasi. Cowper defcribes the levator labii fuperioris as an ir- regular production of the frontalis, extending along the noftrils. But it is a neat and delicate mufcle, which arifes, by a fmall double tendon, from the nafal procefs of the upper jaw-bone, clofe by the tendon of the orbicularis oculi. It is one little fafciculus of mufcular fibres above; but as it approaches the nofe, it fpreads out broader, dividing into two fmall fafci- culi; one of which is implanted into the wing or cartilage of the nofe, and the other, palling the angle of the nofe, goes to the upper lip. Thus it is pyra- midal with its bafe downwards, arid was named pyra- midalis by Caferius, Winflow, and others. It is called by Cowper dilator alas nafi. It raifes the upper lip, and

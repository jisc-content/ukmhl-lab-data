LOWER JAW, THROAT, AND TONGUE. 2I| p 4 name* the middle line of the throat. This prominent line of the thyroid cartilage is eafily felt in the middle of the throat, is about an inch in length, and makes that tumour which is called the pomum Adami. The flat fides of the thyroid cartilage form the fides of the flute part of the trachea. And there are two long horns at its two upper corners, which rife like hooks above the line of the cartilage, and are joined to the horns of the os hyoides ; and two fimilar, but fhorter- hooks below, by which it embraces the cricoid cartilage. The cricoid cartilage is next to the thyroid, and below it; it is named from its refemblance to a ring : It is indeed like a ring or hoop, but it is not a hoop equally deep in all its parts, it is fhallow before, where it ekes out the length of the thyroid cartilage, and is, deeper behind, where it forms the back of this flute- like top of the trachea ; it is the top ring of the tra- chea, and the lower ring of the larynx or flute part of the windpipe. And upon its back, or deeper part, are feated thofe two fmall cartilages, which form the opening for the breath. The arytenoid cartilages are two fmall bodies, of the fize of peafe. They are foolifhly defcribed with cornua, ridges, and furfaces, when they are fo fmall that nothing further can be obferved of their forms than that they are fomewhat triangular ; that the bafe or broad part of each flts down upon the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage at its back; that the point of each Hands direÂ£Uy upwards, and is a very little crooked or hook-like, that (landing, as they do, a little apart from each other, they form together ah opening fomethipg like the fpout of a ewer, or ftrouped bafon, whence thejr

MUSCLES OF THE, &C. 21 I inner furface of that ftrong tendinous membrane which is extended from the jugum to the femicircular ridge of the parietal bone. The fibres are bundled together and prelfed into a fmall compafs, fo that they may pafs under the jugum; there they take a new hold upon the inner furface of the jugum, and the mufcle is of courfe pyramidal, its rays converging towards the ju- gum. Its mufcular fibres are intermixed with ftrong tendinous ones; it is particularly tendinous where it paffes under the jugum ; and it has both flrength and protection from that tendinous plate which covers it in the temple. Its^infertion is into the horn of the lower jaw-bone ; not merely into the tip of the horn, but embracing it all round, and down the whole length of the procefs, fo as to take the firmeft hold. XXXI. The masseter is a fhort, thick, and flefliy mufcle, which gives the rounding of the cheek at its back part. It arifes from the upper jaw-bpne, at the back of the antrum, and under the cheek-bone, and from the lower edge of the zygoma. It lies upon the outfide of the coronoid procefs, covering the branch of the jaw quite down to its angle. It is particularly ftrong ; has many maflfy bundles of flefh interfperfed with tendinous firings ; the parotid gland lies on its upper part,.and the duft of the gland fas it croffes the cheek) lies over this mufcle. The jaw is very firmly pulled up by thefe two, which are its mofl powerful mufcles ; and when we bite, we can feel the temporal mufcle fweliing on the flat part of the temple, and this the mafleter upon the back part of the cheek, XXXII.

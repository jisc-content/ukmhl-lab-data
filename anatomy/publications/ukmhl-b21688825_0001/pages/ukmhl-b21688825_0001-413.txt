Then it is implanted into the two f rft metatarfal bones, then into the calcaneum, and laftly into the os cuboides; and where it paffes over the os naviculare it is hardened into a fort of fefamoid bone. In fhort, it is implanted in the foie of the foot by a tendon like a hand, which fends down its fingers among the tarfal and metatarfal bones, to take the fa- red: hold. This mufcle pulls the foot in fo as to put the toes together: and when balanced by the peronssi, it direCtly bends the foot. CLXXXVII. The tibialis anticus croffes ob- liquely the fore part of the leg. It arifes from the fore part and outfide of the tibia. It begins juft under the outer tuber, and continues its adhefion down two-thirds of the bone; then the tendon begins to be formed : and this mufcle, like almofl all the fmaller ones of the leg, adheres to the tendinous partitions, and to the fafcia, with which they are covered. The tendon begins al- moft with the origin of the mufcle; but continues co- vered by the flefh, and not appearing till within four inches or fo of the ankle, when it begins to pafs ob- liquely over the leg ; and having compleated the crof- fing above the ankle, it goes under the annular liga- ment in a peculiar ring ; it runs along the fide of the foot, and is implanted into the os cuneiforme internum j and a fmall production of the tendon goes forward to be inferted into the metatarfal bone of the great toe* It is the only mufcle which bends the foot, that is, which turns the great toe towards the leg. voL. i. b b MUSCLES

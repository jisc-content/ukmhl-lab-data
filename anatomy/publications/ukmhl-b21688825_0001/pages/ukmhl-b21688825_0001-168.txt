224' OF THE TRUNK, ligaments and mufeles from the fpine, which fufpend and move the rib. 5. The angle of the rib is often mentioned, being a common mark for the place of furgical operations. There is a flatnefs of the thorax behind, forming the breadth of the back ; the ftiarpnefs where this flatnefs begins to turn into the roundnefs of the cheft, is form- ed by the angl es of the ribs. Each rib is round in the place of its head, neck, and tubercles; it grows flat- ter a little, as it approaches the angle; but it is not completely flattened till it has turned the angle which is the proper boundary betwixt the round and the flat parts of the rib. It is very evident that this anatomy of the ribs is neither diiiicuk nor important. It is in foine degree ufeful, in the more advanced parts of anatomy, to re-, member the names; and it is neceffary, even in fpeak- ing the common language of furgeons, to know thefe parts, viz. the head of the rib; the tubercle, or fe- cond articulating furface; the angle, or turning for- ward of the rib ; the upper round, and the lower flat edge; and efpecially to remember the place and the dangers of the intercoftal artery. But there are fome peculiarities in individual ribs ; the chief of which are thefe: The fize or length of the ribs gradually de- creafes from the firft to the laft, the firft being exceed- ingly fliort and circular, the lower ones longer, and al- moft right-lined; fo that the thorax is altogether of a conical fliape, the upper opening fo fmall, as juft to per- mit the trachea, oefophagus, and great veflels, to pafs ; the lower opening fo large, that it equals the diameter of the abdomen: The firft rib is confequently very Ihortj

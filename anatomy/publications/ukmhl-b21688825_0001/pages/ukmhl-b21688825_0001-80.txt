$6 OF TfiE SKULL IN GENERAL, marks which we take of the fkull, record the en- trance of arteries; the exit of veins and nerves ; the places and ufes of thofe mufcles which move the jaws, the throat, the fpine. Indeed, in all the human body, there is not found fo complicated and difficult a ftudy, as this anatomy of the head ; and if this fatiguing ftu- dy can be at all relieved, it mud be by firft edablifh- ing a very regular and orderly demonflration of the fkull. For this end, we diftinguiffi the face, where the ir- regular furface is compofed of many fmall bones, from the cranium or Ikull cap, where a few broad and flat fhaped bones form the covering of the brain. It is thefe chiefly which enclofe and defend the brain, which are expofed to injuries, and are the fubject of operation. It is thefe alfo that tranfmit the nerves. So that the cranium is* equally the object of attention with the anatcmid and with the furgeon. All the bones of the cranium are of a flattened form, confiding of two tables, and an intermediate di- ploe, which anfwers to the cancelli of other bones. The tables of the fkull are two flat and even plates of bone: the external is thought to be thicker, more fpongy, lefs eadly broken ; the thinner table, again, is denfe, thin and brittle, very eadly broken, and is fome- times fractured, while the external table remains en- tire : Thence it is named tabula vitrea, or the glaffy ta- ble. Thefe tables are parted from each other by the didance of a few lines* ; and this fpape is filed up with the * In anatomy there is occafion in alfnoft every defcription, for a fcale of fmaller parts.

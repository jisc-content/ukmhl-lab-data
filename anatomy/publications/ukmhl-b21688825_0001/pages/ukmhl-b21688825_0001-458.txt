414 of *he tendons, of the lefs feeling parts, there is indeed future danger, there is no immediate pain* Still there are many acci- dents which prove to us, that even in health the joints are not entirely exempted from pain : a fmart ftroke on the knuckles, or a blow on the elbow, or a fall up- on the knee, are not perhaps the pureft inftances of feeling in joints; for fuch blow may have hurt fome external nerve: but when a fmall moveable cartilage forms within the joint of the knee, though it be fmali and very fmooth, and lodged fairly within the cavity of the joint, it often gets betwixt the bones, caufmg inftant lamenefs ; the moment it c^ufeth this lamenefs, it brings dreadful pains: the pain, the lamenefs, and all the feeling of inconveniency, fubfide the in- ftant that this cartilage is moved away from betwixt the bones ; and the joint continues eafy till this moving cartilage chances again to fall in betwixt the heads of the bones. Even the pain from a blow upon the knee, for, example, is plainly within the joint, and is caufed by the force with which the patella is ftruck, down againft the ends of the bones. What indeed is a fprain, but a general violence and twilling of all the parts which compofe the joint ? Thefe parts are of one common nature, and may be arranged and enumerated thus: A joint is compofed of the heads of the bones, fwelling out into a broader articulating furface, and of a thin plate of cartilage, which covers and defends the head of each bone; fometimes of fmall and moveable cartilages which roll upon the bones, and follow all the motions of the joint, and, like fridion-wheels in ma- chines of human invention, abate the bad effeds of mo- tion. There are mucous glands, or rather mucous bags, \vhich convey a lubricating fluid: and there is a burfal 14 ligament.

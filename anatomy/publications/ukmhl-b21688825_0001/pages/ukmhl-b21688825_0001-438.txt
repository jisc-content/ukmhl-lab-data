How this divifion is accomplifhed we do not know in any furer way; but we fee that the heart, the lungs, the ftomach, and the inteftines, have a proportion of nerves, fo much lower than the mufcles of voluntary motion, that the very exiftence of thefe nerves has been denied. Yet there are nerves proper to the vital parts : the phrenic nerve goes to the diaphragm ; the par vagum to the ftomach and bowels; the fympathe- tic nerve to the heart; they are fmaller, but they are appropriated and diftindt.

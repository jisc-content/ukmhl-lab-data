149 THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT. figned and marked in the very fird formation of the bone, and intended, perhaps, for the advantage of the ftrong mufcles in the back of the thigh, to give them greater power, or more room. 2. The head of the thigh-bone is likewife the mod perfedt of any in the human body ; for its circumfe- rence is a very regular circle, of which the head con, tains nearly two-thirds: It is fmall, neat, and com- pletely received into its focket, which is not only deep jn itfelf, and very fecure, but is further deepened by the cartilage which borders it; fo that this is naturally, and without the help of ligaments, the ficronged joint in all the body ; but among other fecurities which are fuperadded, is the round ligament, the mark of which is eafily feen, being a broad dimple in the centre of its head. 3. The neck of this bone is the trued in the Ikele- ton ; and indeed, it is from this neck of the thigh-bone that we transfer the name to other bones, which have hardly any other murk of neck than that which is made by their purfe-like ligament being fixed behind the head of the bone, and leaving a roughnefs there. But the neck of the thigh-bone is an inch and a half in length, thick and ftrong, yet hardly proportioned to the great weights which it has to bear; long, that it may allow the head to be fet deeper in its focket ^ and danding wide up from the fhoulder of the bone, to keep its motions wide and free, and unembarraffed by the pelvis ; for without this great length of the neck, its motions had been checked even by the edges of its own focket.

MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. 309 vertebra of the neck, where the oppofite large mufcles meet in one point almoft *. All thefe mufcles, which lie thus flat upon the plain furface of the vertebrae of the neck, pull the head and neck diredly forwards ; or when the mufcles of one fide aft, they are of ufe in pulling it towards that fide ; though I rather fuppofe that that motion is performed by the external mufcles. CXLII. The scalenus I confider as one mufcle ; for it is one in origin, infertion, and office. Its origin is from the whole upper furface of the firft rib from its cartilage backwards, and alfo from the fecond rib ; and its infertion is into the tranfverfe procefles of the vertebrae of the neck. But by its broad origin, and its very long infertion, is gives opportunity for dividing it into feveral fafciculi; and accordingly it has been fo divided : but thefe divifions are entirely modern, artificial, and unnatural. The ancients confidered it as one triangular mufcle: Window divided it into two, the primus and fecundus ; Cowper into three ; Douglas into four; and Albinus divides it into five mufcles. The ancients called it fealenus from its re- femblance to the fcalen triangle ; and the true anatomy is to confider it as one great triangular mufcle, flat, and firetching from the ribs to the neck, doling the thorax above, and giving paflfage to the nerves and veflels of the arm. If it were to be defcribed in diflind portions, it would be in three parts. The anterior portion arifes from the tranfverfe procefles of the fix lower verte- * Thelongus colli mufcle is in part covered by the reft us major. x 3 bra:.

418 JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE. ced upon the oblique furfaces of the atlas, that it cannot turn in circles; but at that joint all the nod- ding motions are performed. The atlas refls fo upon the dentatus, that there all die turning motions are performed. The neck and loins have their ver- tebras fo loofely framed, with fuch perpendicular pro- ceffes and eafy joints, that there all the bending mo- tions are performed; while the back is fixed, or al- mofl fixed, by its connection with the ribs, and by the obliquity and length of its fpines; and though upon the whole, the fpine turns many degrees, yet it is with a limited and elaftic motion where the whole turning is great, but the movement of each individual bone is fmalh To fecure thefe motions, we find, i. The occipital condyles received into hollows of the atlas, where the oblique pofition of the condyles fecures the joint, the occipital condyles looking outwards, the articu- lating furfaces of the atlas looking towards each other, the occiput fet down betwixt them, fo as to be fecu- red towards either fide, and the obliquity of the joint being fuch withal as to prevent the head from turn- ing round. Thefe joints of the occiput of the atlas are, like the greater joints of the body, fecured with regular capfules, or bag-like ligaments for each con- dyle, each riling from a rough furface on the verte- bra, and being fixed into a roughnefs at the root of the condyle. 2. We find a flat membranous ligament, which extends from the ring of the atlas to the ring of the occipital hole, clofing the interfiles betwixt the occiput and the atlas: It is confounded at the fides with the capfules of the articulating precedes* is

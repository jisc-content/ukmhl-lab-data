MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES. 371 tile root of the great toe; it then goes forward in a {heath, to be inferted into the lad bone of the great toe; at which implantation it is enlarged. Its office is to bend the great toe, but it is alfo conÂ« tinually ufeful at every ftep in extending the foot, or in keeping the toe firm to the ground, while the gaf- trocnemii raife the heel; and therefore we fhould not be rafh in cutting away the great toe, for in it confifls not the ftrength of the foot only but of the leg. CLXXXIX. The flexor longus digitorum pe- dis, is named, in addition, the perforans ; becaufe, like the perforans of the hand, it runs its tendons through the fplit tendon of a fmaller mufcle, which is lodged in the foie of the foot. It is named alfo flexor communis ; although there be lefs reafon here, where there are no flexors for the individual toes, than in the hand, where there are feparate flexors for the individual fingers. It arifes from the back part of the tibia, its whole length ; that is from the end of the poplitseal mufcle, and from the feptum tendinofum, by which it is di- vided from the tibialis anticus, which lies immediately before it; and it continues this origin from the tibia down to within three inches or fo of the ankle. Its origin is not eafdy feparated before from the tibialis pofticus, nor behind from the flexor pollicis. The tendon is not formed till very near the ankle (within two inches of it), and the fleffi flill accom- panies it quite down to the joint. It crofles the tendon of the tibialis pofticus behind the ankle joint, and goes forward in the groove of the os calcis, tied down by a fort of capfule or annular ligament. In the arch of b b 2 the

MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 233 chief motion, viz. backwards and forwards, flexion and extenfion : It has no other motions than thofe of the thigh and of the knee. But the arm requires an eafy and circular motion ; and its joints are multiplied; for it has the wrift turning round; it has the elbow for hinge-like motions ; it has the Ihoulder-joint upon which the arm rolls; and to affid all thefe, the fcapu- la, which is the centre of all thefe motions, is itfelf moveable ; ■ after a certain point of elevation all the motion in railing the arm is performed, not by the mo- tions of the Ihoulder-bone upon the fcapula, but by the fcapula upon the trunk. For whenever the Ihoulder- bone rifes to the horizontal diredlion, it is checked by the acromion, which hangs over it; and if the arm is to be raifed higher dill, the fcapula mull roll; for it turns as if upon an axis palfed through it, and in turn- ing it glides upon thofe mufcles, which are like a culhion betwixt it and the trunk. The mufcles which move the fcapula come from the bread to move it forwards; from the neck, to move it upwards; from the fpines of the vertebra:, to move it backwards; and from the fide, that is, from the ribs, to move it downwards. LXII. The trapezius is named from its lozenge form ; or is often named cucularis, from its refem- bling the Monk’s cowl; hanging back upon the neck. It is one of the mod beautiful mufcles in the body; and the two mufcles together cover all the Ihoulders and neck, with a lozenge-like form, with neat and lharp points, extending from the tip of one Ihoulder to the tip of the other, and from the nape of the neck qujte down to the loins.

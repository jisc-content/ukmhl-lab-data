i;0 BONES OF THE 7. This 5. This head, or glenoid cavity of the fcapuia, is planted upon a narrower part, which tends towards a point, but is finiihed by this flat head; this narrower part is what is named the neck of the scapula, which no doubt fometimes gives way, and breaks. A rough line bordering the glenoid cavity receives the capfular ligament, or rather the capfule arifes from that border- ing griille, which I have faid tips the circle. 6. The spine of the scapula, is that high ridge of bone, which runs the whole length of its upper fur- face, and divides it into two fpaces for the origin of fupra and infra fpinatus mufcles. It is high, and very fharp. Handing up at one place to the height of two inches. It is flattened upon the top, and with edges, which turning a little towards either fide, give rife to two ftrong fafcise, i. e. tendinous membranes; which go from the fpine, the one upwards to the upper bor- der of the fcapuia, the other downwards to the lower border; fo that by thefe ftrong membranes the fca- puia is formed into two triangular cavities, and the fuora and infra fpinatus mufcles rife not only from the back of the fcapuia, and from the Tides of its fpine, but alfo from the inner furface of this tenfe membrane. The fpine traverfes the whole dorfum, or back of the fcapuia; it receives the trapezius mufcle, that beauti- ful triangular mufcle which covers the neck like a tip- pet, whence it has its name ; and*the fpine beginning low at the bafts of the fcapuia, gradually rifes as it ad- vances forwards, till it terminates in that high point or promontory which forms the tip of the fhoulder, and overhangs and defends the joint.

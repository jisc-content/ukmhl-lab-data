â–  MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 273 The ufe of this mufcle is to extend all the fingers ; and when they are fixed, it will aflift the extenfors of the wrift, as in ftriking backwards with the knuckles. And fince there is but one extenfor mufcle, the crofs tendons are a provifion againft the bad confequences of any fingle tendon being cut acrofs. XCVII. The extensor minimi digiti, named alfo auricularis from its turning up the little finger, as in picking the ear, fhould really be defcribed with the laft mufcle. If we fee the origin, courfe, and ufe of this mufcle exadly the fame with the common exten- for, why fhould we not reckon it as a flip of the com- mon extenfor, appropriated to the little finger ? Its origin is from the outer condyle, along with the other tendons. It alfo adheres fo clofely both to the tendinous partitions, and to the internal furface of the common fafcia, that it is not eafily feparated in diffec- tion. It begins fmall, with a conical kind of head; it gradually increafes in fize, it is pretty thick near the wrift; it adheres all along to the common exten- fors of the fingers 5 it begins to be tendinous about an inch above the head of the ulna; it continues to re- ceive flefhy fibres down to the annular ligament; and it pafles under the annular ligament in a channel pe- culiar to itfelf, which is indeed the beft reafon for making this a diftind mufcle. This channel has a very oblique diredion; and the tendon, like all the others, expands greatly in efcaping from the ligament of the wrift. It is conneded with the other tendons in the manner I have defcribed. Clofe to the wrift, it is conneded with the tendon of the. ring-finger, by a flip which comes from it j and at VOL, u T the

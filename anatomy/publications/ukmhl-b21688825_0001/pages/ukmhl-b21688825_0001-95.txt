OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL. 5! nat’ors who have worn it long, are diftinguiftied by their regular and beautiful features. Perhaps by con- trivance and force, we may diflort the head of a child; and we may almoft believe what is told of the negroes of the Caribbee iflands, who had contrived, by pref- fure, to flatten their children’s heads, that their race might be in future diftinguifhed from thofe who had fubmitted to the Spanifn yoke ; or of what is told fo often of eaftern nations, that they fometimes mould the heads of children into monftrous and uncouth forms, to extort charity, or as an adt of religion. Were I to aflign a reafon for the flexible bones, and wide futures, and the yielding condition of the head of the child, I fhould fay that it were meant by nature to fland in the place of that feparation of the bones of the pelvis which has been fuppofed, but which cannot exift:; for the child’s head is moulded with little injury, is evolved again without help ; and it feems a proviflon of nature, fince the child fcarcely feels the change: but no wo- man has been known to have the joinings of the pel- vis relaxed or diflolved without pain and danger, con- finement for many months, a temporary iamehefs ; and fometimes fhe is rendered unable for life. £ 2, CHAP,

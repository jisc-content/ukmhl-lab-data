I7S EONES OF T*HE the The uliia is in general of a triangular or prifmatid form, like the tibia, and the elbow is formed by the ulna alone; for there is a very deep notch or hinge- like furface, which feems as if it had been moulded upon the lower end of the humerus, embraces it very clofely; and takes fo fure a hold upon the hu- merus, that it allows not the fmalleft degree of late- ral motion, and almoft keeps its place in the dry fke- leton without the help of ligaments or mufcles ; it prefents, in profile, fomewhat of the fhape of the let- ter S, and therefore is named the sigmoid cavity of the ulna. 2. But this figmoid cavity were a very imperfefl hinge without the two proceffes by which it is guarded before and behind ; the chief of thefe is the olecranon or large bump, which forms the ex* treme point upon which we reft the elbow. It is a big and ftrong procefs, which, checking into a deep hollow in the back of the humerus, ferves two curi- ous purpofes \ it ferves as a long lever for the mufcles which extend or make ftraight the fore arm; and when by the arm being extended, it checks into its place, it takes fo firm a hold upon the hinge or joint of the os humeri, as to fecure the joint in pulling, and fuch other actions as might caufe a luxation fore- wards. '3, The other procefs which guards the el- bow-joint is named the coronoid process, from its horn or pointed form; it ftands up perpendicularly from the upper or fore part of the bone ; it forms the fore part of the figmoid cavity, and completes the hinge. It is ufeful, like the olecranon, in giving a fair hold and larger lever to the mufcles, and in fecuring the joint j for the arm being extended, as in pulling,

OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL* 44 the pufh onwards, till they are flopped at Iafl, and the perfed future, or ferrated line of union is formed. In dilating this proportion, we fhould obferve, that in the boy, all the bones in the head are membranous and imperfect. The membranous interfiices begin to be obliterated ; the futures are beginning to clofe ; the diflindion of two tables is not yet pftablifhed ; the cancelli are not yet interpofed betwixt the plates ; the finufes, or caverns of the bones, as in the forehead, the nofe, and the jaw are not formed ; and each bone is not only incomplete towards its edges and futures, but confifts often of many parts. The os frontis is formed of two pieces, which meet by a membranous union in the middle of the bone.. The ossa pa- rxetalia have one great and prominent point of odb hcation in the very centre of each, from which di- verging rays of edification extend towards the edges of the bone. The osoccipitis is formed in four diflind pieces ; and the temporal bones are fo fairly divided into two, that their parts retain in the adult the diftind names of petrous and fquamous bones. Although thefe are all the regular points of .edification, yet fometimes there occur fmall and dif- tind points, which form irregular bones, uncertain in number or fize, found chiefly in the lambdoid future, fometimes numerous and fmall, more commonly they are few in number, and fometimes of the full fize of a crown, always diflorting more or lefs the courfe of the future, and being thus a fubjed of caution to the furr geon : Thefe are named ossa triquetra, or trian- gularia, from their angular fh.ape, pr, Wormiana, /from Olaus Wormius, who obferved them firft.

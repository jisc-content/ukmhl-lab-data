306 muscles oE the trunk. colli are ftronger, becaufe the neck has many and quick motions, and the bifurcated fpines of the neck give broader furfaces for thefe mufcles. The inter- spinales dorsi are almoft entirely awanting, becaufe the fpines of the back are clofe upon each other, and the vertebrae are almoft ftxed. The interspinales in the loins are rather tendons or ligaments than proper mufcles. CXXXV. The intertransversales are again ftronger and fuller in the neck, becaufe of the lateral motions cf the neck being free, and its tranfverfe pre- cedes forked. They are in more numerous bundles where the motion is greateft, viz. betwixt the atlas and dentatus ; and it is there that Albinus counts his intertransversales cervicis, priores-late- rales, &c. The inter-tranfverfarii are awanting in the back, giving place to the ligaments, by which they are tied to each other and to the ribs; but in the loins, the inter-tranfverfarii are again ftrong, for the lateral or twilling motions of the loins. The mufcles on the fore part of the head and neck will complete the catalogue of thofe belonging to the fpine, and they are the chief antagonifts to the_ mufcles which I have been defcribing. CXXXVI. The platisma-myoidEs* is a very thin mufcular expanfion, like the cutaneous mufcle in ani- mals. It is fpread over the other mufcles immediately under the fkin, and covers the whole neck and lower part of the face. It arifes from the cellular fubftance and aponeurofis, * ThePLATisMA-MYOiDEs is alfo named musculus cvta* NEUS LATISSIMUS CQELI, and QUADK.ATUS CEH/E. which

322 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN, And, a few years ago, hernia of the groin was not even known by anatomifts of the higheft name. For Cowper fays (explaining Paupart’s ligament), “ It is “ not impoffible but that ruptures may fometimes “ happen in this part; and I am apt to imagine this “ to be the cafe when a rupture is very large, and not “ to be retained by a trufs.” It often happens, that in vomiting, in violent cough- ing, in draining at ftool, or in lifting heavy weights, thefe natural openings are forced, and the bowels de- fcend. The umbilicus is very feldom forced by fud- den exertion, for it is a very firm ring ; but often it is flowly dilated in pregnancy; and hernia of the navel is infinitely more frequent with women than with men. »—The opening of the ring is often kept, dilated by the bowels following the teflicle when it defcends; fo that though the accident be almod: forgotten, the hernia often appears again in the adult: molt fre- quently the ring is forced in ftrong young men by hard and continued labour, or by fudden draining; but women are fafer from this kind of hernia, becaufe the round ligament of the womb is fmaller than the fpermatic cord, and the ring in them is very clofe. —Abdominal hernia are thofe which cofhe, not through any natural opening, but through the inter- flices of the mufcles, by the parting of the mufcular fibres on an accidental wound in the abdomen, or by the operation of the Cefarean fedlion; for a wound of the abdominal mufcles feldom heals fo neatly as not to leave fome final 1 interflice, through which the bowels protrude. Thus any point may be forced by violence, any of the openings, or all of them, may be relaxed

INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. 59 f the groove lodges the great longitudinal finus, or, in other words, the great vein of the brain, which runs along the head, in the courfe of the perpendicular par- tition or falx. At the root of this fpine, there is a fmall blind hole, which will juft admit a pin ; it is named blind, becaufe it does not pafs quite through the bone, and the beginning of the falx, dipping down into this hold, gets a firmer hold. The ancients thinking that this hole defcended through both tables into the nofe, believed, that the dangerous and ungovernable bleed- ings at the nofe, muft be through this hole, and from the fore end, or beginning of the longitudinal finus. The orbitary process is the laid remarkable point of the frontal bone* The orbitary proceffes are two thin plates, departing from the general direction of the bone, and ftanding inwards at right angles : They cover the eye, and fupport the brain. By the continual rolling of the eye, and the preffiire of the brain, they are ex- tremely thin and tranfparent; the rolling of the eye makes them exquifitely fmooth below, and on their upper furfaces they are imprefled with the frequent convolutions of the brain: fo that a wound through the eye endangers more than the eye ; for it paffes eafily forward into the brain, and is inftantly fatal: it is the aim of a fencer; and we have known, in this country, a young man killed by the pufh of a foil which had loft its guard. Upon tjie orbitary plate, and juft under the fuper- ciliary ridge, there are two depreffions in the focket of each eye : the one is very fmall, and deeper at the inner corner of the eye, under the orbitary hole, which is the mark of the fmall cartilaginous pulley, . ill

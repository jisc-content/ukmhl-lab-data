INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. 79 for a fmall hole which permits the great artery of the dura mater to enter. 4. The point of this fpinous procefs projects in the form of a very fmall peak, which will hardly be found by the Undent. It projects from the bafis of the fkull juft within the condyle of the lower jaw ; and being a fmall point, like the point of the flilus, or iron pen, it alfo is named styloid process, and gives rife to a curious mufcle of the palate. 5. The pterygoid process* are four in number, two on either fide. They are thofe procefles, upon which (with the fpinous procefs) the bone naturally Hands, and which, when we compare it with a bat, reprefent the legs ; one of each fide is named external pterygoid 5 the other is named the internal pterygoid procefs. 1. Each external pteygoid process, is thin, flat, and broad, and extends further backwards. Each in- ternal pterygoid procefs is taller and more flender, not fo flat nor broad. It has its end rifing higher than the other, and tipped with a fmall neat hook, named the hook of the pterygoid procefs. The inner pterygoid procefles form the back of the noftrils. The Euftachian tube comes downwards in a wide groove betwixt the two procefles, and then turning its wide mouth towards the noftril, it opens juft behind the internal procefs, viz. behind the noftril, and over the back of the pa- late. The hook of the pterygoid procefs is called the hook of the palate, of which it forms the backmoft point. The mufculus circumflexus vel tenfor palati, * There is foine confuiion in this name, fince pterygoid fignifies aliform, or wing-like proceffes.

2&S MUSCLES OF RESPIRATfoSTj, or tdjjgUes, each of them is fnferted feparately into the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth lower ribs, rrear their cartilages. So that this mufcle, fpreading fo wide out from the centre of motion, has vaft power ; for it has the whole length of the rib as a lever. Its office is to pull the ribs downwards and back- wards ; the effect of which mull be to comprefs tbs cheft, and in certain circumftances to turn the fpine. CXV. The levatores costarum are twelve muk cles on each fide, for the direft purpofe of lifting the ribs; they lie above or upon the ribs, at their angles, and are thence named byfome supra costales. They are almoft a portion of the external intercof- tal mufcles. The firft of the levators arifes from the tranfverfe procefs of the laft vertebra of the neck, and goes down to be inferted into the firft rib, near its tuberofity; and fo all that follow arife from a tranfverfe procefs, and go to the rib below, being very fmall and tendinous at either end. But the three laft levators arife from the fecond procefs above the rib to which they belong. They pafs one rib to go into the one below it: they are confequendy twice as long as the nine firft are; and are therefore named levatores costarum longiores from the ninth dowmwards. Thus the levatores coftarum are a fucceffion of fmall mufcles, arifing from the tranfverfe procefies of the vertebrae, and going to the angles of the ribs; be- ginning from the laft vertebra of the neck, and end- ing with the laft but one of the back. They lie un- der the longiffimus dorfi and facro-lumbalis; and often they have connexions with thefe mufcles, fome- tlmes very clofe. ' CXVI. The

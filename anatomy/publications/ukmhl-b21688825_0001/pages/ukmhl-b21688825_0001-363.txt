and op the DIAPHRAGM. • 31© veffels have degenerated into ligaments in the adult, and the umbilicus is clofed in the form of a ring ; but fometimes it is forced by violent action, and the vifcera come out by it, forming umbilical hernia. 5. The ring of the abdominal muscles is that opening near the lower part of the abdomen, juft over the pubis, through which the fpermatic cord paffes in man, and the round ligament of the womb in women. Cowper (p. 5.) fays, that the fpermatic cord paffes through feparate rings, in each of the three abdominal mufcles; and, like older authors, he makes nature exceedingly wife, in placing the rings, not oppofite to each other, but one high, and another lower, and a third lower ftiil, fo as to prevent the bowels failing out. But the truth is, that neither the internal ob- lique, nor the tranfverfe mufcles, have any fhare at all in the ring, which belongs entirely to the external ob- lique mufcle, and is formed in this way. All the ten- dinous fibres of the external oblique are, like the muf- cle itfelf, oblique, running from above downwards; and the tendinous fafciculi are in fome places wider, a little disjoined from each other, and refembling ftripes crofted by fmall threads of tendon, as if the long fibres were in danger of parting from each other, fo as to leave a gap, and were held together by thefe crofs threads ; and it is in fad a wider and perfect re- paration of two fibres that forms the ring, and a ftronger interlacement of crofs fibres that fecures it from fplitting farther up. But the chief fecurity of • the ring is by the form of the openingfor it is not a ring, as we call it, but a mere fplit in the tendon, which begins about an inch and an half above the pubis, is

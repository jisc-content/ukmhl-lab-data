OF THE TRUNK. no ftand off from each other diftinft and clear ; all which are provifions for a freer motion in the loins. The body of a lumbar vertebra is particularly large, thick, and fpongy ; and its thin outer plate is perforated by many arteries going inwards to nourilh this fpongy fubftance of the bone. The length of the body is an inch, and the interfticial cartilage is nearly as long: fo that the vertebrae of the loins prefent to the eye, looking from within the body, a large thick and maffy column, fit for fupporting fo great a weight. The spinous process is fhort, big, and ftrong. It runs horizontally and directly backwards from the arch of the fpinal marrow. It is flattened, and about an inch in breadth; and it is commonly terminated by a lump or knob, indicating the great ftrength of the mufcles which belong to it, and the fecure hold which they have. The transverse process is alfo fhort, direft, and very ftrong; going off horizontally from the fide of the bone; terminated like the fpinous, by a knotty point, where large mufcles are implanted. The articulating processes of the lumbar ver- tebrae ftand fo directly upwards and downwards, that the name of oblique proceffes cannot be applied here. Of the vertebrae of the back.â€”The character of the vertebrae of the back is directly oppofite to that of the loins. The bodies of the vertebrae are ftill large to fupport the great weight of the trunk ; but they are much longer than in the loins, and their intervertebral fubftance is thin, for there is little motion here. The spinous processes in the vertebrae of the back, are very

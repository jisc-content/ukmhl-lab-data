TH-IGH, LEG, AND FOOT. 15 I roughnefs begins the great rough line, and is what is regularly named the linea afpera. 6. The linea ASPERAis a riling or prominent line, very ragged and unequal, which runs all down the back part of the thigh : It begins at the roots of the two trochanters, and the rough lines'from each troch- anter meet about four inches down the bone; thence tire linea afpera runs down the back of the bone a fmgle line, and forks again into two lines, one going towards each condyle, and ending in the tubercles at the lower end of the bone ; fo that the linea afpera is fmgle in the middle, and forked at either end. 7. The condyles are the two tubers into which the thigh-bone fwells out at its lower part. There is fird a gentle and gradual fwelling of the bone ; then an en- largement into two broad and flat furfaces, which are to unite with the next bone in forming the great joint of the knee. The two tuberqfities, which, by their flat faces, form the joint, fwell out above the joint, and are called the condyles. The inner condyle is larger, to compensate for the oblique pofition of thq thigh-bone ; for the bones are feparated at their heads by the whole width of the pelvis, but are drawn to- wards a point below, fo as to touch each other at the knees. On the fore part of the bone, betwixt the condyles, there is a broad Smooth furface, upon which the rotula, or pulley-like bone glides ; and on the back part of the thigh-bone, in the middle betwixt the condyles, there is a deep notch, which contains the great artery, vein, and nerve of the leg. The great nutritious artery enters below the mid- dle of this bone, and fmaller arteries enter through its l 4 porous

INDIVIDUAL BONES OF TI^E SKULL* 69 the fpace from the, root of the mammillary to the root of the zygomatic procefs. Holes. The temporal bone is perforated with many holes, each of which relates to the organ of hearing ; fome for permitting nerves to enter ; others for letting th'em out; and others for the free palfage of air to the internal ear. 1. The meatus auditorius externus (the circle â€¢of which has been defcribed,) is covered with the membrane of the drum, and communicates the vibra- tory motion of the air for moving and exciting the internal organs. 2. The meatus auditorius internus, is that hole by which the auditory nerves have accefs to the ear. It is a very large hole, feated upon the back of the pars petrofa, which is of a triangular form. The hole is at firft large, fmooth, almoft a regular circle, with a fort of round lip. Within this there are feen many fmall holes, the meaning of which is this : The audi- tory nerve is double from its very origin in the brain : it confifts, in fail, of two diftinit nerves, the portio dura, and the portio mollis. The portio mollis is a large foft and delicate nerve, which conflitutes the true organ of hearing ; and when it is admitted into the ear, it is expanded into a thin web which fpreads over all the cavities of the ear, as the cochlaea, femi* circular canals, &c. The portio dura, the fmaller part of the nerve, paffes indeed through the ear, but it is quite a foreign nerve; it not diftributed within the ear ; it keeps the form of a diftinfl cord, and paf* fing through the temporal bone, it comes out upon the cheek, where it is expanded; fo that the portio f 3

There is fird a great arch on which the body reds, and the heel and the great toe are the horns of that bow : And, fecondly, there is a complete circle among the metatarfal bones, leaving an opening betwixt the adragalus and the os calcis.

The great toe has but two phalanges; the other toes have three ranks of bones, which have nothing particular, only the joints are round and free; formed by a round head on one bone, and by a pretty deep hollow, for receiving it, in the one above it; they are a little flattened on their lower fide, or rather they have a flattened groove which lodges the tendons of the lad joint of the toes. The sesamoid bones are more regularly found about the toes than any where elfe. They are frnall bones, like peafe, found in the hearts of tendons, at any point where they differ much friction; or Tat her they are like the feeds of the fefamum, whence their name.

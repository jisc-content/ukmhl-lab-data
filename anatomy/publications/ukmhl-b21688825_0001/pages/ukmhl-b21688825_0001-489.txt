The joint is ftill further fecured by internal li- gaments, which are within the cavity of the joint $ they are named the crucial ligaments of the knee. They arife betwixt the hollow of the condyles of the thigh-bone, and are implanted into the back part of the middle rifing of the tibia: they lie in the back part of the joint, flat upon the back of the capfule j and the one eroding a little before the other (but yet in contad

MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. 349 betwixt the glutseus minor and the gemini, and its round tendon is inferted betwixt them, fomewhat con- nected with each. The pyriformis, gemini, obturator internus, and quadratus, form what fome anatomifls have called musculi quadragemini; and they are fo much alike in infertion and ufe, that it would be wafte of time to repeat what has been faid of the gemini and obturator. This mufcle, the pyriformis, like the others, rolls the thigh outwards. Its name is from its Ihape. CLXIX. The obturator internus, once named marsupialis or bursalis, arifes from all the internal furface of the obturator ligament, and from all the edges of the thyroid hole, from the ilium, ifchium, and pubis : So it arifes within the pelvis; comes out by turning round the ifchium in the notch betwixt its tuber and its fpine. Its origin is therefore circular and flelhy. It runs along the inflde of the os ifchium, turns round that bone betwixt the fpinous procefs and the tuber. The hollow there is guarded with cartilage ; and this tendon runs in the hollow, like a pulley round a rope; palling this, it runs betwixt the two legs of the gemini, and its tendon is united to theirs ; and the three, appearing almoft like one tendon, are inferted together into the root of the trochanter major. Thefe, then, might with fome propriety be named one mufcle: all the three, viz. the two gemini mufcles and the obturator mufcle, palling between them, were once ac- counted as one mufcle, and then it feemed to be a mufcle with two bellies and an intermediate tendon; and this intermediate tendon, with two flelhy ends, give it the appearance of a purfe, and thence it was named musculus marsupialis, or bursalis.

24^ MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C.- Its ufe, then, is evidently to draw the humerus downwards and backwards, and to perform the fame rotation of the arms which the latiffimus dorfi does. LXXVII. The subscapularis lines all the con- cavity of the fcapula like a culhion. It is like the furface of the fcapula on which it lies, of a triangular fhape; and from the convergence of all the fibres, it is completely radiated or fan-like; it is very flefhy, thick, and ftrong. The radii are each minutely defcribed by Albinus; but Sabbattier fays, with good fenfe, that he cannot diftinguifh them fo as to defcribe them accu- rately; and he might have added, that there was not the fhadow of a motive for wafting time in fo trivial an employment as counting the bundles. It arifes from the two edges, the bafe, and all the internal furface of the fcapula. And indeed it is to favour this origin that the inner furface of the fcapula is full of little rifmgs and hollows, to every one of which the mufcle adheres clofely. Juft under the coracoid procefs is the only part from whence it does not arife. That little fpace is filled up with cellular fubftance. Its alternately tendinous and flefhy fibres are fo rooted in the fcapula, and fo attached to its rifmgs and depreflions, that it is difficultly cleaned away from the bone. 1 The tendon and upper edge of the mufcle is almoft continuous with the fupra fpinatus : but from the man- ner of its infertion, its effedt is very oppofite from that of the fupra fpinatus; for it goes round the os humeri to its infertion, and it is fixed to the leffer tuberofity; therefore it both pulls the arm backwards and down- wards, and performs the rotation like the teres major and

LIGAMENTS, BURS.®, &C. 40J the mufcles and tendons ; ligaments and burfes ; and all the apparatus for the joints; unites them into one whole by a continued tiffue of cellular fubltance, which from part to part through all its various forms, has no interruption, and fuffers no change, but hill preferves its own inanimate nature, while it joins the living parts to each other. The tendons, ligaments, periofteum, and burfe, are all compofed of this cellular fubltance, which by its elafticity binds and connects the par^s, and by its dead and infenfible nature is lefs expofed to difeafe, and is a fitter medium of connection for the living fyftem, OF THE FORMS OF THE CELLULAR SUBSTANCE. Under various modifications and lhapes this dead matter performs molt important offices among the liv- ing parts :—i. It forms cells over all the body, which allow the parts to glide and move eafily j which con- tain the fluid that makes all the motion of parts more eafy and free ; which ftore up fat to fill the interltices, to fupport the parts in their aCtion, to give a plump- nefs to all the body, and to be re-abforbed for the needs and ufes of the fyllem. This cellular fubltance is pe- culiarly ufeful to the mufcles ; dives in among them ; keeps their fibres at fuch due dillance that each may have its action ; fupports and lubricates them ; fo that perhaps the difference of ftrength, in health and difeafe, depends, at lealt in fome degree, upon this fupport. The thinner halitus makes the play of the fibres eafy and free ; and the fat not only fup- ports the fibres in their aftion, but lubricates them D d 3 fo.

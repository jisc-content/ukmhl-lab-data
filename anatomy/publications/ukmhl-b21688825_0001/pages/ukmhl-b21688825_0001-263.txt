LOWER JAW, THROAT, AND TONGUE. 21$ very {lender, reaching from the ihoulder to the os hyoides; it is like thefe laft mentioned, a long flat, ftrap-like mufcle; as flat and as flefhy, but not fo broad, as either of the former. It lies along the fide of the neck ; is pinched in a little in the middle, where it is divided by a tendinous crofs line, which feparates the flefhy belly into two heads. It arifes from the upper edge of the fcapula, near its notch, and is im- planted into the fide of the os hyoides, where the horn goes off from the body of the bone. Thefe three mufcles pull the throat down. The flerno-hyoideus and fterno-thyroideus pull it diredtly downwards : one of the omo-hyoidei adting, pulls it to one fide ; but if both act, they aflifl in pulling directly down, and they brace the trachea at the fame time a little down to the back. The mufcles which move the throat upward are; XXXVII.The mylo-hyoideus, a flat and broadmuf- cle, which arifes from the whole femicircle of the lower jaw, i. e. from the backmoft grinders to the point of the chin. It rifes from the inner furface of the jaw- bone ; goes down to the bafis of the os hyoides; pro- ceeds with very regular, ftraight, clear, and orderly fibres, from the jaw to the os hyoides; is plainly divid- ed in the middle from the fymphyfis of the jaw to the middle of the os hyoides, by a middle tendinous and white line. And though Cowper denies the authority of Vefalius, -who divides it thus, it is plainly two di- ilind mufcles, one belonging to either fide. XXXVIII. The genio-hyoideus is afmall neat pair of mufcles arifing from the chin at a rough point, which is eafily diftinguilhed within the circle of the jaw. The mylo-

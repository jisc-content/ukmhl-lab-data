and / SO OF THE FORMATION clothing, bad air, • or languid health, fhould caufe that dreadful difeafe; when more or lefs heat, during the incubation of a chick, affe&s the growth of its bones; when the ficknefs of a creature during our experi- ments, protracts the growth of callus ; when, in the accidents of pregnancy, of profufe fuppuration, or of languid health, the knitting of broken bones is delay- ed, or wholly prevented. This procefs, fo difficult and flow, is affifted by every provifion of nature. The progrefs of the whole is flow, that as long as the body •increafes in ftature, the bones alfo may grow ; but it is affifted in the in- dividual parts, where fome are flow ; fome rapid in their growth ; fome delayed, as the heads of joints, that their bones may be allowed to extend ; and others haftened, as the pelvis, that they may acquire their perfedt fize early in life. Offification is affifted by the foftnefs of the cartilaginous bed in which the bone is formed; by thofe large and permeable vefiels which carry eaftly the grofler parts of the blood; by a quick and powerful abforption, which all along is modelling the bone ; and, moft of all, by being formed in de- tached points, multiplied and crowded together, wherever much bone is required. There is one central ring firft offified in a long bone, as of the leg or arm; the heads or ends of the bone are at firft mere cartilage, but they alfo foon begin to offify; the body ftretches in a radiated form towards either head; the heads offifying each in its centre, alfo ftretch towards the bone; the heads meet the body, and join to it; a thin cartilage only is interpofed, which grows gradually thinner till the twentieth year,

OF THE TRUNK. 107 1. The General description of a vertebra.â€”The general form, proceffes, and parts of the vertebra, are beft exemplified in a vertebra of the loins; for in it the body is large, the proceffes are right lined, large, and ftrong ; the joint is complete, and all its parts, are very ftrongly marked. Every vertebra confifts of a body, which is firm for fupporting the weight of the body, and hollow behind, for tranfmitting the fpinal marrow; of two articulating precedes above, and two below, by which it is jointed with the bones which are above and below it; of two tranfverfe pro- celfes, which hand out from either fide of the bone, to give hold and purchafe to thofe mufcles which turn the fpine ; and of one procefs, the fpinous procefs, which Hands dire&ly backwards from the middle of the bone ; and thefe proceffes being felt in diffindl points all the way down the back; give the whole the ap- pearance of a ridge; whence it has the name of fpine. 1. The body of the vertebra is a large rnafs of foft and fpongy bone; it is circular before, and flat upon the fides. It is hollowed into the form of a cref- cent behind, to give the fhape of that tube in which the fpinal marrow is contained. The body has but a very thin fcaly covering for its thick and fpongy fub-. ftance. It is tipped with a harder and prominent ring above and below, as a fort of defence, and within the ring the body of the vertebra is hollowed out into a fort of fuperficial cup, which receives the ligamentous fubftance by which the two next vertebrae are joined to it; fo that each vertebra goes upon a pivot, refem- bles the ball and focket-joints ; and in many animals it is diftinftly a joint of this kind.

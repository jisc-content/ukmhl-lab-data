MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION, 256 which are mufcles of the back, and the innumerable fmaller mufcles which lie betwixt the vertebras, belong entirely to the fpine. Refpiration is indeed performed chiefly by the muf- cles of the belly, that is, in ordinary and eafy breath- ing. In high breathing, the difficulty is relieved by the co-operation of almofl: all the mufcles of the trunk; of which there is fcarcely one that may not aflift in fome flight degree. But yet the mufcles of the abdo- men have many other offices. And the mufcles of the fpine, and of the fcapula, again, belong properly to the arm and trunk; and therefore I call thofe the mufcles of refpiration by which the ribs are moved in breathing, and which have no direct relation to almofl: any other motion but merely that of the ribs. The mufcles which are appropriated to the ribs, per- forming no other motion, are, which comes from the and lies flefhy ribs, to pull (_them upwards, f which comes from the I lumbar vertebras, and 2.TheSERRATUSmFERX0R<j ^ fet on ^ ,ower part of the back, to pull the ribs downwards, f which are twelve flat muf- cles, arifing from the tranf* verfe procefs of each ver- tebra, and going down to the rib below, they raife The ribs. f: i.Theserratusposticus • neck, superior, ,> over the POSTICUS, 3.

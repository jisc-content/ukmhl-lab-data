2$0 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. to the radius, and another to the ulna; and it is at laft implanted into that round tubercle which is on the fore part of the radius, a little below its neck. The great ufe of the biceps is to bend the fore-arm; which it does with great ftrength. But as it is in- ferted into the tubercle of the radius, when the arm and hand are turned downwards, the biceps, by act- ing, will pull them upwards, i. e. it will aflift the fupinators. Since both its heads are from the fcapula, it will alfo occaftonally move the humerus, as well as the fore-arm. LXXIX. The brachialis i'ntErnus lies imme- diately under the biceps, and is a very ftrong flelhy mufcle for aflifting the biceps in bending the arm. It is called brachialis from its origin in the fore-arm ; and internus from its being within the biceps, or rather from its being on the inner fide of the arm. It arifes from two thirds of the os humeri at its fore part, by a fort of forked head; for it comes down from each fide of the deltoid. It continues its at- tachment all the way down the fore part of the hume- rus to within an inch of the joint. It is very thick, flelhy, and ftrong ; it is tendinous for about two inches in its fore part; and is inferted by a flat ftrong tendon into the coronoid procefs of the ulna. Other ufes are afcribed to it, as the lifting up the capfule to prevent its being pinched ; but the chief ufe of it is to bend the fore-arm. In a ftrong man, it is exceedingly thick, and its edge proje&s from under the edge of the biceps, and is feen in the lateral view. LXXX.

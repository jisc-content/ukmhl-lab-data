JOINTS OF THE 45° Thus the knee-joint, which is the moil important in all the body ; the moll oppreiTed by the weight of the trunk, and by the accidental loads which we carry; the mod exercifed in the common motions of the body, and the mod liable to docks and blows ; which is the mod fuperficial and the weaked in all that refpe&s its bones—is the dronged in its ligaments, and the mod perfect in all the providons for eafy motion. 1. The great capsule of the joint inclofes the heads of the bone ; fecretes (in part) and contains the fynovia; lines the joint with a fmooth and delicate membrane, and, by turning over all the parts, and adhering to them, it forms the perichondrium for the cartilaginous heads of the bones, and the covering and ligaments for the moving cartilages of the joint. 2. This capfule, which is exquifitely thin, and which was formed for other ufes than for giving drength to the joint, is furrounded on all ddes with fuch continuations of the common fafcia, and fuch particular expanfions of the ham-dring and other mufcles, as by adding outwardly fucceflive layers to the capfule, brings it to a confiderable degree of drength. 3. The capfule having no drefs upon its fore part. Is very thin upon its fore part, viz. at the fides of the patella; but is drengthened at the fides by fair and didin£t ligaments, going from point to point of the three great bones, and fo large and particular as to deferve, more than any others in the body, the name of lateral ligaments ; at the back part of the joint the fame drength is not required as at the fides; yet at mud be dronger than at its fore part, wherefore it is drengthened

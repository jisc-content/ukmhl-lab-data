MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. 2SS a a 2 flelhy Its origin is by a pretty thick and ftrong tendon from the lower and fore part of the trochanter major ; and it continues its origin from the root of the trochanter all down the linea afpera to that rough line which goes to the inner tuberofity of the thigh-bone. It touches the end of the cruraeus about four inches below its origin, and continues attached to it the whole way down; and then it forms a flat tendon which connects itfelf with the tendon of the rectus femoris, and then embraces in a femicircular manner the outfide of the patella. And feveral of the fibres of this aponeurofis not only crofs over the rotula, but go down over its oppofite fide to glide along the head of the tibia, and to be inferted into the inner fide of the knee. CLXXIV. The vastus internus is neither fo large nor fo flelhy as the vastus externus ; but it is ex- ceedingly like it in all other refpefts. It arifes from the fore part of the trochanter minor juft under the infertion of the pfoas magnus j and it continues its origin from the linea afpera tht^whole way down to the inner condyle, exactly oppofite to the origin of the vaftus externus, fo that their origins meet; they leave juft a channel betwixt them. The vaftus internus, very foon after its origin, joins itfelf to the cruraeus, or middle portion, and accompanies it in all its length : and at the diftance of two inches from the rotula it unites itfelf with the tendon of the cruraeus at its in- ternal edge ; and this tendon completes that junction which unites the four mufcles into a quadriceps cruris. This vaftus internus defcends much lower, in a flelhy form, than the external vaftus does j and forms that

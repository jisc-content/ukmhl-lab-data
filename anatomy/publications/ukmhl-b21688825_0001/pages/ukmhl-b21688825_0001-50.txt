OF THE FORMATION their valves, in the flefh of the heart itfelf, or even in the foft and pulpy fubftance of the brain. All the bones of the body, both in the human foe- tus, and in other animals, are merely cartilage before the time of birth. The whole foetus is gelatinous; the bones are a pure, almofl tranfparent and tremulous gelly; they are flexible, fo that a long bone can be bent into a complete ring ; and no opacity, nor fpot of oflification is feen. This cartilage is never hardened into bone; but, from the firfl, it is in itfelf an organized mafs. It has its veflels; which are at firfl tranfparent, but which foon dilate, and whenever the red colour of the blood begins to appear in them, oflification very quickly fol- lows, the arteries being fo far enlarged as to carry the coarfer parts of the blood. The firfl mark of oflifi- cation is an artery, which is feen running into the cen-_ tre of the gelly in which the bone is to be formed. Other arteries foon appear; overtake the firfl; mix with it, and form a net-work of veflels; then a centre of oflification begins, firetching its rays according to the length of the bone, and then the cartilage begins to grow opaque, yellow, brittle ; it will no longer bend, and the fmall nucleus of oflification is felt in the cen- tre of the bone, and when touched with a fharp point, is eafily known by its gritty feeh Other points of of- fification are fucceflively formed ; the oflification being always foretold by the fpreading of the artery, and by the arrival of red blood. Every point of oflification haÂ§ its little arteries, and each oflifying nucleus has fo little dependance on the cartilage in which it is form- ed, that it is held to it by thefe arteries only; and when

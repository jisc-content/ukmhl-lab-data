MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. 357 The rotula is again attached to the tib'a by a ftrong ligament, to fuftain the pulling of thefe great muf- cles *. FLEXORS OF THE LEG. CLXXY. The sartorius or Taylor’s muscle, is fo named from its bending the knees and drawing the legs acrofs. It is the longeft mufcle, and a very beauti- ful one: it extends obliquely acrofs the whole length of the thigh, crofling it like a fillet or garter, about two inches in breadth. It arifes from the upper fpinous procefs of the os ilium, by a tendon about half an inch in length; its thin flat belly extends obliquely acrofs the thigh, like a » ftrap, and is inferted in the fame oblique form into the inner tubercle of the head of the tibia ; its aponeurofis fpreads pretty widely, going over the whole joint of the knee a thin flieet of tendon. From the oblique pofition of the mufcle, it might in adlion change its place; but it is clofely embraced by the fafcia lata, and is tied by fuch adhefions as form fomething like a peculiar fheath of itfelf. * Thefe mufcles are in continual adlion : for theiroffice is to refift the bending of the knee, which would happen by this incumbent weight of the body ; fo that the continual fupport.of the body de-< pends wholly on thefe mufcles: and they are the great agents in running, leaping, walking, &c. Since, by extending the knee, they raife the weight of the pelvis and trunk, and of all the body, they muft be very powerful; and accordingly when they are weighed againft their antagonill mufcle, we find them greatly to exceed ; for the quadriceps, i. e. the reftus, crurceus, and vafti, will weigh four pounds, while the biceps, &c. their antagonifts, weigh but twQ pounds. This experiment was often repeated by the great Cowper for Mr. Brown, who was delivering ledtureson mufcular motion. It AA 3

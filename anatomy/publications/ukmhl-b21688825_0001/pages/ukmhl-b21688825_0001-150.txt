The vertebrae of the loins are five in number, very large and ftrong, and bearing the whole weight of the body. Their precedes ftand out very wide and free, not entangled with each other ; and perform, the chief motions of the trunk. The vertebrae of the back are twelve in number. They alfo are big and ftrong, yet fmaller than thofe of the loins ; their proceffes are laid over each other ; each bone is locked in with the next, and embarraffed by its connection with the ribs ; this is therefore the fteadieft part of the fpine, a very limited motion only is allowed. The vertebrae of the neck are feven in number ; they are more fimple, and like rings; their proceffes hardly proje<ft; they are very ioofe and free; and their motions are the wideft and eafieft of all the fpine. The feven vertebrse of the neck, twelve of the back, and five of the loins, make twentyffour in all, which is the regular proportion of the fpine. But the number fometimes varies according to the proportions of the body ; for where the loins are long, there are fix vertebrse of the loins, and but eleven in the back; or the number of the pieces in the back is fometimes in- creafed to thirteen ; or the neck, according as it is long or fhort, fometimes has eight pieces, oÂ± fometimes only fix.

INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL, J5 Hands out the nasal plate of the sethmcld'bone. It is fometimes called the azygous, or fmgle procefs of the sethmoid, and forms the beginning of that feptum or partition which divides the two noftrils. This prc- cefs is thin, but firm, and compofed of folid bone ; it is commonly inclined a little to one fide, fo as to make the noftrils of unequal ftze. The azygous procefs is united with the vomer, which forms the chief part of the partition ; fo that the feptum, or partition of the nofe, conftfts of this azygous procefs of the sethmoid bone above, of the vomer below, and of the cartilage in the fore or projecting part of the nofe; but the cartilage rots away, fo that whatever is feen of this feptum in the fkull, muft be either of the sethmoid bone or the vomer. 3. Upon either fide of the feptum, there hangs down a spongnY bone, one hanging in each noftril. They are each rolled up like a fcroll of parchment: they are very fpongy ; are covered with a delicate and fen- fible membrane; and when the olfadtory nerves depart from the cribriform plate of the sethmoid bone, they attach themfelves to the feptum, and to thefe upper fpongy bones, and expand upon them fo, that the con- volutions of thefe bones are of material ufe in expand- ing the organ of fmelling, and detaining the odorous eftluvim till the impreffion be perfect. Their convolu- tions are more numerous in the lower animals, in pro- portion as they need a more acute fenfe. They are named fpongy, or turbinated bones, from their convo- lutions, refembling the many folds of a turban. The fpongy bones have a great many honey comb- like cells connected with them, which belong alfo to the organ of fmell, and which are ufeful perhaps by detaining

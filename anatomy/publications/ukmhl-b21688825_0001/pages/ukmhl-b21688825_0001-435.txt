391 OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. as in univerfal palfy, where the vital motions continue entire and perfed, and where the mufcles, though not obedient to the will, are fubjed to irregular and violent adions; and it furvives the connedion with the reft of the fyftem, as where animals very tenacious of life are cut into parts :■—but fenfibility, the property of the nerves, gives the various modifications of fenfe, as vifion, hearing, and the reft; gives all'o the general fenfe of pleafure or pain, and makes the fyftem, ac- cording to its various conditions, feel vigorous and healthy, or weary and low.

The heart, the inteftines, the urinary blad- der, and all the mufcles of voluntary motion, anfwer to ftimuli v/ith a quick and forcible contradion ; and yet they hardly feel the ftimuli by which thefe con- tradions are produced, or at leaft they do not con- vey that feeling to the brain. There is no confci- oufnefs of prefent ftimulus in thofe parts which are called into adion by the impulfe of the nerves, and at the command of the will; fo that mufcular parts have all the irritability of the fyftem, with but little feeling, and that little owing to the nerves which en- ter into their fubftance; while nerves have all the fenfibility of the fyftem, but no motion. The vis insit a is a power that is in continual force, preferving the parts ready for their proper ftimuli, whatever thefe may be; one fet obeying their own peculiar ftimuli chiefly; while others are obedient to the nervous power and the influence of the will.

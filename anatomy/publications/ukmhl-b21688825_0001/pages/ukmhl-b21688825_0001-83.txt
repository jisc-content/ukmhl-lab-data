39 OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL.. the parietal and frontal bones ; fo that in thofe places where the Ikull Ihould be moll regular, we are never fure, and muft, even in the fafeft places, perforate gra- dually and flowly. BONES.—-The bones of which the cranium, or Ikull- cap, is formed, are eight in number, i. The frontal- bone, or bone of the forehead, forms the upper and fore part of the head,—extends a little towards the temples, and forms alfo the upper part of the focket for the eye. 2. The parietal bones, are the two large and flat bones which form all the fldes, and upper part of the head, and are named parietalia, as they are the walls or fldes of the cranium. 3. The os occipitis, is na- med from its forming all the occiput or back of the head ; though much of this bone lies in the neck, and is hidden in the bafis of the Ikull. 4. The ossa tem- po rum form the lower parts of the fldes of the crani- um : they are called temporal, from the hair that co- vers them being the firfl: to turn grey, marking the time of life. 5. The os ^ethmoides, and, 6. the os sphenoides, are quite hidden in the bafls of the fkull: they are very irregular and very difficultly defcribed, or explained. The os ^ethmoides, is a fmall fquare bone, hollow, and with many cells in it; it hangs over the nofe, and conffitutes a great and important part of that organ, and at the fame time fupports the brain. The oifa&ory nerves, by palling through it at many points, perforate it like a fieve ; and it takes its name from this perforated or aethmoid plate. The os sphe- noides, is larger and more irregular ftill; placed fur- ther back ; locked in betwixt the occipital and seth- Ptoidal bones 5 lies over the top of the throat, fo that P its

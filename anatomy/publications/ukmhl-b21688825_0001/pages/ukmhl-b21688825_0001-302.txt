258 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. mon centre; viz. the palmaris, the flexor radialis, the flexor ulnaris, the flexor digitorum fublimis, the flexor digitorum profundus. The palmarisr' longus arifes from the inner condyle of the os humeri, and alfo from the intermufcular tendon, which joins it with the flexor radialis and flexor digitorum fublimis, and from the internal fur- face of the common fheath. Its flefhy belly is but two inches and a half or three inches in length ; and its long flender tendon defcends along the middle of the fore-arm to be inferted into the fore-part of the annular ligament of the wrift, juft: under the root of the thumb. This tendon feems to give rife to the very ftrong thick aponeurofis of the palm of the hind (under which all the mufcles of the hand run, and which conceals the arch of blood veflels, and prote&s them), thence the mufcle has its name. But it is a very common miftake to think, that becaufe tendons are fixed to the fheaths, the fheaths are only produc- tions of the tendons; whereas the fheaths do truly arife from bones. The fafcia, which the deltoides is thought to form, arifes from the acromion and cla- vicle ; and the fafcia, which the biceps is thought to produce, arifes from the condyles of the humerus ; and that great fheath of tendon which is made tenfe by the mufculus fafcialis of the thigh, does not arife from that mufcle, but comes down from the fpine of the ilium, ftrengthened by expanfions from the ob- lique mufcles of the abdomen. In the prefent in- ftance, we have the cleared: proof of fafcia being de- rived from fome other fource than the tendons; for fometimes the palmaris mufcle is awanting, when ftill the

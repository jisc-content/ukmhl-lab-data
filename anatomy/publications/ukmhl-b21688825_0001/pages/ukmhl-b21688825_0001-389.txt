MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-EONE. 345 which leads to the condyle; and the laft fibres of all are Implanted by a tendon of confiderable length into the .condyle itfelf. This addudtor magnus makes, as it were, a flat partition betwixt the fore and the back parts of the thigh ; and it is about three inches above the condyle that the great artery paffes betwixt this tendon and the bone, perforating the triceps, to get from the fore to the back part of the thigh, and down into the ham. The ufe of all thefe mufcles is entirely the fame, making allowance for their various degrees of oblique infertion; and they muft be very powerful, by the great diftance of their origins from the centre of that bone which they move: fo that while other mufcles pull in a direction very oblique, thefe three heads of the triceps mull pull almofi at right angles, the mod favourable direction of all. CLXII. The obturator esternus is named after the obturator ligament, from which it arifes. The li- gament and the mufcles {hutting up the foramen thy- roideumare named obturators; and it is fometimes named rotator femoris EXTRQRSuM,from its turn- ing the thigh outwards. It arifes from the ramus of rhe ifchipm and pubis where they form the margins of the thyroid hole; and from the outer furface of the li- gament, which it occupies entirely, leaving only room for the obturator vefiels and nerves. It is a fhort muf- cle; its origin is broad, and its infertion narrow, fo that it is of a conical form; for the flefli of this mufcle is gathered very foon into a round Ihort tendon, which iwifts under the thigh-bone betwixt it and the pelvis > fo that it is in a manner rolled round the thigh-bone, be-

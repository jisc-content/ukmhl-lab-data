AND GROWTH OF BONES. 19 the bone rifes up like a new property of its nature : and as the eye, the fltin, and all feeling parts, have their fenfibility increafed by difeafe, the bones, liga- ments, burfe, and all the parts whofe feeling, during health, is obfcure and hardly known, are roufed to a degree of fenfibility far furpafling the foft parts. The wound of a joint is indeed lefs painful at firft, but when the inflammation comes, its fenfibility is raifed to a dreadful degree: the patient cries out with an- guifli. No pains are equal to thofe which belong to the bones and joints. Thus oflification is a procefs of a truly animal na- ture : no coagulation will harden cartilage into bone ; no change of confiftency will convert the blood into it ; no condenfation of the periofteum can aflimilate it to the nature of a bone: Bone is not the inorganic con- crete which it was once fuppofed ; but it is a regularly organifed part, whofe form fubfifts from the firft; and which is perfected by its fecreting arteries, balanced, as in every fecretion, by the abforbents of the part; it lives, grows and feels; is liable to accidents, and fubjeft to difeafe. It is a procefs which, at firft, ap- pears fo rapid, that we Ihould expeft it to be foon complete; but it becomes in the end a flow and diffi- cult procefs. It is rapid at firft ; it advances flowly after birth ; it is not completed in the human body till the twentieth year; it is forwarded by health and ftrength, retarded by weaknefs and difeafe. In fcrofula it is imperfect; and fo children become rick- ety, the bones foftening and fvvelling at their heads, and bending under the weight of the body. And why fhould we be furprifed, that careleflnefs of food or c 2 clothing,

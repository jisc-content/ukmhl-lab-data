THICH, LEG, AND FOOT. 157 by the fafcia, or tendinous expanfion of the thigh ; but above all, by the tendons of the outer hamftrings be- ing fixed into this knot of the fibula, and expanding from that over the fore part of the tibia. The lower head of the fibula is let pretty deep into a focket on the fide of the tibia ; together, they form the ankle joint for receiving the bones of the foot. The ankle joint is one of the pureft hinge joints, and is very fecure; for there is the tibia, at the procefs of the inner ankle, guarding the joint within; there is the fibula palling the joint ftill further, and making the outer ankle ftill a ftronger guard without. Thefe two points, projecting fo as to enclofe the bones of the foot, make a pure hinge; prevent all lateral mo* tion ; make the joint firm and ftrong ; and will not al- low of luxations till one or both ankles be broken. We know that there is little motion betwixt the tibia and fibula; none that is fenfible outwardly, and no more in truth than juft to give a fort of elafticity, yielding to flighter drains. But we are well allured, that this motion, though flighted and imperceptible, is very conftant; for thefe jointings of the fibula with the tibia are always found fmooth and lubricated ; and there are no two bones in the body fo clofely connected as the tibia and fibula are, which are fo feldom anchylofed, i. e. joined into one by difeafe. The fibula may be thus defined : It is a long {len- der bone, which anfwers to the double bone of the /ore arm, completes the form, and adds fomewhat to the ftrength of the leg; it gives a broader ori- gin for its ftrong mufcles; lies by the fide of the tibia

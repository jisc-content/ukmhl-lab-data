49 OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL. E VOL. 1. The difeafe ; it clofes very late in rickets ; and in hydroce- phalic children the bones never clofe, but continue foft, yield to the watery fvvelling of the brain, and fe- parate in a wonderful degree, fo as to hold ten or twelve pounds. As the futures continue open in a hydrocephalic child, they are faid to open again in the few inftances where adults are feized with the fame difeafe. We are told that it opens in thofe dreadful headaches which are fometimes fatal, and that the celebrated Pafchal having died after terrible torments, was found to have the futures opened again. It is even faid that they open during difeafe, and clofe after the cure : “ That a *c man of forty years of age being in the dog-days feiz- “ ed with a raging fever, delirium, watching, and dread- “ ful pains of the head, his futures opened on the fe- “ venth day, were as wide as in a child ; not only fo as <c to be diftinguilhed by the finger, but that the at- “ tendants could fee the pulfations of the brain: the “ fever, after fome time, abated ; the pains ceafed ; the “ futures clofed, and this man lived many years in per- “ feft health.” So Hildanus reports the cafe ; and he alfo fays, in another inftance, that the futures had part- ed in a violent hemicrania, with an audible node. Yet, if this were a regular defign of nature, the re- lief Ihould be perfect ; perhaps the opening of the fu- tures fhould be more eafy, and the accident almolf as common as difeafes of the head: or perhaps it had been the more merciful order, to have determined a quick and fudden period for fuch dreadful and incu- rable difeafes as thefe.

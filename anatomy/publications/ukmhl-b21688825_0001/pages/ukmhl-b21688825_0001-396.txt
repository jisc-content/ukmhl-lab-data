352 MUSCLES MOVING TÂ£E thigh-bone* magnus, and triceps mufcles, co-operate, agree with the glutaei mufcles in bringing the trunk forwards to fol- low the limb, and then in fixing and ftiffening the trunk upon that limb, till the other thigh is advanced a fecond Hep before the body. The muscles of the leg are the moll fimple of all: for the knee is a mere hinge, at leaf!; it is fo in all our ordinary motions; fo that there is no action to be per- formed but thofe of mere flexion and extenfion ; and there are only two clafies of mufcles to be defended, the extenfors and the flexors of the leg. 1. The extensors of the leg. The only mufcles which extend the leg are thofe four, which may be very fairly reckoned a quadriceps extenfor cruris. Indeed the French anatomifts arrange them fo. Sab- batier calls them the triceps femoris. Thefe mufcles, which all converge to the patella, and are inferted ill it, are: Reftus Femoris, Vaftus Externus, Cruraeus vel Femoraeus, Vaftus Interims* And thefe are all implanted by one tendon; becaufe the joint being a hinge, bending only in one direction, its mufcles could have given but one motion, however oblique their origin and courfe had been. 2. The flexors of the leg are one on the outfide and four on the infide of the leg ; the tendons of the outfide being implanted into the upper knob of the fibula, and thofe in the infide into the rough head of the tibia, forming the hamftrings, and extending their . tendons or aponeurotic expanfion downwards upon the leg.

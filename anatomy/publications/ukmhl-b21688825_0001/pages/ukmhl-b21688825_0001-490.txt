446 JOINTS OF THE contact with each other at the place of crofting), they are diftinguifhed by the names of anterior and Posterior crucial ligaments. The posterior crucial ligament is more perpen- dicular ; it arifes from the hollow betwixt the con- dyles of the thigh-bone, and is implanted into a roughnefs on the back of the tibia, betwixt its two cup-like hollows, and behind the tubercle which di- vides thefe hollows from each other. While the pos- terior arifes rather from the internal condyle, the anterior ligament arifes properly from the external condyle, paftes obliquely over the tuber in the arti- culating Surface of the tibia, and terminates in the cup-like hollow. The eftfedt of thefe two ligaments is more particular than is commonly obferved ; for the one goes obliquely out over the articulating Surface of the tibia, while the other goes direfUy down behind the joint; and of courfe when the knee is bended, the pofterior ligament is extended; when the leg is ftretched out, the anterior ligament is extended : they both are checks upon the motions of the joint: the anterior ligament prevents the leg going too far for- wards; the pofterior ligament prevents its being too much bent back upon the thigh. 4. The moft admirable part of the mechanifm of this joint is the two semilunar caritilages. They are fo named from their femilunar form: they lie upon the top of the tibia, fo as to fill up, each of them, one of the hollows on the top of that bone. They are thick- er towards their convex edges, thinner towards their concave edges; they end by two very acute and long horns, named the cornua of the lunated cartilages. In

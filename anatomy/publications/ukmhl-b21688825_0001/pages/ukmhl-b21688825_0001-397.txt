The rectus femoris, fometimes rectus cruris, is fo named from its direction : it is a thin fiat mufcle, and arifes by two heads. The firit or greater head arifes from the lower fpinous procefs of the ili- um by a fiiort round tendon ; its fecond head is in -a different and in fomewhat of a curved direction : for it comes from the head of the acetabulum and from the capfular ligament. Thefe join together, and form a flat tendon of four inches in length, which becomes gradually flefhy and larger down to its middle, and then agains contraÂ£ts towards the patella in the fame gradual manner. There is a middle tendinous line running the whole length of the mufcle, efpecially confpicuous on its back part: and towards that cen- tral line all the mufcular fibres converge. The re&us is united at the fides to the vafti; at the back part to the crurseus; and its tendon, along with that of the crurseus, goes to be direftly implanted into the jrotula of the knee. The redtus cruris is the firfl of thofe mufcles which Sabbatier calls the triceps femoris ; and furely they may be as properly named thus as the triceps cubiti EXTENSOR. VOL. I. A A This

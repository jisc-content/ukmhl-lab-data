SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. l8/ 7. The os magnum is named from its great fize; not that it is the larged of all, nor even the larged bone of the fecond row, for the cuneiform bone is as big ; but there is no other circumdance by which it is well didinguifhed. It is placed in the centre of the upper row, has a long round head, which is jointed chiefly with the lunated hollow of the os lunare ; and this big head, and lunated hollow, make together a fort of focket, by which the fecond row moves upon the fird. 8. The os unciforme, or hook-like bone,is named from a flat hook-like procefs, which projects towards the palm of the hand. This is one of the corner bones, and danding in the end of the row, it is wedg- ed betwixt the os magnum of its own row, and the os cuneiforme of the fird row. It is large and fquared ; but the thing chiefly remarkable is that procefs from which it takes its name; a long and flat procefs of firm bone, fairly unciform, or hook-like, and projecting far into the palm of the hand, which being the lad and highed of the corner points, gives a very firm origin to the great ligament by which the tendons of the wrid are bound down. All thefe bones of the carpus, when they are joined to each other, are covered with a fmooth articulating cartilage; are bound to each other by all forms of crofs ligaments ; and are confolidated, as it were, into one great joint. They are, in general, fo firm as to be fcarcely liable to luxation; and although one only is called cuneiform, they are all fomewhat of the wedge- like form, with their broader ends outwards, and their fmaller ends turned towards the palpi of the hand; they

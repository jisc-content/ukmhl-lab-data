3 AND GROWTH OF RONES. had feen the juice that exuded from a fplit in a bone, co- agulate into a bony cruft; and it was thought to be par- ticularly well afcertained, that callus was but a coagu- lable juice, which might be feen exuding directly from the broken ends of a bone, and which gradually coagu- lated into hard bone. The beft phyftologifts did not fcruple to believe, that bones, and the callus of bro- ken bones, were formed of a bony juice, which was de- pofited by the veffels of the part, and which paifmg through all the fucceflive conditions of a thin unco- agulated juice, of a tranfparent cartilage, and of foft and flexible bone, became at laft, by a flow coagula- tion, a firm, hard, and perfeft bone ; depending but little upop veffels or membranes, either for its genera- tion or growth, or for nourifliment in its perfect ftate. But this coagulation is a property of dead matter, which has no place in the living fyftem; or if blood or mucus do ever coagulate within the body, it is only after they are feparated from the fyftem. Coagulation is a fort of accident in the living body; and it is not to be believed that the accidental concourfe of parts fhould form the perfect fyftem of a living bone ; nor that coa- gulation, an irregular uncertain procefs, fhould keep pace with the growth of the living parts; that a bone which is completely organized, and a regular part of the living fyftem, fhould, in all its progrefs towards this perfect ftate, be merely inanimate, inorganized matter: Yet this opinion once prevailed ; and if other theories were at that time propofed, they did not vary in any very effential point from this firft notion. De Heide, a furgpon of Amfterdam, believed that bene or callus were not formed from a coagulable juice, but from the b 2 blood

MUSCLES MQVING THE TOES. 373 fome it is confidered as a diftindt mufcle, and as the origin and firlt beginning of the lumbricales pedis. Thus Cowper confiders the mafia carnea and the lumbricales as one and the fame ; that the mafia car^* nea joins the tendon, covers it with its flelh, continues flelhy along the common tendon, till at the bifurca- tion it alfo parts, along with the four tendons, into four fmall flelhy mufcles, which are called lumbricales. Albinus, again, paints the mafia carnea diftinfitly terminating at the common tendon, and the lumbri- cales as ariftng diftjnct from each of the divided ten. dons. CXCI. The flexor brevis mgitorum is alfo na- med the flexor fubiimis or perforatus. It arifes from the lower part of the heel-bone, or the bump upon which we Hand. It arifes by very fhort tendinous fibres ; and being placed immediately under the plantar aponeu- rofis, it takes hold of it, and alfo of the tendinous par- titions betwixt it and the two abductors of the fmall and of the great toe, which are on either fide of it. Under the metatarfal bones it divides itfelf into four heads ; their tendons begin earlier upon the fide next the foot; they grow round ; emerge from betwixt the dentations of the plantar aponeurofis ; they then pafs into the vagina or Iheath of each toe; and on this, the firlt phalanx, they lie over the tendons of the long extenfors. About the root of this firlt bone they di- vide into two little bands, which form a fplit (like the perforatus of the fingers) for the paflage of the long tendon. The long tendon pafles through it upon the fecond joint pf the toe ; and immediately after the perforated b b 3 tendon

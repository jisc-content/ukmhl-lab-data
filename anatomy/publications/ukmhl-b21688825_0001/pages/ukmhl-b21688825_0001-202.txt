Bones of the tibia like a fplint; and, being a little arched to- wards the tibia, fupports it againfl thofe accidents which would break it acrofs, and maintains the form of the leg when the tibia is carious or broken ; the fi- bula, though it has little connection with the knee, pafles beyond the ankle joint, and is its chief guard and ftrength in that direction in which the joint fhould be mod apt to yield; and in this office of guarding the ankle, it is fo true, that the ankle cannot yield till this guard of the fibula be broken. Rotula or patella, or knee-fan, is a fmall thick bone, of an oval, or rather triangular form# The ba- fis of this rounded triangle is turned upwards to re- ceive the four great mufcles which extend the leg, the pointed part of this triangle is turned downwards, and is tied by a very flrong ligament to the bump or tubercle of the tibia, juft under the knee. This liga- ment is called the ligament of the patella, or of the tibia, connecting the patella fo clofely, that fome ana- tomifts of the firfl: name choofe to fpeak of the patella as a mere procefs of the tibia, (as the olecranon is a procefs of the ulna), only flexible and loofe; an ar- rangement which I think fo far right and ufeful, as the fraCtures of the olecranon and of the patella are fo much alike, efpecially in the method of cure, that they may be fpoken of as one cafe ; for thefe two are the only" exceptions to the common rules and methods of fetting broken bones* The patella is manifeflly ufeful, chiefly as a lever; for it is a pulley, which is a fpecies of lever, gliding txpon the forepart of the thigh-bone upon the fniooth furface which is betwixt the condyles.

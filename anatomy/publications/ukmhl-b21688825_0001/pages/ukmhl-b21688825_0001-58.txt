14 OF THE FORMATION the body is not now the fame individual body that it was ; but it could not be eafily believed that we fpeak only by guefs concerning the fofter parts, what we know for certain of the bones. It was difcovered by chance, that animals fed upon the refufe of the dyerV vats, received fo much of the colouring matter into the fyftem, that the bones were tinged by the madder to a deep red, while the fofter parts were unchanged; no tint remaining in the ligaments nor cartilages ; in the mem- branes, velfels, nor nerves; not even in the delicate vef- fels of the eye. It was eafy to diftinguifh by the micro- fcope, that fuch colour was mixed with the bony matter, and refided in the interfaces only, but did not remain in the velfels of the bone, which like thofe of all the bo- dy had no tinge of red ; while our injections again fill the velfels of the bone, make all their branches red, but do not affect the colours of the bony part. When madder is given to animals, withheld for fome time, and then given again, the colour appears in their bones; is removed; and appears again, with fuch a fudden change as proves a rapidity of depofition and abforption ex- ceeding all likelihood or belief. All the bones are tinged in twenty-four hours : in two or three days their colour is very deep : and if the madder be left olf but for a few days, the red colour is entirely removed. This tinging of the bones with madder, was the great inltrument employed by Du Hamel, for prov- ing by demonftration, that it was by layers from the periofteum that the bone was formed ; and how very far the mind is vitiated by this vanity of ellablifhing a do&rine on fads, is too eafily feen here. As Du Ha- mel believed that the periofteum depofited fuccelfive layers.

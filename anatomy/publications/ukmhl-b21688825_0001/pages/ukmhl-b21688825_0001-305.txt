MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. S6l which arifes flefliy; and as the radial nerve paffes betwixt the heads of the pronator teres, the ulnar nerve perforates this mufcle betwixt its heads. The flexor ulnaris paffes all along the flat fide of the ulna, betwixt the edge of the fublimis and the ridge of the bone: and here it has a third origin of oblique fibres, which come from the edge of the ulna two-thirds of its length. Its tendon begins early on its upper part, by which it has fomewhat the form of a penniform mufcle. It has flill a fourth origin from the inter- mufcular partition, which (lands betwixt it and the fublimis flexor; and is alfo attached to the internal furface of the common fafcia of the arm. Its long tendon is at lad inferted into the os pififorme at its fore-part, where it fends off a thin tendinous expan- fion to cover and ftrengthen the annular ligament; and alfo a thin expanfion towards the fide of the little finger to cover its mufcles. This,is to balance the flexor radialis: acting together, they bend the wrift with great ftrength; and when this afts alone, it pulls the edge of the hand fidewife. LXXXVII. The flexor digitorum sublimis, is named sublimis from being the more fuperficial of the two mufcles; perforatus, from its tendon being per- forated by the tendon of that which lies immediately below. It lies betwixt the palmaris longus and flexor ulnaris. It is a large flefhy mufcle; and not only its tendons, but its belly alfo, is divided into four fafciculi, correfponding with the fingers which it is to ferve. It arifes from the internal condyle, along with the other four mufcles; from the ligament of the elbow joint j from the coronoid procefs of the ulna; and s 3 from

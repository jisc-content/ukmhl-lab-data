*35 OF THE TRUNK. the great mufcles that move the thighs, and to its edge are fixed thofe broad fiat mufcles which form the walls of the abdomen. This flat upper part is named the ala, or winc, while the lower, or rounder partf is named the body of the bone, where it enters into the focket, and meets the other bones. The ala, or flat expanded wing, has many parts, which muff be well remembered, to underhand the mufcles which arife from them. i. The whole circle of this wing is tipt with a ridge of firmer bone, which encircles the whole. This is a circular cartilage in the child, diflindl from the bone, and is ofiified and fixed only at riper years. All this ridgy circle is called the fpine, and is the origin for the lower oblique and tranf- verfe mufcles of the abdomen. 2. The two ends of this fpine are abrupt, and the points formed upon it areconfe- quently named fpinous procefles; of which there are two at its fore, and two at its back end. The two posterior spinous processes are clofe by each other, and are merely two rough projecting points near the rough fur- face, by which the os ilium is joined to the os facrumj they jut out behind the articulation, to make it firm and fare ; and their chief ufes feem to be the giving a firm hold to the ftrong ligaments which bind this joint, 3. The two anterior fpinous procefles are more diftindt and more important marks ; for the anterior supe- rior spinous PROCESsis the abrupt ending of the fpine or circle of the ilium, with a fwelling out; from which jutting point the fartorious mufcle, the longefl and amongfl the mold beautiful in the human body, goes obliquely acrofs the thigh, like a ftrap, down to the knee; another, which is called the tenfor vaginae fe- lt 4^ moris.

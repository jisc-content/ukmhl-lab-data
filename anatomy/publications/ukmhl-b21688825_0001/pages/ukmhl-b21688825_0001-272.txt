Muscles of the 228 many irregular origins. The conflridor might-fairly enough be explained as one mufcle, but the irregular origins fplit the fibres of the mufcle, and give occafion of dividing the conftri&or into diftinft pr rts ; for one bundle arifing from the occipital bone and os petro- fum from the tongue, the pterygoid procefs, and the two jaw bones, is diftinguifhed as one mufcle, the con- ftriÂ£tor fuperior Another bundle arifing from the os hyoides, is named the conftri&or medius f. A third bundle, the lowed; of the three, arifing, from the thy- roid and cricoid cartilages, is named the conftri&or inferior J. LIV. The constrictor superior, arifing from the bafis of the fkull, from the jaws, from the palate, and from the root of the tongue, furrounds the upper part of the pharynx ; and it is not one circular mufcle, but two mufcles- divided in the middle line behind, by a diftinct rapha, feam, or meeting of the oppofite fibres. x LV. The constrictor medius rifes chiefly from the round point in which the os hyoides terminates; it alfo arifes from the cartilage of the os hyoides (i. e.) where the horns are joined to the body. The tip of the horn being the moll prominent point, and the cen- tre of this mufcle, it goes upwards and downwards, fo as to have fomething of a lozenge-like fhape y it lies * Thefe good opportunities of names have not been difregarded : tliis mufcle has been named cephalo-pharyngeus, pterig/O- PHARYNGEUS, MYLG-PHARYNGEUS, GLOSSO-PHARYNGEUS. -j- This one is ramed hyo-pharyngeus, or syndesmo-pharyh- geus, from its origin in the cartilage alfo of the os hyoides. J This, of courfe, is named tuyro-pharyngeus, and crico- pharyngeus. over

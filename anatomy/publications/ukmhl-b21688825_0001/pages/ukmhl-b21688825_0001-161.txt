And, 5. We fee on either fide of this tooth- like procefs a broad and flat articulating furface, one on either fide. Thefe articulating'furfaces are placed like fhoulders; and the atlas being threaded by the tooth-like procefs of the dentatus, is fet flat down upon the high fhoulders of this bone, and there it turns and performs all the rotatory motions of the head. OF THE MEDULLARY TUBE, AND THE PASSAGE OF THE NERVES.-â€”All the vertebra; conjoined make a large canal of a triangular or round- ifh form, in which the fpinal marrow lies, giving off and diftribliting its nerves to the neck, arms, and legs : And the whole courfe of the canal is rendered fafe for the marrow, and very fmooth by lining membranes 5 the outermofi: of which is of a leather-like flrength and thicknefs, and ferves this double purpofe, that it is at once a hollow ligament, the whole length of the fpine upon which the bones are threaded, and by which each individual bone is tied and fixed to the next; and it is alfo a vagina or {heath which contains the fpinal mar- row, and which is bedewed on its internal furface with a thin exudation, keeping the fheath moifl and foft, and making the enclofed marrow lie eafy and fafe. All down the fpine this fpinal medulla is giving off its nerves. One nerve paffes from it at the inter- ftice of each vertebra $ fo that there are twenty-four 1 3 nerves

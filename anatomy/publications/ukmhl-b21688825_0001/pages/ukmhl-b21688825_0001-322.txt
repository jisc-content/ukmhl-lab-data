278 MUSCLES OP THE ARM, &C. MUSCLES SEATED ON THE HAND. Besides thofe mufcles which bend and extend the fingers, there are other fmaller ones feated on the hand i'tfelf, which are chiefly for a {lifting the former, and for quicker motions; but mofl efpecially for the lateral motions of the thumb and little-finger; and which are therefore named adductors, abductors, and flexors, of the little-finger and thumb. That they are chiefly ufeful in aflifting and ftrengthening the larger mufcles, is evident from this, that much power being required for flexion, we find many of thefe fmaller mufcles added in the palm of the hand: but as there is little power of extenfion needed, little more than what will merely balance the power of the flexors, there are no fmall mufcles on the back of the hand, the interoflfaei externi excepted, which are chiefly ufeful in fpreading the fingers. The fhort mufcles in the palm of the hand are for bending the thumb, the fore-finger, and the little- finger : and the little finger and the thumb have each of them three diftinft mufcles ; one to pull the thumb away from the hand, one to bend it, and one to pull it towards the hand, oppofing it to the reft of the fingers, and fo of the little finger, which has alfo three muf- ■ cles.

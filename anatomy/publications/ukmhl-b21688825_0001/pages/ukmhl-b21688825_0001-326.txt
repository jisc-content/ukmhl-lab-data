282 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. CVI. The adductor pollicis arifes from the me- tacarpal bone of the middle finger, where it has a flat extended bafe. It goes from this dire&ly acrofs the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger to meet the thumb. It is of a triangular fhape, and flat: Its bafe is at the metacarpal bone; its apex is at the thumb: It is in- ferted into the lower part or root of the firft phalanx * Its edge ranges with the edge of the flexor brevis: It concurs with it in office ; and its more peculiar ufe is to draw the thumb towards the fore-finger, as in pinching. Thus do thefe mufcles, covering the root of the thumb, form that large and convex ball of flefh which ads fo ftrongly in almoft every thing we do with the hand. The ball of the thumb is fairly furrounded : it is almofl one mafs, having one office: but as the del- toides will, in fome circumflances, pull the arm down- wards, fome portions of this fleffiy mafs pull the thumb outwards obliquely; fome directly inwards: but the great mafs of mufcle bends the thumb, and oppofes it to the hand; and as this one mufcle is to oppofe the whole hand, the ball of flefh is very power- ful and thick. The fhort mufcles of the little-finger furround its root, juft as thofe of the thumb furround its ball. CVII. The abductor minimi digiti is a thin flefhy mufcle, which forms the cufhion on the lower edge of the hand, juft under the little-finger. It is an ex- ternal mufcle: It arifes from the os pififorme, and from the outer end of the annular ligament. It is inferted laterally into the firft bone of the little-finger; but

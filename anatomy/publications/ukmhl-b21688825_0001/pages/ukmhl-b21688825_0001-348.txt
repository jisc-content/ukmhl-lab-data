304 MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. cept the uppeftnofl. This mufcle is very llender and long, and confifls fully more of tendon than of flefh : it has five feet below, rifing from the lower fpines of the back and loins; and. nine feet above, implanted into the upper fpines of the back. Its aftion mufl raife the fpine; but perhaps it may be equally ufeful ,as a mufcular and tendinous ligament. CXXXII. The semi-spinal is dorsi arifes from the tranfverfe proceffes of the lower vertebrae of the back all but two ; and is implanted into the upper fpinous proCeffes of the back, and into the firft fpine of the neck *. CXXXIII. The multifidus spin^e runs from the facrum along all the fpine to the vertebrae of the neck; and is a comprehenfive and true way of de- fcribing many irregular portions of flefh, which authors have divided into cliftinft mufcles f. It is a continued flefhy indentation, from tranfverfe procefs to fpine, through all the vertebras of the back, neck, and loins. It begins both tendinous and flefhy from the upper convex furface of the os facrum, which is rough with fpines from the adjoining part of the ilium; and in the loins it arifes from oblique proceffes; in the back, from tranfverfe proceffes; and again from oblique proceffes among the cervical vertebras. Its origin in the loins is clofe to the fpine; being * This is of courfe the transverso-spinalis dorsi ofWinflow. f Transverso-spinalis lilmborum veterib. sacer ; SEMI- SPINANIS INTERNETS, five TRANSVERSO-SPINALIS DORSI; SEMI- spinalis, five transverso-spinalis colli, pars interna.— Window.

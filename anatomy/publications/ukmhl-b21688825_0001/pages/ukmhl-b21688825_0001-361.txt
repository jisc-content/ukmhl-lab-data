AND OF THE DIAPHRAGM. 3T7 late to the penis, or by Fallopius to belong to the uri- nary bladder, their true ufe is only to aflift the reftus to draw down the fternum, and tighten the linea alba? and fo to give greater power to the oblique and tranf- verfe mufcles. The pyramidalis is fo irregular a mufcle, that fometimes two are found on one fide and none at all on the other. Sometimes two on each fide, fome- times there is but one, and very often they are awanting., the belly of the reftus coming quite down to the pubis. 1. The linea alba is the common meeting of all the thin flat tendons ; and therefore we call it their in- fertion, being the common point towards which they all aft : it is white, by the gathering of ail the colour- lefs tendons. 2. The linea semilunaris is a line of the fame white appearance, of a circular form, and produced by the meeting of all the tendons, on the edge of the rec- tus mufcle, to form a fheath for it. 3. The sheath for the rectus muscle does not admit of fo brief a definition as thefe : It has been com- monly fuppofed to be formed in a very curious manner, chiefly by the broad tendon of the obliquus internus, which being the central mufcle betwixt the two other layers, is fuppofed to have its tendon fplit into two thin fheets; that the outermofl flieet adheres to the outer oblique mufcle, forming the outer part of the fheath, while its inner fheet adheres to the tendon of the tranfverfe mufcle, forming the inner part of the fheath: but this is too intricate, and can hard- ly be proved by diflfeftion. Cowper expreffes his doubts about the doftrine of the tendon of the in- ner oblique mufcle being fplit into two layers; and I think

OF THE TRUNK. I09 projedts. Now thefe fpinous, and the tranfverfe pro- cefles, are fo many handles and levers by which the fpine is to be moved ; which, by their bignefs, give a firm hold to the mufcles; and, by their length, give them a powerful lever to work their effedts by. The fpinous procefles, then, are for the infertion of thefe mufcles which extend and raife the fpine. 4. The transverse processes Hand out from the fides of the arms or branches which form this arch. They Hand out at right angles, or tranfverfely from the body of the bone; and they alfo are as levers, and long and powerful ones for moving and turning the fpine. Perhaps their chief ufe is not for turning the vertebra; for there is no provifion for much of a lateral motion in the lower part of the fpine, but the mufcles which are implanted into thefe are more commonly ufed in aflifting thofe which extend and raife the fpine. Thefe, and all the procefles, are more diftindt, pro- minent, and ftrong, more diredt, and larger in the loins, and more eafily underflood, than in the vertebra of any other clafs. But this prepares only for the de- fer ip tion of the individual vertebra, where we find a variety proportioned to the various offices, and to the degrees of motion which each clafs has to perform. Of the vertebra of the loins.â€”I have chofen to reprefent the general form of a vertebra, by de- feribing one from the loins, becaufe of the diftindlnefs with which all its parts are marked. In the lumbar vertebra, the perpendicular height of the body is fhort; the intervertebral fubftance is thicker than in the other parts of the fpine; and the feveral procefles Hand

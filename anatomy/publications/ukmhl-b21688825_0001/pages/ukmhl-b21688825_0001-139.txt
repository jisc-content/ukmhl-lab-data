OE THE f ACE AND JAWS. 95 3. The fame level with the palatal procefs of the jaw-bone, which it refembles in its rough and fpinous furface ; in its thinnefs ; in its being thinner in the middle, and thicker at either end; in its being oppofed to its fel- low by a broad furface, which completes the middle palate suture ; and it is connected with the palate procefs of the jaw, by a future refembling that by which the oppofite bones are joined; but this future going acrofs the back part of the palate, is named the transverse palate suture. Where the two palate bones are joined, they run backwards into an acute point; on either fide of that middle point, they make a femicircular line, and again run out into two points behind the grinding teeth of each fide. By this figure of the bones, the back line of the palate has a fcclloped or waved form. The velum palati, or cur- tain of the palate, is a little arched, following the ge- neral line of the bones *, the uvula or pap hangs ex- aftly from the middle of the velum, taking its origin from the middle proje&ing point of the two bones; and a fmall mufcle, the azygus uvulae, runs down in the middle of the velum, taking its origin from this middle point. 2. The fmall projecting point of the palate bone, juft behind the laft grinding tooth, touches the ptery- goid procefs of the fphenoid bone; it is therefore named the pterygoid process of the palate bone ; but it is fo joined with the pterygoid procefs of the fphenoidal bone, that they are not to be diftinguifhed in'the en- tire Ikull. The pcfterior pterygoid hole, or third hole of the palate, is juft before this point,,

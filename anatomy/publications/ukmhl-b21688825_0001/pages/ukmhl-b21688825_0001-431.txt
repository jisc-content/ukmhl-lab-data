OF THE MUSCULAR POWER, 387 confiding of fix cylindrical fibres involved in a fpiral one, a third reckoned the fibres a fucceffion of fphe- rical bodies ; and Cowper thought that he was inject- ing with quickfilver chains of bells jointed with each other. For the honour of the age, thefe vanities are forgotten now. And why, indeed, Ihould we feek the ultimate fibres of the mufcle, or dudy their forms, when the difcovery could not advance us one fingle dep in the knowledge of its nature or eflence ? What avails it, that we have difcovered (if we have really difcovered) the fhape of the particles of the blood; the wave-like fibres within the fubdance of the nerves; or the jointed appearance in the fmaller fibres of muf- cles ? We do not underdand the nature of the blood, the properties of the nerves, nor the contractile power of the mufcles, at all better by the knowledge of this peculiar form of the internal drudture, than we do by the grofler. marks of their external form. Phyfiologids have, by a late fenfe of their own weak- nefs, been at lad humbled to this becoming, but un- willing acknowledgment, that this contractility of die mufcles is an original endowment of this living matter derived from the Creator; imparted in a way which we cannot know ; and fo attached to the organization of the mufcular fibre, that when its organization is de- droyed, this power is lod. We have refigned the fearch after a mechanical or phyiical caufe, and feek only to learn the properties of this living power, and the excitements by which it is moved. To this end it is necefiary to define this power, didinguifhing it from thofe feelings or motions which refult from the nerves. The vis infita being that power which be- C c 2 longs

Superior auris is named attollens, be- caufe it lifts the ear upwards: it is a very thin, flat, expahfion, which can hardly be diftinguifhed from the fafcia of the temporal mufcles, upon which it lies; it arifes broad and circular from the expanded tendon of the occipito-frontalis, and is inferted narrow into the root of the cartilaginous tube of the ear. XVIII. Anterior auris is a very delicate, thin, and narrow expanflon ; ariflng about the zygoma, or rather from the fafcia with which the zygoma is co- vered ; it is implanted round the cartilaginous tube, at its root f. XIX. The posterior auris isalfo a fmall mufcle, very delicate and thin; but the anterior rifes in one fmall and narrow flip only, while this, the poflerior, rifes commonly in three narrow and diftinft flips, from about the place of the maflioid procefs J ; whence it is often named triceps auris. It goes direftly for- wards to be implanted into the concha. It is named retrahens auris from its office. But there are Hill other mufcles enumerated, which are not for moving the outward ear upon the head, but for moving or rather bending, the individual parts of the ear upon each other. Thofe fibres, which are mifnamed mufcles, are merely mufcular membranes, * Vide Palfin, who was his pupil. The celebrated Albinus could move his ears. -f- We feldom find an anterior auris, or any thing different from the anterior fibres of the attollens. f Fibras earns tranfverfee, a nobis deferiptse Valsalva. which

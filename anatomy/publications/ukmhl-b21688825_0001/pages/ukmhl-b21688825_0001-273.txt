LOWER JAW, THROAT, AKD TONGUE. 2 29 LVIII. The over the upper conftridtor like a fecond layer ; its uppermoft peak or pointed part touches the occipital bone, and its lower point is hidden by the next rnufcle. LVI. The constrictor inferior arifes partly from the thyroid, and partly from the cricoid cartilage ; and it again goes alio obliquely, fo as to overlap or cove^ the lower part of the conftritlor medius. This, like the other two conftrictors, meets its fellow in a tendi- nous middle line ; and fo the morfel admitted into the pharynx by the dilatation of its arches, is puflied down into the cefophagus by the forces of thefe conftriclorcs pharyngis, addled by its ftyloid mufcles. LVII. The oesophagus is merely the continuation of the fame tube. It lies flat upon the back-bone, and it is covered in its whole length by a nmfcular coat, which is formed, not like this of the pharynx, of cir- cular fibres, but of fibres running according to its length chiefly. And this rnufcle furrounding the mem- braneous tube of the oefophagus like a Iheath, is named VAGINALIS GUL^E, MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE, The mufcles of the tongue are large bundles of flefli which come from the os hyoides, the chin, and the ftyloid procefs. Their thicknefs conftitutes the chief bulk of the tongue. Their actions perform all its motions. The mufcles, which I am now to defcribe, form the whole flefh of the tongue, excepting merely the thin membranes which cover the tongue, and give it form, and conduct its nerves to the papillae or feel- ing points, Q 3

200 MUSCLES OF THE. tendons are crowded into this one point; the zygo-- matic, levator, depreffor, and orbicularis oris mufcles meeting and croffing each other at this place. XII. The depressor labii inferioris is a fmall mufcle, the difcovery of which Cowper claims for him- felf. It is a fmall mufcle, lying on each fide of the chin, which, with its fellow, refembles very much the levators of the upper lip. The depreffor labii infe- rioris arifes on each fide of the chin, from the lower jaw-bone, under the line of the triangular mufcle. It goes obliquely upwards and inwards, till it meets its fellow in the middle of the lip ; and where the muf- cles of the oppofite fide meet, there is a little filtrum or furrow on the lower lip, as on the upper one. It mixes its fibres with the orbicularis, and its ufe is to pull the lip downwards. Each mufcle is of a fquare form, and thence has been often named quadratus genjE, the fquare mufcle of the chin. XIII. The orbicularis oris, or mufcle round the mouth,isoftennamed constrictor oris, sphincter., or osculator. It is very regular; it is an inch in breadth, and conflitutes the thicknefs of the lips; it lies in the red part of the lips, and is of a circular form, furrounding the mouth after the fame manner that the orbicularis oculi encircles the eye. We, fee a degree of croffing in the fibres at the angles of the mouth, whence it has been confidered by many, not as a circular mufcle, but as one confifling of two femi- C f cular mufcles, the semi-orbicularis superior, and semi-orbicularis inferior. Its fixed points are the two angles of the mouth ; at that fwelling which is formed by the union of the zygomatic, triangular, and other

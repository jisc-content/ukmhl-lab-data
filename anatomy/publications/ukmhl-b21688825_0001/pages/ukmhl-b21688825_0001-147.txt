OF THE FACE AND JAWS. I03 H 4 ed flightly together in the chin. This joining, or fym- phyfis, as it is called, is eafily hurt, fo that in preterna- tural labours it is, according to the common method of pulling by the chin, always in danger, and often bro- ken. During childhood the procefles are blunt, and fhort, do not turn upwards with a bold and acute angle, but go off obliquely from the body of the bone. The teeth are not rooted, but flicking fuperficially in the alveolar procefs; and another let lies under them, ready to pufh them from the jaws. Secondly, That in youth, the alveolar procefs is ex- tending, the teeth are increafmg in number. The coronoid and articulating proceffcs are growing acute and large, and are fet off at right angles frc m the bone. The teeth are now firmly rooted ; for the fecond fet has come up from the fubflance of the jaw. Thirdly, In manhood, the alveolar procefs is flill more elongated. The dentes fapientise are added to the number of the teeth ; but often, by this, the jaw * is too full, and this laft tooth coming up from the backmofl part of the alveolar procefs in either jaw, it fometimes happens, that the jaw cannot eafily clofe; the new tooth gives pain; it either corrupts, or it needs to be drawn. Fourthly, In old age, the jaw once more falls flat; it fhrinks according to the judgment by the eye, to half its fize ; the fockets are abforbed, and conveyed away ; and in old age the coronoid procefs rifes at a more acute angle from the fkull, and by the falling down of the alveolar procefs, the coronoid procefs feems in- creased in length.

OF THE TRUNK. 122 num, but is loofely conne&ed only with the mufcles of the abdomen, whence it is named the loofe or floating rib. The ribs are, in general, of a flattened form, their flat Tides being turned fmooth towards the lungs. But this flatnefs of the rib is not regular; it is contorted, as if the foft rib had been feized by either end, and twill- ed betwixt the hands: the meaning of which is, to ac- commodate the flatnefs of the rib to the form which the thorax aflumes in all its degrees of elevation ; for when the rib rifes, and during its riling through all the degrees of elevation, it Hill keeps its flat fide towards the lungs. Though of a' flattened form, the rib is a little rounded at its upper edge; is Iharp and cutting at Its lower edge; and its lower edge feems double, for there is a groove made there by the intercollal artery and nerve. They are named intercollal, from lying betwixt the ribs. The artery being rather within the rib, is defended in fome degree by its groove; the lip of which forms the lower edge of the rib: but llill this ar- tery is not without reach of the knife, in fome furgica! operations. We are careful, therefore, to mark, that it runs on the lower edge of the rib, and is of the fize of a crow-quill; and that, if it be wounded, it will bleed largely, from its nearnefs to the greatell artery of the body; that it is eafily Ihunned, by keeping the knife nearer to the rib below. On each rib we find the following parts: i. The head, or round knob by which it is joined to the fpine. The head of each rib has indeed but a fmall articulat- ing furface; but that fmooth furface is double, or looks two ways. For the head of the rib is not im- planted into the fide of one vertebra; it is rather im- planted

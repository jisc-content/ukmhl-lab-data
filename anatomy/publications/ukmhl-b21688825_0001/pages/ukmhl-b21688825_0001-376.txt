332 MUSCLES OF THE PARTS OF of each fide goes out flat and thin upon the crus penis of its own fide, a little higher than the infertion of the eredtor penis; and thus it embraces the bulb itfelf with its two crura. We know and feel its convulfive % involuntary action in throwing out the feed; and we are confcious that we ufe it as a voluntary mufcle in emptying the urethra of the laft drops of urine. CLIII. The sphincter ani mufcle is a broad circu- lar band of fibres which furrounds the anus. It arifes from the point of the os coccygis behind. It fends a neat fmall flip forwards, by which it is attached to the back part of the accelerator mufcle. It is of a regular oval form, and is two inches broad, and is for a very obvious reafon ftronger in man than in animals. Some choofe to enumerate two fphindter mufcles, of which tUs is the external or cutaneous; and what they de- fcribe as the internal one, is merely the circular fibres, or mufcular coat of the inteftine, ftrengthened a little towards the anus, but not a diftindt mufcle. Its effedt is to fliut the anus. CLIV. The levator ani mufcle is defcribed as a pair of mufcles, one from each fide : but it is properly one broad and thin mufcle, which arifes from the inter- nal furface of all the fore part of the pelvis; and from its breadth it has been named musculus ani latus. It continues its origin from the internal furface of the pubis, all the way round to the facrum. It grows gra- dually fmaller as it goes downwards to furround the anus. So it is inferted into the circle of the anus, into the point of the os coccygis, and is mixed with the fphindter ani mufcle. The whole pelvis is lined with it like a funnel or inverted cone; the wider part re- prefenting

MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. bend obliquely round to be implanted into the leffer trochanter. The ploas magnus and iliacus internus are two very powerful mufcles. Their chief ufe is to bend the thigh, and more peculiarly of the lumbar one to fupport the body. The great blood-veflfels come down along with thefe two mufcles : The mufcles and veflels are both furrounded with loofe cellular fubftance. Matter often forming behind the abdomen, round the pfoas mufcle, is named the pfoas abfcefs; and penetrating under Paupartâ€™s ligament, burfts in the thigh at laft, and is commonly fatal. CLX, The pectineus, or pectinalis, is fo named from its arifing at the peften or pubis; is a broad flat fquare mufcle j lies along fide of the laft defcribed mufcles; and is inferted with their common tendon. It arifes flat and flefliy from that line of the pubis which forms the brim of the pelvis, and is implanted into the linea afpera by a tendon flat and long, pretty nearly of the fame extent and fhape with its origin. This mufcle lies immediately under the Ikin and fafcia lata; and by its bending round under the thigh- bone it has three actions: to clofe the knees together; to pull the thigh forward 5 to perform rotation, turn- ing out the toe ; and in certain pofitions of the limb it will pull the thigh back, affifting the extenfor mufcles. CLXI. The triceps femoris is a broad flat mufcle, with three heads, arifing from the pubis, and inferted into the whole length of the linea afpera down to the condyle, and ferving for prefling the knees together or bringing the thigh forwards* The

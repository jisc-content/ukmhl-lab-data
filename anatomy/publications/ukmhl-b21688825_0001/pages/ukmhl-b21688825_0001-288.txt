244 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. â™¦ performs exactly the fame motion with the middle part of the deltoides, lies in the fame diredtion with it, and aflifts it. LXXIV. Infra spinatus, is like the former, in all refpedfs, of the fame ufe, and aflifts it. . This alfo is of a triangular fhape, and is fully one half larger than the fupra fpinatus; and as the fupra fpinatus arifes from all the triangular cavity above the fpine, this arifes from all the triangular cavity below it. It arifes flelhy from all the back of the fcapula be- low the fpine itfelf, and from all the bafe of the fca- pula below the beginning of the fpine, and alfo from the lower margin of the fcapula. It is very thick and ftrong, filling up the triangular cavity entirely; and it is clofed in like the former by a ftrong tendinous ex- panfion; it begins to grow)( tendinous about its middle, but it continues alfo flelhy till it pafles over the focket of the fhoulder-joint. It alfo is connedted with the capfular ligament; is inferted into the fame tuberofity with the former; and has exactly the fame ufes, viz. preventing the capfule from being catched in the joint, and raifing the arm upwards, and inclining it a little outwards by a flight degree of rotation. And I do believe that one great ufe of thefe two mufcles is, when the arm is much extended backwards, to pre- vent the head of the humerus from ftarting out of its fuperficial focket. LXXV. The teres minor is a third mufcle which co-operates with thefe. This and another are named teres from their appearance, not from their fhape; for they feem round when fuperficially diffedted, becaufe then

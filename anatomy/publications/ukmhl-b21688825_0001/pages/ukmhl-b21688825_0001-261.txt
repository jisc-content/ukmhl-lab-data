LOWER JAW, THROAT, AND TONGUE. 21 f the Form at its opening, to regulate the voice. The thy* rcid cartilage is the great one, the chief defence be- fore, and which has edges flanting far backwards, to defend the opening of the larynx. The cricoid cartilage, which forms the upper ring of the trachea, fupports the arytenoid cartilages, and by its deepnefs behind, raifes them fo that the opening of the glottis is behind the middle of the great thyroid cartilage, and in the deepell part of it, well defended by its pro- jecting wings. The arytenoid cartilages form the rima glottidis, the chink by which we breathe (which, as it is narrower or wider, modulates and tunes the voice), the opening which is fo exquifitely moved by its mufcles in fmging; widening or contracting in molt delicate degrees; and which is fo fpafmodically fhut by the fame mufcles when it is touched by a drop of water, or by a crumb of bread : but the valve of the glottis, the epiglottis Handing over it, flaps down like the key of a wind inftrument, fo that the rarenefs of fuch accidents is wonderful, when we con- fider that the lead attempt to draw the breath, while we are fvvallowing, will produce the accident. The mufcles which move the tongue and throat mull be far too complicated to be explained at all, without fome previous fjlowledge of thefe parts; and Hill, I fear, not eafily to be explained with every help of re- gularity and order. MUSCLES OF THE THROAT. By this arrangement, I mean to include under one ciafs all thofe mufcles which move the os-hyoides, or the larynx; and through thefe, as centrical points,

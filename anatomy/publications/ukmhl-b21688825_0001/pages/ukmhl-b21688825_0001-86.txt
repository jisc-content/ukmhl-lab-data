OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL. 42 the thought of, for preventing the like miftake. It may be ufeful to remember that the future has its ferrse or indentations ; is firmly covered by the pericranium; is clofe, and does not bleed : but that a fiffure, or fraoÂ« ture of the Ikull, runs in one direft line ; is larger and broader at the place of the injury ; grows fmaller, as you recede from that, till it vanifiies by its lmallnefs; and that it always bleeds, Indeed the older furgeons, obferving this, poured ink upon the fufpected part, which, if the fkull was hurt, funk into the fiffure, and made it black and vifible ; but left the future un- touched. They alfo dire&ed to make the patient take a wire betwixt his teeth, which being ftruck, like the firing of an inftrument, he would feel the twang pro- duce a painful and peculiar fenfation in the fractured part of the head. But after all thefe obfervations, in place of any true and certain marks, we find a number of accidents which may lead us into a miftake. Sutures cannot be diflinguifhed by their ferrse or teeth, for the temporal futures want this common chara&er, and rather referable capillary fraftures of the Ikull * ; nor even by their places, for we know that there are often infulated bones (offa Wormiana) furrounded with peculiar joinings, which fo derange the courfe of the common futures, that the joinings may be miflaken for fraftures of the fkull, and the offa Wor- miana for broken parts. Sometimes the fquamous fu- ture is double, with a large arch of bone intercepted betwixt the true and the falfe future ; or the fagittal future, descending beyond its ufual extent, and quite to * Viz. Fractures as fmall as a hair, thence named capillary.

SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. l8l dius lies along the upper edge of the fore arm, next to the thumb, and being, like the ulna, of a prifinatic or triangular form, it has one of its angles or edges turned towards the ulna to receive the interofifeous ligament. 2. The upper head of the radius is fmaller; of a round, flattifh, and button-like fliape, and lies fo upon the lower end of the fhoulder-bpne, and upon the co* ronoid procefs of the ulna, that it is articulated with either bone ; for, i ft, The hollow of its head is di- rectly oppofed to the little head of the os humeri; and, 2dly, The fiat fide of its button-like head rubs and turns upon the fide of the coronoid procefs of the ulna, making a focket there, which is called the leffer fig- mold cavity of the ulna. 3. Immediately behind the round fiat head, is a narrownefs or ftraitening, called the neck of the ra- dius. Round this neck there is a collar or circular ligament (named the coronary ligament of the ra- dius), which keeps the bone fecurely in its place, turning in this ligamentous band like a fpindle in its bulh or focket: for the radius has two motions, one accompanying the ulna in its movements of flexion and extenfion; and,fecondly, its own peculiar rotation | in which it is not accompanied in return by the ulna, but the ulna continuing fleady, the radius moves, and turns the wrift, 4. Immediately under this neck, and juft below the' collar of the bone, there is a prominent bump, like a flat button, foldered upon the fide of the bonej which is the point into which the biceps flexor cubiti, or bending mufcle of the fore arm, is inferted, n 3 5.

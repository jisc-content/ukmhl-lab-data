DESCRIPTION OF THE $2 HOLES.—The fphenoid bone is fo placed in the very centre of the Ikull, that its holes tranfmit the principal nerves of the Ikull, and it bears the marks of the chief arteries. 1. The optic holes,are large, round holes, juft un- der each anterior clynoid procefs. We trace the optic nerves, by a large groove into each optic hole; and an artery goes along with them, named the ophthalmic artery, about the fize of a crow-quill, twilling round the optic nerve, and giving arteries to the eyelids, mufcles, and lachrymal gland, but moft efpecially to the ball and humours of the eye itfeif. This ocular • or ophthalmic artery comes off from the great carotid, while it lies by the fide of the cella turcica ; and it is a branch again of this ocular artery, which goes out upon the forehead, forming the fuperciliary notch, or hole. 2. The foramen lacerum is next in order, and is fo named, becaufe it is a wide flit. The foramen la- cerum is wide near the cella turcica, grows gradually narrower as it goes out towards the temple, till it ter- minates almoft in a flit. The upper line of the fora- men lacerum is formed by the anterior clynoid pro- cefs, extending outwards, lharp and flat: And this is what fome have chofen to diftinguilh by the name of transverse spinous process, or the little wing of Ingrafias, who had obferved it. The nerves of the Ikull are counted from- before backwards. There are nine nerves proper to the Ikull; the firft, or olfactory nerve, perforates the cribri- form bone; the 2d, or optic nerve, paffes through the optic hole; the 3d, the 4th, part of the 5th, and the

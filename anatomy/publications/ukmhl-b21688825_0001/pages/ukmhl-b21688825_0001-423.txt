MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES. ^79 The mufcles of the foot are the interossei, which, in die foot, are found fingle on the lower furface or foie, but double and two-headed upon the upper part the foot. The abductor flexor, and adductor, pollicis, which furround the great toe, fomething like thofe of the thumb ; and the abductor and flexor minimi dxgiti, furrounding the little toe; and there is a fmall flip of mufcle, the transversalis pedis, which goes acrofs the foie of the foot. CXCVII. The abductor pollicis arifes by very fhort tendinous fibres from the knob of the os calcis, and alfo from a ligament which flretches from this knob to the ftieath which belongs to the tibialis pofli- cus ; and it arifes alfo from the tendinous partition be- twixt it and the fliort flexor of the toes ; and although it forms a beginning tendon oppofite to the cuneiform bone, the tendon is not naked till it has reached the middle of the long metatarfal bone. It unites with the fliort flexor of the fame toe, and is inferted into the firfl: bone or phalanx of the toe at its root. Its ufe is to pull afide the toe, and at the fame time to bend it a little ; it alfo curves the foot itfelf; for a joint, or any loaded part, is much better fupported by mufcles than by ligaments; and this arch requires fupport more than almofl: any other part. CXCVIII. Flexor brevis pollicis. This mufcle is much fliorter than the laft:, and lies betwixt the ab- ductor and the adductor : it lies immediately upon the metatarfal bone. Its origin is by a pretty long tendon from the heel- bone, and from the os cuneiforme externum, by two feparate flips, from the heel-bone, being a full inch

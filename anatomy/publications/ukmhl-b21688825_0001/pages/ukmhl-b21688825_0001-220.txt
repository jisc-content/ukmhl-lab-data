bones of The the bone, there are two fafciae or tendinous webs which go off from, either edge of the humerus, and which continue to divide the fore from the back mufcles, giving thefe mufcles a broader origin ; they are named, from their office, intermufcular membranes; and this is the meaning of the two ridges which lead to the two condyles. 2. The two projections in which thefe edges end are named condyles. The condyles of the thigh-bone are the broad articulating furfaces by which that bone is joined with the tibia ; while the condyles of the fhoul- der-bone are merely two iharp projecting points for the origin of mufcles, which hand out from either fide of the joint, but which have no connection with the joint. The chief ufe of the condyles of the fhoulder-bone is to give a favourable origin, and longer fulcrum, for the, mufcles of the fore arm, which arile from thefe points. The outer tubercle being the fmailer one, gives origin to the extenfor mufcles, where lefs ilrength is required. But the inner tubercle is much longer, to give origin to the flexor mufcles with which we grafp ; which require a bolder and more prominent procefs to arife from; for greater power is needed to perform fuch ftrong aCtions as grafping, bending, pulling ; while the muf- cles which extend the fingers need no more power than juft to antagonife or oppofe the flexors; their only bu- finefs begin to unfold or open the hand when we are to renew the grafp. It is further curious to obferve, that the inner tu- bercle is alfo lower than the other, fo that the articu- lating furface of the elbow-joint is oblique, which makes the hand fail naturally towards the face and breafl,

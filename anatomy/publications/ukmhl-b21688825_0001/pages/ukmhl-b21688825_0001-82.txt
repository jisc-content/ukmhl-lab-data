3^ OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL. the thefe marks, that it became a rule, to cut freely, and quickly, through the outer table ; to expedt the change of found, and the flow of blood, as marks of having reached the cancelli ; and then to cut more deliberate- ly, and flowly, through the inner table of the ikull. But this ihows an indifcreet hurry, and unpardonable rafhnefs in operation. The patient, during this faw- ing of the ikull, is fuffering neither danger nor pain j and many additional reafons lead us to refufe, altoge- ther, this rule of practice. For the Ikull of a child confiils properly of one table only ; or tables are not yet diftinguiihed, nor the cancelli formed : In youth, the ikull has its proper arrangement of cancelli and tables ; but dill, with fuch irregularities, and excep- tions, as make a hurried operation unfafe : In old age, the Ikull declines towards its original condition; the cancelli are obliterated ; the tables approach each other, or are clofed and condenfed into one; the ikull be- comes irregularly thick, at fome points, and at others thin, or almoil tranfparent â€¢: fo that there can hardly be named any period of life, in which this operation may be performed quickly and fafely at once. But, befides this gradual progrefs of a bone, increafing in thicknefs and regularity as life advances, and grow- ing irregular and thinner in the decline of life, we find dangerous irregularities, even in younger ikulls. There are often at uncertain diftances, upon the internal fur- face of the ikull, hollows and defeats of the internal table, deep pits, or foveas, as they are called, produced perhaps by the impreflion of contorted veins. Thefe foveas increafe in fize and in number as we decline in life j they are more frequent on the inner furfaces of

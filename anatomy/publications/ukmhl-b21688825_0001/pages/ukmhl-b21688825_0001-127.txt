INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. 83 the whole of the 6th pairs of the nerves, pafs through this foramen lacerum, or wide hole, to go alfo into the eye. The optic nerve forms the proper organ of vifion. The fmaller nerves of the 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th pairs, go to animate its mufcles, with the trifling exception of fome fmall twigs, which, pafling through the orbit, mount upon the forehead, or go downwards into the nofe. 3. The foramen rotundum, is named from its round fliape. The foramen opticum is indeed round, but it has already got an appropriated name. Now to give the young anatomifl: a regular notion of this, and of the next hole, we muft enumerate the branches of the 5th pair. The fifth nerve of the brain is as broad as the little finger, and lies by the fide of the cella turcica, where it divides into three Iefler nerves, which are called branches of the 5th pair. The firfl: branch of the 5th pair is deftined for the eye; the fecond branch of the 5th pair for the upper jaw; the third branch of this 5th pair for the lower jaw % fo the firfl; branch of the 5th pair pafles through the foramen lacerum to the eye j the fecond branch of the 5th pair pafles through the foramen rotundum to the upper jaw; the third branch of this great nerve pafles through the foramen ovale to the lower jaw j and if we had any faith in the dottrines of nervous fympathy, we ihould fay, here is a wide fympathy provided among the nerves of the eye, the face, and the lower jaw. The foramen rotundum, then, is a hole exa&ly* round, pretty large, opening immediately under the inner end of the foramen lacerum, and tranfmitting the g i fecpftd

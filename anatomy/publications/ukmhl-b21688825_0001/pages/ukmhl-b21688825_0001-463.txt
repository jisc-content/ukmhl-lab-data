419 JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINk. Is very ftrong before; and at the middle fhort point of the atlas it feems a diftintft ligament, which is ftrong only at this point, and very lax and membranous behind *. 3. We find the atlas tied to the denta- tus by a more complete order of ligaments. Thefe are, ift, (as betwixt the atlas and dentatus), regular capfules or bags, fixing the condyles of one verte- bra to the condyles of the other. 2dly, A crofs liga- ment f, which, croffing the ring of the firft vertebra* makes a bridge, embraces the neck of the tooth- like procefs, and ties it down in its place. 3dly, A fmooth and cartilaginous furface all round the root of the tooth-like procefs, where this tooth of the denta- tus turns in the ring of the atlas, and is bound by the ligament; and this rolling of the atlas upon the axis of the dentatus is fo fair and proper a joint, that it alfo is all included in a capfular ligament. 4thly, The point of the tooth-like procefs having threaded the ring of the atlas, almoft touches the occipital hole; and there another ligament ties it by its point to the occipital hole j. All * This is part of what Window called ligakentum infundi- biliforme, a funnel-like ligamenT, joining the firft vertebra to the occiput. ■f Viz. LigamentOM transversale, or transversum ; and what are called the appendices of the transverse liga- ment, are merely its edges, extending upwards and downwards, to be fixed into the dentatus, and into the occipital hole, fo as to in- clofe the tooth-like procefs of the dentatus in a capfule. £ There are two flat ligaments which come from about the neck cr root of the tooth-like procefs, and which go obliquely upwards, to be fixed into the groove juft behind the lip of the occipital hole j EE 2 but

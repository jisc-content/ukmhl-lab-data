Often a fmall flip runs up from the middle of the upper lip to the tip of the nofe; it is the nasalis labii superioris of Albinus; it lies exactly in the furrow of the filtrum, and is occafion- ally a levator of the upper lip, or a depreffor of the tip of the nofe. Thefe -mufcles of the nofe and lips are not ufeful merely in exprefling the paflions; that is but a fe- condary and accidental ufe, while their great office is to perform thofe continual movements which breath- ing, fpeaking, chewing, fwallowing, require.

The levator labii fuperioris, and the depreffor labii inferioris, feparate the lips, and open the mouth. The levator anguli oris, along with the zygomatic mufcles, raifes the cheek, and dilates the corners of the mouth. The buccinator pulls the cor- ner of the mouth direftly backwards, opening the mouth. The angularis oris alfo dilates the mouth, pulls the angles of the mouth downwards and back- wards, and forms it into a circle, if the others aft at the fame time; but the orbicularis oris is the largeft and ftrongeft (formed, as it were, by the fibres of all thefe taking a new direftion, and turning round the lips), fhuts the mouth, and antagonizes them all: and from an opening as wide as the mouth can require, fhuts the mouth at pleafure, fo clofely as to retain the very breath againft all the force of the lungs.

/ MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 265 ed in the back parts of the fingers; and their final connection is not with the bending tendons of the fublimis and profundus, but with tendons of the ex- tenfor digitorum, and with the tendons of the exter- nal interoflei mufcles, and with which they are united by tendinous threads. Hence their ufe is very evident: they bend the firft joint, and extend the fecond; they perform alter- nately either office: when the extenfors aft, they af- fift them by extending the fecond phalanx or joint: when the flexors aft, and keep the firft and fecond joint bended, the extending effeft of thefe fmaller mufcles is prevented, and all their contraction mult be direfted fo as to affeft the firft joint only, which they then bend. They are chiefly ufeful in performing the quick fhort motions, and fo they are named by Cowper the mufculi fidicinales, as chiefly ufeful in playing upon mufical inftruments. XC. The flexor longus pollicis is placed by the fide of the fublimis or perforatus, and lies under the extenfor, or rather extenfores carpi. It runs along the inner fide of the radius, whence chiefly it arifes. Its origin is from all the internal face of the radius downwards; from the place where the biceps is in- ferted, and from the interofleous ligament, all the length down to the origin of the pronator quadratus, nor does it even flop here; for the tendon continues to receive flefhy flips all the way down to the entry, under the ligament of the wrifl. It has often alfo another head which arifes from the condyle of the humerus and the fore-part of the ulna j which head is

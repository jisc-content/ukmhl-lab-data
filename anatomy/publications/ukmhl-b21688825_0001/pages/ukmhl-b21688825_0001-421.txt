MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES. 277 the buckle lies, upon the rifing of the foot, having its origin from the heel-bone, and running obliquely in- wards. Its origin is from the outer fide and fore part of the heel-bone, and alfo from part of the annular ligament. It is fmaller where it arifes by a ftiort tendon from the heel-bone, but it gradually increafes in fize: it divides early into four heads, which are mufcular, and very diftindt; the two inner of which are larger, the two outer more llender : each head has already formed an oblique tendon under its flefli, which begins to appear naked about half way down the metatarfal bones, 'fhefe tendons crofs thofe of the long extenfor, and pafs under them nearly about the end of the metatar- fal bones. Then one is implanted into the firft bone of the great toe, on the infide of the long tendon under which it had turned. The fecond, third, and fourth tendon are inferted Into their refpedtive next toes, and the little toe is left without one. The three laft of thefe tendons form a fort of fit; the two fides of which pafs along the fides of the toes, furrounding the long tendon, fomething like a perforatus; fo that the three laft tendons are inferted along with the long tendons into the laft bone of the toes, The obliquity of this ftiort mufcle countera&s the obliquity of the long ; and it ferves to extend and to fpread the toes, and to pull them away from the great toe. CXC.VI. The extensor pollicis proprius is a very fender mufcle, running from the top of the leg to the fecond joint of the great toe. It arifes from the fibula

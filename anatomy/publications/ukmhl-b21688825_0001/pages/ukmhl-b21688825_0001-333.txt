OR, OF THE RIBS. 289 ' CXVI. The intercostales are two rows of muf- cles which lie betwixt the ribs: one row is external, the other internal. The external intercostals run from the fpine towards the fternum, having their fibres directed from behind forwards, and flopping at the cartilages of the ribs. The internal, again, begin from the fternum, and go towards the fpine; they have their fibres direfted backwards, and they flop at the angle of the ribs ; the reafon for which might be given, were it worth our while to flop for an explana- tion. Thefe two rows were thought to antagonize each other; the one to pull the ribs downwards, the other to raife them. But I fhall not flop to explain this, nor to refute it; it is fufficient to declare their true ufe, which is (both external and internal) to raife the ribs and aflift infpiration #. The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, have a freer motion ; and it appears to me that this is the true ufe of the levatores longiores ; and for the fame rea- fon we find, that from the fixth rib and downwards there are certain flips of the internal intercoftals, which pafs over one rib and go to the fecond below ; and as the levatores longiores were called fupra-coftales, thefe have been named infra-costales, and costarum depressores proprii. They were difcovered by Verhein, and bear his name: they were explained as depreffors of the ribs by Haller; but they are little different from the intercoftals in form, and not at all * I remember, many years ago, to have heard Dr. Monro explain the office of the intercoftal mufcles by a diagram, deducing from that argument, the more powerful effeft of allinufcleshavingoblique fibres, VOL.

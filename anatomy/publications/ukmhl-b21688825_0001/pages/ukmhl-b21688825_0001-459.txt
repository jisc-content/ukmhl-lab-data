LIGAMENTS, BURSiE, &C. 4*5 ligament, which forms the purfe of the joint, binds the bones together, contains the fynovia, and prevents the furrounding parts from being catched in the joint: There are letter ligaments on the outfide of this, going along the Tides of the joint, and palling from point to point: There are great tendons moving over the joint and burtte, or mucous bags, which accompany thefe tendons, and prevent the violence which their conti- nual rubbing might do to the bones. All thefe parts are of one conftitution and nature ; we cannot fay that they are infenfible, for their feeling is only deferred ; it is flow, but not the lefs fevere. The eye feels the inftant that a mote falls upon it; but the Ikin does not feel a blitter till it has been fome hours applied; the ligaments and joints feel ttill lefs in the inftant that any injury is done : but as the inflammation of the blitter excites the feeling, and deftroys the fabric of the Ikin, producing pain and derangement of its parts, the inflammation of joints, and of all the parts belong- ing to them, breaks up the organization of the part, evolves the feeling, and then in them alfo comes difeafe and violent pain. They are flow in entering into ac- tion ; but, once excited, they continue to act with a perfeverance quite unknown in any other part of the fyftem. Their mode of action, whatever it may be at the time, is not eafily changed: if at reft, they are not eafily moved to action, and their excefiive action once begun is not eafily allayed. The difeafes are in- finite to which thefe parts are fubject. They are fub- ject to dropfical effufions; they are fubject to ge- latinous concretions; they are fubject to flight inflammation, to fuppuration, to erofions of their car- tilages.

MUSCK'ES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. ing inferted into the root of the great trochanter. It pulls the thigh forwards, but is more peculiarly a ro- tator of the thigh. This mufcle is of the fecond lay- er ; and the fucceffion of all the mufcles is this: the upper layer confifts of the pfoas and iliacus, where they come out from the abdomen; of the pedtinalis; and of the long head of the triceps : the fecond layer confifts of the lhort head of the triceps: and the third layej confifts of the obturator externus at the upper part, and of the triceps magnus, or third head of the triceps, all down to the condyle. Glutei.—-There are three glutasi mufcles, each under the ether, and each fmaller than the mufcle which covers it. The first, arifing from the back part of the ilium, the back of the facrum, and the fa- cro-fciatic ligament, forms the whole hip, and defeends fo low as to be inferted into one third of the length of the linea afpera, and into the root of the great tro« chanter. The second arifes from all that portion of the ilium which is before this one, and from the back of the bone, and goes down to be inferted into the very top of the great trochanter. The third arifes from the back of the bone below the laft, down to the acetabulum and facro-fciatic finus; and it is inferted into the root betwixt the apex of the great trochanter and the neck of the bone. CLXIII. The GLUTiEus maximus arifes from the back of the ilium one half its length ; from the join- ing of the ilium and facrum; from all the fpines and irregularities of the facrum; and from the facro-fcia- tic ligament. Its thick fleihy fafciculae come in a wind- ing

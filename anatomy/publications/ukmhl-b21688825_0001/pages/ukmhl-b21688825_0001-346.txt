302 MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. the head to one fide; and the cervicalis defcendens bends the neck to one fide ; both the one and the other being independent mufcles, and having no further con- nection with each other than what arifes from the con- fufion of the parts. Thefe two mufcles bring us to mention that intri- cate fet of mufcles which fills up all the hollows and interftices among the fpines and irregular procefles of the vertebrae, which might be fairly reckoned as one mufcle, fmee they are one in place and in office ; but which the anatomifl may feparate into an infinite num- ber, with various and perplexing names ; an opportu- nity which anatomifls have been careful not to lofe. The furface of the back, from the bulge of the ribs on one fide to the bulge of the ribs on the oppofite fide of the thorax, is one confufed furface ; confifling of innumerable hollows, procefles, and points of bone; and it is tied from point to point with innumerable fmall mufcles, or unequal bundles of mixed tendon and flefh. There are many points; as the fpinous, tranf- verfe, and oblique procefles of the vertebras, and the bulging heads and angles of the ribs ; and each pro- cefs, or at leafl: each fet of procefles, has its diflindt fets of mufcles and tendons. 1. There is one long continuity of mufcular and tendinous fibres going from fpine to fpine, along the whole length of the back and neck. This is divided into the spinalis CERVicisand the spinalis dorsi. 2. There is a fimilar continuation of fibres, with lefs tendon and more flefh, belonging one half to the fpine and the other half to the tranfverfe procefles, where it is named semi-spinalis dorsi. 5 3.

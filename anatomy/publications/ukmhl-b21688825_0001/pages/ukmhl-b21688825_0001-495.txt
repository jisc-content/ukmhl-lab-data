It is only in the greatefi: joints that we find the additional fecurity of internal ligaments; and the â– only joints where they are perfect are the joints of the hip and of the knee .; the former having its round, or rather triangular, ligament, which fecures the great ball of the thigh-bone, and fixes it in its place; the latter having its crucial ligaments, v/hich, coming both from one point nearly, and going the one over the face of the tibia, and the other down the back of that bone, ferve the double purpofe of binding the bones firmly together, and of checking the larger and dangerous motions of the joint; the fore ligament pre- venting it going too far forwards, and the back liga- ment preventing it bending too much. 5. A moving cartilage, for facilitating motion and leffening fridion, is not common, but is peculiar to thcfe joints whofe motions are very frequent, or which move under a greater weight; fuch are the in- ner head of the clavicle, the articulation of the jaw, and the joints of the wri.fi and of the knee ; and it is in the knee that the movable cartilages have their molt perfed forms and life, are large and fiat, femilu- nar, to ccrrefpond with the forms on the head of the tibia; thicker at their outer edges, to deepen the fock- et; and though moveable, yet fo tied with ligaments gs never to go out from their right place. q q 2 And, G- ' ' *

BONES OF THE 186 7. The 4. The os pisiforme is a fmall neat and round bone,named fometimes orbicular,or round bone, but oftener pifiform, from its refemblance to a pea. It is placed upon the cuneiform bone, and ftands off from the reft into the palm of the hand, fo as to be the moft prominent of all the corner bones ; of courfe it forms one of the corner points or pillars of that arch, under which the tendons pafs. The pifiform bone is a little out of its ranks ; is very moveable; and projects fo into the palm, as to be felt outwardly, juft at the end of the ftyloid procefs of the ulna; it can be eaftly moved and rolled about; and is the point into which is implanted one of the ftrong mufcles for bending the wrift. 2. ROW SUPPORTING THE METACARPAL BONES, 5. Thefecond row begins with the trapezium ; a pretty large bone, which, from its name, we fhculd expedt to find of a regular fquared form ; while it has, in fadt, the moft irregular form of all, efpecially when detached from the other bones. The chief parts to be remarked in the bone, are the great focket for the thumb ; and as the thumb ftands off from one fide of the hand, this focket is rather on one fide. There is alfo a little procefs which makes one of the corner points. 6. The trapezoides is next to the trapezium; is fomewhat like the trapezium; from which it has its name. It alfo refembles the cuneiform bone of the firft row in its fhape and fize, and in its being wedged in betwixt the two adjoining bones.

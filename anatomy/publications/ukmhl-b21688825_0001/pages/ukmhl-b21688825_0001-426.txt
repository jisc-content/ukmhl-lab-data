382 MUSCLES MOVING THE TOES* CCIII. The interossei interni are three final! mufcles feated in the planta pedis, as the interoiTei manus are in the palm of the hand. Their flender tendons pafs through the openings of the aponeurofis plantaris; and, going on the infide of the toes, are* like the lumbricales, inferted along with the extenfor tendons. Thefe pull the toes towards the great tee, bend the firfl joint, and extend the fecond and third. CCIV. The interossei externi are, like thecor- refponding mufcles of the hand, four in number, and double headed, and have been named bicipites. They rife from the metatarfal bones on each fide of them : each has fome little variety in its origin or courfe ; but it is far from being worth our while to deferibe each individually, as many do : it is fufficient to obferve their origin, and that their tendons all meet the ten- dons of the long and ffiort extenfors of the lumbri- cales, and of the interossei interni, upon the back of the toes ; fo that the whole forms a web, aponeurofis, or {heath, which covers the upper part of the toe, and adheres to its point. The office of thefe mufcles is to extend the toes. Plantar aponeurosis.â€”The palm and the foie are much expofed, and are efpecially defended by a thick tendinous aponeurofis. In the palm there is the more reafon to fufpect expanfion to proceed from the ten- don of the mufcle, becaufe the tendon of the palmaris is inferted into it: yet that is not probable ; for the tendon is very {lender, and quite unfit for the gene- ration of fo broad a fheet of aponeurofis. In the foot fuch an origin is {bill lefs lefs probable : for the plantaris ^ 13 tendon

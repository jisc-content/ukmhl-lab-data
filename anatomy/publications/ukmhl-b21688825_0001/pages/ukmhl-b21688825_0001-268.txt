MUSCLES OF The 224 the cricoid cartilage, but from the back furface of the wing of the thyroid; from t’ne hollow of its wing, or where it covers the cricoidis implanted into the fore part of the arytenoid cartilage, and by pulling the car- , ^1 age forward and fid'awife, directly flackens the liga- ments and widens thfj glottis. Thefe are all the mufcles which belong to the larynx j and in our arrangement the mufcles of the palate and pharynx come next in order. When a morfel is to be thrown down into the oefo- phagus, e;r tube which leads to the ftomach, the velum palatP, or curtain of the palate, is drawn upwards; the opening of the throat is dilated ; the morfel is re- ceived ; then the curtain of the palate falls down again. Tiie arch of the throat is contracted, the bag of the pharynx is comprelfed by its own mufcles; and the food is forced downwards into the flomach. XLVIII. The azygos uvulj:.—1The velum pen- dulum palati, is that pendulous curtain which we fee hanging in the back part of the mouth, in a line with the fide circles of the throat; and the uvula is a fmall pap, or point of flefh, in the centre of that cur- tain. The azygos uvulze, or fingle mufcle of the uvula, is a fmall flip of flraight fibres, which goes di- re&ly down to the uvula in the centre of the curtain* It arifes from the peak, or backmofl fharp point of the palate bones, and pulls the uvula, or pap of the throat, direCtly upwards, removing it out of the way of the morfel which is to pafs. XLIX. Levator palati mollis arifes from the point of the os petrofum, and from the eustachian tube.

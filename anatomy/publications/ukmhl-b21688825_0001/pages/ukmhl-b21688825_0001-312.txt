2.68 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. flefhy cufhion; but the extenfors requiring lefs power, arife from the fhorter procefs of the outer condyle, are on the convex fide of the arm, and are thin, hav- ing few fibres: for though there is a large mafs of flefli on the inner fide of the arm, forming two big flexors, there is only a thin layer on the outer fide of the arm, forming one flat and weak extenfor. XCII. Supinator radii longus. This mufcle forms the very edge of the fore-arm: It arifes by many fhort tendinous fibres from the ridge of the hu- merus, above the external condyle, which origin is fully two inches in length above the condyle. It alfo arifes from the inter-mufcular membrane; and, as it Hands on the very edge of the fore-arm, it runs be- twixt the flexor and extenfor radialis. It becomes thicker as it paflfes the elbow-joint, and there gives a very peculiar form to the arm : It then becomes fmal- ler, and forms a flat tendon, which is quite naked of flefh from the middle of the radius, or a little below, down to the wrift. This tendon becomes gradually fmaller till it reaches the wrifl;, where, expanding a little, it is inferted into the radius, juft in the tuber of its lower head. Its ufe is perhaps chiefly as a fupinator, but it is placed juft upon the edge of the arm : it Hands as a fort of intermedium betwixt the two fets of mufcles; it is fixed indeed rather upon the internal furface of the radius; but yet when the fupination is complete, when the hand is rolled very much outward, it will become a pronator. It is all at once fupinator and pronator, and, for a molt evident reafon, a flexor alfo of the fore-arm j fince its

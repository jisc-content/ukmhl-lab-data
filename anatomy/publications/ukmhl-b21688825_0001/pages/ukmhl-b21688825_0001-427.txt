MU3CLES MOVING THE TOES. 383 tendon does not terminate in the plantar aponeurofis, but is inferted into the heel-bone. The plantar aponeurofis arifes moft diflin&iy from that part of the tuber of the heel-bone upon which we ftand: it is divided into three {heaths. Sabbatier makes a middle, external, and internal portion of the fame aponeurofis. Albinus alfo defcribes it as three diftinct aponeurofes ; one for the middle of the foot; one for the abductor of the great toe ; and one theapo- neurofis of the abdu&or of the little toe ; all conne&ed together only by their edges. Cowper confiders it as a general expanfion from the plantaris; and it is from, this prejudice that the mufcle has its name. But its true origin is from that part of the knob of the heel-bone on which we Hand. The middle, and more pointed tendon, arifes from the very point of the knob ; the inner fafcia arifes from the infide of this ; and the outer one from the outfide. And though thus divided into three heads, yet the whole origin is from the heel-bone, and is fmall and pointed. From this point the aponeurofis goes forward, expanding till it is as broad as the roots of the toes ; fo that the whole has the fhape of a fandal $ and as it expands, its fibres are more fcattered, fo as to have a radiated appearance. Accordingly, the part neared the heel is thicker, while the broader part is thinner. It goes forward like the foie of a fhoe, till, having approached the heads of the metatarfal bones, it is divided into five heads, correfponding with the five knobs: and each of thefe heads again fubdivides it- fe'lf into two bands; which, paffing on each fide of the heads of the metatarfal bones, is fixed into the fides*

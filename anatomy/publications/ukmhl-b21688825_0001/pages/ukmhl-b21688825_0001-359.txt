3,5 AND.OF THE DIAPHRAGM. nous; from the tranfverfe precedes of the four lower lumbar vertebras; from the whole fpine of the os ilium ; and from a part of the femoral ligament. Upon the whole, its origin is like that of the inner oblique mufcle ; its fibres go aerofs the abdomen, and its tendon is in- ferted into the whole length of the linea alba. The fucceflion in winch thefe three mufcles arife from the cheft is this: The external oblique mufcle lies broad upon the outftde of the chefl, and fo its tongues mix with the tongues of the ferratus anticus major. The internal oblique mufcle again rifes lower down the thorax, from its edge, from the cartilages of the ribs, The tranfverfe mufcle arifes within the tho- rax, from the internal furface of tire ribs, oppofite to where the tongues of the external oblique lie ; and the diaphragm arifing from the fame ribs, mixes its indigk tations with the tranfverfalis ; fo that Cafpar Bartho- lin obferving this indigitation to be very curious in 4he larger animals, believed the diaphragm and tranfverfe mufcles to be but one great trigaftric or three bellied mufcle furrounding all the abdomen. CXLVI. The recti mufcles cover the abdomen on its fore part, in a line from the pubis to the fternum; ' and they belong fo equally to the fternum and to the pubis, that it is indifferent which we call their origin, and which their infertion. The origin (as I fhould call it) of each rectus mufcle is in the fternum; is broad and flelhy ; lies upon the out-fide of the fternum, co- vering part of the fternum, and all the xiphoid carti- lage, and touching and mixing its fibres with the great pedtoral mufcle. It is about four inches broad all down the abdomen, and' terminates at the fide of the fymphyfis

THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT. 165 in the fubftance of the tendons ; perhaps, like the pa- tella, they remove the adting force from the centre of motion ; and fo, by adting like pulleys, increafe the power; perhaps alfo by lying at the fides of the joint in the tendons of theThorter mufcles of the toes, they make a fafe gutter for the long tendons to pafs in. They are not reftridted to the balls of the great toe and thumb, but fometimes are alfo found under the other toes and fingers, and fometimes behind the con- dyles of the knee; or in the peronaei tendons, which run under the foie of the foot. In Ihort, they are fo far from being regular bones, that they are found only in adults, and are fo often found in irregular places, that they ahnoft feem to be produced by chance, or by the effedt of fridtion. Metatarsus.â€”The metatarfus, fo named from its being placed upon the tarfus, confifts of five bones, which differ fo little from the firft bones of the fingers, that they need not be minutely demonftrated. It is fufficient to mark, that they are five in number, hav- ing a general refemblance to the joints of the finger ; that they are rather flattened, efpecially on their lower Tides, where the tendons of the toes lie; that they are very large at their ends next the tarfus, where they have broad flat heads, that they may be implanted with great fecurity j that they grow frnal- ler towards the toes, where again they terminate, in. neat fmall round heads, which receive the firft bones of the toes, and permit of a very free and eafy mo- tion, and a greater degree of rotation than our drefs allows us to avail ourfelves of; the toes being cramp- ed together, in a degree that fixes them all in their M 3 places.

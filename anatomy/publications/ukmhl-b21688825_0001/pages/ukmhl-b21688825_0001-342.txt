298 MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. The common tendon and mufcle (for there is for fome way but one mufcle) begins thus: It may be faid to have two kinds of adhefion; for, firft, exter- nally it appears a broad, flat, and Aiming tendon, which arifes tendinous from all the fpines of the lum- bar vertebras, from the fpines of the facrum, and from the back part of the os ilium. But the inner furface of this broad tendon is ftrongly flefhy ; for it arifes fleihy from the back part of the ilium, from the deep hollow betwixt the ilium and facrum, from the fides of the long fpines of the lumbar vetebrae, and from their articulating procefles and the roots of their tranf- verfe procefles. In fhort, its origin is all tendinous without, and all flefhy within ; and its flefli arifes from all that irregular furface which is on either fide of the fpine, betwixt the os ilium and the vertebrae of file loins: and thus it continues one ftrong tendinous and flefhy mufcle, filling up all the hollow of the loins. There is an appearance of feparation, fomething like a fplit in the tendon, v/hich fhows in the loins what part of the tendon belongs to each mufcle; but it is only in the back that they are fairly divided. Juft oppoftte to the loweft rib, the longiflimus dorfi and facro lumbalis break of from the common ten- don ; and the longiflimus goes to be implanted into the vertebrae, and the facro lumbalis to be implanted into the ribs. CXXVI. The longissimus dorsi is a mufcle of the fpine. It is not a flat mufcle, but round, thick, and firm, filling up all the hollow betwixt the fpine and the angle of the ribs. It is of a long form, as its name implies, terminating towards its top almoft in a point. It has two diftind fets of feet by which it is in- ferted ;

OF THE TRUNK. the 234 The ossa innominata, are the tv/o great irregu- lar bones, forming the Tides of the pelvis ; and they , have a form fo difficult to explain by one name, that they are called offa innominata, the namelefs bones. But thefe bones having been in the child formed in didindt and feparate pieces, thefe pieces retain their original names, though united into one great bone ; we continue to explain them as didindt bones by the names of os ilium, os ifchium, and os pubis. The os ilium, the haunch-bone, is that broad and expanded bone on which lie the ftrong mufcles of the thigh> and which forms the rounding of the haunch. The os jschium, the hip-bone, is the lowed: point of the pelvis, that on which we red in fitting. The os pubis, or fhare-bone, on which the private parts are placed. All thefe bones are divided in the child ; they are united In the very centre of the focket for the thigh-bone; and we find in the child a thick cartilage in the centre of the focket, and a prominent ridge of bone in the adult, ; which ridge, far from incommoding the arti- culation with the thigh-bone, gives a firmer hold to the cartilage which lines that cavity, and is the point into which a drong ligament from the head of the thigh-bone is implanted. The os ilium, or haunch-bone, is named from its forming the flank. It is the larged part of the os in- nominatum. It rifes upwards from the pelvis in the broad expanded wing, which forms the lower part of the cavity of the abdomen, and fupports the chief â– weight of the impregnated womb (for the womb com- monly inclines to one fide). The qs ilium is covered with

Upon its lower part, its groove is narrower, and receives the riling line in the middle of the palate plate, where the bones meet, to form the palate future. At its fore-part, it is united by a rag- ged furface, and by fomething like a groove, to the middle cartilage of the nofe; and as the vomer re- ceives the other bones into its grooves, it is, in a man- ner, locked in on all lides: it receives fupport and ftrength from each ; and if the vomer and its cartilage Ihould feem too llender a fupport for the fabric of the nofe, let it be remembered, that they are all firmly connected, and covered by one continuous membrane, which is thick and llrong, and that this is as a perio- fteum, or rather like a continued ligament, which in- creafes greatly the thicknefs and the ftrength of every one of thefe thin plates.

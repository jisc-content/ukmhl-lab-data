104 OF THE bones, &c. HOLES.â€”The holes of the lower jaw-bone are chiefly two. 1. A large hole on the inner fide, and above the angle of the jaw, juft; at the point where thefe two branches, the cpndyloid and the coronoid procefles part. A wide groove from above downwards, leads to the hole ; and the hole is, as it were, defended by a fmall point, or pike of bone, rifing up from its margin. This is the great hole for admitting the lower maxillary nerve into the hollow of the jaw, where it goes round within the circle of the jaw, diftributing its nerves to all the teeth. But at the point where this chief branch of the nerve goes down into the jaw, an- other branch of the nerve goes forward to the tongue. And as nerves make an impreflion as deep as that of arteries in a bone, we find here two grooves, firil, One marking the place of the great nerve, as it advances to- wards its hole ; and, fecondly, A fmaller groove, mark- ing the courfe of the leflfer branch, as it leaves the trunk, and paffes this hole to go forward to the tongue* Along with this nerve, the lower maxillary artery, a large branch, enters alfo by the hole ; and both the nerve and the artery, after having gone round the canal of the jaw, emerge again upon the chin. 2. The fecond hole of the lower jaw is that on the fide of the chin, about an inch from the point vfiich permits the remains of the great nerve and artery (almoft: expended upon the teeth) to come out upon the chin ; it is named the mental hole.

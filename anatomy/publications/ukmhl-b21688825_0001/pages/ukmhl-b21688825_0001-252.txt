XXIX. The oBLiouus superior arifes along with the reCti in the bottom of the eye, above and towards the inner fide ; directing its long tendon towards the inner angle of the eye ; and there it paffes its tendon through that pulley, whofe hollow I have marked in defcribing the os frontis, as under the fuperciliary ridge, and near to the inner corner of the eye. It arifes by a fmall tendon, like one of the reCti; it goes over the upper part of the eyeball, a long and flender mufcle, whence it is often named longissimus oculi, the long- eft mufcle of the eye. It forms a fmall fmooth round tendon, which paffes through the ring of the cartilagi- nous pulley, which is in the margin of the focket. The pulley is above the eye, and projects farther than the moft prominent part of the eyeball, fo that the tendon returns at an acute angle, and bends downwards before it can touch the eye ball. And it not only re- turns backwards in a direction oppofite to the recti mufcles, but it flips flat under the body of the reCtus fuperior, and is fpread out under it upon the middle, or behind the middle of the eye, viz. about half way betwixt the infertion of the rectus and the entrance of the opiic nerves. XXX. The obliquus inferior is, with equal pro- priety, named the musculus brevissimus oculi. It is

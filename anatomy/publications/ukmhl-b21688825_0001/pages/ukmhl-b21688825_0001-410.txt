3&> MUSCLES MOVIKG THE LEG. three inches of the ankle. It h another fmall flip of a head from the upper part of the tibia, above where the fibula joins; it has alfo adhefions to the tendinous partition, which feparates this from the extensor diÂ» gitorum communis and the soleus. Its tendon begins very high, above the middle of the leg; and it continues to receive the flefliy fibres almoft at right angles in the penniform manner. The tendon is concealed down to about or below the mid- dle of the leg: then it is feen immediately under the integuments ; and we can eafily diflinguifh it through the fkin, being that acute line or firing which runs down behind the inner ancle, and which gives fhape to that part. In palling the outer ankle, it runs down through a cartilaginous pulley or annular ligament, which alfo tranfmits the peronaeus brevis : it leaves the peronasus brevis on the fide of the foot; and pafflng by itfelf in a groove of the heel-bone, it bends obliquely acrofs the arch of the foot, goes quite down to the oppofite fide, and is inferted into the metatarfal bone of the great toe, and the great cuneiform bone on which it is founded. Under the eminence of the os cuboides it fuffers great fri&ion, fo as to be thickened to a degree of oflification, and to refemble a fefamoid bone. It is alfo thickened in a leffer degree as it pafles the outer ankle j and in all this length it is tied down by a flrong ligamentous expanfion. It is a powerful extenfor of the leg; it alfo gives that obliquity of the foot, which is fo handfome and na- tural, and ufeful in walking. This mufcle particular- ly turns down to the ground die inner edge of the foot j

BONES OF THE 172 the point of this defending procefs. A mufcle named coracoid, comes down from the joint of this procefs, and is inferted into the middle of the Aioulder-bone, to draw the arm towards the fide. Now the glenoid furface, and thefe two precedes, form the cavity for receiving the fhoulder-bone. But {till as if nature could not form a joint at once flrong and free, this joint, which performs quick, free, and eafy motions, is too fuperficial to be drong. Yet there is this compenfation, that the fhoulder-joint, which could not refill, if fairly expofed to {hocks and falls, belongs to the fcapula, which, Aiding eafily upon the ribs, yields, and fo eludes the force. Falls upon the fhoulder do not diAocate the fhoulder; that accident almoft always happens to us in putting out the hand to fave ourfelves from falls ; and the fhoulder is luxa- ted by a twiding of the arm, not by the force of a di- rect blow. The clavicle.â€”-The clavicle, or collar bone, named clavicle from its refemblance to an old falhion- ed key, is to the fcapula a kind of hinge or axis on which it moves and rolls; fo that the free motion of the fhoulder is made (till freer by the manner of its connection with the bread. The clavicle is placed at the root of the neck, and at the upper part of the bread. It extends acrofs from the tip of the Aioulder to the upper part of the der- num; it is a round bone, a little Aattened towards the end which joins the fcapula ; it is curved like an Italic f > having one curve turned out towards the bread 5 it is ufeful as an arch fupporting the Aioul-

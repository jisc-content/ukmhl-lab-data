MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. 297 The layer; the quadratus lumborum lies again under thefe, and next to the abdominal mufcles; and, laftly, the abdominal mufcles are the innermoft layer, and make the back part of the walls of the abdomen. Although the quadratus lumborum lies deep under the longiffimus dorfi mufcle, I fhall defcribe it firfl for the fake of a connection which will be prefently un~ derftood, CXXV. The quadratus lumborum is a fat fquared mufcle, named quadratus from its fquare o.r rather oblong form. It arifes flefhy from three or four inches of the back part of the os ilium, and from the ligaments of the pelvis, which tie the back part of the ilium to the fide of the facrurn and to the tranfverfe precedes of the loins. As it goes upwards along the fide of the lumbar vertebras, it takes hold of the points of the tranfverfe proceffes of each by fmall tendinous flips ; fo that we are almoft at a lofs whether to con- fider thefe as new origins or as infertions : but its chief infertion is into the lower edge of the laft rib, and a fmall production of it flips under the arch of the diaphragm, to be implanted into the body or fore part of the laft vertebra of the back. The longissimus dorsi and sacro lumbalis have their origin in one common and broad tendon, com- ing from the facrurn, ilium, and loins; the two muf- cles lie along fide of each other ; the longifliinus dorfi is nearer the fpine, and keeps its tendons clofer by the fpine. The facro lumbalis is farther- from the fpine, and fpreads its tendinous feet broader upon the fides of the thorax ; and if one be a little under the other, it is the outer edge of the longiffimus dorfi, which is a little under the edge cf the iumbar mufcle.

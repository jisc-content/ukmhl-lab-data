INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL, jrj gradually fmaller as it advances towards the ear; it is cartilaginous in almofl its whole length; very little of it confifts of firm bone ; fo that the lludent, in ex- amining the fkull, will hardly find the Euflachian tube; for the cartilage being rotten away, nothing is left but that end of the canal that is nexc the ear, and which is open both above and below, ragged, ir- regular and broken. When we have a fore throat, the pain extends up along this tube- into the ear; when we have a cold, both our voice and our hearing is hurt; the one by the fluffing of the finufes, the other by the fluffing of the Euflachian tube. When we ffiut the nofe and mouth, and blow ftrongly we feel a crackling in the ear, as in the place of the Euflachian tube ; when we dive, we feel the fame, by the condenfation of the air; and fometimes by forcing the air ftrongly up- wards through the ear, or by vomits, obftrudlion of the Euflachian tube, and the deafnefs which attends that accident, are very fuddenly, and we may fay, violently removed $ or fometimes the cure is attempt- ed by fyringing, or by cleaning the mouth of this tube with a probe, juft as we do the external ear. The other holes do not relate to the ear, and are chiefly for tranfmitting the great blood-veffels of the brain. 1. The carotid artery, the chief artery of the brain, enters into the fkull near the point of the pe- trous bone, and juft before the root of the ftyloid prc- cefs. The artery goes firft diredlly upwards, then ob- liquely forwards through the bone, and then again upwards, to emerge upon the infide of the fkull; fo f 4 that

OF THE FACE AND JAWS. 37 angle of the eye, at its forepart, and juft touching the top of the nofe ; it has a large groove in it for holding the lachrymal fac and du£t. One half of this bone is behind the groove, and there the eye rolls upon it. One half of it is occupied by the groove for the nafal duft ; and the other fide of the groove is formed by the riling branch, or nafal procefs, as it is called, of the up- per jaw-bone. The os unguis is delicate, and eafily broken, being as thin as a fheet of paper. It is this bone which is pierced in the operation for the fiftula lachrymalis 3 which is eafily done, almoft with a blunt fteel or probe; and the chief caution is to keep for- wards, fo as to perforate in the place of the groove, as that will lead into the nofe, and not behind it, which would carry the perforating inftrument into the seth- moidal linufes, and perhaps wound the fpongy bone. This bone feems peculiarly liable to caries, which is perhaps the nature of all thefe thin bones j for as they have no marrow, they muft depend entirely on their periofteum, which they are no fo'oner robbed of than they die. Ossa maxillaria superiora.—The upper jaw- bones are particularly worthy of notice ; for here we find all that is curious in the face, even to its fize and lhape. The upper jaw-bones are of very great fize, forming as it were the foundation or bafis of the face. They fend a large branch upwards, which forms the fides of the nofe; a broad plate goes backwards, which forms the roof of the palate 5 there is a circular projec- tion below, which forms the alveoli, or fockets of the teeth. The upper jaw-bones are quite hollow within, forming a very large cavity, which is capable of com 4 p 4 iaining

MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG. The fefhy belly, it degenerates into a tendon, efpecially on its back part; and this tendon, which begins above the middle of the thigh, is continued the whole way down. About one third down the bone is the beginning of the fecond or fhort head, which has its origin all the way down the linea afpera to the line above the outer condyle of the thigh-bone ; and here it is fomewhat connected with the origin of the vaftus externus mufcle and the infertion of the gluteus magnus. The tendons of the two heads are joined a little above the inner con- dyle, and go outwards to be inferted into the outer part of the head of the fibula, forming the outer hamfiring. Its infertion furrounds the head of the fibula, and a fmall portion alfo finks betwixt the bump of the fibula and the inner head of the tibia, to be implanted into This rnufcle, like the oppofite ones, ferves for bend- ing the kg. The fhort head Amply bends the leg j the long head affifls the fhort one in bending the leg, and is alfo a mufcle of the thigh.

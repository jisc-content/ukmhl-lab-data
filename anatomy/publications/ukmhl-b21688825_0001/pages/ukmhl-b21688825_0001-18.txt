PREFACE* XU ££ In our branch, thofe teachers who take but little ££ pains to demoftrate the parts of the body with pre- ££ cifion and clearnefs, but ftudy to captivate young ££ minds with ingenious fpeculation, will not leave a ££ reputation that will outlive them half a century. ££ I always have ftudied, and fhall continue my en- ££ deavours, to employ the time that is given up to ana- ££ tomical ftudies as ufefully to the ftudents as I can ££ poffibly make it—and therefore fhall never aim at ££ fhowing what I know, but labour to (how and de- £C fcribe, as clearly as poflible, what they ought to ££ know. This plan rejeds all declamation, all parade, ££ all wrangling, all fubtility: to make a lhow, and to ££ appear learned and ingenious in natural knowledge, ££ may flatter vanity; to know fads, to feparate them ££ from fuppofitions, to range and conned them, to ££ make them plain to ordinary capacities, and above ££ all to point out the ufeful applications— is, in my ££ opinion, much more laudable, and fhall be the ob- t£ jed of my ambition * Introdu&ory Le&ure publifhed by Dr. llunter, ♦ Edinburgh, Sept.1793.

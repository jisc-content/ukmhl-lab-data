INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. 65 h regular circle) are turned and fmoothed; a little thicker at the lip, and having a roughnefs behind that, giving a firm hold to a ligament, which, departing from this hole, goes down through the whole cavity of the fpine, forming at once a fheath for the fpina! marrow, and a ligament for each individual bone. There pafles down through this great hole the fpinal marrow, and the vertebral vein. There come up through it the vertebral arteries, which are of great importance and fize ; and a fmall nerve, which, from its coming backwards from the fpine to affifl certain nerves of the brain, is named the fpinal acceffary nerve. 2. The fecond hole is placed a little behind the ring of the foramen magnum, and juft at the root of either condyle, is round, and large, eafily found, and fome- times it is double ; it tfanfmits the ninth pair, or great lingual nerve. 3. There is another hole fmaller, and lefs regular than this laft. It is exactly behind the condyle, while the lingual hole is before it. It is for permitting a fmall vein, the cervical vein of the neck, to enter and drop its blood into the great lateral finus ; but often it is not formed, and this trifling vein gets in by the great occipital hole. 4. We fhall defcribe with the temporal bone that wide hole which is common to the temporal and oc- cipital bones, and which tranfmits the great lateral fmus.

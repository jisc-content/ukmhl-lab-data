93 OF THE FACE AND JAWS, the two firft cutting teetth. This hole is named fo- ramen incisivum, as opening juft behind the incifive or cutting teeth ; or it is named anterior palatine hole, to diftinguifh it from one in the back of the palate: This hole is large enough to receive the point of a quill; it is fingle towards the mouth 5 but to- wards the nofe, it has two large openings, one open- ing diftinftly into each noftrih 3. But it will be well to explain here a third hole, which is common to 'the maxillary with the proper- palate bones. It is formed on the back part of. the palate (one on either fide), in the future which joins the palate-bones to the jaw-bones ; It is named pos^ terior palatine hole : It is as large as the interior palatine hole, but it ferves a much more important purpofe ; for the upper maxillary nerve fends a large branch to the palate, which branch comes down be- hind the back of the noftrii, perforates the back of the palate, by the pofterior palatine hole, and then goes forward in two great branches along the palate. Thus the chief, or, we might fay, the only nerves of the palate come down to it through thefe pofterior palatine holes; but the ufe of the anterior palatine hole is a problem ftill; for we cannot believe that fo great a hole, fo very regular, and fo curioufly divided, fo as to open into the two noftrils, can be quite ufe- lefs ; yet the meaning of this hole has never been ex*, plained. It looks almoft as if it were merely defigned for giving the foft palate a furer hold upon the bene j for no dmfts have been found opening into the palate from the nofe ; nor any glands with their dudts feated here; nor any nerves palling either from the nofe to ; the

*37 OF THE TRUNK. of the focket; whence the focket is named Acetabulum Ifchii, as peculiarly belonging to this bone. The bump or round fwelling upon, which we reft, is named the Tuber Ifchii 5 and the fmaller part, which extends up- wards to meet the os pubis, is named the Ramus, or branch, which meets a ftmilar branch of that bone, to form the thyroid hole. The body is the uppermoft, and thicker part of the bone, which helps in forming the focket; and among the three bones this one forms the largeft fliare of it; nearly one half. From the body, a ftiarp pointed pro- cefs, named spinous process of the ifchium, is project- ed backwards; and this fpinous procefs pointing towards the lower end of the facrum, receives the uppermoft of two long ligaments, which, from their paffmg betwixt the ifchium and facrum, are named facro-fciatic. By this ligament a femicircle of the os ilium, juft below the joining of the ilium with the facrum, is completed into a large round hole ; which is in like manner named the facro-fciatic hole, and gives paffage to the great nerve of the lower extremity, named the great facro- fciatic nerve. The tuber, or round knob, being the point upon which we reft, this bone has been often named os se- Denxarium. The bump is a little flattened when we fit upon it. It is the mark by which the iithotomift directs his incifion ; cutting exaftly in the middle be- twixt the anus and this point of bone. It is remark- able as the point towards which the pofterior or lower facro-fciatic ligament extends; and as a point which gives rife to feveral of the ftrong mufcles on the back of the thigh, and efpecially to thofe which form the jhamftrings.

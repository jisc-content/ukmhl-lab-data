muscles moving the toes. the foot it crofles the tendon of the flexor pollicis, from which it receives a flip of tendon; and thus the office of either is affifted by the other, and could be wholly fupplied by it; it then pafifes over to the mid- dle of the foie, and growing flatter and thicker, divides into four flat tendons. Thefe go forward, diverging till they arrive at the ends of their metatarfal bones j then they emerge from the aponeurofis plantaris, along with the common fhort flexor. Now both thefe ten- dons run under a ligamentous {heath, and are included in it under the firfl: and fecond bones of the toes $ and having perforated the fhort flexor oppofite to the fecond joint, they are finally inferted into the root of the third or lafl: bone of each toe. Thefe tendons, like the correfponding ones of the foot, feem to be flit with a fort of longitudinal fiflure. The proper ufe of this mufcle is to bend all the joints of the toes, but more peculiarly the lafl bone; and alfo to extend the foot, keeping the point of the toes to the ground, confequently alfifting the gaftroc- nemii, and all the mufcles ufed in walking, &c. CXC. The mass a carnea Jacobi S ylvii, or plan* 'tje pedis, is a fmall body of flefli, naturally con- nected with the flexor longus. The mafia carnea arifes from the lower part of the heel-bone, in two di- vifions; one (the external one) tendinous, the other fiefhy. It is, upon the whole pretty nearly of a fquare form *, it joins the tendon of the flexor longus before its divifion into tendons for each toe : and by the long lever that this has upon the heel-bone it mull be of great afliftance to the flexor. It is more generally con- fidered in this light of a fupplementary mufcle; by forn a-

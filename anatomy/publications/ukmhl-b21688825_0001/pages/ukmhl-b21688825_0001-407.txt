363 MUSCLES MOVING THE LEG, The Flexor is, C lying on the fore part of The TIBIALIS ANTICUS. > 6, ^ l the leg. CLXXXT. The gastrocnemius is often divided into three mufcles, named gastrocnemii or gemelli. But, far from counting thus, we fhould rather favour the arrangement of Douglas, who couples this with the next mufcle, as forming a quadriceps or two mufi. cles joined with two heads each, and he calls it thq EXTENSOR CRURALIS. The gastrocnemius is the great mufcle of -the brawn ; its two heads are two very large and flefhy bellies, which arife from the tubercles of the thigh-, bone. The inner head is the larger, and arifes by a ftrong tendon from the back of the inner condyle, and a little way up the rough line; and it has alfo a ftrong adhefion to the capfular ligament of the knee. The outer head is fhorter than this: It arifes in the fame way, from the outer tubercle of the thigh- bone and the two mufcles meet and run down to- gether, forming the appearance of a rapha, by the direction of their fibres. But the two bellies continue diftind till they meet in the middle of the leg. They are diftind at their back part, but at their fore part they are conneded by a tendinous aponeurofis, or ftrong but flat tendon; and the two bellies being about the middle of the leg united firmly, they form a large flat tendon, very broad at its beginning, which unites with that of the foleus a little above the ankle.

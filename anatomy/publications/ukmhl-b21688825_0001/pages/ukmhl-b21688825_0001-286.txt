242 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. vide; a head from the acromion or tip of the ihouider j a head from the ridge of the fpine ; each divided from the other by a fatty line #. Thefe heads or bundles of fibres, meeting about one-third down the humerus, form a Ihort flat, and ftrong tendon, which grafps or almoft furrounds the fhoulder-bone. Thefe three diftinft heads muft be obferved in fpeaking of the ufe of the mufcle; for though the chief ufe of the mufcle be to raife the arm, this is not the ufe of it in all circumftances. For the outer and inner heads, lying by the fide of the lhoulder- bone, and below the joint, do, when the arm is lying flat by the fide, aflift the pe&oral and Iatiflimus dorfi mufcles in drawing it clofe to the fide; but when the middle bundle raifes the arm, in proportion as it raifes the arm it lofes of its power; and in proportion as it lofes of its power, the fide portions, having come into a new direction, begin to help : Nay, when the arm is raifed to a certain point, more power Hill is required, and the clavicular part of the peftoral mufcle alfo comes to aflift. It is in this fucceflion that the feveral bun- dles of fibres aft; for if they began all at once to a<ft, the arm Ihould rather be bound down by the lateral portions than raifed by the middle one. LXXII. Coraco brachialis.â€”The coraco bra- chialis, fo named from its origin and infertion, is a long and rather flender mufcle. It arifes from the coracoid procefs of the fcapula, along with the Ihort head of the biceps mufcle j and # * Albinus has diftinguifhed it into feven fafciculi or bundles ; a very fuperfluous accuracy. it

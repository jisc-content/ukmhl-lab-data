230 MUSCLES OF THE LXI. The LVIII. The firft mufcle of the tongue is the stylo* glossus, which arifes from the ftyloid procefs, goes obliquely downwards and forwards; it touches the tongue a little before the angle of the tongue ; it makes part of the fleih at the fide of the tongue, ex- panding into its fubftance in fomewhat of a radiated f&rm; its office is to pull the tongue backwards into the mouth. LIX. The hyo-glossus is a comprehenfive name for all thofe mufcles which arife from the os hyoides. The mufcles from the os hyoides go off in three faf- piculi, and were once reckoned as diftinct mufcles. That the portion which arifes from the bafis of the os hyoides, wras called basio-glossus ; that which arifes from the cartilaginous joining of the body and horn, was called chondro-glossus ; and that which arifes from the horn itfelf, was named cerato-glossus ; or the terms were all bundled together into the perplexed names of basio-chondro-cerato-glossus. , The hyo-gloffus, then, is all that mufcular flefh which arifes from the whole length of the os hyoides ; and which, by the changing form of the bone in its bafis, cartilage, and horn, has flight marks of divifion, but which lies all in one plain, and need not have diftinct names. LX. The genio-glossus arifes from the rough tun bercle behind the fymphyfis of the chin. It has a very- narrow or pointed origin; it fpreads out fan-like, as it goes towards the tongue; and it fpreads with ra- dii, both forwards and backwards, making the chief part of the fubftance of the tongue.

The thoracic end, that next the fternum, or what may be called the inner head of the clavicle, is round and flat, or button-like ; and it is received into a fuit- able hollow on the upper piece of the fternum. It is not only like other joints furrounded by a capfule or purfe; it is further provided with a fmall moveable cartilage, which (like a fridlion-wheel in machinery) faves the parts, and facilitates the motion, and moves continually as the clavicle rolls. 2. But the outer end of the clavicle is flattened as it approaches the fcapula, and the edge of that flat- nefs is turned to the edge of the flattened acromion, fo that they touch but in one Angle point. This outer end of the clavicle, and the correfponding point of the acromion, are flattened and covered with a cruft of cartilage: but the motion here is very flight and quite infenftble ; they are tied firmly by ftrong ligaments ; and we may confider this as almoft a fixed point; for there is little motion of the fcapula upon the clavicle j but there is much motion of the clavicle upon the breaft: for the clavicle ferves as a fiiaft or axis, firm- ly tied to the fcapula, upon which the fcapula moves and turns, being connected with the trunk only by this Angle point, viz. the articulation of the clavicle with the breaft-hone. The os humeri is one of the trueft of the cylindrical bones 5 it is round in the middle j but it appears twilled and

182 BONES OF THE 5. The upper head is exceedingly fmall and round, while the lower head fwells out, broad and flat, to receive the bones of the wrifl:. There are two great- er bones in the wrifl:, which form a large ball, and this ball is received into the lower end of the radius : the impreflion which thefe two bones make there is pretty deep, and fomewhat of a boat-like fhape; whence it is called (like the articulating furface of the tibia) the fcaphoid cavity of the radius; and on the edge of the radius, next to the thumb, the bone ends in a fort of peak or Iharper point, which is named (though with very little meaning) the styloid pro- cess of the radius. So the fcaphoid cavity of the radius forms the joint with the wrifl:; but there is another fmall cavity, ori the fide of the radius, near to the little head of the ulna, into which this leflfer head of the ulna is receiv- ed ; and this is inclofed in a proper and diftinct cap- fule. The little head of the ulna does not defcend fo low as to have any fhare in forming the wrifl. There are properly two diftin&r joints ; the great joint of the wrifl, moving upon the radius, the other a little joint within this of the radius, rolling upon the ulna, and- carrying the wrifl along with it. OF THE HAND AND FINGERS. The wrifl is the mofl complex part of all the bony fyftem, and is beft explained in a general way, by mark- ing the three divifions of the hand, into the carpus or wrifl bones ; the metacarpus, or bones that ftand up- on the wrifl; and the fingers, confiding each of its three joints. 1. The carpus or wrifl is a congeries of eight

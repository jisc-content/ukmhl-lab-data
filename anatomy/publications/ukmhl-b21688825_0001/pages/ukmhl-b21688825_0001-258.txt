MUSCLES GF THE d! 4 the chief mufcles which either raife or deprefs the throat> and it is the point dâ€™appui, or fulcrum for all the mufcles of the throat and tongue, and the centre of all their motions. It is the centre of the motions of the tongue ; for it is the origin of thefe mufcles which compofe chiefly the bulk of the tongue ; of the motions of the trachea or windpipe, for it forms at once the top of the windpipe, and the root of the tongue, and joins them together ; of the motions of the pharynx or gullet, for its horns furround the upper part of the gullet, and join it to the windpipe ; and it forms the centre for all the motions of the throat in general, for mufcles come down from the chin to the os hy- oides, to move the whole throat upwards, others come up from the flernum, to move the throat down- wards ; others come obliquely from the coracoid pro- cefs of the fhoulder-blade, to move the throat back- wards, while the os hyoides (till continues the centre of all thefe motions. The trachea, or windpipe, is that tube which conveys the air to the lungs ; and the larynx is the head, or figured part of that tube which is formed like a flute for the modulation of the voice, and con- fifls of cartilages, that it may Hand firm and uncom- preffed, either by the paflage of the food, or by the weight of the outward air ; and that it may refill; the contraction of the furrounding parts, ferving as a ful- crum for them in the motions of the jaw, tongue, and gullet. Its cartilages are, firft, the scutiform, or thy- roid cartilage, which is named from its refemblance to a Ihield, or rather it is like the flood-gates or folding doors of a canal, the meeting of the two Tides being in tl?e %

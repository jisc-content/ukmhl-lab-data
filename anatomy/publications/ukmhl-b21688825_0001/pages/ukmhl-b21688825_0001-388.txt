344 MUSCLES MOVING THE THIGH-BONE. triceps brevis, and triceps longus. The triceps brevis is exceedingly like the former, in rifing near the fym, phifis pubis, by a thick and flattened tendon, fwelling like it into a ftrong fleftty belly; like it, it grows flat, and is inferted by a fliort flat tendon into the inner trochanter and linea afpera. But it differs in thefe points: that it is lefs oblique; for this mufcle being fhorter, goes more diredtly acrofs betwixt the pelvis and the thigh : that it is placed higher than the laft; fo that whereas the addudtor longus is inferted into the middle of the thigh bone, this one is inferted into the lelfer trochanter, and only the upper part of the linea afpera; and the triceps longus is a fuperficial mufcle, while this is hidden under it and behind it. The longus takes its rife from the very creft of the pubis; this takes its origin front the fore part of the pubis, from the limb juft under the creft, fo as to be. immediately under the head of the longus. 3. The adductor magnus, the third head of the triceps, is a very long and flat mufcle, lying behind the other heads. It arifes by a fliort tendon, juft under the tendon of the adductor brevis: it continues to have a flelhy origin all down the ramus and the tu- ber ifchii (i. e.), from the flat edge of the thyroid hole. From this broad origin it goes to be implanted into the thigh-bone the whole length of the linea af- pera, its fibres having various degrees of obliquity ac- cording to their infertion ; for the uppermoft fafciculi go almoft directly acrofs, to be inferted flat into 1 he upper part of the linea afpera; the fucceeding fafci- culi go more and more obliquely as they defcend, the lower part of the mufcle following that rough line which

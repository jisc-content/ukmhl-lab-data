OF THE TRUNK, 130 the os facrum behind, the offa innominata oht either fide,. and the os coccygis below. Os sacrum. The names os facrum, os bafilare, &c. feem to relate rather to the greater fize of this bone, than to its ever having been offered in facrifice.

The bones of which the facrum is compofed, have originally the form of diftinct fmall vertebras. Thefe diftinttions are loft in the adult, or are recognized only by the marks of former lines 5- for the original* vertebras are now united into one large and firm bone, whicli is named the column of falfe vertebrae j becaufe ha- ving no motion, it wants the chief character and ufe of the true ones. We can recognize the original vertebrae even in the adult bone, for we find it regularly perforated with holes for the tranfmiffion of the fpinal nerves ; we find thefe holes regularly difpofed in pairs ; we fee a diftincf white and riling line which erodes the bone, in the interface of each of the original vertebras, and marks the place where the cartilage once was ; and by thefe lines being five in number, with five pairs of holes, we know this bone to have confided once of five pieces, which are now joined into one. The re- mains of former procelfes can alfo be diftinguilhed; and

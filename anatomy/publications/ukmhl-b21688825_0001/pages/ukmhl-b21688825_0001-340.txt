296 OF THE HEAD'AND HECK. The obliquus superior and obliquus inferior correfpond very clofely in all things with the recti; but in their oblique direction the uppermoft, as being much fhorter, has been named obliquus minor, the lower one obliquus major. CXXIII. The obliquus superior arifes from the tranfverfe procefs of the atlas, and is inferted into the end of the lower occipital ridge. Its ufe, notwith- ftandings its oblique pofition, is not to turn, but to bend, the head backwards ; for the occipital condyles are not concentric circles. Its infertion into the occiput is un- der the fplenius and complexus ; but one edge of it is above the infertion of the redtus major. CXXIV. The obliquus inferior rifes from one vertebra and goes to another. It arifes from the fpine of the fecond vertebra : it goes to the tranfverfe pro- cefs of the firll; and it meets the fuperior oblique mufcle; and, by the long lever or arm of the firll vertebra, obtaiqs great power. The firll vertebra or atlas rolls on the tooth-like procefs of the dentatus ; and while the great and flow motions of the neck in general are performed by other mufcles, the fhort and quick turnings of the head are performed entirely by thefe oblique mufcles. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. The great mufcles which move the back and loins are the quadratus lumborum, sacro lumbalis, and longissimus dorsi. The facro lumbalis and longiflimus dorfi lie imme- diately under the latifiimus dorfi, which is the outer layer;

MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 249 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. The mufcles of the fore-arm are only four; the bi- ceps and brachialis for bending, and the triceps and anconal us for extending. LXXVIII. Biceps brachii flexor is univerfally named biceps, from its having two very diftind heads. It is an exceedingly thick and ftrong mufcle; for when it contrafts, we feel it almoft like a hard firm ball upon the fore part of the arm; and at the upper and moft confpicuous part of this ball is the union of the two heads. The larger and thicker head arifes from the cora- coid procefs, by a tendon which extends three inches along the fore part of the mufcle, in the form of an aponeurofis ; but at the back part the tendon is fhort, and the mufcle is ftefhy, and is attached there to the flelhy belly of the coraco-brachialis. The fecond, or long head, arifes from the edge of the glenoid cavity, at its upper part; it is exceedingly fmall and tendinous, and this long tendon runs down in its proper cavity, till, about one-third down the arm, the two heads meet. And though below that it is but one flelhy belly, yet there, as in other mufcles, the common divifion betwixt its two origins may be ftill obferved. It is earlier tendinous at the fore part and outer fide; the tendon there fends off that aponeurotic ex- panfion which covers all the fore-arm below, and en- clofes its mufcles as in a Iheath. The tendon, at firft flat and large, becomes gradually fmaller and rounder ^ it turns a little in its defcent, fo as to lay one flat edge to

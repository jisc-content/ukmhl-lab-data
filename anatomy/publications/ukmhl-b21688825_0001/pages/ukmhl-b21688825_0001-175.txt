I K 2 The of The trunk. 13x the back of the bone is rough and irregular from the old fpines. The os facrum, thus compofed, is among the lighted bones of the human body ; with the mod fpongy fub« dance; the thinned tables; the mod eadly broken; and its injuries of the mod formidable nature : but then it is a bone the bed cemented ; and confirmed by drong ligaments ; and the bed covered by thick and cufhion- like mufcles. The os facrum is of a triangular fhape ; the bafe of the triangle turned upwards to receive the fpine 5 its inner furface is fmooth, to permit the head of the child in labour to glide eafily along ; and its outer furface is irregular and rough, with the fpines of former vertebra, giving rife to the great glutaei muf- cles (which form the contour of the hip), and to all the dronged mufcles of the back and loins. It has in it a triangular cavity under the arch of its fpinous procefies ; which cavity is continued from the canal in the vertebras of the fpine j and this cavity of the facrum contains the continuation and the end of the fpinal marrow ; which being in this place divided into a great many thread-like nerves, has altogether the form of a horfe’s tail, and is therefore named cauda equina. From this triangular cavity, the nerves of the cauda equina go out by the five-great holes on the fore part, of the facrum ; holes large enough to receive the point of the finger. The three fird nerves of the facrum, join- ing with the lad' nerve of the loins, form the facro- fciatic nerve; the larged in the body; which goes down- ward to the leg : while the two lower nerves of the fa- crum fupplv the contents of the pelvis alone.

SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. 183 eight frnall bones; grouped together into a very nar- row fpace; very firmly tied together by crofs liga- ments ; making a fort of ball or nucleus, a folid foun- dation or centre for the reft of the hand. 2. ^he me- tacarpus is formed of five long bones, founded upon the carpal bones; and which, departing from that centre, in fomewhat of a radiated form, give, by their fize and ftrength, a firm fupport to each individual finger, and, by their radiated or fpoke-like form, al- low the fingers freer play. 3. The fingers, confiding each of three very moveable joints, are fet free upon the metacarpus; fo as to Ihow a curious gradation of moving in all thefe parts ; for the carpal bones are grouped together into a frnall nucleus, firm, almoft immoveable, and like the nave of a wheel; then the metacarpal bones, founded upon this, are placed like the fpokes or fellies of the wheel, and have a freer mo- tion ; and laftly, the fingers by the advantage of this radiated form in the bones upon which they are pla- ced, move very nimbly, and have a rotatory as well as a hinge-like motion. So that the motion is gra- duated and proportioned in each divifion of the hand ; and even where there is no motion, as in the carpus, there is an elafticity, which, by gentle bendings, ac- commodates itfelf to the more moveable parts. The carpus, or wrist.â€”-Looking upon the exter- nal furface of the carpus, we count eight frnall bones difpofed in two rows, with one bone only a little remov- ed from its rank; and we obferve that the whole is arched outwards, to refill injuries, and to give ftrength; and that the bones lie like a pavement, or like the (tones of an arch, with their broader ends turned out- n 4 wards.

INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. e'ior clynoid processes, rife about an inch further backwards, and are, as it were, oppofed to the others* They rife in one broad and flat procefs, which divides above into two points, fmall and round, or knobby at their points ; and they look forwards towards the an- terior clynoid procefles.. TheCELLATURCiCA EPHiPPiuM,or Turkifh faddle, is the fpace inclofed by thefe four procefles., and is well named. The cella turcica fupports the pituitary gland, an appendage of the brain, the ufe of which is unknown. The carotid arteries rife up by the Tides of the cella turcica, and mark its Tides with a broad groove. The optic nerves lie upon a groove at the fore part of the cella turcica, betwixt the two anterior clynoid procefles 5 and fometimes the two anterior pro- cedes ft retch backwards, till they meet the pofterior ones, and form an arch, under which the carotid ar- tery paffes. Often the pofterior clynoid knobs cannot be fairly diftinguifned; fmce, in many lkulls, they form but one broad procefs. This bone has alfo its cells, for all that part which we call the body of the bone, all the cella turcica, that fpace which is betwixt the clynoid procefles within and the azygous procefs without, is hollowed into one large cell, divided with a middle partition* It is indeed lefs regular than the other cells ; it is fome- times very large, fometimes it is not to be found 5 it has other trifling varieties, which it were idle to deÂ«* fcribe. As it communicates with the sethmoid cells, it probably performs one office with them ; is almoft a continuation of them, fo that when any one is lefs or awanting, the others are proportionally larger* VQij.

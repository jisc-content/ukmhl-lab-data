300 MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK* the Both thefe mufcles, viz. the longiflimus and facro- lumbalis, terminate in points which reach towards the neck ; and under the point of each there lie the roots of two fmall mufcles, which go up to move the neck. Many have referred thefe flips going up into the neck entirely to the mufcles I am now defcribing j calling one an afcending flip of the longiflimus dorfi, and the other a flip of the facro-lumbalis ; while others have defcribed them as didinCt mufcles, having but flight conned oils with the longiflimus and facro lumbalis. Their proper names are cervicalis descendens, and TRANSVERSAL IS COLLI. CXXVIII. The cervicalis descendens is connect- ed with the facro-lumbalis mufcle; it cannot be en- tirely referred to it, for the cervicalis defcendens arifes as a didinCt mufcle from the five lower vertebrae of the neck at their tranfverfe precedes; goes downwards very fmall and (lender to be inferted into the fix upper- mod ribs, to get at which it flips under the longed ten- dons of the facro lumbalis : but that the cervicalis de- fcendens does not belong to the facro-lumbalis, may be inferred from its having didinCt tendons from fix ribs, and from fix tranfverfe precedes of the neck, and from thefe tendons being in a direction which does not at all correfpond with the heads of the facro-lumbalis. Indeed the longiflimus dorfi has a better claim to this mufcle ; for a long flip, partly tendinous and partly fleflry, runs upwards from the longed tendon of the longiflimus dorfi, to join itfelf to the cervicalis defcendens *. CXXIX. The * Hence it is plain that the facro lumbalis and longiflimus dorfi have nearly an equal claim to the cervicalis defcendens, for, firft,

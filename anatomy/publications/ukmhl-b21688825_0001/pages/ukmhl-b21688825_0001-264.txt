2 20 MUSCLES OF'THE mylo-hyoideus is named from the whole jawr. The g-enio-hyoideus is named from the chfn, arifmg from a fmali tubercle behind the chin; its beginning is ex- ceedingly narrow: as it proceeds downwards, it grows flat and broad ; it is implanted into the bafis of the os hyoides by a broad edge, and is a beautiful and ra~ diated mufcle. The fublingual gland lies flat betwixt this mufcle and the laft; and in the middle the fub- iingual dudt pierces the membrane of the mouth, to open under the root of the tongue. The two mufcles move the os hyoides forwards and upwards, when the jaw is fixed; but when the os hyoides is fixed by the mufcles coming from the fternum, thefe mufcles of the os hyoides pull the jaw down. XXXIX. The stylo-hyoideus is one of three beau- tiful and flender mufcles, which come from round the Ilyloid procefs; which all begin and end with flender tendons, and with finall fleihy bellies ; and one going to the pharynx or gullet, another to the os hyoides, and a third to the tongue, they coincide in one com- mon adtion of drawing back the tongue, and pulling the throat upwards. This one, the ftylo-hyoideus, arifes from about the middle of the ftyloid procefs, and going obliquely downwards and forwards, is fixed into the fide of the os hyoides, where the bafis and horn are joined. Above its infertion, its fibres are fplit, fo as to make a neat fmali loop, through which the tendon of the digaftric mufcle runs. This ftylo-hyoideus is fome- times accompanied with another finall flefhy mufcle like it, and of the fame name ; which was firfl perhaps obferved

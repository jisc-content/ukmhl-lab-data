THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT. 15jgp * tion of this bone upon the knee removes the acting force from the centre of motion, fo as to increafe the power ; and it is beautifully contrived, that while the knee is bent, and the mufcles at reft, as in fitting, the patella finks down concealed into a hollow of the knee. When the mufcles begin to ad, the patella be- gins to rife from this hollow; in proportion as they contrad, they lofe of their ftrength, but the patella gradually riftng, increafes the power; and when the contraction is nearly perfed, the patella has rifen to the fummit of the knee, fo that the riling of the pa- tella raifes the mechanical power of the joint in exad proportion as the contradion expands the living con- tradible power of the mufcles. What is curious beyond almoft any other fad concerning the fradures of bones, the patella is feldom broken by a fall or blow; in nine of ten cafes, it is rather torn, if we may ufe the expreffion, by the force of its own muf- cles, while it Hands upon the top of the knee, fo as to reft upon one fmgle point; for while the knee is half-bended, and the patella in this dangerous fitua- tion, the leg fixed, and the mufcles contrafhng ftrong- ly to fupport the weight of the body, or to raife it as in mounting the fteps of a flair, the force of the muf- cles is equivalent at leaft to the weight of the manâ€™s body; and often, by a hidden violent exertion, their power is fo much increafed, that they fnap the patella acrofs, as we would break a flick acrofs the knee. The tarsus, or instep, is compofed of feven large bones, which form a firm and elaftic arch for fup- porting the body; which arch has its ftrength from the ftrong ligaments with which thefe bones are joined.

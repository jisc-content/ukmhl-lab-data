33 AND GROWTH OF BONES. able, from its own peculiar veffels, to heal a breach, or to repair any lofs ? We have no reafon to refer the generation of callus to the marrow, to the peri- ofleum, nor to the fubflance of the bone itfelf; for they are but parts of the common fyflem of a bone ; and each part of this fyflem is of itfelf capable of re- generating the whole. How little the conflitution of a bone has been underflood, we may know from the (Irange debates which have fubfifled fo long about the proper organ for generating callus. Some have pronounced it to be the periofleum; others the me- dullary veffel, and internal membrane; others the fub- flance of the bone itfelf: but \ have been employed in explaining, that not only any part of the bone, periofleum, or marrow, but even any artery in all the fyflem, may affume that action which generates bone. In the heat of this difpute, one of the mofl eminent anatomifls produced a difeafed bone, where a new bone had been formed furrounding a carious one, and the fpoiled bone rattled within the cavity of the found one. Here we fhould have been ready to pro- nounce, that bone could be formed by the periofleum alone. But prefently another anatomifl produced the very reverfe, viz. a found young bone, forming in the hollow cylinder of a bone which had been long dead ; where, of courfe, the callous matter mull have been poured into the empty cavity of the fpoiled bone, from the ends which flill remained found, or mufl have been fecreted by the medullary veffels. But the truth is, that callus may be thus produced from any part of the fyflem of a bone; from its periofleum, â€¢ from its medulla, or from the fubftance of the bone vol. I. d itfelf*

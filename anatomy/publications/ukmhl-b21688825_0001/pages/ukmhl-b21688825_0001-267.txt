Arytenoideus obliquus, is one which crofles in a more oblique dire&ion, arifmg at the root of each arytenoid cartilage, and going obliquely up- wards to the point of the oppofite one. Thefe two muf- cles draw the arytenoid cartilages together, and clofe the rima. XLV. The crico arytenoideus posticus, is a fmall pyramidal mufcle, which arifes broader from the back part of the cricoid cartilage, where the ring is broad and deep ; and going direftiy upwards, is im- planted with a narrow point into the back of the ary- tenoid cartilage. This pair of mufcles pulls the ary- tenoid cartilages direffly backwards, and lengthens the flit of the glottis. XLVI.The crico arytenoideus obliquus, is one which comes from the fides of the cricoid cartilage, where it lies under the wing of the thyroid, and being implanted into the fides of the arytenoid cartilages, near their roots, mull pull thefe cartilages afurder, and (as the origin in the cricoid lies rather before their infertion in the arytenoid cartilages) it muff alfo flacken the lips of the flit; for the lips of the flit are formed by two cords, which go within the covering membrane, from the tip of each cartilage to the back of the thy- roid cartilage; and the crico arytenoideus poflicus mull flrengthen thefe cords, and the crico arytenoideus lateralis mull relax them. XLVII. The teiyreo arytenoideus, is a mufcle very like the lad one^ and affifts it* It arifes not from

t6 OF THE FORMATION layers, viz. two red layers, and three white ones : Nay, in one experiment he makes the tinge of the madder continue in the bones for fix months, forming fucceflive layers of red and white; although, in an earlier expe- riment (which he mull have forgotten in his hurry), he tells us, that by looking through the tranfparent part of a cock’s wing he had feen the tinge of the mad- der gradually leave the bones in a few days. Thefe experiments are as grofs and palpable as the occafion of them; and fhould Hand as a warning to us, fhowing how feverely and honellly we ought to quef- tion our own judgment, when we aim at confirming our preconceived theories by experiments and fadls. Yet by thefe experiments with madder, one moll important fadt is proved to us; that the arteries and abforbents, adting in concert, alternately depofite and reabforb the earthy particles, as faff as can be con- ceived of the foft parts, or even of the molt moveable and fludluating humours of the body. The abforp- tion of the hardefl bones is proved by daily obferva- tion. When a carious bone difappears before the in- teguments are opened ; when a tumor, prefling upon a bone, deflroys it; when an aneurifm of the tem- poral artery deflroys the fkulT; when an aneurifm of the heart beats open the thorax, deflroying the fler- num and ribs; when an aneurifm of the ham deflroys the thigh-bone, tibia, and joint of the knee ; when a tumour coming from within the head, forces its way through the bones of the fkull;—in all thefe cafes, fince the bone cannot be annihilated, what can hap- pen, but that it muff be abforbed and conveyed away? If we fhould need any ftronger proofs than thefe.

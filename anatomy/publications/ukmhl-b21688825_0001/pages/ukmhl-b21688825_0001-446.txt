402 OF THE MUSCULAR POWER. ]er than the limbs; that the limbs may be propor- tioned to the body : and beauty and conveniency is gained by the facrifice of that power which is not needed in the fyflem, fince the wifdom and goodnefs of the Creator has appointed a degree cf force in the mufcles more than proportioned to all this iofs of the mechanical power. Thofe who will admire the ways of Providence, fhould know how to admire! Nature is not feeking to compenfate for want of power, by the advantages of pulleys, and levers, and mechani- cal helps; nor is it in the forms of the parts that the Infinite Wifdom is to be found j for among other gifts, fuch a portion of this fpirit is given to man that he has ufed the pulleys, and levers, accelerations of motion, and all the mechanical powers that refult from it 5 he has invented valves of infinite variety, each perfect and true to its particular office; he has anticipated all that he has found in the mechanifm of the human body; but the living power which compenfates for the want of levers, which allows every- where power to be facrificed to the beauty of form, which has ftrength in convulfive and violent actions to break the very bones; this is the ad of Infinite Wifdom, on which our admiration fhould chiefly dwell. It is but the very elements of fo deep a fubjed that can be delivered here. I muft proceed to explain thofe provifions for eafy motion, which may be con- fidered as belonging to the mufcles and bones, and as preparing us for a knowledge of the joints. CHAP,

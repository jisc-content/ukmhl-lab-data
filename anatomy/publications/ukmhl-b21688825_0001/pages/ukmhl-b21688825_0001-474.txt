43<3' JOINTS OF THE liable to luxation in proportion as its motions are free and large. Yet the (houlder-joint is not with- out fome kind of defence; its focket is (hallow, but it is guarded by the larged projecting procefles in all the body; by the acromion projecting and drengthen- ing it above; and by the coracoid procefs within; its ligament is lax, eafily torn, and ufeful rather for con- fining the fynovia, and keeping the head of the fhoul- der-bone oppofite to its proper cavity, than in fecu- ring the joint by any drength it has; therefore a li- gament extends from the coracoid to the acromion procefs *, which completes the defences of the joint above, and at its inner fide ; and there comes alfo from the point of the acromion procefs an additional ligament which adheres to the capfule : But the cir- cumdance from which the chief drength of the (houl- der-joint is derived, is the infertion of the four mufcles which come from the (houlder-blade clofe round the head of the bone; fo that they adhere to the cap- fular ligament, pull it up to prevent its being check- ed in the motions of the joint; drengthen it by their thicknefs, for they are fpread upon it: and the con- traction of the mufcles hold the humerus in its place; their total relaxation (as in certain cafes of weaknefs) fuffers the humerus to drop away from the fcapula, without any fall or accident, forming what we are accudomed to call a luxation of the humerus from an internal caufe; and the (houlder cannot be luxated by a fall without fuch violence as tears up thefe mufcles by the roots.

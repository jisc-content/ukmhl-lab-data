> FACE, EYE, AND EAR. 20j dons form that enamelled-like part which lies behind the coloured circle, and which is, from its colour, named the white of the eye, or the tunica albugi- nea, as if it were abfolutely a diftind coat. Now the only difference in thefe ftraight mufcles is in refped of length ; for the optic nerve enters the eye, not regularly in the centre, but a little towards the inner fide, fo that the redus internus, or mufcle neareft the nofe, is a little fhorter. The redus exter- nus, or mufcle neareft to the temple, is a little longer : while the redus fuperior and the rectus inferior are nearly of equal length.

Such is the effed of thefe mufcles, that when they ad in fucceflion, they roll the eye ; but if they ad: all at once, the power of each is balanced by the adion of its oppoftte mufcle, and the eye is immo- vably fixed. So that fometimes in our operations, when' the couching needle approaches the eye, fear comes upon the patient, and the eye is fixed by a convulfive

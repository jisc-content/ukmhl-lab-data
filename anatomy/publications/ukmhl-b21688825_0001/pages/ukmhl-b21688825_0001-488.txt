JOINTS OP THE 444 wards by the fides of the condyles; from this origin it is inferted into all the edge of the rotula, and in fuch a way as to keep the rotula properly without the cavity of the joint; thecapfular ligament going over its inner furface, and lining it with a fmooth and delicate coat. It is fixed below into ail the circle of the head of the tibia, and thus completes its circle, embracing all the bones. This capfule, naturally fo thin and delicate, is made up from all the furrounding parts to a conlider- able thicknefs ; firft, it is covered behind by the heads of the gaftrocnemii; at the Tides by the biceps and other mufcles of the ham-firings ; on its for" part, it is flrengthened by the general fafcia of the thigh, which goes down over the knee, and being there reinforced both by its adhefion to the bones and by the broad expanfion of the vaflus internus, fartorius, biceps, and other mufcles which go out over the patella, it adheres to the capfule, and makes the whole very flrong; be- fxdes which, there is a ligament which, lying in the ham, upon the back part of the capfule, is named, in compliment t o Window,l igamentumposticumWin- slowii. It is a ligament fomewhat refembling the la- teral ligaments of the elbow. It arifes from the outer condyle, goes obliquely acrofs the back part of the joint, adheres to it, and flrengthens it; but often it is not found at all, or in fuch flraggling fibres as cannot be accounted as a ligament. It is manifeft that the knee requires fome fuch additional ligaments behind to ferve as a check, and to prevent its yielding too far. 2. The knee, as being a hinge-joint, has its flronger ligaments at the Tides; and although we fpeak of la- teral

JOINTS OF THE 43 s and In part by that bridge cf ligament which proceeds from the four corner points of the carpal bones. This fheath is lined with a delicate and fofter modification of the common tendinous membrane; is fully bedewed with mucus; and is fairly to be ranked with the burfos mucofae, as it is indeed, like them, a fliut fack. But it is farther croffed in fuch a manner by partitions be- longing to each flexor tendon, that each of them may be faid to have its appropriated burfa mucofa. And thefe burfae, to prevent the bad confequences of fric- tion, are put both betwixt the crofs ligament and the tendons, and alfo betwixt the tendons of the upper- moft mufcle and of the deeper one, and again betwixt the tendons of the fingers and of the thumb. In the fame way the fheaths of the tendons, as they run along the fingers, may be confidered as part of the apparatus of their joints ; for the firft fet of burfae, viz. thofe which lie in the palm of the hand, Hop before they reach the firft joints of the fingers, and then other longitudinal burfae begin from the firft joint of the fin- gers, and go all along them to the laft joint; forming a {heath for the Tendons to run in, which does at once the office of a ftrong ligament, binding them down in their places, and which is fo lubricated on its internal furface as to fave the neceffity of other burfae. Thefe /heaths are thicker in certain points, fo as to form crofs rings of ftrong ligament; ^ but the common /heath and thefe thicker rings ftill form one continual canal: thefe are named the sheaths and annular ligaments, or cross ligaments *, of the fingers, and are of the fame nature with the burfae, Befides thefe, there are * Ligamenta vaginalia, ucamenta cruceata PHALAN- 6UM, &c. no

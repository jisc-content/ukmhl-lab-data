DESCRIPTION OF THE, &C. 53 judge, on which the eyebrows are placed: It is a prominent arched line, correfponding in fize and length with the eyebrow which it fupports. It is the origin of the frontal mufcles. In this line, the integuments adhere very ftrongly, by many arteries which perforate the bone, and which are properly the nutricious arteries of this part of the bone; and we find all over the fuperciliary ridge many fmall holes through which thefe arteries had paffed. Among thefe, there is one hole which is larger, and which is diftinguifhed from the reft ; for its ufe is not like the others to tranfmit arteries to the bone, but to give paffage to a fmall artery which comes out from the or- bit, to mount over the forehead. Sometimes this artery turns freely over the border of the orbit, and makes no mark, or but a flight one : often lying clofer upon the bone, it forms a notch ; but moft commonly, in place of turning fairly over the edge of the orbit, it pafles obliquely through the fuperciliary ridge, and, by perforating the bone, makes a hole, This - hole is named the superciliary hole. The artery which comes from the eye to go out upon the forehead is named, where it paffes the ridge, the fuperciliary ar- tery ; and higher up upon the forehead, the frontal artery. It eftablifhes a communication betwixt the internal arteries of the eye, and the external arteries of the forehead and temple ; and it carries along with it a fmall nerve from the eye, which, going alfo out upon the forehead, is named the fuperciliary or frontal nerve. We are always warned of the danger of wounding arteries where they pafs through bones ; and ftrange ftories are told of the terrible bleedings e 3 which

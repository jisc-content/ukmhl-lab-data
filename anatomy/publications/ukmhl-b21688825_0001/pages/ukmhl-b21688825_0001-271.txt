LOWER. JAW, THROAT, ARD TONGUE. 22y The pharynx, which is the opening of the gullet, that it may receive freely the morfel of food, is ex- panded into a large and capacious bag, which hangs from the bafis of the fkull, is chiefly attached to the occipital bone, the pterygoid procefles, and the back parts of either jaw-bone. TLhe oefophagus, again, is the tube which conveys the food down into the fto- mach; and this bag of the pharynx is the expanded or trumpet-like end of it; or it may be compared with the mouth of a funnel. Towards the mouth, the pha- rynx is bounded by the root of the tongue and by the arches of the throat; behind, it lies flat and fmooth along the bodies of the vertebrae ; before, it is protected, and in fome degree furrounded, by the great carti- lages of the larynx ; the horns of the os hyoides em- brace its fides, and it is covered with flat mufcular fibres, which, arifmg from the os hyoides and cartilages of the throat, go round the pharynx, in fair and regu-i lar orders, and are named its conftrictors, beeaufe they embrace it clofely, and their contractions force down the food. LIII. The stylo-pharyngeus, arifes from the root of the ftyloid procefs. It is a long, Render, and beau- tiful mufcle ; it expands fleflry upon the fide of the pha- rynx ; extends fo far as to take a hold upon the edge of the thyroid cartilage ; it lifts the pharynx up to re- ceive the morfel, and then firaitens and comprefles the bag, to pulh the morfel down, and by its hold upon the thyroid cartilage it commands the larynx alfo, and the whole throati The pharynx being furrounded by many irregular points of bone, its circular fibres or conftri&ors have q 2 many

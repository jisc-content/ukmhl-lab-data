66 DESCRIPTION OF fHTE Â©f pars petrofa and pars fquamofa. The whole bone is very irregular in its thicknefs, and hollows, and proceffes. The Pars squamosa is a thin or fcaly part; rifes like a fhell over the lower part of the pa- rietal bone, and is fmoothed and flattened by the rub- ing of the temporal mufcle. The pars petrosa? often named os lapidosum, or ftony bone, is hard, ir- regular, rocky 5 juts inward towards the bafis of the fkull ; contains the organ of hearing, and, of courfe^ receives and tranfmits all the nerves which are con- nected with the ear. There is a third portion of this bone, viz. the occipital angle, which is thick and hard; is divided into cells, and forms thofe caverns which are fuppofed to be chiefly ufeful in reverbe- rating the found. The fquamous part is grooved, to make the fqua-- mous future ; is fco! loped or fringed ; and exceeding- ly thin on its edge ; it is radiated, in confequence of its original edification fhooting out in rays. The petrous part again is triangular, unequal by the ca- vities of the ear ; it has a very hard, fhining, polifhed- like furface 5 exceeded in hardnefs by nothing but the enamel of the teeth. Where it projects into the bife, it has feveral open points, which are filled up with cartilaginous or ligamentous fubflance ; and its occi- .pital angle is connected with the other bones by the additamentum futurae fquamofae. Processes, i. The zygomatic process riles broad and flat before the ear; grows gradually fmaller as it flretches forward to reach the cheek bone : forms with a procefs of that bone the zygoma, yoke, or arch of the te.mple, under which the temporal mufcle plays.

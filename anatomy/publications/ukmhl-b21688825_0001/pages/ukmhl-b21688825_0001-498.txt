JOINTS OF THE 45 4 the acute point of the inner ankle, expands in a ra- diated form upon the general capfule; adheres to it, and ftrengthens it, and is fixed all along the fides of the aftragalus: This ligament coming from one point, and expanding to be inferted into a long line, has a tri- angular form, whence it is named ligamentum del- Toides ; and while the general ligament fecures the joint towards that fide, the oblique fibres of its fore edge prevent the foot being too much extended, as in leaping; and its oblique fibres on the back edge prevent its being too much bended, as in climbing ; but the li- gaments of the outer ankle, tying it to the other fide of the aftragulus, are indeed diftinci, mne going for- wards, one going backwards, and one running directly downwards ; one goes from the point or knob of the fibula, obliquely downwards and forwards, to be infert- ed into the fide of the aftragalus : it is fquare and flat, of confiderable breadth and ftrength, and is called liga- mentum fibulfe anterius. Another ligament goes perpendicularly downwards, from the acute point of the cuter ankle, to fpread upon the fide of the aftra- galiis and of the capfule, and is finally inferted into the heel-bone; this is named the ligamentum fibulas ferpendiculare. A third ligament goes out ftill from the fame point,, to go backwards over the back part of the capfule ; adheres to the back of the capfule, and ftrengthens it, and is named ligamentum inter fibulam et astragalum, posterius. There is nothing very particularly worthy of notice in the ankle-joint; for it is covered with cartilages; lined with a foft and mucous membrane ; and lubricated with mucous fimbriae and maffes of fat, fuch as are found m

OF THE TS-UNS.' . *127 marks are eafily obferved ; the appex, or point of the triangle, is pointed downwards, to meet the fecond bone of the fternum : The base of the triangle, which is uppermoft, towards the root of the throat feems a little hollowed, for the trachea paffing behind it: On each upper corner, it has a large articulating hollow, into which the ends of the collar bones are re- ceived ; (for this bone is the fteady fulcrum upon which they roll). A little lower than this, and upon its fide, is the focket for receiving the fhort cartilage of the firft rib; and the fecond rib is implanted in the interface between the firft and fecond bone of the fternum ; fo that one half of the focket for its cartilage is found in the lower part of this bone, and the other half in the upper end of the next. 2. The fecond piece of the fternum is of a fquare form ; very long and flat; and compofmg the chief length of the fternum: for the firft piece receives only the cartilage of the firft rib, and one half of the fecond; but this long piece receives, on each fide cr edge of it, the cartilages of eight ribs; but as three of the lower cartilages are run into one, there are but five fockets or marks. The fockets for re- ceiving the cartilages of the ribs are on the edges of the fternum 5 they are very deep in the firm fubftance of the bone, and large enough to receive the point of the finger with eafe : And whoever compares the fize and deepnefs of thefe fockets, with the round heads of the cartilages 'which enter into them, will no more doubt of diftlnd joints here, than of the diftinct arti- culation of the vertebras with each other. 3. This is in truth the whole of the bony fternum ; and wrhat is reckoned the third piece, is a carti- lage

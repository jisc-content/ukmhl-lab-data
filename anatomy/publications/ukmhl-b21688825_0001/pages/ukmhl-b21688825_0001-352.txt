308 muscles of the trunk. * cefophagus, trachea, and great veflfels, flat upon the fore part of the vertebra ; and this is the firft and longeft. Although this be called rectus, it is oblique, and runs rather on one fide ; for it arifes from the tranfverfe procefles of the five lower vertebrae of the neck, and is inferted into the cuneiform procefles of the occipital bone, juft before the foramen magnum. CXXXIX. Rectus internus minor. This is an exceedingly fmall mufcle ; refembles the obliquus pof- terior of the head. It lies immediately under the rec- tus major : It arifes from the fore part of the body of the firft vertebra, the atlas ; and going (like the other reflus) obliquely inwards, it is inferted into the occi- pital bone near the condyle. CXL. And the recus capitis lateralis is an- other fmall mufcle like the former ; which arifes from the tranfverfe procefles of the firft vertebra, and is in- ferted into the fide of the cuneiform procefs of the oc- cipital bone. It lies immediately under the exit of the great jugular vein. CXLI. Longus colli. This is the chief of thofe mufcles which lie upon the fore part of the neck; it is very long, arifing from the flat internal furface of the vertebra of the back to go up along thofe of the neck. Its origin is firft within the thorax, from the three uppermoft vertebra of the back, from the flat part of their bodies, and then from all the tranfverfe pro- cefles of the neck except the three upper ones. It is inferted tendinous into the fore part of the fecond vertebra 7

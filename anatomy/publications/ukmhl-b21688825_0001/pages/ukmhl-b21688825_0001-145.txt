IOI OF THE FACE AND JAWS. H 3 5. The len part is raifed. Such fractures happen from blows or falls ; but not by pulling teeth, for the fockets of the teeth bear but a fmall proportion to the reft of the jaw ; even in children this cannot happen, for in them the teeth have no roots, and have no hold nor dangerous power over the jaw. Though (as I have faid) the fockets often fuffer, the jaw itfelf never yields. 3. The angle of the jaw, is that corner where the bafe of the jaw ends, where the bone rifes upwards, at right angles, to be articulated with the head. This part alfo is eaftly felt, and by it we judge well of the fttuation of veins, arteries, and glands, which might be in danger of being cut, in wounds, or in operations. There are two proceffes of the jaw, of particular im- portance, the coronoid or horn like procefs, for the in- fertion of its ftrong mufcles, efpecially of the temporal mufcle, and the condyloid or hinge procefs, by which it is jointed with the temporal bone. 4. The coronoid process, named from its refem- blance to a horn, is, like the reft of the jaw-bone, flat on its Tides, and turned up with an acute angle, very fharp at its point, and lying exactly under the zygoma, or temporal arch. The temporal mufcle runs under this arch, and lays hold on the coronoid procefs ; not touching it on one point only, but grafping it on every fide, and all round. And the procefs is fet fo far before the articulation of the jaw, that it gives the mufcle great power. This procefs is fo defended by the temporal arch, and fo covered by mufcles, that it cannot be felt without.

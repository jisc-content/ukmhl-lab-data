252 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. long head it may aflift alfo to bend the fhoulder out- wards and backwards. Befides bones, there is alfo another fource of attach- ment for mufcles, that is, the tendinous expanfions: for the expanfions, which go on the furface like {heaths, alfo dive betwixt the mufcles, and form fepta or partitions, from which their fibres arife. One tendinous expanfion begins from the clavicle and acromion procefs, or rather comes down from the neck ; it is then ftrengthened by the tendon of the deltoid mufcle ; it defcends, covering all the arm ; and before it goes down over the fore-arm, it is again re- inforced chiefly by the biceps, but alfo by the tendon of the extenfor triceps. One remarkable procefs or partition of this general fafcia is fent in from the fh'eath to be fixed to the outfide of the humerus, all the way down to the ridge of the outer condyle. Another partition goes down, in like manner, to the inner con- dyle, along the ridge which leads to it; then the faf- cia, taking a firm hold on the condyles, is greatly ftrengthened about the elbow, and goes over the fore- arm, inclofing its mufcles in a very firm and ciofe fheath ; and it fends partitions down among the feve- ral layers of mufcles in the fore-arm, which gives each of them a firm hold. LXXXI. The anconeus is a frnall triangular muf- cle, placed on the back part of the elbow. It arifes from the ridge and from the external condyle of the hume- rus, by a thick, ftrong, and fhort tendon. From this it becomes flefhy ; and after running about three inches obliquely backwards, it is inferted by its oblique flefhy fibres into the back part or ridge of the ulna. It

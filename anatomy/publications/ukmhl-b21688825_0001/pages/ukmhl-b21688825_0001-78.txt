34 of tKe formation, &c. itfelf. If we pierce the bone of any animal, and de- ftroy the marrow, the old bone dies, and a new one is formed from the periofteum : if we kill the creature foon, we find the new bone to be a mere fecretion from the inner furface to the periofteum ; and if we wait the completion of the procefs, we find the new bone beautiful, white, eafily injected, and thick, loofe in its texture, and vafcular and bloody, but ftill firm enough for the animal to walk upon ; and in the heart of it, we find the old bone dead and black. If we reverfe this operation, and deftroy the periofteum only, leaving the nutritious veffels entire, then the new bone is formed frelh and vafcular by the medul- lary veffels, and the old one furrounds it quite black and dead; and in fraftures of the patella, or knee-pan, where there are no medullary veffels, the pieces are united by a callus, which is fecreted from the veffels of the bone itfelf. The difeafes of the bones are the moft frequent in furgery ; and it is impoffible to exprefs how much the furgeon is concerned in obtaining true ideas of the ftrucfcure, conftitution, and difeafes of bones ; how te- dious, how painful, and how Ioathfome thefe difeafes are ; how often the patient muft lofe his limb, or en- danger his life; how very ufeful art is; but, above all, what wonders nature daily performs in recovering bones from their difeafed ftate.

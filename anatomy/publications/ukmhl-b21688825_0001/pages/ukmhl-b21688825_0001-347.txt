There i^ a great mafs lying all along the hollow of the back, on each fide of the fpinous procefles, which paffing alternately from the tranfverfe procefs of one vertebra to the fpinous procefs of the next above, is of courfe fplit into many heads, but yet hav- ing fuch connexion as to give it the form and name of a fmgle mufcle, the multifidus spin^e. 4. and 5. There are yet fmaller mufcular fafciculi, which hand perpendicularly betwixt every two trani- verfe and every two fpinous procefles ; thence they are named intertransversarii and inter-spinales. CXXX. The spinalis cervicis is that which is implanted into the fpines of the cervical vertebrae ; but becaufe it does not go from fpine to fpine, like the fpinalis dorfi, but from tranverfe procefles to fpines, it has been named by Winflow semi-spinalis, or transverso-spinalis colli. It arifes from the tranfverfe procefles of the fix upper vertebrae of the back, and is inferted into all the fpinous procefles of the vertebrae of the neck except the firlt and laft ; and it extends the neck, or by its obliquity, may contri- bute to the turnings of the neck, or to bending it to one fide CXXXI. The spinalis dorsi arifes from two fpi- nous procefles of the loins, and from the three lower fpines of the back; and pafling two fpines untouch- ed, it is implanted into all the fpines of the back ex- * The transversalis cervicis (vide p. 301.) is that which goes from the tranfverfe procefles of the back to the tranfverfe pro- cefles of the neck ; while this, the spinalis cervicis, goes from the tranfverfe procefles of the back to the fpines of the neck. cept

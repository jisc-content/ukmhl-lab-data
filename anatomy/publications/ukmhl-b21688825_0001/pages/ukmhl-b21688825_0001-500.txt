JOINTS OF THE 4 56 carpal bones, the feverai ranks are tied one to- another by crofs ligaments, yhich pafs from the root of one bone to the root of the next. We have ligaments of the fame defcription and ufe, holding the metatarfai bones together, both on the upper and on the lower furface of the foot; and all the ligaments of the foot are of great ftrength and thicknefs. The lower ends of the metatarfai bones have alfo tranfverfe ligaments by which they are tied to each other. The toes have hinge-joints, formed by capfules, and fecured by latej ral ligaments, as thofe of the fingers are ; and except in the ftrength or number of ligaments, the joinings of the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers, exactly refemble the joinings of the tarfus, metatarfus, and toes. But thefe ligaments, though helping to join the in- dividual bones, could not have much effect in fupport- i'ng the whole arch of the foot. It is further fecured by a great ligament, which extends in owe triangular and flat plate from the point of the heel to the roots of each toe. This is named the aponeurosis plan- tarts pedis ; which is not merely am aponeurofis for cevering, defending, and fupporting, the mufcles of the foot; that might have been done on eafier terms with a fafcia, very flight compared with this ; but the chief ufe of the plantar aponeurofis is to fupport the arch of the foot. It paffes from point to point, like the bow-ftring betwixt the two horns of a bow, and, after leaping or hard walking, it is in the foie of the foot that we feel the {training and pain ; fo that, like the palmar aponeurofis, it fupports the arch, gives ori- gin to the ftiort mufcles of the toes, braces them in their addon, and makes bridges under which the long tendons

AND GROWTH OF BONES. 9 when the offifying cartilage is cut into thin flices, and fteeped in water till its arteries rot, the nucleus of of- fification drops fpontaneoufly from the cartilage, leav- ing the cartilage like a ring, with a fmooth and regular hole where the bone lay. The colour of each part of a bone is proportioned exa&ly to the degree in which its offification has advan- ced. When offification begins in the centre of the bone, rednefs alfo appears ; indicating the prefence of thofe veffels by which the bony matter is to be poured out. When the bony matter begins to accumulate, the red colour of thofe arteries is obfcured, the centre of the bone becomes yellow or white, and the colour feems to be removed towards the ends of the bone. In the centre, the firfl: colouring of the bone is a cloudy, diffufed and general red, becaufe the veffels are pro- fufe. Beyond that, at the edges of the firfl: circle, the veffels are more fcattered, and diftindl trunks are ea- fily feen, forming a circle of radiating arteries, which point towards the heads of the bone. Beyond that, again, the cartilage is tranfparent and pure, being yet untouched with blood; the arteries have not reached it, and its offification is not begun. Thus, a long bone, while forming, feems to be divided into feven 'varioufly coloured zones. The central point of moll perfect offification is yellow and'opaque. On either fide of that, there is a zone of red. On either fide of that again, the veffels being more fcattered, form a vafcular zone*, and the zone at either end is tranfpa- rent ^ It is curious to obferve how completely vafcular the bone of 3 chicken is before the offification have fairly begun j how the of- fification

26l MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. from the upper part of the radius, at the lharp ridge. By thefe origins it becomes very flelhy and thick; and a little above the middle of the fore-arm divides into four flelhy portions, each of which ends in a fiender tendon. The tendons begin at the middle of the fore-arm or near the divifion; but they continue to be joined to each other by flelhy fibres fome way down: and indeed the flelhy fibres ceafe only when it is about to pafs under the annular ligament of the wrift. At this place a cellular ftringy tiflue connedls the tendons with each other, and with the tendons of the profundus; but after they have pafled under the ligament, they expand towards the fingers which they are to ferve. They each begin to be extended and flattened, and to become thinner; they begin to ap- pear cleft; they pafs by the edge of the metacarpal bones, and efcape from under the palmar aponeurofis: and where it ends, viz. at the root of the fingers, a tendinous Iheath or burfa begins, in which thefe ten- dons continue to be inclofed. The tendons are fairly fplit juft oppofite to the top of the firfl: phalanx: and it is at this point that the tendons of the deeper mufcle pafs through this fplit- ting. The flattened tendon parts into two, and its oppofite edges diverge; the back edges meet behind the tendons of the profundus, and form a kind of Iheath for them to pafs in ; and then they proceed forward along the fecond phalanx, into the fore-part of which they are implanted. This mufcle is exceedingly ftrong. Its chief office is to bend the fecond joint of the fingers upon the firfl:, and the firfl; upon the metacarpal bone. And in

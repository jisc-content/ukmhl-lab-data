INDIVIDUAL BONES OF THE SKULL. from above downwards, erodes the firft ridges, and makes a crofs called the crucial spine ; and in a ftrong man advanced in years, where the ridges and hollows are ftrongly marked, the point where thefe ridges crofs, is fo very prominent, as to be named the posterior tuberosity of the occipital bone. The internal surface. Oppofite to thefe ridges, there are fimilar crucial ridges within; but more regu- lar, fmooth, and equal, and making only one tranfverfe line. The tentorium cerebello-super-extensum, is a diaphragm or tranfverfe partition, which erodes the ikull at its back part; cuts oft from the reft; of the cranium the hollow of the occipital bone ; appropriates that cavity for the cerebellum, and defends the cere- bellum from the weight and predure of the brain. This tentorium, or tranfverfe membrane, is attached to the great internal ridge of the occipital bone. In the angle where this membrane is fixed to the ridge, lies the great fimus or vein ; which is called lon- gitudinal finus, while it is running along the head; but the fame finus, dividing in the back of the head, into two great branches, changes its name with its direction ; and the forkings of the vedel are named the right and left lateral finufes, which go down through the bafis of the Ikull; and being continued down the neck, are there named the great or internal jugular veins. This forking of the longitudinal, into the lateral finufes, makes a triangular or tripod-like groove, which follows the internal ridges of the occipital bone : and above and below the tranfverfe ridge, there are formed four plain and fmooth hollows. The two upper ones are above the tentorium, and contain the back- mod

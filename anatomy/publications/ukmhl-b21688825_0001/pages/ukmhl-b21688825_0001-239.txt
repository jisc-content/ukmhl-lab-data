195 FACE, EYE, AND EAR. this eroding as a meeting of fibres from the upper and from the lower mufcle, have defcribed it as two femi- circular mufcles. And thofe fibres w'hich are next to the tarfus or cartilaginous circle of the eyelids, were diltinguilhed by Rioland under the title of musculus ciliaris. Our name exprefles the common opinion, that it is a circular mufcle, whofe chief point or ful- crum is in the inner corner of the eye, and which fierves as a fphinder for doling the eye. It fqueezes with fpafmodic violence when the eye is injured, as by dull. And by its drawing down the eyelids fo firmly, it prefles the ball of the eye down into the focket, and forces the lachrymal gland that is within the focket, fo as to procure a How of tears. Perhaps the corru- gator fupercilii belongs ftri&ly to this mufcle, fmce its fibres follow the fame courfe. IV. Levator palpebr.® superioris.—This fmall mufcle arifes deep within the focket, from the margin of that hole which gives palfage to the optic nerve. It begins by a fmall flat tendon in the bottom of the optic cavity; becomes gradually broader as it goes over the eyeball; it ends in the eyelid by a broad expanfion of mufcular fibres, which finally terminate in a Ihort flat tendon. It lies under the orbicularis palpebrse ; is inferted into the whole length of Lhe car- tilage of the tarfus; and raifes and opens the upper eyelid. And the divifion of the orbicularis oculi into two, by the older anatomifts, was a confequence of their not knowing of the true levator palpebres, and their not being able to defcribe any mufcle by which the upper eyelid could be raifed, except the upper half of the orbicularis.

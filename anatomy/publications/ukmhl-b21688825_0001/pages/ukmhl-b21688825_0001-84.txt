40 OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL, its proceffes form the back of the noftrils and roof of the mouth ; and it is fo placed ; as to fupport the very centre of the brain, and tranfmit almoft all its nerves, SUTURES.â€”All thefe bones are joined together by feams, which, from their indented, or dove-tailed ap- pearance, are named futures. 1. The coronal suture, is that which joins the frontal to the parietal bones; extends almoft directly acrofs the head, from ear to ear ; defcends behind the eye, into the deep part of the temple ; and there lo- fing its ferrated appearance, becomes like the fquamous or fcaly future, which joins the temporal bones. It is , named coronal, becaufe the ancients wore their gar- lands on this part of the head. But the future had been better entitled to this name, had it furrounded the head, than as it croffes it. 2. The lambdoidal suture, is that which joins the parietals, to the occipital bone. It begins behind the one ear, afcends, and arches over the occiput, and defcends behind the other ear. It thus ftrides over the occiput, in a form fomewhat refembling the letter lambda (A) of the Greeks ; whence its name. 3. The sagittal suture, joins the parietal bones to each other j runs on the very top of the head ; extends forwards from the lambdoidal future, till it touches, or fometimes paffes, the coronal future ; and from lying betwixt thefe two futures, like an arrow betwixt the firing and the bow, it has been named fagittal. 4. The temporal sutures, join the temporal bones to the parietal, occipital, and frontal bones ; the fphe- noid bone alfo enters into the temporal future, juft behind the eye. The temporal future makes an arch correfpond-

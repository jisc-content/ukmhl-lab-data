MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 243 it is clofely connected with this head almofi in its whole length: it is fmall at its beginning ; it grows gradually thicker as it defcends; it is all flefhy, and is inferted by a very Ihort tendon into the os humeri, nearly about its middle, betwixt the brachialis and the third head of the triceps. It is perforated by the mufculo-cuta- neous nerve. This was obferved by Cafferius, an Italian anatomift; and the mufcle is often named, MUSCULUS PERFORATUS CASSERII. Its action is very fimple, to raife the arm obliquely forwards and upwards, and confequently to give a de- gree of rotation. It will alfo have a chief effect in pulling the arm towards the fide. LXXIII. The supra spinatus, is fo named from its occupying the hollow of the fcapula above the fpine. It arffes from the back of the fcapula, from the fpine, and from the edge or cofta; it is exceedingly thick and flelhy, filling up all the hollow; and it is firmly inclofed in this triangular hollow by a ftrong tendinous expanfion, which paffes from the edge of the fcapula to the ridge of the fpine. It is confequently a mufcle of a triangular figure, thick and ftrong; it paffes under the acromion, and degenerates into a ten- don there; and going under the acromion, as under an arch, and over the ball of the humerus, it adheres to the capfule of the lhoulder-joint, and is at laft implanted by a broad ftrong tendon into the great tuberofity on the head of the bone. It is evidently defigned for railing the humerus di- rectly upwards; and by its attachment to the capfule, the capfule is drawn up when the arm is raffed ; fo that, though lax, it cannot be catched in the joint.

266 MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. is tendinous, and joins near the top of that origin which comes from the radius. It becomes tendinous very high, i. e. above the middle of the arm; and its" fmall tendon paifes under the annular ligament, glides in the hollow of the os metacarpi pollicis, and feparates the ftiort flexor into two heads; paffes betwixt the two fefamoid bones in the firfl joint of the thumb, and running in the tendi- nous {heath, it reaches at laft the end of the fartheft bone, to be inferted into the very point of it. There is fometimes fent off from the lower part of the mufcle a fmall fieihy flip, which joins its tendon to the indicator tendon of the fublimis. Its ufes, we conje&ure, are exactly as of thofe of the other flexors, to bend the laft phalanx on the firfl, the firfl on the metacarpal bones, and occafionally the wrift upon the radius and ulna, XCI. The pronator quadratus, fo named from its Ihape and form, is one of the moft Ample in its ac- tion, fince it ferves but one dired purpofe, viz. turning the radius upon the ulna. It lies flat upon the interoffeous ligament, upon the fore-part of the arm, about two inches above the wrift ; it is nearly fquare, and is about three inches in length and breadth. Its fibres go obliquely acrofs, betwixt 1 the radius and ulna. It arifes from the edge of the ulna, adheres to the interofleous ligament, and goes to be implanted into the edge of the radius. It turns the radius upon the ulna; and this mufcle, and in fome degree alfo the flexor pollicis, are the only mufcles whicfl do not come fairly under that arrangement by yhich

SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. 1J1 the 7. This high point is named the acromion pro- cess. It is the continuation and ending of the fpine, which at hrPc rifes perpendicularly from the bone, but by a fort of turn or diftortion it lays its flat fide to- wards the head of the fhoulder-bone. At this place, it is thickened, flat and ftrong ; overhangs and defends the joint; and is not merely a defence, but almoU makes a part of the joint itfelf ; for without this pro- cefs, the lhoulder-bone could not remain a moment in Its focket; every flight accident would difplace it. The acromion prevents luxation upwards, and is fo far a part of the joint, that when it is full under the acromion, the joint is fafe ; but when we feel a hollow, fo that we can pulh the points of the fingers under the acromion procefs, the fnoulder is luxated, and the focket empty. The point of the acromion, forming the apex of the fhoulder, a greater projection of this point, and a fulnefs of the deltoid mufcle which arifes from it, is a chief caufe, and of courfe a chief mark, of fupe- rior llrength. 8. But there is flill another fecurity for the joint; for there arifes from the neck of the fcapula, almofl from the border of the focket, and its inner fide, a thick, fhort, and crooked procefs, which Hands direct- ly forwards, and is yery confpicuous ; and which turn- ing forwards v/ith a crooked and fharp point, fome- what like the be|k of a crow, is thence named the coracoid process. This alfo guards and flrengthens the joint; though it cannot altogether prevent luxa- tions, it makes them lefs frequent; and mod probably When the arm is luxated inwards, it is by karting over

OF THE BONES 96 3. The nasal PLATEor process,is a thin andfmglA plate ; rifes perpendicularly upwards from the palate ; lies upon the fide and back part of the noltrils, fo as to form their opening backwards into the throat; it is fo joined to the upper jaw-bone, that it lies there like a founding-board upon the fide of the antrum Highmo- rianum, and completes that cavity forming the thin partition betwixt it and the nofe. 4Â« This nafal procefs extends thus up from the back arch of the palate to the back part of the orbit; and though the nafal plate is very thin and delicate in its whole le'ngth, yet, where it enters into the orbit, it is enlarged into an irregular kind of knob of a trian* gular form. This knob is named its orbit ary pro- cess ; or, as the knob has two faces looking two ways in the orbit, it is divided fometimes (as by Monro the father) into two orbitary procelfes, the anterior and poflerior; the anterior one is the chief. This orbitary procefs, or point of the palate bone, being triangular, very fmall, and very deep in the focket, is not eafdy difcovered in the entire fkull. 5. This orbitary procefs is molt commonly hollow or cellular, and its cells are fo joined to thofe of the fphenoid bone, that it is the palate bone that (huts the fphenoid cells, and the fphenoid and palatine cells of each fide conftitute but one general cavity. The OSSA SPONGIOSA, or TURBINATA, IN- FERIOR A, are fo named, to diftinguilh them from the upper fpongy bones, which belong to the bs aeth- moides) but thefe lower fpongy bones are quite dif- tin&,

24 OP THE FORMATION the middle of the bone; more thin and ferous for- wards the fpongy ends. The whole mafs, when fha- ken out of the bone, is like a bunch of grapes, each hanging by its (talk. The globules, when feen with the microfcope, are neat, round, and white, feeming like fmall pearls, and each ftalk is feen to be a fmall artery, which comes along the membrane of the can- celli, fpreads its branches beautifully on the furface of the bag, and ferves to fecrete the marrow, each fmall twig of artery filling its peculiar cell. To this, an old anatomift added, that they had their contractile power, like the urinary bladder, for expelling their contents ; that they fqueezed their marrow, by channels of com- munication, through and among the bony layers; and that their oil exuded into the joint, by nearly the fame mechanifm by which it got into the fubftance of the bone. a" While the conftitution of a bone was not at all un- derflood, anatomifls noted with particular care,^every trifling peculiarity, in the forms or connections of its parts, and thefe lamellae attracted particular notice. That a bone is formed in fuccefiive plates, is eafily feen, as in whalebone; or in the horns and bones of the larger animals; in church-yard bones, which have been long buried, or long expofed to the air. It is demonftrated by a careful picking, and repa- ration of the fcales, in a young bone, or by burn- ing a bone, which melts and confumes its gelly, and leaves the bony parts entire. It is feen in the com- mon difeafes of bones; for they call off by fucceffive plates, or leaves, whence the procefs is named ex- foliation ; and one plate is thoroughly fpoiled and caft

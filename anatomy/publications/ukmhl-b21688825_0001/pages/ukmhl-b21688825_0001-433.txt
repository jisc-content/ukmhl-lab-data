OF THE MUSCULAR POWER* 389 of Goerter, the ofcillation of Boerhaave, and the tonic power of Stahl. It is feen in the fpontaneous and tre- mulous contractions of mufcles when lacerated, as' in wounds; when cut in operations; when entirely fe- parated from the body, as in experiments upon ani- mals ; like that tremulous motion which we often feel in various parts of the body, without any evident caufe, and independent of the will. Even when the body is dead to all appearance, and the nervous power gone, this contractile power remains ; fo that if a body be placed in certain attitudes before it be cold, its mufcles will contract, and it will be fixed in that pofture till the organization yields and begins to be diffolved. It is by this inherent power that a cut muf- cle contracts and leaves a gap ; that a cut artery fhrinks and retires into the flefh ; that the whole body fhrinks and grows fuff after death. Thefe are but faint indica- tions of that latent power which can be eafily excited to the mofc violent motions, and on which all the ftrength of the mufcles depends : For the ligaments, tendons, burfse of joints, and all thofe parts which have no living power, are capable of bearing the fame weight when dead as when alive. But fuch is the connection betwixt the organization of a mufcle and its contraCtile power, that the moment it dies all its power is gone ; and the mufcle which could lift a hundred pounds while alive, cannot bear the weight of a few pounds when dead. This latent power may be brought into full aCtion by various ftimuli. The latent power itfelf is called vis infita; the acting power put into aCtion, or the proof of the vis infita, upon ap- plying ftimuli, is called the irritability of mufcles. This c c 3 irritability

OF THE FORMATION 2 fo return to that point, as to reprefent truly this con- fent of fun&ions, and connexion of parts, by which it is compofed into one perfect whole. The bones are framed as a bafis for the whole fyf- tem; fitted to fupport, defend, and contain the more delicate and noble organs. They are the moft perma- nent and unchangeable of all parts of the body. We fee them expofed to the feafons, without fullering the fmalleft change ; remaining for ages the memorials of the dead; the evidence of a former race of men ex- ceeding ours in firength and ftature ; the only remains of creatures which no longer exift; the proofs of fuch changes on our globe, as we cannot trace but by thefe uncertain marks. Thus we are apt to conceive, that even in the living body, bones are hardly organized; fcarcely partaking of life; not liable, like the foft parts, to difeafe and death. But minute anatomy, the moll pleafing part of our fcience, unfolds and explains to us the internal ftructure of the bones; {hows their myriads of veflels; and proves them to be as full of blood as the moft fucculent and flelhy parts; having, like them, their periods of growth and decay; being as liable to accidents, and as fubjeft to internal difeafe. The phenomena of fractured bones firft fuggefted fome indiftindt notions of the way in which bone might be formed. It was obferved, that in very aged men, a hard cruft was often formed upon the furface of the bones; that the fluid exuding into the joints of gouty people, fometimes coagulated into a chalky mafs; Le Dran had feen in a cafe of fpina ventofa, or fcrophulous bone, an exudation which flowed out like wax, and hardened into perfect bone; Daventer had

JOINTS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE. 425 ynatic procefs, and the condyle (landing upon the higheft ridge, is the dangerous pofition in which luxa- tion is mod eafily produced. To render thefe motions very eafy and free, a moveable cartilage is interpofed. We find fuch carti- lages in the joints of the clavicle, wrift, knee, and jaw, becaufe the motions are continual and rapid, The moveable cartilage is thin in its centre, and thicker to-? wards its edges, by which it rather deepens than fills up the hollow of the joint. It correfponds in (hape with the head or condyle of the jaw, and with the hollow of the temporal bone. It moves with every motion of the jaw, facilitates the common motions, and pre- vents luxation ; but the joint is ftill more firongly fe- cured by the (Irength of its pterygoid and temporal mufcles, which are inferted clofe round the joint, than by any (Irength of its capfule. It is the mufcles which prevent luxation ; and it is their adtion alfo that makes It xation, when it has happened, fo difficult to reduce, RIBS. The ribs have two joints, and a hinge-like motion, rifing and falling alternately as we draw in or let out the breath. The two joints of the ribs are thus fe- cured : Firft, the proper head of the ribs being hinged upon the intervertebral fubftance, and touching two vertebrae, it is tied to the bodies of each by a regular capfule : the bag is regular, is lubicrated within, and is as perfedt as any joint in the body; it is radiated without, fo as to expand pretty broad upon the fides of the vertebrae, and has a fort of divifion as if into two fafciculi; the one belonging to the vertebra above, the

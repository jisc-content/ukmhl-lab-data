SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND, l6? m 4 by Vera! layers of mufcular flefh, fo that it lies flat, and glides upon the trunk. The scapula is a thin bone ; which has originally, like the Ikull, two tables ; and an intermediate diploe ; but by preflure, and the action of its own mufcles, it grows gradually thinner ; its tables are more and more condenfed; till in old age it has become perfectly tranf- parent, and is fupported only by its procefles, and by its thicker edges. For its spine is a ridge of firm and ftrong bone, which rifes very high, and gives a broad origin and fupport for its mufcles : The acromion in which the fpine terminates, is a broad and flat procefs, a fure guard for the joint of the fhoulder : The cora- coid procefs is a ftrong but fhorter procefs, which Hands out from the neck of the bone ; and the costa, or bor- ders of the bone are alfo rounded, hrm, and ftrong: So that the procefles and borders fupport the flat part of the bone, which is as thin as a fheet of paper, and quite tranfparent. There is no part nor procefs of the fcapula which does not require to be very carefully marked; for no accidents are more frequent than luxations of the fhoulder ; and the various luxations are explained belt by fludying in the fkeleton, and being able to recog- nize on the living body all the procefles and projecting points. i. The flat side of the fcapula is fmooth, fomewhat concave, and fuited to the convexity of the ribs. The fcapula is connected with no bone of the trunk ; tied by no ligaments j is merely laid upon the chefl, with a large mafs of mufcular flefh under it, upon which it glides j fo? there are below it two layers of mufcles,

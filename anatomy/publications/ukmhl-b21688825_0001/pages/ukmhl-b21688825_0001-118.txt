74 DESCRIPTION OF THE this fenfe very greatly, and are named fpongy bones. Another fiat plate lies in the orbit of the eye; and being very fmooth by the rolling of the eye, it is named the os planum, or fmooth bone. So that the sethmoid bone fupports the fore part of the brain, receives the olfactory nerves, forms the organ of fuelling, and makes a chief part of the orbit of the eye ; and the fpongy bones, and the os planum, are neither of them diftindt bones, but parts of this eethmoid bone. The cribriform plate is exceedingly delicate and thin ; lies horizontally over the root of the nofe; and fills up neatly the fpace betwixt the two orbitary plates of the frontal bone. The olfadtory nerves, like two fmall flat lobes, lie out upon this plate, and adhering to it, Ihoot down like many roots through this bone, fo as to perforate it with numerous fmall holes, as if it had been dotted with the point of a pin, or like a nut- meg grater. This plate is horizontal; but its procefles are per- pendicular, one above, and three below. 1. The firfl: perpendicular procefs is what is called c rista galli ; a fmall perpendicular projection, fome- what like a cockâ€™s comb, but exceedingly fmall, Hand- ing directly upwards from the middle of the cribriform plate, and dividing that plate into two; fo that one ol- fadtory nerve lies upon each fide of the crilta galli; and the root of the falx or fepteyn betwixt the two hemi- fpheres of the brain, begins from this procefs. The fora- men csecum, or blind hole of the frontal bone, is form- ed partly by the root of the crifta galli, which is very fmooth, and fometimes, it is faid, hollow or cellular. 2. Exadtly oppofite to this', and in the fame dire&ion with it, i. e. perpendicular to the ssthmoid plate. Hands

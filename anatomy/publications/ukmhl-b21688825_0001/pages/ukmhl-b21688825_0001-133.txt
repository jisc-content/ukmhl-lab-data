OF THE FACE AND JAWS, 89 4. From the lower circle of this bone, there projects a femicircle of bone, which is for lodging the teeth of the upper jaw. This circle of bone is as deep as the fangs of the teeth are long. And it may be very truly named a procefs (processus alveolaris) fmce it does not exiff in the foetus, nor till the teeth be-c gin to be formed j fmce it grows along with the teeth and is abforbed and carried clean away when in old age the teeth fall out. The Tides of the fockets in which the teeth are lodged are extremely thin, and furround them clofely. The teeth are fo clofely em- braced by their fockets, and we are fo far from being poffefled of any inftrument by which they can be pulled perpendicularly out, that the fockets can fek dom efcape ; they are broken or lplintered in perhaps one of four extractions, even by the moll dexterous artifts in that line. 5. The palate process is a plate of bone which divides the nofe from the mouth, conftituting the roof of the palate, and the floor or bottom of the noftrils. This plate is thinner in its middle, and thicker at ei- ther edge: thus, it is thick where it firft comes off from the alveolar procefs ; it is thin in its middle ; and it is again thick where it meets its fellow of the oppo- fite fide. For at the place where the two upper jaw- bones meet, the palate plate is turned upwards, fo that the two bones are oppofed to each other in the middle of the palate, by a broad flat furface, which cannot be feen but by feparating the bones. This fur- face is fo very rough, that the middle palate future almoft refembles the futures of the fkull; and the max- illary bones are neither eaflly feparated, nor eafily joined

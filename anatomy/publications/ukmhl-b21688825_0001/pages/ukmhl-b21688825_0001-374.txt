And when the crura penis are inflated, the eredtors are feen of their proper length and form. The eredtor of each fide rifes by a flender tendon from the tuberofity of the os ifchium. It goes flelhy, thin, and flat, over the crus penis, like a thin covering. It ends in a delicate and flat tendon upon the crus penis, about two inches up ; and the tendon is fo thin and delicate, that it is hardly to be diftinguifhed from the membrane of the caver- nous body.

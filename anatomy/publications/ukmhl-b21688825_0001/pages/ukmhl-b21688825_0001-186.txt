142 OF THE TRUNK. There was a time when it was univerfally believed* that the joinings of the pelvis diffolved in every la« bour ; that the bones parted, and the openings were enlarged ; that the child pafled with greater eafe; and “ that this opening of the bafm was no lefs natu- £C ral than the opening of the womb.” By many ac* cidents, this opinion has been often ftrengthened and revived; and if authority could determine our opinion, we Ihould acknowledge, that the joinings of the pelvis were always dilfolved, as a wife provifion of nature for facilitating natural, and preventing lingering, labour, compenfating for the frequent deviations, both in the head and pelvis, from their true and natural fize. This unlucky opinion has introduced, at one time, a practice the moll reprehenfibly fimple ; as fomentations to foften thefe joinings of the pelvis in circumftanCes which require very fpeedy help; while, at another time, it has been the apology for the moil cruel un- natural operations of inftruments, not merely intended for dilating and opening the foft parts, but for burft- ing up thefe joinings of the bones. And thofe alfoy of late years, who have invented and performed (too often no doubt) this operation of cutting the fymphy- fis pubis to haften the labour, fay, that they do not perform an unneceffary cruel operation, but merely imitate a common procefs of nature.

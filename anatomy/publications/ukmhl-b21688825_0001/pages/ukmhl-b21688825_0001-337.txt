293 OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The u 3 flefhy, compofed of tendon and flefli mixed ; filling up the hollow by the Tides of the fpines of the neck, and terminating in a broad flefhy head, which is fixed un- der the ridge of the occipital bone ; and this is the part which is feen in the angle or forking of the fplenii. This may hand as the general defcription of the mufcle confidered as one; but Albinus has chofen to defcribe it as two mufcles, under two different names, with a minutenefs, which, far from clearing the de- monftration of any difficulties, makes it lefs diftinft j and, if any thing could complete the confufion, it was his humour of calling that eiventer which had been, hitherto named complexus, and naming the lower part of the mufcle complexus, though it never had been diflinguifhed from the reft. The biventer of Albinus is the upper layer of the mufcle, that part which appears in the fork of the fplenii: And if we have hitherto named it complexus, from its mixture of tendons and flefh, it is particularly improper to transfer that name to another part of the mufcle which is lefs complicated. This upper layer, the biventer cervicis, arifes by a large broad head from the occipital bone. In the centre of this belly there iÂ§ a confufion of tendon ; then there is a middle tendon, about the middle of the arch of the neck ; and the lower part; of the biventer arifes from two parts ; firft by one flip of flefli from the two uppermoft fpines of the back ; and, fecondly, by a larger flefhy portion which comes from the fourth, fifth, fixth, and feventh tranfverfe proceffes of the back. And it is from the upper and lower flefhy heads, and the confufed middle tendon, that it is called biventer.

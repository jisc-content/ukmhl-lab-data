OF THE TRUNK. I ig We 14 we incline, and returns in a moment to its place by a very powerful refilition. This perfect elafticity is the chief charafteriftic and virtue of this intervertebral fubftance; whofe properties indeed are bed explained byitsufes; for in the bendings of the body, it yields in a very confiderable degree, and rifes on the mo- ment that the weight or the force of the mufcles is removed. In leaping, in (hocks, or in falls, its elas- ticity prevents any harm to the fpine, while other lefs important joints are luxated and deftroyed, Du- ring the day, it is continually yielding under preffure ; fo that we are an inch taller in the morning than at night; we are (horter in old age than in youth ; and the aged fpine is bended forwards by the yielding of this part. Thefe curious fads were firft obferved by a ibrt of chance, and have fince been afcertained with particular care. Since preffure, in length of years, (hortens the fore part of the column of the fpine, and makes the body ftoop, any undue inclination to either fide will caufe diftortion: the fubftance yields on one fide, and rifes on the other; and at laft the fame change happens in the bones alfo, and the diftortion is fixed, and not to be changed. This is peculiarly apt to happen with chil- dren whofe bones are growing, and whofe griftles and intervertebral fubftances are peculialy foft; fo that a tumour on the head or jaw, which makes a boy carry his head on one fide, or conftant (looping, fuch as is ufed by a girl in working at the tambour, or the car- rying of a weakly child always on one arm by a negli- gent or awkward nurfe, will caufe in time a fixed in- curable diftortion.

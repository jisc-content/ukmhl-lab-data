SHOULDER, ARM, AND HAND. *75 the come from the lower part of the fcapula, are Implant, ed into the bone a little lower. The lesser tube- rosity has alfo a great mufcle fixed into it, viz. the fub-fcapularis mufcle. 4. The two tuberofities form betwixt them a groove, which is pretty deep ; and in it the long tendon of the biceps mufcle of the arm runs; and as it runs conti- nually, like a rope in the groove of a pulley, this groove is covered, in the frefii bones, with a thin carti- lage, fmooth, and like the cartilages of joints. The os humeri, at its lower part, changes its form, is flattened and compreifed below, and is fpread out into a great breadth of two inches or more; where there is formed, on each fide, a fharp projecting point (named condyle), for the origin of great mufcles; and in the middle, betwixt the two condyles, there is a grooved articulating furface, which forms the hinge of the elbow. 1. At the lower end of the bone, there are two ridges, one leading to either condyle, which it is of fome confequence to obferve; for the elbow-joint is a mere hinge, the moil flrictly fo of any joint in the body ; it has, of courfe, but two motions, viz. flexion and extenfion; and it has two mufcles chief- ly, one for extending, the other for bending, the arm. The flexor mufcle lies on the fore part, and the ex- tenfor on the back part of the arm; and fo the whole thicknefs of the arm is compofed, at this place, of thefe turn mufcles and of the bone: but that the fore and back parts of the arm might be thoroughly divided, the bone is flattened betwixt them ; and that the divifion might extend beyond the mere edges of

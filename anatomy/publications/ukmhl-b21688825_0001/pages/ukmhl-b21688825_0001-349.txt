MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. 305 from the upper oblique proceffes, and from the root of the tranfverfe proceffes. In the back it arifes from the tranfverfe proceffes, and therefore arifes there by- more diflindd heads. In the neck, again, it arifes from the lower oblique proceffes more confufedly. Its bundles or fafciculi are inferted into the fpinous proceffes ; fometimes into the fecond, or even into the third or fourth fpine, above that from which the bundle arifes ; for the tendons do not flop at that fpinous pro- cefs which they firfl touch, but go upwards, taking at- tachments to other two or three, and mixing their ten- dons with thofe of the fafciculi above and below ; and thefe tendons reach from the firfl of the loins to all the vertebra;, up to the atlas, which is the only one not included. The ufe of the multifidus fpinae is to retain the fpine from being too much bent forwards; for thefe mufcles ferve (as I have obferved) the purpofe of a ligament, and the belt of all ligaments, having a de- gree of flrength exaddly proportioned to the neceffity for flrength. It alfo moves the fpine backwards, though perhaps it is lefs ufeful in this than as a liga- ment 5 for we find it as flrong in the vertebra of the back, which have little motion, and that, little Very flow and general. It feems rather intended to mode- rate the lateral motions of the vertebrae than to pro- duce them: When it adds, its chief ufe is either to refill the fpine being bent forward by a weight, or to eredd the fpine.

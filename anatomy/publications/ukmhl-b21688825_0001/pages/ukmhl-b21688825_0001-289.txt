MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 24$ then their edges only are feen; but when fully differed from the other mufcles, they are quite flat. The teres minor is a long, fmall flefliy mufcle; it arifes from the angle, and all the lower edge of the fcapula: it is like the infra fpinatus; it becomes early tendinous, but the tendon is accompanied with flefliy fibres from below; its flat tendon, in palling over the joint, is attached to the capfuie, and is finally inferted into the great tuberofity of the Ihoulder-bone, fo that it mull have exaftly the fame ufes as the two former mufcles. It is feparated from the infra fpinatus by that tendinous expansion with which the latter is covered; it looks like a part of the fame mufcle in its origin, where it lies upon the fcapula; but is very diftindt in its tendon. The fupra fpinatus, infra fpinatus, and teres minor, raife the arm. LXXVI. The teres major, is in lhape like the former, lies lower upon the edge of the fcapula than the teres minor, and is thicker and longer than it. It arifes chiefly from the angle of the fcapula; partly from the lower edge of the fcapula at its back part; it is oonneftedwith the teres minor and infra spinatus. It is a large thick and flat mufcle, and forms a flat Itrong tendon, which paflfes under the long head of the triceps. It paflfes under the os humeri; turns round it, and is inferted into the ridge, on the inner fide of the groove, and gives fome tendinous fibres to line the groove. In Ihort, it accompanies the tendon of the latiflimus dorfi, is inferted along with it, and may be confidered as the congener of the latiflimus dorfi ; and the two tendons are inclofed in one common cap- fuie or Ibeath of cellular fubftance.

OF THE TRUNK. 111 \ very long and aquiline. They are broad at their bafts, and very fmall or fpinous at their further end ; and in place of (landing perpendicularly out from the body, they are fo bent down, that they do not form a promi- nent nor unfightly fpine, but are ranged almoft in a perpendicular line ; that is, laid over each other, like the fcales of armour, the one above touching the one below, by which the motions of thefe vertebra are dill further abridged. And, laftly, the transverse pro- cesses, which are (hort and knobby, in place of (land- ing free and clear out, like thofe of the loins, are tra- melled and reflridled from motion, by their connexion, with the ribs; for the ribs are not merely implanted upon the bodies of the dorfal vertebra, but they are further attached firmly by ligaments, and by a regular joint to the tranfverfe procefs of each vertebra. Now the rib being fixdd to the body of one vertebra, and to the tranfverfe procefs of the vertebra below, the mo- tions of the vertebra are much curbed. And we alfo get another mark by which the dorfal vertebra may be known, viz. that each vertebra bears two impreflions of the rib that was joined to it, one on the flat fide of its body, and the other on the forepart of its tranfverfe procefs. Of the vertebras of the neck.-â€”The vertebra of the neck depart (till farther from the common form. Their bodies are flattened on their fore parts, fo as to make a flat furface on which the windpipe and gullet lie fmooth. The body is very fmall in all the vertebra of the neck. In the upper mo ft of the neck there is abfolutely no body 5 and the next to that has not a body of the regular and common form. There is not in

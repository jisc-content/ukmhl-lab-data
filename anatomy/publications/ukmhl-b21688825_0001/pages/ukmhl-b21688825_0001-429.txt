CHAP. IX. OF THE MUSCULAR POWER, * rhat contractile power which refid.es in the mufcular or living fibre, is a phenomenon the moll wonderful and perplexing of all. When we cannot reach the true point, the mind too often condefcends to the moft trifling purfuits : And fo, when the older phyfiologifts could not underhand the intrinsic nature of this muf- cular power, they endeavoured to difcover the fize, the colour, and other external properties of the fibre ; foolifhly defiring to know what, if known, could be of no avail. Colour was believed to be efiential to the conflitution of a mufcle: but in fowls, in amphi- bious animals, in fifhes, in worms, and infedls, through all the gradations of animals, of different fpecies or different fizes, the colours of the mufcular fibre change. In fifhes and in infers it is entirely w7hite; even in the human body it is not effentially red; the fibres of the iris, the mufcular coats of the arteries, the muf- cles of the flomach, of the inteflines, and of the uri- nary bladder, are colourlefs: the blood which makes this fibre red in the other parts may be wafhed away. vol. i. c c Then

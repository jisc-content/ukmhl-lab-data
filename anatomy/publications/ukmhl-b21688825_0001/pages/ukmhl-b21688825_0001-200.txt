BONES OF THE 356 infertion of all the mufcles, and this obliquity of the ankles; the inner ankle advancing a little before the joint, and the outer ankle receding in the fame degree behind it. The fibula, which is named fo from its refemblance to the Roman clafp, is a long, flender bone, which is ufe- ful partly in ftrengthening the leg, but chiefly in form- ing the ankle joint; for the tibia only is connected with the knee, while the fibula, which has no place in the knee joint, goes down below the lower end of the tibia, forming the long procefs of the outer ankle. The fibula is a long and flender bone, the longeft and flenderefl in the body. It lies by the fide of the tibia like a fplint j fo that when at any time the tibia is broken without the fibula, or when the tibia having fpoiled, becomes carious, and a piece of it is loft, the fibula maintains the form of the limb till the laft piece be replaced, or till the fracture be firmly reunited. It is, like the tibia, triangular, and has two heads, which are knots, very large, and difproportioned to fo flender a bone. The fharpeft line of the fibula is turned to one fharp line of the tibia, and the interoffeous mem- brane paffes betwixt them. The bone lies in a line with the tibia, on the outer fide of it, and a little behind it. The upper head of the fibula is laid upon a plain fmooth furface, on the fide of the tibia, a little below the knee ; and thpugh the fibula is not received deep into the ti- bia, this want is compenfated for by the ftrong liga- ments by which this little joint is tied by the knee, being completely wrapped round with the expanded tendons of thofe great mufcles which make up the thigh, by the knee being ftill farther embraced clofely

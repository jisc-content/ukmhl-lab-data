HO OF THE TRUNK. and would even have hindered, in fome degree, the nodding of the head ; therefore the atlas has a fimple ring behind, and has only a fmall knob or button where the fpinous procefs fhould be. The trans- verse process is not forked, but it is perforated with a large hole for the vertebral artery; and the artery to get into the fkuil makes a wide turn, lying flat upon the bone, by which there is a flight hollow or impreffion of the artery., which makes the ring of the vertebra exceedingly thin. But the form of the dentatus bell explains thefe pe- culiarities of the atlas, and this turning of the head. The dentatus or axis, is fo named from its projedting point, which is the chief charadteriftic of this bone. When the dentatus is placed upright before us, we obferve, i. That it is moft remarkably coni- cal ; rifmg all the way upwards, by a gradual flopey to the point of its tooth-like procefs.. 2. That the ring of the vertebra is very deep, that is, very thick, in its fob fiance ; and that the opening of the ring for tranfmitting the fpinal marrow is of a triangular form,. 3. That its fpinous procefs is fhort, thick, and forked ; and that it is turned much downwards, fo as not to- interfere, in any degree, with the rotation of the at- las. 4. That its tooth-like procefs, from which the- bone is named, is very large, about an inch in length ; very thick, like the little Anger; that it is pointed y and that from this rough point a flrong ligament goes /upwards, by which the tooth is tied to the great hole of the occipital bone. We alfo obferve a neck or collar, or fmaller part, near the root of the tooth-like procefs.

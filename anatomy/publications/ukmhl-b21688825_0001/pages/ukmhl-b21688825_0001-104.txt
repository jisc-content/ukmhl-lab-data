THE in which the tendon of one of the mufcles of the eye plays; the other, a more gentle and diffufed hollow, lies under the external angular procefs, is not deep, but is wide enough- to receive the point of a fin- ger, and is the place where the lachrymal gland lies ; that gland which fecretes the tears, and keeps the eye moi ft. OSSA PARIETALIA.â€”The parietal bones form by much the greater fhare of the cranium: they are more expofed than any others; they are the rnoft fre- quently broken, and the mod eafily trepanned ; for the parietal bones are more uniform in their thicknefs, and more regular in their two tables and diploe, than any others. But the accidental varieties of pits and de- preflions are very frequent in them ; and the fmus or great vein, and the artery which belongs to the mem- branes cf the brain, both make their chief impreffions upon this bone. Each parietal bone is very nearly of a fquare form, furrounded by deeply ferrated edges, which unite them with each other, and with the occipital and frontal bones. All the corners of this bone are obtufe, except that one which lies in the temple, and which, running out to a greater length than the other corners, is fometimes named the spinous process of the parietal bone ; though there can be no true procefs in a bone fo regu- lar and flat. The lower edge of the bone is a neat concave femicircle, which joins the parietal to the tem- poral bone; and the edge of each is fp flaunted off, that the edge of the temporal overlaps the edge of the parietal, with a thin fcale, forming the fquamous future.

MUSCLES OF THE 222 The raufcles which move the parts of the larynx upon each other are much finaller, and many of them very minute. XLL The hyo-thyroideus goes down, flelhy and Ihort, from the os hyoides, to the thyroid cartilage. It arifes from the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, where the fterno-thyroideus terminates, and goes up along the fide of the thyroid cartilage, like a continua- tion of the fterno-thyroideus mufcles. It paftes the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and is fixed to the lower edge of the os hyoides, along both its bafe and part of its horn. XLII. The crico-thyroideus isaveryfhort muf- cle, palling from the upper edge of the cricoid to the lower margin of the thyroid cartilage, chiefly at its fide, and partly attached to its lower horn; which comes down clafpingthe fide of the cricoid ring, fo that it is broader above, and a little pointed below. Thefe two finall mufcles mull; have their ufe, and they bring the thyroid cartilage nearer to the os hyoi- des, and the cricoid nearer to the thyroid cartilage; and by thus fhortening the trachea, or comprefling it flightly, they may perhaps affeft the voice. But the mufcles on which the voice chiefly depends, are thofe of the rim a glottidis ; for there is a double fet of mul- cles for the little arytenoid cartilages; one fet which brings the cartilages together, and another fet which draws them apart, and fpreads the opening of the larynx.. XLIII. The musculus arytenoideus transver- sus is that delicate mufcle which contrafts the glottis, by drawing the arytenoid cartilages towards each other. It lies acrofs, betwixt them, at their back part j it arifes 5 from

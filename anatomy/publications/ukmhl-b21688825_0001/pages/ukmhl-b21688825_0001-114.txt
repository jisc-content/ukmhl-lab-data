70 DESCRIPTION OF THE dura is a nerve of the face, palling through the ear, but forming no part of that organ. Thus the two nerves, the portio dura and the portio mollis, enter to- gether ; they fill the greater hole, and then they part j the portio dura, entering by one difiinft hole, takes its courfe along a diftinft canal, the aqueduft of Fallo- pius, from which it comes out upon the cheek ; while the portio mollis, entering by many fmaller holes in- to the cochlsea, femicircular canals, and other internal parts of the ear, is expanded in thefe cavities to form the proper organ of hearing. 3. There is upon the fore part of the petrous bone: a fmall hole which will admit the point of a pin. This hole receives a fmall twig reflected from the fifth pair of nerves : the nerve is as fmall as a fewing thread; it can be traced along the petrous bone by a fmall groove which conducts it to the hole \ and when it enters the ear, it goes into the fame canal with the portio dura, and joins itfelf to it. 4. The hole by which the portio dura paffes out upon the cheek, is found juft before the mafloid, and behind the ftyloid procefs j and being betwixt the two, it is named the stylo-mastoid hole, and is fo fmall, as juft to admit a pin. 5. The hole for the Euftachian tube is very irregular. No air can pafs through the membrane of the drum ; and as air is neceffary within the ear, it is conveyed upwards from the palate by the iter a palato ad aurem, or as it commonly called, the Eustachian tube. This tube is long, and of a trumpet fofm ; its mouth, by which it opens behind the noftril, is wide enough to receive the point of the finger; it grows gradually

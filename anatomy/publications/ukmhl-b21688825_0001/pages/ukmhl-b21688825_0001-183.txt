OF THE TRUNK, 139 â€¢with the branch of the ifchium, forms with it the arch of the pubis, and the edge of the thyroid hole. This completes the drift anatomy of the pelvis ; But when we confider the whole, it is further ne- celfary to repeat, in fhort definitions, certain points which are oftener mentioned as marks of other parts. The promontory of the facrum is the projection formed by the lowed vertebra of the loins and the upper point of that bone. The hollow of the fa- crum is all that fmooth inner furface which gives out the great nerves for the legs and pelvis. The lesser angle, in diftinftion from the greater angle or promon- tory of the facrum, is a fhort turn in the bone near where it is joined with the coccyx. The crest of the pubis is a fharper ridge or edge of the bone over the joining or fymphyfis pubis. The posterior sym- physis of the pelvis is the joining of the facrum with the ilium, while the fymphyfis pubis is didinguifhed by the name of anterior-symphysis of the pelvis. The spine, the tuber, and the ramus of the ifchium are fufficiently explained. The ala, or wing, the spine, the spinous processes, and the linea inno- minate of the ilium, are alfo diffidently explained. The acetabulum, fo named from its refemblance to a meafure which the ancients ufed for vinegar, is the hollow or focket for the thigh-bone, compofed of the ilium, ifchium, and pubis ; the ridge in its centre fhows the place of its original cartilage, and points out what proportion belongs to each bone; that it is made, two-fifths by the os ilium, two-fifths by the os ifchium, and one fifth only by the os pubis : but the

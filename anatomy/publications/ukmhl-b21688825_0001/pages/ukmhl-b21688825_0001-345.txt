301 MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. the CXXIX. The transversal is colli is that which Sabbatier refers to the longiffimus dorfi; but it is a diftinft mufcle, arifulg partly tendinous and partly flefhy from the five upper tranfverfe procelfes of the back; lies betwixt the trachelo maftoideus and the cer- vicalis defcendens ; goes from the tranfverfe procelfes of the back to the tranfverfe procelfes of the neck, and has no more than a confufed and irregular connexion with any other mufcle. TheguADRATus lumborum keeps the trunk ere£t by the aftion of both mufcles at once ; inclines it to one fide, or turns it upon its axis, when one only a£ts ; and by its infertion into the ribs mult afiifl in high breathing, by pulling down the ribs. The longissi- mus dorsi has no power but over the fpine, which it bends backwards, acting continually in keeping the trunk eredt. This is alfo the chief ufe of the facro- lumbalis ; but the sacro-lumbalis going out further upon the ribs, takes fuch hold upon them, that befides its common aflrion of railing the trunk, it may, on oc- cafions, pull them down, allifting the quadratus and the lower ferrated mufcle. And it will have greater power in turning the trunk of the body upon its axis than the longiffimus dorfi, which pull almoft diredlly backwards. The cervicalis descendens co-operates with the trachelo maftoideus and others, which turn the longiffimus dorfi fends its longeft tendon fairly up into the cervi- calis defcendens fo far, that the flip is implanted into the tranfverfe procelfes of the neck. And, fecondly, the feet of the cervicalis de- fcendens begin under the laft tendons of the facro-lumbalis, fo as to have the appearance of arifing from its fupplementary mufcle, the ad- ditamentum, and being part of it; and indeed Sabbatier has de- ferred it according to this view.

140 OF THE TRUNK. the ifchium has the greateft {hare; the ifchium form- ing more than two-fifths, and the ilium lefs. The brim of the pelvis is that oval ring which parts the cavity of the pelvis from the cavity of the abdomen : it is formed by a continued and prominent line along the upper part of the facrum, the middle of the ilium, and the upper part or creft of the pubis. This circle of the brim fupports the impregnated womb; keeps it up againfi: the preflure of the labour pains ; and fometimes this line has been “ as {harp as a paper- “ folder, and has cut acrofs the lower fegment of the “ womb and fo by feparating the womb from the vagina, has rendered the delivery impoflible ; and the child efcaping into the abdomen among the inteftines, the woman has died. The o utlet of the pelvis is the lower circle again, compofed by the arch of the pubis, and by the fciatic ligaments, which is wide and dilatable, to permit the delivery of the child ; but which, being fometimes too wide, permits the child’s head to prefs fo fuddenly, and with fuch violence, up- on the foft parts, that the perineum is torn. The thyroid hole is that remarkable vacancy in the bone which perhaps lightens the pelvis, or perhaps allows the foft parts to efcape from the preflure during the paflage of the head of the child. The marks of the female ficeleton have been fought for in the {kull, as in the continuation of the fagittal future; but the truefl: marks are thofe which relate to that great function by which chiefly the fexes are diftinguiflied : for while the male pelvis is large and ftrong, with a fmall cavity, narrow openings, and bones of greater flrength ; the female pelvis is very {hallow and wide, with a large cavity and {lender bones.

MUSCLES OF THE ARM, &C. 275 The flelhy belly commonly divides itfelf into two or three, fometimes four flelhy flips, with diftinft tendons ; which crofling the radius obliquely, flip under the ex- ternal ligament of the carpus, and are implanted into the root of the firft metacarpal bone, or rather of the firft phalanx of the thumb, towards the radial edge ; fo that its chief ufe is to extend the thumb, and to in- cline it a little outwards towards the radius. It mull alfo, like the extenfors of the fingers, be an extenfor of the wrift: and it evidently muft, from its oblique direction, afiift in fupination. XCIX. The extensor secundus pollicis is long- er than the firft. It is named by Douglas the extenfor fecundi internodii pollicis; by Albinus the extenfor minor pollicis. This mufcle lies clofe by the former. It arifes juft below it, from the fame edge of the radius, and from the fame furface of the interofleous membrane; it runs along with it in the fame bending courfe; and, in Ihort, it refembles it fo much, that Winflow has reck- oned it as part of the fame mufcle. Its origin is from the edge of the ulna, the interof- feous ligament, and the radius. Its fmall round ten- don paffes fometimes in a peculiar channel, fometimes with the extenfor primus. It goes over the metacar- pal bone of the thumb ; it expands upon the bone of the firft phalanx ; and it is inferted j\ift under the fe- cond joint. It extends the fecond bone of the thumb upon the firft j it extends the firft bone alfo ; and it extends the wrift, and by its oblique direction, contributes to fu- pination. v T 2 G. Ex-

MtTSCLES MOVING THE THIGHBONE* 339 would be found there though this mufcle were away, as in the palmaris of the hand. This fafcia confifts properly of two plates; one is that which comes down from the creft of the ilium, and from the mufcles of the belly 5 the other, that which arifes purely from the tendon of the mufculus fafcialis, and which is, at the fame time conne&ed with the cap- fular ligament of the femur and with the trochanter; and fo the mufcle lies betwixt the two plates of the fafcia; and as the fafcia at this part takes at leaft a reinforcement from the capfular ligament, and from about the trochanter major, the fafcialis mufcle may be faid to be inferted into the trochanter. So this great tendinous fafcia has thefe connections : the creft of the ilium ; the ligament of Paupart at the rim of the belly j the creft and arch of the pubis ; the tuber ifchii, and fo back along the coccyx to the ridge and proceffes of the facrum j the ligament of the joint, the great trochanter, and the linea afpera, all the way down to the knee, where its laft adhefion is very ftrong, and from whence it comes off again much ftrengthened. It is thicker on the outer fide and back part, and very thin on the inner fide of the thigh ; and it dives with perpendicular divifions among the mufcles of the thigh. CLVI. The fascialis muscle. The mufcle is rightly named tenfor vaginas femoris 5 for hardly any other ufe can be afiigned. It arifes from the upper fpinous procefs of the ilium, i. e. from the fore part, or very point of its fpine, by a tendon of about an inch in length. It is very fmall at its origin and at its ter- z 2 ruination.

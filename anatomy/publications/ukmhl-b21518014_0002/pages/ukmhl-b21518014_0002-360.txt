NEUROLOGY. 984 above, the corpus callosum, displays a great medullary centre in each hemi- sphere (centre medullaire hemispheral; centrum ovale minus; acb,acb,fig. 277.), The two centres of the opposite sides together with the corpus callosum {d d) form the centrum ovale of Vieussens. The centrum ovale of Vieussens is contracted in the middle line, where it is formed by the corpus callosum, but is much larger in each hemisphere. The anfractuosities by which the circumference of this section is indented are seen to be deeper on the outside and behind, than on the inside and in front. By the three horizontal sections just described, it is shown that each convo- lution if ff) consists of a white central portion surroimded by a thick layer of grey substance, having a precisely similar shape ; that it is the grey matter which predominates in the convolutions ; that the central portions of all the convolutions are continuous with each other, and form the most complicated "windings ; that they all rest upon a hemispherical central mass, which becomes larger and larger towards the corpus callosum, on a level with which it attains its greatest dimensions; that the centrum ovale of Vieussens, which how- ever is not oval, represents the largest meduUary surface of the brain, and might be regarded as a centre from which all the radiations that enter the convolutions are given off in one direction, and in the other, all those which establish connexions between the brain and the other parts of the cerebro- spinal axis; lastly, that the centrum ovale and the convolutions are always developed in a corresponding ratio. TTie Corpus Callosum. If wCen the brain is resting upon its base, the two hemispheres be drawn asunder, a transverse white band is seen at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure, extending from one hemisphere to the other, and connecting them

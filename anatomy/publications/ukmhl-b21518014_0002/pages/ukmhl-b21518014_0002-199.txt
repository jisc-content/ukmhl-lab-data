THE LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 823 of a certain number of glands into one. Sometimes we find a large circular gland situated around the termination of the saphenous vein. The inguinal glands, moreover, are placed at different depths in the substance of the fibrous lavers which constitute the superficial fascia. Several of these glands are frequently united to each other, not only by lymphatic vessels, but also by prolongations of their proper substance. The Lymphatic Vessels which enter the Lymphatic Glands of the Lower Extremity. Preparation. Introduce the pipe into some of the lymphatic vessels between the toes, over the metatarso-phalangal articulations. Mascagni employed this method, which is as easy as introducing the pipe into the vessels which run between the internal malleolus and the skin. A still better method of in- jection, when it proves successful, is to fill the lymphatic network in the skin, by introducing the pipe into the dermis at any point, beneath the cuticle. But the limb requires to be warmed for this injection to succeed. I have made a very beautiful preparation by injecting the cutaneous network of lymphatics upon the sole of the foot in a new-born infant. The mercury ran as far as the glands situated along the iliac vessels. If the pipe be inserted into the skin upon the scrotum, or into the mucous membrane covering the glans penis in the male, or into the skin of the labia majora in the female, the mercury will reach the lymphatic glands of the groin. The lymphatics which ramify in the gluteal region, and those situated in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the abdominal parietes, may be injected in the same manner. The deep lymphatics of the leg open into the anterior tibial gland and pop- Uteal glands. All the superficial lymphatics of the lower extremity and also those of the gluteal region, perineum, external genital organs, and sub-umbilical portion of the parietes of the abdomen, terminate in the inguinal glands. Lymphatics of the lower extremities. The lymphatics of the lower extremities, like the veins, are divided into superficial and deep. The deep-seated lymphatics are fewer in number and less accurately known than the superficial; they accompany the deep-seated bloodvessels. It is pro- bable that every arterial and venous branch has its corresponding lymphatics; but those only which accompany the great vessels have been as yet discovered. They are divided into the peroneal, the anterior and posterior tibial, and the femoral. Of the anterior tibial lymphatics two only have been demonstrated, although their number must certainly be greater. One of these accompanies the plantar arch, the dorsal artery and vein of the foot, and the anterior tibial vessels ; it communicates with the posterior tibial and the peroneal lymphatics, opposite the upper part of the mterosseous Ugament, and enters the anterior tibial gland, or more frequently perforates the interosseous ligament, and enters the popU- The other anterior tibial lymphatic arises deeply from the outer side of the foot, and joins the preceding. Th^ posterior tibial lymphatics, two or three in number, and likewise the peronea/lymphatics, sometimes unite into a single trunk, and enter the popliteal glands. iZ^l^\T^^' ^^'""^ 'T'S' ^'■""^ P°Plite^ gl^ds, five or six in number, ^^'^PfT the. adductor muscle, ascend along the femoral vein and open mto the deep inguinal glands r..^}^t''P'fu'''\ Z^™^^"'^''^*' ^^^^"^ ca^i be very easily shown to arise from a W S V r^^P^f^^ inwards, to reach the inner side of The ir?:^ f «=o^dyle of the femur: those wh ch ^ theT±.°"/T."^'.°^*^' "^-^l^S- ^t«^ ascending verticaUy in fron of the muscles of the anterior region of the leg, cross over the upper part of

NEUROLOGY. 1076 tomose with that nerve, while the others are distributed to the skin upon the internal and posterior region of the leg. In the sheath of the adductor magnus the saphenous nerve gives off an articular Jilament, which passes vertically downwards in the substance of the internal intermuscular septum, gains the knee joint, perforates the fibrous layer, and may be traced into the synovial adipose tissue.* Terminal branches. The anterior, reflected, or patellar branch (u,figs. 291, 292.) perforates the sartorius f opposite to the back of the internal condyle, is reflected forwards and downwards in a flattened form upon the inner side of the knee joint, parallel to and above the tendon of the sartorius, and expands widely into ascending filaments, which pass in front of the ligamentum patellae, and turn roimd the lower and then the outer borders of the patella ; into de- scending filaments, which cross obliquely over the crest of the tibia, and ramify in the skin -which covers the external region of the leg; and into middle filaments, which occupy the space between the two preceding sets ; they are all distributed to the skin, and several of them anastomose with the cutaneous filaments upon the external re^on of the patella. The posterior or straight branch (<') is larger than the preceding, and con- tinues in the original course of the nerve; it almost always receives an anastomotic branch from the obturator nerve, passes in front of the tendon of the gracilis, then between the sartorius and that tendon, which it crosses very obliquely, to meet the internal saphenous vein (s), whose direction it then follows : having arrived opposite the junction of the three upper fourths with the lower fourth of the leg, it divides into two branches, the one, posterior and smaller, passes vertically downwards in front of the internal malleolus, upon which it ramifies; some of the filaments reaching as far as the skin upon the inner side of the sole of the foot; the other branch, which is anterior and larger, runs along the internal saphenous vein, like it, is situated in front of the internal surface of the tibia, then in front of the internal malleolus, and expands into articular branches, which enter the tibio-tarsal articulation, and into cutaneous filaments, which ramify in the skin upon the inner side of the tarsus. The following are the relations of the saphenous nerve with the internal saphenous vein—the nerve is at first placed in front of the vein, then crosses obliquely under it to get behind it, and lastly it again returns to its position in front of the vessel. During its course along the leg the posterior branch of the saphenous nerve gives off some internal and some external branches : the internal branches are very small; the upper ones anastomose with the tibial cutaneous branch of the trunk of the internal saphenous nerve, and concur with it in supplying filaments to the skin of the back of the leg. The external branches, three or four in number, are large, and in this respect diminish froni above down- wards ; their direction is obliquely dovniwards and outwards, in front of the tibia, which they cross ; their course is a long one, and they are distributed extensively to different portions of the skin of the leg All these divisions are parallel to each other, and to the anterior reflected or patellar branch of the saphenous nerve. t The°artormJiIf therefore, perforated in succession by three cutaneous branches, namely, two perforating branches from the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and one from the internal taph-

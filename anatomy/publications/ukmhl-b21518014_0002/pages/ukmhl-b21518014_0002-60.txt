ANGEIOLOGY. 684 to the platysma myoides, which separates it from the skin. The cervical fascia, the superior thyroid vein, and the descendens noni, a branch of the hypoglossal nerve, are in more immediate relation with it. The most im- portant of these relations is that with the stemo-mastoid, which, in a surgical point of view, may be regarded as its satellite muscle. Behind the common carotid is the vertebral column, from which it is separated by the pre-vertebral muscles, the great sympathetic nerve, and below by the recurrent nerve and in- ferior thyroid artery. On the inside it is in relation with the trachea, oesophagus, larynx, and thyroid gland, which passes in front of the artery when larger than usual; ore the outside of the artery is the internal jugular vein. The pneumogastric nerve lies at the back, between the artery and vein. The common carotids are also surrounded by much loose cellular tissue, and by some lymphatic glands. The left common carotid is in more direct relation with the oesophagus than the artery of the right side. The common carotids give off no branch during their course : nevertheless, it is not very rare for this artery to give off the inferior thyroid artery, or a supernumerary branch, known as the middle thyroid. Neubauer has seen the common carotid give off a thyroid artery, and the internal mammary of the right side. Terminal branches. Having reached the upper border of the thyroid car- tilage, at a variable height, according to the subject, the common carotid divides into two branches, called the e.vternal and internal carotids, which, by no means a common arrangement, do not leave each other at an acute angle, but remain in contact, and even frequently become crossed before they sepa- rate. The point of division is also remarkable for a sort of ampulla or dila- Dissection. Prolong the incision made for exposing the common carotid as far as the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw. Dissect carefully the styloid muscles and the digastricus ; and cautiously separate the artery from the surrounding tissue of the parotid gland.

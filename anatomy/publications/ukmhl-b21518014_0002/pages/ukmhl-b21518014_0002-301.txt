THE DIMENSIONS OF THE SPINAL COIID. 925 The vertebral column, the dava. mater, the arachnoid, and the pia mater form a fourfold sheath for the spinal cord ; the first being osseous ; the second, fibrous ; the third, serous ; and the fourth, or proper sheath, both fibrous and vascular: this last-named membrane is accurately adapted to the cord, so as to support it, and gently compress it on all sides. The spinal cord is not suspended freely in the vertebral canal, but is attached on each side by a ligament, called the ligamentum denticulatum. The Ligamentum Denticulatum. The ligamentum denticulatum (c c, fig. 267.), so called from the toothlike prolongations which proceed from its outer bor- der, is an extremely slender, fibrous band, which runs along the side of the spinal cord, and adheres to the proper sheath of the cord by its inner border, which is very thin. The outer edge is free, thicker than the inner portion, and gives off certain toothlike prolongations, which are attached to the dura mater in the intervals between the canals formed by that membrane for the spinal nerves : the first denticulation of this ligament, which may be regarded as its origin, is very long, and is found opposite the margin of the foramen magnum, between the ■vertebral artery and the hypoglossal nerve ; the last, which is the twentieth or twenty-first, forms the termination of the liga- ment, and corresponds very nearly to the lower extremity of the spinal cord. The form, thinness, and length of these toothlike processes are subject to much variety. The ligamentum denticulatum is evidently fibrous, and cannot be regarded, as Bonn imagined, as a prolongation of the arachnoid. * The ligamentum denticulatum appears to answer the twofold use of assist- jug m fixing the spinal cord, and of separating the anterior (a) from the posterior (6) roots of the spinal nerves. The Dimensions of the Spinal Cord. The length of the spinal cord in the adult is from fifteen to eighteen inches Its circumference is twelve lines at the thinnest part, and eighteen at the thick- est. But It is of much less importance to determine the actual dimensions of the spinal cord, than to estimate its relative size as compared with that of the brain, or in reference to the capacity of the vertebral canal, or than to ex- amine the differences in size which it presents at different parts of its extent.

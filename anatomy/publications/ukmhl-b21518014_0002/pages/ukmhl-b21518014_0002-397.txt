But on examining the structure of the nervous anastomoses, it is seen that there is simply a juxtaposition of filaments derived from two different sources. The examination also proves most distinctly that the anastomoses are merely small plexuses, so that the only difference between them is, that, tn the plexuses, there is an interchange of nervous cords, whilst tn the anastomoses there is an interchange of nervous filaments or of primitive fibres. The anastomoses, like the plexuses, are intended to concentrate the action of several nerves upon any given point, as on a centre, from which their action may extend to certain parts necessarily connected in function. The nervous loops described by Bichat upon all points of the median Ime of the body, and by the existence of which he supposed that he could explain the return of sensation and voluntary motion to paralytic parts of the body, do not exist. The only anastomoses in the middle line with which I am ac- quainted are those of the two pneumogastric nerves, behind the lower ex- tremity of the trachea, that of the two solar plexuses, and that of the cardiac nerves. The Direction, Relations, and Mode of Division of the Nerves. The nerves are very deeply situated at their egress from the cranio-verte- bral cavity. Thus the brachial plexus is protected by the osseous girdle of the shoulders, and the sacral plexus by the pelvic bones. The nerves then pass into the great cellular intervals, which we have already described as ex- isting in the limbs fox the reception of the principal vessels and nerves, and for the preservation of those parts from pressure. The direction of the nerves is generally straight, and their length corre- sponds exactly with the distance from their point of origin to that of their termination, so that, if the movements of the limbs exceed their ordinary extent, the nerves may suffer severe injury by being stretched. This straight direction is, in general, an essential character of a nerve. Nevertheless, a considerable number of nerves deviate from their primitive direction f, so as to describe a portion of a circle, or are seen reflected upon themselves in a direction precisely opposite to their original one. Others describe a zigzag course like the arteries, but these flexuosities are effaced in certain positions of the body, or during the distension of particular organs. Although there is but one arterial trunk for each limb, there are always * Anat. Generale, p. 659. t I do not think that a straight direction is necessary for the transmission of the nervous influence, for this talies place In a flexed limb along a curved nerve, as well as in an extended limh along a straight nerve; hut it it probable that it shortens the duration of this trans- mission.

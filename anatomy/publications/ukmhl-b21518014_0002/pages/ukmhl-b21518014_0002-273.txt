THE OSSICULA OF THE EAR. 897 S 2 chorda tyrapani describes a curve, having its concavity directed downwards, passes bet-n-een the handle of the malleus and the long ramus of the incus, enters its proper canal upon the inner side of the fissure of Glasserius, and emerges at the point already mentioned. Magnified three iliameters. The Ossicula of the Ear. The tympanum is traversed from without inwards by an osseous chain, which describes several angles, and consists of four bones articulated with each other, and extended from the membrana tympani to the fenestra ovalis. These little bones, forming the links of the chain, are named, from their respective shapes, malleus, or hammer (\,fig. 256.) ; the incus, or anvil , z J (2)-; the OS orSfcM/are, or round bone (4) ; and the sfa^ie.?, CN ^\ a or stirrup-bone (3) : the os orbiculare, however, appears y\ merely a tubercle belonging to the incus. t The malleus. The malleus (1, fig. 256.) is the most anterior of the bones of the ear ; it is divided into a head, a neck, and a handle, and it has also two processes. The head of the malleus (a, fig. 257.) is situated in the recess of the tym- panum, in front of the incus, and above the membrana tympani. It is ovoid, and smooth, excepting behind and below, where it is con- cave in order to be articulated with the incus. Sommerring has figured a small fibrous cord, which he calls the proper ligament of the mal- leus, extending from the head of this bone to the upper part of the recess of the tympanum. The head is supported by a constricted neck (i), -which is slightly twisted and flattened, and serves also as a support for the two processes. The handle (manubrium, c) is directed vertically, and with the head and neck forms a very obtuse angle, which retreats on the inner side ; it is in contact with, and adheres firmly to the internal surface of the membrana tym- pani, opposite the centre of which its rounded extremity is placed ; it therefore forms a radms to the circle represented by the membrana tympani. The lower part of the handle of the malleUs is distinctly curved, having its concave side turned outwards ; this explains the funnel-shaped depression upon the external surface of the centre of the membrana tympani. The^rocessesofthe malleus are two in number ; the external, or short process {d-) IS directed shghtly outwards, and rests against the upper part of the margin of the membrana tympani, so as to make it project outwards; the other, or process, is very slender (processus gracilis of JRaw, e), and i shaped like a thorn (processus sptnosus) : it arises from the anterior part of the neck enters he Glassenan fissure, and affords attachment to a muscular or fibrous cord I have several times found a simple ligamentous cord instead of this process fn^ ZT\ ^^'^-T -^^^ 25^-) compared to^a bicuspid mX X:^^^^^^^^ representedby the.o.,o^f the incus, andTe tJ^n'^'-' ^'-i^-9°°t^'°e<i in the recess of the tympanum behind the malleus, with which it is articulated by a very concave surfacr directpS :Z^:t^"^ f ^^P"^^'^^' «othat';heartfcrt on b^^^^^^^^

Gall, taking a more com- prehensive view of this subject, attempted to determine what parts of the brain were connected by this means, and to discover the general law which governs the arrangement of the commissures, which he believed to be formed by a sys- tem of fibres and bundles, named by him faisceaux rentrans ou convergens. We have seen that Gall traces the pyramidal and olivary fasciculi to the grey matter of the convolutions. According to him all the extremities of the medullary fibres penetrate the grey matter, which is therefore whiter internally than on the surface. Gall acknowledges that he has not been able to determine their ultimate distribution ; he does not know whether they terminate in the grey matter or turn back again towards the interior. Nevertheless, he con- siders it very probable that new medullary filaments originate in this grey layer, and that there is thus produced a system of fibres which reinforces the pre- ceding one, and is connected with it inter- nall)'. * According to Gall the commissures are, the corpus callosum, the fornix, and the anterior and posterior commissures. The corpus callosum (fde,fig.2S3.)is intended to unite the convolutions of the two hemispheres. Its anterior reflected portion unites the inferior convolutions of the two anterior lobes (/p a a). The enlarged posterior extremity (e) receives the fibres (s s) of the posterior convolutions (6) and the middle portion of those of the middle convolutions (c). The anterior commissure, which can Be so easily traced (m) through the cor- pus striatum into the convolution of the sphenoidal extremity of the posterior [middle] lobe, is regarded by Gall as the means of connecting certain corre- sponding convolutions in the sphenoidal portions of the two posterior [middle] lobes. The posterior commissm-e, which is lost in the substance of the optic thalami, and which is much smaller than the an- terior, fulfils the same purpose for those „ bodies. The posterior pillars (k) of the fornix are regarded by Gall as formm^^ commissure for the posterior convolutions of the two middle lobes. appears to him to result from the connexion of these P^'-^^' ^^..^^^"""''^^^ the interlacement called the lyra,to be composedof the connectmg filament H. error here is evident, for the fornix results from the 3f'^P"^^ "^.'^.'^ Zt dullary cords.

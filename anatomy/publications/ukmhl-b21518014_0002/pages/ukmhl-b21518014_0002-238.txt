Upon the cornea (rf') its adhesion is so intimate, that some anatomists have denied its existence in that situation. In fact, it can only be anatomically demonstrated in the healthy state upon the margin of the cornea, but its existence over the whole of that part of the eye is shown in some diseases. After having covered the anterior and inferior part of the sclerotic (c"), the conjunctiva is reflected upon the posterior sur- face of the lower eyelid (6'), lines its tarsal cartilage, covers its free margin, and then becomes continuous with the skin. On the inner side of the ball of the eye the conjunctiva forms a small semilimar fold, the plica semilunaris (e, f gs. 235. 239.), which has its concavity turned outwards, and which may be regarded as the vestige of the third eyelid found in animals: it is misnamed the membrana nictitans (la membrane clignotante). On the outer side, the con- junctiva dips between the eyelids and the ball of the eye, and forms a deep cul- de-sac. Opposite the lachrymal papillae the conjunctiva passes into the puncta, and lines the lachrymal passages. From what has been stated above it will be seen, that the conjunctiva would form a shut sac, like the serous membranes, if the eyelids were supposed to be united. Like the serous membranes, it covers two surfaces that rub one upon the other. Its tenuity, its transparency, and the filamentous adhesions which are sometimes observed between its contiguous surfaces, have induced some anatomists to place this membrane among the serous, rather than the mucous membranes; but its continuity with the skin, its extreme vascularity, and its uses, which require it to be in contact with the air, prove that it should be retained amongst the latter class of membranes. * The glands found in the eyelids consist of an appendage of the lachrymal gland, which wiU be described with it, of the Meibomian glands, and of the caruncula lachrymalis. The Meibomian glands (m m, fig. 236.) are situated upon the posterior surface /',■'. 2311. eyelids, opposite tlie tarsal cartilages ; they resemble yellowish vertical and parallel lines, some- times straight and sometimes curved; their length is proportioned to the depth of the cartilages, and they never project upon the inner surface of the eyelids. Each of these lines, of which there are from thirty to forty in each eyelid, consists of a tortuous canal, folded upon itself a great number of times, and having a considerable number of small follicles opening into it on each side. All these canals open very regularly upon the posterior lip of the free margin of the lid by a row of orifices arranged in a single line. I have never seen two rows of openings, as Zinn states he has observed. If the eyelids be compressed over the tarsal cartilages by a pair of pincers, masses of a waxy substance exude from these orifices, having the form of small worms twisted frequently upon themselves. Sometimes these » The absence of villi has been stated as characteristic of the conjunctiva; but villi or pa- pilliE are found upon that portion which lines the superior tarsal cartilage. „ji„„ ,„ FThe enitheliura of the conjunctiva is squamous, and consists of several layers; .vcoroing co Henle, it is ciliated upon the inner surface of the eyelid ; but cilia have not been observed upon the eyeball.]

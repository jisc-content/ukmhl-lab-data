ANGEIOLOGY. 730 index finger (x) and the internal collateral of the thumb derived from the superficial palmar arch; and still more rare to see the external collateral artery of the thumb («) given off by that arch. Whatever varieties there may be in the arteries of the palm of the hand, in reference to the share -which the radial and ulnar respectively take in the form- ation of the collateral arteries of the fingers, the following general facts are apparent in their distribution: — The size of the superficial and deep palmar arches respectively are always inversely proportioned to each other; the com- munication between the two arches takes place not only directly between the arches themselves, but also indirectly in a great number of points by their branches; all the descending branches of the deep palmar arch anastomose with the angle of bifurcation of the descending branches of the superficial palmar arch; those from the deep arch are sometimes smaller, sometimes larger, than those from the superficial arch; they are rarely of the same size, but always bear an inverse ratio to them ; the bifurcation of each digital branch of the super- ficial palmar arch takes place two or three lines below the metacarpo-phalan- gal articulation, opposite the junction of the body with the upper end of the first phalanx ; the collateral arteries of the fingers are situated upon the an- terior aspect of the phalanges, on each side of the sheath of the flexor tendons; they give off dorsal and palmar branches, and anastomose with each other in front of the body of the phalanges by small transverse branches; having reached the middle of the last phalanx, they anastomose in an arch, from the convexity of which a great number of anterior branches pass to the skin, over the last phalanx, and some dorsal branches to the matrix of the nail; one of these branches runs along the curved adherent border of the niul. The termination of the superficial palmar arch is subject to variety : thus, it terminates either by anastomosing with the radio-palmar or superficialis volse, of the same size as itself, or by receiving a very small radio-palmar branch, and being prolonged so as to constitute the common trunk of the internal col- lateral artery of the thumb and the external collateral artery of the index finger; or else it terminates in the external collateral of that finger; or, lastly, after having given off the internal collateral of the thumb and the ex- ternal collateral of the fore-finger, it ends in the external collateral of the thumb. At other times, again, there is no superficial palmar arch properly so called, and the ulnar artery terminates by furnishing the collaterals of the little and ring fingers and the internal collateral of the middle finger, the other collaterals being derived from the radio-palmar, which is then very large. In certain cases, a very small transverse branch forms the communi- cation between the radial and the ulnar arteries. General Remarks on the Arteries of the Upper Extremity. A single trunk, which may be called the brachial trunk, supplies the whole of the upper extremity; it forms, in succession, the subclavian, the axillary, and the brachial artery, which latter bifurcates near the bend of the elbow into the radial and ulnar arteries : these form the palmar arches, from which the ar- teries of the fingers take their origin. The difference in the origin of the right and left brachial trunks has been considered to account for the difference in strength between the two arms; and the different size of the two vessels has also been supposed to be connected with the same fact, which however, in reality, depends upon the more frequent exercise of the right than of the left arm. The brachial trimk is not exclusively distributed to the upper extremity, but suppUes the most dissimilar parts; a fact which shows that the conditions of origin, which have so great an influence in regard to nerves, are altogether without importance in reference to the arteries. Thus, the brachial trimk sends branches to the following parts -.—the vertebral artery to the brain, the cerebellum, the pons varolii, the medulla oblongata, and the spmal cord; the m-

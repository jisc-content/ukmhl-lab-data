ANGEIOLOGY. 748 I have seen an inferior perforating artery arise from the femoral just where it passed through the tendon of the adductor magnus. The terminal branch (d',fig. 214.) of the deep femoral constitutes the last perforating artery, â– which is distributed in the same manner as the other arteries of that name. The Popliteal Artery. When the femoral artery has perforated the tendinous portion of the ad- ductor magnus, it takes the name of the popliteal artery, which extends down to its division into the anterior tibial and tibio-peroneal arteries. The popliteal artery (o,Jigs. 215. 217.) is the artery of the ham or popliteal Fig "15 space : it is bounded above (j),Jig. 215.) by the tendinous ring formed in the adductor magnus, and below (j),fig. 217.) by the lower border of the popliteus muscle; at which place it is situated opposite the lower end of the upper fourth of the leg. Its length in an adult sub- ject is about seven inches. It passes vertically, or somewhat obliquely outwards and downwards, the direction of the artery being represented by a line extending from the inner surface of the femur to the space between its two condyles. It is tortuous when the leg is flexed upon the thigh, but it becomes straight when the leg is extended, and may be ruptured by very forcible exten- sion. It has been proved by experiment, that extension may be carried as far as to cause laceration of the ligaments of the joint, without rupturing the artery. Relations. It is situated deeply in the whole of its course, and it is in relation, behind, with the semi-membranosus above; lower down, with the popliteal fascia, from which it is se- parated by a layer of fat of greater or less thickness according to the prominence of the ham-string muscles ; below this, with the gas- trocnemius and plantaris muscles; and still lower, with the soleus. The popliteal vein lies behind and slightly to the outer side of the ar- tery and then behind it, adhering rather firmly to it. The internal popliteal nerve also lies upon it behind, but is separated from it by a very thick layer of fat. The veins and nerves both cross the artery beneath the gastrocne- mius, so as to get to the inner side of the lower portion of the vessel. From these relations it follows, that the po- pliteal artery may be exposed from behind in the whole of its extent, but nuf: {i?hthe Internal s-fa^e of the femur, w^^^^^^^ become posterior, so as to ^^Pf^^'-.^^ff'll Jfeus^m^^^^ The direct which it is in direct cof a J^^^^^^^^^ ,.,ieh tX"^'^^^^^-- ^Va^eurl^m^^^^^^^ change, and accounts for the frequency of aneurism m this region.

ANTERIOR BRANCHES OF THE DORSAL NERVES. 1065 mamma in the female. The perforating hranches of the fourth and fifth dorsal nerves each give a branch to the mamma, and a posterior branch, which crosses the latissimus dorsi, and is distributed to the skin over tj^^ scapula; the skm of the mamma receives nerves from the third, fourth and fifth dorsal nerves The eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh dorsal nerves belong to the intercostal spaces formed by the false ribs : they leave those spaces at the point where the costal cartilages change their direction to bend upwards ; they perforate the costal attachments of the diaphragm, without giving that muscle any fila- ments, continue their oblique course in the substance of the parietes of the ab- domen, for which they are destined, and are distributed to these parts, in the same way as the nerves in the intercostal spaces, with some slight modifications. Thus, the perforating branches perforate the external intercostals and the obliquus externus abdominis in the same line as the perforating branches of the preceding nerves; the intercostal branches, properly so called, having thus become abdoininal, run between the external and internal oblique muscles, just as, in the upper spaces, they ran between the external and internal intercostals. Having reached the rectus abdominis, they give off a cutaneous or perforating branch, and then enter the sheath of that muscle, through certain openings at its outer border, and proceed between the muscle and the posterior layer of the sheath: at the junction of the two external thirds with the internal third of the rectus, these branches pass through it very obliquely towards the middle line, and divide into muscular filaments, which are lost in the muscle, and the lowest of which pass vertically downwards, and cutaneous filaments, which per- forate the anterior layer of the sheath of the rectus, on each side of the linea alba, but not always at the same distance from it, and are reflected horizon- tally outwards in the subcutaneous cellular tissue lying immediately in con- tact with the skin. The twelfth dorsal nerve (d, fig. 290.) might, according to the opinion of Haller, be regarded as the first lumbar nerve. It is larger than the other dorsal nerves; it emerges from the vertebral canal between the last rib and the first lumbar vertebra, passes in front of the costal attachments of the quad- ratus lumborum, runs along the lower border of the twelfth rib, proceeds very obliquely downwards like that rib, perforates the aponeurosis of the trans- versalis muscle, and, like the preceding nerves, divides almost immediately into two branches. The abdominal branch, which corresponds to the intercostal branch of the other nerves, passes horizontally forwards between the trans- versalis and obliquus intemus supplying those muscles, almost always gives oS below an anastomotic branch to the abdominal or Uio-inguinal branch of the lumbar plexus, and then penetrates the sheath of the rectus, where it is arranged like the preceding nerves. The perforating or cutaneous branch is remarkable for being larger than the abdominal branch, and for its distribution ; it perforates very obliquely, and at the same time gives branches to the external and internal oblique muscles, becomes subcutaneous, passes vertically downwards, crosses at right angles over the crest of the ilium, and divides into anterior, posterior, and middle branches, which are distributed to the skin of the gluteal region. Not unfrequently this gluteal cutaneous branch is given off by the first lumbar nerve, and then the cutaneous branch of the twelfth dorsal nerve is arranged like those of the preceding nerves, and ramifies in the skin between the last rib and the crest of the ilium. There is a mutual relationship between the twelfth dorsal and the first lumbar nerves, so that they are often inversely developed; they always communicate with each other by a branch called the dorsi-lumbar, but the mode and place of communication are subject to many varieties : thus it is sometimes effected by a winding branch which runs along the outer border of the quadratus lumborum, at other times it takes place in the substance of the abdominal muscles.* Â» In a subject which had !i tliirtopiitli or liimb.ir rib, there was a thirteenth dorsal nerve of large size, which crossed the supornuracrary rib, and which corresponded in its distriliutlon

THE CAROTID AND VISCERAL BRANCHES. 1151 From the inner border of the same ganglion other branches proceed, whicli embrace the external carotid and the ramifications of that vessel. These nerves are of a grey colour (subruji), of a soft texture (nervi molles et pene mucosi, Scarpa), and of a knotted and gangliform structure (rami gangliformes, Neubauer) ; they come off from the ganglion opposite to the origin of the facial artery ; they pass inWards behind the external and internal carotids, and form a sort of grey plexus which extends as far as the origin of the internal and external carotid * ; they turn like a loop around the former of these vessels and anastomose with the carotid filaments from the glosso- pharyngeal, and from the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric. None of the branches from this plexus are prolonged upon the common carotid; they all pass upon the external carotid and its different ramifications, forming as many plexuses as there are vessels, and are dis- tributed with those vessels to the neck and the face. Thus, there is a thyroid plexus which surrounds the superior thyroid artery, and may be traced into the thyroid body; a lingual plexus which enters the substance of the tongue, and is supposed to anastomose with the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth, and even with the hypo-glossal nerve ; and a facial plexus which is supposed to anastomose with the facial nerve. Anatomists have particularly directed their attention to the branches which enter the sub- maxillary gland; some imagining, and others regarding it as certain, that these branches communicate with the submaxillary ganglion. I have never been fortunate enough to discover this communication. There is moreover a pharyngeal plexus, an occipital plexus, and an auri- cular plexus: the elder Meckel f has even described an anastomosis between the facial nerve and the sympathetic filament which accompanies the poste- rior auricular artery. Lastly, the temporal artery, and the internal maxiUary artery and its divisions, are also surrounded (hederse ad modum, Scarpa) by small nervous plexuses; these plexuses are sometimes so well developed, that the elder Meckel states that the arteries of the face have larger nervous plexuses than any others in the body. These plexuses appear to me to be peculiarly- remarkable for containing a mixture of white fibres and nervi molles, which proves their double origin. All these plexuses present gangliform enlargements at various points, as is shewn in the splendid plate in Scarpa's work. J This author has figured after Andersh a ganglion which he believes to be constant at the division of the external carotid and temporal arteries. A twig from the facial nerve ter- minates in this ganglion.ยง The visceral branches. All these come off from the inner side of the gan- glion, and divide into pharyngeal, laryngeal, and cardiac branches. The pharyngeal branches are certain thick ganglionic cords which arise from the upper and inner part of the superior cervical ganglion, pass transversely inwards, and combine with the pharyngeal branches of the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves to form one of the most remarkable plexuses in the body, which is distributed to the pharynx. To this plexus must be referred all those highly important nervous phenomena which are manifested in con- nexion with the pharynx, more particularly the sensation of thirst. The laryngeal branches unite with the superior laryngeal nerve and its divi- โข At this division there is frequently a gangliform enlargement, which Arnold proposes to call the inler-carottd ganglion. t Mcmoires de 1' Acad, de Berlin, 1752. X Tabulie Neurologicse, tab. iii. 1794. ยง Arnold has described and figured a twig from the plexus which surrounds the middle me nineeal or spheno-spinous artery, and which, according to this laborious inquirer, terminates m the otic ganglion ; he .ilso describes some nervous twigs, passing from the plexus of the as cending palatine artery to the submaxillary ganglion. In this way he establishes a connexion between the sympathetic system and these two cranial ganglia. I have devoted ereat care tn this subject, but have never been able to make out these communicating filaments even thmlZ nitrlcacid "^"^ o'S'^ctions have been made upon specimens previously macerated in diluted vol,. 11.

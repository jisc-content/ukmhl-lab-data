INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PLANTAR ARTERIES. 757 and the abductor of the Uttle toe, it turns directly forwards and having reached tL^der su face of the posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone it changes its direction, leaves the nerve, and curves inwards and forwards, towafds the posterior extremity of the first interosseous space (at y) where it nrculates with the dorsal artery of the foot: this curved portion of the artery, extending from the fourth to the first interosseous space, constitutes the plantar arcrwhich is formed by the junction of the dorsal artery of the foot with the external plantar artery ; it runs obliquely below the posterior extremities, or sometimes the middle of the metatarsal bones, between them and the adductor of the ereat toe, by which, and all the other muscles of the middle plantar reeion it is covered in below; and it establishes a free and uninterrupted com- munication between the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. I have seen the plantar arch formed exclusively by the dorsal artery of the foot, the ex- ternal plantar being very small, and losing itself in the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti; at other times, the external plantar artery only com- municates with the plantar arch by means of some small branches. Before it constitutes the plantar arch, the external plantar artery gives off an inferior calcaneal branch (c), which passes transversely outwards, in front of the tubercles on the lower surface of the os calcis, above the flexor brevis digitorum, and terminates in the muscles of the external plantar region ; also some muscular branches to the muscles of the external plantar region, the flexor brevis digitorum, and the flexor accessorius; and lastly, some periosteal, osseous, and articular branches, to the bones and to the corresponding articu- lations of the tarsus. The plantar arch itself gives off superior and anterior branches. The superior branches, or the posterior perforating arteries, pass perpendicularly up- wards, through the posterior extremities of the interosseous spaces, and anas- tomose with the dorsal interosseous arteries. There are only three posterior perforating arteries, which belong to the second, third, and fourth (d) inter- osseous spaces: the dorsal artery of the foot represents the perforating artery of the first interosseous space. The anterior branches are five in number; of these, four are plantar inter- osseous or digital arteries, and are distinguished by the numerical names of first, second, and third, proceeding from within outwards; the fifth anterior branch is the external collateral artery of the little toe. All the plantar Interosseous or digital arteries (e) run forwards in the cor- responding interosseous spaces, and then between two of the metatarso-phalan- gal articulations; opposite the anterior extremity of the metatarsal bone, each digital artery gives off a small anterior perforating branch (as at Â«), which anastomoses with the corresponding dorsal interosseous artery; having reached beyond the posterior extremity of the first phalanges of the toes on either side, each digital artery divides into two branches, which constitute the internal and external collateral arteries (/) of the corresponding toes, and are distributed in precisely the same manner as the collateral arteries of the fingers; that is to say, the internal and external collaterals of each toe anastomose by a small transverse branch opposite the second phalanx, anastomose again opposite the middle of the last phalanx, and are almost entirely distributed to the skin. The first plantar interosseous or digital artery (arteria magna pollicis pedis) requires a special description. It is very large, and arises precisely at the point (_g) where the dorsal artery of the foot terminates in the plantar arch, so that it appears to result from the bifurcation of the dorsal artery of the foot; it passes under the first metatarsal bone, and having arrived behind the anterior ex- tremity of that bone, it gives ofi' a branch from its inner side, which sometimes forms the internal collateral artery of the great toe ; it then passes outwards to reach the space between the metatarso-phalangal articulations of the first and second toes, and divides into the external collateral artery of the great toe (A) and the internal collateral artery of the second toe (/). Opposite the middle of the first phalanx of the great toe, its external collateral artery gives off -a, I 4

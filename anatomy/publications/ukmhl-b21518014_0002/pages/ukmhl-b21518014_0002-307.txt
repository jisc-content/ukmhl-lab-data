THE SPINAL CORD DEPRIVED OF ITS NEURILEMMA. 931 U 3 nutritious vessels of that organ ; in this latter respect it has been compared to the pia mater of the brain. The transi- tion from the spinal into the cerebral portion of the pia mater takes place gra- dually. The fibrous character of this tunic diminishes upon the medulla ob- longata, and tuber annulare, and is en- tirely lost opposite the peduncles of the brain; whilst its vascular character, on the contrary, becomes gradually more and more marked as it passes from the cord towards the brain. It has been stated, the neurilemma is the secreting organ of the spinal cord; one might as well say, that the testicle is secreted by the tunica albuginea, and the heart by the pericardium. The Body of the Spinal Cord de- prived of its Neurilemma. When the neurilemma of the cord is removed, the spinal nerves are also taken away. We shall hereafter have to in- quire, whether this fact should lead us to conclude, that the nerves do not enter into the substance of the cord, but merely come into contact with it. We would observe, however, in this place, that the posterior roots of the spinal nerves arise in a perfectly regular line, whilst the anterior roots come oflf irregularly from different points of the corresponding medullary column. * The anterior median groove, and the commissure. The anterior median groove, or fissure(^5-. 268.;/, fig. 269. D), pene- trates to about one-third of the thick- ness of the cord. At the bottom of the groove, which is occupied by a prolong- ation of the neurilemma and a great number of vessels, is seen an extremely thin white layer, perforated with forami- na, which is named the anterior commis- sure (commissure longitudinale, Chaus- sier). The foramina in this structure are intended for the transmission of tufts of vessels, which enter the substance of the cord. The alternate arrangement of these foramina greatly increases the difficulty of drawing out the vessels, and gives to the commissure the appearance of being formed by interlacing fibres; or*nc™rn1nfam°"^p^o7hU 'periolrVho" trl^rf "^"^ ^'■^V"^f '"'"^ ''"f^ formed of grey substance.

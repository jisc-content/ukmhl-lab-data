CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES AND OLFACTORY LOBES. 1015 specting the encephalon of vertebrate animals, we may regard the different pairs of lobes of the encephalon as so many pairs of ganglia situated upon the pro- longation of the spinal cord ; these he names ganglions sans appareil exterieur. The first or the most anterior pair consists of the olfactory lobes which are rudimentary in man. The second is the cerebrum properly so called. The third is formed by the tubercula quadrigemina or optic lobes which are rudimentary in man. The fourth is the cerebellum. The ganglia which constitute each pair communicate with each other; each ganglion commu- nicates with that which precedes and that which follows it; and lastly, they aU communicate with the spinal cord.* â™¦ [There is still considerable uncertainty as to the parts of the encephalon which correspond in tlie higher and lower vertebrata.

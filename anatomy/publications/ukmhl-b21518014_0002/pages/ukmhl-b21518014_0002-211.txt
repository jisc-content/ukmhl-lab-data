835 THE LYMPHATICS OF THE TRUNK. o 3 and terminate in the axillary glands. I have seen some of the deep lymphatics of the forearm communicate at the bend of the elbow with the superficial lymphatics on the outer part of the back of the arm, and enter the glands above the epitrochlea. The lymphatic vessels of the upper half of the trunk. We have seen that all the lymphatics of the sub-umbilical portion of the trunk enter the inguinal glands ; and so all the lymphatic vessels of the supra-umbUical portion termi- nate in the axilla. The anterior and lateral lymphatics pass upwards upon the pectoralis major and the serratus magnus, to gain the axilla. The posterior lymphatics are divided into those of the neck and those of the back; the posterior cervical lymphatics descend upon the trapezius and the del- toid, and are reflected over the posterior border of the last-named muscle, in order to reach the cavity of the axilla ; the posterior dorsal lymphatics run in different directions, some horizontally, the others from below upwards to be reflected into the axilla below the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major.

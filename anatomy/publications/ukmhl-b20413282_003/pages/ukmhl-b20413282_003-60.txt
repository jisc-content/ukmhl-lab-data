170 DISSECTION OF THE SUBCLAVIAN EEGION". 3. The internal jnaimnary, 7i, arises opposite the vertebral an( beneath the jngnlar vein: it enters the thorax through the iippe opening, and is continued to the wall of the abdomen. 4. The supeiHor intercostal (intercosto-cervical) arises under thj scalenus: it supplies offsets to the upper two intercostal spaces' and a large branch to the back of the neck (deep cervical), whicl is delineated in Plate xix. I SUBCLAVIAN AND JUGULAR VEINS. ; The veins of the arm and of the same side of the neck mee at the top of the thorax, and blend in one large trunkâ€”the inno minate: the limb vein is called subclavian, and the neck vein jugular. p. Subclavian vein, r. Internal jugular rein, s. External jugular vein. The subclavian vein, 2h is rather shorter than its correspondin: artery, and ends near the inner border of the scalenus by joinin the internal jugular to form the innominate trunk. Arched lik the artery, it is placed in front of the scalenus, and commonl below the level of the clavicle. Valves exist in the trunk outsid the place of entrance of the external jugular, s. The veins joining it are the external and anterior jugula and the vertebral. At the back of the vein, near the intern jugular, the right lymphatic duct opens; and at a similar sp( on the left side the thoracic duct is received. External and anterior jugular veins. The ending of these veil is seen in this Plate, and their course is described in p. 143. Ti external jugular, i^receives the transverse cervical branch, t, ai the supra-scapular, and joins the subclavian vein outside tl scalenus anticus. The anterior jugular, v, enters either the su clavian vein or the external jugular: when this vein is tributai to the external jugular it wants valves (Struthers). Internal jugular vei7i, r.

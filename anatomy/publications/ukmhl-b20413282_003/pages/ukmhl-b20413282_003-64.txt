DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. 174 This muscle extends the head, and brings the face to its own side by moving the atlas round tiie odontoid process of the axis. Rectus posticus minor, H, arises from the arch of the atlas, close to the middle line; and is inserted into the inner half ol the lower curved line of the occipital bone. The muscle extends the head. \ ARTERIES OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. Three arteries supply the back of the neck, and connect the vessels of the head with those of the trunk. In the neighbour- hood of the thorax small offsets of the dorsal arteries appear. a. Occipital artery. h. Deep cervical branch of the occi- pital. c. Ofl'set to the small rectus muscle. cl. Vertebral artery. e. Cervical branch of the vertebral. /. Anastomosis of the vertebral anc deep cervical arteries. g. Deep cervical artery. h. Dorsal arteries â€” the innei branches. The occipital artery, a, courses to the integuments of the bad of the head over the obliquus superior and the complexus, anc beneath the sterno-mastoideus, the splenius, and the trachelo mastoideus : near the middle line it pierces the trapezius. It furnishes a cervical branch, to the neck (ram. princen cervicis), which descends beneath the complexus, B, supplying the deep muscles, and anastomoses with branches of the vertebra and deep cervical arteries. An offset passes over the complexus and supplies the superficial muscles. The vertehral artery, d, in its course to the interior of th skull is directed backwards in a groove on the neural arch of th atlas. Lying deeply in the bottom of the hollow between th large rectus and the oblique muscles, it furnishes one or tw muscular offsets, e, and communicates with the contiguou arteries. The deep cervical artery, g, is the dorsal offset of the uppe intercostal (p. 170), and reaches the back of the neck by passin

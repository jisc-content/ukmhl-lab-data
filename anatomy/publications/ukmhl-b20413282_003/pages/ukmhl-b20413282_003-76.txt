DESCRIPTIOX OF PLATE XXIL The dissection of the submaxillaiy region is indicated in thisj Figure. The steps of the dissection are the following :â€”The soft par over the jaw are to be divided, and the bone is to be sawn through rather on the right of the symphysis ; then, the tongue having been drawn out of the mouth, the mucous membrane is to be cut along it below, to trace forwards the vessels and nerves. ' To make tense the muscles, fasten down the os hyoides with a stitch to one of the firm surrounding parts. ' MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE AND THE HYOID BONE. Extrinsic muscles of the tongue and elevators of the os hyoides occupy the interval between the tongue and that bone. A. Mylo-liyoideus, reflected. B. Geuio-liyoideus. C. Genio-glossus. D. Hyo-glossus. E. Stylo-glossus. F. Stylo-hyoideus. G. Middle constrictor. H. Diffastricus. J. Inferior constrictor. K. Thyro-liyoideus. L. Omo-hyoideus. N. Sterno-liyoideus. 0. Stylo-hyoid ligament. P. Great cornu of the hyoid bone. Q. Thyroid cartilage. Elevators of the os hyoides. Some of the muscles of this group viz., the mylo-hyoideus. A, the stylo-hyoideus, F, and the digas tricus, fi, have been described (p. 157): the remaining elevator given below. . ;:^U^v-^ Genio-hyoideus, B. It arises from an eminenee inside th symphysis of the jaw, and is inserted below into the centre c the body of the hyoid bone. The muscle touches its fellow alonj the middle line, and lies between the genio-glossus, C, and th mylo-hyoideuSj A. When the mouth is shut the muscle will raise the hyoid bone

214 DISSECTION OF THE PHxiRYNX. i cells, and bodies like free nuclei. The capsules do not appear to have any apertures, MUSCLES OF THE SOFT PALATE, ' The muscles of the soft palate act as elevators and depressors, They are four in number on each side; and along the centre lies a thin fleshy slip, which is connected with the uvula. G. Levator palati muscle. K. Superficial part of the pa H. Tensor palati muscle. lato-pharyugeus. J. Azj'gos uvulse muscle. L. Deep part ot" the palato pharyngeus. The elevator muscles, two in number on each side, G and H descend from the base of the skull, and enter the soft palate ai their lower ends. The levator jmlati, G, arises from the under surface of the ape] of the temporal bone, and from the hinder part of the cartilage o the Eustachian tube ; entering the pharynx above the uppe: constrictor (Plate xxiv.) it spreads out in the soft palate, forming a fleshy layer from the attached to the free edge, and unites witl its fellow along the middle line. The muscle contracting carries backwards and upwards th« soft palate, placing this in a more horizontal position, and ap proaching the free edge and the uvula to the back of th pharynx. By that movement the part of the pharynx leading to the nose is much diminished ; and if the upper constricto muscle contracts at the same time the passage may be closed. The tensor vel circumflexus palati, H, has a thin but wide origi from the skull, and from the fore part of the cartilage of th Eustachian tube — the cranial attachment reaching from th navicular fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid pl^te to th styloid process. Descending along the inner pterygoid plate, th muscle enters the pharynx between two points of attachment c the buccinator muscle (Plate xxiv.) and becoming tendinouj turns round the hamular process to be inserted partly into th OS palati, and partly into the aponeurosis of the palate beneat

146 DISSECTION OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. The nerve to the rhomloid muscle, 7, pierces the fibres of t scalenus medius, and is inclined backwards beneath the elevat of the angle of the scapula. Nerve to the serratus magnus, 8, (posterior thoracic). Tl nerve issues through the scalenus medius, below the precedir and is continued beneath the cords of the plexus to the axil See Plate ii., 5. The nerve to the subdavius, 10, passes in front of the subclavi artery to the under surface of its muscle. The supra-scapular nerve, 12, accompanies the omo-hy( muscle to the back of the scapula, and supplies the supra a infra-spinate muscles, the shoulder-joint, and the blade bone. The two remaining nerves, which are seen in this part of t neck, belong to the cranial set. \ The spinal accessory nerve, 13, (eleventh cranial) pierces 1 sterno-mastoideus, and ends in the trapezius, after crossing 1 posterior triangular space, where it joins the spinal nerv Under the trapezius it communicates with the nerve marked, before it enters the fleshy mass. The posterior auricular, 14, a branch of the facial or sevei cranial nerve, ascends in front of the mastoid process, and be joined by the great auricular nerve, splits into two vâ€”one pi belongs to the integuments of the back of the ear, and retrahent muscle of the pinna ; and the other supplies the hin belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle, and the integument c tiguous to it. Lymphatics. Beneath the fascia lies a collection of cerv: lymphatic glands in the clavicular part of the posterior trian They communicate below with the lymphatics of the axilla; above with those about the ear and the occiput, by means of superficial lymphatic vessels and glands accompanying the exte: jugular vein. Beneath the sterno-mastoideus they join also deep glands by the side of the carotid vessels.

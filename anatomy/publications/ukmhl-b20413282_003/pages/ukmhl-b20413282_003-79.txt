NERVES OF THE TONGUE. 189 a. Common carotid trunk. h. External carotid artery. c. Upper thyroid branch. d. Lingual artery. e. Ranine branch. /. Sublingual branch. g. Facial artery, cut. h. Occipital artery. i. Branch of the sublingual artery. I. Internal jugular vein. The li7igual artery, d, springing from the external carotid, runs ibliquely upwards beneath the hyo-glossus to the under surface iiti^of the tongue, where it takes the name ranine, and continues along the middle line to the tipâ€”distributing offsets. Near the front of the tongue the arteries of opposite sides correspond with the frasnura linguae in position, and may be cut when that fold of the mucous membrane is snipped with a scissors in tongue-tied )aroti^nfants. A few named branches come from the artery: the most un- important is the hyoid branch, which supplies one or more of the muscles attached to the os hyoides. Beneath the hyo-glossus a dorsal lingual branch takes its origin. And at the fore part of that muscle arises the sublingual branch, /, which supplies the gland of the same name and the contiguous muscles, and joins the artery of the opposite side by means of the twig, i. Lingual vetfi^Ity'"anatomy is similar to that of the artery, and it ends in the internal jugular vein. NERVES OF THE TONGUE. Six large nerves end in the tongue, three in each half; and the three of the right side are delineated as they course through the submaxillary region. 5. Gustatory nerve. 6. Submaxillary ganglion. 7. Loop between the gustatory and hypoglossal nerves. :excii incli lifloi 1. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 2. Hypoglossal nerve. 3. Descendens noni branch. 4. Upper laryngeal nerve. The hypoglossal nerve, 2 (twelfth cranial, Plate xxiv.), is the motor nerve of the tongue. Coursing with the lingual artery as far as the hyo-glossus it passes over this muscle, and enters the fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus, in which it is continued to the

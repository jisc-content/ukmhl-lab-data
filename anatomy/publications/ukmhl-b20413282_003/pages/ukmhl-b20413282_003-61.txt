NERVES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN REGION. 171 laid bare. Before its junction with the subclavian it is narrowed, and at the less wide part is a pair of valves to prevent the blood rushing backwards to the neck.* The innominate is the large venous trunk formed by the union of the subclavian and internal jugular veins: it enters the chest, and joins with its fellow in the upper cava. The connections ot the vein in the neck may be studied in the Figure. NERVES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN REGION. > Most of the nerves are continued to distant parts, only two being distributed to the neighbouring muscles. 1. Great auricular nerve. 2. Superficial cervical nerve. 3. Phrenic nerve. 4. Descendens noni nerve. 5. Fifth cervical nerve. 6. Sixth cervical nerve. 7. Seventh cervical nerve. 8. Eighth cervical nerve, 9. Supra-scapular nerve. 10. Vagus nerve. t Nerve to the suhclavius. The diaphragmatic (phrenic) nerve, 3, springs from the fourth spinal nerve in the cervical plexus, and is sometimes connected with the fifth spinal as it passes by that trunk. In the neck it courses over the anterior scalenus muscle, crossing from the outer to the inner edge; and entering the chest beneath the innominate vein, it is transmitted through that cavity to the diaphragm. It is the motor nerve of the diaphragm. Descendens noni nerve, 4. For the beginning of this branch of the hypoglossal, see Plate xvii. At the lower part of the neck it ends in branches for the sterno-hyoideus, G, sterno-thyroideus, H, and the posterior belly of the omo-hyoideus, D, as well as the anterior belly of the same muscle. Brachial plexus. The lower four cervical nerves, 5, C, 7, 8, join with the first dorsal to form the plexus. The branches of the plexus above the clavicle are enumerated in p. 146; but only * These valves were first described by Dr. Struthers. See an account of hem in the Edinb. Med. Journal for Nov. 1856, p. 241.

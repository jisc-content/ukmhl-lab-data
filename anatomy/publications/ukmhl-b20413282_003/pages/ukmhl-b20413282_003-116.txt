226 DISSECTION OF THE LAEYNX. • i Figure I.—For this Drawing the dissection was prepared by; remoYing the greater part of the right half of the thyroid carti-: lage, and then taking the areolar tissue from the subjacent muscles,,; vessels, and nerves. Some nerves which enter the mucous mem-: brane behind the larynx from both laryngeal trunks could not b^ preserved. On the right side of the tongue the extrinsic muscles have been defined as they enter it. In this, as in the other Figures, the hyoid bone, the cartilages of the larynx with some ligaments, and the trachea and the thyroid body are depicted. A. Os hyoides. B. Thyroid cartilage, C. Cricoid cartilage. D. Trachea. E. The tongue. F. Palato-glossus mnscle. G. Stylo-glossus. H. Pharyngeo-glossus. I. Cornicula laryngis. J. Crico-thyroid membrane. K. Hyo-glossus muscle. L.

Some of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles act more immediate!} on the arytasnoid cartilages, approximating them to, or removinj. them from each other, and control the width of the glottis Others make tense or lax the vocal cords, and so govern the pitcl of the voice. One pair of muscles depresses the epiglottis. 0, Depressor of the epiglottis. P. Thyro-arytsenoideus. Q. Crico arytsenoideus lateralis. P. Crico-arytsenoideus posticus V. Arytfenoideus. Y. Crico-thyroideus, cut. Muscles governing the size of the glottis.—The interval betwee: the vocal cords can be widened or narrowed by the three foUowin muscles.

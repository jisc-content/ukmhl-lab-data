In the produc- tion of very deep notes the muscles draw down the epiglottis over the aperture of the larynx. NERVES OF THE LARYNX. There are two laryngeal nerves on each side, the superior and inferior. One is supplied nearly altogether to the mucous mem- brane, and the other chiefly to muscles. 1. Upper laryngeal nerve. 2. Branches to the mucous mem- brane of the larynx. 3. Branch for the arytaenoideus. 4. Branch to join inferior laryn- geal. 5. Inferior laryngeal or recur- rent nerve. 6. Branch to join upper laryn- geal. 7. Branch to muscles. 8. Hypoglossal nerve. 9. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 10. Gustatory nerve. The up;per laryngeal nerve, 1, pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane, and divides into branches. From the branch, 2, offsets are dis- tributed to the root of the tongue, and to the mucous membrane of the larynx; between the border of the epiglottis and the true vocal cord, one or two pierce thÂ®. depressor of the epiglottis. The branch 3 enters the arytasnoideus muscle, Y, and supplying it, passes through to the mucous lining of the larynx. Fi'om the branch, 4, offsets are furnished to the pharyngeal mucous mem- brane; and this joins finally the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Before the nerve enters the larynx it gives off high in the neck the external laryngeal branch (Plate xxiv. 4), which ends in the crico-thyroideus muscle, Y, supplying it entirely. The upper laryngeal is the sensory nerve dt' the mucous mem- * Description of the sacculus or pouch in the human larynx. By Mr. John Hilton. Guy's Hospital Reports, vol. 2. Lond. 1837, p. 519.

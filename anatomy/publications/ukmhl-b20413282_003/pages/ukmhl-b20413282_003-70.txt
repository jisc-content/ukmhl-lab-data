180 DISSECTION OF THE PTEEYGOID REGION. ceding, and is concealed by the external pterygoid : it isdelineatec in Plate xxi., 1. -i ^ u A^„fo A third small artery, /, which has not been described by Anato mists, runs with the gustatory nerve, and supplies the cheek, an. the floor of the mouth external to the tongue. The second set of hranches is distributed to the muscles of mai tication as below :— ^ i,- ;i The deep temporal, g, two in number, enter the fore and hmd. parts of their muscle. The masseteric branch, s, sprmgs m coii mon with the posterior temporal, and enters the hinder border the masseter: it has been cut in the removal of the muscle. T luccal branch, h, descends to the cheek and the buccinator muscl it anastomoses with the facial artery. Branches to the pterygo muscle are shown in Plate xxi. Thifrd set of branches. Only one of these branches, the poster, dental, h, is seen in the dissection. It takes a tortuous course the front of the upper jaw, where it communicates with the mf orbital: it will be given more fully in Plate xxiii. llh^ facial artery, n, also a branch of the external carotid (PI xvii.), is displayed as it crosses the jaw. It ascends with a m course to the root of the nose, passing near the corner of mouth. . f i\ Named branches supply the lips and the nose, and one ot tl^ to the lower part of the face is the inferior labial, r. Unnar branches ramify in the cheek, and anastomose with the buccal transverse facial arteries.

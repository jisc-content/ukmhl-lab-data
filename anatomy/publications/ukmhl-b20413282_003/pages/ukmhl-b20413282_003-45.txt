MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. 155 Superficial to the sheath of the vessels where the common carotid may be tied, is the descendens noni nerve, 3. A little above the hyoid bone the hypoglossal nerve, 14, is directed for- wards over both carotid arteries; and in front of the ear the branches of the facial nerve, 4, cross over the external carotid. On a line with the base of the jaw-bone the glosso-pharyngeal nfvrvp ij^ inclined inwards between both arteries. In the sheath, between and parallel with the vein and artery, the vagus nerve extends through the neck (Plate xxiv.); two of its branches, the superior laryngeal, 1, and the external laryngeal, ^, being directed inwards to the larynx. Beneath the sheath the cord of the sympathetic nerve (Plate xxiv.) rests on the spinal column. External or posterior to the sheath for a short distance is the spinal accessory nerve, 13, as this issues from beneath the digas- tric muscle, R. One small nerve is altogether removed from the sheath: it is the mylo-hyoid branch, 12, of the inferior maxillary nerve (Plate xxi.), and escapes from under the jaw-bone. Glands of the space. Two large salivary glands, the parotid and submaxillary, which are seen in Plate xvi., where they are marked L and R, occupy the base of the triangular space. The lymphatic glands have been cleared away in the dissection: one set lies along the jaw-bone (Plate xvi.); and the other (deep cervical) is placed along the side of the jugular vein, under the sterno-mastoideus. MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. The muscles occupying the upper and fore parts of the trian- gular space converge to the os hyoides—the upper set elevating, and the lower set depressing that bone.

152 DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK, ; The anatomy of the several arteries will be given with tb description of Plate xviL SUFEFvFICIAL VEINS OF THE NECK. Two superficial jugular veins, and the facial and lingual vein^ appear in this dissection. \ h. External jugular vein. 1 n. Facial vein. ' I. Anterior jugular vein. I : The external jugular vein, Ii, is figured in the part of its cours which is superficial to the deep fascia of the neck, and is cor cealed by the platysma muscle, A, (p. 143). The anterior jugular vein, I, begins in the teguments below th chin, and communicates with a branch of the facial vein. Lyin superficially near the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoideus, i sinks through the cervical fascia near the sternum, and opens int the subclavian vein (Plate xviii.). It unites commonly by branch with the external jugular. CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. The facial nerve and branches of the cervical plexus suppi the superficial structures of the neck. 1. Cervical part of the facial nerve. I 3, Great auricular nerve. 2. Superficial cervical nerve. ! The infra-maxillary branch, 1, of the facial nerve, issuing fro beneath the parotid, sends forwards offsets beneath the platysn as low as the hyoid bone : it supplies that muscle and t] integuments. The superficial cervical nerve, 2, is bent forwards under t platysma, and its branches pierce the muscle to supply the integ ments between the hyoid bone and the sternum. Above, it jol the facial nerve : and it is said to give offsets to the lower part the platysma. The great auricular nerve, 3, ascends by the side of the e ternal jugular vein to the ear, and ends as before said (p. 145).

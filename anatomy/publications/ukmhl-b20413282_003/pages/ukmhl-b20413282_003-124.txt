DISSECTION OF THE J^OSE. 234 the sknll haying been previously detached for the dissection of j the pharynx. The nose was sawed through on the left of the septum for Figure ii.; and pieces of the middle and inferior spongy bones' were cut out to render evident the openings into the meatuses, i And for Figure iii. the mucous membrane was removed fromj the septum na<i, after the saw had been carried vertically through] the left nasal fossa. J BOUXDAEIES OF THE NASAL CAVITY. ^ Some of the boundaries appear in all the Figures, and the same letters of reference are used for them. A. Middle part of the roof of tlie nasal fossa. B. Fore part of the roof C. Back of the roof. D. Floor of the nasal cavity. E. Dilatation within the nostr^ / F. Upper spongy bone. ^'^i^T^ G. Middle spongy bone. H. Lower spougy bone. I. LTpper meatus of the nose. J. Middle meatus. K. Lower meatus. L. Sphenoidal sinus. M. Frontal sinus. Each half of the nose cavity is a flattened space, which com- municates with the face and the pharynx, and with the hollows or sinuses in the surrounding bones. It intervenes between the base of the skull and the mouth, and occupies the interval between the eye sockets. The bones of the face and skull enter into its construction ; and the boundaries are named roof and floor, inner and outer wall. The floor, D, is horizontal and smooth; and its bony fL*ame- work consists of the palate pieces of the upper maxillary and palate bones. The roof reaches from the nostril to the posterior naris, and is sloped before and behind. Its centre is formed by the thin cribriform plate of the ethmoid, A, and is nearly straight; the N. Funnel-shaped prominence of the ethmoid bone. 0. Aperture of the nasal duct. P. Opening of the Eustachian tub Q. Soft palate cut through. R. Descending plate of the ethmoid^ S. Vomer. T. Cartilage of the septum. U. Cartilage of the aperture. V. Pharynx. AV. Genio-hyo-glossus muscle. X. Epiglottis. Y. Os hyoides. Z. Thja-oid cartilage.

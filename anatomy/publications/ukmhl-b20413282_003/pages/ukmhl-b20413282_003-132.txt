DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. 2^10 surface amonf:^st the cells of the cpitliclinm * In their structi the nerve fibrils resemble the sympathetic more than other nerv for they are grannlar, and are provided with oval corpuscles wh i become visible on the addition of acetic acid. Upon tliis nerve the faculty of recognising odours depends, ordinary breathing, when the air traverses chiefly the lower h of the nasal cavity, faint odours fail to give indication of tli presence ; but if the air is cJirried upwards into the olfact< region by sniffing, the odorous particles diffused in the air will deto(!t(Hl, because they are brought more completely into cont; with the nerves. Touching the olfactory region with a solid bo* as with a probe, does not excite the sensation of smell.

The nasal nerve of the o])hthalmic trunk ramifies in the f ])art of the cavity from the roof to the nostril; and acts as t guardinn nerve of the anterior opening by endowing the pj referred to with great sensibility. Irritation of the anter; portion of the nasal cavity gives rise through this nerve to t reflex act of sneezing, with the view of dislodging the unusi stinuiliis by a strong current of air rapidly expelled. The spheno-palatine branches of tlie upper maxillary nei furnish oflsets through Meckel's ganglion to nil the remainder the cavity : these branches jinss for the most part through t s])heiio-p;iliiline fbriimon.

'II fati DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XYI. This Plate exhibits a surface-view of the side of the neck, in ont of a line from the mastoid process to the inner end of the avicle. Supposing the skin thrown aside as in the Figure, the thin eshy fibres of the platysma will appear through a slight fatty pvering, and may be readily cleaned. This muscle may be then lised towards the jaw by a cut over the sterno-mastoideus, the iperficial veins and nerves being traced out at the same time* efore the removal of the deep fascia the subjacent muscles nould be fixed in their natural position by stitches, to prevent leir slipping out of place when the investing sheaths are taken Afterwards the areolar tissue and fat are to be cleared out tween the jaw and the hyoid bone, and from the whole surface P the space laid bare. SURFACE VIEW OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. The prominent sterno-mastoid muscle, B, divides into two the de of the neck; and in front of it is a slight hollow, which is ost marked near the jaw, and is wider above than below. In front of the sterno-mastoideus lie the elevator and depressor uscles of the hyoid bone,â€”the former extending downwards om the lower jaw, and the latter reaching upwards from the lest and shoulder. Below the side of the jaw is the submaxillary gland, K, with a ain of small lymphatic glands reaching backwards to the irno-mastoid muscle ; and a lymphatic gland, with a small fcery entering it, is lodged just above the body of the hyoid I ne. Between the jaw and the ear the parotid gland, L, is idsed in.

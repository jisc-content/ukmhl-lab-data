176 DISSECTIOX OF THE PTEEYGOID REGION. and at the spines of the vertebra those that lie on the semi spinalis become cutaneous. They supply the complexus and th( muscles filling the yertebral grooye, with the interspinales. Th( following are the chief differences in these nerves:â€” The branch of the second nerve. 2. the largest of all, pierces th( complexus and trapezius, and becoming cutaneous is distributed t< the occiput: it is named great occijjital, and is joined bv the smal occipital nerve, 8. It supplies branches to the inferior oblique an( complexus muscles; and it communicates by loops with the firsi and third nerves. The cutaneous part of the third nerve, larger than those belo^p it, sends upwards a branch to the occiput, which joins the larg< occipital nerve. The connecting pieces between the inner branches of the firsi three nerves are sometimes absent. M. Cruveilhier describes thi: looped arrangement as the posterior cervical plexus. The small occipital nerve, 8, is an offset of the ceiwical plexu (Plate xv.): it ends in the integuments of the occiput, and join: the great occipital nerve. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XX. Ix this dissection of the pterygoid region the muscles of mast: cation, and the internal maxillary arteiy with its branches can b studied. Most of the branches of the inferior maxillary nerv come also into sight. This superficial dissection will be made by detaching an throwing down the zygomatic arch with the masseter muscle by sawing off and raising the coronoid process with the tempora muscle: and by removing the piece of the ramus of the ja\ between the condyle and the dental foramen. After each sawiuj of the bone the fat is to be carefully removed

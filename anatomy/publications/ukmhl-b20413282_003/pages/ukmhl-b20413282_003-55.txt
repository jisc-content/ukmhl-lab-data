NERVES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. 165 joins freely with the sensory fifth nerve, and furnishes offsets so to the integuments; and as it supplies alone the posterior illy of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoideus, it must confer on em sensibility as well as motion. The hypoglossal nerve, 14, is a motor nerve of the tongue, escending through the neck with the great bloodvessels till it mes below the digastric muscle, it is then directed forwards er the carotids to the submaxillary region: it will be continued Plate xxii. As it crosses the vessels it supplies two offsets :â€”one, descendens mi, 3, enters the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone, after ining with the spinal nerves (Plate xxiv.) ; the other, much laller, ends in the thyro-hyoideus, F. Branches of the vagus. Two branches of this nerve, viz., the per laryngeal, 1, and the external laryngeal, 2, (an offset of i|e first) are furnished to the larynx ; their distribution will be ferred to more fully in the description of the Plate of the ] :ynx. Branches of the fifth nerve. The auriculo-temjporal, 11, is a asory nerve, and ascends with the temporal artery to the side d top of the head : it supplies the ear with the attrahent iiiscle, and the parotid gland. The mylo-hyoid branch, 12, lies low the jaw, and ends in the anterior belly of the digastricus, d the mylo-hyoideus : contractility and sensibility are given to ose muscles by the nerve. The great auricular nerve, 10, of the cervical plexus is dis- lyed in Plate xvi. In this Figure the communicating branches, through the parotid to the facial nerve are brought into 3W. 'mi m

164 DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. in the base of the skull to the inner end of the clavicle, where joins the subclavian vein (Plate xviii.). In the neck it is \ companion vein to the common, and the internal carotid artei and it is joined by the veins corresponding with the branches the external carotid, with the exception of three which enter 1 external jugular. External jugular, r. The course and ending of this vein h{ been before described (p. 143). In the Drawing the beginning the vein by the union of the temporal and internal maxilli may be perceived : into the vein the posterior auricular branct received lower down. NERVES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. Several cranial nerves appear in the region dissected; a they are distributed to the face, the tongue, the windpipe, 8 the gullet. Only one spinal nerve is seen. 1. Upper laryngeal nerve. 2. External laryngeal nerve. 3. Descendens noni nerve. 4. Facial nerve. 6. Temporo-facial piece of the facial nerve. 6. Cervico-facial piece of the facial nerve, 7. Nerve to the digastric and stylo- hyoid muscles. 8. Posterior auricular nerve. 9. Branches of the great auric nerve joining the facial. 10. Great auricular nerve. 11. Auriculo-temporal branch of fifth nerve. 12. Mylo-hyoid branch of the nerve. 13. Spinal accessory nerve. 14. Hypoglossal nerve. The facial nerve, 4, issuing from the skull by the stylo-mas foramen, divides into two chief parts,â€”temporo-facial, 5, cervico-facial, 6 : these pass forwards through the parotid g to the forehead, the face, and the superficial parts of the nec] low as the hyoid bone. As soon as the nerve leaves its bony canal it gives off posterior auricular nerve, 8, and a muscular branch, 7, to posterior belly of the digastricus and to the stylo-hyoideus. It is chiefly a motor nerve ; and it gives the ability to coni to the superficial muscles of the head, ear, face, and i

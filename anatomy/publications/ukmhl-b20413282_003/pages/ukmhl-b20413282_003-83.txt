193 UPPER MAXILLARY NERVE. ;nd forwards over the upper maxilla to the front of the bone, and ''4 nastomoses with the infra-orbital artery. It supplies superficial and deep branches :—the former descend 0 the buccinator muscle, the periosteum, and the gums ; and .' he latter enter foramina in the bone, and supply offsets to the angs of the teeth and to the lining membrane of the antrum aaxillare. The infra-orlital artery, c, arises near the preceding, and enters 'i ^' he infra-orbital canal with the upper maxillary nerve. Con- inued through that canal, it issues at the infra-orbital foramen, w ,nd ends in branches for the lower eyelid and the parts between 'f he orbit and mouth : it communicates with the facial, transverse acial, and posterior dental arteries. Many small offsets are furnished to the orbit; and near the ront of the jaw bone it sends downwards an anterior dental •ranch, with a nerve, 8, of the same name, to supply the incisor nd canine teeth. The transverse facial artery, n^ commonly a branch of the ill' uperficial temporal, crosses the side of the face, supplying the ontiguous parts, and anastomoses with the facial and the infra- rbital arteries. UPPER MAXILLARY NERVE. The second trunk of the fifth cranial nerve (p. 117) is named ,s above from passing through the upper maxilla; it supplies the ^^^^^ eeth of the upper jaw. [luU. 1.

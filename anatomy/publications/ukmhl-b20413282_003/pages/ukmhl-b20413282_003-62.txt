172 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE NECK. two, nerve to the subclavius, f, and the supra-scapular, 9, are seer in a front-view of this region. i The vagus nerve, 10, passes through the neck and thorax to th( belly. At the lower part of the neck, on the right side, it occu pies the interval between the jugular vein and the carotid artery and crosses over the subclavian artery but beneath the innominati vein. It furnishes a small cardiac branch near the subclavian arteryi and close below that vessel it sends backwards the recurrent o: inferior laryngeal nerve. DESCEIPTION OF PLATE XIX. 1 ^ A VIEW of the deep muscles, and of the vessels and nerves a the back of the neck, is here given. After the integuments and the superficial muscles have beei reflected the complexus is to be divided near the head; and thi last muscle being thrown down and out, the vessels and nerve are to be sought in the dense tissue and fascia in which they ar imbedded. Lastly, the muscles are to be defined. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Extensor and rotator muscles of the head and neck lie beneat the complexus, B. Between the head and the first two vertebra and corresponding with the interspinales, are placed the rec muscles; and laterally there are two other small muscles, th obliqui. Occupying the vertebral groove is the semispinalis coll A. Sterno-mastoideus. B. Complexus cut through, C. Semispinalis colli. D. Obliquus inferior. F. Obliquus superior. G. Rectus posticus major. H. Rectus posticus minor. The complexus muscle, B, is attached by the outer edge to

DESCRIPim^ OF PLATE XXI. This Illustration of the deep dissection of the pterygoid regioi exhibits the third trunk of the fifth cranial nerve, and the dee^ branches of the internal maxillary artery. In preparing the dissection the internal maxillary artery shonl be cut through, and the condyle of the jaw having been disart^ culated should be drawn forwards with the external pterygoi muscle. After the removal of the fat the nerves and vessels wi be ready for learning. | MUSCLES OF MASTICATION^. ' The muscles described with Plate xx. are met with again in th Yiew, and they are marked with the same letters of reference, better idea of the wide origin of the external pterygoid is obtain- in this Plate. I A. Temporal muscle. B. External pterygoid muscle. C. Internal pterygoid muscle. D. Buccinator muscle. F. Masseter muscle. G. Digastric muscle. H. Zygoma thro^m down. L. Condyle of the jaw. N. Internal lateral ligament. 0. Styloid process, and maxillary ligament. INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. , The meningeal and the muscular branches of the inter maxillary artery, which were hidden in Plate xx., are now broui under notice ; and the other arteries, which are the same as in preceding Figure, are marked by the same letters. i a. External carotid trunk. I. Large meningeal artery. c. Small meningeal branch. d. Internal maxillary artery. e. Inferior dental branch. /. Branch with the gustatory nerve. Deep temporal brandies.

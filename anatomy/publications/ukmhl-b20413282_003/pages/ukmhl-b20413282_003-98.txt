208 DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. The elevators make ready the pharynx for receiving the aliment,; and they act in this way:â€”The large elevator draws upwards i and outwards the part of the pharynx above the os hyoides, | especially the part opposite the opening of the mouth ; and^ elevates the larynx at the same time. And the small or internal' elevator raises that part of the pharynx above the large elevator, | which would become loose by the action of the other muscle. Before deglutition takes place the hyoid bone is drawn] forwards and upwards by its elevator muscles, giving thus in-i creased size to the pharynx from before back ; and the larynx is I carried upwards and forwards at the same time under the tongue, j so as to allow the opening into the windpipe to be placed ini the position most favourable for its closure during the act ofi swallowing. i LARYNGEAL VESSELS. i j Two arteries on each side supply the larynx, and the pharynx! and windpipe in part. | a. Inferior thyroid artery. d. Larynf^eal branch of the upper ^ h. Laryngeal branch. thyroid. c. Thyroid branch. c. Lingual artery. /. Internal carotid. The upper laryngeal branch, d, is an offset of the superior thyroid artery, and enters the larynx through the thyro-hyoid membrane : its distribution in the larynx can be traced in Plate xxvii. The injerior thyroid artery, a, ramifies by the branch, c, on the under part of the thyroid body ; and sends a branch, h, into the interior of the larynx, which is delineated with the other laryngeal artery. NERVES OF THE LARYNX. Three of the nerves now apparent belong to the larynx and its muscles, and the remaining three enter the tongue.

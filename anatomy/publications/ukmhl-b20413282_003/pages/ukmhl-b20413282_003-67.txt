MUSCLES OF MASTICATIOX. MUSCLES OF MASTICATION. 177 The muscles employed in mastication are attached chiefly to I The kmporal muscle, A, arises from the temporal fossa on the jide of the skull, and from the upper part of the temporal fascia; [nd the fibres converge to a tendon which is attached to the under irface of the coronoid process, and to the groove along the fore art of the ramus of the jaw. Comparatively superficial ahove, the muscle passes below beneath he zygomatic arch and the masseter muscle, and rests on tlie ex- emal pterygoid, B. Near the zygoma a stratum of fat intervenes etween the fleshy fibres and the temporal fascia. In mastication this muscle cruslies the food by raising the Dwer jaw; and if the jaw has been moved forwards, the hinder ibres may be able to bring that bone backwards, with the aid of he muscles aitached to the chin. The masseter muscle, F, is placed externrd to the ramus of the aw. It takes origin from the lower border and the inner surface f the zygomatic arch ; and it is inserted into the outer surface )f the ramus of the jaw, from the tip of the coronoid process to he angle, and as far forwards as the second molar tooth. The ;uperficial fibres take a direction down and back across the deeper md straighter fibres. This muscle is the external elevator of the angle of the jaw. The internal pterygoid muscle, C, lias a position inside the amus of the jaw similar to that of the masseter outside. The lie angle and processes at the back of the lower jaw ; but one, 'hich occupies the cheek, blends with the lip-muscles. Temporal muscle. External pterygoid muscle. I.

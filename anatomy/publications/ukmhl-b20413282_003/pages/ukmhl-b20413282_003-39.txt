Process of the deep cervical fascia fixing the sterno-mas- toideus. t Lymphatic glands. The sterno-cUido-mastoid muscle, B, incases somewhat the nar- iwed part of the neck by the elongation of its edges forwards id backwards. The anterior curved border is manifest in the rawing, and it is kept in this position by a piece of fascia, N, [hich is attached to the low^er jaw. The muscle covers the carotid bloodvessels as high as the gastricus, and even when the head is thrown backwards. In the operation of tying the common carotid artery the muscle ould have to be dissected back for some distance before the line the vessel is reached ; and pressure on the artery must be ade through the muscle. This fleshy covering gives protection the large vessels; and these cannot be injured in wounds of e neck unless the muscle is cut. Dee;p cervical fascia. The special fascia of the neck invests the uscles with sheaths. Most of it has been removed in cleaninof as; ie muscles; but a strong process marked, N, has been left for e purpose of showing its connection on the one hand with the 3rno-mastoideus, and on the other with the angle of the lower w. The office of this piece is to keep curved the anterior rder of the sterno-mastoideus, for as soon as it is cut the edge kes a straifrht direction, as in Plate xvii. CONNECTIONS OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS, On each side there are three salivary glands in contact with the ver jaw. One is lodged behind the ramus and angle of the ne, and is named parotid: an(Uher is partly covered by the side the jawâ€”the submaxillary ; and the third, the sublingual, lies taeath the front of the tongue.

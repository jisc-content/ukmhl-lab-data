I' liERVES OF THE PTERYGOID REGION". 181 Besides branches received from the orbit and the face, it is joined pposite the angle of the mouth by a vein—the deep facial, or le anterior internal maxillary, which brings blood from the ptery- oid region and the upper jaw. Internal maxillary vein, lu. Only the ending of this in the ternal jugular remains,—the plexiform continuation of it by the ide of the artery having been taken away. NERVES OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. The nerves appearing in this dissection are branches of the nferior maxillary trunk of the fifth cranial nerve, with the ex- eption of two small nerves, one lying along the upper jaw, and iiother on the lower jaw. 1. Auriculo-leniporal nerve. 2. Inferior dental nerve. 3. Gustatory nerve, 4. Masseteric nerve, cut. 5. Buccal nerve. 6. Posterior dental nerve. 8. Buccal branches of the nerve. facial The anatomy of the inferior maxillary nerve is described with L^late xxi.; but the position of its several branches passing he external pterygoid can be here seen before the muscle is •aised. This large trunk of the fifth nerve is concealed as it leaves the skull by the external pterygoid; and its branches escape through the muscle or at its edges. Appearing at the upper border are the masseteric nerve, 4, and the deep temporal (Plate xxi., 8); and issuing at the lower border are three large trunks, viz., the auri- culo-temporal, 1, the dental, 2, and the gustatory, 3. TIiq buccal nerve, 5, comes forwards between the two pieces of the pterygoideus exteruus. The posterior dental nerve, 6, a branch of the upper maxillary trunk, descends along the upper jaw with its artery ; its origin and distribution may be referred to in Plate xxiii.

179 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. In playing a wind instrument this muscle is flattened, and the bres are contracted for the purpose of driving the outgoing air hrough the channel of the mouth ; but in the use of a blow- ipe the muscle is distended because the mouth is used as a reser- oir, but the fibres contract at the same time, to maintain a cou- inuous and active current of air. INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. The chief vessel in this dissection is the internal maxillary rtery, which is continued through the pterygoid region to the eep parts of the head, the nose, and the palate, supplying many tfsets. . External carotid artery. g. Deep temporal artery. Posterior auricular branch. h. Buccal artery. Superficial temporal artery. Internal maxillary artery. Inferior dental branch. I. Posterior dental branch. II. facial artery. r. Inferior labial branch. Branchwiththe gustatory nerve. ' s. Masseteric branch, cut. The internal maxillary artery, d, is one of the terminal branches |f the external carotid, and rans upwards and inwards over or l.nder the external pterygoid muscle to the spheno-maxillary fossa, Irhere it ends in branches for the nose, the palate, and the pharynx, t gives numerous branches, and these are classed into three sets : -one external to the pterygoid muscle, another whilst the artery ies on the muscle, and a third internal to the muscle, or in the pheno-maxillary fossa. The first two sets will be mainly referred 0 now. The first set of branches, two in number (dental and meningeal), )elong to the lower jaw and the skull. The inferior dental artery, e, enters the canal in the lower jaw nth the nerve of the same name, and supplies the teeth and the ower part of the face. Before it enters the bone, a small offset mylo-hyoid) descends with a fine nerve in a groove inside the amus of the jaw. The large or middle meningeal artery arises opposite the pre- X 2

I THE TRACHEA. 233 »obe, and crossing the common carotid artery joins the internal ugular trunk. I The trachea or windpipe, D, reaches from the larynx to the horax, and divides in that cavity into two pieces or bronchi—one 'or each lung. Placed in front of the oesophagus, Z, along the niddle line of the body, it is round and firm in ft'ont, but flat md soft behind, and is always pervious to the air. Its trans- verse width is about an inch in the male, but less in the female, [ts fore and hinder parts differ much in their composition. The firm fore part of the tube consists of dense fibrous nembrane, which incases separate pieces of cartilage about one dxth of an inch wide, and forming three fourths of a circle. Each piece has its convexity directed forwards; and the whole keep apart the walls of the tube. Behind, where the trachea is fattened, it is constructed by fibrous membrane (X, Fig. iii.) continuous with that containing the pieces of cartilage ; and beneath it is a layer of transverse muscular fibres, together with [some superficial bundles of short longitudinal fibres. ' Lining tlie trachea is a mucous membrane covered with a icolumnar and ciliated epithelium ; and beneath the same is a layer of elastic tissue which is collected into bundles in the flat part of the tube. Many glands are placed beneath the mucous membrane; and the largest occupy the back of the windpipe, where some are external to the fibrous and the muscular layer. DESCEIPTION OF PLATE XXVIIL These three Figures of vertical sections of the nose will indicate the boundaries of that cavity, and the openings into it. For Figure i., the right half of the nasal cavity was cut through vertically, and the septum nasi was removed,—the fore part of

The olfactory, or first cranial nerve, is marked by a bulb whi(;h rests on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and sends fila- ments to the nose through the subjacent apertures : it will be found attached to the brain. The optic, or second nerve, 2, ends in the eyeball. Posteriorly the nerves of opposite sides unite in a commissure (chiasma) on the olivary eminence of the sphenoid bone, with a partial decussa- tion of their fibres. In front the nerves diverge ; and each issues from the skull through the optic foramen, with the ophthalmic j artery. In the orbit of the left side the further course of the \ nerve to the eyeball is evident. j The motor oculi, or third nerve, 3, crosses the middle fossa, and ; enters its sheath of dura mater behind the anterior clinoid process, j as seen on the left side. Contained in the dura mater, it is conveyed ' to the sphenoidal fissure, and supplies all the muscles moving the ^ eyeball, except two. 1 The trochlear, or fourth nerve, 4, is received into a sheath of ' dura mater behind the posterior clinoid process, and courses for- ; wards through the wall of the cavernous sinus to end in one I muscle in the orbitâ€”superior oblique. The trifacial, or fifth nerve, 5, consists of two roots, large and ^ in the nomenclature arises from this difference in the mode of numbering, j The enumeration of the nerves as twelve appears most natural, as only two nerve trunks, with like function and distribution, will then be included in ' one cranial pair ; whilst, in using the smaller number, as many as four and \ six trunks, differing in name, function, and distribution, will be combined together as one pair of the cranial nerves.

The rectus capitis lateralis, H, resembles in position an inter transverse muscle ; it is attached below to the lateral part o the atlas, and above to the jugular eminence of the occipitii bone. ^ ^ -, 1, 1 The muscle will approximate the skull to the atlas, and so hel in inclining the head towards the shoulder. The rectus capitis a^iticus major, J, is continued upwards m line with the anterior scalenus. Arising below where the scaleni is attached, viz., from the transverse processes of the 6th, 5t] 4th, and 3rd cervical vertebrae, it ascends, becoming thicker nei the'skull, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipit bone. -nil. If the muscles of opposite sides act the head will be bow< forwards ; but only one acting it will turn the face to its oy side, in consequence of its oblique position. A third rectus muscle (rect. cap. anticus minor) lies betwe the two preceding, and passes from the atlas to the basilar pi cess of the occipital bone ; it is concealed by the vessels a- nerves near the head.

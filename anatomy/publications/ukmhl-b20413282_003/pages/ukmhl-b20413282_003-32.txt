142 DISSECTION OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. be depressed so as to make the point with the thread turn unde the vessel. Arterial branches. The smaller arteries laid bare in the dissec tion are derived from two arterial trunks. Behind the sternc mastoideus they are offsets of the subclavian or limb artery; am the branches in front of the muscle, or piercing it (except tb lowest), spring from the carotid or neck artery. ; The supra-scapular artery, h, comes from the first part of tW subclavian trunk, and runs behind the clavicle with its vein t the upper border of the scapula : it ends on the dorsum of tha bone. An offset from the supra-scapular to the integuments arise near the sterno-mastoid : in this instance it comes from the thin part of the subclavian, and is marked d. Transverse cervical artery, c. It arises in common with th( preceding, and crossing the side of the neck above the arch of th subclavian artery, courses beneath the trapezius : here it furnishe a large branch (superficial cervical), and bends finally along th base of the scapula with the name posterior scaimlar, and supplie the muscles inserted into the vertebral border of that bone. In the posterior triangle it gives many branches to the levato anguli scapulas, and to the lymphatic glands and the fat. Two small arteries, e and /, are offsets of the ascending cervici artery (a branch of the subclavian) : they are distributed to th muscles on the side of the neck, and to the areolar tissue and th glands of the triangular space. The posterior auricular artery^ g, issues in front of the sternc mastoideus, and ascends to the back of the ear and the contiguoii part of the head. A cutaneous offset, h, courses over the sterno-mastoid muscl( and accompanies the small occipital nerve. Perforating Iranches. After piercing the sterno-mastoid muscl these small arteries supply the platysma and the teguments. SUPERFICIAL VEINS OF THE NECK. In the neck there are two superficial or jugular veins, a latera

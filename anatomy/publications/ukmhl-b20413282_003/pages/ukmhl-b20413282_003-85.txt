DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. 195 t lullij; arked with 9, is called infra-orbital: it lies below the orbit, md supplies the muscles between the eje and mouth, and on he nose. In its course inwards its offsets cross, and join the ranches of the upper maxillary nerve, forming the infra-orbital '"'^^lexus by this arrangement. The facial is the motor nerve chiefly of the muscles of the ladiw'^gg and head; and it is distributed for the most part to nuscles receiving sensibility from the three trunks of the fifth *Branial ne e. To the buccinator, which acts as a muscle of mas- iication as well as a dilator of the aperture of the mouth, it gives ihe ability to contract; and consequently this muscle is paralysed vhen the other muscles which are supplied by the facial nerve pse their contractile power. in I mm h when toi ben Mecli DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXIY. ofl This Illustration will serve as a guide to the dissection of the internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries, and of the cranial nerves distributed in the neck. After the examination of the pterygoid region and the upper maxillary nerve, the dissection delineated will be prepared by detaching the styloid process with its muscles, and the external [mdl carotid artery and its branches; and by sawing off the large piece aperti of the side of the skull outside the jugular foramen and the carotid canal. Finally a dense fibrous tissue surrounding the j^onif|nerves and vessels near the base of the skull should be taken away carefully; and as the internal jugular vein renders obscure the view of many objects it may be removed. DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. Lying on the front of the spinal column are the deep muscles for the flexion and rotation of this part of the spine, and of the

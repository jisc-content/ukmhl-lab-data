down in front of it ia the phrenic nerve, 3. DESCEIPTION OF PLATE XYIIL The dissection of the subclavian bloodvessels with the coi tiguous nerves and muscles is pourtrayed in this Plate. This view has been obtained by cutting through the stern( mastoid muscle, after the dissection of the posterior trianguli space; and by sawing through the clavicle and removing tl inner end. On the section of the clavicle the shoulder falls bad and the subclavius and omo-hyoideus muscles are stretched. MUSCLES OF THE SUBCLAYIAN" EEGIOK Only the subclavius, the posterior belly of the omo-hyoideu and the anterior scalenus will be now referred to, the other muscL having been described in other dissections. A. Pectoralis major, cut. B. Intercostal muscles of the first space. C. Subclavius muscle. D. Omo-liyoideus-pusterior belly. E. Omo-hyoideus-anterior belly. G. Sterno-hyoideus. H. Sterno-tliyroideus. J. Sternal part of the sterno-m: toideus. K. Clavicular part of sterno-m; toideus, cut. L. Anterior scalenus. N. Middle scalenus. Anterior scalenus, L. The connections of the muscle may here studied : the attachments are given at p. 134, It 1 beneath the sterno-mastoid and omo-hyoid muscles; and it connected with the following vessels and nerves. In front of lies the subclavian vein, p, with the external jugular, s, a anterior jugular, v; and along the inner edge descends t large internal jugular vein, r. Beneath it is the subclav artery, h ; and on it are three small arteries, supra-scapular transverse cervical, h, and ascending cervical, /. Issuing fr beneath the muscle are the large cervical nerves; and runn:

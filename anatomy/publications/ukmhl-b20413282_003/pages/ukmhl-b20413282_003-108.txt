218 DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXVII. Figures ii. and iii. show the cartilages and ligaments of the larynx, with the Yocal apparatus ; and in Figure i. the muscles, vessels, and nerves are displayed. In the preparation made for Figure ii., the muscles were removed, and the right half of the thyroid cartilage was cut off, except the fore part and the lower cornu ; and then the muscles and the mucous membrane beneath the cartilage were taken away to lay bare the vocal cord, and the arytsenoid cartilage of the same side. Figure iii. exhibits the interior of the air passage in a larynx and windpipe slit down behind. HYOID BONE AND THE CARTILAGES OF THE LARYNX.

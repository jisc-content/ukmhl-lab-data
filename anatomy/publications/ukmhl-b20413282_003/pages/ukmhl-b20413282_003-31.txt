141 LIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN. link and branches would lie in the centre of an incision to reach he artery: this position of the vein may so interfere with the ccess to the artery as to render expedient division of the vein, nd ligature of the ends. Steps of the operation of ligature. Taking the most prominent art of the clavicle as the superficial guide to the position of the rtery, draw down the loose skin of the neck, and cut for two Qches and a half along the clavicle—the line of the vessel mark- Qg the centre of the cut—so as to divide on the bone the skin, he fat and the platysma, and the superficial nerves and vessels.* jct this cut be next moved rather above the clavicle ; and let the ■sk I'perator divide the deep fascia, and find his way vertically down- wards to the artery, looking out for tlie intermuscular interval petween the trapezius and sterno-mastoideus, and for that between he omo-hyoideus and clavicle, and incising any muscular fibres v^hich interfere with his progress. After the muscles have been lassed the surgeon proceeds cautiously, not letting the knife pass leneath the clavicle to wound the supra-scapular vessels or the sub- lavian vein, and using at this stage the outer, rather than the nner part of the wound. Towards the inner end of the incision he external jugular vein with branches will soon be met with ; ind it may be either drawn inwards, or divided and tied, accord- ng to the impediment it offers to reaching the artery. To find the artery in the bottom of the wound, look to the uter end for the firm and white cords of the brachial plexus, rhich serve as the deep guide ; and when these are recognised he artery will be found lower down, i.e. between them and the rst rib.t After the artery has been laid bare by the removal of ome fat and a slight sheath, the aneurism needle should be ^ jlitered in the outer angle of the wound, where the handle can If such a superficial vessel as that marked d, in the Drawing, should rise from the subclavian trunk, division of it at this stage would be followed y considerable haemorrhage, and ligature of it would probably be needed before 16 operation could be continued. t The projection or tubercle on the first rib, at the attachment of the nterior scalenus muscle, is said by some authors to serve as the deep guide D the vessel, but this eminence is seldom prominent enough to be felt by the nger.

THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY AND ITS BRANCHES. 1G7 Omo-hyoideus, B. The posterior belly of this muscle is attached hind to the upper border of the scapula, and ends in front in tendon beneath the sterno-mastoideus. It receives a small ssel from the supra-scapuhir, and a nerve from the descendens )ni; and the supra-scapular vessels, I and iv, and the supra- 1 apular nerve, 9, course backwards with it. See also Plate xv., id p. 133. Suhdavius muscle, C. In Plate ii. this may be viewed in its itural state, surrounded by a sheath of fascia. It arises from e first rib where the bone and cartilage join ; and it is inserted to the grooved under surface of the clavicle. The inner part of 'e muscle shows a ragged edge, where it was detached from the )ne. THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY AND ITS BRANCHES. The subclavian artery runs through the lower part of the neck, id gives branches to the chest, the shoulder, the neck, and the •ain. First part of the subclavian truuk. Third part of the subclavian. Common carotid artery. Inferior thyroid artery. /. Ascending cervical artery. Ii. Transverse cervical artery. I. Supra-scapular artery. n. Internal mammary artery. The subclavian artery of the right side begins opposite the mer end of the clavicle, where the innominate trunk bifurcates, id ends at the lower border of the first rib by becoming axillary, etween those points the artery forms an arch with the convexity pwards, which lies between the scaleni muscles. Its numerous mnections will be best learnt by dividing the trunk of the artery ito three parts:—one inside, one beneath, and one outside the nterior scalenus. The first part of the artery, a, is concealed by the muscles of the ont of the neck, viz., sterno-mastoideus, J, sterno-hyoideus, G, and ;erno-thyroideus, H ; also by the integuments and the platysma. t lies deeply, but not in contact with the spinal column. Lying near the chest and below the artery is the arch of the

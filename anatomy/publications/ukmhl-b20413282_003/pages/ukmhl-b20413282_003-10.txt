120 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. terminates in the bone, but some branches communicate with the arteries on the outer surface of the cranium. Branches are given by it to the dura mater. A petrosal branch enters the hiatus Fallopii with the small nerve, 17, to supply the temporal bone; and one or two offsets penetrate into the orbit, and join the ophthalmic artery. The posterior set includes two arteries: one is furnished by the occipital through the foramen jugulare, and the other, by the vertebral artery inside the skull. Of the two, the offset, m, from the occipital is the largest, and it extends even to the tentorium cerebelli. Veins. No vein accompanies either the internal carotid or the vertebral vessels which end in the brain; but companion veins run with the arteries distributed to the dura mater and the brain case. The veins with the large middle meningeal artery may be plainly seen in a dissection. CONTENTS OF THE ORBIT. In the orbit is lodged the eyeball with its muscles, vessels, and nerves. And the gland for the secretion of the tears is contained in the fore part of the same cavity. The dissection of this cavity requires some care in its execution, in consequence of the smallness of the vessels and nerves, and of the quantity of fat with which they are surrounded. On the right side the first stage of the dissection has been prepared by sawing through and throwing forwards the bony roof; and then slitting along the middle, and removing the peri- osteum of the cavity. On the left side, the cavity having been opened as before, the superficial layer has been taken away, to bring into view deeper vessels and nerves. SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES AND THE LACHRYMAL GLAND. The muscles contained in the orbit act on the eyeball, with the exception of one which raises the upper eyelid. Six muscles are attached to the eyeball; of these, four are straight, and direct the

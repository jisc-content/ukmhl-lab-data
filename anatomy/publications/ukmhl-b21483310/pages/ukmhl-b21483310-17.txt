15 the iiiclividual, tlie continuance of the species, and the main- tenance of our various relations with the world around us. And finally, after having investigated the structure of each organ and apparatus, we proceed to enquire what is its use, what are the functions it performs ? When treating of the functions, we in the first place state all the facts which have been clearly ascertained with regard to them—the observable phenomena as they occur, and in the order of their occur- rence; and then point out the inferences which legitimately follow from the facts set forth: and after taking a short retrospect of the opinions which have been entertained, from time to time, by those who have treated expressly of each subject, we conclude by dwelling on those which have the sanction of the best living authorities, and which, as such, may be considered the established doctrine of the present day. This is the section of our course which treats of Physiology. I may here observe, that as we usually select our • speci- mens from the adult subject, inasmuch as it presents the organs in their standard and perfect condition, our account of them would necessarily be incomplete, were we to confine it altogether to that single point of man's existence. For the body is never stationary, it undergoes a series of changes corresponding with the different ages of life; it commences in a parasitic state of existence in foetal life, from which it migrates, if I may so say, into infancy,— from infancy through puberty to adult age, and finally droops into decrepitude and senility. To you these changes are not merely a matter of curiosity, they form a necessary part of your study. Your views are not to be confined to any one period of man's life, or to any one state and condition of his organs. For in the discharge of your professional duties, you are required to examine and to treat the diseases of persons of all ages and of every condition, and to adapt your remedies to their various susceptibilities. Having thus examined the structure of all the parts of the body seriatum et singulatim, we in the next place review them in their state of aggregation,-wherein we find

16 them bound by various ties, associated by special sym- pathies, and united to form a being endowed with various powers and fitted for the highest destiny. Man in his individual capacity is thus presented to us,—not that we mean to study him as a subject of moral restraint, or of civil government, but merely as a zoological species, in which point of view he presents much to interest the phy- siologist as well as the naturalist. For when we look abroad and observe the infinite diversity of form and feature, of colour and stature, which he exhibits in different regions of the earth's surface, we naturally enquire whether there were originally formed several distinct races of men, or whether all are not descended from one stock—the diversities ob- served being merely varieties of a single species. The latter is the position we mean to affirm. When we have closed our remarks on this subject, we shall have concluded the physical and natural history of man. One part of the course yet remains; though an important one, a short notice of it shall suffice on the present occa- sion : it is that which is addressed to the practical ana- tomist. When treating it, we consider the body as divisible into several compartments or regions, each of which may become the subject of disease or of accident, requiring operations. We indicate the boundaries and extent of each region, point out the elevations and depressions which chequer its surface, and then examine the parts con- tained within its area, taking them as they are placed, one beneath the other, from the skin to the solid sub- stratum—the bone. These are the land-marks which guide the surgeon in the course he should take, which determine the direction, the length, and the depth of each incision he makes, and prescribe to him those limits within which he must confine himself, and beyond which he is on no account to go—those rigorous limits— " duos ultra, citraque nequit consistere rectum." Such is the outline of the course of Anatomy and Phy-

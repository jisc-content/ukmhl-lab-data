12 then, from the lowest point to the highest elevation in this extended series—to pass along link by link through the chain which connects it, is an effort not unlike that which we make when we ascend an eminence, in order to survey a prospect, where, every step of the ascent opens a wider view,—every new view gives an addition to knowledge, and the pleasure of pos- session more than repays the trouble of acquiring it. When we view the Animal Series as a whole, we observe arrange- ment and order pervading every part of it; when we inspect the individual links of the chain, we find each fitted for its sphere and suited to its lot; when we dip beneath the surface and scrutinise their composition, we trace, in every part of it, a wondrous adaptation of means to end—of structure to func- tion,—furnishing such incontestible evidence of design and contrivance, that the mind cannot but ascend at once to the contemplation of a designer, and soar from nature up to nature's God. It is not, however, because it is a part of Natural Science, or because it enters into systems of general education, that we here engage in the study of living structures and their functions. Nor do we require you to enter on so wide a field of investigation, as that of the whole Animal Kingdom. We direct our attention to one individual—to that one which is placed at the top of the scale, and we examine his composition in order to make a practical application of all the knowledge we can derive from that source, and from every other available source, in the alleviation and cure of disease. Such is the purpose for which we engage in the study of what is termed Human Anatomy,—a Science which has for its object a knowledge of the structure and functions of the human body; structure and function being studied as a necessary preparative—rather as an indispensable pre-re- quisite—to the right understanding of those derangements which constitute disease. When viewed in this light, we at once see that Anatomy bears the same close and intimate relation to every department of the healing art, M^hich che- mistry does to the arts generally, and which matliematics do

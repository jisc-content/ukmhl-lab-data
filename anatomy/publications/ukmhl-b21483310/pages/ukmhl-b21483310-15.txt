13 to tlie physical sciences. Hence its importance has been at all times fully recognized ; its utility may be traced in every page of the history of medicine. Were it not for the facts which anatomical research discloses to us, Physiology would be but a tissue of hypotheses and speculation; Surgery would be altogether without a guide; and Medicine must degenerate into a blind empyricism. Possessing so many relations, as this subject does, with other branches of science, and bear- ing such direct and immediate application to the healing art, which is so intimately connected with the well-being of the community, you will doubtless feel disposed to enquire what is the scope and plan of a systematic course of lectures on Anatomy and Physiology. In courses of instruction arranged on scientific principles, it is the practice to commence either by laying down a series of simple propositions, which, as being so many ultimate truths, form the basis of the science which is to be taught,â€” as is the case in mathematics : or as in chemistry, by stating the existence of a certain number of simple sub- stances, which, as being the elements or elementary consti- tuents of all those to be subsequently brought under consi- deration, form a foundation for the whole superstructure of the science. Just so it is in our course of Anatomy ; we know that the body is made up of solid and fluid constituents, and that the solids are divisible into a certain number of simple textures or tissues, which we consider elements; not ulti- mate elements, but what in technical phrase are termed organic elements. We therefore commence by exhibiting the properties and characters of these, and then proceed to the compound structures which are made up of two or more of them; adopting what may be considered a natural method, for we proceed from simple to compound, d notiorihus ad minus nota. The subjects treated of in this part of our course, have received much attention of late years. From the method pursued in its cultivation, that of analysis, it has been termed, by some. Analytical Anatomy; but as it treats of the general or pervading constituents of the body, and

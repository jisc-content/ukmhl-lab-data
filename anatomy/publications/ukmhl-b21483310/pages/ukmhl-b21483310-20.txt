18 were the previous circumstances from wliicli it arose, and which may be considered to have caused or produced it. Many diseases are but derangements of the functions of one or more organs, and they are those which are most easily controuled by the resources of art. Others consist of a change of structure, in the part or texture in which they are situated. Now to distinguish a cliange in the structure of a part, pre-supposes a knowledge of its natural and healthy condition; and to recognise a disturbance in its function, equally pre-supposes an acquaintance with its manifestations during health. For health and disease being opposing states, we can judge of them only by contrast and comparison. When prosecuting your physiological enquiries, v\dth a view to make them available to the diagnosis or discrimi- nation of diseases, it will not sufl&ce to study the action of each organ separately, you will have to proceed farther, and ascertain the connexions of each with the others, as well as the influence of those sympathies by which they are asso- ciated and linked together as parts of one whole. For as when examining the action of any machine with a view to repair it when out of order, we must ascertain not only the form, size, and arrangement of its parts, but also their mutual connexion and rate of movement; so in our living fabric, as its different parts like the spring, wheels, and levers of other pieces of mechanism, are associated and placed in a state of mutual dependence, we must clearly understand the mode and the nature of the dependence, before we can devise a rational and consistent plan to rectify those errors of action which from time to time occur. This is the sort of knowledge which is most available for practical purposes. It is the knowledge of this mutual dependence of organs in health, which enables the physician to estimate their reciprocal influence in disease, and to determine which amongst a group or train of morbid phenomena presented to him is primary, â€”which, secondary and accidental. For it enables him, by tracing back the chain of causes and effects, to ascertain what was the original point of departure

0 Again, tlie constituents of the body are constantly under- going a succession of changes; new matter being received from without to supply loss,—to repair defect, at the same time that old and elFete particles are as constantly cast olF by various outlets. Changes such as these, and the play of affi- nities by which they are effected, obviously come within the domain of Chemistry. The examination of the composition of the solid and fluid constituents of the body, and of the secretions elaborated by the different organs, comes under the same head; and when, in investigating the function of respiration, we enquire into the alteration produced in the respired air by its stay in the lungs, we can only determine its nature and extent by the known principles of Eudiometry. These are the steps by which your medi- cal studies insensibly lead you on, and urge you to an acquaintance with other sciences. It requires little more than a passing glance at the subject, to perceive the effect and tendency of such pursuits: they cannot fail to strengthen the mind by the habits of investigation they require,—to enlarge it by the comprehensive views they unfold, and so render Medicine, in the truest sense, a liberal art. The branches of science whose connexion with Anatomy I have just now indicated, may be viewed in the light of accessories. There are others which bear so close and inti- mate a relation to it, that they must be considered of primary importance. None bears so close a relation to Human Anatomy, as that which treats of the structure of animals. For as Man is placed at the top of the scale of being, he necessarily participates in some particulars, of the characters and conformation of those creatures which are placed below him, at the same time that he exhibits others which are peculiar to himself; hence arise many points of analogy and relation between his internal structure and that of animals. This, surely, is a sufficient inducement to us to engage in the study of Comparative Anatomy,—a science which has for its object a knowledge of the structure of the different classes and orders of animals, and which is so called, because

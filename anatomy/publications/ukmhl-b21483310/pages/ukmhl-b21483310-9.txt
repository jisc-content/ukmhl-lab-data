7 parts is perceived—their reciprocal influence recognised— tlie dependence of all on a common moving power is ascer- tained—and the subservience of each to a common end is demonstrated. Just so it is, that after we have examined the different parts and organs of the body, we find the details into which we had been drawn so numerous—I had almost said multifarious—that the mind retains a disagree- able impression, as if of complexity and difficulty. But when we take it in another point of view; when we observe the limbs in action, and note the infinite variety of movements they can execute, tracing, at the same time, their perfect adaptation to their various purposes,—when we examine the powers of those curious instruments, the organs of sense by which we maintain our relations with the world around us,—when we scrutinize the functions of those inward parts which are more immediately connected with the life and well-being of the individual,—and when, at every step of our progress, we recognize each of these parts as instru- ments designed for special purposes, and in them trace the workings of causes in the production of efi'ects, the adjust- ment of means conducive to ends—then, every idea of com- plexity is removed, and any impression of difficulty that may be incidental to the nature of the subject, gives way to that gratified feeling which arises from the discovery of truth—the acquisition of useful knowledge. When viewed in this light, we see how difficult it is to separate, even in thought, the consideration of structure from that of function, or, in other words, to dissever Ana- tomy from Physiology. The mind will not, perhaps can- not, rest merely on the consideration of an agent, or what can become such, in a state of continued quiescence, any more than it can reason on the uses of a machine in con- ■ stant inaction. Hence it is that we take structure and function together, we join physiology to anatomy, and treat them as one department of study. I may here observe, that this is not a detached or isolated subject; it is, on the contrary, variously connected with 9

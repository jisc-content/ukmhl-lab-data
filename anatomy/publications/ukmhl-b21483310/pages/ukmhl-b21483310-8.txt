6 private as well as in public—it enlarges the sphere of my usefulness, and affords more ample means of promoting a taste for (fain would I add, diffusing a knowledge of) that science for which I have always felt an ardent interest, and to which I have devoted my life. It has been often said, that the "proper study of mankind is Man:" it is a study in which several classes of persons engage, each with special views,— with distinct objects. Some study the laws by which Man is bound in society, with a view to expound them to others, or to amend and improve them:—some study his mental powers—his moral character, to correct his errors, or ame- liorate his condition; whilst others investigate his physical composition, in order that they may be able to correct those errors of action, or, in other words, those diseases which, from time to time, occur, and so mitigate some of the " ills which flesh is heir to." This is our object; it is with this view that we enter on those studies which here engage om* attention. Man—or rather his corporeal frame—is observed alter- nately in a state of action or of rest, exhibiting at one time all the varied movements which it manifests during life, at another, that total privation of action and of power wliich supervenes at death. It is in the latter condition only that the body becomes the subject of anatomical investigation; and were we to confine ourselves solely to that state, our researches .would enable us to proceed no farther than to ascertain that it was made up of many parts, each exhibiting a certain form and size, consistence and texture. It would be, in fact, as if we took up a watch after its movement had ceased, and proceeded to examine it. That it is a very complex structure, we should see at a glance—that each of its parts was of a particular form, and that all were placed in a certain position with regard to one another; and there our enquiry should terminate. But if it were put in motion, a new stimulus is at once given to enquiry; a new field is opened for it, and an additional interest is felt in pursuing it. The connexion between its different

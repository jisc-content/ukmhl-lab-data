14 exhibits enlarged views of tlieir properties and characters, it is usually named General Anatomy. Now as a knowledge of the structure and functions of the different parts of the body is a necessary preliminary to the investigation of those de- rangements which constitute disease, we can at once per- ceive what an intimate relation subsists between General Anatomy and Pathology; it is, in fact, the proper introduc- tion to the study of disease, which is the main object of your pursuits. When attending the lectures on pathology, a new field of enquiry will open to you; your previous anatomical studies having made you acquainted with all that is known, relative to the healthy and natural condition of parts, you will be prepared to follow with effect the discourses of the Professor of Pathology, in which he will treat of those alter- ations of structure which are induced by disease. And when once acquainted with the physical changes, you cannot fail to proceed a step farther, and enquire what are the constitu- tional disturbances which accompanied these changes during life,—^what are the signs which characterized them ? and so you group round each morbid alteration its appropriate symptoms, and make them stand to one another in the relation of sign and thing signified. In this way you pro- ceed, step by step ; one part of your studies leading to ano- ther by an easy and natural transition, whilst all are so directed as to converge towards the chief object of your pur- suits—the knowledge of diseased structures and deranged actions. After having concluded the preliminary section of the course which treats of general anatomy, we pass to that which has for its object the special description of the differ- ent parts of the human body. In this we follow the plan adopted by systematic writers ; we describe successively each in its proper order, the osseous system, the muscular, vascular, and nervous, first dwelling on the component parts of each, then dilating into general remarks on the aggre- gates which they make up. In the next place, we examine those groups of organs which are subservient to the life of

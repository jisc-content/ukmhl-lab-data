22 friends, will be fully realized. In the new relations which are about to be formed between us here, you, I am sure, will perform your part by steady application to study,—we shall assuredly fulfil ours by zealous co-operation and constant superintendence. The heads of our University have already executed their part of the compact: their theatres and labo- ratories,—museums and libraries, are all open to us, so that we are abundantly supplied with all the facilities necessary for the furtherance of the ends we respectively propose to ourselves—you in the acquisition, and we in the diffusion of useful knowledge. Nor is this all; by collecting together within these walls, all the elements and means of instruction in every department of science, they secure to the votaries of each the advantages to be derived from the influence of all—for to widen the sphere of observation, is to enlarge and enlighten the mind. Hence, there necessarily must arise in this place what exists in every great academical institution— there must be produced within it, and about it, what may not unaptly be termed a floating atmosphere of learning, wliich necessarily imparts some degree of influence to all,—even to those whose professional avocations require them to direct their chief attention to some one department of study. En- tering on your pursuits, then, with such views as these to impel,—such feelings to animate,—your time cannot but be profitably spent: and when at some future period, perhaps when engaged in the active duties of a useful and honour- able profession, you look back on the time of your sojourn here, I confidently anticipate that it will always be with a feeling of satisfaction arising from the consciousness of having sedulously devoted it to liberal pursuits—to the acquisition of useful knowledge.

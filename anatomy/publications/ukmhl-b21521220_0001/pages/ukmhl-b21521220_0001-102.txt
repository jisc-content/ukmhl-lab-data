100 THE EYE, Part VI. § io. ‘Ihe Nerves cf the Eye and of its Appendages. Besides the optic nerve already defcribed, the globe of the eye receives feveral fmall ones, which run on each fide along and about the optic nerve, from its entry into the or- bit to its infertion in the globe. Thefe filaments come^chief- ly from a fmall lenticular ganglion, formed by very fhort ra- mi of the orbitary or ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair, and by a branch of the third pair, or motores oculi. The nerves of the lenticular ganglion having reached the globe of the eye, are divided into five or fix fafciculi, which having furrounded the optic nerve, and penetrated and per- forated the fclerotica, run at diftances more or lefs equal be- tween the fclerotica and choroides towards the iris. There each of them is divided into feveral fhort filaments, which terminate in the fubftance of the iris. Thefe fmall nerves, which run from behind forward, between the fclerotica and the choroides, have formerly been taken for particular ligaments by anatomifts of confiderable eminence, but are now known under the name of ciliary nerves. The nerves which go to the other parts belonging to the eye, come from the third, fourth, fixth, and firft two branches of the fifth pair of nerves, and likevvife from the portio dura of the feventh pair. The third, fourth, and fixth pairs give nerves to the mufcles of the globe of the eye. I he two branches of the fifth pair, and the portio dura of the feventh, give nerves not only to the other parts which furround the globe, but alfo to the mufeuli frontales and internal parts of the nofe. The trunk of the third pair, or motores oculi, having enter- ed the orbit through the iuperior orbitary fiflure, or foramen lacerum of the fphenoid bone, produces four branches. The firft runs upwards, and divides into two; one for the rnufeu- lus levator oculi, and the other for the levator palpebrae iu- pericris. The trunk continuing its courfe, gives off the fe- cond

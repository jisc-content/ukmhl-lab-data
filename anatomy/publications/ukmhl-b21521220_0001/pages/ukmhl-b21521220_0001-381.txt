Chap. Iir. OMENTUM. 379 of the fame portions of fat, which ate confiderably finer than in the other. We lee from this fituation of the two om nta, that in the fpace left between the lower fide of the llomach, at d upper fide of the melocolon, they have a very bread communica- tion with each other; 10 that if either of them contained in its cavity any fluid, that fluid might rcadiiy get between the ftomach and melocolon, and (o pals into the other big ; Spe- cially when the llomach is empty, and consequently its dtua- tion ealilv changed. Therefore, by means of this interjlice between the flotnach and melocolon, the two omenta form one cavity, winch opens into the cavity of the abdomen by one common orifice, fituated near the comnnfl'ure on the right fide of the great omentum. This orifice is lemilunar or femicircular, and formed by the union cf the two membranous ligaments, whereof one com eels the beginning of the duodenum and neck'of the veficula fellis to the liver ; the other conneds the contiguous portion of the colon to the lame vilcus, anti extends to the pancreas, hrom thence arifes, an incurvatcd border, which luirounds the root of the lobulus, leaving an' opening wide enough to admit the end of the linger. To tiilcover this orifice of the omentum, we need onlv raife a little the great lobe of the liver, and find out the rout of the lobulus, and apply it to a large pipe wrapped round with cotton, wool, or tow, to hinder'the re^rds of the air. Then if we blow gradually, the air wiil influe toe tides of the great omentum, ami give it the appearance of a large blad- der irregularly divided-into lewral irbts or tubercles bv the bands of fat, which appear in this fiate like fo many fraena between the lobes. â€™ To be lure of lucceeding in this experiment, the two e- rr.enta mull be in their natural flare, and they mufl be hand- led very gently with the fingers firfi: dipped in oil. it fuc- cecds

SECRETION of the BILE. Part VI. 3$2 £ 17. Secretion of the Blip. 1 1 The /iW, being the largefl' pf all the vifcera, fills tip a very large part of the abdomen in its upper chamber, above the melocolon ; and is (till larger, in proportion, m the foe- tus. It is furrounded on all fides by the neighbouring vifce- ra, and fixed by ligaments in ipch a manner as to be fufpend- ed in the body, with a confiderable degree of firmnds ; yet io as to be allowed a confiderable liberty to move and be va- . • * rioufly agitated, railed, and deprcffed, by the actions of the diaphragm. This large vifcus is fupplied with veffels of various kinds. For, betides the arteries, it has the vena portarmn, which receives all the blood of the ftomach, inteltines, mefentery, fpleen, omentum, and pancreas, by two trunks ■, viz. the tranlverfe fplenic and afcendmg meffnteric; and afterwards by one which is continued with the mefenteries. This is large, compofed of ftrong membranes, and iurroumied with much denfe (hort cellular (ubltauce, derived to it from the , mefentery and fpleen, and adding (trength to its membranes, which are Itrongcr than thofe of the aorta. Many of th.e fmaller veffels and hepatic nerves, which all come together under the denomination of a capfula, are intermixed with this cellular fubfiance. By this the vena portarum is conducted to the liver, and firmly fuftained ; infomuch that the branch- es, being cut, do not collapfe but preferve their round ap- pearance. Each branch of this veffel is divided into many others, again divided and fubdivided, like the arteries, till they at length produce the fmalleff capillaries. In this courle every branch of the vena portarum is accompanied with a concomitant branch of the hepatic artery, creeping upon the furface of the tfein, and upon the contiguous hepatic dutfls, almoft in the fame manner as the bronchial arteries ufually ereep

SECRETION or the SEMEN Part VE 442 the ereftions which take place in animals totally different from man, and especially rhofe-which take place in birds very quickly ; and by the inactivity of the ereftor mufcles them- felves in the libidinous ertdtion of the penis, and from their unfitnefs for compreffing the veins. It is alio probable, that an erection may be produced by the numerous ramifications of the nerves exciting a convulftve conltriction of the veins j while, at the lame time, the arteries, by an increafed velocity of the blood, bring more blood to the parts than the veins can carry off The caufe of this convulfion is perhaps inhe- rent in thefe nervous Sphincters themSelves, and depends ei- ther on a mechanical irritation of the nervous fibres, or cn the force of the imagination. A long continued and violent erection is at' laft accompa- nied with an expulfion of the Semen ; and this requires much greater force than is requifite for the erection only. For the Semen is expelled when the irritation of the nerves is arri- ved at its greatelt height : and in natural venery, when, at length, the cellular fpaces of the urethra and its continuous glans, which are at lalt filled, become lo far diltended with a large quantity of warm blood, that the nervous papillae. Stretched out in the latter, become violently affefted from the irritating or pleafing cauSe. The Seminal veficles are emptied by the levator mufcles of the anus, which prels them againft the refitting bladder with a convulfive motion, excited either by a voluptuous imagination, or by thcexquifite lenfibility of the nerves of the glans, principally in its lower part, which is in the neighbourhood of the frenum. Hence the Semen is never discharged with any of the urine, in an healthy man ; becaufe the expulfion of it requires the bladder to be clofed or drawn up firmly together ; for, while lax, it affords little or no refiftance to the Seminal veficles. The tranfverfe mufcles Seem to dilate the canal of the urethra for the recep- tion of the Semen expreffed from the veficles. Soon

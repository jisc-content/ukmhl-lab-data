Part Vfc KIDNEYS and URETERS. 40O the orifices of the fmall collateral branches and gullets of the infundibula. A little above thefe holes, there are other two very much like them, and fo on all the way to the extremity of the fuperio'r blanch, which terminates likewife by thefe gullets of the infundibula; and in each of thefe gullets we may obferve at leaft the apex of one papilla A fe&ion begun on the convex furface of the kidney, and carried from thence to the trunk of the ureter, difcovers the extent of the papillae very plainly, and likewife the infundi- bula, their gullets, &c.; but it will be difficult to give begin- ners a juft idea of the ftrudture of thefe parts without the other fetftion. The ureters run down obliquely, and with a very fmall degree of inflection, from the kidneys to the lateral parts of the inner or anterior lide of the os lacrum ; and paffing be- tween the rectum and the bladder, they terminate in the laft of thefe vilcera, in the manner that fhall be explained here- after. - ...1 ' They are compofed of three proper coats; the firft of which, that furrounds the reft, is of a whitifh colour, and of a very compadb filamentary texture, being ftretched with dif- ficulty, and appearing like a filamentary fubftance degenerat- ed. The next coat is of a reddilh colour, ftronger than the firft, and is compoled of mufcular fibres, although this has been doubted by fome authors. The innermoft coat is in fome meafure ligamentary, and lined by a very fine membrane, which covers a very delicate reticular texture of veflels, and is moiftened all over by a mu- cilaginous liquor. Befides thefe proper coats, the ureters are inverted by the cellular fubftance of the peritonaeum, the membranous la- mina of which covers likewife about two thirds of their cir- cumference, fometimes more, fometimes lefs, but never fur- rounds them entirely ; So that when they are examined in their

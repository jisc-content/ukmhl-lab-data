390 Chap. III. KIDNEYS and URETERS. the branches of the ureter ^of which the uppermoft is the longeft, and the lowed is the fihorteft, becaul'e of their oblique direc- tion downward. From this defcription, we fee, that in the human kidney there is no other common or uniform pelvis, tut the trunk or head of the ureter, and the three great branches. To have a true idea of their difpofition, we muft imagine that the ureter enters the kidney by the lower part of the oblong iinus ; that it increafes gradually in breadth as it advances 5 and that it is divided into three branches before it enters the fubftance of the kidney. One of thefe branches may be reckoned a direcl conti- nuation of the ureter, and it is longer than the reft, being extended from the lower to the upper part of the finus; and it may be found without much preparation. The other two branches are fhorter, and cannot be well dil'covered without an artificial reparation. The angles between thefe branches at their bales, or at the head of the ureter, are not pointed as thofe of other ramifications, but formed by a round incur- vation, which is generally furrounded by fat. Thefe firft branches of the ureters produce other fmall branches at the bottom of the finus, which are difpofed in pairs. Thele (mall collateral branches extend in breadth, and form the infundibula or calices, in which the papillae are lodged i the great circumference of which produces, in the fubftance of the kidney, the different vaginae of the vafctilar arches and ,of their ramifications. The internal la- mina of the kidney is continued round thefe vaginae j and the external lamina is expanded round the firft branches, â€¢round the trunk, and round all the reft cf the ureter. If the trunk of the ureter be fplit on that fide which is next the vertebrae, and this fedlion be continued to the ex- tremity of the.fuperior branch, we may oblerve, immediately above the trunk, two holes lying near each other, which are

PENIS. Part VI. 434 ofla pubis, and partly enters the corpora cavernofa, and part- ly runs along their upper fide, fending off fmail lateral branch- es, which iurround thefe bodies, like irregular half arches, and penetrate them by numerous ramifications. 1 he crural arteries lend each likewife a branch, which, running behind the contiguous crural vein, is ciifiributed to the integuments of the penis, by the name of pudica externa, and communicates, by lateral ramifications^ with rhofe of the pudica interna. Thcle communications are not only between the internal and external pudicae of the fame fide, but alfo between thole of both fides, which reciprocally communicate wnk each other. v i Tne diftribution of the veins follows nearly that of the ar- teries j but they have more ramifications and communica- tions, as in other places. The principal vein is that which runs along the whole luperior groove formed by the union of the corpora cavernola. It palics diredly under the fympliyfis of the ofla pubis, between die two arteries. It is very large, often double, and very d'eldom triple, but the trunks do not feparate while in the groove j ar.d it has a great number of valves. This great middle vein opens into the branches of both hypogafinc veins. The lymphatic velTels of the per.is appear to go 'chiefly into the plexus in the groin, on the two inner fides of the pelvis, about the middle of tire arch of the ofla pubis. At this place we oblerve a venal plexus, which co- vers the upper convex fide of the firlt portion of the urethra, before it .is lurrounded by the fpongy lubflance. The fpermatic veflels, of which we have already deferibed the origin and courle all the way to where they go out of the abdom'en, having reached on each iide near the tefiicle, are divided into two principal fafciculi, one of which is larger than the other. The largefi is the anterior, and is diftribu- ted through the teftide, by a prodigious number of very fine capillary

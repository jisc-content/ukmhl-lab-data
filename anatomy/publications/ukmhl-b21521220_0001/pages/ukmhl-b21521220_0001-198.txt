196 THE MOUTH, &c. Part VI. which is collefled in all parts of the fauces, greatly conduces. Therefore, in general, between the nervous and innermoft. coat of the pharynx, a great number of Ample mucous folli- cles or cells are placed, pouring out their mucus through fhort mouths; of a foft, and fomewhat watery nature; but ropy and vifcid, abounding with oil and volatile falts, and more earth than the faliva itfclf. The aliments are moved through the oefophagus as through an inteftine. The longitudinal fibres, afcending to the carti- lages of the larynx, dilate the gullet, oppofite to the defen- ding morfel. But, when it is received, the longitudinal fibres equally dilate and elevate the gullet at that place which re- ceives it. Then that part of the oefophagus where the mor- fel is feated, being irritated, contracts, and moves the food downward. This mufcle is ftrong, and very irritable. The upper opening of the ftomach is contra&ed or com- preficd in fuch a manner, by the lower mufcle of the dia- â€ž phragm, in every infpiration, as to confine the food within the ftomach, and direft it in every exfpiration, by preflure, naturally towards the pylorus. By this means, the ftomach is fo clofely fhut, that, in the moft healthy man, even wind or vapours are confined within it j nor do they ever afcend but by a morbid affe&ion. CHAP.

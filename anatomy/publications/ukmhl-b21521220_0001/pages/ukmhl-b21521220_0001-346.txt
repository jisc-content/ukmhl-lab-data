fM4 DIGESTION. Part VI. * remains of that power which it had of digefting other « things.’ “ When bodies are opened fome time after death, a confi- derable aperture is frequently found at the greateft extremity of the ftomach. 1 In thefe cafes,’ lays Mr Hunter, ‘ the ‘ contents of the ftomach are generally found loofe' in the * cavity of the abdomen, about the fpleen and diaphragm. * In many fubjeCts, this digeftive power extends much farther * than through the ftomach. I have often found, that, af- * ter it had diflolved the ftomach at the ufual place, the ‘ contents of the ftomach had come into contact with the ‘ fpleen and diaphragm, had partly diflolved the adjacent < fide of the fpleen, and had diflolved the ftomach quite * through; fo that the contents of the ftomach were found ‘ in the cavity of the thorax, and had even affected the * lungs in a fmall degree.” The flefhy fibres of the ftomach being irritated by the fla- tus, the weight, and the acrimony of the food, begin to con- tract themfelves more powerfully than when the ftomach is' empty, and with a greater force in proportion as it is more full. And, firft, the mufcular ftratum, which pafles along the lefler curvature, draws the pylorus to the oefophagus; and, being inferted only into the left face of the former, draws it to the right. The principal ftratum of the circular fibres contracts the capacity of the ftomach according to its length; grinds or intermixes its contents with the liquors; and determines them both, like the preflure of two hands placed oppofite, to flow towards the pylorus : But this flux through the pylorus is not continual, on account of the val- vula pylori, and likewife becaufe this motion begins from fome part that is more irritated, and, as we fee by nume- rous experiments, part of it is very foon received into the blood. Thefe alternate contractions at laft terminate in a full evacuation. In this aCtion of the ftomach, there is no- i thing

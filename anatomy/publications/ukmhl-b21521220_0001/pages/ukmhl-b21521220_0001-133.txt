Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 13* part of the convexity of the concha, fo that it is oppofite to the anterior ligament. There is likewife a kind of fuperior ligament, which leems to be only a continuation of the apo- neurofis of the frontal and occipital mufcles. Of the mufcles of the external ear, fome go between the cartilages and the os temporis, others are confined to the car- tilages alone. Both kinds vary in different fubjedls, and are fometimes fo very thin as to look more like ligaments than : mufcles. The mufcles of the firft kind are generally three, , one fuperior, one pollerior, and one anterior; and they are ; all very thin. The fmall mufcles tvhich are confined to the cartilages, i are only fmall ftrata of fibres found on both fides of the car- ttilages. In many fubjeds they are of fo pale a colour as not tto look at all like mulcular fibres. Of this number are thofe 1 which Wallalva difcovered in the different cavities on the backfide of the cartilage ; and thofe found by Santorini on tthe tragtis, and along the convex part of the anterior portion cof the helix. (See the 1'reatife on the Mufcles.) The lkin of the external ear is in general a continuation cof that which covers the neighbouring parts of the tempo- rral region. The lkin on the forefide of the ear is accompa- nied by a very fmall quantity of cellular fubftance ; and there- fore we find all the eminences and cavities of that fide difi. tinttly marked upon it, as far as the bottom of the external meatus auditorius. In what has been faid of the lkin, the epidermis is likewife comprehended. The backfide is covered by the lkin continued from the I forefide but, as the folds are there very dofe, it only paffes over them, except that portion of the concha which fur- rounds the entry of the meatus auditorius, and which is join- ed to the os temporis by means of the cellular fubftance. The hollow of that common fold which lies between the antihelix and

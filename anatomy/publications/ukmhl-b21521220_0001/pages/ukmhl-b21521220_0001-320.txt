Part VL INTESTINA CRASSA. I of the fame length with the caecum, but very flender. It is teimed appendicula â€¢uertniformis, from its i up poled refemblance - to an earth-worm. Its cornu on diameter is not above a quarter of an inch. By one extremity it opens laterally and a little obliquely into the bottom of the caecum ; and the other extremity is ciofed, being iometimes greater, lometimes fmaller, than the reft of the appendix It has fome contortions, like thole of a worm when it is touched, from whence comes the epi:hct oi vermuularts or wrmjormis. Its ltructure refemnles nearly thac of the other inteltines. ^ The internal coat of this appendix is foiliculous, like that of the duodenum ; and it is iikcwife reticular, the mellies being the glandular lacunae, which continually difeharge a fluid into its cavity. It has often been diluted whether this appendix, or the large portion, which is, as it were, the head of the colon, ought to be called the caecum; but the general divifion of the inteftines into great and fmall, leaves no room to doubt of its being only an appendix in man, whatever reafon there may be for talking differently with refpedf to brutes and birds. Through the membranous or common coat of the caecum, we fee three white mufcular ligamentous looking bands, which adhere very clofely both to the outer and mufcular coat. One of them is hid by ihe adhelion of the mefocolon ; and all the three divide the caecum longitudinally into three parts more or lefs equal. They all unite on the appendicula vermiformis, and cover its whole outer fide immediately under the common coat. Though they appear exteriorly on the caecum to be ligamen- tary, they are made up anteriorly of flefhy fibres which ac- company and ftrengthen the longitudinal fibres of the mui- fular coat. The

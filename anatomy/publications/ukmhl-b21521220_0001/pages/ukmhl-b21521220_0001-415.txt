SCROTUM. 413 Chap. IV. The \ without it. From this fituation, they might properly enough be divided into external and internal parts; and all thofe be- longing to the firfl clals might be defcribed before thofe of the fecond. But, as it is Bill more proper to have a regard to the oeco- noiny of thefe parts, according to which their functions be- gin in fome internal parts, are continued in fome external parts, return again to the internal, and are finifhed in the external; we fliall follow the fame order in delcribing them. The firfl of thele four clafles comprehends the fpermatic veins and arteries ; the fecond, the teftes, epidydimis, and fcrotum ; the third, the vaia deferentia, veliculae feminales, and probates ; and the fourth, the corpora cavernofa, ure- thra, integuments. See. Scrotum. The fcrotum is the cutaneous covering of the telles. Outwardly, it is a bag common to both, formed by a continuation cf the fkin of the neighbouring parts, and com- monly very uneven, having a great number of rugae on its outer furface. Interiorly, it is flcfhy, and forms a mufcular capfula for each teBicle, termed dartos The exterior or cutaneous portion of the fcrotum is nearly of the fame Bructure with the fkin in general, of which it is a continuation j only it is iomething finer ; and it is likewife plentifully Bored with febaceous glands and'Fiedbs of roots of hairs. Though it is a common covering for both teBicles, it is neverthclefs diBingudhed into two lateral parts by a fuperfi- cial and uneven prominent line, which appears-like a kind of future, and from thence has been termed raphe. This line is a continuation of that which divides, in the fame manner, the cutaneous covering of the penis ; and it is continued through the perinaeum, which it divides likewife all the way to the anus. It is only fuperficial, and does not appear on the inlide of the fkin.

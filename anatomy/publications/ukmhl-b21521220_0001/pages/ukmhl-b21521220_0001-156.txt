THE EAR, 4 Part VI. num, to be clianged or renewed ; and it alfo ferves to convey the mucus that covers the little bones and the tympanum : Nor is it at all improbable that the air enters by this tube, to fupport the tympanum when it is preflcd inward by the more violent founds ; for founds themfelves, received into the mouth, are this way conveyed to the organ of hearing. In infpiration, the air prelfes the membrane of the tympanum outward ; and from thence proceeds that clafhing or whif- pering noife, by which the hearing is obfeured, in yawning ; for then the air entering more abundantly through the cavity of the tube, to the tympanum, relifts the tremors of the ex- ternal air. With refpedt to. the nerve which is diftributed through the veftibulum and femicircular canals, there is no doubt but it is ftruck by the tremors of the external air, propagated to the rtapes ; from whence the tremors immediately pafs through the feneftra ovaiis, to prefs upon the naked pulp of the nerve ; and it is probable that the fpiral plate of the cochlea, fpread full of nerves, is agitated with tremors from the ofcillations of the membrane of the tympanum, by which the air in the cavity of the tympanum is agitated, fo as to prefs the membrane of the feneftra rotunda, which again agitates the air contained in the cochlea. The preceding conje&ure is plauftole ; fince the fpiral plate9 form a triangle, with a very acute vertex, on whole furfaee it is polhble that a number of tranfverle nervous cords may be flretched ; and thefc cords, bei"g of different lengths, will be in unifon with a variety of toneÂ«, fo as to tremble ifochronally with them ; namely, the fongeft cords in the balls of the cochlea with grave founds; and the fhorteft cords nearer the tip or apex, with lharper founds. Whether are founds perceived in the middle femicircular canals, fince thele alone are found in all clalE s of animal- ? Are they de- tuned in thefo canals, in the cochlea, and by the membrane lulpcnded

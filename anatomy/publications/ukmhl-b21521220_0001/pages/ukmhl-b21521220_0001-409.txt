VESICA URINARIA. 407 Chap. IV. low and filled with blood, even in adults, as high as the middle of the bladder, through all which fpace they likewife fend off ramifications. Afterwards they lole their cavity, and become ligamentary as they afcend. At the upper part of the bladder they approach each other; and joining the urachus, form that'rope, which may be termed the fuperior li- gament of the bladder The external fibres of the fnufcular coat are more nume- rous than the internal; and the moll longitudinal anterior fibres form a kind of incurvation round the uracht s at the * top of the bladder, much like that of one of the flelhy por- tions which furround the iuper.'jr orifice of the Itoniach, and lower extremity of the oefophagus. This incurvation paffes behind the urachus. V The portion of the peritonaeum which covers the pofterior ' convex fide of the bladder, f rms a very pro inent tranfi. verfie fold, when the bladder is contncied, which difappears when the bladder is extended. This fold furrounds the pos- terior half of the bladder, and its two extremities are elonga- ted towards each fide ; by which elongations, a kind of 1 te- ral ligaments of the Â«,ody of the bladder are formed, which are more confiderabie in children than in adults. Befides thefe, the bladder has two other ligaments, which are fixed at their fore part to the upper and inner fide of the nffi pu- bis, near the iymphyfis of tilde two bones; from whence they run buck, becoming gradually broader, to be fixed to the fidcs of the bladder. .Sabatier calls them the inferior an- terior ligaments of the bladder. The lower part of the bladder, which deferves the name of fundus much better than the upper part, is perrorated by three openings, one anterior, and two poltenor The ante- rior opening is formed by an elongation of all the proper coats, in form of a guiler, turned much in the fame manner with the inner orifice of the roilrum of the head of an alem- bic.

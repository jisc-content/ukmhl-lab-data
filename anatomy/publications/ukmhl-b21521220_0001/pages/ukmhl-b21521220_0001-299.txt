Chap. III. *91 PERITONEUM. The great blood veffels, that is, the aorta and vena cava, are likewife. involved in this cellular fubftance of the perito- naeum. In a word, it involves immediately and feparately, all the parts and organs which are commonly laid to lie in the duplicature of the peritonaeum. The true lamina, or membranous portion of the perito- naeum, is conne&ed by the intervention of the cellular fub- ftance to the inner furface, of the cavity of the abdomen ; but it does not naturally accompany the external elongations of that fubftance. it only covers the origin or balls of thefe productions, without any alteration in its own lurface at thefe places. It has, neverthelefs, productions of its own ; but they are very different from thofe of the cellular fubftance ; .for they run from without inward, that is, they advance from the convex fide of the great bag of the peritonaeum into the ca- vity of that bag, fome more, fome lefi, and alio in different manners, as if the fides of a large ball or bladder were thruft inward into the cavity of the ball or bladder. Of thefe internal elongations of the peritonaeum, fome are limply folded like a duplicature ; others are expanded like inverted bags, or lacculi, to contain fome vifeus ; others begin by a fimple duplicature, and are afterwards expanded into a cavity which contains fome organ ; others are alternately ex- tended in the form of fimple duplicatures and of cavities; and, laftly, others form only a finall eminence on the inner furface of the great cavity of the peritonaeum. Under the firft fpecies of thele productions, we may bring the membranous ligaments of the abdomen, fuch as thofe of the liver, colon, &c. We fee the fecond fptcies in the external membrane of the liver; the third in the mefentry ; the fourth in the mefocolon; and the fifth at the kidneys and ureters. Vol. II. P p Befides

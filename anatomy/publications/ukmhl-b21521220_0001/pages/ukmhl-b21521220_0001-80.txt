THE EYE, ,8 Tart VI. The humours are three; the aqueous, vitreous, and crys- talline. 1 he firft may properly enough be called an humour, and is contained in a Space formed in the interftices of the anterior portion of the coats. The fecond or vitreous hu- mour is contained in a particular membranous capfula, and fills above three-fourths of the (hell or cavity of the globe of the eye. It has been named vitreous, from its fuppoled re- femblance to melted grafs; but it is really more like the white of a new-laid egg. The cryftaUine humour-is fo called from its refemblance to cryftal, and is often named {imply the cryfatline. It is ra- ther, a gummy mafs than an humour, of a lenticular form, more convex on the back than on the forefide, and contained in a fine membrane called membrana or capfula cryjlallina. What has been here faid is fufficient to give a general idea of the three humours of the globe of the eye. \ ' ■. ‘ * # * § 3. The Coats of the Eye in particular. The mofl: external, the thickcft, and ftrongeft' coat of the eye, is the Sclerotica or cornea, and it inverts all the other parts of which the globe is compofed. It is divided into two portions, one called cornea opaca, or fclerotica, the other cornea lucida, which is only a Small legment of the Sphere Situated anteriorly. The fclerotica is of a white colour, and confifts of many fibres clofely conne&ed ; and is of a firm texture, refembling. parchment. About the middle of its pofterior convex por- tion, where it fuftains the optic nerve, it is perforated, and thicker than any where elfe ; its thicknefs diminishing gra- dually toward the oppofite fide ; and its fubftance is pene- trated obliquely in Several places by Small blood-vefiels and nerves. The courfe of the nervous filaments through this coat is very Angular 5 they enter the convex fide at Some diftance

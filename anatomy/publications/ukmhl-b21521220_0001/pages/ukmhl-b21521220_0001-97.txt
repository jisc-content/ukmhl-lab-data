Chap. I. 95 AND ITS APPENDAGES. The borders of each palpebra, taken together, are formed by the edge of the tarfus, and by the union of the internal membrane with the Ikin and epidermis. This border is flat, and of fome fenfible breadth, from within about a quarter of an inch of the internal angle, all the way to the external angle, near which the breadth diminifhes. This breadth is owing only to the thicknefs of the palpebrae, which at this place have their edges oblique or flanting, in fuch a manner as when the two palpebrae touch each other flightly, a trian- gular fpace or canal is formed between them and the globe of the eye. Cilia. The flat edge of each palpebra is adorned with a row of hairs called cilia, or the eye-lopes. Thofe belonging to the fuperior palpebra are bent upward, and are longer than thofe of the lower palpebra which are bent downward. Thefe rows are placed next the fkin, and are not Angle, but irregularly double or triple. The hairs arc longer near the middle of the palpebrae than toward the extremities ; and, for about a quarter of an inch from the inner angle, they arc quite wanting. Glandalae ciliares. Along the fame border of the palpe- brae, near the internal membrane, or toward the eye, we fee a row of Anall holes, which may be named foramina or punBa ciliaria. They are the orifices of the fame number of fmali oblong glands which lie in the fulci, channels, or grooves, on the inner furface of the tarfus. Thefe little glands arc O of a whitilh colour; and, when examined through a fingle microfcope, they appear like bunches of grapes, thofe of each bunch communicating together ; and, when they are fqueezed between two nails, a febaceous matter, like foft wax, is dif- charged through the puntfla ciliaria. They are more nume- rous in the upper than in the under eye-lids, and were firft, painted by Caflerius, but afterwards defcribed by Meibomi'us, by whofe name they are frequently called. Pane?a

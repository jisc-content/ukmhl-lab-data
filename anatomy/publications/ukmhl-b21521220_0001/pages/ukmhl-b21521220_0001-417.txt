TESTES. 4Â»5 Chap. IV. The rl he aponeurotic or ligamentary expanGon of the dartos is fixed in the ramus of the os pubis, between the mufculus tri- ceps and the origin of the corpus cavernofum of the fame ' fide, which lliall be detcribed hereafter, all the-way to the lower part of the fymphyfis of thefe bones. The internal pomon of thele u.ufcular bags, or that which forms the fep- tum Icroti, is fixed to the urethra by means of a communi- cation between the lame ligament^ry expunlion, and another, which (hall be explained in its proper place. Coats of the tijles. The particular coverings of the teftes are commonly called coats and they are reckoned to be three in number, the tunica mulculola, named cremnjlcr, vagi- nalis, ai d albuginea. The firll two are common to each tefticle, and to the fpermatic rope that belongs to it ; and the third is peculiar to rhe tefiicle alone. The tunica vaginalis is the moll confiderable of the three, and mull be deferibed firll, in order to conceive the ftrudlure and conne xion of the cremalter, which is very improperly called a coat. The albuginea lliall be deferibed with- the tefles. The tunica vaginalis is a continuation of the vagina of the fpermatic rope, which, as it approaches the tefticle, is gra- dually dilated, and forms two capfulae, one contained with- in the other, the external being the longeft and broadeft at bottom ; fo that there is a void fpace there left between them, in which the tefticle is lodged. This ftru&ure may likewife be explained in the following manner : The vagina having reached as low as the tefticle, is divided into two laminae, the innermoft of which is the bottom of the vagina, and the outermoft is expanded round the tefticle, and gives it a coat, called vaginalis, from the Latin word vagina. The antients termed it likewife clytroides from a Greek word that fignifies the fame thing.

â€¢ 138 . the ear, Part VI. the fuperior portion of the edge of the tympanum near the centre of which is the extremity of the handle; and the pro- cell 11s gracilis forward, reaching all the way to the articular fiiTure in the os temporis. It is eafy, after what has been faid, to diftinguilh the malleus of the right fide from that of the left. Stapes. The ftapes is a fmall bone, very well denominated from the refemblance it bears to a ftirrup. It is divided into the head, legs, and balls. The head is placed upon a fhort flatted neck ; the top of which is alfo fometimes fiat, fome- times a little hollow. The two legs, taken together, form an arch like that of a fiirrup ; in the concave fide of which is a groove that runs through their w'hole length. One leg is longer, more bent, and a little broader than the other. The balls refembles that of a fiirrup, both in its oval lhape and union with the legs, but it is not perforated. Round its circumference next the legs is a little border, which makes that fide of the balls ap- pear a little hollow. The other fide is pretty fmooth ; and one half of the circumference is more curved than the other. The fubjeft being in an ere& pofture, the fiapes is to be corfidered as lying on its fide, wnth the head turned outward near the extremity of the leg of the incus ; the balls, inward, being fixed in the feneftra ovalis ; the longed leg backward, the fhorted forward; and both in the fame plane. By this fituation, it is eafy to know the fiapes belonging to each ear.- Os orbiculare. The os orbiculare, or lenticular bone, is the fmalleft bone in the body. It lies between the head of the. fiapes and extremity of the long leg of the incus, being arti- culated with each of thefe. In dry bones, it is found very clofely connected, fometimes to the ftapes, fometimes to the incus; and might, in that r { fiate,

INTESTINUM COLON. Part VI- 322 The membranous coat of the extremity of the ileum is continued on the caecum and colon, without finking into any fold at the place where the ileum enters the colon. The longitudinal fibres of the mufcular coat feem here to be con- founded with the neareft circular fibres of the caecum and colon. The inner portion of the mufcular coat of the ileum runs in between the circular fibres of the ileum and colon, as into a common fold of thefe two inteftines ; from all which a thick fliort portion of a flefhy tube is formed, which is the circular rifing already mentioned. The tunica nerrofa and villofa of the extremity of the ileum likewife enter the common cavity of the caecum and colon, and on the edge of the circular rifing join the like c'oats of thefe two inteffines ; fo that the circular rifing or fliort mufcular tube is covered, both on the outer and inner .fides by a nervous and villous coat ; that on the fide being fupplied by the ileum, and the other by the two great intef- tines. The fituation of this extremity of the ileum is mod com- monly tranfverfe, and is inferted almoft in the fame direction in the common cavity of the two inteffines already mention- ed ; but it is often a little more inclined toward the caecum than to the colon;.and whereas, in all other places, the ileum is wide, and eafily dilatable, it is very narrow,at its infertion, and its fides are more folid and firm. It is chiefly in this ftrufture that the mechanifm of the in- fertion of the ileum in the caecum and colon confills; about which infertion or opening authors are very much divided, fome reckoning it a valve, others only a fphincler'. It is very evident, from what we have faid, that it is a double machine, contrived to hinder the return of the ex- crements into the ileum, becaufe it can produce this effect partly as a valve, and partly as a kind of fphinfter.

Their anterior extremities feem to be loll at the lower part of the corpora ftriata •, and, it is for that realon that they are efteemed the pedunculi of the cerebrum. The tranlverfe annular, or rather femi-annular protube- rance, is a medullary production, which feems at firft fight to furround the pofterior extremities of the great branches ; but the mtdullary fubftance of the protuberance is in reality intimately mixed with that of the two former. Varolius, an ancient Italian author, viewing thefe parts in an inverted fi- xation, compared the two branches to two rivers, and the protuberance to a bridge over them both ; and from thence it has the name of pons Varolii. Its furface"'is tranfverfely flreaked, and is divided into two lateral parts by a very nar- row longirudinal deprefiion, which does not penetrate into its fubftance. When we cut into the fubftance of the pons, we find much cortical fubftance within it, and this formed into ftriae, which run in various directions. And the fame thing will be found with refpcCt to the medullary part of the brain •, for there is icarcely any part of it but what has cor« tical ftriae running through it.—See Monro’s Obfervations on the Nervous Syftem, Tab. VII. The fmall branches cf the medulla oblongata are lateral productions of the tranfverfe protuberance, which by their roots feem to encompafs that medullary portion in which the fourth ventricle or calamus fcriptorius is formed. They form in the lobes of the cerebellum, on each fide, thofe medul- lary expanfions, a vertical feCtion cf which fhews the white ramifications commonly called atbor vitae i and they may be juftly enough ftyled pedunculi eerebtlli. The extremity is no more than the medulla oblongata con- tracted in its paffi’.ge backward to the anterior edge of the foramen magnum of the os occipitis, vvhere it terminates in the medulla ipirialis j and, in this part of it, leveral things arc to

HEAR T. Part VI. 210 the auricular orifice, the other the arterial orifice. The right ventricle opens into the right auricle, and into the trunk of the pulmonary artery 5 the left into the left auricle, and into the great trunk cf the aorta. At the edges of thefe orifices are found feveral moveable pelliculae, called valves by anato- iriifts ; of which feme arc turned inward toward the cavity of the ventricles, called triglochines, or tricufpidcs; others are turned toward the great vefiels, called femilunares', or figmoi- ilales. The valvulae tricufpides of the left ventricle are like- i wife termed mitrales. Viniriculi. The inner furface of the ventricles is very un- even, many eminences and cavities being obfervable in it. The mod confiderable eminences are thick flefhy productions, called columnae. To the extremities of thefe pillars are faf- tened leveral tendinous cords, the other ends of which are joined to the valvulae tricufpides. There are likewife other fmall Ihort tendinous ropes along both edges of the feptum between the ventricles. Thefe fmall cords lie in an oblique tranfverfe fituation, and form a kind of net work at different diftances. The cavities of the inner furface of the ventricles are fmall deep foflulae or lacunae placed very near each other, with fmall prominent interfaces between them. The greateft part of thefe lacunae are orifices of the venal ducts, to be deferr- ed hereafter. Structure of the ventricles. The flefhy or mufcular fibres, of which the heart is made up, arc difpoled in a very lingu- lar manner, efpecially thofe of the right or anterior ventricle > being either bent into arches or folded into angles. The fibres which are folded into angles are longer than thofe which are only bent into arches. The middle of thefe arches, and the angles of the folds, are turned toward the apex of the heart, and the extremities of the fibres toward the balls.' Thefe fibres differ not only in length, but in their directions.

1*2 THE MOUTH, Part VI. From modulation of it by the organs of the mouth at the fame time. All fpeech is reducible to the pronunciation of letters, which differ in various nations ; but their general properties are alike all the world over. Of thefe, fome are called vowels, which are made by an exprefilon of the voice, with- out any application of the tongue to certain parts of the mouth. But confonants are formed by a collifion of the tongue againft certain parts of the mouth, lips, and teeth. But, to be more particular in thefe matters is beyond our purpofe, which does not permit us to expatiate upon the beautiful art of pronunciation. That art, as an extraordi- nary inftance of mechanical knowledge, has fo accurately de- termined all the corporeal caufes concurring to each letter, that, by infpe£tion only, with the affiftance of touch, letters pronounced are underftood without hearing them ; and the attentive perfon is thereby taught to imitate the fame fpeech by a like ufe of the organs. / - § 5. The Pharynx. The pharynx is a mufcular and glandular bag; the outer furface of which is clofely joined to the inner furface of all that fpace which is at the bottom of the mouth, behind the pofterior narcs, uvula, and larynx, and which reaches from the cuneiform procefs of the os occipitis all the way to the oefophagus, which is a continuation of the pharynx. This fpace is bounded pofteriorly by the mufcles which cover the bodies of the firft vertebrae of the neck, and laterally by the fuperior portions of both the internal jugular veins and of both the internal and carotid arteries, by the fpinal apophyfes of the os fphenoides, by the extremities of the apophyfes pe- trofae, by the os fphenoides immediately above the internal alae of the apophyfes pterygoides, and by the neighbouring portion of both pterygoid mufcles.

T t The roots; and having formed a fmail trm.k, they are again di- vided, and enter fotne neighbouring gland by the fame kind of ramifications by which they went out from the former. La Flea l vejjels. Thefe are termed lymphatic vejjels, becaufe for the mod part they contain a very clear, limpid, though mucilaginous ferum, called lympha by anatomifts. But as they have lileewife ,been obferved to be filled with a white milky fluid, called chyle, they have been called vafa chylijerat or venae laclcne. They have the name of veins, becaule their valves are dilpofed as thofe of the ordinary blood-veins, and becaufe the fluid which they contain runs from fmaller into larger tubes: But the particular deferipnon of thefe will come in more properly in a latter part of the work. / ยง 12. The Blood-vejjels and Nerves of the Int fines. Blood-vejfels of the Intcfmes. The duodenum has common- ly a particular artery, called duodenalis or intejlinalis, which comes indifferently from the ftomachica coronaria, pylorica, galtrica major, or hepatica. It has likewTe leveral diltituft ramifications from ,thefe trunks, ^nd from the mefenterica fuperior and fplenica; which ramifications communicate with each other. The arteria duodenalis, and the other addit onal fmail ar- teries, form a vafcular network round the mufcular coat of the inteffine, which fends out a great number of capillaries toward both the outer and inner fides, that make the whole mteftine look of a red colour. The veins of the duodenum are ramae of the vena por- tae, and the diftribution and denomination thereof is much the fame with that of the arteries; only they communicate more with each other than the arteries, and alfo with the great Haemorrhoidal vein.

Chap. r. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 8i Vol. II. L The At the anterior edge of the choroides we find the iris com- pofed of two laminae ; the poflerior of which, being of the colour of a grape, was called uvea by the antients. In the middle of the iris there is a hole termed pupil: This, in a foetus, is covered with a membrane called pupillaris, which generally difappears about the feventh month ; or between the feventh and ninth month, according to Wrifberg. Be- tween the two laminae of the iris, we find two very thin planes of fibres, which have been fiippofed to be muicular; but this matter is not yet fujly afcertained. The fibres of one plane are orbicular, and lie round the circumference of the pupil; and thofe of the other are radiated, one extre- mity of which is fixed to the orbicular plane, the other to the great edge of the iris. The iris has motions of fuch a nature, that the pupil is contrafled at the approach of a ffrong light, and is dilated/upon being expofed to a weak one. The different colours which appear in the iris, feem to be owing to an intermixture of veflels and nerves. That the iris poflefles red veflels is evident from injection, and from obfervations on the eye during life. [See Monro on the Struc- ture and Phyfiology of Fiflies). The plicae or procefius ciliares are fmall radiated and pro- minent duplicatures of the anterjor edge of the choroid coat; and their circumference anfwers partly to that of the ciliary circle. They are oblong thin plates ; their external extre- mities, or thofe next the choroides, being very fine and poin- ted ; the internal are broad, prominent, bifurcated, and alter- nately long and fhort, making flight depreflions on the fore part of the vitreous humour. In the duplicature of each ciliary fold we find a fine reticular texture of veflels; and fome anatomifls pretend to have feen flefliy fibres in the fame plate, lying in fmall grooves of the membrana vitrea, as we fhall fee hereafter. 1 â–

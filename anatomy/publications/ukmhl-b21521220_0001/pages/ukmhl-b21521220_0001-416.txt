4*4 Part Vl, SCROTUM. i The The inner furface of this cutaneous bag is lined by a very thin cellular membrane, through which the bulbs and glands appear very diftin&ly when we view its infide. The rugae of the fcrotum are in the natural hate commonly a mark of health, and then its fize is not very large, it increafes in fize, chiefly according to its length ; and then the rugae dis- appear more or lefs, according to the degrees of the preter- natural ftate or indifpofition. The dartos of the fcrotum has been accounted a true cuta-r neous mufcle; but it is chiefly a cellular fubflance condenfed, with a great number of blood-veflels entering into its compo- sition, but without fat. This fubflance is thin, and by the difpofition of its fibres, forms a bag with two cavities, or two frnall bags joined laterally to each other, and contained with- in the cutaneous portion. The lateral parts of thefe two bags, which are turned from each other, are longer than thole which are joined together ; and by this union a feptum is formed between the teftes* which may be called mediajlinum fcroti. The raphe or future already mentioned, adheres to the edce of this feptum, and thereby braces down the middle of the cutaneous portion, which from thence appears to have in part two cavities *, a#id this was perhaps what gave occafion to make the French word for the fcrotum to be in the plu- ral number. The other edge of the feptum adheres to the urethra. The dartosTias a ftri£l connexion with the reft of the cel- lular fubflance, efpecially at the upper part below the groin, where its anterior and external lateral portions terminate by a kind of tendinous or ligamentary expanfion, which is ftron°ly united to the internal cellular membrane. We have often fhewn this as a particular fafcia lata, which gives in- fertion to the portions of the dartos juft mentioned, and as a broad fraenum which keeps the fame portions together.

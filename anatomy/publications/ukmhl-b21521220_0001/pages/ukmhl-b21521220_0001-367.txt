26S VESSELS of the LIVER.' Chap. III. and of the duffus hepaticus ; for this laft duff runs for fome fpace within the fides of the former, before it opens into the cavity, much in the fame manner as the duftus cholidcchus pafles into the duodenum. W inflow has obferved, at the open- ing of the hepatic into the cyitic duft, a fmall loofe valvular membrane, which may hinder the bile from returning out of the uuidus cholidochus into the liepattcus. But later anato- mies ddcriDc only a (harp angle at the meeting of the cyflic and hepatic ducts, fimilar to the bifurcation-of the arteries or veins. â€¢ The bile, which pafTes through the duftus hepaticus into the choiidochus, may be called hepatic s and that which is collected in the veflcula fellis, may be termed cyflic. 1 he he- patic bile flows continually through the duftui cholidochus into the duodenum ; whereas the cyftic bile flows only by reafon of plenitude, or by comprefiion. Remarks cn the vej/ils, EsV. oj the liver. The trunk of the vena portae ventralis terminates between the lobulus and the oppofite part of the great lobe ; and there joins the trunk of the vena portae hepatica in the tranfverfe finus of the liver, between the right extremity and the middle of that finus. The umbilical ligament, and confequently the umbilical vein in the foetus, joins the trunk of the vena portae hepa- tica toward the left extremity of the tranfverfe finus of the liver. The canalis venofus in man is not exadlly oppofite the vena umbilicalis, but a little to the right fide ; and there- fore thefe three veflels lie in fuch a direction as to form two oppofite angles, refembling thole of the handle of a wheel or of a fpit. In the foetus, therefore, the blood which comes from the umbilical vein does not run direflly through that contained in the vena porta hepatica in the finus, and from thence into the canalis venofus; but is obliged to turn from left to right, and fo to mix with the blood in the vena portae, before it enters

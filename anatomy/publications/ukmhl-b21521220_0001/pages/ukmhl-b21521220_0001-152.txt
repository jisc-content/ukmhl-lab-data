Pvt VI, S5Â» TKE EAR, where having joined the nervm lingualis of the fifth pair, it is conlidered as a kinu of rtcirreut; bur the remaining part of its courfe mull be referred to the deicripuon of the tongue. The portio dura of the auditory nerve having pafTed through the foramen ftylo-maitOid-um, is diltribured in the manner to be afterwards mentioned in the dci'cription of the nerves; and we ought very carefully to obferve its different communications with the branches and rami of the nerves of the fifth pair, with the fympatheticus medius or eighth pair, with the fecond pair of cervical nerves, and with the nervi fub-occipitales, or tenth pair of the medulla oblongata, &c. Hearing. As the fenfe of hearing perceives the elaftie tremors or impulfions of the air, fo we oblerve the fenfitive organ of the ear to be compoled in a different manner from that of any of the other fenfes. It confiits, for the moft part, either of hard bones, or elaftie cartilages and mem- branes, which are the moft exquifitely enabled to receive and communicate the neceffary tremors. As we have already delcribed the feveral parts of this com- plicated organ, we (hall proceed to its phyfiology. The fonorous waves of the air flow into the external car, which, from principles of mechanics, it mult of courfe colledk together, Elaftie air receives, and is the principal means of transferring fonorous tremors; for found is increaftd in con- denfed air, and is loft in vacuo. Other bodies, however, have the property of conveying found ; and Dr Monro has fhewn, in his Phyfiology of Fillies, that water conveys found nearly as quickly as the atmofphere. The transferring me- dium receives thefe tremors, either from lome body ftriking againft it, or from the medium itfelf colliding agninft ano- ther body, or iaftly, from the collifion of two bodies againft: each other. Every particle of the body which produces {dundj ought to tremble or vibrate in fuch a manner as alter- nately

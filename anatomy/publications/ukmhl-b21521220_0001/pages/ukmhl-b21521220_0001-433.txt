The / Chap. IV. PENIS. 431 cd by Iviery in 1684. They feem to be wanting in fome fub- jefts; for certain anatomifts ef accuracy have fearched for them without finding them. A third gland of this kind is defcribed by Cowper as being feated a little more anteriorly; but this alio, Heifter obferves, is wanting in bodies difiefled by our bcft anatomifts. Orifice of the urethra. The cavity of the urethra refembles nearly that of a fmall writing pen. It is not every where round, and towards the glans becomes broader and flatter on each fide, efpecialiy in the glar.s itfelf, where there is a kind of oval or navicular foflula. This canal terminates at the extremity of the glans by a narrow oblong orifice or fiflure, \vhich is much lefs than the reft of the cavity. The commiffures of this fmall fiflure are turned, one toward the convex, the other toward the flat fide of the glans; and the labia of the fiflure are its lateral parts; and it leems to be furrounded by flefliy fibres.' !The common integuments. The integuments which cover all thefe parts are three or four in number. The firft is the lkiÂ« with the cuticula ; the fecond is the' common cellular mem- brane, which in this place leldom contains any fat; the third is termed nervous; and the fourth is a particular cellular membrane, which is not always to be found. Praeputium. The firft of thefe integuments, the fldn, is a continuation of that of the pubes and fcrotum ; and it ad- heres to the fecond all the way to the balis of the glans, where that fecond integument ends. The reft of the cutane- ous integument covers the glans without adhefion, and ter- minates by an opening. This portion is named praeputium; and along'the whole lower or back fide of the whole integu- ment in general, and of the praeputium in particular, there runs a fine future, which is a continuation of the raphe of the perinaeum and fcrotum.

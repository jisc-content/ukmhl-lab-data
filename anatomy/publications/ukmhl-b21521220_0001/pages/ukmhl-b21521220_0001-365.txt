Chap. III. VESICULA FELL1S. 363 That fide of the body of the veficula which lies next the t 1 liver, is connected to that vifcus by a vaft number of fila- ments, which run a great way into the fubltance of the liver. Among thefe fibres, in fomeanimals, dudts have been obfcrv- ed a long time ago, They are moft numerous near the neck of the veficula, and they are named dtiElus cyjio-hepaticiy or hepatico-cyJUci; but no fuch ducts can be demonftrated in the human body. The neck of the veficula is formed by the contraction of the fmall extremity; and this neck, bending afterwards in a particular manner, produces a narrow canal, named clufiui (yjiicus. This incurvation reprefents, in fome meafure, the head of a bird, of which the cyftic duct, by the gradual di- minution of its diameter, exprefles the beak. This cannot be feen when the liver is extra fitum; and even infitit it is but very imperfectly feen, when, in order to view the con- cave fide, the liver is raifed and thruft too much againit the diaphragm ,; for by thus inverting the liver, the curvature is difordered, and we fee two in the place of one. To fee this curvature in its true natural fituation, the liver is to be raifed but very little,^and the duodenum' left un- touched ; then we mud (loop and look under the liver with- out difordering anjf thing. This incurvation may be of ufe to hinder too precipitate a difeharge of the bile contained in the veficula, which fome fituations of the body might occa- fion. The neck of tâ€™:e veficula is nearly of the fame ftruChtre with the other parts. It has on the infide feveral reticular rugae and fome folds, which appear like fragments of vatvu- lae connivcntes, fituated very near each other, from the neck to the contraction of the cyflic duct. The firlt of thefe folds is broad and large, and almoft circular; the next is more oblique and fmaller in fize, and the reft diminifh in the fame manner. Taken all together, they form a kind of fpi- raL

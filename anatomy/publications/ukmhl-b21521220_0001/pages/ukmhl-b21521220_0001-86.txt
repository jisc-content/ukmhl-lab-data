THE EYE, Part Vl. S4 fiftence for iome time in the capfula, and then runs off by little and little, till it quite difappears. The tunica vitrea is defcribed by Winflow as being com- pofed of two laminae very clofely united, which quite fur- round the mafs of humour ; but later authors, as Sabatier, &c. find only one, which, after covering the vitreous hu- mour, runs to the edge of the lens, and whether It goes far- ther is uncertain. The anterior part of this membrane, which extends between the vitreous humour and edge of the lens, is covered with black ftreaks from the'pigmentuin ni- grum, and by different authors has been called membranula coronae ciliaris ; by Zinn, -zonula ci/iaris. When a putufture is made through this, and air is blown in, it forms a paffage which runs round the lens ; and has been termed Canalis Pe- titianus, after the difcoverer Petit, who defcribes it in the Me- moirs of the Royal Academy, 1728. The internal furface of the tunica vitrea gives off', through the whole fubflance of this humour, a great number of cel. lular elongations or fepta difcovered by Riolin, fo extreme- ly fine, as to be invifible in the natural ftate, the whole mafs appearing then to be uniform, and equally tranfparent, through its whole fubflance ; but they are difcovered by put- ting the whole humour, foon after it is taken out of the bo- dy, into fome acefcent and gently coagulating liquor. Thefe cells muff communicate with each other ; for, by puncturing the membrane, and hanging up the eye for a lhort time, a confiderable part of the humour runs out, fo that the eye becomes lighter. The radiated fulci of the tunica vitrea, which may be termed fhlci ciliares, are perfectly black when the coat is ta- ken out of the body. This proceeds from the black fub- ilance with which the laminae or procefi'us ciliares, as well as all the refl of the choroides, are naturally covered, and which remains in the bottom of the fulci after the laminae have been

Part VI. 162, THE MOUTH, ยง 3. The Tongue. The tongue is a foft flefhy body, which fills all that part of . the cavity of the mouth that is furrounded by the alveolary border and teeth of the lower jaw, and extends ftill farther back. All this lpace is therefore in a manner the mouid and meafure of the length and breadth of the tongue, as well as of its thicknefs and figure. Tile tongue is divided into the bafis and point ; the up- per and under tides ; and the lateral portions or edges. The bafis is the pofterior and thickeft part; the point, the ante- rior and thirmeft part. Ihe upper fide is not quite flat, but a little convex, and divided into two lateral halves, by a fhal- % low deprefled line, called linea linguae mediana. The edges are thinner than the other parts, and a little rounded, as well as the point. The lower fide reaches only from the middle of the tongue to the point. The tongue is principally compofed of very foft fleftiy fibres, intermixed with a particular medullary fiubflance, and difpofed in various manners. Many of thefe fibres are con- fined to the tongue without going any farther; the reft form feparate muf'cles, which go out from it in different ways, and are inl'erted in other parts. All the upper tide of the tongue is covered by a thick membrane of a papillary texture, upon which lies another very fine membrane like a kind of epi- dermis, which is likewife continued over the lower fide, but without papillae. Under the epidermis, on the lurface of the tongue, we find the corpus mu.cofium thicker but more moift than in other parts of the body. This difpofition feems neceflary to protect the tender papillae, which are the organs of tafte. In brute animals, a perforated mucous net-work receive the papillae, which are in a manner wrap-

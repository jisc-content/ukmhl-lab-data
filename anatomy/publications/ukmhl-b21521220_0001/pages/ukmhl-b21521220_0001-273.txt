This appears from the difleffion of living animals; in which we fee the inner intercodal mufcles operate in the ele- vation of the nbs, and red in the depreffion of them. It allâ€™o appears, from a flexible thread being fixed to the rib of a hu- man fkeleton, and drawn in the fame direction with that of the fibres of the inner intercodal mufcles, by which means the lower rib will be always approximated towards the upper. The greater firmnefs ado of the upper ribs proves this cir- cumdancr, as they ferve for a fixed point to the lower ones : For the fird or uppermod ribs are from eight to twelve times firmer, and lefs moveable, than the lower true ribs ; but the difference of didance in them from the centre of motion is fcarcely the twentieth part of the length of their whole lever. Ladly, the elevating power of the internal intercodal mufcles appears plainly by experiment in a dead fubjefl; when, by the thorax being raifed, the mufcles inftantlv (well. By the y<fcion, therefore, of thefe mufcles, the thorax is e- levated, not altogether as one machine ; nor would refpira- tion be aflided by fuch a motion ; but the ribs turning upon their articulations, though behind they are but little moved, yet the fore part of their extremities defeends, and forms lar- ger angles both with the dernum and vertebrae; but, from thence, in the middle of their arches, by alcending, their lower edges are drawn upward ; at the fame time, the dernum is thrujft out forward more from the vertebrae and from the ribs. Thus the ribs are both removed farther from the ver- tebrae,

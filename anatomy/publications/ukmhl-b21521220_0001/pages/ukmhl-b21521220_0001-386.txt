Part VL 3*4 SECRETION of the BILE. diaphragm, obtufely quadrangular, and furrounded and ter- minated by mere tendons, fo as to be not eafily changeable. \ Having furmounted this opening of the diaphragm, it then immediately expands into the right auricle. The fmaller veins of the liver creeping about its furface are fent into the phrenics, renals, and azygos ; or, at leaft, there is certainly , a communication between thefe and the hepatic veins coming from the portae. That the blood comes from all parts by the vena portaruu* to the portae, is proved by a ligature, by which any vein be- tween thefe parts and the ligature fwelife; but the porta it- feif, above the ligature, grows flaccid and empty. That it afterwards goes through the liver to’ the cava, appears by anatomical injections, which {hew open and free amftomofes I or communications between the vena portarum and the cava ; and by the common nature of the veins going to the cava. Again, the difficult paflage through the vena portarum, like to that of an artery, together with its remotenefs from the. heart, and the oily or fli ggifh nature of the blood itfeif, oc- eafion the blood to ftagnate, accumulate, and form fcirrhous fwellings in no part cftener than in the liver. This danger however is diminiflied by the motion of the adjacent mufcles, and by refpiration •, but jt is increafed by inadivitv, and by four and vifcid aliments. Hitherto, we have been fpeaking of the adult liver, in which both the umbilical vein and the duCtus venofus are empty and doled up, although they con- tinue to cohere with the left branch of the vena portarum. The nerves of the liver are rather numerous than large ; hence, when wounded or inflameJ, it is capable of no very great pain. The lymphatic vcjfels of the liver are numerous, arifing from all Tides, and p-.fli g into the thoracic duCt. Through the whole lubftance of the liver go bundles of biliary veflels, of branches of the vena portarum, and of the » hepatic

AND ITS APPENDAGES. brains of fifli, and efpecially in their thalami optici; but in no part of the human brain does the fibrous nature of the medul- la more evidently appear than in the fornix, efpecially when immerfed in fome of the acids. Again, that the fibres of the brain are continuous with thofe of the nerves, lo as to form one extended and open continuation, appears very evidently in the ieventh, fourth, and fifth pair of nerves. There is a great deal of oil in the medulla, upwards of a tenth part of its whole weight. But here a controverfy begins concerning the nature of thefe fibres, a congeries of which compol’es the fubftance of the medulla and of the nerves. That this is a mere iolid thread, and only watered by a vapour exhaling into the cellular fa- bric which lurrounds the nervous fibres, li3S been aflerted by many of rhe moderns ; but that, when it is ftruck by a fenlible body, a vibration is excited, which is then conveyed to the brain. But the phenomena of wounded nerves will not allow us to imagine the nervous fibres to be folid •, for, if irritation caules a nerve to fliake, (in a manner fomewhat fimilar to an elafiic cord, which trembles when it is taken hold of), the nerve ought to be made of hard fibres, and tied by their extremities to hard bodies : They ought alio to be tenfe ; for neither foft cords, nor fuch as are not tenfe, or fuch. as are not well fattened, are ever obferved to tremulate. But all the nerves at their origin, are medullary, and very foft, and exceedingly far from any kind of tenfion. Where they pafs through channels, and are well guarded, they retain the fame foft texture, and are not covered with membranes ; as the intercoftal nerves, and the fecond nerves of the fifth pair. Borne alfo are foft throughout their whole length, what- ever their fize be. For example, the foft olfaflory and acouftic nerves, from which latt we would moll readily ex- •peft a tremor produced ' “ ^ ’ A in, though the nerves are

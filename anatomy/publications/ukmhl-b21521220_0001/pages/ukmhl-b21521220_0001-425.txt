In this courfe, the vas deferens paffes behind and crofles the neighbouring umbilical artery ; crofles the extremity of the ureter of the lame fide, in its paflage between that extre- mity and the bladder; and having got behind tlie bladder, it meets the vas deferens of the other fide between the infer- tions of the ureters, and they run down together to the neck' of the bladder. This canal, which at the origin of the epidydimis is large and plaited, becomes immediately afterwards fmaller and fmoother, and continues in that form till it gets behind the bladder, where it begins again to be larger, and more une- ven. It arifes from the angular portion or pofterior extremity of the epidydimis; and from thence runs forwards in a very ob- lique courfe, on the poftenor half of the epidydimis, where it is a little incurvated as it joins the back-fide of the iperma- tic veflels. The texture of theTmooth portion of this canal is very fo- lid, and in a manner cartilaginous, cfpecially near the lurface \ of its cavity; which, though very narrow, is ftjll kept open by means of the folidity and thicknefs of its fides. The cavity of the vas deferens is cylindrical, though the whole tube is flat, and its external circumference oval, as r may be feen by cutting it tranfverfely ; and the cavity enlar- ges as it pafies behind the bladder. The termination of thefe canals muff be referred to the hiftory ot the urethra VeficuUie /emulates. The veficulae feminales are loft whi- tifh knotted bodies, about three or lour fingers breadth in length, one in breadth, and about three times as broad as thick, iituated ob iquely between the rectum and lower part of the bladder, in iuch a manner, as that their fuperior ex- tremities

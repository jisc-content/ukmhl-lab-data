The liver is covered exteriorly by a particular membrane or coat, which is a continuation of the peritonaeum. A membranous or filamentary fubftance likewife runs through this whole vifcus, and connects the ramifications and extre- mities of all its vefTcls to each other. This fubftance feems to be a complicated production of the capfula of the veqa portae, and of the external membrane of the liver. The outer furface of this coat is very fmooth, but its in- ner furface is uneven, confiding of a great number of thin membranous laminae ; between which we obferve very dif- tinctly, numerous lymphatic veflels, on both the convex and concave fides of the liver ; but it is more difficult to trace thofe which accompany the filamentary fubftance through that vifcus. Some of the lympathetic veflels, from the fub- ftance and concave furface of the liver, run in the capfule of Gliflon ; and after paffing through conglobate glands fituated there, they end at laft in the receptaculum chyli, or into fome of the large lafteals ; others, upon the convex furface of the liver, run to the ligamentum fufpenforium, from which they pierce the diaphragm in company with the vena cava, to end in the thoracic dutt. We have already obferved, that the fubftance of the liver is chiefly made up of an infinite number of pulpy friable corpufcles ; each of which is bounded, and in a manner fur- rounded, by a particular expanfion of the capfula Glifloni ; and all thefe expanfions are connected by common fepta, in fome meafure refembling a bee*hive. Thefe corpufcles have feveral angles, efpecially in the in- ner furface of the liver ; but near'the furface they are railed in the form of finall tubercles. Their pulpy texture appears like radiated villi, a l'mall void fpace being left in the middle of each. If /

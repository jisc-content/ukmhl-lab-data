lie Part VL THE EYE, mentioned. This art of feeing diftinCtly at different diftan- ces is faid to be learned by experience, it being unknown to thofe who have been lately couched. It is aifo faid, that, in an artificial eye, the ufe and neceflity of this motion may be plainly perceived. Too great a divergency of the rays, as in thofe which come from objects very clofe to the eye, is cor- rected by a removal of the lens farther from the retina, fo as to bring the focus upon the retina itfelf, which would other- wife have fallen behind the eye ; for, the refracting power of the eye being the fame, if the focus of rays coming from the diftance of three feet fall perfectly upon the retina, thofe rays which come from the diftance of three inches will not be collected into a focus at the retina, but beyond it; and rays {till more diverging will meet together yet farther behind the eye, if they are not collected together by a greater refraCting power. But thofe rays which come from very remote objeCts, and which may therefore be counted parallel, will meet together before the retina, in the vitreous humour, and feparate again at their point of concourfe, as if it was a lucid point: To re- medy which, therefore, it is fuppofed that thofe powers above mentioned remove the cryftalline lens back from the cornea nearer to the retina, that the rays may form the focus on the retina: For an eye that will collect the rays coming from feven inches,- fo as to unite them on the retina, will colleCt thofe together before the retina which come from a diftance of three feet. It was therefore perfectly neceflary for the eye to be made thus changeable, that we might be able to fee diftinCtly at various diftances. The point of dif- tinct vifion is in that part of the retina where the given ob- jeCt is painted in the leaft compafs poffibk. The powers cauftng the vifual rays to unite on the retina, are often very different in the two eyes of the fame perfon, the one being Jong-fighted and the other fhort-fighted, Thefe,

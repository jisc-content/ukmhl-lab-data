Chap. IV. UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. 445 to pafs, when the whole uterus is comprefled; and fometimes it appears to have very {mail hairs or villi. Thele villi and holes are obferved to be more or lei's tinged with blood in thofe women who die in the time of their menfes. In the narrow part, which anfwers to the neck, each fide is divided into two lateral parts by a kind of prominent lonÂ« gitudinal line, which is larger in the upper or anterior fide, than in the lower or poflerior. On each fids of thefe two longitudinal lines there are lines or rugae obliquely tranfverle, and dilpuled like branches, the longitudinal lines reprelenting trunks. Between and round thele rugae, there are fmall lacunae, through which a muci- laginous fluid is difcharged that doles the orifice of the ute- rus. We fometimes obferve in the interftices between the rugae, leveral tranfparent globular corpufdes, which vary very much ip fiz'e. Their nature is not yet well underflood: They appear to be filled with a mucous lymph. Naboth con- fidered them as ova. , . Structure of the uterus. The fubftance of the body of the uterus is fpongy and compad, with a copious intertexture of vefiels. Its thicknefs is nearly equal and uniform in tfie fides i and edges; but the fundus is thicker toward the middle than toward the two angles, where the thicknefs decreafes gradu- ally. The edges are likewife much thinner near thefe angles than near the extremity of the neck. The uterus is covered by a portion of the peritonaeum, which' ferves it for a coat, and is the continuation of that which covers the bladder and redum, running up from the \ lower and pofterior part of the bladder, over the anterior part of the uterus, and from thence over the fundus, and down the poflerior fide, and afterwards going to the redum. On each lateral part or edge of the uterus this portion of the peritonaeum forms a broad duplicature, which is extend- ed on each fide, more or lefs diredly to the neighbouring la- teral

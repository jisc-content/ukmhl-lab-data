'4* THE BRAIN, Part VI, ap from the medulla fpinalis through the great occipital fora- men, by the name of nervus aceejfortus oElavi parts, or nervus fpinalis. This additional nerve goes out with that of the eighth pair through the foramen lacerum, lying behind it, but diftinguifhed from it by a membranous feptum. The ninth pair, called nervi byppoglojft externi, hyppoglojft tnajcres, and commonly gufatorii, arile each from the furrow that feparates the corpora olivaria and pyramidalia. Thefe branches foon unite into a trunk which pafles through the anterior condyloid hole; fometimes the branches form two trunks, which, after piercing the dura mater, unite and go through the hole above mentioned. The tenth pair, called nervi fub-occipitales, arife under the ninth pair, chiefly from the anterior, and a little from the la- teral part of the extremity of the medulla oblongata, oppo- lite to the pofterior part of the condyloid apophyfis of the occipital bone, by a Angle plane or fafciculus of fmall fila- ments which pierce the dura mater diredlly from within out- ward, at the fame place where the vertebral arteries perforate it from without inwards. One or two threads frequently come from the back part of the medulla, and are at firfi: fe- parated from the anterior bundle by the nervus acceflorius and ligamentum denticulatum j but afterwards unite with it into one trunk. Nerves of the medulla fpinalis. The nerves formed by the j lateral union of the anterior and poflerior filaments of the medulla fpinalis, go out of the bony canal of the fpina dorfi, j Coward each fide, through the intervertebral holes, through the anterior holes of the os facrum, and the lateral notches of the os coccygis ; and from thence they have the general name of nervi vertebrales. They are divided, in the fame manner as the vertebrae, into feven pair of cervical nerves, twelve pair of dorfal, five pair of lumbar, and five pair of peryi facri. , As !

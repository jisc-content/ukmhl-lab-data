THE MOUTH, Part VI. 5s Very loofe, and formed into irregular folds. It runs in a little on each fide between the edges of the pharynx. Mi/fcles of the pharynx. Though almoft all the mufcular or flelhy portions of which tne pharynx is compofed concur in the formation of one continued bag or receptacle, they are neverthelefs very diftinguilhable from each other, not only by their different infertions, from which they have been de- nominated, but alfo by the different directions of their fibres. They may be looked upon as three digaftric mufcles ; the middle tendons of which lie backward in one longitudinal line, which in fome fubjeCts appears plainly like a linea alba. The loweft of the mufcular fibres make a complete circle backward between the two fidcs of the bafis of the cartilago cricoides. This circle is the beginning of the oefophagus, and has been thought by fome to form a diffinft mufcle, called oefophagus. Befides the mufcles which form the body of the pharynx, there are feveral other fmall ones connected with it; but of thefe fufficient defcriptions have been already given in a former part of the work. The particular ufes of thefe mufcles are very difficult to be determined. It is certain that thofe of the middle and lower portions of the pharynx ferve chiefly for deglutition. Thofe of the upper portion, and fome of thofe of the middle por- tion, may, among other funClions, be ufeful in modifying the voice, according to the opinion of M. Santorini* § 6, The Salival Glands, Isfc. By faliva we mean in general that fluid by which the mouth and tongue are continually moiftened in their natural ftate. This fluid is chiefly fupplied by glands, called, for that reafon, glandulae falivales, of which they commonly rec- kon three pairs, two parotides, two maxillares, and two fub- linguales. Thefe are indeed the largeft, and they furnilh th»

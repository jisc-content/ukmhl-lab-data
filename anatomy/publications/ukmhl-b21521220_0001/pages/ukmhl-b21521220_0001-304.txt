VENTRICULUS. Part VI. goa firengthened by a particular fafciculus which runs along the fmall curvature, its fibres appearing to be tefs oblique than thole of the great plane. The fibres of the inner or circular plane of this mufcular coat are ftronger than thofe of the outer plane. They are rather fegments which unite at different diftances, than entire circles; and they are likewife interfered by great numbers of (mall white lines, in fome meafure tendinous, and very ob- lique, which all together reprefent a kind of net-work, the areolae or melhes of which are very narrow. As thefe circles or fegments advance on the great extre- mity of the fiomach, they diminifh gradually, and form a kind of mufcular vortex; the centre of which is in the mid- dle of that extremity. Between the outer and inner planes, round the fuperior orifice, there are two diftinft planes about the breadth of a finger, and very oblique, which lurround this orifice in op- pofite dire&ions, and interfefl each other where they meet on the two lateral fides. Along the middle of each lateral fide of the fmall extre- mity, there runs a tendinous or ligamentary flat portion, above a quarter of an inch in breadth, which terminates in the pylorus. Thefe two portions lie between the common and mufcular coats, and adhere very ftrongly to the firft. Between the two fame coats, there is a cellular lubflance which adheres very clofely to the external coat, and mfinu- ates itfelf between the fielhy fibres of the fecond, all the way to the third, as may be perceived by blowing it up. Some make it a diftinft goat, and call it tunica cellulofa ; but it is no more than the cellular portion of the membranous coat;, - like the cellular portion of the peritonaeum. The third coat, commonly called tunica nervofa, but pro- perly tunica cellulofa, is compofed of capillary veffels and nerves, with a very large proportion of cellular fubftance. Oa

Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 143 The foft parts of the internal ear are chiefly the membra- na tympani, the periofteum of the tympanum, and of the officula auditus, labyrinth, and of all its cavities, the mem- brana mafloidea interna, the mufdes of the officula, the parts which complete the formation of the Euflachian tube, the arteries, veins, and nerves. We are, however, under a ne- ceffity of beginning by the tuba Euflachiana, for two rea- fons; firft, becaufe the bony parts of that tube are but of very fmall ufe for the knowledge of its whole ftruflure and compofition ; and, fecondly, becaufe we are obliged to men- tion it in defcribing the mufcles. The duEltis aims palatinus, or Euflachian tube, as was ob- ferved in the defcription of the Ikeleton, is a canal or du<T which goes from the tympanum to the pofterior openings of the nares, or nafal fofl'ae, and toward the arch of the palate ; it is dug in the apophyfis perrofa along the carotid canal, and it is lengthened out by the fpinal apophyfis of the os fphenoi- i dale. In its natural ftate, this duel reaches from the cavity of the tympanum to the root or fuperior part of the internal ala of the apophyfis pterygoides; and through this whole courfe it confills of two portions, one entirely bony, and the other partly bony, partly cartilaginous, and partly membra- nous. The bony portion lies through its whole length immedi- ately above the Allure of the glenoid or articular cavity of the os temporis, and terminates at the meeting of the fpinal apophyfis of the os Iphenoides with the pars petrofa of the os temporis. The other or mixed portion reaches in the fame direction from this place to the internal ala of the apophyfis ptery- goides, or to the pofierior and outer edge of the nares. But to form a more exaft idea of it, it will be proper to confider it as divided into four parts, two fuperior and two inferior. The

OMENTUM. Chap. III. V Next the inteftine, each of them forms a broad thin bafis ; and they terminate by irregular papillae, thicker than their bales Tiiele bales are at firft dilpofed longitudinally ; then obi q iely; and, laflly, more or lets traniyeriely, efpecially near the rettum, and upon that intefiine. Thele appendices are for the mod part fepar^ted from each other : but lome of them which have longitudinal bales com- municate together, the veftiges of thele communications being' very narrow, and not very prominent. By blowing through a fmall hole made in or e of thele appendices, it is inflated like a fmall irregular bladder, and the air pafles under the external coat of the colon or rectum. Betides thefe appendices epiploicae, we obferve, at differ- ent dil'tances, along the colon, between the ligamentary band, which lies hid, and one of the other two, that is, on both lides of the adhelion of the mtfoqolon, leveral adipoie llrat3, which may hkewife be confidered as appendices of the lame nature with the former; but thele flrata are very feldom oblerved between the two apparent ligamentary bands of the colon. Vejftls of the omenturji. The arteries and veins of the great omentum are branches of the gaftricae, and, for that realbn, go by the name of gafiro-epjplokae dixtrae and ftnijlrae. The arteries on the right fide anfwer to the hepatic artery, and thofe on the left fide to the fplenic ; and both communicate with the arteria ventriculi coronaria, and refpedively with the arteriae mefentericae. The gaftro-epiplcic veins anfwer in the fame manner of diftribution to the vena portae. The vefiels of the little omentum come chiefly from the coronariae ventriculi; and thofe of the appendices and ilrata are ramifications from the reticular texture of the arteries and veins of the colon and reflum.

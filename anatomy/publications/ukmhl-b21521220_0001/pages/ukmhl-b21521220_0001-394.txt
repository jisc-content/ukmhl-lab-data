SECRETION of the BILE. Fart -VL I -392 pulp, and flowly exprefled from the ftomach by the perifial- tic force of the duodenum’ and preflure of the abdominal mufcles, incorporates them all together•, and the acid or acefcent qualities of the food are in lome meafure thus cor- reCTd, the curd of milk is again diffolvcd by it into a liquid, and the whole mals of aliment inclined more to a putrid al- kaldcent difpofition j it dilTolves the oily matters, fo that they may freely incorporate with the watery parts, and make up an uniform mafs of chyle to enter the lafteals'; the fur- rounding mucus in the inteftines is hereby abfterged and at- tenuated, and their periftaltic motion is excited by its acri- mony; all which offices are confirmed, by obferving the con- trary efteCls from a want or defeat of the bile. Nor is the hej vic bile lufficient to excite the nectffiary motion of the inteftines, if thecyftic is wanting; both which'are of fo much uie and importance to the animal, that we find, by experi- ment, even the ftrongeft animal will perilh in a few days, if the flux of bile to the inteftines be intercepted, by wounding the gall-bladder. The bile defcends flowly along with the alimentary mafs j and having fpent its force, or changed its bittcrnefs by putre- faction, moft of it is afterwards excluded with the feces; but probably lome of the more fubtile, watery, and lefs bitter parts, are again taken up by the abforbents. It returns with difficulty into the ftomach, becaufe of the afcent of the duo- denum, which goes under the ftomach; becaufe of the re- finance it meets with from the valvula pylori •, and becaufe of ' the advancement of the new chyle which the ftomach adds to the former : in man, however, it frequently enters; and always in birds. The bile'is fweet and mild in the foetus ; for in them the'blood feeins not fufficiently charged with ' putrid alkaline vapours, nor are there, any oily or fat fub- ftances ahforOed from,the int-ftines.

DIGESTION. 346 Part VI. fed at the fame time, it is called vomiting; if it is flowly per- formed, it may be called mminatio; if the fmall, and parti- cularly the great inteftines, return their contents upwards, the difeafe is called ileus. The effeÂ£t of vomiting is partly from the preflure of the abdominal mufcles deprefling the falfe ribs, and urging the contents of the abdomen againll the diaphragm ; which, at the fame time, contracting itfelf to a plane downwards, forces the ftomach, as between the fldes of a prefs, to throw up its contents. The aliments driven in their natural courfe to the duode- num, meet there with the influent bile and pancreatic juice, which often flow back into the ftomach. ' A thin watery liquor diftils from the exhaling arteries into the cavity of the intrftines, like the juice of the ftomach, not acrid, but faltifh. The quantity of this liquor may be com- puted from the large extent or fum of all the excretory ori- fices, and from the feCtion of the fecretory artery, which is larger than any other in, the body ; add to this, the laxity of the parts perpetually kept warm and moift, and the copious diarrhoea or watery dilcharge that often follows the ufe of purgative medicines The mucus arifing from the pores or cells, ferves to lubricate and defend the internal furface of the * vilious membrane, and to guard the fenfible nerves from ftrongly acrid or pungent particles. Hence we fee, it is more abundant at the beginning of the larger inteftines, becaufe there the m ifs of aliment begins to be more feculent, acrid, and tenacious. The mixture of this liquor with the pulp like mafs of the aliment, together with the bile and pancreatic juice, is made by the motion of the furrounding muicles of the abdomen ; but this force is lmall, and incapable of moving the aliments forward. The peri (lair ic motion, which is more particularly flrong and evident in the fmall inteftines, is the chief power by which the digefted aliments are propelled along the intef- ' * final

HEART. Chap. II. 23* which the heart a£ts. The heart, therefore, fends a weight of 51 pounds, with the velocity of 149 feet in a minute. The above computation may perhaps be inaccurate, both from the onuffion of iome circumftances that ought to have been taken into the account, and from the inaccuracy of the data ; but that the heart appears to be a very powerful ma- chine, is evident from the great difficulty we have in filling all the red blood-vellels by anatomical injedtions, and the utter impoffibiiity of filling all the l'malier ones j yet the heart, we lee, not only gradually diftends all the larger, the lmaller, 1 nd even the leaft veflels, with blood, but alio drives it forward through them with a considerable velocity. Even in the lealt arteries, the blood is urged forward by the heart with fuch a force as to make the alternate motions of that powerful rnulcle perceptible j even in fuch animals as are icarcely vifible to the naked eye, and in the imali etrj- bryos of infects. And, from lome of the leaft arteries, I have leen the blood ftart icvcral feet, the jet deferibing 3 parabola, whofe height was four feet, and -the .amplitude of projection feven; and fquie apatomifts afl'ert that they have leen the blood alcend from the aorta to the height of twelve feet. - ^ QwJ ^ j,a£ ne q0 et.cnot, Moreover, that we may make a juft eftimate of the lieart’s force in living animals, we muft confider what great refinan- ces that complex mufcle overcomes: We muft compute the enormous weight of the whole niafs of blood j a mafs perhaps of fifty pounds and upwards : For all the quantity of fluids, once fhgnant in a perl'on lately drowned or fainting away, are eafily put into their former motion by the heart alone. We muft alio confider the great decr.eafe of the blood’s velocity, arifing from the greater capacity of the dividing branches; and yet, even in the leaft vellels, its velocity is very conflJerable, as appears by the Sand tor ian perfpiration feen to fly rapidly oft

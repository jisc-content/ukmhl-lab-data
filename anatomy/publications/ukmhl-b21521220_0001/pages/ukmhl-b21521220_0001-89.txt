AND ITS APPENDAGES. *7 Chap. T. touches the cryftalline. This proportion between the two chambers has been (ufficiently proved, contrary to the opi- nion of many ancient writers, by M. Iieilfer, Morgagni, and feveral members of the Royal Academy ; bur none has treat- ed thefe matters at lo great iengih as M. Petit the phylician, as appears by the printed memoirs of that Society. § 5. The Tunica Albuginea, and Mufdes of the Globe of the Eye. _ The tunica albuginea, called commonly the ‘white of the eye, and which appears on all the anterior convex fide of the globe, from the cornea to the beginning of the poflerior fide, is formed chiefly by the tendinous expanfion of the four redi mufdes. This expanfion adheres very clofe to the fcle- rotiea, and makes it appear very white and fhining; whereas the reft: of it is of a dull whitifh colour. It is very thin near the edge of the cornea; in which it I'eems to be loft, termi- nating very uniformly. There are commonly fix mufcles inferted in the globe of the human eye ; and they are divided, on account of their diredion, into four redi and two obliqui. The redi are again divided, from their fituation, into fuperior, inferior, internal, and external ; and, from their fundions, into a le- vator, depreflor, addudor, and abdudor. The two oblique mufcles are denominated from their fituation and fize, one being named obliquus fuperior or major, the other obliquus infe- rior or minor. The obliquus major is likevvife called troch• learis, becaufe it paftes through a finall cartilaginous ring, as over a trochlea or pulley. The mufeuli redi do not altogether anfvver to that 'name; for, in their natural fituation, they do not at all lie in a ftraight diredion, as they are commonly reprefented in an eye taken out of the body. To underftand this, we ought to have a

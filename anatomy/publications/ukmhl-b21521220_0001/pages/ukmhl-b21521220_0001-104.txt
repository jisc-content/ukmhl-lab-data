THE EYE, Part Vf. tot lower part of the orbit, which, going out at the anterior in- ferior orbitary hole, is diftributed to the neighbouring por- tion of the mufculus orbicularus, and communicates with a ramus of the portio dura. The reft of the luperior maxillary nerve fhall be deferibed afterwards. The portio dura of the feventh pair, or auditory nerve, gives branches to the luperior, inferior, and external lateral parts of the orbicularis palpebrarum ; one of which commu- nicates with the nervus 1’uperciliaris, and another with the fub-orbitarius, to be afterwards deferibed. §il. Sight. The eye is the organ of vifion. The greater part of it is compofed of pellucid humours capable of refracting the rays of light. t he complexity of this organ is neceffary for the defence of its tender parts; and the diverlity of the leveral humours, together with the various offices which this curious machine performs, necelfarily required a very compound in- ftrument. Outwardly, a defence is afforded to this organ by the eye- brow or fnpercilium ; and the thick hairs placed there, which are capable of being pulled down by the adtion of the frontal, corrugator, and orbicular mufcles afford a lhade to the eye in too ftrong a light. A depreffion of the eye-brow ferves alfo to exprefs concern of the mind, as an elevation of it denotes the mind to be in a ferene quiet ftate. This guard alfo con- duces to throw off the fweat and retained duft, or the inl'eCts which might fall into the eye. The palpebrae are the peculiar guards of the eye; and that they might Unit the more exactly for the defence of this fenfible and delicate organ, their margins are furniihed with cartilaginous arches, which, accurately correfponding with each other, form a tight and unwrinkled future. The cartilage of each alfo hinders it from being drawn into wrin- kles,

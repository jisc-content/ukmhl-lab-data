'454 UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. Part VE T. hey are of a fpongy fubftance, intermixed with glands, feveral of which may be perceived by the naked eye. Their fituation is oblique, their upper extremities lying near each other, and the lower at a much greater dillance. In married women they are more or lei's flaccid and decayed. XJrdhra. By the urethra in females, we mean the urinary duff, the orifice of which is between the nyrnphae below the. glans of the clitoris, l he fides of this orifice are a little prominent and wrinkled, and perforated by fmall lacunae, from which a vifeid or mucilaginous liquor may be Iqueezed. In time of pregnancy, this orifice is fometimes drawn a little inward.

It pafles under the cartilaginous arch of the ofia pubis, and terminates by an oblique opening at the neck of the bladder, being bent a little downwards be- tween its two extremities. i The internal membrane of the urethra is a little plaited, and perforated by fmall holes, which communicate with foi- liculi, lying hid in its fubftance, as in males. If we blow into one of thefe holes, we obferve a fmall canal to be inflated, which runs from without inwards, and terminates in fome places by a kind of facculus, by compreffing which 4 viicid liquor is difeharged.

Part Vf- 338 DIGESTION. The beft dn is afforded by pure water, not incorporated with halts, nor with air, which may excite fermentations. Of this kind vve juflly prefer that from a mountainous fpring7 which runs through a Tandy bed, and which is cold, clear, light, and infipid \\ henever we are unprovided with fuch pure water, as is frequently the cafe in low flat countries, or when any increafe of the ftrength and mufcular conflri£tion of the flomach is required from a fpicy ftimulus, i*s place may be very well fupplied by wine, prepared chiefly from grapes •, but, in defett of thof*-, from apples and pears •, which, after a due fermentation, becomes clear, and is replenifhcd with an acid fait, and oily or inflammable fpirit, well diluted with water. Tiq ors of the fame kind, replete with a vipous or inflammable fj irit, but more flatulent, heavy, and lefs pa- latable, are extracted by boiling water from grain of different kinds previoufly malted, and prepared by fermentation, as fubflitutes for wiae in tliofe countries where the grape does not ripen. Mankind have invented various pickles and fauces, as fait, vinegar, and acids of various kinds, to correct the purrefeent difpofitioh of fielh-meats ; and pepper, and other hot ipices, to flrengthen the action of the flomach, which is perpetually weakened by the ufe of vegetables : To thefe we may add fusar, and the caflern fpices, which are generally ufed either for the fake cf flavouring or preferving our food. But all thefe yield no ncuriflnneht, being deliitute of all gelatinous lymph, or any farinaceous quality. fhe aliments are v&rioufly prepared, according to the dif- ference of c»untrv, climate, or lealon ; and thus their crudity is removed, t'h.ir folid fibres foftened, their fuperfluous air excelled, arid their difagreeable acrimony changed and ren- der cl agreeable. But even after this, many vegetable foods, an ' more el'perialiy flelh meats, require to be divided, iu fome degree, by previous maftication, which is particularly nccefurv

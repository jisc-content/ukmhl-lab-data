THE EYE, Part VI. The ihe other ufes attributed to thefe mufcles feem to be with- out foundation, from the confideration of their infertions, and of the ftrudture of the parts with which, they are con- cerned ; both which reafons are explained in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1721. ยง 6. 2 he Super cilia, and Mufculi Frontalest Occipitaleiy and Superciliares. Supercilia. The fupercilia, or eye-brows, peculiar to the human fpecies, are the two hairy arches fituated at the lower part of the forehead, between the top of the nofe and tem- ples, in the fame dire&ion with the bony arches which form the fuperior edges of the orbits. The fkin in which they are fixed does not feem to be much thicker than that of the X \ reft of the forehead ; but the membrana adipofa is thicker than on the neighbouring parts. The colour of the eye- brows is different in different perfons, and often, in the fame perfon, different from that of the hair on the head ; neither is the lize of them always alike. The hairs of which they confift are ltrong and rather ftiff, and they lie obliquely, their roots being turned to the nofe, and their points to the tem- ples. The fupercilia have motions common to them with thofe of the fkin of the forehead, and of the hairy fealp. By thefe motions the eye-brows are lifted up ; the fkin of the fore- head is wrinkled more or lefs regularly and tranfverfely ; and the hair and almoft the whole fealp is moved, but not in the fame degree in all perfons; for fome people by this mo- tion alone can move their hat, and even throw it off their head. The eve-brows have likewife particular motions which contract the fkin above the nofe; and all thefe different mo- tions are performed by the occipital, frontal, and fuperciliary mufcles.

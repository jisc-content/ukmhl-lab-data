314 INTESTINUM JEJUNUM. Part Vj. convolutions, which lie chiefly in the upper part of the um- bilical region. Through all this courfe it is conne&ed to the mefentery, in the manner that fhall be explained hereafter. It is a difficult matter to fix the exaCt bounds between this inteftine and the ileum. The external marks of a redder colour ih the one than the other, though generally common, are not conflant; and the internal marks fixed from the plu- rality of valvulae eonniventes are indeterminate, and often- times appear only from diffcCtion. Thefe two inteftines may be better diftinguifhed by their different fituations, which are very regular ; but, as even this mark is not particular enough, the moft eafy way that I have been able to contrive, and which will, in moft cafes, be found fufficiently exaCt, is to divide both inteftines into five parts, and to allow nearly two-fifths to the jejunum, and three-fifths and a little more to the ileum. Structure of the jejunum. The coats of the jejunum are nearly of the fame ftruclure with thofe of the duodenum, but thinner. The common coat is a continuation of the me- fentery j and the cellular fubftance is in lefis quantity than in the duodenum, and indeed fieems to be altogether wanting along the great curvature cf the convolutions, where the Ion. gitudinal fibres of the mulfcular coat adhere very elofely to the external membrane. This mul'cular coat is not fo ftrong as that of the duode- num. Tne longitudinal plane of fibres is very thin, and al- moft imperceptible, except along the great curvature, oppo- fite to the connection of the mefentery, where we fee, through the membranous coat, a kind of whitifh ligamentary band, about the third part of an inch in breadth, which is continued along the great curvature of all the convolutions of this inteftine, and of the ileum. This ligamentary band is like thofe which we obferve oa the Tides of the fmall extremity of the ftomach. It adheres perfectly

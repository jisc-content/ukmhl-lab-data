*3Â° THE EAR, Part VI. of the ear, this cartilage is wanting. On the backfide, it fliews all the eminences and cavities of the forefide in an op- pofite fituation with refpeft to each other, except the fold of the great circumference; and it confifts ortfy of one piece from that circumference all the way to the meatus externus, except at the two extremities of the folded part of the helix, where there are two fmall feparate portions connected to the great cartilage only by the integuments. The cartilaginous portion of the external meatus audito- rius does not make a complete circle, but rather a fhort tube, in one fide of which there is a break, and which terminates in an oblique border fixed to the edge of the bony canal by feveral fmall inequalities ; and, in confequence of this obli- quity, the cartilaginous border terminates downward in a kind of apex or point. The lateral break in this cartilage is between the upper and back part of its circumference; and on each fide thereof the cartilaginous edges are rounded. There are likewife two or three other lmall incilures in this circumference, which, in regard to the meatus, reprefent ob- liquely tranfverfe fiflures. The anterior fiiTure is in a manner quadrangular, neither are the intermediate parts always op- pofite to each other, for the uppermoft is a little further from the os temporis than the pofterior. The external ear is fixed to the cranium, not only by the cartilaginous portion of the meatus already mentioned, but alfo by two ligaments, one anterior, the other pofterior. The anterior ligament is fixed by one extremity to the root of the apophyfis zygomadca of the os temporis, at the anterior and a little toward the fuperior part of the meatus ofleuf, clofc to the corner of the glenoid cavity; and by the other extre- mity, to the anterior and fuperior part of the cartilaginous meatus. The pofterior ligament Is fixed by one end to the root of the maftoid apophyfis ; and by the other, to the pofterior part

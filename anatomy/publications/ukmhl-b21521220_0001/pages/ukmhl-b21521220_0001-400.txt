398 Part VI. KIDNEYS and URETERS. pillae which lie therein; and fometimes we find two or three papillae in the fame infundibulum. At the place where thefe infundibula furround the bales of the papillae, they fend productions into the medullary or ra- diated lubltance of the kidney, which accompany the blood- veffels, ami ferve for cap!ides or vaginae to all the vafeuiar arches, both arterial and venal, and to their different ramifi- cations, quite through the cortical fubftance, and as far as the furface of the kidney. Ureters. After the infundibula have contracted in a coni- cal form round the apices of the papillae, each of them forms a fmall fhort tube or gullet, which uniting at different diltan- ecs along the bottom of the finus of the kidney, form three large tubes which go out from the finus, ,in an oblique direc- tion from above downwards, and immediately afterwards unite into one trunk. This trunk becomes a very long canal, called the ureter. In men, the three tubes fupply the place of what is called the pelvis in brutes, and might more properly be called the roots or branches of the ureters than the pelvis; which name would-agree belt to the trunk, as being larger than the reft of the ureter. The ureters are commonly two in number, one for each kidney; but fometimes there are more than two. The {iteration of the trunk, and of the roots and branches of each ureter, with refpeCt to the renal artery and vein, is in the following manner: The artery is in the upper par! of the finus, and partly before the vein. The vein is about the middle, and between the artery and ureter. The ureter is in the lower part, a little behind the vein, and it is partly fur- rounded by one branch of the artery. This difpofition appears plainer near the anterior than near the pofterior fide of the kidney, becaufc this lafl is broader than the former; and we likewife fee there the three branches.

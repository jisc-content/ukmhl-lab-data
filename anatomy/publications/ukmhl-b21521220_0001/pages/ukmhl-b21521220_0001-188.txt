THE MOUTH, Part VL iS5 tid gland, to which they give branches; and the facial artery and vein pafs over its du£l. The maxillary glands are fmaller and rounder than the pa- rotides ; and are fituated each on the inlide of the angle of the lower jaw, near the mufculus prerygoidaeus inferior. From the infide, or that which is turned to the mufculus liyo-gloflus, each ot them fends out a duct in the lame man- ner as the parotides; but it is fmaller and longer, and goes by the name of duElus falivalis Whartbni, or duchts inferior. This duct advances on the fide of the mufculus genio- glofius, along the inner part and fuperior edge of the glan- dula fublingualis, to the fraenum of the tongue, where it ter- minates by a fmall orifice, in form of a papilla. The glandulae fublinguales are likewife two in number, of the fame kind with the rormer, oniy Imaller, foniething ob- long, and Hatted like a blanched almond. They are fituated under the anterior portion of the tongue, one on each fide, near the lower jaw, on the lateral portions of the mufculi mylo-hyoidaei which fuflain them. The two extremities of each gland are turned backward and forward, and the edges obliquely inward and outward. They are covered on the upper fide by a very thin mem- brane, which is a continuation of the membrane that covers the under fide of the tongue. They fend out laterally feveral fmall fhort duels which open near the gums by the fame number of orifices, all arranged in the fame line, at a fmall diftance from the fraenum, and a little more backward. In many animals ^ we find particular duels belonging to thefe glands, like thofe of the glandulae maxillares, but they are not to be found fo diflinclly in men- The mufculi genio- plofli lie between the two fublingual glands, and alfo between the two maxillary du£ls. The arteries and veins of thefe, and of the former glands, belong to the -lingual veffels, and the nerves are from the lingual branch of the fifth pair.

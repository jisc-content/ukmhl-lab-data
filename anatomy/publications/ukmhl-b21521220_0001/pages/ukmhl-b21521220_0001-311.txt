INTESTINES. 3®9 Chap. III. The This is commonly termed the common cent>• and it has a cellular fubllance on its inner furface, like that of the fto- jnach, which M. Ruylch thought fit to call a diftindt coat by the name of tunica cellulofa. The iccond coat of the inteftines is flelliy or mufcular? and made up of two planes; one external, the other internal. The external plane is very thin, and its fibres longitudinal j the internal plane is thicker, and its fibres run tranfverfely round the circumference of the inteftinal cylinder. It would appear that thefe fibres are neither fpiral, nor arc they formed of pe: fe£t circles or of rings ; but they deem rather to be fegments of circles, dilpoled much in the fame manner as in the flomach, and thus lurrounding entirely the inter- nal canal. Thefe two planes adhere clofely together, and are fepa- rated with great difficulty. They adhere likewife to the common coat by the intervention of the cellular fubftance, which is in greater quantities on the fide next the mefentery than on the other. The third coat is called nervofa, and is fomething like that of the flomach. It has a particular plane, which ferves as a balls to fullain it, made up of very fine ftrong, oblique fibres, which feem to be of the ligamentary or tendinous kind. To fee this plane diftinflly, a portion of the inteftines mud be inflated, the common coat removed, and the flelliy fibres feraped off. This coat fuftains two reticular fubftances, which are both vafcular, one arterial, the other venal, accompanied by a great number of nervous filaments. Thefe veffels and nerves are produdlions of the mefenteric veffels and nerves •, and, as they furround the whole canal of the inteftines, fome anatomifts have formed them into a diftinft coat, by the name of tunica •va/culofa.

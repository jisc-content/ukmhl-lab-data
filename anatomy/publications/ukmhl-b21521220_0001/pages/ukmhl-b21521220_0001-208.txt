106 THYMUS.. Part VI. with the great fympathetic nerves, and but very little with the eighth pair. U/e. The pleura ferves in general for an inner integument to the cavity of the thorax. The mediaftinum cuts off all communication between the two cavities, and hinders one lung from prefiing on the other when we lie on one fxde. It likewife forms receptacles for the heart, pericardium, oefo- phagus, &c. j and it is continued over the lungs in the man- ner which fhall be explained hereafter. Before we leave the pleura, it mull be obferved, that it adheres firmly to the ribs. This adheGon keeps the pleura ftretched, and hinders it from flipping or giving way. It likewife renders this membrane extremely fenflble of the leaft reparation caufed by coagulated lymph or accumulated blood; the nervous filaments being likewife, in this cafe, very much comprefled in infpiration by the fwelling of the intercoftal mufcles. ยง I. Thymus. The thymus is an oblong very foft glandular body, round on the upper part, and divided below into two or three great lobes, of which that toward the left fide is the longeft. In the foetus it is of a large fize, lefs in children, and in aged perfons very little. In children it is of a white colour, fome- times mixed with red j but, in an advanced age, its colour is generally dark. The greateft part of the thymus lies between the duplica- ture of the fuperior and anterior portion of the mediaftinum, and the great veflfels of the heart ; from whence it reaches a little higher than the tops of the two pleurae, fo that fome part of it is out of the cavity of the thorax; and in the foe- tus and in children, it lies as much without, as within the thorax, and is then compofed of numerous lobules, each inclofed

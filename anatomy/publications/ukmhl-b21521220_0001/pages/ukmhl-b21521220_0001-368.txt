Part VI. VESSELS of the LIVER. 366 enters that canal which opens into the trunk of one of the great hepatic veins of the vena cava near the diaphragm. 1 The hepatic vena portae gives off commonly five large branches into the liver, viz. three from its right extremity into the great lobe, and two from its left extremity into the fmall lobe ; and from the interface between thefe a fmall branch, goes directly to the middle of the convex fide of the liver. The hepatic veins are commonly two or three large branch- es, which go into the trunk of the vena cava by one common opening, elpecially two of them. In the fubftance of the liver, they interfeCt the branches of the hepatic vena portae, and are ramified in all directions, in the manner already ex- plained. The inferior portion of the opening of thefe veins into the vena cava, forms a kind of femilunar valve. Below thefe hepatic veins, the vena cava inferior, in its paflage by the liver, receives feveral other fmall hepatic veins, which feem to have the fame relation to the hepatic artery, as the great veins to the vena portae. , The paflage of the vena cava is through the right portion of the pofterior finus of the liver, and confequently on the fide of the great lobe, which is hollowed at this place lufh- ciently to give paflage to the vein, of which it furrounds a- bout three-fourths, fometimes more, and fometimes the ' whole. • s This paflage anfwers to the interftice between the lobulus and the reft of the great lobe ; and its direction is, in the natural ftate, from below upwards, and a little from left to „right : But, when the liver is viewed extra fitum, and inver- ted, it appears very oblique ; but ftill it ferves as a guide to beginners, who are very apt to be miftaken in examining an inverted liver.

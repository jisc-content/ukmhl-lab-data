I. cartilages gradually harden and oflify, though not equally jfoon in all perfons : And this change happens not only in the cartilago thyroides, but alio to the cricoides and aryte- noides. The mufculi fterno-thyroidaei ferve in general to pull down the thyroid cartilage, and the whole larynx along with it. They may likewii'e affill the fterno-hyoidaei in its action, and comprefs the thyroid gland ; of which hereafter. The ■ thyro-hyoidaei may, as occafion requires, either draw up the larynx toward the cs hyoides, or draw that bone downward toward the cartilago thyroides. It is difficult to determine the ufe of the crico-thyroidaei from their fituation. They may either pull the cricoides ob- liquely backward, or the thyroides obliquely forward; and by this aftion the inferior cornua of the thyroides, and fmall articular furfaces of the cricoides, mull Hide upon each other. Both the lateral and pofterior crico-arytenoidaei may fe- parate the arytenoid cartilages, and thereby open or dilate the glottis; but they do not both perform this aiftion in the fame manner. The lateral mufcles feparate thefe cartilages obliquely forward, and at the fame time loofen or relax the fides of the glottis ; but the pofterior mulcles feparate them obliquely backward, and at the fame time ftretch or extend the fides of the glottis; and when both mufcles a£l equally, they feparate the cartilages dire£lly. The thyro-arytenoidaei atting together, draw both th® arytenoid cartilages forward, and confequently loofen the glottis, and render it capable of the fmalleft quaverings of the voice. They may likewife probably comprefs the lateral firtufes or ventricles of the larynx, and alfo the arytenoid glands. The arytenoidaei bring the arytenoid cartilages clofe toge- ther, and prefs them againft each other ; and when the car- VoL. II, 51 tilages

Part VI. 22Z HEAR T. back, however, on both fides, if there happens to be any ob- ftacle in the lungs. The ufe of the valvulae tricufpides is fufficiently evident ; for the right auricle being contracted, the blood is forced through the auricular orifice, and, like a wedge, feparates the pendulous portions of the valves, and prefies them to the lides of the heart; while the uppermoft valve lhuts the pul- monary artery, left the blood, by the weak impulfe of the auricle, Ihould flow into that artery : I he blood thus receiv- ed, and confined within the right ventricle of the heart, is, by its ftrong contraction, powerfully expelled into the artery. The fcnfible flefh of the heart, being irritated by the quan- tity and weight of this warm blood, is thereby loheited to a contraction : For that the heart, being irritated, will contraCt itfelf in a perfon dying, or even lately dead, is proved by in- jections of water, and inflations of air, whereby the heart, then quiefeent, is recalled to its motion. The fibres of the heart, like other mufcles, are furnifhed with nerves of various origin, in great abundance. That thefe nerves conduce powerfully to move the heart is highly probable, from a confideration of the common na- ture of mufcles; from the increafe which follows in the heartâ€™s motion by irritating the eighth pair of nerves, either at the brain or the fpinal medulla; and from the langour that enfues upon tying thefe nerves, which proves fatal, either fuddenly or within a few days, even though the ligature be made only on a few of them ; for the intercoftal, and efpe- cially thofe from the ganglion of the upper thoracic, canuot be tied. But that there are ftill other caufes, befides that of the ner- ves, conducing to the motion of the heart, we are perfuaded from obferving its motion undifturbed by the irritation of all the nerves in the living animal; from its remaining after the greateft wounds of the head, and even of the cerebellum and

The cheeks and lips form the fides and entry of the cavity of the mouth. They are formed in general by the connec- tion of feveral fiefhy portions of different breadths, fixed round the convex fides of the two jaws, covered on the out- fide with the fkin and fat, and lined on the infide by a glan- dular membrane. Befides all this, the lips feem likewile to have a fat loft fppngy fubftance in their compofition, which fivells and 1'ubfides on certain occafions, independently of the action of the mufcles belonging to them. The fubftance which forms the red border of the lips is very different from the reft of the fkin, being a collection of very fine, long, villous papillae, clofely connedled together, and covered by a fine membrane, which feems to be both a continuation of the epidermis, and of that pellicle which covers the glandular membrane of the cavity of the mouth. This fubftance is extremely fenfibie, and very painful when the outer membrane is by any accident deftroyed. The in- ternal membrane of the upper lip forms a fmall middle frae- num above the firft dentes inciforii. The gums are that reddifh fubftance which covers the two fides of the whole alveolary border of both jaws, infinu- ates itfelf between all the teeth, furrounds the collar of each tooth in particular, and adheres very ftrongly to them. Therefore the outer and inner gums are continuous, and both together form juft as many openings as there are teeth. The fubftance of the gums is of a very lingular ftrudlure, refembling, in fome meafure, the texture of a hat, fuppofed to be very compact and elaftic. It is not immediately fixed to the bones of the jaws, but by the intervention of the peri.- ofteum.

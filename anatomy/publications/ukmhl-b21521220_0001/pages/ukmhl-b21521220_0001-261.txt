Chap .11. LUNGS. 259 other. The greatefl part of this admirable ftrutjture is the difcovery of the iliuftrious Malpighi. Blood-vejfels. The blood-veflels of the lungs are of two kinds ; one common, called the pulmonary artery and veins > the other proper, called the bronchial arteries and veins. '1 he pulmonary artery goes out from the right ventricle of the heart; and its trunk, having run1 dire&ly upward as high as the curvature of the aorta, is divided into two lateral branches ; one going to the right, called the right pulmonary artery; the other to the lett, termed the left pulmonary artery. The right artery pafles under the curvature of the aorta, and is confequently longer than the left. They both run to the lungs, and are difperled thrpugh their whole fubftance by ra- mifications nearly like thole of the bronchia, and lying in the fame directions. The pulmonary veins having been difiributed through the lungs in the fame manner, go out on each fide, by two great branches, which open laterally into the refervoir or mulcular bag of the right auricle. The ramifications of thefe two kinds of veffels in the lungs are furrounded every where by the cellular fubftance already mentioned, which likewite gives them a kind of vagina ; and the rete mirabile ot Malpighi, deferibed above, is formed by the capillary extremities of thefe velfels. It mult be obier- ved, that the ramifications of the arteries are more numerous and larger than thofe of the veins, which, in all other parts of the body, exceed the arteries, both in number and fize. Bronchial arteries and veins. Befides thefe capital blood- veflels, there are others called the bronchial arteries ana veinst which are very fmall, but they follow the bronchia thiough all their ramifications. They communicate with the pulmo- nary arteries and veins in many places ; and likewile with the arteries and veins of the oefophagus, and with the branches of the coronary artery and veijj. TUft

AND ITS APPENDAGES. 55 Chap. I. The firft two branches uniting foon after their origin, form the arteria fpinalis anterior, which runs down within the ca- nal ot the vertebrae, along the anterior groove of the me- dulla. The other two f'mall branches are inverted on the fides of the medulla oblongata, and from thence running backward, they unite much in the fame manner with the firft two, and form the arteria fpinalis potferior, which runs down along the pofterior groove or the medulla fpinalis. The two fpinal arteries, in their cou fe downward along the medulla, fend off on each fide lateral ramifications, by which they frequently communicate with each other, and with the vertebral, intercoftal, lumbar, and facral arteries j fometimes they feem to be fplit for a little way, and then unite again. The veins of the cerebrum and cerebellum, &x. may, in general, be confidered as not only forming the longitudinal finus of the dura mater, and the two great lateral finufes, but alfo all the inferior finules of that membrane ; in all which finufes the veins terminate by different trunks, in the manner already faid in the defcription of the great fuperior finus. Their principal ramifications accompany all the cor- tical circumvolutions of the cerebrum, and directions of the ftrata of the cerebellum, running always in the duplicature of the pia mater. The veins of the plexus choroides, in ge- neral, are of the number of thofe already mentioned. The veins of the medulla fpinalis terminate partly in the fuperior extremities of the two vertebral veins, partly in the two venal ropes termed firms veiiof, which run down lateral- ly on the convex fide of the production of the dura mater, and form, at different diltances, reciprocal communications, by femiannular arches, as by fo many fubordinate finufes. The two longitudinal finufes communicate likewife in their paffige with the vertebral veins, in the fame manner as the neighbouring arteries. From

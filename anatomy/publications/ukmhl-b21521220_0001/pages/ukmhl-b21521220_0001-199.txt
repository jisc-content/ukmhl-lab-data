Chap. II. HI THORAX CHAP. II. Of the Thorax. BY the thorax we commonly underftand all that part of the body which anfwers to the extent of the fternum, ribs, and vertebrae of the back, both outwardly and inward- ly- The thorax is divided into the anterior part, called com- monly the breajl; the pofterior part, called the back; and the lateral parts, called the right and leftfdes. The external parts of the thorax, befides the fkin and membrana adipofa, are principally the mammae ; and the mufcles which cover the ribs, and fill the fpaces between them. The mufcles are the peclorales majores and minores, fub- clavii, ferrati majores, ferrati fuperiores poftici, latifiimi dorfi, and vertebrales; and to thefe we may add the mufcles which cover the fcapula. The internal parts of the thorax are contained in the large tavity of that portion of the trunk which the antients called the middle venter, but the moderns name it limply the cavity of the breaf. This cavity is lined by a membrane named pleura, which forms the mediaftinum; and contains the heart ' and lungs, with the vcfiels, &.c. which go in or from them : Through it, likewife, the oefophagus paffes to the ffcomach ; and part of the nerves are contaiaÂ»d in it which go to the contents of the abdomen.

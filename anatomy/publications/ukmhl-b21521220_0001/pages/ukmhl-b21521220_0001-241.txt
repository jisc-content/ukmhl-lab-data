From the red part of the blood, fibres are generated in a-* bundsnce; from the lerum, in fmaller quantities. Ihey arc ; procured by pouring the blood into a linen-cloth, and wafh- i ing it gradually with a great deal of water, or by beating it â– with a rod. In quantity, they, equal the 28th part of the 1 whole maf's. Thefe are formed of the gluten, and are not ge- nerated in a living animal; fince they are neither to be per- ceived by the microlcope, which fo eafily renders viable the. red globules; nor yet does their long thread-iike figure feem adapted for receiving motion. From the preceding experiments compared together arifes that knowledge which we at prefent have ot the blond; namely, that the craffamentum or cruor is compofed ot glo- bules. The inflammable or combuftible nature of thefe glo- bules is proved from dried blood, which takes flitne and burns; as alfo from the pyrophorus, which is generated from the human blood : And from globules alfo moil probably a. , rifes the greater part of the pitchy oil that is obtained from blood by the violence of fire. * The ferum of the blood diftilled with a ftrong fire gives over almoft the fame principles with the cruor, viz fait, oil, and earth. It yields, however, much more water but no iron at all. Similar principles, but with a lefs proportion of oil and fait, are obtained from the aqueous humours prepared from the blood, as the faliva and mucus. The exadt mafs or quantity of blood contained in the whole body cannot be certainly computed. The weight of the mafs of humours, however, is much greater than that of the folids; but many of them, as the gluten and fat of parti- ticular parts, do not flow in the circulation. But, if we may be allowed to form a juJgment from thole profufe haemor- -*hagies that have been fuftained without deftroying. the life of'

The half arches are chiefly made up of feveral fl it flelhy portions, almoft in the fame manner with the body of the ‘feptum. The membrane which covers them is thinner than the other parts of it towards the palate, pharynx, and tongue. Each portion is a diffindi mufcle, the greateff part of which terminates by one extremity in the fuhflance of the leptuin and of the half arches, and by the other extremity in parts different from thefe. As anatomifls uted formerly to aferibe all thefe mufcles, as far as they knew them, to the uvula, without any regard to the feptum, they termed them in general either ptery.jlapby- liniy or peri-ftaphylim. The laft part of thefe two compound words exprtfles the uvula : The firft part of the firft word is an abridgement of ptery-goides, and exprefles the i ifertion of thefe mufcles ; but the firit part of the fecond word figni- fies no more than round, or about, gcc. We might make ule of the term periJlaphylinus as a general denomination for the mufcles belonging to the feptum, and then add the other terms, of whioh thefe -names have been made up by modern writers. But the reader will find it more agreeable to ufe the names exprelfed in the treatife on the mufcles already described. Of the mufcles of the palate we have f und the conftric- tores ifthmi, faucium, palato phyryngei, tenlores palati, leva- lores palati, and azygos uvulae. The feptum palati ferves to conduft the lacrymal lymph, and that which is continually Wledted on the arch of the palate, into the pharynx. It ferves for a valve to hinder what we (wallow, and efpecially what we drink, from return- ing by the nofe. § 3' Vol. IE X

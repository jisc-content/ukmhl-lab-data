II. inclofed in a thin covering, and united together by cellular fubflance: Thefe are hollow within, and communicate to-* gether fomewhat like the cells of the lungs; but they contain a milky fluid, which readily appears after an opening is made, but this fluid vanifhes foon after birth. Among the various opinions about the ufe of this fubflance, fome have thought it ferved only to fill a part of the thorax of the foetus in the collapfed ftate of the lungs, becaufe its fize decreafes after the lungs are dilated. Its particular inward ftruflure and fecretions are not as yet fufficiently known, fo as to enable us to determine its ufes ; which, however, feem to be defigned more for the foetus than for adults. It has veflels belonging to it, called arteriae and venae thymicae; which are branches from the laryngaea infe- rior and mammaria interna. ยง 5. Pericardium. The heart, with all the parts belonging to it, is contained in a membranous capfula, called pericardium, which is in fome meafure of a conical figure, and fbmewhat bigger than the heart; but the difference muff be lefs during life when the heart is full of blood. It is not fixed to the bafis of the heart, but round the large veins above the auricles, before they fend off the ramifications, and round the large arteries, before their divifions. The pericardium is made up of three laminae, the middle and chief of which is compofed of very fine tendinous fila- ments, which are beft feen in old pcrfons; they are clofely interwoven, and crofs each other in different directions. The internal lamina feems to be a continuation of the outer coat of the heart, auricles, and great veflels. The trunks of the aorta and pulmonary artery have one common cgat, which contains them both as in a fheath, and is lined on the infid* by

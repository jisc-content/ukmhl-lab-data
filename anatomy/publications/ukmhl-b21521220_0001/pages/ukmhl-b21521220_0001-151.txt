AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. the internal foramen auditorium Two veins carry the prin- cipal part of the blood from the labyrinth ; one goes off from the cochlea, near its aqueduft, and ends in the lateral finus ; the other Ijes near the aqueduft of the vedibule, and carries the blood from that cavity, and from the femicircular canals, into the beginning of the internal jugular vein, by a triangu- lar opening The portio mollis of the auditory nerve ends, by its trunk, at the great foffula of the internal auditory hole, from whence the filaments pafs through leveral lmall hobs in the bafis of the cochlea, to be difiributed through die cochl.a, the vefiti- bule, and the femicircular canals. See Monro on the Ner- vous Syftem, Tab. XXIX. XXX. XXXI. Hie portio dura runs firft of all into the frnall foffula of the foramen auditorium internum, then paffes through the whole bony duff called aquaeduElus Fallopii, and comes out again through the ftylo-maltoid hole of the os temporis. In this couri'e it communicates with the dura mater on the upper or anterior fide of the apophyfis petrofa, at the place where the bony duct is interrupted. Having reached behind the frnall pyramid in the bottom of the tympanum, this nerve (ends a finall filament to the mufcle of the ftapes; and, a little before it goes out by the ftvlo-maftoid hole, it gives off another more confiderabie fila- ment, which enters the tympanum from behind forward, paffes between the long leg of the incus and handle of the malleus, and afterwards runs crofs the whole breadth of the tympanum a little obliquely, and goes out at the (ame place at which the tendon of the anterior mufcle of the malleus enters. This frnall nerve is generally called chorda tympani, becaufe in its paffage through the tympanum it has been compared to the cord of a drum. Having left the cavity of the inter- nal ear, it advances toward one fide of the bafis of the tongue, ivhere

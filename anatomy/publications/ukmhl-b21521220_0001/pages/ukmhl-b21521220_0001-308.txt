306 VEN TRI CULUS. Part VI* ticular areolae larger, and their external communications more frequent. Nerves of the Jlotnach. Between the common and mufculai* coats of the ftomach, we find a great number of nerves of dif- ferent fizes. Many of them accompany each other, in form of a broad flat fafciculus, along the fmall curvature of the fto- mach from the iuperior to the inferior orifice. The reft are fpread in different directions, on the fides, extremities, and great curvature, forming at different diftances a kind of reti- cular plexus, from which a great number of filaments are de- tached to the inner coats. They arile chiefly from the nervi fvmpathetici medii, of eighth pair, by means of the plexus ccronarius ftomachicus formed round the fuperior orifice of the ftomach, by the ex- panfion of the extremities of two large ropes, which run down upon the oefophagus, by the name of nervi Jlomachici. The great fympathetic nerve, commonly called interccJhtUsy con- tributes likewif'e to them, by communicating filaments, which the plexus ftomachicus receives from the femilunar ganglions of the plexus bepaticus, and particularly from the plexus fple- niefas. See Walterâ€™s beautiful and accurate Tables of the Nerves, of the Thorax, and Abdomen. Ufes of the Jitmaeh. The ftomach receives in general what- ever the mouth and tongue feed thither through the canal of the oefophagus : But its particular ufe is to receive the ali- ments ; to contain them for a longer dr fhorter time, in pro- portion as they are more folid or fluid ; and to digeff t^iem, that is, to put them in a condition to be turned into that nu- tritious fluid called chyle. This operation, which goes by the general name of digef- tion, and by which chylification begins, is performed partly by the fuccus gaftricus, which flows continually from the tu- nica villofa, and partly by the continual contraction and re- laxation of the mufcular coat.

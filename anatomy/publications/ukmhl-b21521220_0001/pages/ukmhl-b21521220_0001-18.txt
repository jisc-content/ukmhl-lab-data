16 THE BRAIN, Part VI. canal for the paffage of a trunk or branch of this artery ; on which account feveral accidents happen in fractures of the fkull. The external carotid fends another fmall ramus through the corner or fmall end of the fphenoidal or fuperior orbitary fillure, where there is lometimes a little notch on purpofe, as was mentioned in the defcription of the lkeleton. This branch is the anterior artery of the dura mater; and it gives off ramifications in the fame manner as the former, with which it communicates, but its ramifications are not fo numerous. The internal carotid, as it enters the cranium, gives off a fmall branch to the fubftance of the dura mater. The two vertebral arteries enter by the great occipital fo- ramen, and unite in one trunk on the anterior or fphenoidal apophyfis of the os occipitis. Immediately after they pafs through the dura mater on both fides, each of them fends one or two branches to that membrane. Thefe are the po- fierior arteries of the dura mater ; and they communicate by fome ramifications with the middle or fpinal artery above mentioned. Veins and ftnufes. The dura mater contains in its duplica- ture feveral particular canals, into which the venous blood, not only of that membrane, but of the whole brain, is car- ried. Thefe canals are termed finujes; and fome of them are difpofed in pairs, others in uneven numbers; that is, fome of them are placed alone in a middle fituation; others are difpofed laterally on each fide of the brain. The moft ancient anatomifts reckoned only four, to which we can now add feveral others. Thefe finufes are in the duplicature of the dura mater; and their cavities are lined on the infide by particular very fine membranes. They may be enumerated in this manner: The great finus of the falx, or fuperior longitudinal finus, which was reckoned the firft by the antients. Two great lateral

THE BRAIN, 3Â° Part VI, der and fore part a paflage through the infundibulum. It opens backwards into the paflage called iter ad quartum ven- triculum. Infundibulum. Between the bafis of the anterior pillar of the fornix, and the anterior part of the union of the optic thalami, lies a fmall medullary canal, named infundibulum. It runs cown towards the bafis of the cerebrum, gradually con- tracting, and terminates by a fmall membranous and ftraight Ganal, in a foftifh body fltuated in the fella turcica, named glandula pituitaria. Plexus choroides. The plexus choroides is a very fine vaf- cular texture, confifiing of a great number of arterial and venal ramifications, partly collected in two loofe fafciculi, which lie on each lateral ventricle, and partly expanded over the neighbouring parts, and covering in a particular manner the thalami nervorum opticorum, glandula pinealis, tubercu- la quadrigemina, and the other adjacent parts both of the cerebrum and cerebellum, to all which it adheres. In each lateral portion of this plexus, we obferve a venal trunk, the ramifications of which are fpread through the whole extent of the two portions. Near the glandula pinea- lis thefe two trunks approach each other, and, uniting behind that gland, they open into the torcular or fourth finus of the dura mater. When we blow into one of thefe trunks to- wards the plexus, the air pa&es into all its ramifications ; and, in fome fubjeds, thefe two veins form one trunk, which opens into the finus. The ventricular or loofe portions of the plexus often ap- pear to contain a great number of tubercles like glands, which, in the natural ftate, are extremely fmall, but grow bigger in dileafes. To be able to examine them as we ought, the loofe portions muft be made to fwim in clear water, and be there carefully expanded. By the help of a microfcope we then fee

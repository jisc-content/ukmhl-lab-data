Chap. I. 73 AND ITS APPENDAGES. If it be alked, What becomes of this nervous juice, which , * cannot but be feparated in great-abundance, from fo large a quantity of blood palling through the brain very fwiftly, iince we fee very large fecrerions in parts remote from the heart, and through which the blood circulates more flowly, as in the fmall renal and mefenteric arteries ? We anfwer, that it probably exhales through the cutaneous nerves, ihe lalli- tude, both with refpect to fenfe and motion, which may be overcome by fpiritous medicines, fhews that this liquid may be both loft and repaired. Many anatomifts have thought that it alfo exhales into the various cavities of the body, as that of the llomach and inteftines. We may expect fome part of it to be reforbed, that the nobleft humour of the bo- dy may not be too quickly diffipated. That it nourilhes the body is incredible ; for it is too moveable to adhere; and, be- fides, this property of adhering belongs only to flow moving and vilcid humours. What is the defign of fo many protuberances in the brain ? What are the particular ufes of the ventricles, nates, and tef- tes; the diftindtion of the brain from the cerebellum; and the communication betwixt one fide of the brain, cerebel- lum, and fpinal medulla, with their oppofite fides, by fo many tranfverfe bundles of fibres ? Future experience alone can de- termine thefe circumftances, when the brains of feveral ani- mals fhall have been compared with their functions. The ventricles leem to be ulelul in preferving a neceflary diftindtion of the parts, and in leparating them from each o- ther. 1 hat the corpora ftriata or thalami might keep their medullary parts from cohering one to another, it was necefi* fary for a vapour to be poured between them j and the fame is true with regard to the parts of the brain and cerebel- lum. Befides the conjedtures propofed by authors. Dr Mon- ro adds, That the ventricles ferve to increafe the furface of Vol. II. K the

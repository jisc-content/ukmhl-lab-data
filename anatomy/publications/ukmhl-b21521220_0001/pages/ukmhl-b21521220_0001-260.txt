258 lungs. Part VL fend out from all fides a vaft number of fhort capillary tubes of the fame kind. Veficutae bronchi ales. Each of thefe numerous bronchial tubes is widened at the extremity, and thereby formed into a fmall membranous cell, commonly called a veficle. Thefe cells or folliculi are clofely connected together in bundles ; each fmall branch producing a bundle proportional to its ex- tent and the number of its ramifications. Lobhli. Thefe fmall veficular or cellulous bundles are termed lobules ; and, as the great branches are divided into . fmall rami, lo the great lobules are divided into feveral fmall ones. The cells or veficles of each lobule have a free com- munication with each o.her, but the feveral lobules do not communicate fo readily. Interlobular fttbjlatice The lobules appear diftinftly to be parted by another cellulous fubftance, which furrounds each of them in proportion to their extent, and fills up the inter- faces between them. This fubffance forms likewife a kind of irregniar membranous cells, which are thinner, loofer, and broader than the bronchial veficles. This fubffance is difperfed through every part of the lung?, forms cellulous or fpongy vaginae, which furround the rami- fications of the bronchia and blood vefleb, and is afterwards fpread over the outer furface of each lung, where it forms a kind of fine cellular coat, joined to the general covering of that vifeus. When we blow in this interlobular fubftance, the air com- prefies and flattens the lobuli ; and, when We blow into the bronchial veficles, they immediately fwell ; and, if we continue to blow with force, the air pafles infenfibly into the interlobu- lar fubftance. We owe this obfervation to M. Hclvetius. Vafeular texture. All the bronchial cells are lurrounded by a very fine reticular texture of the fmall extremities of arteries and veins, which communicate every way with each other.

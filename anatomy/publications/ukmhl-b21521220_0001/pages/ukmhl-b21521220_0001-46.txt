THE BRAIN*, 44 Part VL We fhall, at prefent, only make fome particular obfervations on the nerves while they remain within the bones, and re- ferve the defcription of their courfe through the whole body to its proper place. Nerves cj the brain. The fir ft pair of nerves that arifc from the brain are the olfa&ory, anciently called procejfus mommillares. Thefe are two very flat and foft medullary ropes, each arifing firft by medullary fibres from the outfide of the lower part of the corpora ftriata, between the anterior and middle lobe, on each fide of the cerebrum, and afterwards by another filament more internally; and laftly, by a third, which is more pofterior and very long. They run under the anterior lobes of the cerebrum, being lodged in two fuperfi- cial grooves in the bafis of thefe lobes, and lying immediately on the dura mater, from the clinoid apophyfis to the os eth- moides. They are firft of all confiderably incurvated from without inward or toward each other, and, having reached near the back-Gde of the os ethmoides, they run for a fcnall fpace pa- rallel to, and at fome diftance from, each other. Backward they are very thin; but their bulk gradually increafes in their courfe forward toward each fide of the crifta galli, where they terminate in elongated papillae, the fubftance of which appears to be fofter and lefs white than that of the nerves, as Dr Soemmering hath beft defCribed in his book, De Baf. Enceph. tt Orig. Nervor. to which the reader is referred. Thefe papillae lie on the two fides of the lamina cribrofa, and fend down a nervous filament through each hole of that lamina. At the fame place, the dura mater fends off the fame number of vaginae, which inveft and accompany the nervous filaments and their ramifications on the internal parts of the nofe. We have already related the origin of the fecond pair, or optic nerves, from the eminences called thalami nervorum op~ ticorum

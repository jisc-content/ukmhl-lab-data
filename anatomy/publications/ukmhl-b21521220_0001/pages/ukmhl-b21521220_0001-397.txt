395 Chap. III. KIDNEYS and URETERS. and partly from the plexus hepaticus and fplenicus. This renal plexus fends likewife lonie filaments round the renal veins. ■ Coats of the kidneys. The kidneys are furroundcd by a very loofe membranous and cellular covering, called memhrana adi- pofi; becaufe, in fat perfons, the cells of this fubftance are filled with fat. This was for a long time improperly taken for a duplicators of the peritonaeum ; the true membranous lamina of which covers only the forefide cf the- kidneys, and confequently they lie without the peritonaeum, becaufe-the portion of that membrane which covers them cannot be con- fidered as an entire coat : So that the only common coat they have is the cellular fubftance, which likewife invefts the renal arteries and veins in form of a vagina. The proper coat or membrane of the kidneys is ftrong and denle, and adheres very clofely to their furfa'ce ; for it pene- trates every where by numerous, elongations into the ir fub- ilanc'e, from which it cannot be feparated without tearing. The external furface of this lamina is very fmooth, polifh- ed, and (hining ; and it renders ihe whole furface of the ’kid, ' ney very even and uniform in adults. In children, this con- vex furface is in a manner divided into federal lobes and ru» \ bercles, aimoft as in oxen and calves.- and in grown pcrilms we fomeiimes obferve the lame inequalities. The bluod-vcffels having entered the kidneys, are ramified, every way ; and chele ramifications fend our other capillar7 .rami, which go all the way to the furface, where they ap- pear like irregular liars,'and furnilh the proper membrane of the kidneys. Sometimes thefetwo ramifications penetrate to the menj'orana adipola, and communicate there with the ar- teriae and venae adipolae. The proper membrane having furrounded the kidnev all the way to the finus, joins the vcfTcls at that place, and ac- companies all their ramifications through the body of tec kiJn.’v,

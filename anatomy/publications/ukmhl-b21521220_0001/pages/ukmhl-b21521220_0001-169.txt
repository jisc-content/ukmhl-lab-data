Afterwards, fepa- rating more and more from the trunk, it pafles under the la- teral part of the tongue, over the lublingual gland ; of which hereafter. It fupplies the neareft parts of the tongue as it pafles; and then entering its lubitance, terminates at the point, having fent a great number of filaments to the papil- lary membrane. It communicates, as ha*, been laid, with tne lingu.dis major, and with the nerve from the eighth pair. This lingual nerve, a little after it leaves the maxilb,ris in- ferior, receives the chorda tympani, which was formerly men- tioned in ddfcribing the ear. This fmall nervous rope has been looked upon by anato- mifts as a kind of fmall recurrent of the nervus linguaiis ; but as, in fome fubjetts, it appears to make limply an acute angle with the lingual nerve, and as this lingual nerve is fomething larger after this angle, it ought rather to be belie- ved to come from the tympanum, and to unite with the lin- gual nerve, than to arile from this nerve, and run up to the tympanum. In fome fubjtiSls, the union of this nerve with the linguaiis is in a manner plexiform, and very difficult to be unfolded. The lingual nerve of the eighth pair, which is its firfi: branch, runs, firfi: of all, on the infide of the digafiric mufcls of the lower jaw, and fupplies the genio-hyoidaei, the neigh- bouring mufcles of the bails of the tongue, and thofe of the pharynx. Afterwards, it fends out the ramifications, and forms the communications defcribtd in the hifiory of the nerves ; and, laftly, goes to the lower part of the tongue, where it communicates with the lingual ramus of the fifth pair, and with the lingual ramus of the ninth. The tongue is the organ of that fenfe called the tnjle; and, by certain experiments, it appears that the power of tafie is exercifed by the tongue chiefly, although it is not confined to ffie tongue alone. For, on whatever part of the mouth, pa- late,

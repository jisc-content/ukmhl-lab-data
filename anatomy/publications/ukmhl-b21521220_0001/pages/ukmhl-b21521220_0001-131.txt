AND ITS APPENDAGES. 129 oblPquely forwarJ, and irregularly concave; the other turned, obliquely backward, and unequally convex ; for all ears which have not been difordered by binding the head too tight in childhood, are naturally bent forward. The forefide is divided into eminences and cavities. The eminences are four in number, called l.vlix, antihelix, tragus, and antitragus. The helix is the large folded border or cir- cumference of the great portion of the ear. The antihelix is the large oblong eminence, furrounded by the helix. The tragus is the fmall anterior protuberance below the anterior extremity of the helix, which, in an advanced age, is cover- ed with hairs. The antitragus is the pofterior tubercle, be- low the inferior extremity of the antihelix. The cavities on the forefide are four in number : The hollow of the helix ; the deprefiion at the luperior extremi- ty of the antihelix, called fojfa navicularis j the concha, or great double cavity that lies under the rifing termed antihelixt ■the upper bottom of which is diflinguifhed from the lower by a continuation of the helix in form of a tranfverle crijta ; and lafily, the meatus of the external ear, fituated at the lower part of the bottom of the concha. The backfide of the external ear fhews only one confider- v \ able eminence, which is a portion of the convex fide of the concha, the other portion being hid by the adhefion of the ear to the os temporis. This adhefion hinders us likewile from feeing the hollow anfwering to the crifta, by which the cavity of the concha is divided. The other parts of the external ear are ligaments, mufcles, integuments, febaceous and ceruminous glands, veflels, and nerves. . • - The cartilage of the outward ear is nearly of the fame ex- tent and figure with the large folid portion already mention- ed ; but it is not of the fame thicknefs, being covered by in- teguments on both fides.

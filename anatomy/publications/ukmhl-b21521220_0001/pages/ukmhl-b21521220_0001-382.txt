3So OMENTUM. Part VI. ceeds better in young lean fubje&s, than in old or fat fub- jeÂ£b. W >en we touch thefe membranes with dry Angers, they flick to them (o cloiely, as hardly to be leparated without be- ing torn, as we lee by the reticular holes which appear in thole portions of membranes that have been thus handled. In that cafe it is to no purpofe to blow through the natural orifice already mentioned j and it is owing to thefe fmall holes that the membranes of the omentum have been fuppo- fed to be naturally reticular. The membranous laminae of the little omentum are conti- nuous, partly with the external membrane of the liver, partly . with that of the (lomach, and a little with the membrane that lines the neighbouring portion of the diaphragm. Thofc of the great omentum are continued partly with the fame coat of the ftomach, and partly with the external covering of the colon, and confequently with the mefocolon ; and they likewile communicate with the covering of the fpleen. We may fatisfy ourfelves concerning thefe continuations, by making a imall hole in one of the laminae of the omentum near the ftomach, colon, &c and by blowing into that hole, through a pipe well fitted to it; for the air will gradually in- finuate itfelf under the common coats of thefe vifeera ; but, if the parts be dry, they mull be moillened a little before the experiment is made. Appendices epiptoicae. The fatty appendices of the colon and return are confidered by Winflow as a kind of fmall o- menta or appendices epiploicac. They are fituated at diffe- rent defiances, along thefe inteftines, being particular elonga- tions of their, common or external coat. They are of the fame ftructure with the great omenta j and there is a cellular fubftance contained in their duplicature, more or lefs filled with fat, according as the fubjeft is fat or lean. Next

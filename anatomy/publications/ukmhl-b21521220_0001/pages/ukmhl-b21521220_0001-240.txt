Part VL BLOOD and JTPCES. 538 gefted into an animal nature. For which laff rcafon an acid is procurable from the blood of graminivorous animals as well as from that of man. The earth, feparaied from the l xivi- um by filtration, makes about an hundred and fiftieth p rt of the original mats, and contains fome particles which arc aftraded by the load ftone. From the preceding analyfis of the blood, it evidently con- tains a variety of particles, diffi ring in bulk, weight, figure, and tenacity ■, fome watery, others inflammable, and molt of them greatly inclined to putrefattion, and of an alkaline na- ture. The blood, in a found healthy ftate, not injured by putrefadbon, or too violent a degree of heat, is neither alka- line nor acid, but mild or gelatinous, and a little faltifh to the tafte ; yet, in iome dileafes it is 'very acrid, and comes near to a ftate of putrefadlion ; as for inftance, in the feur- vy, where it corrodes its containing vcfiels; and in dropfies, the waters of which are frequently alkaline. Bur an alkalef- cent calx is found in the blood of mfedfo, which effervefees with acids. By a microfeope we perceive in the blood red globules; Which, doubtleis, make that parr called cruor or crajffamsntum. If it be qudfioned, whether thefe are not rarhrr lenticular particles ot the fame kind with thofe obferved by Leuwen- lioek in fifii, and lately dil'covered in our own fpecies, wc contefs it is a point difficult to determine: Hewfon, however, obierves that the particles are flat like a guinea.

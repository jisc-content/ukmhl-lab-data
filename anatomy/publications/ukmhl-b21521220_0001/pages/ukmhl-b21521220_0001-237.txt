Chap. II. BLOOD and JUICE& 235 principal part of this coagulated mafs is the ernffamentum or cruor> which has the red colour peculiar to itfclf, and gives ic to the other parts of the blood. This, if it be nor kept fluid by the attrition of a vital circulation, or fome fimilar concuf- lion, runs into a confided compact, but loft mals, like liver, merely by reft and a moderate degree of cold ; as it alio does by the additipri of alcohoJ, by mineral acids, or by a heat of 150 degrees. It is either as a fluid or a folid, frecifically heavier than water by near an eleventh part ; and, when freed from its water, it is inflammable. In a mals of healthy blood, one half or upwards is red cruor; and, in ftrong la- borious people, the lerurn makes only a third part; and is ftill more diminifhed in fevers, often to a fourth or fifth pare of the mals. The white, yellowifh, watery part of the blood, commonly called the ferum, which feparates from this coagulum, tran- fuding, as it were, through its pores, forms a fluid in which the coagulum finks; this again feems, though it really is not fo, a homogeneous liquory it is, in general, one thirty-eighth, part heavier than water, and almoft a twelfth part lighter than the red globular mafs of crafiamentum : 13y'a heat of 150 degrees, or by mixture of mineral acids or alcohol, and by a concufiive motion, it is coagulable into a much harder ihafs than the red cruor, and forms fir ft: an indifloluble glue, then a flefh like membrane, and at length fhrinks up to a horn like fubftance or friable gum. The pleuritic crufts or fkins, polypufes, and artificial membranes, 2re formed from this part of the blood. Eefides this coagulable albumen, tlxe ferum contains a very confiderable portion of Ample water, and fome mucus, lefs capable of being drawn into threads than the red cruor; nor af the fame time coagulable, like the albumen, by heat and acids. Hewfon has difeovered a fecond kind of lymph, which Kraufius has alfo allowed. - â–  By

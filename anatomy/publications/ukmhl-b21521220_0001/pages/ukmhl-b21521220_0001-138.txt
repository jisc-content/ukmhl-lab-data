fore backwards. Toward the labyrinth, this opening has a little border quite round it, which renders it narrower at that place than any where elfe. The feneftra rotunda is fomething lefs than the ovalis, and fituated above it toward the lower and pofterior part of the large tuberofity ; the opening of it, which is the orifice of a particular duel in the labyrinth, lying obliquely backward and outward. The hole in the apex of the pyramid is the orifice of a cavity, which may be named the ftnus of this pyramid. OJJicula auditus. The tympanum contains feveral little bones, called the bones cf the ear. They are generally four in number, denominated from fomething to which they are thought to bear a refemblance, viz. incus, malleus, flapes, and os orbiculare or lenticulare. Incus. The incus, or anvil, refembles, in fome meafure, one of the anterior dentes molares, with its roots at a great diftance from each other. It may be divided into a body, and two branches or legs; one of the legs is long, the other fliort. The body is turned forward, the fliort leg backward, and the long leg downward. The body of the incus is broader than it is thick. It has two eminences, and two cavities between them, much in the fame manner as we fee in the crown of the firft crop of the dentes .molares. The fliort leg is thick at its origin; and from thence de- a creafing gradually, it ends in a point. It is fituated horizon- i tally, its point being turned backward, and joined to the edge j of the mafioid opening of the tympanum. The long leg viewed through the external auditory paf- I fage appears to be fituated vertically; but, if we look upon it either on the fore or back fide, we fee it is inclined, the ex- I tremitv of it being turned much more inward than the root or origin. The point of the extremity is a little flatted, bent inward

Vol. II. 3 E Structure I t Chap. III. GLANDULE RENALES. 401 their natural fituation, they appear like ropes lying behind the peritonaeum, and jutting out more or lels toward the ca- vity of the abdomen, together with that portion of the peri- tonaeum which covers them. All that has been faid about the ftruflure of the ureters, pelvis, arches, flriae, foflulae, and holes at the apex of the papillae, appears moft diftinftly when they are examined in clear water. § 19. Glatidulae Renales, vulgo Capfulae Atrabiliariae. Situation, figure, and fixe of the renal glands, immediately above each kidney lies a glandular body, called by the an- tients capfulae atrabiliariae; by others, capfulae renales, rates fuccenturiati, and glandulae renales ; and they might be pro- perly enough termed glandulae fupra renales. They are fitua- ted on the upper extremity of each kidney a little obliquely, that is, more toward the inner edge and finus" of the kidney, than toward the outer convex edge. Each gland is an oblong body with three fides, three ed- ges, and two points, like an irregular crefcent with its great or convex edge (harp, and the (mall concave edge broad Its length is about two thirds of the greateft breadth of the kid- ney, and the breadth of its middle portion is about one-third of its extent between the two extremities, fometimes more, fometimes lefs. Its colour is a dark yellow. It has one anterior, one polterior, and one lower fide, which laft maybe termed the baits ; and it has one upper, and two lower edges, whereof o^ e is anterior, the other pof- terior. The upper edge may be called the crifia, a d the two lower edgep the labia. One of its extremities i in' r a 1, or turned inward toward the linns of the kidney, the other is external or turned outward t ward the gibbous part of the kidney. The figure of rhts glandular body may 11 k -iv se be compared to that of a cock’s-crmb, or textile top or an helmet.

362 VESICULA FELLIS. Part VI. in a deprefiion on the concave fide of the liver, from the trunk or finus of the vena portae, where the neck is fituated, to the anterior edge of the great lobe, a littdq toward the right fide, where the bottom is placed ; and in fome fubjedls it advances beyond the edge, fo as to oppofe itfelf to the muffles of the abdomen, under the edges of the falfe ribs. Therefore when we hand, the veficula fellis lies in a plane inclined a little from behind forward. When we lie upon the back, it is almort inverted. When we lie on the right fide, the bottom is turned downward, and it is turned upward when we lie on the left fide; and thefe fituations vary accor- ding to the different degrees of each poflure. The gall-bladder is compofed of fcveral coats, the outer- moll of which is a continuation of that which inverts the li- ver, and confequently of the peritonaeum. The under fide of the gall-bladder touches the colon at the beginning of the duodenum, and fometimes at the py- lorus. The fecond coat is find by fome to be flefliy, and made up of two firata, one longitudinal, the other tranfverfe, like that of the ftomach or intefiines ; but, excepting in fome very ro- buft fubjecls, there are fcarcely any mufcular fibres to be feen. A whitilh rtratum is- looked upon as the third coat of the gall-bladder, anfwering to the tunica nervofa of the intertines. The inncrmoll, or fourth coat, has on the infide a great number of reti.cular folds, filled with fmall lacunae, like per- forated papillae, efpecially near the neck of the veficula, where thefe folds are longitudinal, and afterwards form a- kind of finall pylorus, with plaits of the fame nature with thofe in the great one. Thefe lacunae are looked upon to be glands. Sabatier admits only of the firfl: and the lart of thefe coats, aud confiders the intermediate fubftance as being merely cellular and vafcular. That

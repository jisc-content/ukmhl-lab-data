256 Part VI. LUNGS. body. To complete this circle, it only remains for us to find out a courfe for the blood from the right to the left cavities of the heart ; but this firft fuppofes us to be acquainted with the hiftory of the lungs and the pulmonary vefiels. $ 9- Lungs. Situation in general, and figure. The lungs are two large fpongy bodies, of a reddifh colour in children, greyifh in adult fubjedls, and bluifh in old age: They fill the whole cavity of the thorax, one being feated in the right lide, the other in the left, and are parted by the mediailinum and heart. They are of a figure anfvvtring to that of the cavity which contains them ; that is, convex next the ribs, concave next the dia- i phragm, and irregularly flatted and deprefTed next the medi- ailinum and heart. When the lungs are viewed out of the thorax, they reprc- fent, in fome mealure, an ox’s foot, with the forepart turned to the back, the back part to the fternum, and the lower part to the diaphragm. Divifton and figure in particular. They are diflinguifhed into the right and left lung ; and each of thefe into two or three portions called tcbi, of which the right lung has com- monly three, or two and a half, and the left lung two. The right lung is generally larger than the left, anfwerable to that cavity of the breaft, and to the obliquity of the mediaf- tinum. At the lower edge of the left lung, there is an indented notch or finus oppofite to the apex of the heart, which is therefore never covered by that lung, even in the ftrongeft infpirations *, and confequently the apex of the heart and pe- ricardium may always ftrike againfl the ribs ; the lungs not furrounding the heart in the manner commonly taught. This finus is exprefled in Euftachius’s Tables. Stmc-

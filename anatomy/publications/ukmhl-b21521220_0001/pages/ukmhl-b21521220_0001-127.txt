Another ramus of the fu^ perior maxillary nerve goes to the pofterior opening of the nares, being Ipent on the conchae and other internal parts of the nofe. The outer part of the nofe is fupplied by branches from the luperior maxillary nerve, or iiecond branch of the fifth pair, and by others from the portio dura of the feventh pair. in animals which fmell acutely, the parts of the nofe are remarkably large ; but the formation of tne human head in- to a rcundifh figure, has given to the organ of lmelling only a fmall extent of furface ; but, to enlarge this the more, na- ture has made the internal parts of the nofe hollow, and va- rioully complicated in a iurprifing manner. ยง I. Of Smelling. The tatting noxious food might in many inftances be highly dangerous. We can by this fenfe, independent of tatte, difeover the noxious quality of aliments, elpecially luch as are putrid, and confequently peculiarly hurtful to the hu- man frame ; and at the fame time that it directs us to avoid what is dangerous, it enables us to difeern what is grateful and wholefome. This ufe of lmelling in choofing food, is more obfervable in brutes than in men ; yet men left to tliemfeives, and who are undebauched by a variety of feents, pottefs this fagacious faculty in a very eminent degree. The powers and virtues of medicinal plants are hardly to be better known than by the fimple teftimony of tatting and fmelling. Hence it is, that in all animals thefe organs are placed together; and hence the fmelling is fti onger, and the ^rgans larger, in thofe animals which are to feek their prey at

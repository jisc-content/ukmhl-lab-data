Chap. IV. UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. 447 of the liver. They are round ropes of a filamentary texture, fixed by one extremity to the corner of the fundus uteri, a little above and behind the level of that fundus. They were formerly believed to be hollow, and confidered as vafa defe- rentia. Tubae Fallopianae. The Fallopian tubes are two flaccid, conical, and vermiform canals, fituated more or lefs tranf. verfely on each fide -of the uterus, between the fundus and the lateral parts of the pelvis, and included in the anterior duplicatures or pinions of the ligamenta lata. Each of them is fixed by its narrow extremities in the corner of the fundus uteri, into which it opens, though by fo narrow a duff, as hardly to admit a large brittle. From thence their diameter augments by degrees all the way to the other extremity, where it is about one third part of an inch. The body of the tubae goes in a winding courie, and their large extremity is bent toward the ovarig. Thefe large extremities are irregulary round, and termi- nate by a narrow orifice, a little plaited and turned toward the ovarium, where it prelently expands in form of a mem- branous fringe, full of plaits and incifures. Thele fringes arc called the bread ends of the Fallopian tubes. The breadth of the fringe is not equal in all parts. Its circumference is in a manner oval, and the longelt fegment of the fringe reaches to, and is fixed in the ovarium. The folds are difpofed like laminae on the concave fide. Thefe tubes are compofed of fielhy fibres, whereof fome are longitudinal, and fome obliquely circular, with an inter- texture of another very fine fublfance. The anterior pinions of the ligamenrum latum ferve for a common or external coat to both tubes, and alfo to connefl them, in the fame manner as the mefentery connects the in- teflines. From thence the tubes, and elpeciallv their fringes, conic

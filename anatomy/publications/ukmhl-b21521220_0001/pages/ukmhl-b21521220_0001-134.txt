Part VI. ry2 THE EAR, The and concha does not appear on the backfide for, as it is fil- led with cellular fubftance, the fkin pafles ovrfr it. The lobe of the ear, or that foft portion which lies under the tragus, antitragus, and meatus auditorius, is made up of nothing but fkin and cellular fubftance. The meatus audi- torius is partly bony and partly cartilaginous. The bony portion is the longeft, and forms the bottom of the canal, as may be feen in the defcription of the fkeleton. The cartila- ginous portion is the fhorteft; and, in adults, forms the ex- ternal opening or orifice of the canal, as has been already faid. Thefe two portions, joined endwife to each other, form a canal of a confiderable length, of different widenefs in its dif- ferent parts, and a little contorted. It is lined on the infide by the fkin and cellular membrane, through its whole length ; and thus thefe integuments make up for the breaks in the cartilaginous portions, and form a kind of cutaneous tube in the other portion. The cellular membrane is con- founded with the perichondrium and periofteum of the mea- tus. The fkin which covers both fides of the cartilage contains a '’reat number cf fmall glands, which continually difcharge an oily whitilh humour, collected chiefly near the adkefions of the ear to the head, and under the fold of the helix•, and thefe glands are of the ftbaceous kind. The fkin, which lines the meatus auditorius, contains another kind of glands, of a yellowifh colour, and which may be plainly feen on the con- vex fide of the cutaneous tube already mentioned. Thefe glands are difpofed in fuch a manner as to leave re- ticular fpaces between them, and they penetrate a little way into the fubftance of the fkin. They are called glandulae ce- ruminofae> becaufe they difcharge that matter which is named: cerumen or the wax of the ear. They were firft deferibed by' Steno, though fome have named them after Duverney.

Chap. IV. UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. 455 / more raifed on the inner and back part than on the outer and fore part. Its inner or pofterior extremity joins the extremity of the body of the uterus, and furrounds its orifice much in the fame manner as the duodenum furrounds the pylorus, or as the ileum is furrounded by the caecum and colon. ‘ The anterior extremity forms the great orifice, which lies under that of the urethra, and above the foflula of the infe- rior commifture of the alae. The body of the canal is chiefly compofed of a fpongy fub- ftance, interwoven with numerous blood-veflels; and it is commonly longer and narrower in virgins than in married women. Its inner or concave furface has feveral tranfverfe rugae, and is covered by a particular membrane. The rugae are formed by oblong narrow eminences, incurvated like portions of arches, placed very near each other, and difpofed in- fuck a manner as to divide the cavity of the canal into an upper and lower fide. Ey the union of the extremities of the upper and lower rugae, a kind of raphe or future is formed on the right and left fides; and both arches are fometimes interfered ifl the middle, and fo form two half arches ; but in this there is l'oine variety. In general, thefe arches are very confiderable in young perl’ons; become gradually more fuperficial in married wo- men, and are quite loft in time of delivery. The inner or pofterior extremity of this great canal fur- rounds the orifice of the uterus a little obliquely, in fuch a manner as that the upper fide of the canal lies very near the orifice, and the lower fide at a greater diftance from it ; and this makes the extremity of the uterus appear to advance more into the canal on the lower than on the upper part Circulus

3*6 MESENTERIUM, &c. Part VI. The Thefe two portions are in reality only one and the fame continuation of the membranous lamina of the peritonaeum doubled back upon itfclf, and they are diftinguifhed only by their breadth. Taken both together, they form a kfnd of fpiral roll, more or lefs plaited in its circumference. The firft portion has retained the name of mefentery; the other is termed mejocoton. Structure of the mefentery, &c. The mefentery begins at the laft incurvation of the duodenum, and runs obliquely from left to right, along the vertebrae of the loins. In this fpace, the membranous portion of the peritonaeum is detach- ed on both fides, produces a duphcature by two elongations or particular luminue applied to each other, and thus iorrns the mefentery. It is narrdwer at its upper and lower parts, but chiefly at the upper. The middle portion is very broad, and the edge of it next the inteftines is every where very much plaited. Thefe plaits or folds are only waving inflexions, luch as may be oblervcd in the edge of a piece 01 Ihamoy which has been often drawn through the fingers. 1'hey make this edge of the mefentery very long, and they run through about one third of its breadth. . , The two laminae are joined together by a cellular fub- ffance, which contains glands, veflels, and nerves, that fhall be defcribed hereafter; and in fome fubjefts it has a great quantity of fat, which keeps the two laminae at a good dil- tance from each other. Along the whole circumference of the mefentery, the two laminae are naturally feparated, and applied to the two fides of the finall inteftines, which they inveft by their union, or rather reciprocal continuation on the great curvature of that canal, and carry it as in a fcarf or fling. This is what forms the external or membranous coat of the inteftines.

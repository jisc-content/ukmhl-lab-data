Part YE $96 PERITONAEUM, no proof of the glands, which fome anatomifts place there in the natural ftate. The cellular fubftance, or external portion of the perito- naeum, adlieres very clofely to the parts which form the in- fides of the cavity of the abdomen ; and it is not every where of an equal thicknefs. In fome places it is in a very fmall quantity, and fcarcely any appears at the tendinous or aponeurotic portions of the mufculi tranfverfi, and on the lower fide of the diaphragm. In all other places it is thicker, and forms cells expanded into very fine laminae, which, in difeafed fubjects, becomes fometimes fo broad and thick, as to refemble fo many diflindt membranes* In fome places, this fubftance is every way like a membra- na adipofa, being filled with fat, as round the kidneys, and along the flefliy portions of the tranfverfe mufcles, to which it adheres. It entirely furrounds fome parts, as the bladder, ureters, kidneys, fpermatic veflels, See. and it is in thefe places improperly termed the duplicaturt of the peritonaeum. Befides thefe differences in thicknefs, the cellular fubftance has feveral elongations, which have been called productions of the peritonaeum. Two of thefe productions accompany and invert: the fpermatic ropes in males, and the vafcular ropes, commonly called the round ligaments, in women. Two other pals under the ligamentum Fallopii, with the crural veflels, which they involve \ and they are gradually loft: in their courfe downward. To thefe four productions of the cellular fubftance of the peritonaeum, we may add a fifth, which is fpread on the neck of the bladder; and perhaps a fixth, which accompa- nies the inteftinuin reCtum. All thefe elongations pafs out of the cavity of the abdomen, and may be termed external, to diftinguifh them from others that remain in the abdomen, and are called internalof which hereafter. The

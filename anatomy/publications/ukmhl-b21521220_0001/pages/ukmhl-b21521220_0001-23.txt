Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. Si of blood, much like that of the corpus cavernofum of the urethra. Nerves and glands. We obferve fome nervous filaments, which appear to go to the dura mater from the trunk of the fifth pair, at the entry of the cavernous finus; and from the common trunk of the eighth pair and nervus accefforius or fpinalis, as they pafs through the foramen lacerum. Inflam- mation, as well as furgical phenomena, fhew that the dura mater is not void of fenfibility, though, in the found ftate, this is not very obvious. The fmall tubercles, found on the lateral fides of the longitudinal finus of the falx and conti- guous parts of the brain, deferve ftill to be examined before we can determine any thing about them : They have been called glands by Pacchioni, and feem to belong rather to the conglomerate than to the conglobate kind. The whole ^n- fide of the dura mater is moiflened in the .fame manner as the peritonaeum and pleura. The prominent fibres which appear interfering each other in different manners on the infide of the dura mater, efpO- cially near the faix and tranfverfe feptum, and which have been taken for a kind of flefliy fibres, feem to be only liga- mentary and elaflic. The univerfal adhefion of this mem- brane to the craninm, proves that it can have no particular motion, and confequently, that fuch flefliy or mufcular fibres would be altogether ufelefs. This adhefion was plainly de- monftrated by Vefalius, Riolan, &c. long before Roonhuy- fen. ยง 2. Pla Mater. Situation in general. This membrane is a much fofter and. finer fubftance than the former, being exceedingly delicate, tranfparent, and vafcular ; and is connected to the dura ma- ter only by the veins which open into the finufes, as has been already faid.

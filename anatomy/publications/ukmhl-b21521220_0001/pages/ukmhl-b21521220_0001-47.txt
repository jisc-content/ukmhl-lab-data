AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. 4$ ticorum; and we have defcribed their great curvature, and traced them all the way to their re-union, which happens immediately before the fuperior part of the glandula pituita- ria, and confequently before the beak or production of the infundibulum. The internal carotids run upon the outfides of thefe nerves, immediately after their union, and before they pafs through the foramina optica. Befides their origin from the optic thalami, thefe nerves have likewife a kind of communication with the tubercula quadrigemina anteriora, by very fine filaments; one extremity of which is loft in the tubercles, the other in the roots of the great arches or bodies of the optic nerves. They are al- fo connected with the crura cerebri. The internal ftru&ure of thefe nerves feems to change at their entrance into the optic holes, as we fhall fee in another place. The union of thefe nerves, by the fmall curvatures of their cornua, is very difficult to be unfolded in human bodies. This union is commonly found to be very clofe j but, in fome fubje&s, it feems to be no more than a ftrong adhefion ; in others, to be partly made by an interfe&ion or crofting of fibres. They have indeed been found quite feparate ; and in other fubjeCts, one of them has been obferved to be very much altered, both in fize and colour, through its whole paflage, the other remaining in its natural ftate. The third pair, called nervi motor es, oculi communes, oculures communes, and oculo-mufculares, arife from the crura cerebri4 between the corpora albicantia and a fulcus that feparates the crura from the tuber annulare, by numerous threads collected into two bundles, the one a little longer than the other. Thefe foon unite into their refpedtive trunks, which pierce the dura mater behind the lateral parts of the pofterior apo- phylis of the lella turcica, and pafs afterwards along the finus cavernofi, by the fide of the carotid artery, and all the way to

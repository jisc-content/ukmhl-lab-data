The hypogaftric and umbilical regions are more fubjefl: to thefe varieties than the epigaftric. On the fides, between the hypochondria and os ilium, the abdomen is generally a little contracted; and back- ward, about the middle of the regio lumbaris, it is gently depreffed, forming a kind of tranlverfc cavity, anfwenng to the natural incurvation of the lumbar portion of the fpina dorfi. This anterior convexity, and pofterior cavity, change as we £t, ftand, kneel, lie at our full length, or with the thighs bent; and thefe variations depend on the particular fituation of the offa innominata in thefe different poBures. In Banding, the convexity of the belly, and cavity of the loins, are more confiderable than in moB other fituations; for then the lower extremity of the os facrum is turned very far back, and confequently the os pubis very much down. In this fituation of the pelvis, the inteftines fall naturally for. ward, and thus increafe the convexity of the abdomen; and, as the vertebrae of the loins are very much bent at the fame time, the cavity in that place muB likewife be very confider- able.

and its appendages. 171 Â£hap. I, arytenoides, the pofterior and fmalleft ; and the epiglottis, which is above all the reft. Thefe cartilages are connefted together by ligaments, and they have likewife mufcles, glands, membranes, &c. belonging to them. Cartilago thyroidaea, The cartilago thyroidaea is large and broad, and folded in fucli a manner as to have a longitudinal convexity on the forefide, and two lateral portions, which, may be termed alae. The upper part of its anterior middle portion is formed into an angular notch; the upper edge of each ala makes an arch ; and, together with the middle notch, thefe two edges refemble the upper part of an ace of hearts in playing cards. The lower edge of each ala is more even, and the pofterior edges of both are very fmooth, being lengthened out, both above and below, by apophyfes, which we name the cornua of the thyroid cartilage. The fuperior apophyfes are longer than the inferior, and the extremities of all the four are rounded like fmall heads, which in the inferior apophyfes have a (hi- lling furface on the infide, refembling an articular eminence. On the outfide of each ala, near the edge, is a prominent oblique line, which runs from behind forward. The upper extremity of this line is near the fuperior apophyfis or cornu ; and both that and the lower extremity end in a fmall tubero- fity, the lowed: being often the mod confiderable. Thefe tuberofities ferve for the infertion of mufcles and ligaments. The infide of the alae and the convex fide of the anterior portion are very uniform ; and this cartilage ofiifies gradually in old age. Cartilago cricoides. The cricoid cartilage refembles a kind of thick, irregular ring, very broad on one fide, and narrow- on the other ; or it may be compared to a fmall portion of a thick tube, cut horizontally at one end, and very obliquely at the other; and it is diftinguiflied into a bafis and top, into an anterior, pofterior, and two lateral fides. The bafis is almofi: horizontal

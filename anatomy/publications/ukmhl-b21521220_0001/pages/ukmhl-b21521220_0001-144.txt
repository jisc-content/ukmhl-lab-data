THE EAR, 74 a . Part VI* The den fnalls, and almoft all the other common fhells; but, in the left cochlea, the turnings are in a contrary direction. The two half canals communicate fully at the apex of the cochlea. Their feparate openings are towards the balls, one of them being immediately into the lower part of the forc- fide of the veftibulum, the other into the feneflra rotunda. Thefe two openings are feparated by a particular turning, which fhall be afterwards defcribed. The meatus auditorus interm/s, is on the backfide of the pars petrofa, in fome meafure behind the veftibuie and bafis of the cochlea. It is a kind of blind hole, divided into two foffulae, one large, the other fmall. The large one lies loweft, and ferves for the portio mollis of the auditory nerve or feventh pair. The finall one is uppermoft, and is the open- ing of a fmall dutft, through which the portio dura of the fame nerve paffes. The inferior foffula is full of little holes, which, in the natural date, are filled with nervous filaments s of the portio mollis, that go to the veftibuie, to the femicir- cular canals, and to thofe of the cochlea. It is this folTula which forms the fhallow cavity at the bafis of the fpindle of the cochlea. The paffage for the portio dura of the auditory nerve runs behind the tympanum, and its external orifice is termed foramen fylomafoideum. It begins by the fmall foflula, and pierces from within outward the upper part of the pars petrofa, making there an angle or curvature j from thence it is inclined backward behind the fmall pyramid of the tym- panum, and runs down to the foramen ftylomaftoideum, through which it goes out, and is diftributed in the manner to be hereafter defcribed. It communicates likewife by a hole with the finus of the pyramid, and lower down by ano- ther hole with the tympanum. At the upper part of the pars petrofa it is covered with a bony lamina, although forne- times it has been found open above.

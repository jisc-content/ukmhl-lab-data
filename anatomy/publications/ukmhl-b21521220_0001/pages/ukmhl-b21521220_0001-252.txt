2J® Part VL CIRCULATION is lefs than in the arterial trunks, in the fame proportion as the fedtions ot the arteries are Ids than thoie of the veins, i e. twice or aim ft thrice as flow. Another argument of the circulation is the compreflure and relaxation of a vein, where- by the motion of the blood is promoted from one valve to another. The motion of the blood through the veins is u- niform or equable ; but in the arteries, it is alternately greater when the vefiel is more dilated, and lefs when it is contracted. This is proved by ocular infpedtion in living animals. That the motion of the blood is a continued courfe through the fanguincous arteries into the veins, is difcovered from experience. For, firft, it is certain, that all the arteries and veins communicate or open the one into the other; be- caufe, often from one. and that a fmall artery, all the blood of the whole body may be evacuated. We hive numerous examples of fatal hemorrhagics from an inner artery of the nol’e, from the gums, from a finger, from a tooth, from a cu- taneous pore enlarged, from the pundtum lacrymale, from the wound of cupping, and even from the bite of a leech. There are, therefore, of courfe, optn ways, by which the blood fpeedily flows from the venous into the arterial fyftem. That the blood, again, in the arteries, flows from the heart towards the extreme parts of the body, is proved by the mi- crofcope, and by a ligature on the artery of a living animal, and likewife by the fabric, mechanifm, and proportion of the femilunar valves between the arteries and their correfponding ventricles. Whatever artery is flopped by a ligature, the fwelling enfues in that part between the heart and the liga- ture. whilft the other part beyond the ligature, which is more remote from the heart, is emptied. Neither has it there any pulfation, nor, if it be there wounded, will it yield any blood. The fame effedts which we fee fol- low from a ligature, are likewife often produced by dif- eafe ;

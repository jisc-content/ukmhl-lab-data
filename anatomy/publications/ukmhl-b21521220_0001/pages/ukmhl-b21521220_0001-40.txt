THE BRAIN, 3* Part Vh to be taken notice of. We fee, firR of all, four eminences, two named corpora olivaria, and the other two corpora pyrami- dalia. Immediately afterwards, it is divided into two lateral portions by two narrow grooves, one on the upper fide, the other on the lower. They both run into the fubftance of the medulla, as between two cylinders, flatted on that fide by which they are joined together. When we feparate thefe ridges with the fingen, we ob- ferve a crucial intertexture of feveral fmall medullary cords, which go obliquely from the fubflance of one lateral portion into the fubftance of the other. M. Petit, member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and doctor of phyfic, is the author of this difcovery, by which we are enabled to explain feveral phenomena, both in phyfiology and pathology ; of which in another place. The corpora olivaria and pyramidalia are whitifh eminen- ces, fituated longitudinally near each other, on the lower fide of the extremity or cauda, immediately behind the tranf- verfe or annular protuberances. The corpora pyramidalia are in the middle ; fo that the interftice between them, which is only a kind of fuperficial groove, anfwers to the inferior groove of the following portion. The corpora olivaria are two lateral eminences fituated at the outfide of the former, and are thus termed by Willis, Duvtrney, Haller, &c. but Winflow reverfes the names. Thefe four eminences are fituated on the lower half of the medulla; which obfervation we here repeat, to make it be remembered, that, in all the figures and demonftrations, thefe parts are reprefented as fuperior, which, in their natu- ral fituation, are inferior. Thus thefe eminences are under the fourth ventricle, and under the pedqnculi cerebelli. The tubercula mnmmillaria, which are fituated very near the production of the infundibulum, have been taken for glands j probably becaufe of their greyifh inner fybftance, which,

Laftly, on the poflerior edge of the liver, there is a great finus common to both lobes., which gives paflage to the ipina , I dorli and oelophagus, near the place where 'he vena cava de- fccnd> 5 anu wo iomotiu es meet with lciffurts on both tides of the liver, which are not ordinary. Ligamentj c) the liver. The convex fide of the liver is com- monly connrctcu to the diaphragm by three ligaments, winch are only continuations of the membrai ous lamina of the pe- ritonaeum. One lies near the edge of the extremity of each lobe, and one in the middie ; and they an accordingly term- ed the right, middle, and lejt ligaments Tncre is a cellular fiibftance in the duplicature of each, in which the blood vef- fels and lymphatics run and which lends off a kind of lami- na into the fâ€™ubltance of the liver. The right ligament fometimes connc&s the great lobe to the cartilages of the falle ribs; and the left ligament, or that of the fmall lobe, is often double, and advances toward the middle ligament, 'ibis middle ligament begins below in the great lciliure of the liver, near the eminences called fatae and from thence paffes through the anterior notch, and o\er the convex fide of the liver, at the union of the two lobes, and is lixed obliquely in the diaphragm. It is likewife fixed along the upper and inner part of the vagina of the right mufeuius redhis of the abdomen, in luch an oblique manner, as to be nearer the linea alba below than above. Bolides thefe ligaments, the great lobe of the liver is iike- wi!e con riffled to the right ala of the tendinous portion of the diaphragm, not by a ligament, but by a broad and im- mediate adhefton, without the intervention of the membrane of the peritonaeum, which is erdy folded quite round' this adhtfiou^

THE EAR, Part Vt pituitaria. The maftoid opening is oppofite to the fmall opening of the Euftachian tube, but a little higher. 1 he ligaments of the oflicula may be looked upon as con- tinuations of the periofteum. I'he incus is tied by a ftrong fhort ligament, fixed in the point of the Ihort leg to the edge of the maftoid opening. Between the incus and malleus we find a fmall thin cartilage The malleus is connected through the whole length of its handle to the infide of the membrana tympani, in the manner already laid. The malleus has two little mufcles, one anterior, and one internalj and the (tapes has one mufcle. See Innes on the Mufcles. The internal mufcle of the malleus, called tenftr tympani, is very flefiiy and diftindl. It lies along the infide of the Euftachian tube, and is inferted in the neck of the malleus, above the fmall apophyfis, advancing likewife as far as the handle. Vefalius firft obferved, and afterwards Euftachius. more particularly defcribed this mufcle. The anterior mufcle of the malleus, called, from its ufe, laxator tympani, is faid by fome to be flefhy, long, and thin. It runs along the outfide of the Euftachian tube, to which it adheres very clofely through its whole length, and is inferted in the long thin apophyfis of the malleus. It is partly ac- companied by a nerve, which forms what is called the chorda tympani, as we (hall lee hereafter. Haller denies the exiftence of mufcular fibres in this fubftance. Sabatier defcfibcs it, t bur doubts if it be really mufcular. Caecilius Folius is faid to have been the dilcoverer. A third mufcle has by fome been defcribed under the came of external or fuperior mufcle of the malleus; but this is much Ids diltindt than thofe already mentioned. It is laid to arile from the internal fuperior and pofterior part of the meatus externus, and to be fixed by a fmall tendon to the neck of the malleus. Neither Haller nor Sabatier have been able

The internal lamina, called in this place (Imply the pid water, adheres very clofely to the medulla fpinalis, and fends many productions and fepta through its fubftance. If, by a hole made in the pia mater, we inflate the fubftance/ of one lateral portion of the medulla, the air penetrates through the whole of it, and the pia mater, which covers the other lateral portion, is fe- parated from it. The membrana arachnoides adheres more clofely to the pia mater at the lower, than at the upper part, being, as it were, fufpended by the indented ligament which runs along both edges of the medulla, and is fixed, as was mentioned above, by a filament, to the internal lamina of the dura mater in each interftice between the nervous fafciculi. It al(o gives ofF elongations, in the fame manner as the dura mater, to each nervous trunk or rope, as we fhall fee hereafter. ยง 7. The Nerves of the Brain and. Spinal Alarroiu, from their origin to their going out of the Cranium and Spine. The nerves arife either from the brain, medulla oblongata, or fpinalis; and they go out in fafciculi difpofed in pairs* They may be divided into three dalles, viz. nerves which pafs through the cranium, nerves immediately from the fpU nal marrow, and nerves from the brain and fpinal marrow conjointly; to which lafi: clafs the great fympathetic nerve belongs. Ten pairs belong to the brain and medulla oblon- gata, of which nine go out through the foramina of the cra- nium, and the tenth arifes from the extremity of this medul- la as it pafies through the great occipital hole; and la/llj, 29 pairs belong to the medulla fpinalis, of which (even pafs through the lateral notches of the vertebrae cervicis, twelve through thofe of the back, five through thofe of the loins, and five through the anterior holes of the os facrum.

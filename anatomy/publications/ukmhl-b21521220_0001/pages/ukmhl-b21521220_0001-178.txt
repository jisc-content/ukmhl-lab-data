Part VL ij6 THE MOUTH, By the collateral mufcles, is underftood thofe which are inferted by one portion in the larynx, without appearing to contribute any thing to its motions. Of this kind are the thyro-pharyngaei, crico-pharyngaei, &c. The larynx may likewife be moved by mufcles which are not immediately inferted in it, but are wholly in other parts. Such are the mylo-hyoidaei, genio-hyoidaei, ftylo-hyoidaei, omo-hyoidaei, fterno-hyoidaei, and efpecially the digaftrici of the lower jaw, by reafon of their particular adhefion to the os hyoides. It is likewife probable, that thofe mufcles of the pharynx, which are inferted in the balls cranii, may, in cer- tain circumftances, move the larynx in fome fmall degree. The blood-veflels of the larynx, &c. are the arteriae and ve- nae, thyroideae, fuperiores, and inferiores. The nerves are the fuperior and inferior laryngeals, which are branches of the eighth pair. Ufes. The larynx ferves particularly to admit and let out the air in refpiration j and the folidity of the pieces of which it is compofed, hinders not only external objects, but alfo any hard thing which we fwallow, from difordering this palTage. The glottis being a narrow flit, modifies the air which we breathe ; and, as it is very eafily dilated and contracted, it forms the different tones of the voice, chiefly by means of the different mufcles inferted in the cartilagines arytenoidaeae, to which the other mufcles of the larynx, both proper and common, are afiiftants. The whole larynx is likewife of ufe in deglutition, as has been already obferved, by means of its connexion with the os hyoides, to which the digaftric mufcles of the lower jaw adhere; which mufcles raife the larynx, together with the os hyoides, every time we fwallow. The facility of varying and changing the tone of the voice depends on the flexibility of the cartilages of the larynx, and decreafes in proportion as we advance in age ; becaufe thefe cartilages

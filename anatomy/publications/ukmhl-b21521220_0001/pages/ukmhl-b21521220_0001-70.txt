63 THE BRAIN, Part VI. every nerve, as the fir ft origin of all the nerves taken toge- ther make up the cenforium commune. Act the ienlations of the mind reprefented there, or do the voluntary and ne- cefiary motions arile in that place? Thii kerns very proba- ble for it is fcavcely poflible, that the origin of motion can lie below that of the nerve, fince the nerve is fimilar through- out its whole length. The origin of mqtiou cannot be in the arteries, which have neither the faculty of jenfation nor that of voluntary motion. It therefore follows, that the feat of the foul muff be where the nerve tirft begins its formation or origin. We come now to explain the manner in which thq nerves become the organs of lenfe or motion, which, lying hid in the ultimate elementary fabric of the me- dullary fibres, feem to be placed above the reach both of fenfe and reafou. We fhatl neverthelefs endeavour to make this as plain as experiments will enable us. And rirft, it is demonflrated, that the lenlation does.not come through the membranes from the kntient organ to the brain, nor that motion is lent through the coverings from the brain into the mufcle; for the brain ltfcif lies deeper than thefe mem- branes, and receives the imprtfiions of lenfe, and, when hurt, throws the mufcles into convulfions. Moreover it is certain, that the nerves arife from the medulla of the brain *, for by ocular infpection we lee that to be the cafe in all the nerves of the brain, more efpecially in the olfadtory, optic, fourth, and feventh pair of nerves, which continue their medullary fabric a long way before they put on the covering of the pia inater. We muff therefore next inquire what this medulla is. It is a very foft fubftance ; its compofition is fibrous, as appears from innumerable arguments : Its fibres are vifible in the cor- pus callofum, in the firiatum, in the thalami of the optic nerves, and fpinal marrow ; and ftill more evidently in the brains

10 OF THE HEAD. Part VI. fions on the head; the firft is the tendon of the occipito- frontalis mufcle, the fecond is the pericranium, which covers • the external furface of all the bones of the cranium. The external part of this membrane may be laid to fepa- rate from the other at the femicircular plane upon the fide of the cranium, mentioned in the delcription of the bones, and becomes a very ftrong aponeurofis, which covers the temporal mufcle', and is afterwards fixed to the external pro. cefs of the os frontis, and to the upper edge ot all the zygo- ma. The reft of the pericranium is connected to the other parts of the head. The head is generally confidered as one of the three prin- cipal cavities of the human body. On its outfide are fituat- ed the feats and bafes of feveral very complex particular or- gans ; whereas on the infide it contains only one, namely the brain, which is indeed the primum mobile of the whole animal oeconomy. The rnechanifm of this organ is very little known ; and the ftrufture of its different parts, even of thofe with which we are fuppofed to be moft acquainted, is very difficult to be demonftrated. Sect. I. Of the Brain and its Appendages. Ti-ie name of brain is given to all that mafs which fills the cavity of the cranium, and which is ■ immediately fur- rounded by two membranes, called meninges by the Greeks, and matres by other antients, becaufe they were commonly of opinion, that thefe membranes were the origin,, and, as it were, the mother of all the other membranes of the body. This general mafs is divided into three particular portions; the cerebrum or brain properly fo called, the cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. To thefe three parts contained within the cranium, a fourth is added, which fills the great canal of the

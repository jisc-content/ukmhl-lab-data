32 THE BRAIKf, Part VI. quadrigemina. We fhall ufe the names, however, as we find them. Dire&ly under the place where the tubercles of one fide are united to thole of the other fide, lies the iter ad quartum vetitriculltm, which communicates, by its anterior opening, ■with the third ventricle, under the thalarr.i nervorum opti- corum, and, by its pofterior opening, with the fourth ventri- cle, which belongs to the cerebellum. Foramen commune pojlenus. Where the convex parts of the two anterior tubercles join thele polfermr convex parts of the thalami nervorum opticorum, an interlace or opening is left between thefe four convexities ; but it does not com- municate with the third ventricle, for the bottom of it is fhut up by the pia mater. The name of anus is applied to it. Glandula pinealis. The glandula pinealis is a fmall foft greyifh body, about the fize of an ordinary pea, irregularly round, and fometimes of the figure of a pine apple, fituated behind the thalami nervorum opticorum above the tubercula quadrigemina. It is fixed like a l'mall button to the lower part of the thalami, by two very white medullary pedunculi, which, at the gland, are very near each other, but feparate almoft tranfverfely toward the thalami. It feems to be moftly of a cortical fubftance, except near the footfhilks, where it is fomewhat medullary. The foot- flalks are fometimes double, as if they belonged to the two anterior tubercles. This body adheres very clofe to the plexus choroides, by which it is covered, as we fhall fee here- after ; and it therefore requires fome dexterity to ieparate it from the glandula. without altering its fituation, or breaking the pedunculi. Th.s glaDd has been often found to contain gravel. Eelow the glandula pinealis tlure is a medullary tranfverfe cord, called the pojlaior cdtnmijfure of the hennjphercs tf the cerebrum. § 4-

4 5* UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. Part VI. the great canal of the uterus. The circumference of this orifice is bordered, either by a membranous circle, called hy- men, or by flefhy portions, termed earunculat myrtiformes. On each fide of the clitoris begins a very prominent fold, like a crifta, which runs down obliquely on each fide of the orifice of the urethra. Thcfe folds are termed nymphae, and they might likewile be named crijla clytoridis. On each fide of the great orifice lies the lmall proftatic hole already de- fcrihed. Clitoris. The clitoris appears at firft fight like a fmall im- perforated glans. Its upper and lateral'fides are covered by a kind of praeputium, formed bv a particular fold of a por- tio1 of the inner fide of the alae, which appears to be glan- dular, and to dilcharge a certain moifture, and its infide is granulated. Bv difieftion, we difcover in the clitoris a trunk and two branches, as in the penis, confifting of a fpongy fubflance, and ot very elaftic coats, bur without any urethra, ibis fubflance may be inflated either by air or anatomical injec- tions into the artery, &c. The trunk is divided into two la- teral parts by a middle feptum, from the bifurcation to the glans, where it i> infenfibly loft. The bifurcation of the trunk is on the edge of the carti- laginous arch of the ofia pubis ; and the branches, which refemble the roots of the corpora cavernofa, are inferted in the inferior rami of thcfe bones, and in thole of the ofia if- chium, where they terminate by degrees ; but there is home- times a membranous tube on each fide, which reaches to the tuberofity of the ifchium. The trunk of the clitoris is fuftained by a ligamentum furpenforium fixed in the fymphyfis of the ofla pubis, and containing this trunk in its duplicature, nearly as in the other fex.^ \ \ Four

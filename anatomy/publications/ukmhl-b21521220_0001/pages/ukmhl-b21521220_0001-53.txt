5* Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. the breaks, or difcontinuations, between the cords which run in the vagina of the dura mater. The pia mater adheres very clofely both to the fafciculi and filaments of which they are compofed. Among the original productions of the nerves of the me- dulla fpinalis, we ought ftill to reckon the formation of the nervi acceflorii of the eighth pair. They arife from the la- teral parts of this medulla by feveral filaments, about the third or fourth vertebrae of the neck, and fometimes lower. They run up on each fide between the anterior and poiterior ranks of the nervous fafciculi, gradually increafing in fize by the acctffion of new filaments from the pofferior fafciculi. Having reached above the firft vert-ebra of the neck, they have a kind of adlufion or communication with the neigh- bouring ganglions of the nervi fub-occipitales, or thofe of the tenth pair. Above this adhefion they receive two filaments each, from the back fide of the medullaj and afterwards con- tinue their courfe towards the great occipital foramen. As they enter the cranium, they communicate with the nerves cf the ninth and tenth pairs} and alterwards they join thofe of the eighth pair, with which they return out of the cranium. ยง S. Elocd V?J)cls of the Braiti and Medulla Spinalis. Arteries. The arteries which fupply the cerebrum, cerebel- lum, and medulla oblongata, come partly from the carotids which enter the cranium through the canals in the apophy- fes petrof'ae of the ofla temporum, and partly from the ver- tebrales which enter by the great occipital foramen, and fend off the arteriae fpinales into the canal of the fpine for the medulla lodged there. All thefe arteries are divided into feveral branches, which fend out a great number of ramifications diflributed through both fubftances of the brain, and through the whole extent of

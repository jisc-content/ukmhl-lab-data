A large quantity of this faliva is feparated by numberlefs fmall glands of the lips and cheeks ; and the juice poured out from the exhaling vefTels of the tongue, mouth, and cheeks, is of the like kind, or rather more watery. As for the duc- tus incifivus, we are now fufficiently certain, that, in the ge- nerality of perfons, it difcharges nothing into the mouth, and only gives paffiige to vefl'els and nerves running between the palate and nollrils. The faliva is a watery liquor, with a moderate quantity of fait, partly lixivial, and partly culinary ; with fome oil and earth, diffipable by fire, with fcarce any tafte, unlefs what is given to it by difeafe or famine. The quantity produced is very confiderable, as twelve ounces have been known to flow out from wounds in thole parts in the fpace of an hour. It is for the molt part fwallowed, and indeed it cannot be thrown away without hurting the digellion. By the motion of the jaw in mafiication, the falival glands, which have been already defcribed, are comprefled, fo as to difcharge their juices into the mouth in great plenty. When the mouth is opened, the maxillary gland, being prefied by the digaftric and mylo-hyoidaeus, throws forth abundance of faliva; the mafieter, when fwelled, prefies the parotid gland, as does alfo the cutaneous mufcle of the neck which lies over it : And it is this mufcular preffure that excites the appetite, and pours the faliva into the mouth. The food being ground between the teeth, and intermixed with the watery faliva and air, is broken down into a foft, juicy pulp, replete with elaftic air; the food afterwards un- dergoes a farther diffolution from the warmth of the parts caufing the air to expand, and, by its elafticity, burft afunder the * This earth is neither acid nor alkaline, although from thence may be obtained a very fmall portion of lixivial fait.

PENIS. Chap. IV. 435 capillary ramifications, which accompany all the convolutions and folds of the fmall canals. The other fafcicufus is poficrior, and is ditlributed to the epidydimis in the fame ma: ner. The fpermatic artery is accompanied by a ramus of the epigaftric artery, which runs down on the tide of it as far as the tefiicle. where they communicate reciprocally with each other. There is fometimes a fmall ramus of the hypogaltric artery, wfjich accompanies the vas deferens to the epidydi- mis, and there communicates with the arteria fpermatica. The tefiicle has likewife numerous lymphatic vefieis, which run in the fpermatic cord, and join the lymphatics of die pelvis and loins. Nerves. The nerves of 'h-fe organs come from the lumba- res and fieri ; and they communicate with the fyrhpatheticus maximus, and plexus mefenterici. Near the arch of the os pubis, they form together, on each fide, a particular rope, which pafTes under that arch along the upper tide of the neighbouring corpus cavernolum, near the artery already mentioned. In their pafilige over the corpora cavernofa, they fend oft' a great many rami, which furround thefe bodies on all fides, between the fki.o and the ligamentary integument ; being fo difpofed, as that the arteries lie between them and the middle vein. They muft be examined foon after the fkin has been raifed, becaufe, when the ramifications are dried by the air, they difappear. The nerves of the tefticles are very fmall. They are form- ed by the renal and mefenteric plexus. The nffrves of the loins fend fmall branches likewife'along with thefe. They run along the fpermatic cord ; but it is exceedingly difficult to trace them into the tefiicle. There is likewife one nerve on each fide; which beincr O produced from the union of the fecond, third, and fourth pairs.

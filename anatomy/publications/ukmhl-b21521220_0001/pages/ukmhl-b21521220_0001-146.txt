Part VI. 144 THE EAR, The two upper parts or quarters are bony; and of thefe the innermoft is formed by the fide of the apophyfis petrofa, the outermoft by the fide of the apophyfis fpinalis of the os fphenoides. Of the two inferior parts, the internal, or that next the os fphenoides, is cartilaginous; and the external, or that next the pars petrofa, membranous. The Euftachian tube, thus formed, is very narrow next the ear, but grows gradually wider, efpecially near the pofterior nares, where the inner cartilaginous fide terminates by a pro- minent edge, and the outer fide joins that of the neighbour- ing noftril. The cavity of the tube is lined by a membrane like that of the internal nares, of which it appears to be a continuation ; and on the prominent edge, this membrane is confiderably increafed in thicknefs, reprefenting a kind of half pad. The fituation of the two tubes is oblique, their pofterior extremities at the ears being at a greater diftance than the anterior at the nares ; and the convex tides of the prominent edges are turned toward each other. The openings of the tubes are oval at this place, as is likewife their whole cavity, efpecially that of the mixed portion. The membrana tympani is a thin, tranfparent, fiattifh pel- licle, the edge of which is round, and ftrongly fixed in the orbicular groove which divides the bony meatus of the ex- ternal ear from the tympanum or barrel. This membrane is very much ftretched or very tenfe, and yet not perfectly flat: For on the fide next the meatus externus it has a fmall hol- lownefs, which is pointed on the middle ; and on the fide next the tympanum it is gently convex, and alfo pointed in the middle. This membrane is fituated obliquely, the upper part of its circumference being turned outward, and the lower part in- ward, fuitably to the direftion of the bony groove already mentioned. It confifts of feveral very fine laminae, clof'ely united

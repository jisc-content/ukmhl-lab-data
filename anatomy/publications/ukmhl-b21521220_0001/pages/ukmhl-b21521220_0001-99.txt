We difcover upon it a great number of fine hairs, covered by an oily yellowifh matter, furnifhed by this gland ; and, on the globe of the eye, near this glandular body, we fee a femilunar fold formed by the conjundliva, the concave fide of which is turned to the uvea, and the convex fide to the nofe. This fold, which has the name of membrana Jemilunaris, appears raoft when the eye is turned toward the nofe ; it is fhaped like a crefcent, the two points of which anfwer to the pundta lacrymalia, and condudl the tears into the pundla. ยง 8. The Mufcles of the Palpebrae. The mufcles of the palpebrae are commonly reckoned to be two ; one peculiar to the upper eye-lid, named levator palpebrae fuperioris; the other common to both, called muf- cuius orbicularis palpebrarum, which has been fubdivided by different authors in different manners. See Delcription of Mufcles, Vol. I. The fkin of the fuperior palpebra is folded arch-wife, al- moft in a parallel direction to that of the femioval fibres j. the plicae interfering the levator, whereas the other folds only interfeft the orbicularis. The radiated and oblique plicae feldom appear in young perfons, except when the firft and fecond portions of the orbicularis are in aflion; but in. aged perfons its marks are vifible at all times. In man, the fuperior palpebra has much more motion than the inferior. The fmall fimple motions, called twinklings which frequently happen, though not equally often in all fub- jecls, are performed by the alternate contraction of the leva- tor palpebrae and orbicularis. Thefe flight motions, efpecially thofe of the upper palpe- bra, are not very eafy to be explained according to the true fhutture of the part. The motions which wrinkle the N palpebrae.

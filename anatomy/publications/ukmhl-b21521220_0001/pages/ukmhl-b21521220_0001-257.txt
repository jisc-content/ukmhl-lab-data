OF THE BLOOD. Chap. It. 2 55 fmaller into the larger arteries ; and, on the other fide, where an obfirudhon has been formed above the valves, the blood has been known to Aide bach fr> m the venous trunks into their fmalier branches. Bur then thefe accidents are very momentaneous or hidden, and the blood foon returns into its natural courle. Thefe things happen moll: frequently in the abdomen and vena portarum. The rourfe of the humours in the lymphatic veins which have valves, appears both from the nature of thofe veins, and from Jigatures: For every lymphatic vein, when tied, fwells between its (mailer extremities and the thoracic dudl; but grows flaccid between the duff and the ligature. All the valves in thefe, like thofe of the blood veins, give a free pafi- fage for flatus and mercury to flow to the thoracic dudt: But they make a refiftance, and often an obifinate one, to any return the other way ; although fomctiuies they have been known to yield. Ihe vapours that moiflen the whole cellular fubftance, the fleams of the abdomen and other cavities, are all abforUed by the leaf! pellucid veins, and fo conveyed to the blood veins, that their contained juices may pafs on to the heart : And from thence it is that otdema enlues, when a vein is comprtfled by a ligature; becauie, by intercepting the courfe of the abi« rbing veins by the ligature, the vapour* being un« abforbed, itagnate. In tine other imaller veliels we can make no experiments ; but they appear conformable to what we h ve laid of the iarger veflels, both from rtafon and ana- logy. Th is dodlrine is likewiie iupported by the experiments? of water, or other liquors, ablor'iecl out of. the cavity of the intefl nes, thorax, and pulmonary vcficles. Ali the juices, therefore, in the human body, are driven out of the heart into the aorta ; from whence they are all te- turned again to the heart by the veins; thofe humours •nly excepted which are exhaled or difeharged out of the body.

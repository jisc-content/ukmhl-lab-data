Part V?, THE BRAIN, it is, that in active quadrupeds, where a concufiion is more likely to happen, the brain and cerebellum are divided by a bony partition. With rcfpedt to the glands of Pacchioni placed near the falx, their ufe is not yet fufilciently known. The vapour, which exhales from the furface of the pia mater, is not fepa- rated by thefe glands, for it is every where exhaled, even in- to the ventricles, where there are no glands; but it plenti- fully tranfpires every where from the mouths of the leaf! ar- teries; as we fee by experience, when water or glue are in- jected, which fweat out through every point in the furface of the pia mater. The next covering of the brain is the araehnoides, which furrounds the whole furface of the brain, as the former does the internal cavity of the cranium. This very thin or tender member, being pellucid like water, every way furrounds the brain, whofe inequalities it climbs over; and although it be fo extremely thin, yet it is tolerably ftrong, and furrounds the larger veflels, fo as to make them feem to run between the pia mater and araehnoides. The third or innermoft covering of the brain, which :s foft and cellular, is properly tht pia mater. This immediate- ly invefts the whole furface of the brain and fpinal marrow- on all Tides, is tender, and confifts of a vaft number of fmall vefTels which are joined together by cellular matter, and con- veyed into the fubltance of the brain.- The veins of the brain are not dilpofed in the fame man- ner with thofe in other parts of the body. For they have no valves, nor do they run together in company with the ar- teries, nor have their trunks the ftruClure which is common- ly oblerved in the other veins. The veins from the different parts of the brain run into Cnufes already deferibed. The great quantity of blood which goes to the brain, the greater impulfe with which it is fern into the carotid arteries, the

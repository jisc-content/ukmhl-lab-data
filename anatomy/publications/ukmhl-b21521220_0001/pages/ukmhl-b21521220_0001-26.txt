Near the furface of the cerebrum, thefe circumvolutions are at fome diftance from each other, representing Serpentine ridges and, in the interfaces between them, the Superficial veins of the cerebrum are lodged, between the two laminae of the pia mater, from whence they pals into the duplicature of the dura mater, and fo open into the finufes. Thefe circumvolutions are fixed through their whole depth to the fepta or duplicatures of the pia mater, by an infinite number of very fine vafcylar filaments, as may be leen by pulling the circumvolutions a little afunder with the fingers. When we cut tranfverfely, we obferve that the fubflantia alba lies not only in the inner part of the brain in general, but alfo within each circumvolution, fo that there is the fame number of internal medullary circumvolutions as of external cortical ones; the firft reprefenting white laminae inverted by others of an afh colour ; but the cortical fubftance is in many places thicker than the medullary. Suljlatice. The fubftance of the cerebrum is of two kinds, diftinguifhed by two different colours; one part of it being of a greyifh or afh colour; the other, which is Somewhat firmer than the former, is remarkably white, but redder in the foetus. The afh-coloured fubftance lies chiefly on the outer part of the cerebrum like a kind of cortex, from whence it has been named fubjlantia corticalis, or cinerea. The white iubftance occupies the inner part, and is named fubjlantia me- du/laris, or Amply fubjlantia alba. This abounds in greater quantity than the other, and in many places is perforated with red arteries.

RESPIRATION*. Part VI. 2 OB pleura is found a watery or rather ferous vapour, of a coagu- lable nature, like that of the pericardium â€¢, which vapour tranfudes from the iurface of the lungs continually in the foetus, and not unfrequently in the adult. This is fometimes increafed lo as to form a droply, or thickens into a kind of febaccous matter; or, laftly, concreting into fibres, joins the lungs to the pleura. The veficles of the lungs do not receive the air by a fingle orifice from the trachea, as a vial; but the air, exhaling from the leaf! branches of the trachea, is admitted in fitch a manner into their irregular fpaces, that it freely fpreads through them from any one part of the lungs into a'l the reft, and returns again in like manner. This is demon- ftrated by inflation, which drives the air even through the leaft branches of the trachea into the fmalleft lobes ; from whence it readily paftes into all the reft. Nor, in man and finaller animals, fays Haller, is the cellular fabric of the in- tervals fhut up trom the veficles of the lungs ; but accor- ding to Sabatier and other late writers, there is no communi- cation between the common cellular fubftance and the cells of the lungs. The air is driven into thefe veficles through the trachea, which ariles from the larynx ; and in the upper part of the thorax is received between the laminae of the pofterior part of the mediaftioum. Its laft branches are invifible, which exhale the air into the cellular fpaces of adult lungs, and likewife receive the watery vapours exhaling from the arteries into thefe fpaces from whence they are thrown by exfpiration. The quanti'y of blood which enters into the lungs is ex- ceedingly great, equal to (or even perhaps greater than) that which is fent in the fame time throughout the reft of the body ; which, therefore, demonftrates fbme very confiderable life proper to this vifcus. And that air is concerned in the ufe

Part VI. THE BRAIN, 18 The cavity of this finus is not cylindrical, but triangular, having three fides ; one fuperior, parallel to the cranium; and two lateral, inclined to the plane of ‘the faix. The up- per fide is formed by the external furface of the dura ni3ter; and, through the middle of its breadth, a kind of fine raphe or future runs from one end to the other. « The two lower or lateral fides 3re productions of the inner furface of the dura mater; which having parted from the external, are inclined towards each other, and then unite; forming firfl the finus, and afterwards the duplicature of the falx. This finus is lined interiorly by a fine proper mem- brane, which forms likewife a kind of raphe or fut' re along the bottom of the finus, that is, along the union of the two lateral fides. In this finus we obferve feveral openings and ligamentary fraena. The openings are orifices of veins ; the fmalleft of which belong to the dura mater, the largelt to the brain. The veins of the brain enter the finus, for the mod part, obliquely from behind forward, after they have run about a finger’s breadth in the duplicature of the dura mater. It has been thought, that the arteries of the dura mater difcharged themfelves immediately into the finufes ; becaufe injeClions made by the arteries, or a hog’s briftle thrull into them/have been found to pafs into thefe finufes; But, on a more elefe examination, it has been difeovered, that the in- jections palled from the arteries into the veins, 2nd from thence into the finufes, through the fmall orifices already mentioned ; and that the hog’s briftle pierced the fides of the artery, which are very thin near the finufes. This mlftake gave rife to another, namely, that the dura mater had no veins; and what confirmed it was, that the arteries of the dura mater cover the veins fo entirely, that the edges of the veins are hardly perceivable on either fide of the arteries. There arc, however, fome places where tl;e yeins

THE NOSE, Part VI. xi6 at a conGderable diftance, or to reject malignant plants from among thofe that are fit for food. The fenfe of fmelling is performed by means of a foft pul- py membrane, full of pores and fmall vefiels, which lines the whole internal cavity of the noftrils ; it is thicker upon the feptum and principal convolutions, but thinner in the finufes. Within this membrane are difiributed vefiels and nerves which have been already deferibed. The nerves of the nofe, being almoft naked, require a de- fence from the air, which is continually drawn through the noftrils, and blown out again by refpiration. Nature has therefore fupplied this part, which is the organ of fmelling, with a thick infipid mucus, very fluid in its firft reparation, but, by the air, condenfing into a thick, dry, and more con- fiftent cruft. By this mucus the nerves are defended from drying and from pain. It is poured out from many fmall arteries, and depofited partly into numerous cylindrical dudts, and partly into round vifible cryptae or cells, fcattered all over the noftrils. It flows out all over the furface of the olfactory membrane, which is anointed with it on all fides. This mu- cus is accumulated in the night time ; but, in the day, it either flows fpontaneoufly, or may be more powerfully expel- led by blowing the nofe. By becoming dry and harlh, it ir- ritates the very fenfible nerves of the membrane, whence a fneezing is excited for its removal. The finufes of this part, which abound with mucus, are evacuated in the manner al- ready deferibed in page 121. The tears defeend, by a chan- nel proper to themfelves, into the cavity of the nofe, by which they moiften and dilute the mucus. The cartilages render the nofe moveable by its proper muf- cles, fo as to be raifed and dilated by a mufcle common to the upper lip, and to be contracted together into a narrow compafs by the proper depreflor and compreflor mufcle pul- ling down the feptum. Thus the prominent organ of fmel-

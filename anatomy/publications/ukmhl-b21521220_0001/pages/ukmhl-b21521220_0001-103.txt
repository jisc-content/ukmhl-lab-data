The third branch, is long, and goes to the obliquus inferior, contributing like- wife to the formation of the lenticular ganglion already men- tioned. The fourth branch is large, and fupplies the adduc- tor oculi. The firft branch of the fifth pair, commonly termed mr- vus ophthalmicus, divides into three rami, as it enters the orbit, and fometimes only in two, one of which is afterwards fub- divided. Of thefe three branches one is fuperior, and term- ed tierviis fuperciliaris ; one internal, termed nafalis ; and one external, to which the name of temporalis or lacrymalis is ap- plied. The fuperior or fuperciliary ramus runs along the whole periofteum of the orbit; and having paffed through the fuperciliary notch or foramen of the os frontis, is difiributed to the mufculus frontalis, fuperciliaris, and fuperior portion of the orbicularis palpebrarum ; and it communicates with a fmall branch of the portio dura of the feventh pair. The internal or nafal branch paffes under the ramification of the nerve of the third pair; and running toward the nofe, is difiributed partly on it, and partly on the neighbouring parts of the orbicularis, the caruncula, &,c. This branch fends off a filament, which, palling through the internal an- terior orbitary hole, enters the cranium, and prefently returns through one of the ethmoidal holes to the internal parts of the nofe. Sometimes this nafal ramus communicates with the ramus fuperciliaris by a particular arch, before it enters the orbitary hole. The external or temporal ramus, which is fometimes a fubdivifion of the fuperciliaris, is difiributed to the glandula lacrymalis, and fends off a filament which pierces the orbi- tary apophyfis of the os malae. The fecond branch of the fifth pair, called tiervus maxilla- ris fuperior, fends off a ramus through the bony canal of the lower

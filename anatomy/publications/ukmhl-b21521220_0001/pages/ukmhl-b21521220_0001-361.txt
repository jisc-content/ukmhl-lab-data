When we cut the liver in dices, it is eafy to diftinguifh in each dice the ramifications of the vena hepatica from thofe of the vena portae; the fird being thinned and larged, and adhering doled to the fubdance of the liver ; whereas thofe of the vena portae, which are inveded by the cellular cipfu- la appear to be a little ruffled when empty ; becaufe the cel- lular capfula fubfides when if is cut but the other veins re- main uniformly open, their ddes adhering to the fubdance of the liver ; befides, thev are accompanied by the branches of the hepatic artery and b'liary duds which do not follow thofe of the vena hepatica : And Sabatier oblerves, that the direc- tion of the branches of the vena hepatica is perpendicular to that of the vena portae. Hepatic artery and nerves. The liver receives from the ar- teria cadiaca a particular branch, termed arter'ui hepatica; which being very fmall when compared with the bulk of that vifeus, feem defigned only for its nourn'hment, and not for the fecretion of the bile The plexus hepaticus, formed by the nervi fympathetici maxi ni et medii, furnifhes a great number of nerves to the fubdance of the liver. The rami- fications of the artery and nervous plexus are incl >ded in the cellular capfula, together with thofe of the vena portae and pori bilarii. The pulfation of this artery has been by fome anafomids taken for that of the capfula, which they fuppofed to be muf. cular ; and by this they h ive endeavoured to explain the ar- terial fundion of the vena portae : But they have not confi- dered that the blood in this vein does not require to be pumped forward ; becaufe fo fwifr a motion would have been prejudicial to the fecretion of the fine oil of the bile, for which a flow and almoft inlenfible motion is nec.efT ry.

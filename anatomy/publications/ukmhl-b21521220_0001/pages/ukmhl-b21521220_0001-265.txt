>263 Chap. II. LUNGS. v glands fomething larger than rhe former, which lie on the outer or pofiÂ°rior furface of that flrong membrane by which the circumference of the canal is completed. The fame flru<fh.re is ohfervable in the ramifications of the trachea from the great'-ft to the fmallefl. All the veflels of which the lungs are chiefly cnmpofed, that is, the air veflels, or bronchia, and the blood veflels, or the pulmonary and bronchial arteries and veins, accompany each other through this whole vifcus. They are commonly difpofed in fuch a manner, even to the laft ramifications, as that a fuhordinate trunk or branch of the bronchia lies between the like trunks or branches of the pulmonary artery and vein ; the bronchial veflels being immediately joined to the bronchia. In fome place- thefe three kind of veflels touch each other in fuch a manner as to leave a triangular fpace in the middle The bronchia are divided into a very great number of ra- mifications ; and the lafl rami are the pedicles or footflalks of the fmall lobuli. All the lobuli are angular, oblong, broad, thin, &c. The footflalks fend out other fmaller mem- branous pedicles, which are very fhort, and terminate in the bronchial veficles or cells, of which they are continuations. The fuhordinate trunks and rami detach a great number of thefe pedicles from their convex furface. When we blow into the lungs, the bronchial cells, neireft their outer furface, appear like fmall portions of round vefi- cles-; and from this appearance all the bronchial cells have got the name of veficles, though they are all angular, except thole which 1 have now mentioned. When we examine a lung without blowing it up, we find that the cartilaginous ferments of the bronchia lie fo near as to be enga ed in each other; and in drawing out any por- tion of the bronchia by the two ends, thefe fegmenrs are parted, and the whole canal is incrcafed in length; but it contrails

The Chap. III. INrESTINUM DUODENUM. 3»t artery and vein, afcending infenfibly from right to left, till it gets before the aorta, and laft vertebrae ot the back. It con- tinues its courfe obliquely forward by a gentle turn, which' may be reckoned a third incurvation, and alfo the extremity of the duodenum. Through this whole courfe the duodenum is firmly bound down by the folds of the peritonaeum, elpecially by a tranf- verfe duplicature which gives origin to the melocolon. The two lamina of this duplicature being at firft feparate, and foon afterward uniting, muft leave a triangular fpace between them, which is lined with a cellular fubftance. It is in this fpace that the duodenum adheres, by means of the cellular fubftance, to the parts already named ; and the inteftme is contained therein, as in a cafe ; fo that, without difie£tion, we can fee nothing but its two extremities ; and even thefe are hid by the colon, and by {he firft convolutions of the jejunum. Structure of the duodenum. The firft coat of the duodenum is confequently different from that of the other fmall intef- tines, having this peculiar to it, that it does not inveft the whole circumference of the inteftine ; becaufe, through the greateft part of the length, it lies in the triangular fpace al- ready mentioned; and, for the lame reafon, there is a greater quantity of cellular fubftance b longs to the outer coat of the duodenum than to that of the other inteftines. The mufcular coat of the duodenum is thicker than in the jejunum and ileum. The tunica nervofa ancl villofa form conjointly, on the in- fides of this inteftine, a great number of fmall duplicatures, which advance into the cavity more or lefs dire&ly, like por- tions of circular planes, with one edge fixed to the imeftine, and the other loofe. Ihefe are what anatomifts call valvulae conniveutes.

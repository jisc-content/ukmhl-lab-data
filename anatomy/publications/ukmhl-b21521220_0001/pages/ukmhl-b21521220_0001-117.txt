The hiculty of correcting this inverfion feems to be innate ; for new-born animals al- ways fee objeCts upright â€¢, and men who have been horn with cataraCts are obfcrved, upon couching the cataraCts, to fee every thing in its natural fituatioh, without the ufe of any feeling, or previous experiences. The mind is often impofed on by the continuance of the fenfation after it has been conveyed to the mind, by which means objeCts, although inftantly removed, continue to be feen for about a fecond. Hence proceeds the idea of a fiery circle from the circumrotation of a lucid body ; and hence silo proceeds the continuance of the fhining image of the fun, and fometitnes of other bodies, after they have been viewed by the eve.- Do we diftinclly perceive only one object fituated in tire axis of diltmCt vifion ? And does the eye perfuade itfeif, that it fees many objefts at a time, partly from the duration of the ideas, and partly from the quicknefs of the motions of the eye ? In Hi ft i n Ct vilion, We may certainly anfwer thefe quefiions in the affirmative, but not in more imperfeCt vifion. Why do we fee only one objeCt with two eyes ? becaufe, when the impreffions of two objeHs are fimiiar, the fenfation becomes fingle. Even without the concourfe of optic nerves, inleCts who have numerous eyes perceive objects fingle. Hence the images of two objects excite only one fenfation, when they fall upon the fame point of the retina ; but two lenf.t- tions arife from one cbjedt* when the images fall upon diffe- rent parts of the retina. Whence proceed diurnal and noc- turnal blindnefs ? llie former is common to many nations living

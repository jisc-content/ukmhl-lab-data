'1 his Imall lobe is lituated aim oil: horizontally; the great lobe is very much inclined, and its thick exiremity runs down almoft in a perpendicular direction to the right kidney on which it lies, in the manner already laid. This obferva- tion is of ufe to diftmguifh the differeut parts of the liver in wounds and chirurgical operations. It may likewile ferve to diredl us in examining a liver ta- ken out of the body; the fituation which may be other- wife v,erv eafily mifiaken, efpecially that of the parts of the concave fide. The pafiage of the vena cava, between the body of the great lobe and the lobulus Spigelii, may likewife ferve for a rule in placing a detached liver in its true fitua- tion. Structure of the liver. The liver is compofed of feveral kinds of veflels ; the ramifications cf which are multiplied in an affonifhing manner, and form, by the intertexture of their capillary extremities, an innumerable cohesion offmall pulpy friable corpulcles, which are looked upon to be fo many or- gans defigned to feparate from the mafs of blood a particular fluid, termed the bile. ,( The greateft part of thefe veflels, from one end to the .other, is included in a membranous vagina, called capfula venae portae, or capfula Glijfoni, from an Englifh author who firft delcribed it particularly, about the middle of the laft century. This vagina is commonly confidered as a continuation of the membrane which covers the liver, and which penetrates this fubflance along with the blood-veflels; but Sabatier is of opi- nion that it is a continuation of the cellular membrane which covers the vena portae ventralis. The veflel which carries the blood to the liver is called vena portae, for the reafon already given. In the deferip- tion of the veins, we obferved that the vena portae might be

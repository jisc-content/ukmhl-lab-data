It is difficult to fay with certainty â– who difcovered them; but Vefalius is the firft who has i named the malleus and incus ; Arantius or Sylvius, the os (orbiculare; Ingratius is faid to have difcovered the ftapes. Labyrinth. The labyrinth is divided into three parts ; :the anterior, middle, and pofterior. The middle portion i Is termed vejlibulum, the anterior cochlea, and the pofterior labyrinth in particular; which comprehends the three femi- (circular canals. * # The cochlea lies forward and inward toward the extremity cof the pars petrofa ; the femicircular canals backward and coutward toward the bafts of the procefs ; and the veftibulum tbetween the other two. i Vejlibulum. The veftibulum is an irregular round cavity, lefs than the tympanum, and fttuated more inward, and a little more forward. Thefe two cavities are in a manner fet cback to back, with a common partition between them, per- forated in the middle by the feneftra ovalis, by which the ca- vvities communicate with each other. The cavity of the vef- tibulum is likewife perforated by feveral other holes ; on the back fide by the five orifices of the femicircular canals ; on ;lthe lower part of the fore fide by a hole, which is one of the paflages of the cochlea ; and, on the fore fide, toward the internal meatus auditorius, oppofite to the feneftra ovalis, by >a number of very fmall holes, for the pafiage of the nerves ; on the upper fide there are only fmall pores. Semicircular canals. The femicircular canals are only three in number; one vertical, one oblique, and one horizontal; or by fome they are called vertical fuperior, vertical pojlerior, ind horizontal or external. The vertical canal is fituatecl iranfverfely with refpeft to the pars petrofa, the cbnvex fide of

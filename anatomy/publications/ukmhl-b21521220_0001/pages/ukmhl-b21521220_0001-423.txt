SPERMATIC VESSELS. 421 Chap. IV. union of the right renal vein with the vena cava, and fomc- times three veins on the right fide end feparately in the trunk of the vena cava. 1 he l&ft fpermatic vein ends mod com- monly in the vena renalis finifira. After getting into the abdomen they receive a branch which communicates with the vena miferaica, and confe- quently with the vena porta. A little higher, but below the place where they crofs over the ureters, they receive a confi- derable branch, one of which communicates with the vena capfularis, the other frequently with the vena renalis ; and in their whole courfe through the abdomen, they receive branches from the peritonaeum, mefenterv, &.c. They differ from the fpermatic arteries* not only in being larger, and having thinner coats, but alfo in being more di- vided and multiplied in the abdominal muffles ; and as they are formed of a large fafciculus of ramifications, the antients gave to them, and to the arteries, the name of vafa pyramiJa- I'm. ^ Thefe ramifications often communicate with each other in this courfe, and form a great number of areolae, contortions, and convolutions, fo-as to reprefent a kind of plexus, which is connefled to the cellular vagina of each fide by very fine laminae ; and the artery which accompanies the vein erodes it in feveral places, and runs through the areolae in different directions. Thefe frequent convolutions gave rife to the name of vafa pampiniformia, formerly given to thefe' veffels ; and their particular adhefions to each other at fome places, made it be believed that there were real anafiomofes between the artery and the vein. Leal Lealis an Italian anatomifi:, not attending to the late- ral ramifications of the fpermatic arteries and veins, believed himfelf able to eftablifh and demonftrate thefe pretended a- naftomofes. The experiments made by him on living ani- mals prove nothing. His way was, to make a common liga- ture

AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. *53 accidental opening has fometimes happened, and that the fmoke of tobacco has been blown through it during life, is certain. Upon the furface of this membrane, and more efpe- cially upon its conical cavity pointing inward, the fonorou3 waves ftrike, after they have received their lad reflexions from the auditory paflage, by which the elaftic fabric of this membrane is forced into ofcillation. The membrane is ftretchqd over the tympanum, con- taining the little bones to which the imall muf'cles of the internal ear are fixed. By means of the tenfor of the mal- leus, the membrane of the tympanum is the better difpo- fed to hear weak founds; and the other mulcle ferves to moderate thofe that are too violent, by drawing the malleus from the incus; by which means the propagation of the fo- norous tremors is interrupted. If the m&mbrane of the tym- panum be broke, or the bones of hearing diflocated, the per- fon becomes at firft hard of hearing, and afterwards, fays Dr Haller, perfectly deaf. There have been indances, however, where the membrana tympani has been partly deftroyed, and yet the perf'on has retained the fenfe of hearing, though lefs diftinXly than before. The malleus returns the tremors imprefled upon the mem- brane of the tympanum to the incus, which fends it inwards' to the next bones. The Jlapes, aptly enough fo called from its figure, lies in- clined, and is covered by its own mufcle, which feems to draw the ftapes, that it may lie higher up, under the back part of the feneftra ovatis, and pafs out of it before. Thus the nervous pulp of the veftibuium is prefled by the balls of the ftapes, and by the 2ir of the tympanum â€¢, and the Eujla- ehian tube, by the aftion of the circumjacent mufcles, may be comprefled and clofed, and probably a little relaxed and. opened again, by the circumflex mufcle of the muveabk pa- late. By this canal the inlpired air enters into the tyrapa- Vol. II. U runt,

Chap. III. INTESTINUM COLON. 3*19 The villous fubftance of the inner coat of the caecum is very (hort, and furnifhed in feveral places with glandular la- cunae or folitary glands, broader than thofe of the fmall in- teflines. Thefe glandular lacunae or folliculi are flattened and de- prefled in the middle like fmall pox. When we blow through a pipe into thefe lacunae without touching them, the follicu- li are inflated, and reprefent little cups with a hole in the middle of their convex fide. { 8. Inteflinum colon. Situation and ftruclure of the colon The colon is the mod considerable of all the inteftines. From the caecum, of which it is a continuation, it reaches, in form of an arch, above the the umbilical region, and to the lower part of the left hypo- chondrium. Its continuity is, however, a little interrupted by the ileum, which advances into the cavity of the colon, and, together with a certain fold of that inteftine, forms what is called vahntla coli. The whole convex fide of the colon is divided longitudi- nally into three parts, by three mufcular bands, firft known to Sylvius and Euftachius, continued from, and of the fame firufture with, thofe of the caecum. Two of thefe bands run on each fide along the great curvature of the colon and the third along the fmall curvature. The uppermoft band of the two that belong to the great curvature is the broadeft of the three â€¢, that which belongs to the fmall curvature is the narroweft, and it lay hid by the connexion of the mefocolon, till it was brought to light by M. Morgagni. Thefe three longitudinal bands do the office of longi- tudinal fraena, between which this inteftine is, through its whole length, alternately deprefled into tranfverfe folds, and raifed

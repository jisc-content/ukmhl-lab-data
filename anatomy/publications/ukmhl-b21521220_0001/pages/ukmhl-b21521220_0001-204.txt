Between thefe fpongy and elaftic fafciculi, from twelve to fifteen or twenty particular tubes are lodged at fmall diftances from each other, and all in the fame direction. Thefe tubes go to the balls of the papilla, and run through the apex by the fame number of almoft imperceptible holes or orifices j and as they are clofely united to the elaftic fafciculi, they are folded in the latpe manner with them. The body of the papilla is covered by a thin cutaneous production, and by the epidermis. Its outer furface is un- even, being full of fmall tubercles and wrinkles ; among which, thofe near the circumference of the nipple feem to have a tranfverfe or annular difpofition, which, however, is not uniform. This difpofition or direction feems to be owing to the elaf- tic folds already mentioned : And, from this fimple ftruc- ture, it is eafy to explain how infants, in fucking the nipple, and women in drawing the teats of cows, bring out the milk. For the excretory tubes, being wrinkled in the fame manner as the fafciculi, do, by thefe wrinkles or folds, as by fo many valves, hinder the milk contained in the ducts from flowing out ; but, when the nipple is drawn and elongated, the tubes lofe their folds, and the pafiage becomes ftraight. Befides this, when they are drawn with a confiderable force, the whole body of the mamma is increafed in length, and con- tracted in breadth, and thereby the milk is prefTed into the open tubes ; and thus, by barely prefling the body of the breaft, the milk may be forced toward the nipple, and even through the tubes. Thofe who underftand the principles of the air-pump will more readily conceive the manner in which the child draws out the milk. Arteries, veins, nerves, &c. The arteries and veins, diftrr- _ buted through the mammae, are ramifications of the arteriae and i

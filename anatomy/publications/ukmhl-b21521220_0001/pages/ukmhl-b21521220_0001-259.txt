The fubffance of rhe lungs is almoft nil fpongy, being made up of an infinite number of membranous cells, and of different forts of veffels Ipread among thefe cells, in innumerable ramifications. Coats- This whole mafs is covered bjf a membrane conti- nued from each pleura, which is commonly faid to be double ; but what is looked upon as the inner membrane, is only an expanfion and continuition of a cellular fubffance, which fhall be fpoken to after 1 have dcfcribed the veirels of this vif- cus. Bronchia. The veffels which cotnpofe part of the fub- ftarce of the lungs are of thtee or four kinds; the air-vefTels, blond veffels, and lymphatics to which we may add the nerves. The air veffels make the chief part, and are termed 1 bronchia. Thefe bronchia are conical tubeÂ®, compofed of an infinite number of cartilaginous fragments, like fo many irregular arches or circles, connected together by a ligamentary e- laftic membrane, and difppled in fuch a manner as that the lower eafily infinuate themfelves within thole above them. They are lined on the infide by a very fine membrane, which continually difcharges a mucilaginous fluid; in the fubffance of the membrane are a great number of f nail blood-vefiels, and on its convex fide many longitudinal lines, which appear to be partly flefiiy and partly made up of an elaftic fubffance of another kind. The bronchia are divided, in all direiftions into an infinite number of ramifications, which diminifh gradually in fize ; and, as they become capillary, change their cartilaginous ftruc- ture into that of a membrane. Befides thefe very fmall ex- tremities of this numerous feries of ramifications, we find that all the fuborffinatc trunks, from the greateff to the fmalleft, Vol. II, & k fend

The globe of the eye, being the moll: effential of all the foft parts belonging to the organ of fight, and being likewife a part which we are obliged to mention as of- ten as we fpeak of the other foft parts, mud be firft defcri- bed. It confifts of feveral proper parts ; fome of which, being more or lefs folid, reprefent a kind of fhell formed by the union of feveral membranous ftrata, called the coats of the globe of the eye ; and the other parts being more or lels fluid, and contained in particular membranous capfulae, or in the interfiices between the coats, are termed the humours of the globe of the eye. Thefe capfules are likewife termed coats. The coats of the globe of the eye are of three kinds. Some of them form chiefly the {hell of the globe; others are ad- ditional, bemg fixed only to a part of the globe; and others are capfular, which contain the humours. The coats which form the globe of the eye are, the fclerctica or cornea, the choroides, and the retina. The additional coats are two ; one called tendinofa or albuginea, which forms the white of the eye; and the other, tcnjunBiva. The capfular tunicae are likewife two, the vitrea and the crvftallina. The globe of the eye, thus formed, receives from behind a large pedicle, which is the continuation of the optic nerve. It is fituated about the middle of the orbit, in the manner which we fiiall afterwards fee ; and is tied to it by the optic nerve, by fix mufcles, by the tunica conjundliva, and by the palpebrae. The back part of the globe, the optic nerve, and mufcles, are furrounded by a foft fatty fubftance, which fills the reft of the bottom of the orbit.

/ â€¢hap. IV. r E N I S. 427 The figure of the glans is that of a rounded cone, a little flattened at the lower part, and with an oblique prominent bafis, the circumference of which is fomething greater than that of the corpora cavernofa. The fpongy fubftance of the glans is thick and uniform next the corpora cavernofa ; but next the urethra it is per- v forated by a continuation of that canal, and Is there no thick- er than the urethra before the formation of the glans. Therefore the canal of the urethra does not lie in the mid- dle of the glans, but continues its direct cO'urfe through the .lower flat fide of it, all the way to the extremity, where it terminates by an oblong orifice. All the convex furface of the glans is Covered by a fine vil- lous fubftance, and that again by a fine membrane, refem- bling the red part of the lips. The circumference of the bafis of the glans has a double row of finall papillae. Which may be reckoned febaceous glands, from which a thick mat- ter is difcharged. Caruncula. We have feveral things to take notice of in the cavity of the urethra. At the bottom of the cavity of the firft portion, or that which lies within the proftates, there is a finall oblong oval eminence, large on the back part, and terminating forward in a point, called caruncula, or veru- montanum, The large portion of it is commonly perforated by two holes, fometimes only by or.e, and very feldom by three; and theft are the excretory orifices of the veliculae feminales; of which hereafter. Each orifice has a fmall thin membranous border, which may fcrve for valves to the ex- cretory dudls of the veliculae. \ On each fide of the large portion of the caruncula, there are five or fix holes ranked inform of a crefcent round its lateral parts, which are the orifices of the excretory d tufts of the proftates that come from the folliculi.already mentioned, and

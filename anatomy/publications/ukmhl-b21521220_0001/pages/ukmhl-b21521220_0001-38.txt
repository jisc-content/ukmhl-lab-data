THE BRAIN, 35 Part VF. may be looked upon as one middle medullary bnfis, common to both cerebrum and cerebellum, by the reciprocal continu- ity of their medullary fuhllances, through the great notch in the tranfverfe feptum of the dura mater; which common bafi' lies immediately on that portion of the dura mater lining the bafis of the cranium. The medulla oblongata is there- fore juftly efteemed to be a third general part of the whole mafs of the brain, or as the common production, or united elonguion, of the whole medullary fubftahee of the cerebrum and cerebellum. It is extremely difficult, if not altogether impoffible, to ex- amine or demonftrate it as we ought, in its natural fituation ; bu; we are obliged to do both on a brain inverted. The lower tide of the medulla oblongata, in an inverted fituation preterits to out view levers] parts, which are in ge- neral e th. r meduilary productions, trunks of nei ves, or trunks of blood vcfl'els. The chief medullary productions are thefe ; the large or anterior branches of the medulla oblongata, which have likeâ€” wile been named crura anteriora, femora, and brachia medullae oblongat ae, and ptduncuii cerebri: The tranfverfe protuberance, called hkewife procejfus annularis or pons Varolii: The fmall or poflerior branches, called pedumuli ctrebelli, or crura pojlerio ra medullae oblongatae : The extremity or cauda of the medul- la oblongata, with two pairs of tubercles; one of which is named corpora olivaria, the other corpora pyramidaha ; and to all thefe productions we mull add a production of the infun- dibulum and two medullary papillae. 'J he great branches of the medulla oblongata are two very confiderable medullary fafciculi; the anterior extremities of which are feparated, and the poftenor united, fo that, taken together, they fomewhat reprefent a'Roman V. 1 hefe fas- ciculi are flat, much broader before than behind ; the* tur- t T faces being compoied of leveral longitudinal and diftinCtly prominent-

Part VI. LIEN. 372 convexity of the ftomach, the other to that of the colon. The convex fide of the fpleen is turned to the left ribs. It is connected to the ftomach by the vrffels called vafa brevia ; to the extremity, of the pancreas, by ramifications of ; the Iplenic artery and veins ; and to the omentum, by rami- fications which the lame artery and vein fend to the Ipleen, and which run in the longitudinal groove. » It is connected to the edge of the diaphragm by a particu- lar membranous ligament of different breadths in different fubjrtfts, fixed in its convex fide, fometimes near the upper edge fometimes near the lower. '1 his ligament is fituated tranfv ericly with relp (ft to the whole, body, and longitudi- nally with rclpetft to the fize of the Ipleen. In fome fubjefts, it is connrtftrj by other ligaments to the ftomach and colon; bur in all this there are confiderable varities. The figure ot the Ipleen is not always regular, and is as various, as, the fize. Sometimes it has confiderable fciffures both m the tides and edges, and fometimes it has appendices. I have fometimes found a kind of imall diftintft fpleens, more or left lound, and connetfttd feparately to the omentum, at fome diltance fiom the anterior extremity cf the ordinary Ipleen. StruBure of the fpleen. The flru<fture of the fpleen is not ealy to be unto.ded in man ; and it is very different from that ot the fpleens of orutes. Its coverings adhere jro it fo cloftly in man, that it is diffi- cult to dillinguilh the common trom the proper coat ; where- as m fome brutes, iuch as oxen, ihcep, See. nothing is more ealy ; for i’1 animals we find two coats leparated by a cellular lubftance. This covering ieems to be no other-wile a continuation of the peritonaeum than by the intervention of the omentum and u.efocolon and even in man the two coats may be diftinguifhed, where the veffels enter by the longitudinal feiffure.

Chap. L AND ITS APPENDAGES. 3S fiance. Tliefe ramifications have been named arbor vitae'; and the two trunks, from whence thefe different laminae arife, are called pedunculi cerehelli. We cannot go on with the description of the other middle parts of the bafis of the cerebellum, before that of the middle parts of the balls of the cerebrum ■, becaufe thefe two parts are united, and jointly form the medulla oblongata. We fhall only add here, that the flrata of both fubftances of the cerebellum are not always of the fame extent in the fame por- tions or protuberances of each lobe. This appears merely by viewing the convex or outer fin face of the cerebellum ; for there we fee, at different dillances, fome cortical flrata fliorter than others, and likewile that the extremities of the fhcrfc flrata gradually diminilh in thicknefs, till they are quite loft between two long ones. If we make a fmall hole in the external lamina of the pia mater, over one of the lobes of the cerebellum, without touch- ing the inner lamina, and then blow into the cellular fub- ftance, connedling thefe two laminae, through a fmall pipe introduced into the hole ; the air will gradually fwell that fubflance, and feparate the flrata more or Iefs equally from each other through their whole extent ; and we fhall fee at the fame time the difpolition of all the membranous fepta or duplicatures of the internal lamina of the pia mater, with the numerous diftribution of the fine blood veffels which run up- on it, efpecially after a lucky injection, or in an inflammatory flate of thefe membranes. § 5. Medulla oblongata„ The medulla oblongata is a medullary fubflance, fltuated from before backward, in the middle part of the bafes of the cerebrum and cerebellum, without any difcontinuation, be- tween the lateral parts of both thefe bales j and therefore it may

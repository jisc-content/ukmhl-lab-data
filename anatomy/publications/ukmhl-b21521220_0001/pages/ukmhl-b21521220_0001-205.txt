Chap. II. PLEURAE and MEDIASTINUM. *03 and venae mammariae; of which one kind comes from ths fubclaviae, and are named mammariae internae; the others, from the axillares, called mainmariae extcrnae. Thefe velTels communicate with each other, with thofe near them, and with the vafa epigaftrica. The nerves come chiefly from the coftales, and, by means of thefe, communi- cate with the great nervi fympathetici. The mamma has numerous lymphatic veflels, which Wrilberg obferves run in two fets : Mod of thefe veflels gradually collect into a great plexus, which go to the axillary glands; but others enter the thorax, through the interftices of the ribs, near the fter- num, and communicate with the glands behind the mam- mary veflels. ยง 3. Pleurae and Mediajlinum. The pleura is a membrane which adheres very clofely to the inner furface of the ribs, fternum, and mufculi interco da- les, fub-coftales, and fterno-coflales, and to the convex fide of the diaphragm. It is of a very firm texture, and is fup- plied with blood-veflels and nerves, in all which it refem- bles the peritonaeum ; and likewife in its confifting of an inner true membranous lamina, and a cellular fubftance on the outfide. " Each fide of the thorax has its particular pleura, entirely diftintt from the other, and making, as it were, two great bladders, fituated laterally with refpefl to each other in the great cavity of the bread, in fuch a manner as to form a double feptum or partition running between the vertebrae and the fternum, their other fides adhering to the ribs aud diaphragm. This particular duplicature of the two pleurae is termed mediajlinum. The two laminae of which it confifts are clofely united together near the fternum and vertebrae; but, in the middle.

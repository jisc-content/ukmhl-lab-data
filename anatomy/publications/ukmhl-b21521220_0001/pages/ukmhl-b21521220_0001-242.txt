24Â® BLOOD And JUICES. Part VL of the patient, and from experiments made on living animals by drawing out all their blood, the mafs of circulating hu- j mours will be at lead fifty pounds ; of which, about 28 will j be true red blood, running in the arteries and veins ; of which the arteries contain only four parts, and the veins nine. The blood does not always contain the fame proportion of \ the principles above mentioned: For an increafed celerity, whether by laborious and ftrong exercifes, a full age, fever, or otherwife, augments the crafiarnemum, the rednefs, the con- gealing force, and thecohefion of the particles; and the hard- nefs and weight of the concreted ferum with the alkaline principles are increafed by the fame means. On the other hand, the younger and lefs adtive animal, and the more wa- tery or vegetable the diet on which it is fed, the crafiamen- tum of the blood is proportionally leffened, and its ferum and mucus increafed Old age, again, ieflens the crafiamentum, and the gelatinous part likewife. From thefe principles, and a due confideration of the folid fibres and veflels, the different temperaments are de- rived. For a plethoric or /anguine habit arifes from an a- bundancce of the red globules ; a phlegmatic temperature from a redundancy of the watery parts of the blood; a choleric difpofition of the humours feems to arife from a more acrid and alkalefcent property of the blood ; as appears from thofe who live on flefh and on the human fpecies, being fo much i fiercer and more pafilonate than thofe who live on vegetable food. A great firmnefs in the folid parts, joined with an \ exquifite fenfibility, or nervous irritability, difpofes to a cho- leric habit; a lefs irritability, with a moderate denfity, to a fanguine habit; and a lefler degree, both of denfity and irri- tability, are to be referred to a phlegmatic temperament. There is alfo a kind of dull heavy temperament, in which there is the greateft ftrength of body, joined with no great degree of irritability. In the' melancholic, again, a wcaknefs of

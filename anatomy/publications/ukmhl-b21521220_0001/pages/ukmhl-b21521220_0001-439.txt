Chap. IV. x SECRETION of the SEMEN. - 437 The femen is conveyed by the vafa deferentia into the ve- ficulae feminales, being propelled forward by the motion of the fucceeding juices in the tefticle; and perhaps, in fome meafure, though flowly, by the contraction of the cremafter. This fuppoiition is confirmed by the numerous fpires and convolutions formed by'the epidydimis, obftruding ahnoft every kind of injedion ; and, by the length of time that is required to fill the feminal veficles again, after they have been once exhaulted. The cylindric yas deferens, confiding of a very thick fpon- gy fubfiance, included between two firm membranes, a/cends in company with the cord of the fpermatic veffels, and to- gether with them paffes through the ring of the abdomen : Thence it defcends into the pelvis, and applying itfelf to the bladder between the ureters, it foon alter meets the lubjacent receptacles, called the right and left vefculae feminales Here it goes along the inner fide of the velicle, as far as the pro- late gland ; and, dilating in its pafiage, forms a Terpentine flexune, 'that begins to put on acellular appearance. But very near the proftate, being contipued from thefe cellular bendings, with a conical dud coming out from the veficle, > it unites in a very acute angle, which at the fame time forms a conical dud; whiclj being continued with the vas deferens, and finking through the proftate gland, is there wrinkled into a large fold, and going off outward at right angles from its companion on the other fide, and afterwards ftraightened, it opens into the urethra, through a little hollowâ€™protube- rance, which has a long tail or dcfcent, and is laterally per- forated with two very fmall openings, one on each fide. By injeding liquor into the vas deferens of a dead fubjed, we perceive that it flows both into the urethra and into the fe- minal veficle, but more readily into the former : But in a living perfon the femen never flows out but in the ad of ve- nery, and confequently the Vas deferens conveys all its femen, without

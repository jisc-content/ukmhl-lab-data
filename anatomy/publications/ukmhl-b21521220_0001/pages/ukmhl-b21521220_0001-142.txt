THE EAR, 140 Part VI. of it being turned upward. The oblique canal lies farther back than the former, and runs parallel to the length of the procefs, the convex fide being turned backward, with one extremity upward, the other downward. The fuperior ex- tremity of this canal meets and lofes itfelf in the internal ex- tremity of the former. The curvature and extremities of the horizontal canal are almoft on a level; the curvature lying obliquely backward, and the extremities forward, ending under thofe of the ver- tical canal, but a little nearer each other, the inner being al- moft in the middle fpace between the extremities of the oblique canal. The horizontal canal is generally the leaft of the three ; the oblique is often, and the vertical fometimes, the greateftj and fometimes thefe two are equal. All the three canals are larger than a femicircle, forming nearly three quarters ; they are broader at the orifices than in the middle. Thefe orifi- ces open into the back-fide of the veftibulum, and are but five in number, becaufe two of them open into each other ; fo that, in the pofterior part of the veftibulum, two appear toward the in fide, and three toward the outfide. In children, the fubftnnce of thefe canals is compaft, while that which furrounds them is fpongy. Hence .they may be eafily feparated from the reft of the pars petrofa. In adults, all the parts of the bone are fo folid, that thefe canals appear only like paflages formed in a piece of ivory. From this de- fcription, it is eafy to diftinguiih the right labyrinth from the left. Cochlea. The cochlea is a fort of fpiral body with two dufls, formed in the anterior part of the pars petrofa, fome- what refembling the fliell of a fnail. The parts to be diftin- guifhed in it, in its true fituation, are, the bafis; the apex ; the fpiral lamina, or half feptum, by which its cavity is di- vided into two half canals ; the modiolus or fpindle, round which

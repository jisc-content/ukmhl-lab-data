Chap. II. RESPIRATION. 279 fed together, repels the venous blood into the veins of the head, and fills the brain and its finufes. The inconveniences produced by exfpiration, excite new efforts for repeating the refpirat:on ; bccaufe the collapfed vcffels of the lungs refill the blood expelled from the right ventricle of the heart. Hence the caule of death in thofc « animals which expire in veffels exhaufted of air : For their lungs being void of air, become denle, lohd, and heavier than water, whence they are rendered impervious to the blood. Of the fame kind is the death of thole who are killed by lightning, and, perhaps, by the noxious vapours of caverns. How admirable are the liructure and mechanifm in thefe or- I ■ gans of relpiration 1 The unealy fenfations of a too long con- tinued exfpiration, which arile from hindrances of the blood’s paffage through the lungs, excite into adtion the powers of inlbiration, whereby the blood’s paffage through the lungs is rendered again more free and eafy ; and, vice verfa, the uneafinefs proceeding from a too long continued infpiration, excite the powers of exfpiration. It is queftioned, by fome authors, Whether or no there are not other caufes of alternate relpiration ? Whether or no we may hope for any difeovery in this matter by comprefling the vena fine pnri, the phrenic nerve, or intercepting the blood lent to the brain ? But thefe opinions are repugnant to comparative anatomy, by which we always find the fame al- ternation in the breathing of the animal, independent of any fuch nerve or vein. Whether or no relpiration is from the alternate contraction of the antagonift mufcles, among which thofe of exfpiration relax the others of inspiration, and the reverfe ? This doctrine leems improbable, becaufe all the mufcles of the human body are perpetually in an alternate motion. From what has been hitherto faid, it appears, that refpira- tion is unavoidably and abfolutely neceffary to life in a healthy

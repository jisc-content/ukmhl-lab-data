\ 4*8 PENIS.' Part VI. \ and run in an oblique courfe to the orifices, in a kind of membranous duplicature. > Corpora caverhofa The corpora cavernofii are two ligamen- tary and very limber tubes, united laterally to each other v through the givateft part of their length, and folid at their two extrt mities ; two of which are connected together, and rounded like the end of a finger; the other two divaricate, like the branches of the Greek r ; and diminilhiug gradual- ly in fize after the divarication, terminate in an oblique point. Thefe divaricated and pointed extremities may be called the rootSy and the round extremities the heads. Thefe two bodies are atmofi cylindrical, being round, and of an equal diameter from the roots to the heads, where they are in fome mealufe conical. The ligamentary fubflance of their Tides is elaftic, and compcfed of fine clofe fibres, which are partly tranfverfe, and partly more or lefs oblique. The cavity of thefe ligamentary tubes is entirely filled by flrong cellular or cavernous fubflance, which doeÂ£ not feena to be a continuation of the fubflance of the fides. Thefe cells communicate with each other, and are always more or lefs full of blood, refembling very much'the cellular fubflance of the fpleen, only with this difference, that the fides of the cells are thicker in thefe cavernous bodies, and without any additional fubllance. By the union of the two corpora cavernofa, two external grooves are formed; one on the upper fide, the other on the lower. The lower groove is fomething broader than the up- per; and it is filled through its whole length by a third tube, narrower than the corpora cavernofa, called the urethra; which fhkll be prel'ently deferibed. The roots of the corpora cavernofa are fixed, each to the edge of the fmall ramus of the ifehium and os pubis. They meet at the fymphyfis of the ofla pubis, where each of them becomes

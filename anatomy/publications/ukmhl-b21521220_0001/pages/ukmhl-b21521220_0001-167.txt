CTiap. T. 265 AND ITS APPENDAGES. monly reckon three pairs j fiylo-gloffi, hyo-gloffi, genio- gloffi. rIhe mufcles which move the os hyoides belong likewife to the tongue. The names of thefe are, Mylo-hyoidaii, genic- hyci daei, Jlylo-hyoidaei, omo- hyci daei, J}et no hyoidati. When either of the fiylo-gloffi adls, it turns the tongue toward the cheek, and forces the aliment betwetn the upper and lower molares. When they ad! jointly with the lateral portions of the fuperior fielhy plane of the tongue, they turn the tongue obliquely upward to the teeth of the upper jaw, and near the cheeks, as when we bring down any part of the food that may have buck there after matticatton. When they ad! jointly with the lateral portions of the hyo gloffi, they turn the tongue downward between the lower teeth and the cheek. When all the parts of the hyo-gloffi ad! together, they fhorten the tongue. They ltkewiie turn the point of the tongue between the teeth and the under lip, and make it pafs over that lip. The fuperior fielhy plane of the body of the tongue bends it upward toward the palate, and makes it pafs along and lick the upper lip. The tongue is fixed in the mouth, not only by mufcles, but alio by ligaments, which are lor the moll part mem- branous. I he principal ligament is that called the frainnm, which is the prominent fold that appears firl! under the tongue when we raife it, with the mouth opened ; and is no more than a continuation or lo fe dnplicature of that mem- brane which covers the inferior cavity of the mouth. It co- vers the curvature of the anterior portion of the genio glnffi from the point of the tongue, almol! as high as the middle interlfice between the lower dentes tncifurii. The other ligaments of the tongue are the fmall membra- nous fold which runs along the middle of the convex fide of the epiglottis, to the bafii3 of the tonaue, and the membranous folds

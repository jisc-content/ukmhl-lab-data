Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. ii? the internal nares, the finus frontales, finus maxillares, finus fphenoidales, the du&us lacrymales, and dudtus palatini. The firm or hard parts are moftly bony, and the reft car- tilaginous, viz, the os frontis, os ethmoides, os fphenoides, ofla maxillaria, ofla nafi, ofla unguis, ofla palati, vomer, con- chae iaferiores, and the cartilages. To thefe we may add the periofteum and perichondrium, as parts belonging to the bones and cartilages. The foft parts are the integuments, mufcles, facculus lacry- malis, membrana pituitaria, veflels, nerves, and hairs of the nares. The bony parts have been all explained in the de- fcription of the Ikeleton ; and therefore we need only in this place notice their diftribution and difpofition, as far as relates to the formation of fome of the principal parts. The fep- tum is formed by the defcending lamina of the os ethmoides, and by the vomer ; and it is placed in the groove framed by the criftae of the ofla maxillaria, and riling edges of the ofla palati. The fore part of the nofe is formed by the ofla nafi ; and the fides, by the fuperior apophyfes of the ofla maxil- laria. The internal nares, or the two cavities of the nofe, com- prehend the whole fpace between the external nares and pofterior openings, immediately above the arch of the palate, from whence thefe cavities reach upward as far as the lamina cribrofa of the os ethmoides, where they communicate for- ward with the finus frontales, and backward with the finus fphenoidales. Laterally, thefe cavities are bounded on the infide by the feptum narium ; and on the outfide, or that next the cheek, by the conchae or ofla fpongiofa, between which they communicate with the finus maxillaris. The particular fituation of thefe cavities deferves our at- tention. The bottom of them runs dire&ly backward, fo that a ftraight and large probe may eafily be paffed from the external nares, under the great apophyfis of the occipital bone.

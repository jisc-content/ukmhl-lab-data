DIGESTION. Part VF. 5$2 I internal fphinElery by which the opening of the anus is do- fed. /â–  Tde villous coat of the inteftine lias a very rough furface, is extremely porous, and full of reticulated polygonal wrin- kles, and is furnilhed with fome peculiar iit.ules. That part of the inreiline which is next to the fkin or outward opening forms a white firm circle like a valve, into which delcend the longitudinal fi/lds. Between thele folds are iniet ttpted finufes, hollo\v upwards, and of a greater depth towards the lower extremity of the intelline. The mouths of the large mucous glancuhs open into thele cavities ; while the margin of tl>e anu itfelf is defended by lebaceous glandules, It ft it fhould be excoriated by the hard acrid fece*. Whenever, therefore, the feces are colkded within the redum, in luch a quantity as to become trou.slefome by their weight, irritation, or acrimony, they excite an um-afinefs through the adjacent vifeera ; and are then, by the fot'ce of the diaphragm and abdominal mufcles, prtlTed downwards through the inner rim of the pelvis, fo as to urge upon the contents of the lefs refilling bladder and redum. Wfien the refiftance of the ai us is thus overcome, the comprcffing forces of the diaphragm abate, and the feces continue to dif- charge from the body, urged only by the peril!altic motion of the inteftine. After the feces are expelled, the inicltine, by its longitudinal fibres, is drawn back or up into the body j after which, the opening of the anus itfelf is clofely contrad- ed by the two proper fphindtrs as at firft. The feces in men and carnivorous animals are very foetid, almofl putrid, fubal- kaline, foft, and contain much oil intimately mixed with falts, which are left both by the aliments, as well as by the bile and other humours of the human body, An acrid and foetid water returns from the feces into the blood ; hence eoflivenefs in fevers is hurtful, putrefadicn being incrcafed by

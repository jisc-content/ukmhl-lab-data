I 212 HEART. Part VI. The anterior or right ventricle is fome what larger than the potterior or left, as was well obferved by the antients, and clearly demonftrated by M. Helvetius. The left is a little longer than the right, and in fome fubje&s they end exteriorly in a kind of double apex. But it appears from experiments, that the inequality between the parts of the right and thofe of the lett fide of the heart are not fo great during life as after death; for, in the hearts of animals killed by cutting acrofs the vefi'els of the neck, and in thofe of per- fons who have died in battle from a wound in the vena cava or pulmonary artery, the inequality is lefs than, we commonly find it. This was firft obferved by M. Vieuffens proteffor of anatomy at Altorf. Sabatier has made numerous experiments on animals, the refult of which is nearly the fame with that mentioned above. All the fibres are not dire&ed the fame way, though they are all more or lefs oblique: For fome end toward the right, others toward the left, fome forward, fome backward, and others in the intermediate places; fo that, in unravelling them, we find that they crois each other gradually, fome- times according to the length of the heart, and iometimes according to its breadth. The tubes which crofs each other tranfverfely are much more numerous than thofe which crofs longitudinally; which ought to be taken notice of, that we may rectify the falfe no- tions that have been entertained concerning the motion of the heart, namely, that it is performed by a contortion or twitt- ing like that of a fcrew, or that the heart is fhortencd in the ~ time of contra&ion, and lengthened in dilatation. The fibres which compofe the inner or concave furface of the ventricles do not all reach to the bafis, fome of them run- ning into the cavity, and there forming the flefhy colum- nae, to which the loofe floating portion of the tricufpidal val- ves is fattened by tendinous ropes.

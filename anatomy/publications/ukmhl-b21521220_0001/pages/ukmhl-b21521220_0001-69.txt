The prerogative of exciting vital motions, is not more peculiar to the cerebellum than to the other parts of the ence- phalon ; nor does it fufficiently appear, that the vital and animal functions are didinbc: For the cerebellum does not produce the' nerves of the heart and of the other vital or- gans, and the brain thofe which go to the organs of fenle and voluntary motion. From the cerebellum the fifth nerve is mod evidently produced ; but that goes to the tongue, pterygoid, buccinator, temporal and frontal mufcles, to the ear, the eye, the noftrils; parts which are either moved by the will, or deffined for fenfe. Again, the fame nerve, like the eighth, fends vital branches to the heart and lungs, ani- mal and voluntary ones to the larynx, and fenfitive ones to the llomach. Again, it is not even true that diforders of the cerebellum bring on fb certain and fpeedy death as is ge- nerally imagined for fome experiments, even of our own making, fhevv that it has born wounds and fcirrhi, without taking away life. Laftly, it is not much different from the brain, only that it is fofter and more tender; and we have often known wounds of the cerebellum cured. The power, however, of this part, in exciting convulfions, is fomewhat greater than that of the brain. We mud inquire experimentally concerning the feat of the foul. In the fird place it mud be in the head, and not in the fpinal marrow : For though this is obftruded, the con- ftancy of the mind remains the fame. Again, from the ex- periment of convulfions arifing, when the inmod parts of the brain are irritated, it appears to be feated, not in the cortex, but in the medulla ; and, by a probable conjecture, in the crura of the medulla, the corpora driata, thalami, pons, me- dulla oblongata, and cerebellum. And again, by another pot abfurd conjedture, it is perhaps feated at the origin of every

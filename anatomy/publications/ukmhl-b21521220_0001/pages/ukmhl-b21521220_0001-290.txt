M RESPIRATION. PartVh of the air Is colledted in the mod Ample manner by almoft every body. From all thefe experiments we collect, I* That there is in the air a fluid which, in different ways, may be increafed in one place, and diininifhed in ano- ther j which, when colledted by proper machines, exhibits cledtric fparks; but, when colledted in the clouds, breaks forth in thunder and lightning. “ 2. If from its too great congeftion, in any region of the atmofphere, or in the clouds, the circumambient air wants its due proportion, our refpiration is lefs refrefhing, and our •firength grows languid ; but they are quickly renewed after a thunder lform, the equilibrium of the eledtric matter in the atmolphere being reftored, as it were, by the flafhes of light- ning. “ 3. Perhaps we may at length arrive at the knowledge of fomc artificial means by which we may be able to fupply this defedt of eledtricity in the atmofphere. A farther inveftiga- tion of this fubjedt may perhaps be not altogether ufelefs. “ 4. This eledtric matter pafles into the blood or lymph by innumerable pores and foramina, with which the infide of the larynx, al’pera arteria, and bronchia, abound. Upon the diversity of thefe holes^ both with refpedt to the number, condition, and the mucus with which they may be covered, and to the fize of the lungs, depends the reafon why all men cannot inhale and abforb the fame quantity of eledlric matter N 1 from one and the fame air. “ 5. As fufficient obfervations on this new fubject have not yet been made, it is difficult to determine what ufe this fub- Itance ferves in animal bodies, and what fundtions depend upon it. Is the tone and irritability of the fibres of the body principally fupported by it ? Do the caufes of ani- mal hefit proceed from it ? The animal eledlricity, which is very confpicuous in cats, horfes, and alfo in men, by the numerous fparks feen to ifiue from their bodies, probably proceeds

4io SECRETION of URINE. Part VL , / ~ * obferving, tHat part of the blood is changed by the kidney - into this fluid. The urine, by lire or putrefaction, fometimes by difeafe, in fomc animals more eafily than in others, changes into a volatile alkaline nature, intimately mixed with a fetid oil. This oil which is partly empyreumatic, yellow, volatile, te- nacious, feparable only by the greateft degrees of fire, is known by the denomination of phofphorus •, it is a fhining fubftance, taking fire fpontaneoufly in the air. The urine abounds more with earth than any other juice of the human body, both of a cretaceous and fparry nature; the latter com- ing chiefly from the drink, the former from the folid parts of the body diflolved and mixed with the blood. There is al- fo a confiderable proportion of fea-falt in frefh urine ; from which it is even feparable after a long putrefaction, in the making of phofphorus; in which procefs a very great part of the urine is changed into volatile alkali. Nor is the urine, both of men and brutes, wholly deftitute of a vitriolic acid, or at leaf! a fimilar acid. There is likewife in the frefh urine a fufible cooling fait, fimilar to nitre. In fevers, the oily and faline parts of the urine are greatly augmented, both in quan- tity and acrimony. lhat the urine is feparated in the kidneys is (hewn experi- mentally, by preffing it out of their veflels. That it defcends by the ureters is (hewn by the furprifing fwelling of the kid- ney, and that part of the ureter which is above, as well as the emptinels of that part which is below the ligature. In the bladder al('o, as well as in the kidneys and ureters, there is an immenfe 1 welling as often as the bladder cannot receive the urine, or cannot emit it. Nor does there feem to be any other way for the urine to pafs. F- r, although it is certain that the fiomach, like all other membranes,’exhales a moifture through its coats; though it is rot improbable, from experiments, that the blad-

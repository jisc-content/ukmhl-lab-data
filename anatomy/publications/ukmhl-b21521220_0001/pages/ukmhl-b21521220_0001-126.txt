Part VI. 124 THE NOSE, ternal narcs, crofs the arch of the palate, and open behind the firft or largett dentes inciforii. Their two orifices may be diftinftly feen in the lkeleton at the lower part ot the nafal foflae, on the anterior and lateral fnles of the criitae maxillares; and we may likewife perceive their oblique pafTage through the maxillary bones; and laftly, their inferior ori- fices, in a fmall cavity or foflula, calied foramen palatinum an- ierius. In frefh fubjetts they are not to apparent, efpec aily in human fubjects; but in fheep and oxen ti.ey are eafily difcoverable. Arteries and veins. The arteries of all thefe parts come chiefly from the external carotid. Thofe of the external parts of the nofe are chiefly branches and rami of the arteria maxillaris externa or angularis, and of the temporalis; and the arteries of the tnicrnal parts are branches and ramifica- tions of the maxillaris interna, and likewife fmall branches from the ocular artery. The veins are, almoft in the lame manner, branches and ramifications of the external jugular; and they communicate with the orb'tary finufes, and, by that means, with the finus of the dura mater, and with the inter- nal jugulars. Nerves. 1 he principal nerves belonging to the nofe are filaments of the nervi olfa&orii, which run down through the holes of the traniverfe lamina of the os ethmoides, and are aiftributed to the common membrane of the internal nares, efpecially to its villous portions The inner ramus of the orbitary or ophthalmic fends a filament through the internal anterior orbitary hole into the cranium, which comes out again in company with one of the filaments of the olfac- tory nerve through the ethmoidal lamina. This internal ramus advances afterwards toward the os unguis; and is diftributed partly to the facculus lacrymalis, partly to the upper portion of the mufculus levator alae nafi, and cf the integuments of the nofe. The fuborbitary nerve, which

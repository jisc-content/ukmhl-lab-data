It is commonly laid that this obliquity reprefents the figure 8 ; but the comp'arifon is very falle, and can only agree to fome bad figures drawn by perlons ignorant of the laws of petite ^ All thefe fibres, regard being had to their different obli- quity and length, are difpofed in fuch a manner, as that the longeft form partly the mod external ftrata on the convex fide of the heart, and partly the moll internal on the con- cave fide; the middle of the arches and the angles meeting obliquely and fucceffively to form the apex. The fibres fituated within thefe long ones grow gradually fhorter and ftraighter all the way to the bafis of the heart, where they are very fhort, and very little in-curvated. By this difpofition the fides of the ventricles are very thin near the apex of the heart, and very thick toward the bafis. Each ventricle is compofed oi its proper dillindt fibres; but the left ventricle has many more than the right, its fub- ftance being conliderably thicker. Where the two ventricles are joined, they form an impervious leptum which belongs equally to both. Oppolite to this leptum a groove is feen on the outfide of the heart; one running longitudinally on its upper, the other on its under furface: In thefe grooves the great branches of the coronary arteries and veins are lodged. There is this likewife peculiar to the left ventricle, that the fibres which form the innermoft llratum of its concave fide, form the outermoft ftratum of the whole convex fide of the heart, which confequently is common to both ven- tricles; fo that, by carefully unravelling all the fibres of the heart, we find it to be made no of two bags contained in a third.

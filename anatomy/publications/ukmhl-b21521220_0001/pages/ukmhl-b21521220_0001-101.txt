Some fmall vafcular filaments from theie ramifications, are likevvife obferved to adhere very cloicly to the tunica vitrea; and they tend, in a direfl courfe to the circumference of the iris, home fmall arteries, which there form a vaicuiar circle that gives capillaries o the mem* brana cryftailina. Thefe vcfiels may be eafily injected in new born chilJren. The potlerior part of the caplule of the lens is fupplied from another fource : Albinas', and after him many others, have injedled, in a foetus, a branch from the arteria centralis retinae, which palles through the middle of the vitreous humour, and is difperied in a radiated manner on the back part of the caplula cryftailina. Zinn is of opi- nion that thefe veflels pafs alio into the body of the lens; but of this lufiicient proofs are wanting. The veins of all thefe parts anfwer nearly to the arteries; thofe of the globe of the eye are called vnfa vorticofa. The internal veins unload themlelves, partly into the internal ju- gular vein, by the finus cavernofi ; and partly into the exter- nal jugular vein, by the vena angularis, or maxillaris externa, the maxillaris interna, temporalis, See. Befides the capillary velfels, eafily diftinguifhable by the red colour of the blood, there are great numbers of thofe which admit nothing but the ferous and lymphatic parts of the blood, and confequentiy do not appear in the natural ftate. They become vifibie in fome places by inflammations and injections, as on the membrana conjunctiva of the eye ; but thefe contrivances do not dilcover them every where in aged perfons. In a foetus, and in new born children, fays Window, a fine injection has fucceeded fo Well as to dilcover the veffels of the membrana cryftailina and vitrea; and in-a foetus of about fix months, the injected liquor feemed to me to have penetrated a part of the cryftalline and vitreous hu- mour.

Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. of diftinft vaginae as there are holes in the lamina ethmoi- dalis; and fome nerves, as the nin^h pair, are accompanied by feveral vaginae through one hole. There are two particular elongations which form the peri- ofteum of the orbits, together with the vaginae of the optic nerves. Thefe orbitary elongations go out by the luperior orbitary fifiures, or foramina lacera of the fphenoid bone; and, increafing in breadth in their pafTage, line the whole cavity of the orbits, at the edges of which they communicate with the pericranium and periofteum of the face. They communicate likewife, through the fpheno-maxillary or infe- rior orbitary fifiures, with the pericranium of the temporal and zygomatic fofiae ; and by thefe communications vve may explain the accidents which happen to thefe parts in wounds of the head. The elongations of the dura mater, which accompany the blood-veflels through the foramina of the cranium, unite with the pericranium immediately afterwards. Such, for in- ftance, are the elongations which line the foflulae of the fo- ramina lacera or jugularia, and the bony or carotid canals of the apophyfis petrofa, &.c. Arteries. The veffcls of the dura mater are arteries, veins, and finufes. The arteries, in general, are diftinguifhed into anterior, middle, and pofterior, and come from the carotids and vertebrales on each fide. The external carotid lends a branch through the fpinal hole of the os fphenoidale, which is the middle artery of the dura mater; and is called, by way of eminence, arteria clurae matris. It is divided into a great number of branches, which are plentifully difperfed through the fubfiance of the external lamina as high as the falx, where thefe ramifications communicate with their fellows from the other fide. The impreflions of this artery are feen on the infide of the parietal bones; the anterior and lower ' tingle of which, inftcad Qf a Ample impreffion, contains a canal

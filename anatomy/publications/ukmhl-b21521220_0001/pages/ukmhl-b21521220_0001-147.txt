The external lamina is in fome meafure a produftion of the ikin and cuticula of the external meatus; for they may be pulled at the fame time like the finger of a glove. The internal lamina is a continuation of the periof- teum of the tympanum; and, when the membrane has been macerated in water, each of thele lamina may be fubdivided into feveral others. In very young children, this membrane is covered on the outfide by a thick mucilaginous web. The depreffion in the middle of the membrana tympani, is caufed by the adhefion of the malleus, the handle of which is clofely joined to the infide of the membrane, from the upper part of the circumference all the way to the centre, to which the end of the handle is fixed. This handle leems to lie in a very fine membranous duplicature, by means of which it is tied to the membrana tympani, and which fcrves it for a periofteum. The malleus is accompanied with blood vef- fels, which run in a radiated manner from the centre to the circumference of the membrane; but thefe are beft feen in the foetus. The periofteum of the tympanum, or barrel of the ear, produces that of the fmall bones; and it may be made vifi- ble by means of anatomical injections, which difcover capil- lary veflels very diftindtly ramified on the furface of the ofti- cula. It is likewife continued over the two feneftrae, and enters the Euftachian tube, where it is loft in the inner mem- brane of that duCt. The cellulae maftoidae are very irregular cavities in the fubftance of the maftoide apophyfis, which communicate with each other, and have a common opening towards the infide, and a little above the pofterior edge of the orbicular groove. 1 hefe cells are lined by a fine membrane, which is partly a continuation of the periofteum of the tympanum, and partly feems to be of a follicular ftruClure, like a kind of membrana

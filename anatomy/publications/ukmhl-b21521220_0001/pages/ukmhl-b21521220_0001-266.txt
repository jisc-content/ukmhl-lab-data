I Â«^4 LUNG Si fart Vf. # tontra&s again, by means of its elaftic membrane, as loon as that force is taken off. When we open lengthwife ary portion of the pulmonary artery and vein in the fame lung, we meet wi.h a great num- ber of tranfverfe rugae, which are d< ftroyed when thefe vef- feis are elongated, iHis is an obfervation made by M. Hel- vetius. In confluence of this ftru&ure, all the ramifications, both of the bronchia and pulmonary arteric? ancl veins, have con- flaritly the lan e tiire&ior, whether the lung be inflated or collapfed ; and they contract in length, without being either contorted or folded. 1 hele vcffels are elongated in exlpira- tion, and (hortened in inipiration. Thefe three veflels lie in a lort of cellular vagina, which accompany all their ramifications j and is a continuation of their interlobular cells, or cellular lubftance in the interftices of the lobuli. The pelliculi which compofe it are, however, there difpofed in a more regular manner, and more longitu- dinally, than in other places, and thereby appear to form a true vagina. When we blow through a pipe introduced fo far as to touch immediately a trunk of the blood vcffels or bronchia, the air runs at firft: through all the cells that lie neareft that trunk or its branches; but if we continue to blow, it infi- nuates itfelf through the whole interlobular fubftance. Bronchial glands. At the angle of the firft ramification of the trachea arter'n, we find on both the fore and back fides certain foft, roundifh, glandular bodies, of a bluifh or black- ifh colour, but reddifh in a child ; in fize they v,.ry from that of a field bean to that of a millet feed. Through thefe the lymphatic veficls of the lungs pafs in their way to the thoracic duff. The trachea has feveral coats, as has been already obferv- cd. The outermoft or common covering furrounds that part ef

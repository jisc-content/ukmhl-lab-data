Experience allures us that the urine Hows into the bladder in a continued ft ream : By flaying fome time in the biadd er, and from the absorption of the more watery part, the urine acquires an higher colour, and becomes lharper. We are not fully acquainted with the caufe which retains the urine in the bladder. The fphinckr is obfeure ; the fituation of the bladder lying on the refttim may probably contribute to the retention of the urine. ' Certain it is that the urine does not flow fpontaneoufly, even from a dead carcafe. .At length, by the-buik and acrimony of the urine irrita- ting thedenfible fabric of the bladder, it is thence expelled, partly by the motion of the diaphragm and abdominal mul- cles prefiing the inteftincs againft: the bladder, by .which means, efpecially in an ereCt pofture, the urine makes itlelf a way through the narrow and impeded paflage ; and partly by the perjflaltic motion of the bladder itlelf, ariling from the contraction of its mufeuhr fibres. By the urine, befides the particles of food and water, much matter that is noxious to the human body feems to pafs ofl, efpecially calcareous earth relorbed from the bones and folid parts, and which would not fail to produce bony crufts and calculi wherever it vCas flopped ; a fparry or gypfeous earth ; ai d an acrid oil mixed with lalt, fo as to afiume a volatile na- ture.

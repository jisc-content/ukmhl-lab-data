Chap. III. INTESTINUM JEJUNUM. 313 I dular tubercles, named after Brunner, which are nifed on the fides, and deprdTed in the middle by a kind of f-flul 1 j and they are more numerous near the beginning of this in- teftine than any where elfe. About the pylorus they lie as it were in heaps or clufters ; and from thence the diftance between them increafes gradually all the way to the other extremity where they are iingle. Thefe glands, when examined carefully, appear like little bladders, with the orifices turned towards the cavity of the inteftine, and the bodies fixed in the fponty fubftance next the nervous coat. They furnilh a particular fluid, which is often found to be vifcid., Ike biliary orifice of the duodenum. In the inner furface of the duodenum, almoft at the lower part of the fir(1: incurva- tion, and on the fhorteit fide, there is a longitu linal emi- nence, in the point or apex of which lies a particular open- ing, which is the orifice of the dudlus biliarius, within which the duffus pancreaticus likewife opens. This inteftine is commonly the wideft, though the fhort- eft, of the inteftina tenuia/and has been called by fome au- thors ventriculus fuccenturiatus; and is invefted with more cellular fubftance, efpeciaily while within its triangular cale, where it wants the outer coat which tiie others have ; and confequently it is more eafiiy dilatable by the fubtfances which might otherwife (lick within it. § 5. Intejlinum Jejunum. Situation and frze of the jejunum. The jejunum, fo called becaufe it is oftener found empty than the ileum, begins at the laft incurvation < f the duodenum, and is there connec- ted to the beginning of the inefocolcm. From thence it bends downward ‘rom left to right, and obliquely forward, or from the vertebrae, and makes feveral Vol. II. Rr convolutions.

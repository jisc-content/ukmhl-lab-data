Part VL THE BRAIN, 46 to the bro&d portion of the fuperior orbitary fiflure, where they are divided in the manner to be afterward defcribed. The fourth pair, called tiervi trochlearesy mufculares obliqui fuperiores, and moft commonly pathetici, are very fmall and tender, and, in proportion, very long. They arife each be- hind the teftes by one, and fometimes by two, fmall threads. From thence they take their courfe forward all the way to the edge of the anterior extremities of the tentorium, a little to the outer fide of the pofterior clinoid procefs, where on each fide they enter the duplicature of the dura mater, and advancing by the fide of the finus cavernofi, they accompany the third pair to the fuperior orbitary fiflure. The fifth pair, called nervi innominati, or trigemini, are at firft large trunks arifing by two fafciculi from the outer and fore part of the crura cerebelli, where they join the tuber annulare a little before the feventh pair. They run down obliquely forward on the extremity of the upper or anterior fide of the apophyfis petrofa, very near the fide of the fella fphenoidalis, where they enter the duplicature of the dura mater and finus cavernofi. At their entry into the finus, they form a kind of flat irre- gular ganglion, from which fome filaments are fent off to the dura mater ; and, immediately afterward, each of them is di- vided into three great branches, one fuperior or anterior, one middle, and one inferior or pofterior. The firft branch, which may be termed ocularis or ophthalmicus, accompanies the nerves of the third and fourth pairs through the foramen lacerum of the fphenoid bone. The fecond, called maxi/laris fuperior, goes out by the foramen rotundum; and the third, named tnaxi/laris inferior, by the foramen ovale of the fame bone. As the great trunk of this nerve runs down, it per- forates the membrana arachnoides, which at this place forms a kind of ceiling. The

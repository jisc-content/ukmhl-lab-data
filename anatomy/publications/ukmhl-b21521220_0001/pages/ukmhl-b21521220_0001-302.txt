3co VENTRICULUS. Part VI. opening is a continuation of the oefophagus; the other joins the intellinal canal, and is called by the name of pylorus The fiomach is not firuated in the left hypochondrium and epigaftric region, in the manner reprefented in mod of the figures It lies tranfverfely, obliquely, and almoll late- rally; in fuch a manner as that the great extremity, and the orifice next it, are on the left fide; and the fmall extremity, with its orifice, or the pylorus, on the right fide, and lower and more inclined than the former : Therefore we ought, with the antient anatomifis, to call one of thefe orifices fupe- rior, the other inferior. The great extremity of the fiomach is in the left hypo- ehondrium, and for the moft part immediately under the diaphragm: Yet the fuperior orifice is not in the left hypo- chondrium, but almofl oppofite to, and very near the middle of, the bodies of the lowed vertebrae of the back. The fmall extremity of the fiomach does not reach to the right hypochondnum It bends obliquely backwards toward the upper orifice; fo that the pylorus lies about two fingers breadth from the body of the vertebrae immediately under the fmall portion of the liver ; and conlequently lower down, and more forward, than the other orifice by almoll the fame dillance. This extremity of the fiomach has fometimes a particular dilatation on the fide next the great curvature. According to this natural firuation, the ftomach, efpecially when full, is fituated with its great curvature forward and a little downward, and its fmall curvature backward and a little upward. One of the lateral convex fides is turned upward, the other downward ; and not forward and backward, as they appear in dead bodies, where the inteflines do not fupport them in their natural fituation. If we divide the fiomach along the two curvatures into two equal parts, we fliall fee that the two orfices do not both adhere I

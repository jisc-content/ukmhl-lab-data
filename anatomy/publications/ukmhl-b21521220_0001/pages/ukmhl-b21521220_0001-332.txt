Part VL BLOOD-VESSELS. The 33® The venal ramifications form round the duodenum a net- work like that of the arteries-, and the lame kind of vafcu- lar texture is mere or leis to be found in all the other intef- tines. 1 ' The arteries of the jejunum come chiefly from the mefen- terica fuperior, and fome from the aicending branch of the n.efenterica inferior. The veins for the moff part open into the great meferaica ; and the reft go into the fplenica and final! meferaica or haemorrhoid.ilis interna. The principal lubaltcr.n trunks of thefe arteries and veins accom, any each other through the cellularLubffance between the laminae of the melentery; are diflributed by branches and ramK; and form the melhes, lozenges, and arches, which fhall be mentioned in the defeription of the arteries and veins. The laft of thefe arches and lozenges, or. thofe next to the intelline,1 produce two fmall vafcular planes, which fe- parate from each other very diftin&ly, and furround the in- teflinal canal in a reticular manner. The blood vefTels of the .feum have the fame fources with thofe of the jejunum; and it ought to be obferved concern- ing both thefe veflels, and thofe of the jejunum, that in t!»eir whole courfe through fhe mefentery, they give ramifications 1 to the glands, laminae, and cellular fubflance of the mefen- tery; and alfo, that there is a kind of communication be- tween leveral fmall meferaic veins and the capillary rami of the venae lumbares and fpermaticae. The arteries of the caecum and nppendicula vermiformis, are ramifications of the la(t branch from the convex fide of the melenterica fuperior; and they have likewife fome fmall ones from the iecond and third branches, when both are found. 1 he veins of thefe two parts are ramifications of the great meferaica ; and one of thefe rami is by Riolan termed •vaetia caeca [is > i ■*

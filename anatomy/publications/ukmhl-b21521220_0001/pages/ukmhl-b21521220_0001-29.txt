27 Cliap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. Fornix. The feptum luciduin is united, by its lower part, to the anterior portion of that particular medullary body, cal- led improperly the jornix with three pillars, becaufe of lome refemblance it is thought to bear to the arches of ancient vaults. It is, in reality, nothing but the corpus callolum ; the lower fid£ of which is like a hollow ceiling with three angles, one anterior, and two pofterior ; and three edges, two lateral, and one pofterior. The lateral edges are each ter- minated by a large femicylindrical border, like two arches, which uniting at the anterior angle, form by their union what is called the anterior pillar of the fornix; and, as they run backward feparately toward the two pofterior angles, they have then the name of the pferior pillars. The anterior pillar being double, is larger than either of the pofterior; and the marks of this duplicity always remain. Immediately below the bafts of this pillar, we obferve a large, white, fhort, medullary rope, ftretched tranfverfely between the two hemifpheres, and commonly called the anterior com- miffiire of the cerebrum. It is to this pillar that the feptum lucidum adheres. The pofterior pillars are bent downward, and continued through the lower portions of the ventricles all the way to their extremities, refembling a ram’s horn, which is a name that has been given to them. They gra- dually diminifh in thicknefs during this courfe; and at their outfides they have each a fmall, thin, flat, collateral border, to which the name of corpora fimbriata is applied. The pofterior pillars of the crura of the fornix unite with two medullary protuberances, called pedes hippocampi. The inferior furface of the triangular ceiling, which lies between thefe arches, is full of tranfverfe, prominent medullary lines ; fov which reafon the antients called it pfallpides and lyra, com- paring it to a ftringed inftrument, fomething like what is now called a dulcimer.

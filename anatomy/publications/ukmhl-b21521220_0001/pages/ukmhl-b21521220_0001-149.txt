The mufcle of the ftapes is fhort and thick, and lies con- cealed within the imall bony pyramid at the bottom of the 1 tympanum. It runs forward ro be inlerted in the neck of 1 the (tapes, on the fide of the longcti and molt crooked leg 1 of that bone. The three parts of the labyrinth, that is, the veftibulum, l femicircular canals, and cochlea, are lined by a fine periofr teum, which is continued over all the fides of their cavities, < and (huts the two fentlfrac of the tympanum. Upon this fine periofteum the vell'cls and nerves are difperfed. The f'emicire ular canals are Amply lined by a periofteum adhering to their inner luifaces without any particular mem- i branous bands. The t\yo half canals of the cochlea are lined i in this manner; the periofteum of the two fides of the bony 1 fpiral lamma advances beyond the edge of that lamina, and I forms a Jir embranous duplicature, which, extending to the 1 oppofite fide, completes the fpiral feptum. The feptum feparates the two half canals from the bafis to 1 the apex ; but there it leaves a little opening, by which the I Email extremities of the half canals communicate with each Other. The large extremity of the external half canal ends ! by an oblique turn in the feneftra rotunda, which is fliut by a continuation of the periofteum of that canal. The large : extremity of the other half canal opens into the veftibulum ; and thefe tWo extremities are entirely feparated by a continu- . ation of the periofteum. The whole internal cavity of the labyrinth is filled with a watery fluid fecreted from the veflels, which are difperfed up- on the periofteum. 1 his fluid tranfmits to the nerves the vibrations it receives from the membrane fituated between . fiie tympanum and labyrinth.

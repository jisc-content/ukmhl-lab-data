Chap. IV. 433 PENIS. t This ligament has been called ligamentum ehjlicum, becnufe it yields and recovers itfrlf and fu/ptnforium, becaufe it fu- fpends thefe parts, by means of its infection in the ly nphyfis. It fends off a deiachment or ala toward each tide, one edge of which is fixed between the mufculus triceps and the cor- pus cavernofum, and forms the ligament ary ex pa’ lion in which the dartos is inferted, as has been already (aid. It feems likewife to fend down another elongation diredtly to the perinaeum and anus. The fourth integument of thefe parts is the tunica cellulofa of Mr Ruyfch, which immediately furrounds the corpora ca- vernofa and urethra, lying between thefe and the third inte- gument, from which it feems to be diftinguifhed only by the clofenefs and finenefs of its texture ; and it is fometimes hardly perceivable. The mufcles. ■ Several mufcles are inferted in the parts which we have juft deferibed. They are fix in number ; two for the corpora cavernofa, two for the urethra, and two com- mon mufcles, called travfverfales. ‘(See Vol. I.) Blood vejfels. The arteries of thefe parts come chiefly from the iliacae internae or hypogaftricae, and the reft from the iliacae externa*: or crurale-:. The principal arteries are term- ed pudnae, of which one is external, the other internal. The pudica externa fends a branch to each fide, which ha- ving paffed out of the pelvis by the fide of the os i'acrum, runs on the infide of the trberculum ifehii,. to the roots of the corpora cavernofa, along the infide of the mufeuli llchio- cavernofi or eredtores. It fends ramifications to the bulbous, head of the urethra, and to the corpora cav. rnofa ; and, to- gether with the glutaeae, with which it communicates in its pafiage, it likewife fupplies the ferptum. The pudica interna having furnifhed the inteftinum rec- tum, bladder, veficulae feminales, and proftates, communi- cates with the hacmorrhoidales, pafles under the arch of the Vol. II. 3 I ofTa

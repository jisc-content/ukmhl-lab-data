But the two laft of thefe arguments are contradicted by ex- perience; and the firft can only impede or leffen, and not in- tercept, the flux into the heart: For the injections of air or mercury into all the letninal and biliary veflels, demonflrate that the large retrograde angles, which the veflels often make there, do not hinder the fluids from taking their natural courfe, though they retard them. But a proof, flill more evident, is, that the coronary artery beats at the fatne time with all the other arteries in the body, and the blood ftarting from it makes a higher faltus at the time when the heart is contracting. j y. Of the Nature of the Blood and Juices of the Human Body. The liquor which is contained in the arteries and their Correfponding veins, is known by the general name of blood i It appears homogeneous, is coagulable, and of a red colour ; it is redder in ItrOng and well fed animals, and generally yel- low in fuch as are weak and ftarved. White Breaks fome- times appear in it, in confequence of the chyle. But from various experiments it is certain, that this animal liquor con- tains very different ingredients. That fire is contained in the blood may be proved from if? heat, which, in human blood, and that of fomfi other ani. mals, is from 92 to ico degrees of Fahrenheitâ€™s, thermome- ter, which is more than the mean degree of atmofphericaL heat, but lefs than the greatelt. Dr Wrifberg lays, that daily experience Ihews that it differs in man, according to age, temperament, ftate of mind, motion or reft of body, climate, weather, kind of life, meat and drink, health, and the various fpecies and violence of difeafe. It is alfo certain that the .degrees of heat in the body increafes a little from an augmentation of heat in the atmofphcre; but it does not Voi. II. G g rife

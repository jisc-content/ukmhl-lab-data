AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. *7 5 The two ligaments which connect the epiglottis to the notch of the thyroid cartilage, and to the bafis of the os hyoides, and a third, which ties the balls of the os hyoides to the notch of the thyroides, form a triangular fpace filled with a cellular or fatty fubftance, and with ftnall glands. The epiglottis has likewife two lateral ligaments, by which it is connected to the arytenoides all the way to their points or cornua. It has alio a membranous ligament, which, run- ning along the middle of its anterior or concave fide, ties it to the root or bafis of the tongue. This ligament is only a duplicature of the membrane which covers the epiglottis, continued to the neighbouring parts. Laftly, there are two lateral membranous ligaments belonging to it, fixed near the glandular bodies called amygdalae. The epiglottis is not only perforated by the regular holes already mentioned, but has likewife a great number of fmall irregular fiffures and breaks, which are fo many different lacunae fituated between its two membranes, and filled with fmall glands, the excretory orifices of which are chiefly on the back-fide of this cartilage. Mufcles of tU larynx. The larynx gives infertion to a great number of mufcles, which may be divided into com- mon, proper, and collateral. The common mufcles, accor- ding to the general acceptation of that term, are all thofe that move the whole body of the larynx, one extremity of them being inferted in other parts ; and thefe are reckoned to be four in number, two for each fide, viz. fterno-thyroi- daei, thyro-hyoidaei or hyo-thyroidaei. The proper mufcles are thofe inferted wholly in the la- rynx, and which move the cartilages feparately. Thefe have, been divided in' various manners, but may be all reduced to the following pairs: Crico-thyroidaei ; crico-arytenoidaei la- terals ; crico-arytenoidaei pofieriores ; tbyro-arytenoidaei j arytenoidaei; thyro-epiglottici â€¢, aryteno-epiglottici.

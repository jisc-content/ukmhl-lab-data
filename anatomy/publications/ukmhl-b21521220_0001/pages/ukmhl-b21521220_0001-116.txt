THE EYE, 314 ' Part VI. and the diftance of diftincl vifion. Obje&s, by the means of this, inftrument, not only appear larger, but brighter and more diftinfc, and hence the mind thinks them nearer. The brightnefs of objects lituated in the fame light de- pends partly on the fize of this fame angle, partly on the number of rays which they reflect, and partly on the fmalt- nefs of the picture on the retina j hence near objects appear bright, while thofe that are more remote fecm oofcure; and hence alfo, ( when remote obje£ts are more enlightened, the mind iuppofes them either greater or nearer than they really are. The apparent place of an obj.-ct, feen with one eye, is in the line which divides the optical angle. Bur, if We look at an object with both eyes, its apparent place wiil be in the point where lines, drawn through the axes of both eyes to the objeft, meet. Dtjlar.cc we cannot perceive ; and if a blind man, who ne- ver faw, fhould by any means be reftored to fight, he would imagine every thing he faw to teuch his eyes Even we, who are accuftomed to judge by fight, make many fallacious conjectures concerning the diftance of objects. We judge of the diftance of an objeCt from the diminution of its known bulk; from its drminilhed brightnefs; from the faintnefs of its'image, by which we are lei’s capable of diflinguifbing its parts ; and, laftiy, from the number of bodies, whole dif* tan.es is known, that are interpofed between us and the ob- je£t. A body does not feem convex, until we have learnt by ex- perience, that a body, which is convex to the feeling, caufes light and lhadow to be difpoled in a certain manner. Hence it is, that microfcopes frequently pervert the judgment, by tranfpofing or changing the fhadows. The fame alfo hap- pens in that phenomenon which is not yet fufliciently under- stood, . 1 \ I

52 THE BRAIN, Part VF. the pia mater. The dura mater, both of the cerebrum and cerebellum, has arteries peculiar to itfelf, which have been already deferibed. The internal carotid on each fide enters the cranium by the great canalis petrofus, in an angular or winding courfc, as was obferved in the defeription of the fkelcton. The in-, ner furface of this canal is lined by a production common to the dura mater and inferior pericranium, to which the artery adheres only by a loofe filamentary fubftance, wherein the plexiform filaments, belonging to the great fympathetic nerve, run. Having pafi'ed through the bony canal, it immediately bends upward towards a notch in the fphenoidal bone, and through that notch it enters the cranium. Ia'imediately af- ter this it penetrates the cavernous finus on the fide of the fella turcica ; where having formed a third curvature, it goes out from it, from below upwards, and is bent a fourth time round the anterior clinoid apophyfis, from before back- ward. By this courfe, it is in a manner bathed in the blood of the cavernous finus, together with the fixth pair of nerves. After this fourth curvature, the internal carotid having now reached the fide of the infundibulum, and confequently being very near its fellow, thefe two arteries communicate femetimes by a very fhort tranfverfe arterial produ&ion. At this place, each of them, after fending a branch through the foramen opticum to the eye, divides into two principal branches, one anterior, the other pofterior ; and fometimes into three ; in which cafe there is a middle branch between the two former. The anterior branch runs, firfi: of all, forward under the bafis of the cerebrum, feparating a little from the fame branch of the other carotid. They approach each other again under M the interface between the two olfa&ory nerves, communica- ) ting : i

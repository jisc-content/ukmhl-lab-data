Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 71 it is refitted by no fenfitive torrent coining from the brain in a contrary direction. It is therefore probable, that the nervous fibres, and thofe of the medulla of the brain, which are of the fame nature, are hollow. The objections againft this doCtrine are fo few, and at the fame time fo frivolous, that they need not be men- tioned. If they are tubes, it is very probable that they have their humours from the arteries of the brain. There are many doubts concerning the nature of this ner- vous liquid. Several of the moderns will have it to be ex- tremely elaftiC, of an etherial or of an eledrical nature ; the ancients fuppofed it to be incompreflible and watery, but of a lymphatic or albuminous nature. Indeed, it is not to be denied that we have many arguments againft admitting either of thefe opinions. An ele&rical matter is doubtlefs very powerful, and fit for motion; but then it is not confineable within the nerves, fince it penetrates throughout the whole animal to which it is communicated, exerting its force upon the flefti and fat, as well as upon the nerves. In a living animal, the nerves only, or fuch parts as have nerves running through them, are affected by irritation ; and therefore this liquid mutt be of a nature that will make it flow through, and'be contained within, the narrow tubes of the nerves. And a ligature on the nerve takes away fenfe and motion, but cannot flop the motion of a torrent of ele&ricai mat- ter. A watery and albuminous matter is common to mod of the juices in the human body, and may therefore be readily granted to the juice of the nerves. The nervous fluid may probably be fimilar to the water exhaled into the ventricles of the brain ; and this opinion is ftrengthened by the flux of a gelatinous or lymphatic juice from the brain of fillies, and nerves of large animals, when cut. But, are thefe properties fufRcient to explain the wonderful force of convulfed nerves, obfervable

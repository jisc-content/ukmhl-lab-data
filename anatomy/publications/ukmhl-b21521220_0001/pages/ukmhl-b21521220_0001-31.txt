AND ITS APPENDAGES. the ventricles; and it is at the lower part of the interface, between the largeft portions of them, that we obferve the great eft tranfverle cord, named the anterior comtniffure of the cerebrunjy which we mentioned already in deferibing the an- terior pillar of the fornix callolus. This cord communicates more particularly with the bottom of the corpora ftriata, by a turn toward each tide. 2 halann net vorum opticorum. The thalami nervorum op- ticorum are lb named, becaule thefe nerves arile chiefly from them. i hey are two large eminences placed by the fide of each oilier, between the pofterior portions or extremities of the corpora ftriata. Their figure is liemilpheroidal and a lit- tle oval, and they are of a whitifli colour on the lurface ; but the^r inner fubftancc is partly grcyiih and partly white, lo that, in cutting them, we lee ftreaks of different colours like thole pi the corpora ftriata. Thele two eminences are clofely joined together; and at their convex part they are lo far united, as really to become one body, the whitifli outer fubitance being continued uni- formly ovtr them both. At ti.e bottom thele two eminences are elongated down- ward toward both fides, into two thick, round, whitifli cords, which leparate from each other like horns, by a large curva- ture ; and afterwards, by a fmall curvature turned forward in an oppofire direction to the former, .and reprelenting the tip of an horn, they approach each other again. The fize of thefe nerves diminifhes gradually from their origin to their interior re-union. We fliall have occafion to mention them more particularly in fpeaking of the optic nerves, Third ventricle. Immediately under the union or begin- ning of the thalami nervorum opticorum, lies a particular ca- vity called the third ventricle of the cerebrum. This cavity communicates at its upper and fore-part with the paffage be- tween the two lateral ventricles, and fends down from its un- der

Part VL 8(5 THE EYE, line capfula is thicker than the pofterior, and in a manner elaftic; and both its thicknefs and elalticity may be difcover- ed in difll'ffion, without any other artifice. The anterior portion fwells when macerated in water, and then appears to be made up of two pelliculae, united by a fine fpongy fublfance. “ I demonftrated this duplicature (fays Window) very plainly in the eye of an horfe by the knife alone ; and I even carried the reparation of the two laminae as far as the vitreous coat. Having made a fmall hole in the middle of the capfula of an ox's eye, and blown into it through a pipe, fome part of the air remained be- tween the edge of the cryftalline mafs and that of the cap- fula, in form of a tranfparent circle.” The aqueous humour is a very limpid fluid, refembling a kind of lympha or ferum, with a very fmall degree of viici- dity ; but, in the foetus and a fhort time after birih, it is of a reddifh colour '’See Petit, Memoirs for 1727). It ap- pears to come from the arteries of the iris. Window and others were of opinion, that it has no particular capfula like the cryftalline and vitreous humour ; but, from obfervations lately made in a memoir prefented to the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1 760, it appears that the inner fide of the cornea and anterior furface of the iris are covered with an exceed- ingly fine membrane, fuppofed to come from the choroid : Whether it goes into the pofterior chamber is doubtful The aqueous humour fills the fpace between the cornea and iris, that between the iris and the cryftalline, and the hole of the pupilla Thefe two fpaces are called the chambers of the aqueous humour, and they are diftinguilhed into the anterior and pofterior. The two chambers are not of the fame extent. The an- terior, which is vifible between the cornea and iris, is the largeft ; the other between the iris and crvfblline is very narrow, efpecially near the pupilla, where the iris almoft touches

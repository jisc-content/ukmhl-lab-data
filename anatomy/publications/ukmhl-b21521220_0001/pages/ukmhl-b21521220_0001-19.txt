>7 AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. C Vol. II. lateral finufes, the fecond and third of the antients.- The finus called torcular Hercphilt, the fourth of the antients; The fmall finus of the falx, or inferior longitudinal finus. The pofterior occipital finus, which is fometimes double. Four finus petrofi; two on each fide, one fuperior, and one inferior. Two tranfverfe occipital finufes. The circular finus of the fella fphenoidalis. Two finus cavernofi, one on each fide. Two orbitary finufes, one on each fide. All thefe finufes communicate with each other, and with the great lateral finufes, by which they difeharge themfelves into the internal jugular veins, which are only continuations of thefe lateral finufes. They likewife unload themfelves, partly into the vertebral, veins, which communicate with the fmali lateral or inferior occipital finufes; and partly into the external jugular veins, by the orbitary finufes, which com- municate with the venae angulares, frontales, nafales, maxil- lares, &c. as the lateral finufes likewife communicate with the venae occipitales, &cc. Thus the blood, which is carried to the dura mater, See. by the external and internal carotid, and by the vertebral arteries, is returned to the heart by the external and inter- nal jugular and vertebral veins ; fo that the blood, if ob- ftrufted in one place,_ finds, in confc-quence of thefe com- munications, a paffage.at another, though perhaps not with the fame eafe. This obfervation is of confequence, in rela- tion'not only to obftruftions, but to the different fituations of the head. The great finus of the falx reaches from the connection of the ethmoidal crifta with the os frontis, along the upper edge of the falx, all the way to the pofterior edge of the tranfverfe feptum, where it ends by a bifurcation in the great lateral finufes. It is very narrow at its anterior extremity, and from thence becomes gradually wider all the way to its pofterior extremity. The

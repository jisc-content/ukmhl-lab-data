AND ITS APPENDAGES. 7 3 Chap. I. which it joins in fucli a manner, as that the lateral laminae of the falx are continuous on each fide with the neighbour- ing portions of the fuperior lamina of the middle feptum. It is broader where it joins the middle feptum than at the os ethmoides; and it is thicker at that edge which adheres to the cranium than at the other, which lies loofe, and is very (harp ; and from this refemblance to a fcythe, it had the name of falx. The tranfverfe or middle feptum, called tentorium cerelelli, is fixed to the os occipitis, along the grooves of the lateral finufes, and thofe of the great angles of the apophyfes petro- fae, all the way to the pofterior clinoid apophyfes of the os fphenoidale. By this fituation it forms a fort of floor, tent, or {hallow vault, on the fore part of which is a large notch almofi of an oval figure. This feptum divides the cranium into two cavities, one large, or fuperior, and the other fmall, or inferior, which communicate together by the great oval notch. It is formed by a particular fold, and a very broad membrane of the in- ternal part of the dura mater; and, in the natural ftate, it is very tenfe, becaufe of its union, or rather continuity with the falx. This union or continuity of thefe two fepta keeps them both very tenfe, fo that the middle feptum is capable of fuf^ taining a confiderable weight without finking downward ; and the falx is able to refift lateral prefiures, without giving Way to the right or left fide. We may be convinced of this reciprocal tenfion, by firfi: touching thefe two fepta in their natural ftate; and again, after they have been cut one after the other, according to their breadth ; or rather after having cut in this manner the falx in one fubjcft, and the tranfverfe feptum in another ; For, as foon as the falx is cut, the other will be perceived immediately

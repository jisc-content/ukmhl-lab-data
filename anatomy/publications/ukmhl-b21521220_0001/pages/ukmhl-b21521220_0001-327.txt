Chap. III. MESENTERIUM, &c. 325 Near the extremity of this inteftine the rugae or folds be- come in a manner longitudinal; and at laft, towards the cir- cumference of the inner margin of the anus, they form little bags or femilunar lacunae, the openings of which are turned u; ward, toward the cavity of the inteftiue. Tnefe lacunae are fomething like thole of the lower extremity of the oefo- phagus, or upper orifice of the llomach. Mufcies of the anus. At length the extremity of the rec- tum contracts, and terminates by a narrow orifice called the anus, the tides ot which aredilpoled in clofe folds or gathers. This extremity ot the inteftine has feveral mufcies belonging to it, feme of which lurround it like fphinfters ; the reft are broad fl-ii.y p anes inlcrted in it, and which, being likewife fixed to other parts, iuftain it in its natural fituation, and re- ftore it to that fituation after being dillurbed by the force ne- cefiary for the exclufion of the faeces. Thefe latter mufcies are termed levatores ani; the lirft go by the general name of fph'inBers. bee defeription of Mufcies in Vol. I. ' 1 ij 10. Mefenierium et Me/ocolott. Divifton of the Mefentery, See. This great bundle of intef- tir.es is not left to move at random in the cavity of the abdo- men ; but artfully bound down by a membranous web, which prevents the intefhnal convolutions from being intangled in each other, and from being twifted or comprefied in all their different ways of meeting ; and yet allows them a gentle floating, but limited motion. This web goes ftill by the antient Greek name of mefentery, as being in fome meafure in the middle of ihe inteftines.

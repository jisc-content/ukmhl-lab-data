Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 123 the former, is termed lacrymal duEl; the one is merely a continuation of the other, without any valve, &.c. between them. The orbitary portion is difpofed at its upper extremity, much in the manner of an inteftinum caecum, and at the lower extremity is fomewhat narrower than the portio nafalis. Towards the internal angle of the eye, behind the tendon of the orbicular mufcle, it is perforated by a fmall lhort canal formed by the union of the lacrymal duffs. The nafal portion becomes gradually larger towards its un- der end, and having reached the lower part of the bony duff under the inferior concha is perforated by a round opening, which at firft fight appears oblong. If a tranfverfe line be drawn between the lower part of the pole and os malae, and another line be drawn direffly upward, oppofite to the third dens molaris, or oppofite to the fecond and third, thefe two lines will interfeff each other nearly at the lower extremity of this facculus. Sometimes the upper extremity of this bag has been found divided into an anterior and pofterior part, by a kind of val- vula connivens lying in the anterior portion, a little lower than the tendon of the mufculus orbicularis. The fmall common canal of the two lacrymal duffs opens in the pofter rior part of this facculus, and confequentiy behind the yalve. The fubftance of this facculus is fomething fpongy or cel- lulous, and thickifh, being ffrongly united by its convex fidp to the perioffeum of the bony canal, which may be very dif- tinffly {hewn. Sabatier obferves, that its fubftance is ftmilar to that of the membrana pituitaria, and that it is lined with the fame kind of mucous within. Its ufe has been compared, by fome late writers, to that of the bladder of urine, as was mentioned in the defcription of the eye. Duclus iiiciforii. The duftus inciforii, or nafo-palatini of gteno, are two canals which go from the bottom of the in- ' tem^l

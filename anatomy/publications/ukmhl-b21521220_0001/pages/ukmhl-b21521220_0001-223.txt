HEAR T. 221 Chap. II. looked upon as particular circulations. Such is the paffage of the blood through the liver, corpora cavernofa of the parts of generation, and through the cavernous finules of the dura mater. Nature hath given a heart to moft animals, even to many infefts and worms ; to others {he hath denied it; and thefe are the moll fimple of all .inimals, and are irritable through- out their whole body ; they are alfo fometimes very large, as we fee in many fpecies of the hydra. Thofe animals which have no hearts nave alfo no veflels. i he blood of the two venae cavae is propelled by a mufcu- lar force, in either vein, into the right auricle. Thefe veins, while they lie within the thorax, are endowed with llrong and irritable mufcular fibres, by whofe contradhon the blood is driven into the neighbouring auricle. In like manner, the auricle, being irritated, is contradled on all fides. Firfl, by a conl'tridlion of its nmlcular fibies, the anterior femicylinder of the auricle is reduced to a plane i while the fame fibres, by their contradlion, bring back the middle arch towards the anterior extremity or beginning of the heart, and likewife towards its poflerior extremity or fi- lms ; afterwards the appendix of the auricle defcends, and is contradled tranfverfely, while the lower part aicends ; and thus the auricle becomes fhorter : And, lafily, the left edge turns evidently to the right, and the right edge a little to the left ; and thus the auricle ,is rendered narrower. The blood of both cavae muft neceflarily, therefore, be driven through the open valves of the right ventricle of the heart: becaufe the blood is hindred from returning again into the lower cava, by the contra&ion of the auricle, by the refiftance of the fucceeding blood from the abdomen, and by means of the Eujlachian valve; and is hindered from afeending, both by the motion and weight of the confcquent blood. It is driven back,,

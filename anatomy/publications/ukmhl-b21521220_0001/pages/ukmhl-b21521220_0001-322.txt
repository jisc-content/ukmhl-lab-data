320 INTESTINUM COLON- Fart VI- raifed into confiderabie eminences. All the folds are dupli- catures, which form portions of valvulae conniventcs in the cavity of the inrcfline ; and the eminences form receptacles, called the cells of the colon. All the coats of the colon concur equally to the formation of thcfe duplicatures and cells, the depth of which decreafes gradually toward the extremity, of the inteftine, and neither of them go any further than the ligamentary bands. Thele portions of the colon which are immediately cover- ed by the ligamentary bands, are fmooth, and without rugae; and therefore, if thefe bands alone are cut acrofs, the intef- tine is not fufhciently elongated to deffroy ali the folds and cells. The common coat on one fide is a continuation of the me- focolon, and on the other fide it contributes, by the fame continuation, to form the omentum. The longitudinal fibres of the mufcular coat are very {lender, excepting in the bands already mentioned ; and thofe which anfwer to the annular or circular fibres of the fmall inteftines, are only fegments flretched over the eminences and folds. The other coats are nearly as in the caecum ; only the glandular lacunae or folitary glands are broader and more numerous. The arch of the colon begins under the right kidney, near the haunch. It runs up on the forefide of that kidney to which it is connected ; pafies under the veficula fellis, which tinges it with a yellow colour at that place ; and continues its courfe before the firif incurvation of the duodenum, to which it adheres, and partly hides it. In this part of its courle, therefore, there is a remarkable connexion between the colon, duodenum, right kidney, and veficula fellis. From thence the arch of the colon runs before the great convexity of the ftomach, and lometimes a little lower ; it then turn backward under the fpleen, in the left hypochon- drium; it runs down on the forefide of the left kidney, to v/hich

25* CIRCULATION Part Vf. where {hut up the whole cavity of the veins but where they do not lhut dole, they always intercept the greeted part of the tube. Another office of the valves in the veins feems to be for fuftainmg the weight of the blood, that its upper columns may not gravitate upon the lower ; nor the blood, flowing through the trunk-, make too great a refillance agair.ft that which follows it through the branches : For if, from the flower motion of the blood, its weight or preflure (hall, in any part, much exceed the impulfe that drives it on, fo as to caufe fome part of the column to defeend by its weight, it is, in that cafe, immediately catched, and fuftained in its relapfe by the next adj icent valve, which hinders it from urging again!!: the next lucceedirg column, and affords time and op- portunity for fome contiguous mufcle, by its preflure or con- cuffion, to propel the column. This is the reafon why valves are placed in the veins of the limbs and necks, in which parts they are both morq numerous and more robuft than elfc- where. This is alio the caufe of varices, when the blood, entering the hollow valves, urges thrir fblid convexity down- wards, and makes the vein dilate in that part. Likewife, in mufcuLr action, the valves are the caufe of the whole tffed of the preflure which the veins fuftain, forwarding the blood in its due courfe towards the heart. Moreover, the valves placed in the right fide jof the heart are fo conltructed, that they freely permit blood, air, or wax, to pafs from the venous trunks of the cava into the heart, but deny any reflux from t;\e heart into the veins. Again, ligatures, in a living per fan, make this circumftance more evident. When the veins of the limbs are tied, either by deflgn or accident, about the hams, arms, ancles, or wrifls, the limb below the ligature fwells, the veins fill and diliend thcmiclves, and, when opened, make a free difeharge of blood ; But at the fame time nothing of this kind happens above

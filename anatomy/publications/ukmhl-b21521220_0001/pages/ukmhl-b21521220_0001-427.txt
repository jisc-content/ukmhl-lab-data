425. Chap. IV. PENIS, This lateral union of the extremities, of the vas deferens, and veficu|a feminalis on each fide, forms likewife a kind of ihort feptum,. which terminates in a crefcent, like a fmall fe- niilunar valve; and the extremity of the vas deferens is narrower than that of the veficula. By this mechanifm, the fluid contained in each vas deferens has liberty to enter the contiguous veficula ; but that contained in the veficula can- not return into the other canal. If we blow into one of the vafa deferentia, after having compifefled the urethra, the air ii.fLtes the contiguous vefi- ' cula feminalis, and the bladder of urine, without puffing in- to the veficula er canal of the other fide, except we blow with two great violence. > Afterwards the two fmall tubes, formed each by the ex- tremities of the vas deferens and vefitula, run in between the bafis of the proftates and canal of the urethra â€¢, and perforat- ing the fides of that canal obliquely, they terminate in the caruncula, in the manner already faid. That of the right has no communication with that of the left. The veficula feminales receive their blood-vcffels from thofe which fupply the redum and bladder. 1 hey have lymphatic vefTels which carry off the thinneft part of the fe- men into the circulating fyflem. Projlatae. The firll portion of the urethra, or that which is not covered by the cavernous fubftance, and which, from the bladder to the bulb, is only a membranous canal, is fuf- tained by a large folid whitifh mafs, of the figure of a chef- nut, and fituated between the bladder and the bulb of the urethra; its bafis being toward the bladder, the apex or point' toward the urethra, and the fides lying upward and downward. This body is termed the prcjlates, from a Greek word that exprefles its fituation before the vcficulae feminales, and im- plies a plurality, becaufe it appears to be divided into two Vol.II. 3 H lateral

422 SPERMATIC VESSELS. Part VI. ture on both vertels a little above the tellicle, and another on the trunk of the vein, after he had emptied it, Then prefix- ing the aorta to force the blood into the fpermatic anerv, the vein which he had before emptied was found to be pre- fently tilled. From thence he concluded, that the couife of the blood to and from the terticle being obflru&ed by the inferior ligature, there muff be fome anaffomoles between the two ligatures, through which the vein muff be fupplied with blood. But it is very pl iin, that this efl'cdf was owing to the lateral rami- fications of the fpermatic artery and vein, and not to his pre- tended anaffom fes. Thefe fine lateral ramifications were well known to Euftachius, but had eicaped Leal- Lealis. Vafa deferentia. Tire vafa deferentia are two white folid flatted tubes ; one lying on the right fide, the other on the left. From the epidydimis, of which they are continuations, as has been already faid, each of them runs up in the cellular vagina of the fpermatic veflels, as high as the openings in the t abdominal mufcles ; the blood-vertels, lying forward, and the vas deferens behind them. f \ This fafciculus thus formed, by the blood-vefiels, vas defe- rens, and their common covering, is termed the fpermatic rope. The covering is fmoother on the outer than on the in- ner fide ; and for that reafon it has been confidered as a va- gina *, the internal fubftance of which is molfly cellular, and connedfs all the veffels together, while the external forms a covering to invert them. The vas deferens having reached the membranous lamina of the peritonaeum, where that lamina runs over the orifice of the vagina, feparates from the blood-veflels, and runs back- / ward, in form of an arch, in the cellular fubrtance of the pe- ritonaeum, as far as the neareft fide of the bladder. It partes afterwards behind the body of the bladder, to which it adheres very clofely, as alfo to the lamina of the peri-

Part VI. THE EYE, 91 ยง 7* Palpebrae and Membrana ConjunEliya. t Palpebrae. The palpebrae are a kind of veils or curtains placed tranfverfely above and below the anterior portion of the globe of the eye, and accordingly theie are two eye-lids to each eye, the one fuperior and the other interior. The fuperior is the largeft arid molt moveable in man. They both unite at each fide of the globe, and the places of their union are termed angles, one large and internal, which is next the nofe, the other fmail or extern.il, which is next the temples. Stn/dure of the palpebrae lhe palpebrae are made up of common and proper parts. ihe common parts are the ikin, epidermis, and membrana adipofa lhe proper parts are the jnufcles, the tarfi, the puncta or foramina lacrymalis, the membrana conjunctiva, the giandula lacrymalis, and the particular ligaments which iuttain the tarfi. The tarfi and their ligaments are in tome meulure the bafis of all thefe parts. Tarft. The tarfi are thin cartilages, forming the principal part of the edge ot eich pal pc bra, and tlaey are broader at the middle than at the extrcmi.ies. 'l'hote of the fuperior palpebrae are a little more than a quarter of an inch in breadth ; but in the lower paipemrae they are not above the fixth part of an inch, and their extremities next the temples are more {lender than thofe next the note. Thefe cartilages arc tuited to the borders and curvature of the eye-lids. The lower edge of the fuperior cartilage, and the upper edge of the inferior, terminate equally, and both may be termed the ciliary edges. The oppofite edge of the upper tarlus is fomething femicircular between its two extre- mities ; but that of the inferior tarfus is more uniform, and both are thinner than the ciliary edges. Their inner fides, or thofe next the globe, are grooved by leverai fmail tranfverfe channels.

DIGESTION. Part VI. 35* yet remain whole. The inteftinal water dilutes the little mafies of aliment •, and if any hard part remains, this liquor foftens it by maceration. The bile being intimately mixed with oil, renders it mifcible with water. What remains, after the chyle has been abftradfed, confifts of fome portion of the bile, become mucilaginous, and dege- nerated; fome part of the human mucilages; molt of the earthy parts of the food ; all thofe parts which, by their acrimony, were rejected by the abforbing mouths of the ladfeals, yet changed by means of putrefaction ; and laltly, all the folid fibres and membranes, whole cohefion was too great to be overcome by the maceration and periftaltic mo- tion in the inteftines. All thefe remains pafs from the extremity of the ileum int® the caecum, in which they are collected. The inteftinal feces, therefore, retained in the beginning of the colon or large inteftine, there grow dry by the abforp- tion of their vapours, fo as to be capable of receiving a figure from the round contradled parts of the colon ; they afcend from the bottom of the caecum elevated by the long liga- ments, which end in the appendix vermiformis. And here the manner in which the feces are propelled by the contrac- tion of the circular fibres, appears better than in the fmall inteftines. The longitudinal fibres of the inteftine, being attached to the contradled parts as fixed points, draw up and dilate the lower parts of the inteftine ; the parts of the in- teftine, to which the feces are next brought, being irritated and contradfed in like manner, are immediately after drawn together by the round and long fibres, by a fucceflive repeti- tion of which the feces finilh their courfe, through the whole large inteftine, in about twenty-four hours in a heal- thy perlon. While the grols feces afcend by the folds or valves of the ilium, the weight of them deprefics the lower fold to the left fide,

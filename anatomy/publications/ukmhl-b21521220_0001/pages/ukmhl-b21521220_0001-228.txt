When the blood, by the contraffion of the artery, returns towards the heart, it meets and enters the open concavities of the valves, which are by that means expanded, and the mouth of the artery is completely fhut. Any opening that might be left, is precluded by the finall callous bodies in the middle of the valves. The pulwonary veins, of which we fhall fay more hereafter, run into larger branches, which at lafl terminate in four (feldom two, and ftill more rarely five) trunks j to which it has been cuftomary to affix a name in the lingular, by calling them the pulmonary vein. 1 hel'e enter the cavity of the pe- ricardium, from whence they receive an external covering, and are then inferted into the corner* of the left or poiferior finus, which is fometimes likewife called the pulmonury firms. In this courfe the upper veins defeend, and the lower ones af'cend. That thefe veins bring their blood towards the heart, in the fame direction with the finus into which they open, is proved by a ligature, which caufes a turgelcence or fwel- ling, from the blood being retained, between the ligatur£ and the lungs. In this left finus the blood waits for the heart’s relaxation, when it is driven into the left ventricle, in the fame manner as the right auricle impelled its blood into the right ventricle. From what has been faid then, it appears that the fame blood is now arrived into the left ventricle of the heart, which was a little before fent from the venae cavae into the right auricle. This courfe of the blood, from one fide of the heart to the other, through the lungs, is called the pul- monary or lejfer circulation, and was known to many of the antients. It is proved by the increafed bulk of the pulmo- nary

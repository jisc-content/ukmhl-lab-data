Chap. r. AND ITS APPENDAGES. The occipital and frontal mufcles appear to be true digaP- trici, both in regard to their infertions and action. The fix- ed infertions of the occipitales at the lower part of the occi- put, and the moveable infertions of the frontales in the Ikin of the forehead and of the fupercilia, being well confidered, together with their reciprocal infertions in the fame aponeu- rofis, feem to be very convincing proofs that they are digaflric mufcles. Thefe four mufcles feem always to aÂ£l in concert, the oc- cipitales being only auxiliaries or affiftants to the frontales, the office of which is to raile the fupercilia by wrinkling the Ikin of the forehead ; thele wrinkles following the direction of the eye-brows regularly in fome fubjefls, and very irregu- larly in others. To be convinced of the co-operation of thefe four mufcles, we need only hold the hand on the occipitales, while we raife the eye-brows and wrinkle the forehead feveral times, and we ffiall perceive the occipitales to move each time, though not in the fame degree in all fubjedts. In fome perfons the occipitales feem to be relaxed, while the frontales being in contradlion move the whole fcalp and pericranium forward, and then contradt to bring them back to their natural fitu- ation. The adlion of the mufculi fuperciliares is to deprefs the eye-brows, to bring them clofe together, and to contradt the Ikin of the forehead immediately above the nofe into longi- tudinal and oblique wrinkles, and the Ikin which covers the root of the nofe into irregular tranfverfe wrinkles. This aflicn, as well as that of the frontales, and of the mufcles of the nofe and lips, is not always arbitrary, but fometimes me- chanical and involuntary. Thefe mufcles may perhaps like- wife ferve to keep the mufculi frontales in equilibrio during their inadhon, they being moveable by both extremities.

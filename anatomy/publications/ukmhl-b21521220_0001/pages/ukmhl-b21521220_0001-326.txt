RECTUM and ANUS. Part VI. 3-4 that fhall be afterwards explained ; and, having reached the os coccygis, it runs likewile in the direction cf that bone, and bends a little forward, terminating btyond the extremity of the coccyx. The fi ure of this intefiine varies according as it is full or empty. When empty, it is irregularly cylindrical, and links ill by a kind of tranfverfe folds ; and in that hate it is about three fingers breadth in diameter, more or lels. When full, it is wider in proportion to the quantity of faeces, wind, or whatever eife is contained in it ; and it may be extended to the fize of a large bladder, fo as to reprefent a kind of Romach. SttuEIure of the refltim. The membranous coat often con- tains a great quantity of fat, fpread between it and the muf- cular coat, and forming round the inteftine numerous emi- nences, in the room of the appendices adipofae of the colon, which fhall be explained in the hiflory of the omentum. The mufcular or flefliy coat is very thick ; and the longi- tudinal fibres, which in the other inteflines are very thin, are in tins ftrongerthan the circular fibres of the rdt. The ligamentary bands continue to incrcafe in breadth, and to ap- proach each other, as has been faid ; and it is to the flclhy fibres of thefe bands that the ttiicknefs of the longitudinal fibres leem to be owing. The nervous or filamen'ous and internal coats are larger here than in the other inteflines; and, when the redhim is empty, they form a great number of waving rugae in its cavity, which difappear in proportion as that cavity is filled. The lnnermcft coat is very improperly termed villofa, and fiercely deferves the name of papillaris, becaule of the fmalj- refs of the little rorpufclcs fpread on its furface. It contains a great number of fingle or folitary glands ; and it is always moifiened by a mucus of different confifiencies, difeharged by thefe glands or folliculi, and perhaps by the corpufcles alfo.

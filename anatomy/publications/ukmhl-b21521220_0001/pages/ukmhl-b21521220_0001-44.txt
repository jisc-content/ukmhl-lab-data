THE BRAIN, Part VI, 4? palling outwards, they go through the dura mater by two diftinft opening!; very near each other. Having penetrated the dura mater, the pofterior bundle forms a ganglion,' from the oppofite end of which the trunk comes out again, and is there joined by the anterior bundle. The dura mater which inverts the medulla, fends out on each fide the fame number of vaginae, as there are ganglious and nervous trunks. Thefe vaginae are produ&ions of the external lamina ; the internal lamina, which is very fmooth and polifhed on the infide, being perforated by two finall holes very near each other, where each vagina goes off-, through which holes the anterior and polterior fafciculi are tranfmitted, and, immediately after their paflage through the internal part, they unite. The triangular fpaces left between the anterior and pofte- rior fafciculi and the edge of the medulla, are filled from one extremity to the other by an indented ligament very thin and fhining, having the fame number of indentations as there arc pairs of fafciculi. It is clofely connected by numerous threads to the pia mater at each fide of the medulla, while the oppofite fide fends out indentations, the greater number of which run tranfverfely, though others go obliquely up- wards or downwards; and all of them, after being fplit into threads, are fixed to the inner fide of the dura mater. The under end of the ligamentum denticulatum, runs as far as the os coccygis, and is what authors have confidered as the fortieth pair of nerves *; from whence it fends filaments to the internal part of the dura mater, by which the anterior fafciculi are diftinguifhed from the pofterior. The membrana arachnokles is here very diftirtCl from the internal lamina of the pia mater : So that, by blpwing through a hole made in the arachnoides, it will fwell from one * For this and the three preceding paragraphs, fee Monro pn the Nervous Syftem, Tab.

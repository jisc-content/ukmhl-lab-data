Chap. I. *9 AND ITS APPENDAGES. veins being broader than the arteries, their two edges are feen on each fide of the arteries like capillary veflels. Thefe veins are, for the molt part, branches of the finufes, and the fmall trunks of fome of them open into the head of the vena jugularis interna. We may eafily be fatisfied that the arteries on both fides of the dura mater communicate with each other above the falx, either by inje&ing or blowing into them. The internal fraena of this great finus appear to be tendi- nous, and to be defigned to prevent the too great dilatation of the finus by the blood. They vary, however, in different fubjefls, and do not always reach from one fide to the other. It has been pretended, that glands have been found there ; but we ought to take care that fome fmall corpufcles, which feem to poffefs little or no glandular nature, are not miflaken. for glands. The inferior finus of the falx is fituated in the lower edge of its duplicature, being very narrow, and, as it were, flatted on both fides. It communicates immediately with the fourth finus of the ancients, and in fome fubjefts feems even to be a continuation of it. It likewife communicates with the great or fuperior finus by fmall veins, which go from one to the other, and with the veins of the cerebrum by the fame means. The lateral finuies reprefent two large branches of the fu- perior longitudinal finus, one going to the right hand, the other to the left, along the great circumference of the tranf- verfe feptum, ail the way to the bafis of the apophyfis petro- fa of the ofla temporum. From thence they run down, having firft taken a large turn, and then a fmall one *, and being ftrongly fixed in the lateral grooves of the bafis cranii, they follow its courfe all the way to the foramina lacera and foffulae of the jugular veins. They do not always rife by an equal bifurcation of the fu- perior longitudinal finus; for, in fome fubjefts, one of the lateral

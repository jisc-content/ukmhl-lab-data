T33 AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. The inner furface of the cutaneous tube is full of fine hairs, between Which lie the orifices of the ceruminous glands. The firfl: place in which we meet with thefe glands is on that part of the convex fide of the cutaneous tube which fupplies the breaks of the cartilaginous meatus. The arteries of the external ear come anteriorly from the arteria temporalis, and pofteriorjy from the occipitalis, both of which are branches of the external carotid. It is proper to obferve here, that the occipital artery communicates with the vertebralis, and thereby with the internal carotid. The veins are rami of the jugularis externa, and the occipital vein ; one of thefe rami communicates, not only with the vena vertebralis, but with the neighbouring lateral finus of the dura mater. The portio dura of the auditory nerve having palled out of the cranium through the foramen ftylo-maftoideum, in the manner that lhall be afterwards deferibed, gives off a ramus, which runs up behind the ear, to the backfide of which it fends feveral filaments; and the trunk of this ramus fends likewife filaments to the meatus and forefide of the ear. The fecond vertebral pair alfo fends a ramus to the ear, the rami- fications of which communicate with thofe of the other ramus from the portio dura. After having deferibed the external parts of the ear, we next proceed to examine its internal bony parts. And here we lhall confider them at fome length, as they are purpofely omitted in the ofleological part of this work. The bony part of the organ of hearing may be divided into four general parts : i. The meatus auditorius externus ; 2. The tympanum ; 3. The labyrinth ; 4. The meatus au- ditorius internus. It may likewife be divided into immove- able or containing parts, which take' in all the four already mentioned; and moveable or contained parts, which are four little

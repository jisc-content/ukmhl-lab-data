DIGESTION. 337 Chap. III. cum ; and from the neceflary vigour which require. A- nimaL food alone contains the gelatinous lymph ready pre- pared for the recruit both of our fluids and folids ; and this lymph, extracted from the broken veficls and fibres, ealily paffes in great abundance into the blood. An abmnence from animal food generally caufes great wcakneis both to the body and flomach, being perpetually attended with a trouble- iome diarrhoea. In the lize and length of toe inteiâ€™tina cral- fa, man agrees with herbivorous animals. Efculent vegetables are gehe*ally of the acefcent kind ; fome few of tjhem however are alkalelcenr or aromatic. Few of them have that animal glue wh ch is ipontantoufly change- able into blood ; for it is only the (mail portion ot jelly which, is drawn from their farinaceous parts, that, afer many re- peated circulations, is converted into the nature of our pro- per juices. The ufe of vegetables is extremely neceflary in order to prevent a too great quantity of blood, and to hinder its putrefcency. Too much animal food produces, ail we lee more particularly in Athropophagi, the hot alkalelcent (cur- vy, a fierce or favage temper, a peculiar fetor, and lepro- fy, with a lixivial corruption of all the juices ; which .ire only to be_cured by change of diet, in which a vegetable acidity abounds. Hence it is that we are furnilhed but with few canine teeth ; and that our appetite in health, but more efpdcially in difeale, is fironger for acidulous vegetables, in proportion to our warmer temperature of body, and greater heat of the country, or the feal'on of the year. Hence we fee, that, in the hotted climates, people live either altogether upon vegetables, or ufe fiefh meats bu; very rarely, and not without danger of acute difeafes ; while, in the colder coun- tries, flelh is eaten freely with lefs danger ; and hence bread, or a farinaceous aliment fimilar to it, is made a Handing part of our food throughout the world.

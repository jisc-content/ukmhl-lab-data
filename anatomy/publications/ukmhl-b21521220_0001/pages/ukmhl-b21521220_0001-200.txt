THORAX. Part VI. 198 External conformation of the thorax. The whole extent of the thorax in a living fubjeift is commonly determined, not only by the fternum, vertebrae of the back and ribs, but alfo by all that fpace contained between the articulations of the two arms with the fcapulae and claviculae; and in this fenfe the outfide of the thorax is broader above than below, in a healthy fubjeft, who has a moderate fihare of flefh on his bones. The breadth of the upper part of the breaft is owing to the petftorales majores and latiffimi dorfi viewed dire&ly forward or backward. But, when we take a dire& lateral view of the breaft, it appears narrower above than below, not only in an entire fubjedt, but even after every thing has been removed that covers the fides of the thorax, and in the lkeleton it- felf. 4 The common integuments of the thorax are the fame with thofe of the abdomen j and the convex fide of this part of the body is likewife covered by fevcral mufcles. Anteriorly, we find the pedtorales majores and minores, a large portion of the ferrati majores, the fubclavii, a portion of the fealeni and of the obliqui abdominis externi. Pofteriorly, we have all the mufcles which cover both fides of the fcapula, the ferrati poftici, and a part of the facro-lumbares, longifiimi dorfi, vertebrales. See. as in the hiftory of the mufcles. Among all the external parts of the thorax, only two are peculiar to it in the human body; namely, the two eminences called mam- mae, which muft therefore be deferibed in this chapter. Cavity of the thorax. The hard parts which form the fides of the cavity of the thorax, are, the twelve vertebrae of the back, all the ribs, and the fternum. The foft parts which complete the fides are, the membrane called pleura, which lines the cavity, and the mufeuli intercoftales, fterno-coftales, and diaphragma, already deferibed among the mufcles.

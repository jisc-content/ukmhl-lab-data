We fometimes obferve a confiderable veflel to go in or come out from the c< nvex furface of rhe kidney ; but this is rot common ; and in that cafe there is a depreflion, by which the proper membrane enter?, and communicates with that portion which goes in by the finus. The tunica adipola, or common coat, which likewife in- vefts the great veflels till their entry into the kidneys, does not feem to accompa y them any further, but terminates at the finu% in the intrritices between the ramifications. Si: uBure oj the ktdne\s. We may diflinguifh three kinds of fubttances in t i e kidney ; an exterior fubflance, which is thick, granulated, and in a manner cortical; a middle fub- flanc;, which is med Uary and ra dated, called Jlriaia^fulcata, or tubulans bee ulc it leems to be made up of radiated tubes ; and an inner lubltame, which is 6nly a continuation of the fecond, and terminates on the infide by papillae ; for which reafon it goes under the name of papillaris. Thcf- three fubftances may be feen diftincHy in a kidney cut i co 'wo equal parrs, through the great curvature. The cortical fubltance may be obferved round the whole circum- fen nee; and, by rhe microfcope, we perceive it to be of a fpÂ°' gv, granulated, and waving texture ; all its parts adhe- ring together in a radiated manner. Its colour is a bright whitifh grey. By fine anatomical injections and inflammations, we dis- cover an infinity of fmall capillary veflels, which run in va- rious dir Ctions between and round the different portions of x this fubllance ; and, by the help of a microfcope, we fee / likewife great numbers of fmall red corpufcles more or lefs found, and difpofed almoft like bunches of currants.

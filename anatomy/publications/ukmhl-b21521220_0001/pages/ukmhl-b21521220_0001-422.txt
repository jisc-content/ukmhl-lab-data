420 SPERMATIC VESSELS. Part VI. They run down obliquely in the polterior part of the ab- domen within the cellular fubftance of the peritonaeum, paf- ling infenfibly from behind forward j and fo parting gradual- ly more and more from the aorta, they crofs over the fore- fide of the ureters, and run through the openings or rings of the abdominal mulcles along with the elongations or produc- tions ot the cellular portion of the peritonaeum. They are fmall at their origin ; and, in their courfe down- ward, they give off very confiderable lateral ramifications to the membrana adipofa, peritonaeum, and alfo to the mefen- tery, where they feem to communicate with the mefenteric arteries. After producing numerous branches to thefe parts their fize is not diminifhed: fometimes, on the contrary, it is much increafed, owing feeiningly to the arteries, which are very long, and their coats thin, not being fufficiently able to refill the preffure of the blood. They fometimes pafs through the areolae or mefhes of the fpermatic veins ; and before they go out of the abdomen, they are divided into very fine rami, which run in a more or Ids winding courle, almolt parallel to each other. Afterwards they enter the celludr productions of the peri- tonaeum, which ferye them for vaginae. They do not fluc- tuate indifferently from one fide to the other of thefe vagi- nae; but are connected aloilg their inner furface by thin membranous laminae, which are likewife continuations of the cellular lubltance of the peritonaeum. The arteries continue the lame winding courfe within thefe vaginae, pafling before the vafa deferentia, which are likewife contained in the vaginae ; and at length they termi- nate by ramifications in the epidydimis and teftes, in the manner that fhall be afterwards explained. The fpermatic veins accompany the arteries, and have nearly the lame courfe. The right vein ends commonly in the- trunk of the vena cava, and fometimes it ends in the union

Chap. III. VENTRICULUS. 3®7 but very weak, and nowife fufficient for digeftion, without the affillance of the alternate motions of the diaphragm and mufcles of the abdomen. The pylorus, or flefliy circle of the inferior orifice of the ftomach, ferves to retain the aliments in it till they have ac- quired a luflicient degree of fluidity to pals ealily through that opening. But by a particular irritation or the mulcular coat of the ltomach, and Itill more by a violent contraction of the diaphragm and mulcles of the abJomen, the contents of the ltomach may be very foon forced towards the linall extremity, a. d pulhed through the pylorus. The gentle and alternate motions of the orbicular fibres of the mulcular coat may affift in fending through the pylorus, in the natural way, the aliment that is lufficiently digefled. This was called the perijlaltic or vermicular motion. by thole who believed that it is fucccflively reiterated, like that of earth-worms when they creep. Trituration might be a proper enough term for this opera- tion, provided it be made to figrufy only a gentle agitation or aiTion of the fie fhy fibres in a fubftance continually moiliened by the gaftric liquor, and not a violent grinding ot a dry fiub- flance. The fituation of the ftomach, which is nearly tranf/erfe, is iikewife of ufe in making the aliment remain long enough in that cavity; and may lerve to make the length of this, flay, in fome meafure, arbitrary, by means of the different pollures of the body ; lor, when we lie on the left fide, the aliment nuifl: remain longer than when we lie on the right, &c. The obliquity of the ftomach may ferve to clear up a diffi- culty that vrry much torments thole who believe that both orifices of the ftomach lie on the fame level ; which is, how any heavy fubltance, once got into the ftomach, can ever, rife ?gain to this level, to p?.fs into the intcftincs. \ f » b

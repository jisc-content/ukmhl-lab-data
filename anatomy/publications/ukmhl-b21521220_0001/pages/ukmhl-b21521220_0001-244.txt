Part Vl 242 -BLOOD and JUICES. the fluidity, and is not eafily raifed to fuch a degree as to co- agulate the humours Health, therefore, cannot fubfifl: wiihout a denfe and red blood ; and, if its quantity be too much diminifhcd, a flag- nation of the juices takes place, whence the whole body be- comes pale, cold, and weak. Nor can life or health fubfift without a fufflciency of thinner juices intermixed with the red blood; fince the cruor, deprived of its watery part, congeals and obflrutfls the fmalleft paffages of the veflels, and caufes too great a heat. It fliould leem that there ought to be a difference between the arterial and venous blood, on account of the former’s ha- ving lately fuffered the action of the lungs: But, in experi- ments, I fcarcely find any obfervable difference, either in co- lour, dcnfity, or any other property. Sometimes, however, .1 have found a mod: evident difference; for the bright colour of the arterial blood feems to dillinguifh it from the dufky dark coloured blood in the veins. The dark colour of the blood in a chicken, while in the egg, arifes only from the deep feat of the vein. But we have not fufficienr cer- • tainty of a difference in the blood of different arteries. However, the arterial blood is apparently of a more bright or fplendid red, and having a greater degree of fluidity and proportion of watery parts, may fo far differ from the venous darker coloured blood. But, to clear up this cir- -cumffance, farther experiments are requifite. From or.e and the fame mafl. of blood, driven into the a- orta, are generated all the fluids of the human body ; which, from their afffoity to one another, are reducible to certain claffes. The manner in which they are feparated ought to be accounted for by the fabric or mechanifm of the glands themfelves. But we muff firft confider what the blood fuf- fers from its containing veflels* “ The

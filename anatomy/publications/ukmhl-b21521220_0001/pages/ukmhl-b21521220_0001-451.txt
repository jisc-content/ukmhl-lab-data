The fpermatic v flels have nearly the fame origin in fe- males as in males, and likewile the fame cotirfe ami intrr- textures; but they never pais out of the abdomen, being wholly diftributed to the ovaria and tubes; and 'hey com- municate with the uterine hypogaftrics, and with the valcu- lar ropes of the ligamenta lata. The veins are very large in proportion to the arteries, and thefe vefTels fend out lateral ramifications which feem to communicate with the mefcraicae and vena portae. The vafcular ropes, commonly called the round ligament/, are two long fmall fafciculi of arteries, veins, and ligamen- tous fibres, interwoven and connected together by a fine cel- lular fubftance ; and they run in the great duplicature of the ligamenta lata, from each corner of the fundus uteri, as far as the annular openings of the abdominal mufcles. In this courfe, each rope thrufis outward or rnifes the an- terior lamina of the duplicature, which confequently gives a kind of coat to thefe vafcular fafciculi, and makes 'hem ap- pear like diftinft ropes connected to this forefide of the du- plicatures. > They feem to arife from the communication between the vafa fpermatica and hypogaftrica, and might be reckoned a particular continuation of the fpermatic velTcls. The dilpo- fition of their adhefions to the angle of the fundus uteri, with refpedl to that of the tubes and ligaments of the ovaria, which lie all near each other, is this: The tubes lie highefl, the ligaments of the ovaria moll backward, and the vafcular ropes forward, and a little lower than the ligaments of the ovaria. Afterwards they run in a courfe, nearly refembling that of the fpermatic veffels in males, pafs out of the abdomen,

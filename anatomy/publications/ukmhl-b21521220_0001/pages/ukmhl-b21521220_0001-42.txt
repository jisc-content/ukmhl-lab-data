Part VL 40 THE BRAIN, From this common portion of the cerebrum and cerebel- lum, arife almoft all the nerves which go out of the cranium, through the different foramina perforating its bale. It hke- wife produces the medulla fpinalis, which is no more than a common elongation of the cerebrum and cerebellum, and of their different lubftances ; and therefore the medulla oblon- gata may juftly be laid to be the firlt origin or primitive | fource of all the nerves which go out through the lpina dor- , and confequently of all the nerves of the human body. § 6» Medulla Spinalis. The medulla fpinalis is only an elongation of the extre- mity of the medulla oblongata ; and it has its name from its being contained in the bony canal of the fpina dorfi. It is confequently a continuation or common appendix of the ce- j rebrum and cerebellum, as well becaufe of the two lubltances of which it is compofed, as becaufe of the membranes by which it i6 inverted. In the defeription of the frefh bones, mention was made of a ligamentary fubrtance which lines the inner furface of this bony canal, from the great occipital foramen to the os facrum. Befides this, the dura mater, after it lias lined the whole internal furface of the cranium, goes out by the fora- men magnum occipitis, and forms a kind of funnel, in its progrefs downward, through the bony canal of the ver- tebrae. As it goes out at the occipital hole, it joins the be- ginning of the ligamentary funnel already mentioned, and adheres very ftrongly to it. That portion of the pericra- nium which terminates exteriorly at the edge of the great foramen, joins the funnel likewife, which, by all thefe accef- fions becomes very ftrong, and capable of refilling the great- eft violences.

VENTRICULUS. z°i Chap. III. On t e concave fide, it feems to be of a very loofe fpongy or filamentary texture, refembling fine cotton, as may be fecn by macerating it a little in clear water, which fwells it confider- ably in a very fliort fpace of time. It is fupported by a kind of ground-work of a very fine ligamentary or aponeurotic filaments which interfeift each other obliquely, much in the fame manner as the third coat of the inteftines ; of which hereafter ; and it adheres to the convex fide of the villous coat. The fourth coat of the ftomach has been termed by Fallow piu tunica villofa, becaule, when it fwims in clear water, fomething is feen in it like the pile of velvet. The antients called it tunica futigofa; and perhaps this name agrees beft with its true ftruifture. Thefe two coats are of a larger extent than the two for- mer, and they join in forming large rugae on the concave furface of the ftomach ; the greateft part of which is tranf- verfe, though irregular and waving. There are likewife fome longitudinal ones which interle£t the others-, but at the py- lorus they all become longitudinal, and terminate there. At the fuperior orifice of the ftomach, thefe rugae are in a manner radiated, and ftem to be a continuation of the pli- cae or folds of the oefophagus; only they are thicker; and where thele rugae and plicae meet, they form a fort of crown, which diftinguilhes the fuperior orifice of the ftomach from the inferior extremity of the oefophagus. In the interftices of thefe rugae there is often found a fort of {limy mucus, with which the whole cavity of the ftomach feems likewife to he moiftened This mucus, which is term- ed fuccus gajlricus or Jlomachicus, is much more fluid in living than in dead booies, and ha^ been fuppofed by Winfl >w, Le- ber, &.c to be fupplied by fmall glands fituated in the fub- ftance of the ftomach. But Morgagni and Haller have fel- dom feen fuch an appearance; and Sabatier oblerves, that, wheB

The epiglottis is an elaftic cartilage, fomewhat of the figure of the tongue, narrow and thick at the lower part, thin and {lightly rounded at the upper part, gently con* vex on the forefide, and concave on the backfide. It is fitu- ated above the anterior or convex portion of the cartilago thyroides â€¢, and its lower extremity is tied, by a fhort, broad, and very ftrong ligament, to the middle notch in the upper edge of that cartilage. It is perforated by a great number of finall holes, which are hid by the membranes that cover its two fides. Ligaments of the larynx. The cartilago thyroides is con- nected to the cricoides by feveral fhort ftrong ligaments, round the articulations of the two inferior cornua with the lateral articular furfaces of the cricoides. The apices of the fuperior cornua are fixed to the pofterior extremities of the great cornua of the os hyoides, by {lender round ligaments, about a quarter of an inch in length. In the middle of each of thefe ligaments, we often meet with a fmall cartilage of an oval figure, and much thicker than the ligaments. The thyroides is likewife connected to the os hyoides by a fhort, broad, ftrong ligament; one end of which is inferted in the fuperior notch of the cartilage, and the other in the lower edge of the bafis of the bone. It has alfo two ligaments at the middle of the concave fide which belong to the arytenoidaeae. The cricoides is tied to the lower part of the thyroides by a ftrong ligament; and by the ligaments already mentioned, to the inferior cornua of that cartilage. Its bafis is fixed to the firft cartilaginous ring of the trachea arteria, by a liga- ment exactly like thofe by which the other rings are con- nected together; and the membranous or pofterior portion of the

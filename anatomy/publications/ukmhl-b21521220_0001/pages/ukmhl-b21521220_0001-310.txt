3«8 Part VI. INTESTINES. § 3. The intefines in general. 4 Situation, fixe* and divifon of the inti fines. Between the pylorus and the very lowcft part of the abdomen lies a long canal, bent in a great many different directions by numerous convolutions or turnings, calhd the intf ines. This canal, thus folded and turned, forms a confiderabls bulk, which fills the greateft part of the cavity of the abdo- men ; and it i- connected through the whole extent to mem- branous productions or continuations of the peritonaeum, principally to thofe called the mefentery and mefocolon; of •which hereafter. ' The incurvations of the inteflinal canal form two arches; a fmall one, by which it is connected to the mefentery and mefocolon ; and a great one on the oppolhe fide, which lies loofe. The whole canal is generally about fix or leven times as long as the fubjeCt. The inteflinal canal is neither of an equal fize nor thick- nefs through its whole length \ from whence anatomifts have taken occafion to confiJer its different portions as fo many particular inteftines, and to divide them all into fmall and great. And as they ftill found fome differences in each clafs taken altogether, they divided each into three portions, which they diftinguilhed by particular names. In the fmall inteftines, the three portions arc named duodenum jejunum, and ileum ; and in the great inteftine'., caecum, colon, and rectum. StruHure of the inteflines. The inteftines in general are compoled of feveral coats, much in the lame manner with the llomach The firft and ourermoft is a continuation of the mefentery, or of fome other elongation or duplicature of the peritonaeum.

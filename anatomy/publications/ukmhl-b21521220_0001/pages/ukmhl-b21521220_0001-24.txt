Part VI* "it THE BRAIN. Structure. It is compofed of two laminae, of which the external one is named, tunica arachnoidea, from its refemblance to a cobweb. They adhere clofely to each other at the up- per part of the brain j but are eafily feparable at the bafis, and through the whole length of the fpinal marrow. The tunica arachnoidea is a remarkable thin and tranfpa- rent membrane, having no veffels, that can be injected, enter- ing into its compofition. It is fpread uniformly over the fur- face of the brain, inclofing all the circumvolutions, but with- out entering in between any of them ; while the pia mater forms a great number of plicae, duplicatures, and fepta, which not enly cover the brain in general, but infinuate themfelves into all the folds and circumvolutions, and between the different ftrata of the cerebrum and cerebellum, and are lilgewife continued into the different cavities. The two laminae of the pia mater are connected by a cel- lular fubftance, which accompanies them through their whole extent, except at fotne places of the bafis of the cerebrum, &x. where, the internal lamina continuing its infections, the external remains uniformly ftretched over the prominent parts, the interftices of which are entirely feparated from the other lamina, without any cellular fubftance between them. Thefe feparate portions of the external lamina have made it be looked upon as a third membrane of the brain, diftinfl from the pia mater. J 3. Cerebrum. Situation and figure. The cerebrum, properly fo called, is a kind of medullary mafs, of a moderate confidence, and of a greyifh colour on the outer furface, filling all the fuperior portion of the cavity of the cranium, or that portion which lies above the tranfverfe feptuin. The upper part of the ce- rebrum is of an oval figure, like half an egg cut lengthwife. or

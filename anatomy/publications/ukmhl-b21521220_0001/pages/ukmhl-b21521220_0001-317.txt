Chap. III. INTESTINUM JEJUNUM. 3 perfectly to the membranous coat, and to the longitudinal fibres of the mufcular, which are here more vifible, and ap- pear to be ftronger than in any other place. The tunica ncrvofa, which we choofe rather to call reticu- laris, and its proper cellular or lanuginous fubftance, have nothing peculiar to them more than has been already fait! about the inteftines in general. By blowing artfully into this Jubilance, it may be made to fwell fo much, round the whole cavity of tho inteflines, as to dellroy all the duplicatures or yalvulae conniventes. Thefe valves in this intefline are very broad, very nume- rous, and very near each other. On the fide of the great curvature, their circumference is continuous and uniform ; but next the fmall curvature, there are fcveral breaks in them, the extremities of fome advancing beyond the red, and ter- minating in points. Some of thefe valves go quire round, others only fonte part of the way ; and Jome of them are very final], which go obliquely between two large ones^ forming a kind of communication. The papillae of the tunica villofa are here more railed, loofe, and floating than in the duodenum ; and each of them feerns to be divided into feveral others, by incifures of a very lingular kind. In other refpefts they nearly agree with what was faid in the defeription of the inteflines in general. The obfervations and figures publifhed by M. Helvetius, fir ft phy- fician to the French Queen, in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy, exprefs theie papiliue, and the whole tunica reti- cularis, very jufily. The glandular lacunae of the jejunum are of the fame ftru'ifture with the glandulae Brunneri or duodenaies ; but they are dlfpofed in a different manner. They are partly Angle, at different difiances from each other ; and p.irrlv in feveral clufiers, like flat oblong bunches of grapes, called plexus glanduloft Pcjeri. Thefe are in the largefi quantity nca?

120 THE NOSE, Part VI. ing mufcles, which, in many cafes, become affiftants to the proper mufcles of this organ. The firft pair of thefe mufcles raifes and dilates the alae of the nares when they adt. They likewife wrinkle the {kin on the tides of the nofe. The fecond pair have the contrary effedt; and the third pair comprefs the tides of the nofe to the feptum, as in fmelling. Membrana pituitaria. The membrana pituitaria is that which lines the whole internal nares, the otfa fpongiofa, the tides of the feptum narium, and, by an uninterrupted continu- ation, the inner furface of the tinus frontales and maxillares, and of the dudtus lacrymales, palatini, and fphenoidales. It is likewife continued down from the nares to the pharynx, feptum palati, Euftachian tubes, &.c. as we fliall {hew here- after. It is likewife known by the name of Schneideriana, from the anatomift who has given a defcription of it. It is termed pituitaria, becaufe through the greateft part of its large extent, it ferves to feparate from the arterial blood a mucilaginous lymph, called pituita by the antients, which, in its natural ftate, is nearly liquid ; but it is fubjedl to very great changes, becoming fometimes glutinous or fnotty, fome- times limpid, &c. *, neither is it feparated in equal quantities through the whole membrane. When we carefully examine this membrane, it appears to be of a different flrudture in different parts. Near the edge of the external nares it is very thin, appearing to be the fkin and epidermis in a degenerated ftate. All the other parts of it, in general, are fpongy, and of different thickneffes. The thickeft parts are thofe on the feptum narium, on the whole lower portion of the internal nares, and on the conchae ; and, if we make a fmall hole in it at any of thefe places, and then blow through a pipe, we difeover a very large cellular fubftance. In the finufes it appears to be of a more {lender texture. Winflow

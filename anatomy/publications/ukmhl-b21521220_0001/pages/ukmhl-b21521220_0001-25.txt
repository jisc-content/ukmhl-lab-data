23 AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. or rather like two quarters of an egg cut lengthwife, and part- ed a little from each other. It is flatter on the lower part, each lateral half of which is divided into three eminences, which correfpond with the cavities at the bafe of the cra- nium. Divifton and lobes. The cerebrum is divided into two late- ral portions, feparated by the falx, or great longitudinal fep- tum of the dura mater. They are generally termed hemi- fpheres, but they are more like quarters of an oblong fpheroid. Each of thefe portions is divided into two extremities, one anterior, and one pofterior, which are termed the lobes of the cerebrum, between which tf&re is a large inferior protube- rance which goes by the fame name ; fo that in each hemi- fphere there are three lobes, one anterior, one middle, and one pofterior. The anterior lobes lie upon thofc parts of the os frontis which contribute to the formation of the orbits and of the frontal iinufes, commonly called the anterior fojjfae of the bafts cranii. The middle lobes lie in the middle or latteral foflae of the bafis cranii; and the pofterior lobes cn the tranfverfe fepturn of the dura mater. The anterior and middle lobes of the cerebrum, on each fide, are parted by a deep narrow ful- cus, which afcends obliquely backward, from the temporal ala of the os fphenoides to near the middle of the os parie- tale; and the two fides of this divifion have each their parti- cular ridges and convolutions, which gives a very great ex- tent to the cortical fubftance. This fulcus is termed fjfura inagna Sylvii, or Amply fjfura cerebri. Sides and inequalities. Each lateral portion of the cerebrum has three fides; one fuperior, which is convex; one inferior, which is uneven ; and one lateral, which is flat, and turned to the falx. Through the whole furface of thefe three fides we fee inequalities or windings, like the circumvolutions of mteftines, formed by weaving ftreaks or furrows, very deep itnd

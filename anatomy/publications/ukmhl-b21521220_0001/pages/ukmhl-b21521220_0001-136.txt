I 134 THE EAR, part VI. little bones lodged in the tympanum, called incus, malleus, Jlapes, and os orbiculare or lenticulare. The external auditory paftage begins by the external audi- tory hole, the edge of which is rough and promiuent; but, backward toward the maftoid proceis, it appears very much Hoped. The paflage itfelf is fomewhat more than half an inch in length, running obliquely from behind forward in a curved dire&ion. Its cavity is almoft oval, but wider at each end than in the middle. It terminates inwardly by an even circular edge, lying in a plane very much inclined, the upper part of it being turned outward, and the inner part inward; fo that the canal is longer on the lower than upper fide. The circular edge is grooved quite round for the attachment of the membrana tympani. In children, this bony canal is wanting, as well as the maf- toid procefs ; and the inner circular edge is a diftinft ring, which, in an advanced age, unites entirely, and becomes one piece with the reft. It is termed the bony circle in infants ; and indeed it is very eafily feparated from all the other parts- It would feem, therefore, that the whole bony canal in adults is only a prolongation of the bony circle in children ; becaufe, even in a more advanced age, the whole canal may without much difficulty be taken out. The circular groove lies between the maftoid procefs and the articular fiflure mentioned in the defcription of the other parts of the tem- poral bone. Tympanum. The tympanum, or drum of the ear, is a ca- vity fomewhat fpherical, or rather hemifpherical, the bottom of it being turned inward, and the mouth joined to the cir- cular groove already mentioned. The remarkable eminences are three : A large tuberofity, lying in the very bottom of the tympanum, a little toward the back part; and a fmall irregular pyramid, fituated above the tuberofity, and a little more backward; its apex is per- forated

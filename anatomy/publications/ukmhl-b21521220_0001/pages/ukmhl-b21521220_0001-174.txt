173 THE MOUTH, Part Vt horizontal when we ftand; and to this the afpera arteria is connected ; fo that the cricoides may be looked upon as the upper extremity of the rrachea. The pofterior portion of the cricoides is larger than the reft and its posterior or convex fide is divided by a longitu- dinal eminence, or prominent line, into two diltindt furfaces, for the in/ertion of mufcles. The top is gently Hoped above this prominent line ; and terminates on each fide by a kind of obtufe angle, formed between it and the oblique edge of each'lateral portion of this cartilage. At the upper part of each of thel'e angles, there is a very fmooth articular furface, gently convex. The whole pofterior fide is diftinguifhed into two lateral portions by two prominent lines, each of which runs down almoft in a ftraight direction from the articular furface at the top, a little below the middle of this fide, where it terminates jn another articular line a little concave â€¢, and near thefe four articular furfaces there are fmail tubercles. The two fuperior furfaces are for the articulation of the cartilagines arytenoi- daeae, and the two inferior for the articulation of the inferior cornua or appendices of the cartilago thyroides. Cartilagines arytetioidaeae. The cartilagines arytenoidaeae are two finall, equal, fimilar cartilages, which, joined toge- ther, refemble the fpout of an ewer *, and they are fituated on the top of the cricoides. In each, we may confider the bafis; cornua j two tides, one pofterior and concave, the other anterior and convex*, and two edges, one internal, the other external, which is very oblique. The bates are broad and thick ; and have each a concave articular furface, by which they are joined to the cricoides. The cornua are bent backward, and a little toward edch other. In fome fubjefts they are very loofe, appearing like true appendices, and eafily feparable from the reft. Between their

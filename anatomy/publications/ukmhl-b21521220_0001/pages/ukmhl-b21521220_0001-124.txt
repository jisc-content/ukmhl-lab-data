112 Part VL THE NOSE, Backward, above the tuberofity of the os maxillare, the tides of the finus are very thin, efpecially at the place which lies before the root of the apophyfes pterygoides. Inward, or toward the conchae narium, the bony part of the finus is likewife very thin. Sacculus lacrymalis. The lacrymal facculus is an oblong membranous bag, into which the ferous fluid is difcharged from the eye, through the puncta lacrymalia already defcrl- bed, and from which the fame fluid pafles to the lower part of the internal nares. It is fituated in a bony groove and canal, formed partly by the apophylis nafalis of the os maxil- lare and os unguis, partly by the fame ds maxillare and lower part of the os unguis, and partly by this lower portion of the os unguis, and a fmall fuperior portion of the conchae na- rium inferior. This groove and canal are the bony lacrymal dudf, about which beginners fliould confult what was faid hi the defcription of the fkeleton. With refpeft to the fituation of this bony duft. It runs down for a little way obliquely backward, toward the lower and lateral part of the internal nares on each fide, where its lower extremity opens on one fide of the finus maxillaris under the os fpongiofum inferius, nearly at the place from which a perpendicular line would fall in the interftice be- tween the fecond and third dens molaris. The upper part of this dudt is only an half-canal or groove; the lower is a complete canal, narrower than the former. The facculus lacrymalis may be divided into a fuperior or orbitary portion, and an inferior or nafal portion. The orbitary portion fills the whole bony groove, being fituated immediately behind the middle tendon of the mufculus or- bicularis. About one fourth of its length is above this ten- don, and the reft below ; the upper part is the lacrymal fac properly To called ; while the nafal portion, which lies in the bony canal of the nole, being narrower and fhorter than the

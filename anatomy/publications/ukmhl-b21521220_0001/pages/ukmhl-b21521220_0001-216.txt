HEART. 214 Fart Vr, divided into two parts ; and, from fome fmall refemblance to a mitre, has been named mitralis. That which is next the mouth of the aorta is the Iargeft. The femilunar valves are fix in number, three belonging to each ventricle, fituated at the mouths of the great arteries; and they may be properly enough named valvulae arteriales. Their concave fides are turned toward the cavity of the arte- ries, and their convex fides approach each other. In exami- ning them with a microfcope, we find flefhy fibres lying- in the duplicatur^ of the membranes of which they are com- pofed. • They are truly femilunar, or in form of a crefcent, on that fide by which they adhere; but their loofe edges are of a dif- ferent figure, each cf them reprefenting two fmall crefcents ; the two extremities of which meet at the middle of this edge, and there form a kind of fmall papilla, firft deferibed by Arantius, and afterwards by Morgagni, and therefore named- from them. The aorta in general. The great artery that goes out from the left ventricle, is termed aorta. As it goes out, it turns a little toward the right, and then bends obliquely back- ward, to form what is called aorta defeendem ; which we fhall have occafion to mention again hereafter. At the be- I ginning of the aorta, and behind the femilunar valves, three elevations are obferved on the outfide: Thefe correfpond to an equal number of pits on the infide, which, from the dif- coverer, have been called fmufes of Val/alva. Their ule is nor well known. From about the middle of the convex fide of this curvature three great branches arife, which furnifh an infinite number of ramifications to the head and upper ex- tremities of the body ; as the defeending aorta does in the fame manner to the thorax, abdomen, and lower extremities. The nr term pttlmonaris in general. The trunk of the ar- tery which goes out from the right ventricle is called arteria « pultnonari;.

323 RECTUM and ANUS. Chap. III. dried preparations of this part give a very falfe idea of its ftructure and conformation; and the fame thing is to be laid Gf the opening of the appendicula vermiformis into the cae- cum. The capacious arch of the colon is conneffed by both ex- tremities to the regio lumbaris, near the kidneys, by two par- ticular ligaments, one on the right fide, the other on the lefr, which are only fmall duplicatures of the peritonaeum, more or lels tranfverfe. The remaining portion, which forms the two convolu- tions in form of the Roman S, contraffs below the left kidney, being narrower there than lower down The coats of this portion become* gradually thicker and ftronger, and likewile the ligamentary bands, which approach each other by degrees, and leem to increafe in breadth. , The veffels, nerves, &.c. will be found in the defeription of the melentery. ยง 9. Intejiinum Rectum, and Anus. Situation, figure, and fze of the rehlum. The la ft of all the inteftines is named rectum, or the tlraight gut, from its fituation ; for, \t>hen viewed direfily forward, it appears to run down in a firaight courle from the laft vertebra of the loins, oil the forefide of the os facrum, all the way to the os coccygis, where it ends in what is called the anus. This intefline, properly fptaking, is a true continuation of the laft convolution of the colon ; and it is the repofltory, fink, and common fewer, of the whole inteftinal canal. It has likewife a fpecial relation to the bladder, and to the parts of generation in both fexes. The reflum having pafted below the laft vertebra of the loins, to the infide of the os facrum, is bent backward, on that concave fide to which it is connefled, in the manner that

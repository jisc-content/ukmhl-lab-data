But the nature or difpofition of the covering with which the papillae are clothed, together with that of the juices, and of the aliments lodged in the ftomach, have a confiderable fhare in determining the fenfe of tafte ; inlomuch, that the fame flavour does not equally pleafe or affeift: the organ in all ages alike, nor in perfons of all temperaments ; nor even in the fame perfon at different times, and in different ftates of health or difeafe. In general, whatever contains lefs fait than the faliva itfelf, feems infipid. , The fpirituous parts, more efpecially of vegetables, either penetrate into the papillae themfelves, or elfe are abforbed by the adjacent villi of the tongue *, as appears from the fpeedy reftitution of the ftrength by vinous, or aromatic liquors. For this reftitution takes place even before they are received into the ftomach. Nature defigned the difference of taftes to be felt by the tongue, that we might know and diftinguifh fuch foods as are moft falutary ; for, in general, there is not any one kind of wholefome aliment that is of a difagreeable taftej nor are there any ill tailed fubftances that are fit for our nourifh- ment. By excefs, indeed, the moft wholefome food becomes prejudicial. Nature has invited us to take neceffary food, as well by the pain called hunger, as by the pleafure arifing from the fenfe of tafte. But brute animals, who have not, like us, the advantage of learning from each other by in- ftruflion, have the faculty of diftinguifhing flavours more accurately, by which they are admonifbed cautioufly to avoid poifonous or unwholefome food; and therefore it is that, in herbivorous cattle, to which a great diverfity of noxious plants is offered among their food, the tongue is of a more Vol. II.

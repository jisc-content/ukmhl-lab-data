75 AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. feems to have provided, that, in whatever part of the brain any injury may happen, the nerve thence arifing is not always deprived of its ule. For, if the nerve receives its fibres by communicating bundles, as well from the oppofite as from its own hemifphere of the brain, its office may in fome mea- fure be continued entire by the fibres which it receives from the oppofite fide, even after thofe of its own fide are dellroy- ed.

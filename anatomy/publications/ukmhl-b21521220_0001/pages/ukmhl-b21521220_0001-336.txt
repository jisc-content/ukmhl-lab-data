Part VL DIGESTION. 3S4 acrimonious putrefcency, by the evaporation of its thin watery parts ; and this evaporation being incrcafed by the heat of the body, and the motion of the heart and arteries, nature calls drcuuoufly fora recruit of the watery element, by which the cohefive globules of the blood are feparated from each other, and hindered from running together into a folid mafs. ,1 Thefe truths are proved, not only from their caufes, but likewile by the appearances which they exhibit in men and other animals ftarvcd to death. For, in fuch, we commonly obferve the breath fharp and fetid, the teeth loofened by the difiblving acrimony of the juices, violent pains in the do- mach acute fevers, and even madnefs. All thefe dilorders arife fooner and ftronger, as the perfon is more robuft and more accullomed lo exercdc ; but they enfue very flowly in phlegmatic people, who are unaÂ£tive, perfpire little, and put the blood into no great motion. Laftly, thole who have li- ved fome time without food and bodily exercife have, for the mod part, laboured under a difeafe of the nerves. The frelh chyle, prepared, for the mod part, from acelccnt vegetable food, is of a confidence always thin- ner than that of the blood itlelf; being received into the circulation, it temperates the putrefcent acrimony, di- lutes the threatened coagulation, and reduces the whole mafs to that moderate degree of faline nature which is natu- ral to man j And finally, the chyle, but more elpecially that derived from animal food, and likewife what is formed of farinaceous vegetables, being replenillied with gelatinous lymph, ferves to repair the confumption or wade which is made from the body itfelf, to the vacuities of whofe broken folids it is applied by the caufes which promote the growth of the body. The drink dilutes the cohefive diathefis of the blood, hinders its putrefa&ion, and carries off by the emunc- tories luch particles as are already putrid And hence it is that

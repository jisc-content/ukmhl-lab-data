By this we may difiinguifh the incus of one ear from that of the other, when out of their places : For, turning the fliort leg backward, and the long leg down- ward, if the curvature of this long leg be toward the left hand, the bone belongs to the right ear 5 if toward the right, it belongs to the left ear. Malleus. The malleus, or hammer, is a long bone, with a large head, a fmall neck, an handle, and two procefles ; one in the neck, the other in the handle. The top of the head is confiderably rounded ; and from thence it contracts all the way to the neck. Both head and neck are in an inclined fituation ; and the eminences and cavities of it anfwer to thofe in the body of the incus. The handle is looked upon by fome authors as one of the procefles of the malleus ; and, in that cafe, it is the greateft of the three. It forms an angle with the n<^ck and head ; near which it is fomething broad and fiat, and decreafes gradually towards its extremity. The procefs of the handle, termed by others the fmall or Jhort procefs of the*malleus, terminates in the angle already mentioned, being extended toward the neck, and lying in a firaight line with that fide or border of the handle which is next it. The procefs of the neck, called alio pro.effus gracilis, is, in a natural ftate, very long ; but fo Bender, that it is very eafily broken, efpecially when dry ; which is the reafon why the true length of it was for a long time un- known. It arifes from the neck, and fometimes appears much longer than it really is, by the addition of a fmall dried tendon flicking to it. When the malleus is in its true fituation, the head and neck are turned upward and inward ; the handle down- ward, parallel to the long leg of the incus, but more for- ward â€¢, the procefs of the handle upward and outward, ne-ir

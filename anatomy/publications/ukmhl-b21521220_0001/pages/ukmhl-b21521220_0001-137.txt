Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. *35 forated by a fmall hole, and on one fide of its balls two fmall bony filaments are often found in a parallel fituation ; and indeed it appears that they are feldom wanting, though their tender ftrudlure expofes them to be often broken. In the third eminence is a cavity fituated at the upper and a little toward the anterior part of the bottom of the tympanum. This cavity is part of a half canal, which, in a natural ftate, has one of the mufcles of the malleus lodged in it. The principal cavities in the tympanum are, The opening of the maftoid cells ; the opening of the Euftachian tube; the bony half canal; the feneftra ovalis and rotunda; and to thefe may be added the fmall hole in the pyramid. The openings of the maftoid qells are at the pofterior and upper part of the edge of the tympanum. The cells them- felves which end there are hollowed out in the fiibftance of the maftoid procefs, being very irregular, and full of windings and turnings. The opening of the Euftachian tube is at the anterior and upper part of the edge of the tympanum. It runs from the tympanum toward the pofterior openings of the noftrils and arch of the palate. Its bony portions, of which alone we here fpeak, is hollowed out in the pars petrofa, and is after- wards lengthened out by the fpinal procefs of the os fphe- noides. The maftoid cells, and the Euftachian tube, from their fituation, may in fome meafure be confidered as prolonga- tions of the tympanum. The bony half canal lies immediately above the Euftachian tube, toward the upper fide of die pars petrofa. In a natu- ral ftate, one of the mufcles of the malleus is lodged in it. The feneftra ovalis is a hole of communication between the tympanum and labyrinth. It lies immediately above the tuberofity ; the upper fide of it being a little rounded, the lower a little flattened, and has its longeft diameter from be- fore

It is probable that the primitive choice of our foods was made by experiments, according as the variety of fmells and flavours in vegetables and their feveral parts in- vited us, and as the ftrength or recruit of our faculties, from their ufe, confirmed their utility. But, by degrees, animals increafing fo much as to be incommodious to the hufband- man, and vegetables alone not being fufficient for fupporting them under their labours, the flefh of animals was afterwards added. At prefent, both the number and variety of fub- ftances are almoft infinite, which we take either as food or feafonina for cur nouriihment.

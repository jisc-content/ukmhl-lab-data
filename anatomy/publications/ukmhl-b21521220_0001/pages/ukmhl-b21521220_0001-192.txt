Part Vi* T$o THE MOUTH, laterally to the right or left, forward and backward. The various motions of the lower jaw have been already de- fcribed. The mufcles moving the lower jaw, which are weak in a man, but very ftrong in brute animals, are the temporalis and maffeter, which adt in concert, the temporal mulcle bringing the jaw more backwards, and the mafleter forwards. The pterygoidaeus interims elevates or draws it to one fide or the other alternately. The pterygoidaeus externus draws it forward and fidewife. The lower jaw is depreffcd, fo as to open the mouth by the digaftric or biventer mulcle. Moreover, the mouth may be partly opened by all the other lower mufcles of the jaw, os hyoides, and the larynx, as the genio-hyoidaeus, genio-gloffus, fterno-hyoidaeus, fterno-thyroidaeus, coraco-hyoidaeus, and lattiffimus colli ; although the latter rather draws the fkin of the neck and face downward than the jaw itfelf. The genio- hyoidaeus and digaftric mulcles have a power of drawing the jaw backwards. The lower jaw is elevated with a great force, fo as to divide the food by the prefiiire of the upper and lower teeth againft each other, by the action of the temporal, maffeter, and in- ternal pterygoid mufcles, the contraction of which appears by experiments to be very powerful, and fufficient to raife feveral hundred weight. The lateral and circular motions of the jaw are performed by the external and internal pterygoi- daei, aCting either alone or together. Thus the food is cut, lacerated, and ground to pieces; and, if the maftication be continued, it is, together with the liquors of the mouth, re- duced to a kind of pulp. During the trituration of the food in the mouth, there is continually poured into it, from numerous fprings, a large quantity of a watery, clear, evaporable, infipid, or at leaft but very

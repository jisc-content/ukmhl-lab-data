i6- Part VI. THE BRAIN, the broader. From thence M. Vieufiens took occafion to name this nucleus the centrum ovale. Ventrkuli laterales. Under this arch are two lateral cavi- ties, much longer than they are broad, and very thallow, fc- parated by a tran(parent medullary feptum ; of which here- after. Thefe cavities are generally named the anterior fupe- rior ventricles of the cerebrum, to diftinguifh them from two other fmaller cavities which are fituated more backward, as we fhall fee prefently ; but the name of lateral or great ven- tricles, given them by Steno, is more proper than cither of the other two. The lateral ventricles are broad, and rounded at thofe ex- tremities which lie next the tranfparent feptum. They go -from before backward, contrafling in breadth, and gradually feparating from each other in their progrefs. Afterwards they bend downward, and return obliquely from behind fore- ward, in a colirfe like the turning of a ramâ€™s horn, and ter- minate almoft under their fuperior extremities, only a little more backward and outward. At the pofterior part where they begin to bend downward, a particular elongation runs backward on each fide, and ter- minates in a triangular pointed cavity, turned a little inward, the two points refembling horns. Thefe ventricles are every where lined with a continuation of the pia mater. Septum lucidurh. The tranfparent partition, or feptum luci- dum, as it is commonly called, lies direflly under the raphe or future of the corpus calTofum, of which it is a continuation and a kind'of duplicature. It is made up of two medullary laminae, more or lefs feparated from each other by a narrow medullary cavity, fometimes filled with a ferous fubftance. This cavity, in fome fubjefb, reaches a great way backward, and feems to communicate with the third ventricle ; and, as Well as the other cavities of the brain, has been found full of water, in cafes of internal hydrocephalus.

Chap. II. LUNGS. 265 of the trachea which lies in the thorax; but out of the tho- rax, this firfl coat is derived from the aponeurotic expanfions of the muicles of the neck ; and it is between this and the following covering, that the glands already mentioned are fi- tuated. The fecond is a proper coat, being a continuation of the cellular covering of the lungs ; the pelliculae of which, neared the cartilaginous fegments, ferve them for an external peri- chondrium. The third membrane lies on the infide, adher- ing clofely to the lame cartilages, and fupplying to thefe the place of an internal perichondrium. The fourth membrane is that which completes the cir- cumference, of the cartilaginous circles of the trachea. It confifts chiefly of two laminae or flrata, partly mufcular and partly tendinous; die external or poflerior laminaâ€™ confiding of longitudinal fibres ; an clothe internal, or anterior, of traniverie fibres. This membrane is perforated by the fmall dutfls of the above mentioned glands, which dilcharge a fluid when prefled, and being examined through a microlcope, they appear veficular or folliculous, much like that of the flomach The ligaments between the cartilaginous circles are very flrong and elaflic ; and each of them is confined to two car- tilages, without communicating with any of the red, being fix- ed to the edges of thefe cartilages, much in the lame manner as the intercodal mufcles are inierted in the ribs. As the bronchia penetrate into the fubdance of the lungs, they gradually lofe their cartilages, till at lad th< y become purely membranous ; but the mulcular lines of M. Morgagni appear as much, and fometimes more than before. The two planes, above mentioned, continue likewife to be vifible ; and we obferve very difiinclly, fometimes even without a micro- scope, a great many fmall holes in the pellicles of the lobuli, Vol. II.

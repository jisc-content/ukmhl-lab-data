34° DIGESTION. Part VI. der the denomination of flatus, diflends the ftomach more than the food iifelf. While it is extricated, the aliments be- gin to corrupt or change into a naufeous liquid, often acef- cent, or otherwife putrelcent, which however happens lefs in mankind from our ufe ot bread and fait. It is frequently rancefcent, a- appears from jhe flatus, and often of a moffc fetid, cauflic, and inflammable nature. This putrefcency, or imperfect putrefaction, fays Haller, is almoft the only caufe of digeftion in fiHi, ferpents, and carnivorous birds. Hence, in mankind, metals themfelves, by long (lay in the itomach, grow foft, and are eroded ; but, from Spallanzani’s experi- ments, it appears that there are no figns of putrefaction in 'the time of digeftion, except in fick animals. (See Experi- ments on Digefton, &c.). During digeftion there is no lenfe of hunger, for the nervous plicae of the ftomach are kept from grating on each other by the interpofition of the food ; and they are^ not affcCted by the gaftric juice, which, in di- geftion, aCts on the aliment. The aliment is prevented from becoming completely acid, by the heat ; by the gaftric juices ; by the faliva, which is rather alkalelcent, and fwallowed to the amount of half an ounce in an hour •, and by the bile which frequently regurgi- tates into tiie ftomach. i here is no particular kind of fer- ment in the ltoaiach ; from which the defign of nature, the dilpoliiion ot the Itomach, and its ufe, are all very remote. And yet the juice ot the ftomach alone, efpecially in fifties, difloives the bones of other fifties, which they had devoured. (See Spallanzani’s'Experiments). To the preceding theory of digeftion, taken from Haller, we fliall add an abridged account of fonie experiments, ex- tracted from the ingenious Mr Smellie’s Philotophy ot Natu- ral Hiftory. « Dr Stevens, in an Inaugural Piflertation concerning Di- geftion, pubiiflied at Edinburgh in the year 1777* ma^c feveral

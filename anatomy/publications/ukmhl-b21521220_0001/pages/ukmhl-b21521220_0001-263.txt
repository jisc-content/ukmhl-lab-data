The eighth pair, and great fvmpnthetic nerves, form, helvnd each lung, a particular interrexture, called plexus putmenans s front ivhence nervous filaments go out, which communicate with the plexus cardiacus and ftouiachicus. Lymphatic vejfels. On the furfoce cf the human lungs, between the external and cellular coat, we obfirve lymphatic vtfi Is: 13ut we ought to take care not to miffake for fuch veflels a tranfparent reticular fubftance oblervable on the furface of the lungs, after blowing llrongly into the lobuli ; this appearance being entirely owing to the air which pafies through the bronchial veficles into the interlobular cells, and which, by fâ€™eparating a certain number of lobuli, finds room to lodge between them. Ligament/. Under the root of each lung, that is, under that part formed by the lubordinate trunk of the pulmonary artery, by the trunks of the pulmonary veins, and by the trunk of the bronchia, there is a broad membranous liga- ment which ties the polterior edge of each lung to the late- ral parts of the vertebrae of the back, from that root all the Way to the diaphr igmi. Trachea arteria. The bronchia already deferibed are bran- ches or ramifications of a large canal, partly cartilaginous, and partly membranous, called trachea or afpera arteria. It is fituaud anteriorly, in the lower part of the neck, from whence it runs down into the thorax between the two plue- rae, through the upper fpace left between the duplicature of the medialtinum. behind the thymus. Having reached as low as the curvature of the aorta, it di- vides into two lateral parts, one toward the right, the other toward the left, which enter the lungs, and are difiributed through them in the manner already deferibed, Thelc two branches

Part VI. ^3° PENIS. But before this fpongy fubltance begins to furround the urethra, it forms a diffiruft oblong body, like a pear, which is connected only to the lower convex fide of the canal; and afterwards being fplit on each fide, inverts it quite round. This body is called the bulb of the urethra, being larger than any other part of that canal, and divided interiorly by a very fine membranous feptum into two lateral parts ; and there- fore, when it is inflated, it appears to be double, or with tw© heads. Lacunae of the urethra The infide of the canal of the ure- thra is lined by a fine membrane, full of capillary blood-vef- fels ; and its furface is perforated by a great number of ob- long holes, or fmall lacunae of differentfizes, the largert ly- ing near the glans. Thefe lacunae or orifices of the excretory duds of the fame number of fmall glands, are difperfed through the iubftance of the urethra :• which duds run for fome way in the fpongy fiibftance along the convex fide of the internal membrane of the urethra, and open obliquely from behind forward into the great canal. The edges of the lacunae are femilunar, or like a crefcent, becaufe of the obliquity of their opening. Anti-profatae. A little way before the veru-montanum, without the urethra, we meet with two lacunae more confi- derable than the reft, and their duds are very long. Thefe lacunae and duds lead to two glandular bodies, fituated, one on.each fide, between the pofterior and lateral parts of the mufculi acceleratores urinae, and the bulb of the urethra. Each of them is about the fize of a garden pea ; but they are obl6ng and flat, and covered entirely by the accelerator mufcles. They are known by the name ofprofatae inferiores ; but if their fituation be carefully examined, they will be found to be higher than the true proftatae. They are like wife term- ed glandulae mucofae of Coiuper, who has given a defcription •f them(y« Phil. Tranf. 1699); but they were firft defcrib- ed >

RESPIRATION. Part V*. healthy adult perfon ; becaufe, whether the lungs remaih long in a fiate either of exfpiration or infpiration, we fee death will foon be the confequence. No animal, therefore, that has lungs like ourfelves, after it has once breathed, and received the air into the inmoft parrs of the lungs, and by that means brought a new and large quantity of blood to that vifeus, can fubfift longer than a few minutes without the ufe and benefit of a free air; but it will either perifh, or at leaft fall into fuch a ftate as differs from death only in its being recoverable again by certain powers or a&ions. In an animal lately born, this neceffity for air does not take place fo fud- denly. But the ufe of refpiration is different from this neceffity j which nature might have avoided, either by ufing no lungs at all, or elfe by difpofing them in a manner relembling thofe cf the foetus. This ufe, therefore, of refpiration mud be very-confiderable, fince all animals are either made with lungs, or with gills, as in filh, or elfe with a trachea dilperfed through, all parts of the body. In order to difeover this ufefulnefs of refpiration, let us compare the blood of an adult perfon with that of a foetus, and alfo with the fame vital fluid in fifhes. It appears then in a foetus, that the blood is deftitute of its florid rednefs and fo- lid denfity •, and in the blood of fiflies, we obferve there is n* ■heat, the denfity inconfiderable, and but little craffamenturh contained in it; and therefore we are perfuaded, by the na- ture of thefe circumflances, that the blood acquires all thefe properties in the lungs. It may be afleed, therefore, Whether the blood d®es not acquire its heat principally in the lungs ? But this does not arife from the alternate extenfion and contraction, relaxation and compreffion, of the pulmonary veffels, by which the fo'- lid parts of the blood are perpetually rubbed and clofely compretfed. The lungs, therefore, will add to the office of the

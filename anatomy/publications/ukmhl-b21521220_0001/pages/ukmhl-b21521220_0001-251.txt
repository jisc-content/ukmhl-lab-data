*4 9 CIRCULATION. &c. Chap. II. § 8. Of the Circulation or Motion of the blood through the Ar- teries and Vems. The arteries and veins contain either blood or lvmph. The red blood fills thole arteries and veins which we call red, or of the fir It order, and which have their origin in the heart. Sometimes they are very loolely and imperfectly diilended by the blood, and at other times they are rendered very full and turgid. After death, the veins are found fuller of blood than the arte- ries; and fomerimes, when the peil'on has been dead a con- fiderabie time, the lmall veins have been found diftended with air. But the arteries of a dead body commonly contain only a fmall quantity of blood. 1 his defending blood is rapidly moved through all the vef- fels of a living body, as is demonftrated to us lrom wounds ; and the patient foontr or later expires from the lof's if fo much blood as was neceflary for the maintenance of life; this lols of blood Happens almoll inflantly from the h.rger arteries, and fometimts very fuddenly from the Imaller ones ; But from the veins, unlefs they are fome of the largeft, it is generally flow; yet are there not wanting inflances of fa'al hemorrhagies from wounds of the veins, in the inner corners of the eyes, and thofe under the tongue. Experiments made upon living animals iufficiently evince the impulfe and rapi- dity with which the blood is moved, particularly through the arteries. The height to which blood afeended from the carotids, when cut, according to Hale’s calculation, Dr Wr fberg law confirmed in robuft men who were be- headed: It is generally about feven feet, with this dif- ference, however, that in two examples the blood fprung higher from the vertebrals than from the carotids. In the larger trunks it runs fwifteft, but in the leaft of them, fomewhat flower. In the larger veins, the blood’s celerity Vol. II. I i ;s

397 KIDNEYS and URETERS. Chap. III. fmall corpufcles are perhaps only the extremities of, veflels, filled either with blood or with a coloured injection. The other two fubflances, thpt is, the medullary or ftria- ted, and the papillary, are really but one and the fame mafs, of a more- reddilh colour; the convex fide of which riles at Several places into narrow tubercles, lodged in the fame num- ber of cavities or dej reifions. The radiated firiae are after- war'f ontmued to the papillary portion ; and the papillae form, in lo.iue mealure, lo many centres of thefe radii; oppo- fite to tne tubfcrcles. The medullary li.bftance is likewife diftinguifhed from the cortical, by the arterial and venal arches, which lend capilla- ry ramifications cn ali hands; and its colour is more or lefs red. The papillae, which are only a continuation of the medul- lary fubftance, as has been laid, are often a little paler than that fubftance. They are ten or twelve in number, very dif- tinct from each other, refembling the fame number of cones, with very broad bales and obtufe apices. At the point of each papillae we fee, even without a mi- croicope, in a flight depreffion, feveral very fmall holes, through which little drops may be perceived to run when the papillae are comprefied. Thefe are little drops of urine, â€¢ which', being filtered, partly in the cortical, partly in the mediillary or tubular fubftance, afterwards pafs through the fubftance of the papillae, and are difeharged by thefe orifi- ces. The pelvis of ihe kidneys. Each papilla lies in- a kind of membranous calix or infundibulum/which opens into a com- mon cavity, called the pelvis. This pelvis is membranous, being of the fame ftrufture with the calices, of which it is a continuation ; an'd its cavity in man is not uniform, but dif- tinguifhed into three portions,' each of which contains a cer- tain number of infundibula or calices, together with the pa-

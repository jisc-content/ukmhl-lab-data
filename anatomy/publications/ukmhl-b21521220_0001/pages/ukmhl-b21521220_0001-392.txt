390 SECRETION- of the BILE. Part VI. branch of the vena portarum can feparate bile into the gall- bladder ; for that vein in i'felf is a m> re reconductory vrflel: Nor can any be feparated from the hep.uic artery; for it muff be vaftly beyond probability, that fuch a tirorig bile as that of the gall-bladder fhould be fe|'arated from a milder blood than that from which the mild hepatic bile is prepa- red. Laffly, the bile flows alfo from the gall-bladder to the li- ver, and at length returns' into the blood, when its pafiage * into the inteftines is totally intercepted. A latent cauie in the nerves may alfo occafion this regurgitation. This paflage or abforption of the bile into the fyflem is pernicious, and is the occafion of jaundice ; which, when the offending ftones or concretions are removed, is cured by the bileâ€™s tree courfe 1 into the duodenum being reffored, A portion of the hepatic bi|e being received into the gall- bladder, there ftagnates, and is only a little ihak,en by reipi- ration By degrees it there exhales its thinner parts, which, we fee penetrate and filtrate through the adjacent membranes. The remainder being a fluid of an oily fubalkalme nature, digefted in a warm place, grows (harp, rancid, more thick, bitter, and of a high colour : For this is the only difference between the cyffic and hepatic bile ; the later being weaker, lefs bitter, lighter coloured, and of a thinner confidence, while it remains within its proper hepatic duffs. Th.it the difference between them proceeds only from fhgnation, ap- pears from fuch animals as have only a larger pe.rus hepati- cus, inftead of a gallbladder; for here we find the bile, which ftagnates in the larger hepatic pore, is confiderabiy more bitter than that in the fmaller pores of the liver; as, for example, in the elephant. But the gall-bladder gives this particular advantage, that it receives the bile when the flo- lpach, being empty, has. no need for it, that afterwards it may be able to return it in greater plenty, when we princi- pally

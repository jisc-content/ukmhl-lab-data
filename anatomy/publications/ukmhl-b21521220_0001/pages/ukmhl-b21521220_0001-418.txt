4io Part VI. TESTES. i The inner furface of this coat is lined by a fine membrane, which ftrengthens the bottom of the vagina, and forms a kind of diaphragm, which prevents all communication be- tween the vagina of the i'permatic rope, and the tunica vagi- nalis of the tefticle. Cremajler. The cremafter, improperly termed a caat, is a thin muicle or flclhy plane, which runs down round the va- gina of the fpermatic rope, and terminates in the tunica va- ginalis of the tefticle. It furrounds almoft the whole vagina, and afterwards ex- pands itfelf on the upper and external part of the tunica va- ginalis, in which it is inferted and loll. It arifes partly from the ligamentum Fallopii, but chiefly from the lower edge of the internal oblique mufcle of the ab- domen. It is covered by a very fine cellular membrane, detached from the outfide of the aponeurofis of the obliquus externus, round the opening commonly called the ring. This mem- brane is loft in the cellular fubftauce of the inftde of the dartos. From all this we fee, that the cremafter is rather a tufcle of the tunica vaginalis than a particular coat. Thofe among the antients who believed it to be a coat, called it tunica ery- throides, from a Greek word which iigniiies red; but this muicle is not always red, neither is that colour elfemially neceflary to a flefhy fubftance. Tcjlcs. The teftes are two glandular bodies, fkuated near each other, without the abdomen, below the interftice between the groins in an adult. The antients named them didymi or gemini. Their flze is nearly that of a pigeonâ€™s egg, and they are of an oval figure, a little flated at each fide. But they are frequently unequal in flze in the fame perfon. Fabricius ab Aquapender.te, was confulted freque .ly by perfbns who believed they had got a difeafed tefticle, bccaufe it was larger than
